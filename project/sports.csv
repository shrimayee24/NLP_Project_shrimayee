Triple talaq: When a word becomes a weapon

What changed, and when

The unresolved ‘what now’

Back to the doorstep

Instant triple talaq isn't some abstract religious custom — it's a brutal power play that shatters lives in seconds. A husband utters three words, and a woman loses her home, income, and future.""Some marriages are 6 months old, but some are also 10 years old. It all ended in a moment,"" says Nazreen Ansari, national president of Muslim Mahila Foundation. “In one instance, a husband living in Saudi Arabia divorced his wife through an email message. The woman was uneducated and helpless — she had no means of seeking justice.”When a marriage ends impulsively, women bear the full blow. Joint accounts freeze, bills mount, and ""adjusting"" becomes code for suffering silently to avoid scandal.Even with adult children or parents, support often evaporates. Priyanka Sharma , counselor at Shanti Sahyog, shares: ""Who bears the blow of impulsive actions? The woman does. The man can break away, but her family may refuse to remarry her.""The real question isn't ""What does the law say?""—it's ""Where will she go?"" and ""Who will pay?""This isn't courtroom theater; it's a doorstep disaster.Picture a ration list slashed, a landlord pounding for rent, school fees piling up unpaid, and a phone buzzing with sympathy laced with judgment.At the centre of the churn is a simple idea that India has still not made emotionally uncomplicated: maintenance is not charity.It is the legal recognition that unpaid labour, shared households, and dependent lives do not disappear the moment a husband says the marriage is over.Yet time and again, a woman’s survival claim—food, rent, medicines, children’s fees—has been recast as a political dispute about identity, community autonomy and the state’s limits.The topic has forever garnered public attention, but with the release of the movie ‘Haq’, this discourse has yet again found its way to the people’s domain.In separation and divorce, the loss is immediate and material.Women in such disputes often describe a sudden stop in cash flow. The joint account that becomes inaccessible, the monthly expenses that remain stubbornly monthly, and the social pressure to “adjust” because litigation is seen as a public scandal.Even when adult children exist, they are not always economically stable; even when parents exist, they are not always willing or able to take a daughter back.“I remember one case where a woman faced triple talaq in anger. Her husband said it impulsively. Later, her parents insisted she reconcile, but she had suffered a lot. In such cases, women endure the most. They’re pressured by society and family alike,” Priyanka recalls.For many, the marital home is not just a place—it is the only affordable roof.“Who bears the blow of impulsive actions? The woman does, of course. The man in the relationship can break away from the marriage, but in many cases, the girl’s family do not even want her to get married to someone else,” explains Priyanka Sharma, counsellor and community mobiliser at Shanti Sahyog.While some families insist their daughters to reconcile, in other cases, the husband himself has a change of heart. Ansari shares the scenario for women who have to remarry their husbands.“If he later regrets it and wishes to return, the practice of halala becomes another form of exploitation for women,” Nazreen says.She further goes on to elaborate on the other side of the case.“Even after a marriage is ended completely, for how long can the woman sustain herself? Or for how long can her parents look after her and her kids?” Nazreen questions the fate of women who are then left with an uncertain future.That is why maintenance matters. For the woman who has not been earning, or earns too little to restart life overnight, maintenance is what stands between dignity and destitution.The politics begins when this basic safety net is framed not as a welfare-like protection in a modern republic but as an intrusion into personal law.Both Nazreen Ansari and Priyanka Sharma have had encounters with cases of women who had to go through triple talaq. Many cases came after the divorce; however, many also came before the divorce.“We first ask the women what they want—whether they wish to continue living with their families or not. Then, we call both parties for counselling sessions. Many families reconcile and continue living together after such sessions,” Sharma says, “If reconciliation fails, the cases are referred to CAW Cells or legal authorities for divorce proceedings.”Nazreen shares two cases she saw.“In the first case, a woman I knew personally was expecting her first child when her husband stopped speaking to her. His family pressured him to divorce her,” she says.“We intervened and guided her to approach the family court. Over time, the couple reconciled and is now living happily with two children — a son and a daughter,” Ansari shared the story of reconciliation.“In the second case,” she adds, “a woman who was abandoned by her husband had no means to support herself or her child.”In those cases, Ansari’s NGO help women counsel and guide them to get back on their feet.“Initially, she depended on her parents, but that wasn’t sustainable. We counselled her and helped her set up a small shop. Today, she is financially independent and raising her child on her own.”In the Indian legal system, Section 144 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), earlier Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, has often been described in plain terms as an anti-destitution measure. It is meant to prevent dependents—wives, children, parents—from being left without support.Its logic is secular: the state steps in so that private abandonment does not become public poverty.But when women from religious minorities invoke a provision that looks “uniform” in its application, the argument quickly leaves the home and enters the arena of identity.Critics see it as the state imposing a one-size-fits-all morality; supporters see it as the state finally doing what it is supposed to do—protect vulnerable citizens regardless of faith.The woman, meanwhile, is usually asking for something less philosophical. She asks for a sum that can keep a family afloat.The Shah Bano case became the national turning point because it placed these questions under the harshest light.Shah Bano Begum, an elderly divorced Muslim woman, sought maintenance under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The dispute moved through the courts until it reached the Supreme Court, which ruled in her favour—affirming, in effect, that a religion-neutral maintenance provision could apply and that the prevention of destitution was a constitutional and civic concern.The verdict did more than decide one case. It signalled that the language of equality and welfare could reach into domains governed by religious personal law.For many women’s rights advocates, it looked like overdue justice. For many within the community, it felt like a warning bell: if the state can do this on maintenance, what comes next?Those “what next” anxieties—never purely legal, always political—helped convert a maintenance dispute into a referendum on minority identity and state power.The backlash to Shah Bano was swift and loud.Protests, public mobilisation and political messaging turned the case into a pressure test for the government of the day: stand by a court’s expansive reading of women’s protection, or defuse community anger by narrowing the verdict’s effect.Parliament’s response—the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986—was widely read by critics as a rollback that diluted the Supreme Court’s reasoning. Supporters defended it as necessary to respect Muslim personal law.Courts, over time, tried to interpret the law in ways that did not abandon the goal of preventing destitution.But the damage to the larger idea was already done. It told the country that even the highest court’s gender-justice moment could be politically “managed” into something smaller.Decades after Shah Bano, the conversation returned through a different door: instant triple talaq—talaq pronounced thrice in one sitting, treated by some as an immediate end to marriage.For women, the complaint was not abstract theology; it was lived harm.A marriage could be terminated abruptly, often without due process, without meaningful negotiation, and with the woman suddenly pushed into economic and social free fall.The moral and political arguments split predictably. Reformers called it arbitrary and cruel. Defenders warned against state interference and majoritarian impulses. But again, the practical issue was urgent: in many cases, the instantness of the divorce multiplied vulnerability—especially where women had limited income, limited family support, and limited access to legal help.Legal change came in two steps.First, in 2017, the Supreme Court set aside instant triple talaq, holding that it could not survive constitutional scrutiny in the form it was being defended. In plain terms, the practice was invalidated: a pronouncement could not, by itself, instantly snap a marriage in a way that left women without protection.Second, in 2019, Parliament enacted a law that made the pronouncement of instant triple talaq void and illegal, adding criminal penalties.This is where a new—and politically charged—question emerged.Should a civil vulnerability be addressed through criminal law?Supporters argued that strong deterrence was necessary because women had been ignored for too long. Critics argued that criminalisation could create fresh risks. It could harden family conflict, it could be misused, and it could complicate the very maintenance and support women need by pushing the husband into the criminal justice system.The law on paper is only the beginning. The lived reality depends on access: whether a woman can find a lawyer, whether she can afford repeated court dates, whether the police station feels like protection or intimidation, whether family pressure forces an out-of-court settlement that leaves her short-changed, and whether a maintenance order is actually enforced.Politically, personal law reform remains high-voltage.Every intervention is interpreted through partisan lenses. Every verdict is packaged into slogans. And every woman who steps into the system is quietly asked to carry the weight of a national argument she did not start.The country’s big debates—personal law, religious law, minority rights—often arrive at a woman’s home in small, sharp ways: the neighbour’s whisper, the relative’s ultimatum, the landlord’s deadline.The question she lives with is not whether India will one day have uniform family law. It is whether her children will stay in school, whether she can afford medicine, and whether she has a bed to sleep on next month.In India’s personal-law battles, the loudest slogans are rarely the ones that keep a woman housed.","Triple talaq is a brutal power play that shatters lives in seconds.

T20 World Cup | 'Our flight is booked and we are going' - Suryakumar Yadav on Pakistan's boycott

The impasse over the India-Pakistan T20 WC match showed no signs of being resolved, after Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif weighed in on the issue, calling their boycott of the February 15 match against India in Colombo an “appropriate decision”. It was a “considered stance” to support Bangladesh, he said.“We have taken a very clear stand on the T20 World Cup that we won’t play the match against India because there should be no politics on the sports field. We have taken a very considered stance, and we should completely stand by Bangladesh, and I think this is a very appropriate decision. We are with Bangladesh,” the PM said.Meanwhile, Bangladesh Youth and Sports Advisor Asif Nazrul acknowledged Sharif’s decision. “Thank you, Pakistan,” Nazrul wrote in a social media post.As the start of this contentious World Cup nears, speaking at a pre-tournament captain’s press conferences from two different locations – Mumbai’s BCCI headquarters and from Colombo — both teams’ captains broke their silence on the issue.“We haven’t refused to play against Pakistan. They have refused. The mindset is pretty clear. We have not said no, it has come from them,” India skipper Suryakumar Yadav said.“The ICC has given a fixture, BCCI and the (Indian) govt has decided with the ICC on playing at a neutral venue. Our flight is booked for Colombo and we are going,” he added.Salman Ali Agha, his Pakistani opposite number, said, “The India game is not in our control. It’s the govt’s and PCB’s decision and we respect that. Whatever they are going to say, we will do that.”“If we have to play them again in the semifinal or final, we will have to go back to them (govt) and act on their advice,” added the Pakistan skipper. The Indian captain acknowledged that the situation is “not easy” for those involved in the issue, including the ICC.“I feel it is not an easy job. It is not my call. I am sure they (the ICC) might be working out something as well but it has come from the other govt or the nation, how can they (the ICC) help as well? Their (Pakistan’s) decision is not in my control. I wish I could take their decisions, but then it is their call,” said Suryakumar.“We have been told that we have to play a game in Colombo on Feb 15th. We played them three times in the Asia Cup, we played some good cricket. We won (all the matches) and we were very happy. Similarly, if we get an opportunity in Colombo, we will definitely play,” he added.Earlier, Inter national Cricket Council (ICC) had expressed serious concerns over the Pakistan govt’s decision.“This position of selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule,” it had said. “This decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide.”","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif calls their boycott of the February 15 match against India in Colombo an “appropriate decision’ India captain Suryakumar Yadav: “The ICC has given a fixture, BCCI and the (Indian) govt has decided with the ICC on playing at a neutral venue”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127969189,imgsize-493153,width-400,resizemode-4/india-vs-pakistan.jpg"
"After 44 Years, BJP returns to Mumbai mayor’s office: Ritu Tawde set to be elected unopposed; end of Thackeray era in BMC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-44-years-bjp-returns-to-mumbai-mayors-office-ritu-tawde-set-to-be-elected-unopposed-end-of-thackeray-era-in-bmc/articleshow/128040287.cms,"Sanjay Ghadi and Ritu Tawde (PTI image)

“Democracy Sliding Into ICU”: Opposition Targets BJP As BMC Polls Trigger Political Storm

NEW DELHI: BJP corporator Ritu Tawde is set to become Mumbai’s next mayor after being elected unopposed, marking the party’s return to the post after 44 years and ending the Shiv Sena’s uninterrupted 25-year hold over the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).The contest turned uncontested after the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT) decided not to field a challenger against Tawde, effectively clearing her path to the mayor’s office. Though the mayor’s role is largely ceremonial, it carries strong political and symbolic significance in Mumbai’s identity-driven civic politics.Tawde’s elevation will be the BJP’s first mayoral win in Mumbai since Prabhakar Pai’s tenure in 1982–83. It also means the undivided Shiv Sena, which controlled the BMC from 1997 to 2022, will not hold the mayor’s post after nearly three decades.On the final day of nominations, the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, a BJP ally in the ruling Mahayuti, nominated Sanjay Ghadi as its candidate for deputy mayor. The party announced that the deputy mayor’s tenure would be split, allowing multiple corporators to serve during the term.A senior BMC official told PTI that only one nomination each was received for the mayor’s and deputy mayor’s posts before the 6 pm deadline. “We have received just one nomination from BJP’s Ritu Tawde for the mayor’s post and another from Sanjay Ghadi for the deputy mayor’s post,” the official said.Although opposition parties have not filed nominations, the election process will be formally completed on February 11, which is also the last day for withdrawal of nominations. The mayor’s post has been reserved for a woman candidate from the open category following a draw of lots by the Urban Development Department.Tawde (53), a corporator from Ghatkopar East, filed her nomination at the municipal secretary’s office in the presence of senior Mahayuti leaders, including minister Mangal Prabhat Lodha and BJP Mumbai unit chief Ameet Satam.Speaking to reporters, she said a safer and more developed Mumbai was her priority and that she wanted to work for citizens of the cosmopolitan city.The Shiv Sena (UBT) was expected to challenge the BJP nominee but decided against it after a meeting at party chief Uddhav Thackeray’s residence. Former Mumbai mayor and Sena (UBT) leader Kishori Pednekar said the decision reflected respect for Marathi identity.“The BJP had to accept that Marathi manoos is a Hindu. If the mayor of Mumbai is Marathi manoos, we won’t do anything that amounts to a bad omen. We have accepted the arithmetic and will play the role of a strong opposition and fight for Mumbai,” Pednekar said.The Sena (UBT) had raised the Marathi identity plank in last month’s BMC elections, where it contested in alliance with the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). The BJP emerged as the single largest party with 89 seats in the 227-member civic body. The ruling Mahayuti alliance, with a combined strength of 118 corporators, comfortably crossed the halfway mark of 114.Addressing a press conference earlier in the day, BJP’s Satam said that the city was set to get a BJP mayor after four decades. “We have the backing of 118 corporators and the support of more members. The Mahayuti will work to free the BMC from the clutches of corruption,” he said.Satam also said that the alliance had asserted from the beginning that Mumbai’s mayor would be Marathi and Hindu. “The city will now get a Marathi, Malvani, Konkani and Hindu mayor,” he added.Reacting sharply, the NCP (SP) criticised the BJP’s choice, saying selecting a former Congress leader as mayor had demoralised party loyalists. NCP (SP) spokesperson Clyde Crasto said, “By choosing a former Congresswoman as mayor, the BJP has insulted its own loyal corporators who have given their blood, sweat and tears for the party.”Tawde, who joined the BJP in 2012 after quitting the Congress, was elected as a corporator the same year. During her first term, she chaired the BMC’s Education Committee and raised issues related to infrastructure, water supply and public safety. She was also in the spotlight for raising objections to mannequins displaying objectionable clothing in shops.Ghadi, a corporator from Ward No. 5 who defected from Sena (UBT) to the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, will serve as deputy mayor for 15 months, party secretary Sanjay More said.The BMC, India’s richest civic body, has been under a state-appointed administrator since March 2022 following the end of the previous term. Its budget for 2025–26 stands at Rs 74,450 crore, higher than that of several Indian states.","BJP corporator Ritu Tawde is set to become Mumbai’s next mayor after being elected unopposed.

When music turns into prayer: Inside the world of 'bhajan concerts',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-music-turns-into-prayer-inside-the-world-of-bhajan-concerts/articleshow/128033433.cms,"AI-generated image (Picture credit: OpenAI via ChatGPT)



Imagine a musical gathering where there is no chaotic crowd pushing past you, no frenzy to get closer to the stage and no noise competing with the music.Instead, people sit in quiet anticipation, moving in rhythm, listening as much as they sing.Imagine a musical evening where the audience is not driven by spectacle, but by the steady beats of a harmonium, tabla and manjira.The sound from the speakers does not overwhelm. It settles gently, carrying chants and sacred names that seem to resonate somewhere deeper than sound itself.Here, the audience is not screaming. Some sit with their eyes closed, absorbing the melody. Others clap softly before slowly rising to their feet, singing and swaying together in an unspoken rhythm.The artist, too, remains seated. Calm, composed, guiding the music rather than performing for applause.There is an atmosphere that feels simple and sacred. Children sit beside grandparents, both equally immersed in the experience.And when the evening ends, the venue remains orderly but something within you feels quieter, as if an inner clutter has briefly come to rest.If this sounds unlike a concert, that is because it is. And yet, it is exactly what a bhajan or a kirtan concert feels like.Over the past few years, devotional and spiritual music gatherings have begun drawing noticeably larger and younger audiences across India and among the global diaspora.Large-scale kirtan and bhajan events are increasingly being hosted in auditoriums and convention centres rather than only temples or community spaces. This shift can likely be attributed to a growing search for experiences that combine music, community and emotional grounding in an otherwise fast-paced urban life.The growing visibility of such gatherings has also entered public discourse. In one of his recent Mann Ki Baat addresses, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about the cultural significance of bhajans and collective devotional practices.“Large numbers of the youth are gathering in different cities across the country. The stage is decorated... there is lighting, music... there is all the pomp and show, and the atmosphere is no less than a concert. It feels like a huge concert, but what is being sung there is the resonance of bhajans sung with complete concentration, dedication, and rhythm. This trend is being called ‘bhajan-clubbing’ today, and it’s becoming increasingly popular, especially among Gen Z,” PM said.The reference indicated how devotional music, once confined largely to religious or local settings, is now being discussed in the context of social and cultural engagement at a national level.My introduction to this world came through the music of international spiritual artist Radhika Das.I had first encountered his work online a few years ago. His videos, blending traditional Indian kirtan with contemporary musical arrangements, stood out immediately.Watching chants of Radhe Radhe Govinda echo through spaces like London’s Union Chapel felt both familiar and unexpectedly global.The energy in those videos, where people sang and danced together in devotion, sparked a curiosity in me. I wanted to experience that atmosphere firsthand.At the time, it seemed unlikely. Das appeared to be largely based in the UK and I assumed attending one of his concerts would remain a distant possibility. When I later discovered he had toured India, I realised I had missed the opportunity. Disappointed but hopeful, I made a quiet promise to myself, the next time he returned, I would attend.A year later, life had moved on. College had given way to my first newsroom job. My usual days were spent scanning agency wires and chasing stories.One such routine afternoon, an entertainment wire, the kind that often resembles promotional material, caught my eye. I almost scrolled past it before a familiar name made me pause. Radhika Das. It was an announcement of his upcoming India tour.Within minutes, I was searching for tickets. The early bird window was open and without much hesitation, I booked one.Only later did I wonder whether any of my friends would be interested in attending a bhajan concert. After some persuasion and a few shared YouTube clips one friend agreed, more out of curiosity than conviction. The plan was set.Months later, the evening finally arrived.Like most evenings in Delhi, the plan to reach early remained only a plan. After navigating traffic and a hurried entry into the YashoBhoomi Convention Centre, the atmosphere began to shift even before the music started.Volunteers greeted attendees warmly, applying tilaks as people entered the hall. The auditorium slowly filled, carrying an air of anticipation rather than impatience.When Das and his team took the stage, the applause felt welcoming rather than frenzied. He began not with high energy, but with stillness, asking the audience to close their eyes and take a few deep breaths, as if preparing everyone to arrive fully in the moment.What followed was a gradual transformation. The chants of ""Namah Shivaya"" and later ""Sita-Ram"" spread across the hall, moving the audience from silence to participation.Without realising it, people who had begun the evening seated found themselves clapping, swaying and eventually dancing.Strangers smiled at one another, united by rhythm rather than familiarity. My friend, initially unsure of what to expect, was soon completely absorbed in the atmosphere.Between performances, Das spoke about the significance of chanting and the role devotion had played in shaping his own journey.His reflections were simple, often humorous, but resonated with the audience.At one point, he narrated a story about a devotee, playfully referred to as ‘Patel’, that drew laughter across the hall but also carried an unmistakable sense of recognition.In the story, the devotee is repeatedly invited by Krishna (the divine) to leave worldly life and return to the spiritual realm.Each time, however, he requests more time: first to complete his education, then to build a career, later to marry, raise children, and fulfil responsibilities. Years pass and the invitation keeps getting postponed.When the divine messenger finally returns, he learns that Patel has passed away — only to discover that he has been reborn as a household dog, still attached to worldly duties, still asking for more time.The audience laughed, but the humour carried an underlying message that many seemed to relate to.The story mirrored a familiar human tendency, the constant belief that spiritual reflection can wait until everything else is settled. In that shared laughter, there was also a moment of quiet self-awareness visible across the hall.As the evening progressed, the music intensified. The final performance, ""Bhajman Radhe Radhe Govinda"", became the emotional peak of the concert.Speaking about his recent visit to Vrindavan and his connection with India as his spiritual home, Das’s voice carried visible emotion. The audience responded in kind. Hands raised, eyes closed, voices merging into a collective chant. For a brief moment, the boundaries between performer and audience seemed to dissolve.Nearly two hours passed unnoticed. Concerns about late-night travel or early workdays faded into the background.When the music finally stopped, there was a lingering reluctance to leave, the familiar feeling of returning to ordinary life after an experience that felt unusually immersive.As we walked out, I asked my friend if it had been worth coming. He smiled and simply said, “I still have goosebumps.” It was perhaps the simplest summary of the evening.For me, the experience also reshaped what a concert could mean. Previous concerts I had attended were defined by crowd anxiety or performative spectacle. This felt different, less like entertainment and more like participation.Bhajan concerts may appear to be a modern phenomenon, but their roots run deep within India’s cultural traditions.The practice of naam sankirtan, popularised by saints such as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, has long brought communities together through collective singing and devotion.Whether in Maharashtra’s Warkari tradition, local jagrans or household kirtans, the essence has remained the same, music as a shared spiritual expression.This idea finds resonance in classical devotional literature as well. In the Ramcharitmanas, Goswami Tulsidas writes, “Kaliyug keval naam adhaara, sumir sumir nar utarahin paara,” suggesting that in an age marked by distraction and restlessness, remembrance through the divine name becomes a path to inner steadiness.Seen in that context, the contemporary bhajan concert appears less like an innovation and more like a continuation, a familiar tradition finding new form for a new generation.What seems to be changing today is the format. A younger audience is rediscovering these traditions through contemporary presentation, larger venues, and global artists who bridge devotional music with modern sensibilities.As I hurried towards the metro later that night, the chants of ""Radhe Radhe Govinda"" still playing in my head, it felt as though the concert had ended but something quieter had begun.The bridge to that experience may have closed with the final note but it had also revealed a path, one that each listener perhaps continues to walk on their own.","Over the past few years, devotional and spiritual music gatherings have begun drawing noticeably larger and younger audiences across India and among the global diaspora.

How Shashi Tharoor-Congress 'Hum Saath Saath Hai' moment gives UDF a timely lift before Kerala polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-shashi-tharoor-congress-hum-saath-saath-hai-moment-gives-udf-a-timely-lift-before-kerala-polls/articleshow/128032640.cms,"'No Rebellion, No Ambition': Shashi Tharoor Sends Unity Signal After Meeting Rahul Gandhi, Kharge

'All is good' at a critical moment

Tharoor’s voter magnetism

Countering LDF and BJP narratives

Risks contained, momentum regained

NEW DELHI: The recent patch-up and the 'all is good' moment between Shashi Tharoor and the Congress high command have given the Congress in Kerala much-needed momentum ahead of the April–May assembly elections. Tharoor's meeting with Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi, after weeks of speculations about his strained ties with the party, has ended what many within the Congress described as an ""awkward episode"" and positioned him as a central campaign face for the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF).At a time when the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) is battling incumbency fatigue and the BJP is testing the limits of its expansion in the state, the reconciliation gives the UDF a renewed sense of coherence and momentum.Also read | Congress vs Tharoor: A new beginning or temporary truce? The recent Tharoor–Congress thaw sends a strong signal of unity to cadres and allies alike at a crucial time. Tharoor reportedly had been upset over the treatment meted out to him by Rahul Gandhi at a Kochi event recently and attempts by some leaders to sideline him in Kerala.For a party often in crisis over factionalism in its state units, the optics in Kerala were damaging.The reconciliation addressed that head-on. The leader of the opposition in the assembly, VD Satheesan's faction, and leaders seen as sympathetic to Tharoor now have little room for parallel power centres.The warmth also saves Congress from embarrassment in front of its own LDF allies.Last year, as Tharoor had pointed out, ""absence of a leader"" in the Kerala party unit, Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) chief Sadiq Ali Thangal had publicly asked the Congress to resolve internal differences, warning that visible discord would only benefit rivals.By bringing Tharoor back in confidence, that concern has now been allayed.This unity boost matters electorally.Since the late 1980s, Kerala voters have flipped governments every five years between the UDF and the LDF. However, this changed in the 2021 assembly polls, when the LDF failed to make gains and the LDF under Pinarayi Vijayan won a second consecutive term.The LDF improved its tally from 91 seats in 2016 to 99 in 2021, while the UDF dropped from 47 to 41 seats.In the 2021 assembly polls, the biggest drive for the LDF sweep came from the Travancore belt, which includes Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta and Kottayam. The LDF won a majority of seats in Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam, traditionally swing-heavy areas.Tharoor's Lok Sabha seat, Thiruvananthapuram, had also historically been a swing constituency, alternating between the Congress and the Left, and more recently becoming a BJP target seat. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP fielded Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar against Tharoor, but the Congress leader retained the seat for the fourth time by over 16,000 votes. The UDF swept 18 of 20 Lok Sabha seats.Tharoor’s appeal has been particularly visible among educated, salaried and first-time voters, segments that have shown increasing volatility in recent state and local elections. This cohort has not consistently aligned with the Congress organisation and has, at times, been receptive to the BJP’s urban outreach or the LDF’s governance pitch. Tharoor’s sustained wins in Thiruvananthapuram suggest an ability to arrest that drift, even when broader party trends are mixed.At a strategic level, this gives the UDF a pathway to expand beyond its traditional social bases without alienating them. Urban centres such as Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Kozhikode, where turnout fluctuates and margins are often narrow, are likely to play an outsized role in 2026. Tharoor’s presence allows the Congress to contest these spaces more credibly, particularly at a time when the BJP has signalled intent through incremental municipal gains and a recent mayoral victory.The Congress leadership’s decision to deploy Tharoor as a campaign spearhead, tasked with touring all 140 constituencies, adds star power to a contest that often hinges on narrative dominance. Tharoor’s oratory, media presence and ability to frame local issues within a national and global context give the UDF an edge in reaching undecided voters.The patch-up blunts rival narratives at once. For the BJP, which has repeatedly highlighted Congress infighting to project itself as a disciplined alternative (recently by also using Tharoor's name frequently), the reconciliation weakens the ""internal chaos"" line of attack.This comes at a moment when the BJP is seeking to capitalise on its recent mayoral win in Thiruvananthapuram municipal corporation, a symbolic breakthrough that signalled growing urban traction, even if assembly-level success remains elusive.Moreover, Tharoor's active presence on the campaign trail is likely to help the UDF attract the younger demographic, especially aspirants and educated youth. The Congress leader's credibility as an author, diplomat and global speaker also gives him unique traction among voters in Kerala, given the state's high literacy rate.Both the LDF and the BJP-led NDA have also often portrayed the Congress as dynastic and directionless. The image of Tharoor standing alongside Rahul Gandhi will undercut those claims, at least for now.Perhaps the most immediate benefit of the reconciliation is risk mitigation. Speculation that Tharoor might drift towards the LDF or even explore non-Congress platforms has been firmly quashed. His integration into the Congress election campaign gives a message of consistency.The memory of 2021 still looms large for Congress strategists. Despite favourable anti-incumbency indicators then, the UDF failed to convert opportunity into victory. The Tharoor patch-up is being seen as a corrective step, aimed at ensuring that organisational weaknesses do not once again squander political openings.By restoring unity, the Congress-Tharoor patch-up gives the opposition UDF a credible shot at turning the page after years of Left rule. Whether it translates into seats in elections will depend on execution, alliances and local dynamics, but for now with this 'Hum Saath Saath Hai' image, the UDF has scored an early and much-needed win before heading into the elections.","Shashi Tharoor's meeting with Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi has ended what many within the Congress described as an ""awkward episode"" The reconciliation gives the UDF a renewed sense of coherence and momentum. The warmth also saves Congress from embarrassment in front of its own LDF allies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128032858,imgsize-1130204,width-400,resizemode-4/128032858.jpg"

GHAZIABAD: Three sisters, aged 16, 14 and 12, were found dead in the early hours of Wednesday after falling from the ninth floor of their apartment building in Ghaziabad, near Delhi.The girls were discovered lying next to each other on the premises of Bharat City residential complex, directly below a bedroom window of their flat. Police say all three died on the spot.A resident of the complex, Arun Kumar, told local media he witnessed the incident at around 2am while standing on his balcony in another tower.Also read: Inside the troubled Ghaziabad home: 2 marriages, wives leaving, no schooling for kids, mounting debts and more He said the eldest girl was seated on the window ledge with her back facing the compound, while the two younger girls stood in front of her, holding her tightly.“Suddenly, the girl on the window leaned back and fell. Within seconds, the other two jumped,” Kumar said. He added that he ran downstairs and repeatedly called for an ambulance, which arrived at around 3.15am.Police took the girls to hospital, where doctors declared them dead on arrival.1.45 am2.00 am3.15 amLater in the day‘Didn’t go to school, were lonely’According to investigators, the three sisters were sleeping with their mother in one room of the flat, while their father, Chetan Kumar , slept in another room with their son.“At around 1.45am, the girls woke up on the pretext of getting water,” said Nimish Patil, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Trans-Hindon). “They went instead to the puja room and locked it from inside.”Police say the girls used a plastic stool to climb up to the window. Their mother woke up and knocked on the door, asking them to open it, but received no response.Also read: ‘You made Devu like Bollywood’: Did rift over youngest sibling push 3 Korea-obsessed Ghaziabad sisters to brink? Patil said that, according to the father’s statement, when he later woke up, he found the eldest daughter lying in the compound below. The two younger girls also jumped shortly after.A police field unit later broke open the puja room door. Inside, officers found childhood photographs of the three sisters scattered across the floor, along with a mobile phone and a pocket-sized diary.Police said the girls had taken their mother’s mobile phone before entering the puja room. The phone has been sent for forensic examination.A one-page handwritten note addressed to their father was also recovered. The note contained an apology — “Sorry Papa” — and urged him to read their diary, with the words “READ NOW” written in capital letters.Police and family members say the diary offers insight into the girls’ state of mind.According to officers familiar with the investigation, the diary reveals a deep attachment to Korean popular culture, including K-pop music, television dramas and what is known as BL (boy love) content. The girls wrote that Korea had become central to their lives and expressed anger towards their father for opposing their interest.“How did you even dare to take this from us?” reads one line in the diary.Police sources say this may refer to an incident around 15 days earlier, when Kumar allegedly took away the elder daughter’s mobile phone and sold it.Police also said this could be a reference to their father Chetan Kumar, a stock trader allegedly deep in debt , taking away the elder daughter’s phone 15 days ago and selling it.He has not denied the girls’ interest in Korean culture. “They listened to Korean music, watched Korean films, dramas, web series and cartoons. They also wanted to go to Korea,” he said. “All three wanted us to accept Korean culture, but when we refused, their behaviour changed. They went into a shell and lived in their own world.”Investigators say the girls had not attended school since the Covid-19 pandemic and were not being homeschooled. They also did not play with other children in the housing society.Writings found on the wall of their room point to a sense of isolation. Phrases such as “I am very, very alone”, “My life is very very alone” and “Make me a heart of broken” were scribbled on the wall.According to police, the sisters spent nearly all their time together and appeared to have withdrawn from social life. In their diary, they referred to each other by names borrowed from television shows — Maria , Aliza and Cindy — and appeared to see themselves as living in a separate world.The diary lists 19 things the girls said their parents disapproved of, including Korean dramas and music, as well as Chinese, Japanese, Thai, American and British entertainment. They also mentioned cartoons such as Shin-chan and Doraemon, and several mobile games.“You don’t know how much we loved Korea,” the girls wrote. “The way we loved Korean actors and K-pop groups, we didn’t even love family members that much.”The diary also refers to tensions within the family involving a younger sibling, a four-year-old girl referred to as “Devu”.The sisters wrote that they wanted to introduce Devu to their interests, but that their parents objected and instead encouraged her to watch Bollywood films. This, they wrote, caused further distress.“You made her Bollywood, which we hated more than life itself,” the diary reads.There are also references to physical punishment, although it is unclear who the girls were referring to. “Did we live in this world to get beaten by you?” one line reads. “Death would be better for us than beatings.”Another passage mentions marriage, without detail. “The mention of marriage caused tension in our hearts,” the diary says.Police believe the diary may have been written by the 14-year-old sister and estimate it was penned one or two days before the incident, possibly after an argument with their father. It has been sent for forensic analysis.Police say the family’s circumstances were complex. Kumar lives with three women who are sisters and claims to have married all of them. The eldest of the three girls who died and a younger boy are from his first wife. The two younger girls who died were born to her younger sister. The four-year-old girl mentioned in the diary is the child of the youngest sister.Officers say two of Kumar’s partners left the house in May 2025, prompting him to file missing persons reports. They returned a few days later.Investigators say Kumar suffered financial losses during the Covid-19 period and took loans thereafter, adding to stress within the household.Police say there were frequent arguments in the family over the girls’ interests and lifestyle. No foul play has been suspected so far, but officers say the investigation is ongoing and forensic reports are awaited.“This is a tragic case involving children and a family under severe emotional and financial stress,” Patil said.","Three sisters, aged 16, 14 and 12, were found dead in the early hours of Wednesday after falling from the ninth floor of their apartment building in Ghaziabad, near Delhi.

‘Complex Situation’: Brandi Carlile Turns ‘America the Beautiful’ Into a Super Bowl Prayer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/complex-situation-brandi-carlile-turns-america-the-beautiful-into-a-super-bowl-prayer/articleshow/128035413.cms,"Brandi Carlile will perform “America the Beautiful” before Super Bowl LX between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots at Levi’s Stadium.

Brandi Carlile wants ‘America the Beautiful’ to sound like where the country needs to go



Joni Mitchell jokes, daughters, and why there are no bananas on Brandi Carlile’s boat



On Feb. 8, 2026, Super Bowl LX will kick off at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, with the Seattle Seahawks facing the New England Patriots under a global spotlight. Before the ball is in the air, Brandi Carlile will step up to sing “America the Beautiful” on NBC and Peacock, in front of more than 100 million people.For Carlile, an 11-time Grammy winner and gay woman who has built a career around activism and storytelling, this is not just another prestige booking. She has already called the moment “a complex situation” and says the song feels like “a hope, a prayer, a belief than a celebration.” That is the energy she is bringing to the NFL’s biggest night.Carlile has sat with this song. She told The Globe and Mail that listening to Ray Charles and Whitney Houston sing it makes it feel forward-looking, not smug. “Listening to Ray Charles and Whitney Houston sing it, it sounds like a belief about where America’s going instead of a brag about where it is, or where it’s been.”Digging into the history shifted everything for her. The lyrics started as an 1895 poem by Katharine Lee Bates, a Wellesley College professor and feminist writer many scholars believe was gay. Carlile said, “When I learned the woman who wrote it was a lesbian, and why she wrote it, it started to feel more like a hope, a prayer, a belief than a celebration.I can’t lean into celebration right now, but I can lean into where we need to get to. ”In a separate interview with The Seattle Times, she did not pretend the platform is simple. “Well, it’s a complex situation. This stage alone is a complex situation, if you’re paying attention.” At a time when the Constitution is being tested and even the halftime choice of Bad Bunny has become a culture-war talking point, Carlile is trying to pull attention back to the writer, the lesser-known verses, and the people the song has often ignored.“‘America the Beautiful’ is one of the finest pieces of music and lyrics … that this country has ever seen,” she said, adding that she feels proud the league asked a gay woman to sing it on that stage. “If we can draw as many people as possible to that original poem and the woman that wrote it, it’ll be a really interesting perspective on America. I’m really excited to get to sing that song on such an important stage as a person from a marginalized community. ”Away from the Super Bowl machine, Carlile keeps her circle small and a little chaotic in the best way. In that same Globe and Mail Q&A, she talked about nights with Joni Mitchell that feel more like sleepovers than museum pieces.“She’s formidable, but she’s also light on her feet. She has this helium balloon laugh that could peel paint.”Carlile laughed about Mitchell clowning modern stars. “She does laugh at the way we dance, the way we dress, and she does not care who hears it.” In Vegas during the Grammys, Mitchell wanted to play blackjack but refused to bet more than $10, forcing the house to drop the table to $5. That is the energy in Carlile’s orbit: legends, but in sweatpants and inside jokes.At home in Washington with her wife Catherine and their two daughters, the conversations are about displaced people, refugees, and faith that is separate from the state. The kids see both versions of her. They prefer what she calls “pipe jig mom,” the one in a fun shirt and baseball cap, not Gucci on stage, because they do not have to share that version with an arena.When the tour is over, she will go right back to the border of British Columbia with a halibut rod in hand. She listed off copper jigs, treble hooks, a Shimano Ugly Stik, and one hard rule: “You cannot have bananas on a boat. It’s terrible luck.”On Sunday, all of that walks out with her: the fan who teases Joni Mitchell, the mom talking about migrants at the dinner table, the angler banning bananas, the gay woman trying to turn a patriotic standard into a prayer. The job is simple and impossible at once: make one minute and 40 seconds feel honest enough that people hear the song differently when the ball finally kicks off.","Brandi Carlile will sing ‘America the Beautiful’ before Super Bowl LX.

T20 World Cup Groups Explained: Who Can Reach the Super 8

Including Rohit and Virat, there are 11 players

Jemimah promoted to A category contract

The list of men’s contracts for 2025-26

List of Women players for 2025-26 contracts

MUMBAI: India's premier pacer Jasprit Bumrah, ODI and Test skipper Shubman Gill and veteran allrounder Ravindra Jadeja are the only three players who will be given Grade A central contracts for 2025-26 by the BCCI , while former captains Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , who play only the ODI format now, have been kept in the 'B' category, TOI has exclusively learnt. Kohli and Rohit are both modern-day legends and were in the A+ category earlier, but have been moved to the B category as they now play only one out of three formats.Overall, 30 Indian players will be given the BCCI central contracts for the 2025-26 season, as per the recommendations of the national selectors. The Board is expected to officially announce the list of contracted players soon.Bumrah, India's premier pacer across formats and team's strike bowler, was in the A+ category, and so was Jadeja. For Gill, being retained in the A category of central contracts is a major source of relief after being dropped from India's T20 squad just ahead of the 2026 T20 World Cup at home. Like Kohli and Rohit, Jadeja has retired from T20Is, but he still features in Tests and ODIs, where he has been in poor form of late.TOI had reported in its Jan 21 edition that BCCI was set to make a major overhaul in its Annual Central Contracts system, with sweeping changes that could significantly reshape the hierarchy of Indian cricket’s elite players, for the 2025-26 season.The Ajit Agarkar-led national selection committee had proposed doing away with the prestigious Grade A+ category, which was introduced back in 2018 altogether, a move that directly impacted senior stalwarts Kohli and Rohit.Who will be given Grade ‘B’ central contracts by the BCCI. The others in this category are: Off-spinning allrounder Washington Sundar, Test opener and ODI 'keeper-batter KL Rahul, senior pacer Mohammed Siraj, white-ball allrounder Hardik Pandya , India's Test vice-captain Rishabh Pant, Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav, India's Test and ODI opener Yashasvi Jaiswal, India's T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav, and ODI middle-order batter Shreyas Iyer.Grade C contracts will be given to 16 players-Axar Patel, Tilak Varma, Rinku Singh, Shivam Dube, Sanju Samson, Arshdeep Singh, Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep, Dhruv Jurel, Harshit Rana, Varun Chakravarthy, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Abhishek Sharma, Sai Sudarshan, Ravi Bishnoi and Ruturaj Gaikwad.Meanwhile, in the case of the Indian women’s team, the biggest gainer in the case of annual retainership for 2025-26 is India’s 2025 World Cup semifinal hero Jemimah Rodrigues, who has been promoted to the A category, where she joins skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, vice-captain Smriti Mandhana and ace allrounder Deepti Sharma.Rodrigues, who captained Delhi Capitals to the final in the recently-concluded Women’s Premier League, had slammed brilliant 127 not out off 134 balls to fashion a stunning five-wicket win over Australia in the semifinal of the 2025 Women’s ODI World Cup in Oct-Nov last year at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai.Before that game, the Mumbai batter had smashed 76 not out off 55 balls against New Zealand to contribute to India’s win in a do-or-die game for them at the same venue.Grade A: Jasprit Bumrah, Shubman Gill and Ravindra Jadeja.Grade B: Washington Sundar, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Mohammed Siraj, Hardik Pandya, Rishabh Pant, Kuldeep Yadav, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Suryakumar Yadav, Shreyas Iyer.Grade C: Axar Patel, Tilak Varma, Rinku Singh, Shivam Dube, Sanju Samson, Arshdeep Singh, Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep, Dhruv Jurel, Harshit Rana, Varun Chakravarthy, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Abhishek Sharma, Sai Sudarshan, Ravi Bishnoi, Ruturaj Gaikwad.Grade A: Harmanpreet Kaur, Smriti Mandhana, Jemimah Rodrigues, Deepti Sharma.Grade B: Renuka Thakur, Shafali Verma, Richa Ghosh, Sneh Rana.Grade C: Radha Yadav, Amanjot Kaur, Pratika Rawal, Kranti Gaud, Uma Chhetri (wk), Arundhati Reddy, Shree Charini, Yastika Bhatia, Harleen Deol, Kashvi Gautam, G Kamlini (wk), Vaishnavi Sharma, Tejal Hasbnis.","India's premier pacer Jasprit Bumrah, ODI and Test skipper Shubman Gill and veteran allrounder Ravindra Jadeja are the only three players who will be given Grade A central contracts for 2025-26.

How Terrance Gore’s speed helped the Kansas City Royals win big moments

Terrance Gore, the Kansas City Royals player known for game-changing speed, has died at the age of 34. The team confirmed the news on Friday, February 6. His wife, Britney Gore, shared on social media that he died after problems during what was meant to be a routine surgery. Gore leaves behind his wife and their three children. While many players are remembered for home runs or big hits, Gore built his career in a very different way. He made his mark with speed alone. When he reached base, fans stood up because something exciting was about to happen.Even before he recorded his first major league hit, he was helping teams win games in big moments. Terrance Gore spent parts of eight seasons in Major League Baseball. The Kansas City Royals team became his most recognized team when his leg power helped him win tight matches, which ultimately led to the team's victory in the 2015 World Series. Teammates respected him, fans loved him, and wherever he played, his energy stood out. His impact went far beyond the stat sheet.Terrance Gore stood 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighed around 160 pounds, but his speed made him larger than life. He once ran the 40-yard dash in 4.29 seconds.The Royals used him mainly as a pinch runner, especially during their deep playoff runs in 2014 and 2015.Gore began his career by stealing 17 bases without being caught. Pitchers rushed. Catchers panicked. Fans held their breath. During the Royals’ 2015 championship season, his speed helped turn tight games in their favor. He became a fan favorite in Kansas City, even though he had not yet recorded a major league hit.That first hit finally came in 2018 with the Chicago Cubs, a single up the middle off Max Scherzer. Gore later returned to the Royals in 2019 and showed growth as a hitter, batting .275 with 14 hits and stealing 13 bases.He also played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Atlanta Braves, and New York Mets. In 2021, he appeared in the National League Division Series with Atlanta. When the Braves later won the World Series, Gore made a video call to injured pitcher Charlie Morton so he could feel part of the celebration.

Travis Kelce celebrates Super Bowl week with music, style, and a Swift-inspired moment

Super Bowl week is always loud, busy, and full of late nights. Travis Kelce made sure his week followed the same vibe. Even without Taylor Swift by his side, her presence still filled the room. At a party in the Bay Area, the Kansas City Chiefs star was spotted smiling, dancing, and clearly enjoying himself as one of Swift’s most famous songs played from the DJ booth.Kelce had earlier attended the NFL Honors ceremony, where he was nominated for the Walter Payton Man of the Year award. He did not win, but that did not slow him down. A few hours later, he showed up relaxed and upbeat at the “Tight Ends and Friends” party. Phones were out. Music was loud. And Kelce looked like someone who was ready to enjoy the moment.A short video shared by the New Heights podcast X account showed Travis Kelce standing between DJs Andrew Fedyk and Joe De Pace, known together as Loud Luxury.The timing felt intentional. As soon as Kelce settled in near the booth, the DJs played a mashup that blended You Belong With Me by Taylor Swift with We Found Love, produced by Calvin Harris.The crowd reacted instantly, and Kelce leaned into the moment rather than stepping back.Kelce did not stay quiet or reserved. He clapped, moved with the beat, and helped keep the energy up around the stage.At one point, he pulled out his phone and recorded the scene himself, smiling as the music played. It felt less like a publicity moment and more like something he wanted to remember later.When the DJs switched to “The Fate of Ophelia,” Kelce stayed right there, nodding along and soaking in the atmosphere instead of heading back into the crowd.Earlier that evening, Kelce had already made headlines at the NFL Honors ceremony. He arrived wearing a bold suit paired with sunglasses, a look that quickly stood out among the more traditional outfits.That same confidence carried into the party later, where his mood stayed light and relaxed. According to TMZ Sports, Kelce has been out and about in the Bay Area throughout the week.The outlet spoke with him at his own event on Wednesday, where he joked about how much Garage Beer he expects to have at his wedding reception.As of Friday, Swift had not been spotted in the city, but with Super Bowl weekend still unfolding, fans continue to watch closely.","Travis Kelce was spotted dancing to Taylor Swift's You Belong With Me at a party in the Bay Area.

Terrance Gore built his MLB career on speed, World Series moments, and a rare role teams trusted

Terrance Gore, one of baseball’s fastest and most trusted late-game runners, passed away on February 6, 2026. He was 34 years old. His wife confirmed that he died due to complications from a routine medical procedure. The news shocked the baseball world because Gore was still closely tied to the game and widely respected for doing one job better than almost anyone else, running when it mattered most.Gore never looked like a typical Major League Baseball player on paper. He did not hit much, and he did not play every day. But when games were close and pressure was high, teams wanted him on the field. His speed changed outcomes. That skill helped him win three World Series rings with three different teams, the Kansas City Royals in 2015, the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2020, and the Atlanta Braves in 2021. Very few players can say that.Money was never the headline of Gore’s career, but he still built a solid life through baseball. By 2026, his estimated net worth was about $2.5 million. That number came from his Major League salaries, postseason shares, signing bonuses, and smaller appearance or endorsement deals over eight seasons. His net worth grew slowly but steadily, starting around $1.51 million in 2022 and rising each year as he stayed valuable to winning teams.Terrance Gore played parts of eight MLB seasons with the Kansas City Royals, Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers, Atlanta Braves, and New York Mets. Teams did not sign him for home runs. They signed him because one stolen base could change a season.His income mainly came from MLB contracts and postseason bonuses. Players on championship teams receive World Series shares, and Gore earned those three times. Even when he moved between rosters or spent time in the minors, teams kept him close because his skill was needed in October.In the modern baseball era, where numbers guide decisions, Terrance Gore proved that one elite skill still matters. He ran with purpose. He stole bases under pressure. And when the moment came, managers trusted him without hesitation.","Terrance Gore was one of baseball's fastest and most trusted late-game runners.

Boston Celtics strengthen roster with strategic Nikola Vucevic trade from Chicago Bulls

Nikola Vucevic brings experience and double-double power to Boston Celtics frontcourt

During this year's NBA trade deadline, the Boston Celtics traded a number of players, but they have also added a significant player in center. Nikola Vucevic, who will miss Wednesday's game against the Houston Rockets, has joined the team. The Bulls traded him to the Celtics, who then traded Anfernee Simons from the Celtics.The Celtics made three small trades before the 3 p.m. game after obtaining big man Nikola Vucevic and a second-round pick from the Chicago Bulls in exchange for guard Anfernee Simons. They have also sent Xavier Tillman to the Charlotte Hornets, Josh Minott to the Brooklyn Nets, and Chris Boucher to the Utah Jazz.After acquiring center Nikola Vucevic from the Chicago Bulls in exchange for guard Anfernee Simons, the Boston Celtics have added some depth to their front line for the postseason run. The Celtics acquired the talented big one day before the trade deadline, giving him a change of scenery after six seasons with the Bulls.Boston's tax burden will drop significantly as a result of the shift, from approximately $39 million to $17 million. The Celtics also have additional financial flexibility as part of the transaction, which they may use to make other deals. However, despite his Tuesday trade from Chicago to Boston, Vucevic isn't nearly ready to make his Celtics debut.Moreover, there was no mention of Vucevic in Boston's injury report that Celtics reporter Noa Dalzell issued on Friday. The omission of his name suggests that he will make his Celtics debut on Friday.The seasoned center will probably replace Neemias Queta in the starting lineup after he becomes comfortable with his new squad. Vucevic will possibly have his next opportunity to play against Miami on Friday. After this deal, Boston was a little shorthanded during Wednesday's game, but the fans could see the Celtics' newest roster in action on Friday against the Heat.Vucevic, a 35-year-old in his 15th season, is one of the most reliable double-double machines when he arrives in Boston. Vucevic has averaged 18.5 points and 10.5 rebounds a game during the past ten campaigns, officially recording double-doubles in eight of them.Vucevic is now joining his fourth franchise after playing for the Bulls, Philadelphia, and Orlando. Similar to his career averages of 17.2 points and 10.4 rebounds per game, he has averaged 16.9 points and 9.0 rebounds this season.With Xavier Tillman Sr., Luka Garza, and Neemias Queta making up Boston's center rotation, Vucevic joined a frontline that was lacking in experience. He has played in 1,020 regular-season games and 16 playoff games, including 10 with the Orlando Magic in 2018-20.Additionally, he has been with Chicago for the past five and a half seasons. He is now moving to Boston, where he will start at center right away. In 48 games this season, Vucevic has averaged 16.9 points, 9.0 rebounds, and 3.8 assists.","Boston Celtics acquired center Nikola Vucevic from the Chicago Bulls in exchange for guard Anfernee Simons.

New Kids on the block opened the pop music door

Gloria Estefan changed the language of the halftime show

Prince set the gold standard in the rain

Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake changed tv forever

Kendrick Lamar and Rihanna redefined modern halftime shows

The Super Bowl halftime show has slowly turned into one of the biggest moments in global entertainment. While football remains the heart of the night, millions now watch just to see what happens during those 13 minutes on stage. As Super Bowl LX approaches with Bad Bunny set to perform, it is worth looking back at the moments that shaped how halftime shows are viewed today. These performances were not just concerts. They changed rules, broke records, and reflected culture in real time.For many years, halftime shows were led by marching bands and safe performances. That pattern broke in 1991 when New Kids on the Block became the first major pop act to headline.The show included a children’s choir and songs aimed at a family audience. It was not widely praised, but it mattered.Donnie Wahlberg later told Playboy, “I don’t know how much pride I take in the actual performance. But I take pride in the fact that we were the first ones to do it.”In 1999, Gloria Estefan made history by becoming the first Spanish-language artist to headline a Super Bowl halftime show.According to ESPN, her Miami performance blended English and Spanish and reflected the city’s culture.Years later, speaking to E! News, Estefan advised Bad Bunny ahead of his halftime moment, saying, “Enjoy every second because it really goes by so fast.”Many critics still point to Prince's 2007 as the greatest halftime show ever. Performing during heavy rain, Prince closed with “Purple Rain,” creating a moment that felt unplanned and unforgettable. The Athletic later wrote that no performer before or after has matched the impact of that night.Not every moment brought praise. In 2004, Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake were involved in a wardrobe malfunction watched by more than 140 million viewers, according to The Guardian. The incident led to stricter broadcast rules and changed how live TV was handled for years.In 2025, Kendrick Lamar delivered the most-watched halftime show ever, with 133.5 million viewers, according to Billboard.Two years earlier, Rihanna stunned fans by performing an entire set while pregnant, suspended above the field. BuzzFeed News praised the show for its calm confidence and control.","The Super Bowl halftime show has slowly turned into one of the biggest moments in global entertainment.

My Two Cents on this Mock Trade

Thelook ready to push for contention after an uneven 2025 season. Their offseason already includes a major move which was signing Pete Alonso to a five-year, $155 million contract but the club may not be done. Trade talk around the league suggests Baltimore is exploring a deal for Detroit Tigers left-hander Tarik Skubal.Nothing has been finalized as of February 2026, but several mock trades identify the Orioles as a strong fit. If a deal happens, it would impact both divisions and force each team to balance present needs with future plans.One commonly discussed proposal has Baltimore Orioles acquiring Tarik Skubal, 28, who is entering his final year before free agency. Detroit would receive outfielder Dylan Beavers, ranked No. 69 among MLB prospects, along with right-handers Trey Gibson and Luis Leon.Skubal delivered one of the best pitching seasons in baseball in 2025. He finished 13-6 with a 2.21 ERA, 241 strikeouts, a 0.891 WHIP, and 195 innings. His production has placed him among the game’s top starters.The Tigers are at least listening because of a large arbitration gap. Skubal filed for $32 million, while the team countered at $19 million.Moving him now would prevent the risk of losing him after 2026 without a return.Beavers, 24, hit .304/.420/.515 with 18 home runs in Triple-A last season. Gibson, ranked No. 46 among MLB prospects, profiles as a potential starter. Leon adds another young arm who could help the bullpen.Tarik Skubal would lead a rotation that already includes Trevor Rogers, Kyle Bradish, and Shane Baz. Rogers posted a 3.12 ERA with 198 strikeouts in 2025, Bradish recorded a 3.39 ERA with 178 strikeouts, and Baz finished with a 3.87 ERA and 162 strikeouts.Projections suggest the Orioles’ World Series odds could rise from about 10% to 25% with an ace. Alonso, who had 264 home runs, a .272 average, and an .871 OPS in 2025, strengthens a lineup that also features Adley Rutschman (28 home runs, 92 RBIs) and Gunnar Henderson (32 home runs, 103 RBIs).The risk is control. Skubal could leave after one season if the Orioles do not extend him, similar to what happened when Corbin Burnes departed.Trading Skubal would not necessarily signal a rebuild. Detroit remained competitive in 2025, with Skubal also posting a 10-11 record, a 3.11 ERA, and 223 strikeouts.Beavers could fill a corner outfield role, Gibson provides rotation depth, and Leon strengthens the pitching staff. The Tigers would also save roughly $13 million in arbitration, giving them more payroll flexibility as they plan ahead for 2027.• The Orioles add a top starter and could approach a 90-win projection.• The Tigers gain controllable prospects while staying competitive.• Skubal is positioned to command a free-agent contract that may reach $400 million.• Baltimore would reduce its farm depth.• Detroit would be trading a franchise-level pitcher.• The Orioles risk getting only one season from Skubal.Baltimore Orioles would benefit immediately if Skubal performs at his usual level. Detroit’s advantage would likely come later by adding younger players and lowering payroll pressure.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Cincinnati Reds predicted to land $10.2 million New York Yankees star slugger in hopes of improving rotation and title odds The trade remains speculative, but its impact would be significant for both teams and could influence the American League race in 2026.","The Baltimore Orioles signed first baseman Pete Alonso to a five-year, $155 million contract.

What this game means entering the All-Star stretch

The New York Knicks visit Little Caesars Arena on Friday with a chance to strengthen their position near the top of the Eastern Conference. They arrive with several injuries that could affect rotations and minutes against a Detroit team that has been steady for most of the season.The Pistons hold the conference’s best record at 37-13 and have been consistent on both ends of the floor. Their injury list is shorter, but a few decisions before tipoff could still influence the matchup. With the All-Star break approaching, both teams are focused on seeding and maintaining form.Karl-Anthony Towns is unlikely to play, which would remove one of New York’s primary scoring options. Jalen Brunson is expected to handle a larger share of the offense if Towns sits. OG Anunoby’s status matters on defense, especially against Detroit’s wings. Josh Hart is expected to play and should help with rebounding and ball movement.Jalen Duren’s availability is the main concern for Detroit. His presence helps protect the rim and control rebounds. Tobias Harris and Duncan Robinson are both expected to play, giving Detroit stability in the rotation.Recent meetings have often been close, with several games decided late.New York has maintained a positive scoring margin this season. Brunson leads the offense, while Mitchell Robinson provides interior defense. Mikal Bridges has been active on the perimeter. If Towns does not play and Anunoby is limited, New York will rely more on guard play and defensive discipline.Detroit scores efficiently and defends at a high level. The team rebounds well and protects the paint. If Duren plays, that interior defense becomes stronger.A win for Detroit would help maintain its lead in the conference. For New York, a road win against the top seed would reduce the gap and show it can compete despite injuries.The Knicks are likely to depend on Brunson, Hart, Bridges, and Robinson, along with whoever fills Towns’ minutes. Detroit will try to use its defense and rebounding to control the pace.

Chemistry between young stars helped Switzerland weather the early storm in the Olympics



The opening game of Switzerland's Olympic campaign required grit, resilience, and contributions from veterans and newcomers alike. When the moment demanded excellence, two established stars delivered while a new generation announced its arrival on the sport's biggest stage.Alina Muller and Lara Stalder shifted momentum throughout the Group A thriller against Czechia on Friday. The duo consistently created offensive chances and provided the spark Switzerland needed to erase a two-goal deficit in the final period, even helping their team secure the win.With an early goal from Kristyna Kaltounkova, Team Czechia seized the game in their favor early, but the Swiss didn’t allow the lead to continue for long. Just minutes later, Laura Zimmerman slapped the puck inside the net to level the game.But the Czechs soon turned the game in their favor as goals by Natalie Mlynkova and Tereza Plosova put their team ahead 3-1 with minutes remaining on the clock. While a victory looked unachievable, Switzerland refused to concede.Muller scored a power-play goal 10 minutes into the third period, orchestrating a tic-tac-toe sequence with Stalder and Ivana Wey that cut the deficit to one.Defender Lara Christen then rifled home the tying goal with less than three minutes remaining in regulation to force overtime.The Swiss controlled possession through the three-on-three overtime period before the game went to a shootout.

Chicago Bulls vs Toronto Raptors Betting and Game Outlook (February 5, 2026)

Theon Thursday in a meeting between two teams trying to stay competitive in the Eastern Conference playoff race. Neither side has found sustained form this season, and both are dealing with roster changes that have affected continuity.This is an important game in which Chicago will be playing after multiple trades and injuries decided the rotation. On the other hand, Toronto is managing its own absences. With several regular contributors unavailable, this matchup is likely to depend on how each team deals with absences and rotation fillers rather than star power.The Chicago Bulls are adjusting to a roster that looks very different from earlier in the season.• Zach Collins - Right first-toe sprain• Ayo Dosunmu - Not with team (trade-related)• Noa Essengue - Recovering from left-shoulder surgery• Josh Giddey - Left hamstring strain• Tre Jones - Left hamstring strain• Julian Phillips - Not with team (trade-related)• Dalen Terry - Not with team (trade-related)• Nikola Vucevic - Not with team (trade-related)• Ousmane Dieng - Trade pending• Collin Sexton - Trade pendingProbable / Expected to Play• Jaden Ivey - ProbableChicago is expected to rely more on younger guards, and the frontcourt depth is limited.Toronto Raptors is also dealing with availability issues, particularly in the paint.• RJ Barrett - Managed right-knee sprain• Jakob Poeltl - Lower-back strain• Chucky Hepburn - G League assignment• A.J. Lawson - G League assignment• Ayo Dosunmu - Bilateral quad-tendon issue• Tre Jones - Left hamstring strainWithout Barrett and Poeltl, Toronto loses a primary scorer on the wing and its main rim protector. That places more responsibility on the backcourt.• Chicago Bulls - 4 wins• Toronto Raptors - 0 winsChicago has won each matchup by an average of about 7.5 points and has outscored Toronto by roughly 15 points per 100 possessions.• Total games: 110• Bulls wins: 61• Raptors wins: 49Chicago is 24-27, placing 10th in the East and third in the Central Division.• Points per game: ~117.2• Field-goal percentage: ~47.3%• Three-point percentage: ~36.8%• Turnovers: ~14.4Ball movement remains a strength, but the absence of Nikola Vucevic and the injury to Josh Giddey have shifted more creation to the perimeter.• Points allowed: ~120.2• Rebounds: ~45.3 (3rd in NBA)• Net rating: about -3.0The Bulls rebound well but have struggled defensively, especially around the rim and on perimeter rotations.Toronto is close to the .500 mark with results largely driven by defense.• Points per game: mid-110s• Three-point shooting: roughly 34-35%• Assists: just over 28The offense relies on pick-and-roll sets and transition scoring, but outside shooting and turnovers have limited efficiency.• Points allowed per 100 possessions: around 113-114• Net rating: slightly positiveToronto defends the perimeter effectively, though Poeltl’s absence reduces interior protection.With Giddey, Jones, and Collins out, Chicago will depend on Jaden Ivey and its remaining ball-handlers to attack the defense and create second-chance opportunities. The Bulls’ rebounding advantage could matter against a smaller Toronto lineup.Toronto is likely to push the pace and force contested shots. Defensive communication and help coverage will be important without a traditional interior anchor.Rebounding and second-chance points favor Chicago, while Toronto may attempt more three-pointers despite a lower percentage. Based on the season series and current injuries, the spread is expected to lean slightly toward the Bulls.Both teams enter the game dealing with lineup changes and missing players. Chicago has controlled the season series, but Toronto’s defense has kept games competitive. The result may come down to which team handles the rotation gaps more effectively and executes late in the game.","Chicago Bulls host Toronto Raptors on February 5, 2026.

How a single vote cost Drake Maye the NFL MVP to Matthew Stafford,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/how-a-single-vote-cost-drake-maye-the-nfl-mvp-to-matthew-stafford/articleshow/128007901.cms,"Matthew Stafford (Getty Images)

Stafford’s MVP Win Defined by Heartfelt ""MVD"" Tribute from His Four Daughters

""To my four beautiful daughters... you guys are my 'why',""

The 5-Point Controversy: Was Drake Maye Robbed?

The ""Sam Monson"" Factor:

Value vs. Volume: Stafford had the ""volume"" (46 TDs), but Maye had the ""value,"" leading a rebuilding Patriots team to a 14-3 record with a significantly weaker supporting cast.

Efficiency: Maye led the league in completion percentage (72%) and passer rating (113.5).



The ""Super Bowl"" Irony: Fans were quick to point out that while Stafford was accepting a trophy, Maye was busy preparing to play in Super Bowl LX this Sunday.



Public and Celebrity Reaction: A Split Decision

The Legends: Tom Brady and Steve Young have been vocal in their support of Stafford, calling it a ""lifetime achievement"" win for a veteran who has finally earned his flowers.



The New Guard: Younger fans and analysts argue that the MVP award should go to the ""best player that year,"" not the player with the best story.

The Meme Wars: Today, February 7th, is Stafford's 38th birthday. Memes are already circulating of him ""stealing"" the trophy as a birthday gift from the voters.

On Thursday night at the NFL Honors, the league crowned Matthew Stafford as the MVP. But while the history books will record the 37-year-old Rams quarterback as the 2025 NFL MVP, the night was defined by a razor-thin voting margin and a surprise video that reminded everyone why he’s really playing.Before Stafford took the stage to accept his trophy, the room went quiet for a surprise video. In a clip that has since racked up millions of views, Stafford’s four daughters—Chandler, Sawyer, Hunter, and Tyler surprised their dad with a homemade tribute.They didn't talk about his league-leading 4,707 passing yards or his 46 touchdowns. Instead, they crowned him their ""MVD""—Most Valuable Dad. Stafford was visibly moved to tears, and when he finally took the stage, he was flanked by his daughters and his wife, Kelly.Stafford told the crowd. He then used the massive platform to put retirement rumors to bed, confirming he will return for the 2026 season.Despite the sentimental celebration, a storm was brewing on social media. Stafford won the award by just 5 points (366 to 361), the closest margin in 22 years.The debate centers on a single vote. Analyst Sam Monson revealed he used his first-place vote on Justin Herbert (who wasn't even a top-5 finalist).Because Maye lost by only 5 points, that one ""renegade"" vote effectively decided the race.Patriots fans and ""advanced stats"" enthusiasts are calling it a robbery, citing the following:The reaction has been a perfect reflection of the close vote:Matthew Stafford goes into the 2026 season with a Hall of Fame lock, an MVP trophy, and a title he clearly values more: Most Valuable Dad. But for Drake Maye, the 5-point snub might just be the fuel he needs to go from ""Runner-Up"" to ""Super Bowl Champion"" this Sunday.","Matthew Stafford was crowned the 2025 NFL MVP on Thursday night.

It is learnt that the two parties have already exchanged emails in the last few days.The PCB has invoked Force Majeure citing the government instruction to not take the field versus their arch-rivals in the group stage of the multi-nation tournament. In the statement, the government didn't give any further explanation or justification for doing the same. In response, cricket 's global body has asked the PCB to justify how it tried to get out of the logjam as per the Terms of Participation.""Yes the PCB has invoked the Force Majeure but didn't give any further explanation or details. The ICC in response has asked the Pakistan board to demonstrate what it had done to mitigate FM,"" says a source tracking developments.Additionally, the conditions under which Force Majeure can be invoked were laid out by the ICC in its detailed response and stressed on the need of evidentiary threshold required for non-participation.The ICC has also highlighted the sporting, commercial and governance implications because of non-participation.With 8 days to the marquee clash, the ICC has kept the channels of dialogue open.

While the PCB has yet to make a public statement on the matter, the team maintains that it will follow the government’s advice.“The India game, it’s not in our control. It’s a government decision, and we respect that. Whatever they are going to say, we do that,” Pakistan captain Salman Agha said during the captains’ conference.India captain Suryakumar Yadav, however, had a different take and said India will travel to Colombo as per plan and already have their tickets booked for the fixture.“Mindset is pretty clear,” Suryakumar said at the captains’ media briefing on Thursday in Mumbai. “We did not refuse to play them. The refusal came from them. ICC organised the fixture. BCCI and the Indian government decided to play at a neutral venue in coordination with ICC. Our flight to Colombo is booked. So we are going. We’ll see what happens later.”It now remains to be seen what happens to the fixture, but the two parties are engaged in dialogue and the next few days could provide some much-needed clarity.", dialogue between Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the International Cricket Council (ICC) after Pakistan government's decision to boycott T20 World Cup fixture against India.

Travis Kelce loses major NFL honor as retirement rumors keep swirling around Chiefs star,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-kelce-loses-major-nfl-honor-as-retirement-rumors-keep-swirling-around-chiefs-star/articleshow/127989106.cms,"Travis Kelce (via Getty Images)

Why this award matters, and what Kelce’s silence could mean for Kansas City

The retirement rumors around Travis Kelce continue to swirl in addition to the excitement about his marriage to Taylor Swift. However, fans will be disappointed with how the tight end failed to win a prestigious award recently. The NFL officially announced one of its biggest yearly awards, where Kelce was selected by his team as its nominee for the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award, a recognition that carries real weight across the league.But when NFL Honors took center stage on Thursday, February 5, the award went to Washington Commanders linebacker Bobby Wagner instead. For Kelce and millions of his fans, it was a tough moment, especially for those still waiting and uncertain about his decision on whether he will return for another season.The Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award is not a typical trophy, as it is one of the league’s most respected honors because it recognizes both football excellence and impact away from the field. The award has been around since 1970 and is given to a player who stands out for leadership, charity work, and community service.According to the NFL, the winner receives “up to a $250,000 donation to the charity of his choice.”The league also supports every team nominee, with all 32 club winners receiving “up to a $40,000 donation to their charity of choice.” That support is a big reason why being nominated alone is considered a meaningful achievement.This year, the honor went to Wagner, a longtime leader and one of the most respected veterans in the sport. His acceptance speech was emotional and personal. Praising his dad, Bobby Sr., Wagner said, “I didn’t realize how hard it was to be a father until I got two kids of my own.” He also gave heartfelt credit to his mother, calling her “my rock,” and adding, “She’s the reason why I’m standing up here.”For Kelce, the timing is what makes this disappointing news hit harder. The Chiefs star has been linked to retirement talk for weeks, and he has not shut it down with a clear statement. On the January 7 episode of the New Heights podcast, Kelce explained his mindset to his brother and co-host, Jason Kelce. He stated that he plans on “just being a regular human for a couple weeks, maybe a month or so,” and then will try to figure out what he is going to do next in terms of his future in football.","Travis Kelce was nominated for the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award.

Seth Jarvis of the Carolina Hurricanes replaces Brayden Point of the Tampa Bay Lightning



After worrying about Tampa Bay Lightning forward Brayden Point's injuries, Team Canada's plans for the 2026 Winter Olympics have changed a lot. As officials worked to finalize the roster before the tournament, Carolina Hurricanes forward Seth Jarvis got the call that would put him on one of the biggest stages in international hockey.Fans and analysts had a lot to say about the decision on NHL updates. They talked about how Jarvis' selection affected them emotionally and what it meant for the team to lose a key player like Point. With the tournament coming up soon, Hockey Canada focused on adding a forward who could be fast, adaptable, and consistently good at scoring goals.Seth Jarvis apparently found out he had been picked during a pre-game routine, which made the moment even more special for the young Carolina Hurricanes forward.

He has continued to grow into a reliable player, which probably helped Team Canada make their choice.Team Canada is missing a big player in Brayden Point. The Tampa Bay Lightning center has always been a reliable player on both offense and defense, and his experience in high-pressure games would have made him a great leader. However, management had to look for other options that could keep the competitive balance because of ongoing injury updates.There was talk in NHL news circles about Connor Bedard, a forward for the Chicago Blackhawks, possibly taking over the role.From the point of view of an NHL match preview, Jarvis's addition makes both Team Canada's chances at the Olympics and the Carolina Hurricanes' upcoming NHL match today more interesting.

The Benito Break: Mike Vrabel Paused Practice for a 14-Minute Bad Bunny Concert

It might sound like a prank, but it’s actually a brilliant piece of psychological warfare. On Friday, New England Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel made headlines for one of the most unique practice drills in Super Bowl history. And if you really think about it, it’s actually pretty smart.Exactly one hour into the Patriots’ final full practice at Stanford Stadium, Vrabel blew his whistle and did something players didn't expect: he ordered the entire team off the field.For the next 14 minutes, the players were made to sit in the locker room while Bad Bunny’s discography blared at max volume over the stadium’s PA system. This wasn't a dance break, it was a calculated simulation of the ""Super Bowl Lag.""Vrabel, who won three Super Bowls as a player under Bill Belichick, knows that the biggest enemy in the Big Game isn't just the opponent, it's the timing.In a regular game, halftime is about 12 minutes. Players barely have time to catch their breath before they are back on the field.Between the massive stage setup, the performance by a global superstar like Bad Bunny, and the breakdown of the equipment, halftime can stretch to nearly 30 minutes.Vrabel wanted his team to feel the physical and mental ""cool down"" that happens during a long concert break. By blasting the music, he forced them to maintain focus and keep their ""game face"" on while the stadium turned into a party outside.This tactic is a direct page out of the Bill Belichick playbook. Belichick famously used to stop practice for up to 30 minutes during Super Bowl week, even delivering a full halftime speech mid-practice to ensure his players didn't lose their edge.Vrabel is clearly betting that if his team can handle 14 minutes of reggaeton and a locker room ""freeze,"" they’ll be ready for whatever happens when the Seahawks try to mount a second-half comeback.The music choice was no accident. With Bad Bunny headlining the halftime show today, Vrabel made sure the ""distraction"" was as realistic as possible.","New England Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel stopped practice for a 14-Minute Bad Bunny concert break.

Frank Warren fuels talk of an unexpected opponent



Frank Warren REACTS to Deontay Wilder STORMING OFF SET & PROCLAIMS 'Dana White IS NO THREAT!'

Oleksandr Usyk was in New York last week for the Ring Awards and the Ring VI boxing event. The show was headlined by Teofimo Lopez against Shakur Stevenson. While the unified heavyweight champion was focused on boxing celebrations, his visit quietly fueled new talk about his next fight. It has now been six months since the Ukrainian star last stepped into the ring, and fans are eager for clarity.For months, speculation pointed toward a long-awaited clash with Deontay Wilder. Wilder remains the only major heavyweight name Usyk has not faced. However, fresh comments from promoter Frank Warren suggest the situation may be shifting. Instead of a traditional boxing rival, Usyk could be heading toward a surprise crossover fight that may delay his title defenses.Frank Warren believes Oleksandr Usyk’s next move could take him outside standard boxing territory. Speaking during fight week events in London, Warren suggested that none of Queensberry’s heavyweight fighters are currently in line to face Usyk. This includes names like Fabio Wardley, Tyson Fury, and rising talent Moses Itauma. According to Warren, this opens the door for something very different.He indicated there is a strong chance Usyk could take a bout against an MMA fighter.Such a decision would likely keep Usyk out of mandatory title defenses for the rest of the year. Warren hinted that several contenders would not be willing to wait around if that happens, especially with mandatory obligations already piling up.The rumored opponent is Rico Verhoeven. He is a former GLORY heavyweight champion and has also boxed professionally in the past. Reports suggest discussions are underway for a fight in May. MMA journalist Ruben Carter has even claimed the bout is close to being finalized for May 9.Not everyone is convinced. Eddie Hearn, who promotes Anthony Joshua, sounded unsure when asked about Verhoeven’s future. He suggested nothing has been finalized yet and left the situation open-ended.Deontay Wilder’s manager Shelly Finkel also weighed in. He believes Wilder remains the biggest name Usyk has not fought. While Wilder must first get past Derek Chisora, Finkel sees Usyk, Joshua, and Wardley as possible next targets if that happens.The buzz intensified after Turki Alalshikh shared interest on social media in seeing Verhoeven face Usyk. Still, WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman said he is unaware of any real progress.","Oleksandr Usyk was in New York last week for the Ring Awards and the Ring VI boxing event.

Iconic No. 23 returns as Anthony Davis steps into Michael Jordan’s Washington legacy



Origin of No. 23: How a simple choice became Michael Jordan’s signature?



Anthony Davis has once again found in the center of a controversy, this time following his recent move to the Washington Wizards just a year after his controversial exit from the Los Angeles Lakers to the Dallas Mavericks in early 2025, a deal that sent the Mavs star player Luka Doncic to the L.A. Lakers.Now in Washington, Davis has opted to play wearing the jersey No. 23, a number left untouched by the franchise ever since Michael Jordan's retirement in 2003. This decision has quickly sparked controversy online, with fans divided over the symbolism of reviving a number that's so closely tied to an NBA icon.Michael Jordan joined the Washington Wizards in 2001 during the third comeback of his legendary career after retiring from the Chicago Bulls. Over nearly 140 games with the Washington Wizards, where he averaged 21.2 points and 5.9 rebounds, according to ESPN.Hailing from Chicago, a 10-time NBA All-Star, Anthony Davis has long admired Michael Jordan. Davis even wore jersey number 23 during his high school playing days, before entering the league with the New Orleans Pelicans as the first overall pick in the 2012 draft. According to multiple US media reports “The Brow” as he is commonly known, has once again chosen the No.23 in Washington, a number the franchise has left unused ever since Jordan wore it during his Wizards tenure from 2001 to 2003.Michael Jordan was deeply shaped by the influence of his older brother Larry Jordan, who also played professional basketball and wore jersey No. 45. Watching his brother compete sparked Jordan's own ambition to follow his footsteps and pursue basketball, thus marking the beginning of one of the greatest careers in sports history.“My brother chose 45 and I chose 23, which was half, rounding the figure. I stuck with 23 and it stayed with me the whole time.”When it came to choosing his number, Jordan opted for No. 23 as a tribute to that bond. He truly believed that the number 23, roughly half of 45, would mean he's “half as good” as his brother, a motivation that drove him to create his legendary legacy.","Anthony Davis has chosen to wear No. 23 in Washington, a number left untouched by the franchise since Michael Jordan's retirement in 2003.

Other notable sales included the 1985 championship ring for $343,700 and the 1980 and 1988 rings, which each brought in $245,500.Abdul-Jabbar on why he chose to auction these items off wrote, ""When it comes to choosing between storing a championship ring or trophy in a room, or providing kids with an opportunity to change their lives, the choice is pretty simple.Sell it all.”""Looking back on what I have done with my life, instead of gazing at the sparkle of jewels or gold plating, celebrating something I did a long time ago, I'd rather look into the delighted face of a child holding their first caterpillar and think about what I might be doing for their future. That's a history that has no price.""Abdul-Jabbar, who played 20 NBA seasons, chose to convert his career milestones to fund Skyhook Foundation’s flagship program, Camp Skyhook, to help bridge the educational gap and encourage fourth and fifth-graders towards a future in STEM.According to foundation data, the program has grown to serve over 70,000 students annually as of 2025.

An intense NHL game between the Boston Bruins and the Florida Panthers became one of the biggest topics in the hockey community when a questionable shot in which Charlie McAvoy of the Bruins struck a Panther player in the back resulted in an acclaimed incident in the hockey community.The aspect of physical play also does not alter the identity of the NHL, yet the occurrence of cases of possible head contact is subject to doubt. As the league has placed a stronger focus on player protection over the last few years, instances such as this tend to create a discussion on whether the fines and additional punishment actually match the danger.In the early game, Sandis Vilmanis of the Florida Panthers hit with a high shot, which seemed to hit Charlie McAvoy on the head. The Bruins defenseman was not able to leave the ice immediately after the collision, and he needed some help; this fact aroused an immediate concern among his teammates and fans. A minor punishment was imposed on Vilmanis by the officials for an illegal check to the head, but many people felt that more had to be done.The scandal was further increased as the NHL Department of Player Safety failed to provide supplemental discipline, as it was reported. Opponents say that it is common to determine a player based on whether or not he is injured as opposed to the type of hit that occurred, which casts doubt on whether there is any consistency in the outcomes of NHL matches.McAvoy is under close follow-up considering that he is a key player to the Boston Bruins line-up and that he might be given global duties.",Charlie McAvoy of the Boston Bruins was hit on the head by Sandis Vilmanis of the Florida Panthers.
