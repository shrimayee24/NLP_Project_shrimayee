‘I still have many good throws left in me’

Beginning Of Neeraj Chopra: When Javelin Star Impressed Coach Despite Finishing 5th In State Meet

Neeraj Chopra, World Champion & Olympic Champion | 'The Road Less Taken Part 2: Highs And Lows'

Road Less Taken Part 3: Higher. Faster. Stronger

PARIS: When Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem cleared 92.97 metres with his effortless second throw in the javelin final Thursday night, the pressure was on Neeraj Chopra to better it.The Indian believed he could do it, but in his desperation to go past his Pakistani rival’s mark, he ended up with four foul throws. Trying to come to terms with his first loss to Nadeem since 2016, Neeraj, who threw 89.45m and bagged silver, said a nagging groin injury has been bothering him.“When I get ready for my throws, 70-80% of my focus is on my injury as I don’t want to aggravate it. My speed drops and so I start pushing myself. Before the last World Championships , the doctor had advised me to go for surgery . But I didn’t have the time. I couldn’t do it before Olympics either. But (now) I will have to make a big decision,” the current world champion said here after the event, adding that the same throw could have been four metres further had he been in perfect shape.Despite the disappointment of not winning back-to-back Olympic gold, many consider Neeraj the greatest-ever Indian athlete. He, though, remains humble. “It’s been a great journey after starting from a small village,” he said.Starting off, Neeraj never believed he would be on the Olympic podium one day. “I didn’t have the physique or the background. I don’t know how I reached this far,” Neeraj said.Talking about his injury, “It was in 2017 that I felt the groin pain for the first time and after that I had a lot of treatment. At the beginning of this year, everything was perfect. Maybe (I have to undergo) surgery… I will speak to my team and make a decision,” Neeraj said. The champion athlete had tried to play down the injury in the build-up to the Olympics, but now that it’s all down, he was ready to explain how difficult it was. “I was not able to throw using my full runway for the last couple of years.Normally, we make 40-50 throws in each session. But in my case the session itself was happening once every two or three weeks because of the injury scare. Till you throw, you are not working with the javelin and then it is very difficult to lift it. But now I’m throwing because I have the belief in my hand,” Neeraj said. The champion said he won’t rest till he manages the big throws.“I still have many good throws left in me. Until I achieve that, I won’t get peace. I now realise that mindset is very important going into an Olympics. I will surely do it if my body is willing to come along as my mind will be ready. If you can stay away from injury, then your throw gets bigger and bigger,” the 26-year-old said. Neeraj’s first throw on Thursday was a foul, but that didn’t affect his confidence.“After the foul in the first throw, I had confidence ahead of the second throw that I could do it. I was pushing myself a lot but the throw was good and I can tell you that I still have a lot of big throws left in me. For that I have to keep myself fit.” Asked what changed between the qualification when he appeared in great form and the final, the 26-year-old said: “In the qualification round it’s all easy and relaxed. But finals are different. I tried to keep my mind the same but it was hard. I tried to go really fast on the runway but it didn’t work.Even in qualification I was really close to the line but I stopped within one step.” The pulls and pressures of commercial commitments become part and parcel of a top athlete’s life, but Neeraj has learnt to take that in his stride.“After Tokyo, I gave priority to sports. With great difficulty we get a chance to endorse a brand. So if you get a chance then who will leave it? But I don’t want to overdo it, because if my body breaks, nothing will be left.” Neeraj was tired but his sense of humour was intact. “Motivating myself to talk in English is almost like being in competition with the best in the business,” he said as everyone burst into laughter.","Neeraj Chopra threw 89.45m and bagged silver in the javelin final.

PARIS: Aman Sehrawat is just 21 but mature way beyond his age. He has been to hell and back.He lost both his parents when he was just 11 years old. His mother took her own life after battling mental illness for years. His father also died soon after. Aman battled depression and tried to take drugs to forget his pain.He was in a dark place. But his uncle Sudhir Sehrawat was a pillar of support. He backed his nephew to concentrate on his wrestling career , take his mind off negative thoughts. His grandfather Mangeram also motivated him.Inspired by Olympian Sushil Kumar 's exploits, Aman had joined Chhatrasal Stadium in Delhi two years before his father passed away. With his uncle holding his hand now, life changed. Aman found peace on the mat. He had a mission in life. He made steady progress, kept reaching new milestones and made newspaper headlines when he became the first Indian to win a gold medal at U-23 World Wrestling Championship .On Friday evening, at the Champs de Mars stadium, a makeshift arena right next to the Eiffel Tower, Aman took on Puerto Rico's Darian Cruz in the 57kg freestylebronze medal match, a weight category in which Ravi Dahiya had won silver for India in Tokyo.Aman dominated his seasoned 29-yearold rival, a three-time medallist at the Pan American Games. After an initial contest, he won comfortably at 13-5. The bronze medal was India's, the country's fifth medal at the Games here.In the first period, Cruz took the lead by grabbing Aman's left leg and pushing him out of the orange circle. 1-0. Aman tried hard to draw level and went up 2-1 soon as he pinned Cruz to the mat. Cruz returned the compliment to go 3-2 up.It was very close at this stage. But Aman started gaining confidence and started attacking more, lunging at Cruz's legs to get the crucial points. He managed to do that midway through the period, to get two points for a 4-3 lead. The Puerto Rican seemed to be tiring now and just before the hooter, Aman got a good grip, Cruz went down to avoid a takedown and Aman was 6-3 ahead.In the second period, Cruz came back determined and got two points. Aman was just a point ahead at 6-5 now. It could have gone either way, but Aman was not giving up. He took two points to go 8-5 ahead. There were just two minutes left for the final hooter. He was looking in control.At this point, Cruz opted for a break, pointing to his left knee. He was trying to catch his breath against the young Indian. After the medical assistance, Cruz was back on the mat, looking a bit tired. Aman saw that and went in for the kill. His strategy was simple. He attacked his rival by grabbing his leg, forcing him to go down and then got on top for two points.With a minute and 7 seconds to go, it was 10-5. With just 45 seconds left, it became 12-5. There was no way Cruz was coming back. Aman secured another point to emerge an easy winner and ran to his coach to celebrate his medal.Hailing from village Birohar in Haryana's Jhajjar district, Aman had a keen interest in mud wrestling as a kid. The move to the mat changed his life.The 21-year-old, the lone Indian in the men's section, had a good outing on Thursday here, posting two big wins to race through the pre-quarters and quarterfinals of the 57kg freestyle.In the quarterfinals, Sehrawat was up against Albania's Zelimkhan Abakarov. The verdict was 12-0 in the Indian's favour as he rattled up the points over the two periods. He had lost to Akabarov at the senior World Championships.Aman lost to his Japanese opponent in the semifinals but returned on Friday to fight for bronze. He was hungry, he was determined. He was the better wrestler.This medal would give some solace to India's wrestling contingent which was in a shock after Vinesh's disqualification. It came as a much-needed balm.","Aman Sehrawat is the first Indian to win a gold medal at U-23 World Wrestling Championship.

She will be 33 when the Games commence.India’s 2012 London Olympics bronze medalist Saina Nehwal believes Sindhu’s future performance will largely depend on her fitness.""Sindhu played well. Bingjiao was a little better. It’s not just about the desire or the will to play; it’s about how your body will support you as you grow older. If your body supports you, you can play for as long as you want,"" Nehwal told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.Sindhu and Nehwal are the only Indian badminton players to have won Olympic medals (one silver and two bronze).Lakshya Sen came close to securing a medal in Paris but lost a tough bronze medal match against Malaysia’s Lee Zii Jia.""Sindhu and I performed well for many years and did our best to popularise badminton in India. We definitely see more young boys (like Lakshya Sen) coming up and doing well. However, progress on the girls' side is taking some time, but I believe we will see more players emerging in the future who can achieve success,"" Nehwal said.Despite India’s six medals in Paris, falling short of the Tokyo Games' tally of seven, many athletes came agonizingly close to winning medals.Shooter Manu Bhaker finished fourth in 25m Pistol, Arjun Babuta was fourth in 10m Air Rifle, archers Dhiraj and Ankita finished fourth in the mixed team event, Anant Jeet and Maheshwari were fourth in the skeet mixed team event, Lakshya Sen lost the bronze medal match, and Mirabai Chanu also finished fourth in weightlifting.Nehwal described these fourth-place finishes as 'painful' but praised Manu for winning two medals at the Paris Games.""Missing out on a medal is definitely disappointing, but as athletes, it's our job to get back to training and look forward to the next Olympics. I know it’s painful because you prepare for four years, and sometimes luck isn’t on your side. It’s definitely tough, but we have to work hard and try again,"" Nehwal said.""I met Manu in January this year, and she was quite sure she would win a medal this time. She achieved that, so hats off to her confidence and preparation. I can only congratulate her on the medals and hope she can add one more to her tally in future Olympics,"" she said.Nehwal also supported providing medal-winning athletes with government/corporate jobs for financial stability and security.""Support from corporates through job opportunities helps sustain budding talent in their careers, so they don’t have to worry about making a living. I’m proud to be employed by BPCL, which has a history of nurturing talent and has inducted over 200 sportspersons across various disciplines,"" Nehwal said.On BPCL's support for sportspersons, a company spokesperson added, ""Consistent with BPCL's philosophy of nurturing and encouraging our country's sporting talent, we have taken on board over 200 sportspersons across various disciplines over the years. Our support helps build their confidence and serves as a springboard for their aspirations.""",Sindhu was expected to become first Indian athlete to win three individual Olympic medals. The 29-year-old reached the Round of 16 but was defeated by China’s He Bingjiao. Nehwal described these fourth-place finishes as 'painful' but praised Manu for winning two medals.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112454310,imgsize-53534,width-400,resizemode-4/112454310.jpg"
From Vinesh Phogat to Manu Bhaker: The roller-coaster ride at Paris Olympics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/from-vinesh-phogat-to-manu-bhaker-the-roller-coaster-ride-at-paris-olympics/articleshow/112455142.cms,"From a worried Vinesh to Nadeem's travelling javelin to the twinkling eyes of Manu, it has been a roller-coaster ride

PARIS: It started with incessant rain on the night of July 26, right next to the gloriously lit Eiffel Tower. It was an opening ceremony like no other. You watched it on big screens as the athletes and officials cruised on boats on the river Seine, waving at the spectators standing in hordes at the riverside.Drenched to the bones in open stands, you watched Zinedine Zidane run into the Trocadero arena with the Olympic flame to deafening applause and hand it over to Rafael Nadal .The Olympic cauldron was finally lit with a burning arrow. It was a spectacle to remember.Then days went by in a blur. It was competition time. The real deal. You got sucked into it. The daily rides in the Metro were the same, the food at the Olympic venues was the same, at every venue! But the action inside every arena had its distinct flavour. It was an emotional roller-coaster ride.For me, the strongest image of Paris 2024, which ended on Sunday, was that of Vinesh Phogat sitting inside the Games Village, deep in thought, after entering the final of 50kg freestyle wrestling. She had fought bravely that day, had beaten the world champion on the way. But she was worried. Not about her American opponent in the final, but her weight. She was 2.7kg overweight and had to shed it overnight. The weigh-in was early morning and it was not going to be easy.She missed it by a mere 100g. That must have weighed like a ton on every Indian's mind. Vinesh was severely dehydrated, mentally a wreck. She has healed physically by now. The mind is another matter.The other image is that of Pakistan 's Nadeem Arshad 's javelin throw that travelled 92.97m at the Stade de France. And how it ended India's hopes of a gold medal repeat in the event. Neeraj Chopra , fighting a groin niggle, had a fantastic throw of 89.45m himself. But there was no way he was going to catch up. There will be another time when Neeraj undergoes surgery and returns to action fitter than he has been in years.Gold and silver. It is massive. The greatest sportsperson of India, ever? Yes, without doubt, and Neeraj is just 26.The train journeys to Chateauroux - 300km south of Paris - will certainly stay in memories - getting up at 4am to catch the train from Paris-Austerlitz and reaching the shooting ranges bleary-eyed. It was made worthwhile by the smiling, twinkling eyes of shooter Manu Bhaker who created history there. She won back-to-back bronze medals and came very close to winning another. No Indian has two medals in the same Games. She has raised the bar. She is just 22, so will surely be back for more.Manu's second medal came in the company of Sarabjot Singh in the mixed 10m air pistol event.Shooting gave us another bronze medal. Swapnil Kusale won it in the 50m rifle 3P event. While the buzz over Manu's two medals had not yet died down, Swapnil, 29, quietly went about his business and pleasantly surprised us all.The hockey bronze was special. They had won it in Tokyo and wanted it again. They won it by beating Spain 2-1. Ten of the team were part of the Tokyo bunch which had got India a hockey medal after 41 years. They knew how to win it.They lost a very close match to Germany in the semifinals. It could have gone either way. It could have broken their confidence. But for them, there was no time to look back. They said they wanted to win a medal for their 36-year-old goalkeeper PR Sreejesh who was playing his farewell match for India. They won it in style. It was after 52 years that India had won back-to-back hockey medals.On the penultimate day, 21-yearold wrestler Aman Sehrawat won us a bronze. It gave some solace after Vinesh's lost medal. Aman has had a difficult life, having lost both his parents by the age of 11. Wrestling saved him from going astray, gave him a purpose in life. He is giving back to the sport and the country. Those close to him say he rarely smiles. After the medal, post the press conference, while posing for a selfie, he smiled. It went straight to the heart.There were six fourth-place finishes for India at the Games: Arjun Babuta in men's 10m air rifle shooting; Dhiraj Bommadevara and Ankita Bhakat in mixed team archery; Mirabai Chanu in weightlifting; Anant Jeet Singh & Maheshwari Chauhan in mixed skeet event; Manu Bhaker in women's 25m pistol and Lakshya Sen in men's singles badminton. Six medals could have very well been 12. And such is the world of sport.Reflecting on India's performance one realized that the city had grown on you. You were reminded of those quick walks out of the competition arenas to enjoy food at the corner café. You were reminded of the volunteers here who made your workplace more comfortable.You were reminded of the croissants at the Chateauroux station, which simply melted in the mouth. You were also reminded of the smiling, welcoming faces of the Sri Lankan Tamils running the provisional store just next to your rented apartment in Belleville.It is time to go home now, with a bag full of memories. Au revoir Paris.","The Games have been an emotional roller-coaster ride for India. Vinesh Phogat, Nadeem Arshad and Swapnil Kusale have all impressed. Manu Bhaker and Amanhrawat have raised the bar for Indian athletes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112455120,imgsize-42542,width-400,resizemode-4/112455120.jpg"
'No rule more unfair for a player than...': Ravichandran Ashwin strongly opposes reintroduction of this IPL auction rule,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/no-rule-more-unfair-for-a-player-than-ravichandran-ashwin-strongly-opposes-reintroduction-of-this-ipl-auction-rule/articleshow/112453507.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has voiced strong criticism against the Right to Match (RTM) rule ahead of its potential reinstatement in the 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL) auction. The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is considering bringing back the RTM rule as they prepare for the IPL 2025 auction later this year. This possibility has ignited debates among players and franchise owners.Recently, the BCCI held a ""constructive dialogue"" with the owners of the ten IPL franchises to address various issues.As per an ANI report, among the topics discussed were the idea of holding mega auctions every five years instead of the current three-year cycle, the reintroduction of the RTM card, the availability of overseas players, and a cap on the number of player retention.Ashwin, speaking on his YouTube channel, criticized the RTM rule, arguing that it is unfair to players as it prevents them from receiving their true market value. According to Ashwin, the rule creates a scenario where the original team benefits at the expense of other bidding franchises and the player involved.""There is no rule more unfair for a player than RTM,"" Ashwin stated. ""The problem with RTM is that it does not give fair value to the player. For example, if a player's value has gone up during the auction due to competitive bidding, the original team can simply match the highest bid without contributing to the increase. This leaves the player without the opportunity to achieve their true market worth.""The RTM rule allows teams to reclaim a player who represented them in the previous season by matching the highest bid placed by another franchise. While this rule has been used in the past to retain valuable players, it was removed in the 2021 mega auction to provide new franchises such as Gujarat Titans and Lucknow Super Giants a broader pool of players to choose from.Ashwin emphasized that while the original team may be satisfied with the outcome, other franchises and the player himself may feel shortchanged by the process. He argued that this undermines the integrity of the auction and prevents players from getting their deserved compensation.""This leaves the player without the opportunity to achieve their true market worth,"" he reiterated, stressing that the rule benefits the original team disproportionately.The discussions between the BCCI and franchise owners are ongoing, and the final decision on the reinstatement of the RTM rule will significantly impact the dynamics of the upcoming IPL auction.",The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is considering bringing back the RTM rule as they prepare for the IPL 2025 auction later this year.

Manu Bhaker: India's History-maker At Paris Olympics 2024

It won't be easy to judge India's campaign at the Paris Olympics. Can we term it a successful one or not? Purely speaking about the number of medals won, India failed to match the tally from the last edition in Tokyo. It won six medals in this edition, in comparison to seven in Tokyo three years ago, which was the best medal haul for the country ever in its Olympic history.With the biggest contingent ever, 117 athletes, India went to Paris with the expectation of touching the double-digit medal tally for the first time.It was a long shot, but there was hope.India started well, with shooter Manu Bhaker winning a bronze in women's 10m air pistol on Day 2 of the competition on July 28. Two days later, Bhaker created history by becoming first Indian to win multiple medals at an Olympic edition, post independence, when she partnered with Sarabjot Singh for a bronze in mixed team 10m air pistol event on July 30.The hope for a double-digit medal tally was further ignited when Swapnil Kusale won India's first medal in rifle 3P event. Kusale struck bronze in men's 50m rifle three position on August 1. Three shooting medals was a great start after the sport drew blank in the last two editions in Rio and Tokyo.But India endured a long medal drought in the next seven days, which left India's hope of touching double digit figures in tatters. From there on, the race was to match the Tokyo success if not bettering it.It had a few medal prospects line-up for the last five days of action. Neeraj Chopra was there, the hockey team was still in, weightlifter Mirabai Chanu and wrestlers were also in contention.On the 11th day of the competition,Vinesh Phogat assured India a medal by becoming the first female Indian wrestler to enter the final. But it was followed by devastating news the very next day, when the grappler was disqualified for being 100g overweight for her 50 kg freestyle final. It was a big jolt for the country as a sure shot medal was wiped out. The IOA and the wrestler have filed an appeal for a silver medal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), whose verdict is now expected by August 13.A day before the Vinesh fiasco, the Indian hockey team lost its semi-final against Germany, leaving them to compete for bronze again. And to add more misery, India's lone weightlifter in Paris, Saikhom Mirabai Chanu, a Tokyo Olympic silver medallist, missed out on a medal by finishing fourth in the 49kg event.The next day, August 8, was a very important one for India as its biggest gold-medal prospect, defending champion Neeraj Chopra, was competing in the javelin throw final.The day started well for India. Before the big javelin final, the Indian hockey team beat Spain 2-1 to win successive bronze medals at the Games. It was the first back-to-back medals for the hockey team in 52 years.In the big javelin final, Pakistan's Arshad Nadeem outclassed the entire field with an Olympic record throw of 92.97m in his second attempt. Tokyo gold medalist Neeraj Chopra responded with a season best throw of 89.45m soon after Nadeem's monstrous attempt. But Neeraj failed to improve his mark and had to settle for a silver in the end.The two medals on August 8 took India's tally to five - one silver and four bronze.On the same day, young wrestler Aman Sehrawat lost his semifinal bout and his bronze match the next day was one of the few medal prospects left for the country at the Games. Sehrawat did not disappoint and won an emphatic bout to become the youngest Indian medalist at 21 on August 9.India's campaign ended on the penultimate day of the Paris Olympics, after wrestler Reetika Hooda went out of medal contention.So the final count for India is six medals - one silver and five bronze. Quite short from their initial ambition of a double-digit figure and a bit behind their best outing ever in Tokyo.So, was it a flop show for India or is there progress despite not improving the medal tally?Abhinav Bindra , India's first individual Olympic gold medallist, praised the Indian contingent for their commendable performance.""I think it's been a spirited performance. All our athletes have performed at a high level,"" Bindra told IANS, emphasizing the significance of their efforts. ""We may have six medals to show on our tally, but if you really go in-depth into performances, we have never had a Games where our athletes have been so competitive across disciplines, many of them have been close to medaling.""It's true, India had quite a few near misses in Paris. It had as many as six fourth place finishes in addition to Vinesh's disqualification. So, seven more medals were in touching distance for Indian athletes this time around. If only two of them had converted into medals, India would have had their best haul ever.So, Bindra is not wrong. Indian athletes have competed at a very high level across disciplines and were very close to medalling too. Hence, we can't call it a total disaster as there are quite a few improvements. But being the world's most populous country and with ever improving facilities for various sports, the number of medals expected and won by the Indian athletes at the Games are still far behind the world standards.","India failed to match the tally from the last edition in Tokyo.

Kieron Pollard of Southern Brave delivered a match-winning performance by hitting Rashid Khan of Trent Rockets for five consecutive sixes during The Hundred on Saturday. His explosive batting helped Southern Brave to chase down a target of 127, achieving victory with just one ball to spare at the Rose Bowl in Southampton.Pollard's game-changing performance began when Brave needed 49 runs off the last 20 balls.Rashid Khan had been economical with figures of 1/10 from his first 15 deliveries, but Pollard dismantled his bowling in a single over.Pollard smashed the first two balls over cow corner and the long-off region, followed by a straight hit back over Rashid's head with the third ball. A powerful shot over deep mid-wicket came next, and Pollard topped off the over with a final six over long-off. This assault reduced the runs required to 19 off 15 balls.Despite being dismissed shortly after his blitz, Pollard’s rapid 45 off 23 balls had already shifted the momentum in Southern Brave's favor. The team ultimately won the contest by two wickets with just one ball remaining.Earlier in the game, Tom Banton top-scored for Trent Rockets with 30 runs, helping his team to post a competitive total of 126/8.Reflecting on his performance against Rashid Khan, Pollard acknowledged their shared history and familiarity with each other's play.""I've played a lot against him, and he's gotten me out many times. But I knew the lines and lengths he was likely to bowl,"" Pollard said.""I just backed myself - if he bowled short, I was going across; if he went full, I was going to hit straight. He bowled three fuller balls, and they were right in my arc. At that point, I couldn't hold back, I had to go for maximums. But Rashid is a world-class bowler; we've played a lot against each other,"" he added.Pollard's performance not only secured a crucial victory for Southern Brave but also underscored his reputation as one of the most formidable hitters in the sport.","Kieron Pollard hit five consecutive sixes during The Hundred on Saturday.

However, Pooran, alongside Harry Brook and Adam Hose , rose to the occasion, producing a batting masterclass to secure the victory.The high-scoring encounter was a testament to the excellent batting surface at Emirates Old Trafford. Phil Salt and Max Holden had set the tone early on, with the score reaching 86 for 2 when Holden was dismissed on the 34th ball. Despite the Superchargers' efforts to curb the scoring rate, they still faced a formidable task at the interval.Pooran's incredible performance, which has become a hallmark of his campaign, saw him dispatch bowlers with ease, making the seemingly impossible look effortless. With crucial support from Brook and Hose, Pooran's innings kept the Superchargers' hopes alive in the tournament.Pooran said, ""If we lost the game today we'd be out of the tournament, I'm happy that I can be there to the end, contribute, get the win for the team and hopefully the result will be the same again on Tuesday as well.""","Nicholas Pooran hit 66 off just 33 deliveries, which included eight sixes.

"'I'm not going to defend Virat Kohli, but...': Dinesh Karthik on India batter's dismissals in SL ODIs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/im-not-going-to-defend-virat-kohli-but-dinesh-karthik-on-india-batters-dismissals-in-sl-odis/articleshow/112445010.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former India wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik has expressed his opinion regarding Virat Kohli 's performance in the recent ODI series against Sri Lanka, which India lost 2-0.Karthik believes that there is no cause for concern about Kohli's form, considering the challenging conditions faced by all Indian batsmen on pitches that heavily favored spinners.The Indian batting lineup encountered significant difficulties while playing at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. The Sri Lankan spinners dominated the proceedings, exploiting the conducive conditions to their advantage.Out of the 30 Indian wickets that fell during the three-match series, an astonishing 27 were claimed by the hosts' spin bowlers, highlighting their effectiveness on the turning tracks.This series loss marks the first time in 27 years that India has been defeated by Sri Lanka in a bilateral ODI series.""It's been a tough pitch to play spin in this series, let's admit that first. Be it Virat Kohli, be it Rohit Sharma , or be it anyone else. With the slightly semi-new ball between overs about 8 to 30, it's been hard work (for batters).""It's nothing to worry about. Not too many pitches work that way, but it's been a tough pitch to play spinners. I'm not going to defend Virat Kohli here, but I can tell you that playing spin was very hard,"" said Karthik in a video on Cricbuzz, as quoted by IANS.Karthik also emphasized the positives for India from the series, which they can leverage in the future, particularly in the lead-up to the 2025 Champions Trophy.""The biggest positive is the fact that India played all-rounders and bravely attacked. So that is something I really like, that is one. Number two, Riyan Parag , in his limited opportunities, is showing what he can do with the ball, which is again a small plus for us.""""Other than that, I think Rohit's batting is itself. The way he starts in powerplay. He is making batting look too easy in the series. Batted beautifully. These were the positives for me from this series.Karthik discussed why Indian batters struggle when facing spin on slow pitches. ""When you first end up playing international cricket, you end up playing a lot more quality fast-bowling. But the truth is, when every team ends up playing three fast-bowlers, and at times, four of them with just one spinner or sometimes two, we play on slow turning pitches, which doesn't happen too often.""So, when you come from domestic cricket and go into international cricket, you focus on playing fast-bowling and hence, it is understandable of players losing their quality to play spin bowling over a period of time.""Karthik signed off by terming what should the IPL mega auction system ahead of 2025 season.""I feel four to five (retentions) is a good number, but one or two Right to Match is also a very good option. But one small change in the Right to Match option is, once the player is bid for and the right to match option is used, I think bidding can still go on.""If the team which has won the first bid believe they have something in their kitty to bid for that player, in that way, the player will get fair money, and the bidding has to happen between the team which has used the Right to match, and the team which has bid for him until then to get that player.""","Dinesh Karthik says there is no cause for concern about Virat Kohli's form. Former India wicketkeeper-batter says it's been a tough pitch to play spin in this series. India lost the series 2-0, the first time in 27 years that they have been beaten by Sri Lanka.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112445004,imgsize-46608,width-400,resizemode-4/112445004.jpg"

Arshad Ayub and Venkatapathy Raju were bowling. They were very good and me and Sachin had a long partnership,"" news agency PTI quoted Vengsarkar as saying.Vengsarkar added that Tendulkar’s performance on the turning track hinted at his potential for a successful career in cricket.“He was going so well on a turning track. I thought he was going to go places and that is what happened,” he said.Vengsarkar, the former chairman of selectors, also dug out a nugget from that famous Ranji Trophy final between Mumbai and Haryana in 1991.“There was this match in 1991 against Haryana — the Ranji Trophy final — and the way he batted…we were chasing 355 and we were 22 for three wickets (34/3).“The way he played in that innings was absolutely brilliant. We could have won the game had he stayed there a couple of overs more,” said Vengsarkar, who made a valiant 139 while Tendulkar scored 96.In one of the most memorable Ranji Trophy finals, the domestic giants Mumbai lost the final by a mere two runs against Kapil Dev-led Haryana.Vengsarkar also remembered that former India skipper Sourav Ganguly, who made his ODI debut in January 1992, was initially picked as a ‘fourth seamer' during the tour of Australia.“On that tour he was selected as the fourth seamer and he was asked to go to the nets. After two deliveries, he said ‘I am not a bowler and I want to bat'.“Ganguly was told that he was picked as the fourth seamer. But he did not get opportunities on that tour. After a few years, he was picked for the tour of England,” he said.Vengsarkar also praised former India skipper and T20 World Cup-winning coach Rahul Dravid for the gradual improvement he made as a player.“Every batsman must improvise. You cannot bat in the first gear all the time. You have to bat in the second, third and the fourth gear. As the years passed by, Rahul improved tremendously and was one of the best batsmen in the world,” Vengsarkar said.The Mumbaikar also recalled VVS Laxman's 281 against Australia in Kolkata in 2001 was ‘important' as it changed India's mentality.“It was very important because India won against Australia. They were a strong team that time. Rahul also played very well,” he said.",Dilip Vengsarkar recalls Sachin Tendulkar's impressive performance against spinners Arshad Ayub and Venkatapathy Raju during a Ranji Trophy match.

He disclosed that the series defeat against South Africa in the 2021-22 season was the lowest point of his coaching career with the Men in Blue.In the 2021-22 season, Virat Kohli-led India had a golden opportunity to secure their maiden series victory against South Africa on their home soil.The visitors began the series with a resounding 113-run victory in the opening Test at Centurion, raising expectations of a historic triumph.However, the Proteas staged a remarkable comeback in the following two Tests, clinching both matches by seven wickets, despite India holding the upper hand at various stages. The South African team's resilience and determination shone through as they secured a memorable series win.Speaking to Star Sports, Dravid said, as quoted by ANI, ""If you ask me what is the lowest point, I would say that the South Africa Test series early on in my career. We won the first Test match in South Africa in Centurion, and then we were playing in the second and third Test match. We have never won a series in South Africa, as you know. It was a really big opportunity for us to win that series. Some of our senior players were not there.""Dravid shared that several senior players, including Rohit Sharma , missed the series. Despite this, India managed to compete closely with the Proteas in both matches. However, South Africa ultimately limited India to low scores when it mattered most and comfortably chased down their targets.""Rohit Sharma was injured, and we didn't have some senior players in that series. But we were very close, and in both the Test matches--the second and the third test matches--in the third innings, we had a big opportunity. We could have set a decent score and won the game, but South Africa played well. They chased back in the fourth innings. So I would say that that was probably my lowest point in my coaching career--not being able to win that series in spite of being ahead,"" he added.Dravid had an impressive tenure as the coach of Team India , capping it off with an ICC T20 World Cup victory after a thrilling win over South Africa in June this year in Barbados.Prior to this, India finished as runners-up in the 50-over World Cup on home soil last year, after an impressive 10-match winning streak that ended with a loss to Australia. The team also secured the runner-up spot in the ICC World Test Championship, again to Australia, and claimed the 50-over Asia Cup title last year.","Rahul Dravid says defeat against South Africa in 2021-22 season was lowest point of his coaching career with the Men in Blue.

The result leaves Mohun Bagan rooted in the mid-table with 12 points from 8 matches.East Bengal FC, Bhawanipore Club and Calcutta Customs are currently the top three teams with 19 points each and on track for advancing from Group B to the Super Six (championship round).Even if Deggie Cardozo's Mohun Bagan win their remaining four matches, their fate may not be in their hands.With their fifth win, George Telegraph under Gautam Ghosh kept their hopes alive with 15 points from 9 matches.Mohun Bagan came into the match looking for a hat-trick of wins following their demolition of Eastern Railway (5-0) and Tollygunge Agragami (5-1).Cardozo's boys went about achieving their target in earnest when referee Nripen Halder judged George defender Akash Mukherjee's attempted clearance to have touched his teammate Juwel Mazumder's hands, despite the latter's intense protest against the decision. From the resultant penalty, Serto Worneilen sent the goalkeeper the wrong way to give Bagan the lead in the 30th minute.However, Bagan were undone by their poor finishing as well as poor defending.On the first occasion, Bagan captain Sumit Rathi failed to check the run of Harsha Parui, whose cross saw Samaresh Das meet it with a powerful header at the other end. As the ball ricocheted off the first post, Ekka was nearby to drive it in.Three minutes later, it was Bagan goalkeeper Raja Barman who made a mess of a back-pass. Although he managed to block Abhishek Chakraborty's initial shot, Ekka's powerful left-footer off the return ball did the decisive damage.

Indian players must play abroad, even if it's in lower division

NEW DELHI: Manolo Marquez , the newly appointed head coach of the Indian football team , described his new role as a 'dream come true' but emphasized that in the future, the national team should ideally be managed by an Indian.The 55-year-old Spaniard's tenure, effective from last month, will span three years, during which he will fulfill a dual role as both the head coach of FC Goa and the national team.Marquez, who will manage FC Goa during the 2024-25 season alongside his national team responsibilities, will transition to exclusively coaching the Indian team from 2025.""Apart from Spain, India is the country where I have spent the most number of years. Long time ago, I thought I would like to be a national team head coach and I am here. It is a dream come true,"" Marquez said while addressing his first press conference after his appointment as India head coach.""In the future, the national team coach has to be an Indian because he (Indian) will know better how the country works, knows the people of different parts of India. So, this has to be the target of Indian football in the coming years,"" he added.Marquez has been active in Indian football since 2020, having spent three successful seasons with Hyderabad FC. He also had a notable season with FC Goa, achieving a third-place finish in the Indian Super League (ISL ) this year. His upcoming international assignments include the three-team Intercontinental Cup, to be held in Hyderabad from September 3 to 9, featuring Syria and Mauritius alongside India.Following the Intercontinental Cup, Marquez will lead the team in the VFF Tri-Nation Series in Vietnam from October 9 to 15, competing against Lebanon and hosts Vietnam. Both tournaments will take place during the FIFA international match window, and the national camp for the Intercontinental Cup is scheduled to commence on August 30 or 31.Addressing concerns about potential conflicts of interest while serving as both India head coach and FC Goa manager, Marquez stated that this situation, although unusual, is not unprecedented.""It's not a normal situation, no doubt, but it's not the first time and won't be the last time regarding this situation.""I checked, in international level, there were big names earlier in same situation and in India, I am told there were many (such cases) earlier.""National team plays when there is no ISL. You won't have any doubt that we will work very hard for the national team.""Having failed to make it to the third round of the joint 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 Asian Cup qualifiers under Stimac, India are yet to qualify for the continental showpiece. The team will have to play in the qualifying round of the 2027 Asian cup from March next year onwards.""The target is to improve the level of Indian football -- individually as players as well as a team. No doubt, that will not be immediate but will take time,"" said the experienced coach who has managed several lower division sides in the Spanish league.""Our target is to win every match, but the long term one is to qualify for the Asian Cup in 2027. We will get 6-7 games before the Asian Cup qualifiers,"" Marquez said.""So, these two upcoming tournaments (Intercontinental Cup and VFF Tri-Nation Series) are important so that we can be in good seeding during the draw (for the Asian Cup qualifiers) in December this year.""""The best players will have to play at the best level, against stronger opponents. That is how you grow as a player. That is why more Indian players should play in the ISL. That is why my advice to Indian players is to play abroad even if it is lower division leagues.""They will learn more and improve more (by playing abroad). But the Indian players are comfortable playing in the ISL, in India but I want them to play abroad,"" Marquez said, adding that Indian football has improved in the last five years but can improve further.Marquez also said he will pick I-League players for the national team, if they have the requisite level.Asked what is lacking in an Indian player as seen in his five-year association with the country at club level, he said, ""It's the mentality of the players, we need to improve on this. We have to develop that we can do something, we have to be stronger in mentality.""If the mentality is right, we will get good results.
