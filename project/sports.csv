Wayne Gretzky once turned down $1 million from Rangers owner James Dolan to delay retirement by just one week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/wayne-gretzky-once-turned-down-1-million-from-rangers-owner-james-dolan-to-delay-retirement-by-just-one-week/articleshow/122280139.cms,"New York Rangers owner James Dolan made an extraordinary offer to Wayne Gretzky (Getty Images)

Dolan ’s million-dollar offer was about more than money

Wayne Gretzky: I wish I could still play

Wayne Gretzky said no, prioritizing integrity over payday

When Wayne Gretzky decided to retire in April 1999, the NHL lost more than just a player—it marked the exit of a once-in-a-lifetime icon. But what many don’t know is that just 24 hours before “The Great One” made his final decision, New York Rangers owner James Dolan made an astonishing last-minute attempt to keep him in the game—with a $1 million offer, simply to reconsider.According to Gretzky himself, Dolan approached him with an incredible proposition: $1 million just to delay his retirement announcement by one week. “There were no strings attached,” Gretzky recalled. “If Gretzky still wanted to retire after those seven days, the money was still his to keep.” The offer, unlike anything seen in pro sports before, wasn’t about performance—it was about giving a legend more time to reflect on a career-altering decision.It wasn’t a contract extension, nor a marketing ploy. Dolan's offer was purely a gesture of respect. He knew the kind of legacy Gretzky carried—not just as a player but as the face of an entire generation of hockey fans. Dolan had only recently taken control of the Rangers but understood instantly that Gretzky was no ordinary star.Despite the tempting offer, Gretzky turned Dolan down. “In good conscience, I just can’t take your money.Because I know I’m done,” he told the owner. In a 2016 interview with Graham Bensinger, Gretzky joked, “It was the dumbest thing I’ve ever done, right? But that’s just how classy their organization was.”The decision proved Gretzky’s legendary discipline wasn’t just on the ice. He wasn’t going to cash in if his heart was no longer in the game. Gretzky’s final game at Madison Square Garden became a celebration. His unmatched records—894 goals, 1,963 assists, 2,857 total points—remain sacred ground in NHL history.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky threatened to cancel daughter’s wedding over Dustin Johnson’s drug abuse scandal Even though he turned down Dolan’s $1 million, that story stands as proof of the deep respect he inspired and the class with which he exited the game.","New York Rangers owner James Dolan offered Wayne Gretzky $1 million to delay his retirement announcement by one week.

‘Dumb a**’: Fans react as Dallas Cowboys WR KaVontae Turpin arrested in Texas for illegal weapon and marijuana possession,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/dumb-a-fans-react-as-dallas-cowboys-wr-kavontae-turpin-arrested-in-texas-for-illegal-weapon-and-marijuana-possession/articleshow/122284421.cms,"Photo by Perry Knotts/Getty Images

Dallas Cowboys ’ $18 million bet on KaVontae Turpin faces backlash and uncertainty after All-Pro returner’s shocking holiday weekend arrest

KaVontae Turpin arrest casts doubt on Dallas Cowboys offensive plans and special teams strategy

Dallas Cowboys weigh consequences as KaVontae Turpin’s arrest threatens team stability

Just four months after the Dallas Cowboys made KaVontae Turpin the highest-paid special teams player in NFL history, their $18 million commitment is suddenly clouded by scandal. Early Sunday morning, on July 6, Turpin was arrested in Allen, Texas, for misdemeanor marijuana possession and unlawfully carrying a weapon, according to Collin County court records reviewed by CBS News Texas. The arrest has sparked a firestorm of fan backlash and raised serious questions about whether Turpin—who overcame years of setbacks to become an All-Pro—can be trusted to stay on the field. For a team desperate to break through in the playoffs, this is the kind of offseason chaos no one wanted.KaVontae Turpin’s arrest unfolded during the long holiday weekend, when NFL coaches famously brace for late-night calls. On Monday morning, Cowboys offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer confirmed what fans feared: “During the slow time, NFL coaches dread that phone call,” he said. “And now I’ve gotten exactly that.”According to court records, Turpin was booked and released on separate bonds of $500 for the marijuana charge and $1,000 for unlawfully carrying a weapon. Though marijuana violations no longer guarantee suspensions under NFL rules, they typically lead to enhanced testing and fines. The weapons charge could invite further discipline, adding to the sense of uncertainty swirling around the Cowboys’ offseason plans.As news of the arrest broke, one fan summed up the collective groan with a biting tweet:“Cowboys already takin L’s. Yes sir.”The timing couldn’t be worse. Dallas just cleared over $50 million in cap space ahead of free agency, then handed Turpin a three-year deal worth $6 million per season—an unprecedented figure for a returner. The front office hoped the contract would finally unlock a bigger offensive role for Turpin, who exploded last season with 904 kick return yards, 420 receiving yards, and three total touchdowns.KaVontae Turpin’s contract all but confirms the Cowboys will use him more on offense, multiple reports agreed when the deal was announced. The plan was to line him up alongside CeeDee Lamb, especially after Brandin Cooks missed seven games and Jalen Tolbert struggled with consistency.Some fans weren’t so forgiving of Turpin’s latest misstep. One tweet captured the frustration and expectation of consequences:“You dumb a**! No doubt will be suspended.”KaVontae Turpin’s off-field trouble isn’t new. He went undrafted in 2019 out of TCU because of prior issues, then rebuilt his career through The Spring League, the European League of Football, and the USFL—where he was named MVP. His hard-fought comeback peaked with a Pro Bowl rookie season in 2022.But for all the optimism surrounding his new deal, this arrest threatens to derail that narrative. As one cynical fan put it on social media:“Not a true Cowboys player until you’re arrested.”While no immediate roster moves have been announced, the Cowboys may now be forced to explore contingency plans. Free agent returners and depth receivers could be on the radar if league discipline sidelines Turpin.KaVontae Turpin’s story was supposed to be about redemption—a journey from undrafted outcast to Pro Bowl game-breaker. But Sunday’s arrest in Allen is a sobering reminder that talent alone doesn’t erase off-field risk. As the Cowboys weigh their next steps, fans are left wondering if this $18 million gamble will pay off—or become yet another cautionary tale.Also Read: ‘Worst RB room in the league’: Colin Cowherd rips Dallas Cowboys for passing on Saquon Barkley and Derrick Henry",KaVontae Turpin was arrested for misdemeanor marijuana possession and unlawfully carrying a weapon.

Did Josh Allen just betray Nike?

(Image via AP)

The New Balance moment that made fans think he’s done with Nike



“Nike letting just anybody slip away… New Balance it is 💰😮‍💨”

“Wondering how many in Bills Mafia will switch to New Balance.”

So why New Balance? Fans have theories and jokes

Josh Allen just stepped into something new, literally. The Buffalo Bills’ golden boy was spotted rocking New Balance sneakers, and the internet instantly lost its grip. No flashy Nike logo. No loud rollout. Just Josh, a chilled-out tee, black shorts, and dad shoes that scream, “Yeah, I’m comfy—and what about it?”Now, people are scrambling to figure out what it means. Is he officially leaving Nike? Is New Balance gearing up to sign their biggest NFL name yet? Or did Josh Allen just decide that 2025 is the year of orthopedic drip?The viral photo, showed Allen walking away from his car wearing New Balance sneakers. The caption said it all:And that’s not just a throwaway comment, Josh Allen was previously signed to Nike in a multi-year endorsement deal starting back in 2021. But now? There’s no Swoosh in sight.Another fan chimed in with the realest question of them all:While there’s no official New Balance endorsement announcement (yet), fans are already piecing it together. New Balance has been on a hot streak lately, lacing up stars like Kawhi Leonard and Coco Gauff. Now, if Josh Allen joins that club? It’s a major flex for the brand that used to scream suburban dad energy and now screams elite athlete with chill confidence.This isn’t just a sneaker swap. It’s a full-on vibe shift. While some QBs go all-in on flashy fits and loud branding, Allen is taking the low-key route: subtle flexes, casual power moves, and now, New Balance.It’s the same energy we’re seeing from guys like Joe Burrow (with his Midwest monotone drip) and Jalen Hurts (who walks into pressers like it’s business class). Josh Allen isn’t out here chasing clout, he’s building a brand of his own. And it starts with walking away from Nike like it was no big deal.If this is a breakup with Nike, it’s the quietest mic drop of the offseason. Josh Allen didn’t need a flashy announcement. He just wore what he wanted and let the internet do the talking. Whether it turns into an official endorsement or not, one thing is clear: New Balance just got a major upgrade. And Josh? He’s clearly in his “I do what I want” era and the shoes match perfectly.Also read - Was Yung Miami warning Cardi B the whole time?

Taylor Swift calls Travis Kelce “my boyfriend” during heartwarming hospital visit

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are over the engagement pressure, says insider

The rumor mill has been working overtime when it comes to Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. From fan speculation to wedding planner gossip, everyone seems to have an opinion about where their relationship is headed. But Swift herself may have just put the endless engagement chatter to rest — without needing a dramatic announcement or publicist's memo.While making a touching appearance at a children’s hospital recently, Taylor Swift, 35, casually referred to the Kansas City Chiefs star as “my boyfriend” — a quiet but clear statement caught on video and shared on social media platform X. That one phrase might have done more to quiet engagement rumors than any press release ever could.This comes on the heels of viral buzz surrounding a wedding planner’s statement that she had been asked to send an invite addressed to “Taylor and Travis Kelce.” Naturally, Swifties turned into online detectives overnight, digging for clues about a possible secret wedding or engagement. But the casually delivered ""my boyfriend"" reference served as a subtle but firm reminder: the two are still dating — not married.Behind the scenes, it seems the couple is navigating the downside of being one of pop culture’s most-watched pairs. “Taylor and Travis are tired of all the pressure and endless discussion about their status,” a source close to the couple told Star Magazine. “They’re just enjoying being together right now, especially after all their time apart when she was on tour last year.”And with Taylor’s “Eras” tour taking her around the globe and Kelce’s NFL schedule heating up, carving out time for each other is already a feat in itself. Adding public engagement expectations to the mix only ramps up the stress.Despite her declaration, fan theories and media speculation aren’t going away anytime soon. But the insider insists the couple isn’t operating on anyone else’s timeline: “When there’s news to share, they will.” In other words, don’t expect a rushed engagement or secret elopement just to satisfy online chatter.Also Read: “He isn't going to ask for her hand”: Travis Kelce holds off on proposing to Taylor Swift despite their strong and supportive relationship In a world where celebrities are often forced to perform their relationships for public approval, Swift and Kelce seem to be drawing a line — choosing real connection over pressure-fueled milestones.

ESPN gets DESTROYED for DISRESPECTFUL post announcing the DEATH of White Sox champ Bobby Jenks!





Beyond “just on the roster”: Jenks’s true impact



Bobby Jenks, Former White Sox Pitcher, Dead at 44

A recent social media post by ESPN announcing the death of former Major League Baseball closer Bobby Jenks has ignited sharp criticism from fans, former teammates, and media commentators. In its brief X post, ESPN referred to Jenks as simply “on the roster when the franchise won the 2005 World Series,” a description many felt severely downplayed his pivotal role. Jenks, a two-time All‑Star, played a crucial part in Chicago’s championship run, not just as a member of the team but as its closer—securing key saves in both the ALDS and the World Series. He passed away at age 44 in Sintra, Portugal, after battling adenocarcinoma. The tone-deaf announcement prompted demands for a more accurate and respectful tribute.ESPN’s original post on X read:The phrase “” triggered immediate scorn. Former first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz reacted sharply:Catchers A.J. Pierzynski and Brandon McCarthy likewise voiced their displeasure. Pierzynski emphasized:Media critics reinforced that this phrasing failed to acknowledge Jenks' performance—he wasn’t merely a rostered player but a dominant closer whose fastball topped 100 mph and whose contribution was indispensable during Chicago’s sweep of Houston.As a rookie in 2005, Jenks became the dependable late-inning option, appearing in all four World Series games and securing the final outs in Games 1 and 4. During that postseason run he pitched six games, notching multiple saves—one clincher in the ALDS and two in the Fall Classic—and helping seal Chicago’s series sweep. He finished his career with an impressive 173 saves, two All-Star appearances (2006 and 2007), and a 3.53 ERA. Beyond his playing days, Jenks went on to coach in the minor leagues, managing teams such as the Grand Junction Rockies and the Windy City ThunderBolts. He was named Manager of the Year in 2022 and remained active in baseball even amid his health struggles.Soon-to-be-held events, such as the 20th‑anniversary celebration of the 2005 White Sox, have taken on a more somber tone following his passing. Former manager Ozzie Guillen and Hall‑of‑Famer Frank Thomas publicly noted the team was “crushed” by the loss, sharing memories of Jenks’s competitive fire and character.The terse wording of ESPN’s announcement sharply contrasted with the significance of Bobby Jenks’s legacy. Describing him as merely “on the roster” prompted a justified outcry for journalistic responsibility and accuracy. Jenks was far more than a nominal team member—he was the closer who delivered historic postseason performances, an All‑Star, a championship cornerstone, and later, a mentor in baseball’s coaching ranks. His death at 44, following a valiant fight against adenocarcinoma, leaves a void both on and off the field. As tributes continue, the baseball community rightly insists on commemorating Jenks as the impactful athlete, coach, husband, father, and friend he truly was.","Bobby Jenks, a two-time All-Star pitcher for the Chicago White Sox, died on Friday in Sintra, Portugal, after battling adenocarcinoma.

Hearing to resolve counsel motions as filing delay raises questions

PR firestorm, ESPN leave, and the road ahead

NFL Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe is facing a crucial legal moment as a July 9, 2025, court hearing in Clark County, Nevada will address motions related to his legal team in the ongoing civil sexual assault lawsuit filed against him more than two months ago. Despite promises of a counterclaim and widespread attention over a reported $10 million settlement offer, Sharpe has not yet formally responded to the complaint. With the NFL preseason approaching and his ESPN return still in question, the hearing marks the first major development in a case that has simmered quietly after dominating headlines during the draft season.The court docket confirms that the hearing—originally scheduled for June 30—will now take place at 10:00 a.m. on July 9, focused on three motions to associate new legal counsel. This signals internal activity within Sharpe’s legal camp, but no formal answer to the civil complaint or counterclaim has been filed as of July 6. The legal deadline to respond is typically within 30 days, though informal extensions are often granted between attorneys.Sharpe’s lawyer, Lanny Davis, had stated in an early press briefing: “Shannon will file a counterclaim against the plaintiff.”However, that pledge has yet to materialize in court. The Clark County civil court system shows attorney-related filings but no documentation addressing the plaintiff’s core allegations.When the lawsuit was first filed, Davis publicly revealed that Sharpe had offered “at least $10 million” to settle the case, a disclosure that backfired and fueled several days of intense media scrutiny. The public relations strategy was widely seen as ill-advised, especially since the case has since remained dormant in terms of legal response.Also read: NFL star Patrick Mahomes’ wife Brittany is quietly dropping bombshells as her WAG fame explodes online Shortly after the news broke, Sharpe stepped away from his role at ESPN, stating he would return by the start of the NFL preseason.

What unfolds during the July 9 hearing could determine both the pace of the lawsuit and whether his high-profile media comeback stays on track.","NFL Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe is facing a crucial legal moment.

Networks block top talent from Netflix 's holiday NFL takeover

Tom Brady's off-field life remains under the spotlight

Tom Brady may have found his stride as a broadcaster, but his second season in the Fox Sports booth is already facing serious turbulence. The seven-time Super Bowl champ, who signed a massive $375 million, 10-year deal to join Fox’s top NFL commentary team, is reportedly being sidelined from one of the biggest TV moments of the year — the NFL’s Christmas Day games.According to sources cited by Michael McCarthy and Ryan Glasspiegel, Fox Sports plans to withhold its biggest stars — including Tom Brady, Kevin Burkhardt, Michael Strahan, and Terry Bradshaw — from participating in Netflix’s Christmas coverage of two high-profile games. That’s a serious blow to the streaming platform, which is investing heavily in building its sports footprint by airing marquee NFL matchups like Cowboys vs. Commanders and Lions vs. Vikings.The move reflects escalating turf wars between traditional TV powerhouses and streaming giants as the NFL expands into digital broadcasting. “Some rival networks are bristling at the idea of lending their on-air talents to the streaming behemoth,” the report states, revealing that ESPN is also barring its talent from appearing on Netflix’s coverage.Last year, CBS and NBC made exceptions by letting their announcers cross over.But this season, both Fox and ESPN appear to be drawing a hard line. It leaves Netflix scrambling to fill high-caliber commentary slots while fans are left wondering what voices will guide them through some of the year’s most-watched games.While Brady may be benched from Netflix’s NFL broadcasts, he's still grabbing headlines. The former Patriots and Buccaneers star made waves at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s opulent Venice wedding, where he was reportedly spotted “chatting up” actress Sydney Sweeney, fresh off her own breakup.

A legacy with something to prove returns for a third try at DCC

Emotional fallout, a strained friendship, and a quiet comeback

Dayton Bramhall's journey with the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders has been anything but easy — and her story has become one of the most emotional arcs in Season 2 of Netflix's America’s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. A third-time auditionee and daughter of longtime DCC associate choreographer Shelly Bramhall, Dayton came into the 2024 training camp with the weight of a legacy and the pressure to finally make the team. But after once again being cut, the young dancer made a decision that would redefine her identity beyond the DCC brand.Raised in McKinney, Texas, Dayton Bramhall has been immersed in the world of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders her entire life. Her mother, Shelly, was part of the DCC class of 1989 and has served as a key figure on the staff for years. That connection, however, didn’t secure Dayton a spot. “None of us want you to make this team just because you have a history,” director Kelli Finglass told her bluntly. “You need to earn to make this team. ”Despite showing improvement and passion during her audition, Dayton struggled with memorizing choreography and keeping up with the precision and power expected at the elite level.“There’s one that just won’t stick in my body, but I’ll get it,” she said during training camp. Unfortunately, the veterans didn’t believe she was ready — and Finglass ultimately told her it would be a “disservice to have you make this team and the struggle be all year. ”While Dayton took the cut with grace, the decision left ripples in her personal life. Her mother Shelly admitted, “That was hard because we were friends. If anything, I wasn’t hurt by her not making it, I was way more hurt by Kelli and Judy.” Despite the tension, Dayton chose to tell her mom herself, showing maturity beyond her years.She returned in 2025 for another shot — but was cut again before training camp. In a heartfelt comment on TikTok, Dayton wrote, “I did EVERYTHING they asked of me and tried my absolute best to fit their mold. I’m not wanted there and I’m hoping this takes me to where I truly belong.”Also Read: Where is Armani Latimer now?

It was a press conference to remember as Indian captain Shubman Gill delivered a moment of levity following India's historic 336-run win over England in the second Test at Edgbaston on Sunday.

With a mischievous grin, Gill paused, scanned the room dramatically, and fired back: ""I can't see… My favourite journalist. Where is he?""The room erupted in laughter, with players and media alike appreciating the good-humoured jibe.Gill then turned reflective, saying, ""I actually wanted to see him, but I even said before the Test match that I don't really believe in stats or histories.""He continued, ""Over the last 50-60 years, we've played just seven matches here - different teams, different eras. I believe this is the best Indian team to come to England. We've got the capability to beat them, to win the series from here. And we've got the right momentum with us.""With the mood buoyant and belief sky-high, India head into the third Test at Lord's starting July 10, eyeing a historic series turnaround.",India beat England by 336 runs in the second Test at Edgbaston.

India Dominate Day 4! Siraj & Akash Deep Rattle England

NEW DELHI: Experience counts — especially when a seasoned player knows how to control the tempo in high-pressure situations. On the final day of the second Test at Edgbaston, with India chasing a historic win, one such subtle but crucial moment played out during the morning session.India were looking to break the partnership between Ben Stokes and Jamie Smith when Ravindra Jadeja was handed the ball for the final over before lunch. He had a brief discussion with captain Shubman Gill, and then cleverly bowled his six deliveries in under 100 seconds, not allowing Smith any time to settle at the crease. The rapid over meant that India had time for one more before the lunch break.Seemingly as per plan, Gill tossed the ball to Washington Sundar for the bonus over — a calculated gamble that paid off immediately.On the final delivery before lunch, Sundar removed England captain Ben Stokes, dealing a massive blow to the hosts. Stokes’ dismissal left England reeling at 153/6, with India needing just four more wickets to seal their first-ever Test win at Edgbaston.After the wicket, Jadeja was seen high-fiving an ecstatic Gill — a moment that summed up the planning and execution behind the dismissal.On a typically unpredictable English day, heavy cloud cover and intermittent rain gave way to bright sunshine.Play started after a 1 hour 40-minute delay, leaving India with 80 overs to bowl out England, who began the day at 72 for 3, chasing an improbable 608.Prasidh Krishna opened the bowling with Akash Deep, who stood out in the morning session. For the first time in the high-scoring Test, the pitch showed signs of wear, and Akash Deep extracted sharp seam movement off the surface. Surprisingly, Mohammed Siraj did not share the new ball with him.Akash Deep struck in his second over, cleaning up Ollie Pope as the batter chopped on. In his very next over, he sent down a vicious nip-backer that hit a crack and trapped Harry Brook lbw — a near-unplayable delivery that left England rattled.With that spell, Akash Deep likely sealed his place for the Lord’s Test, showcasing masterful control with the new ball. Krishna didn’t take a wicket but played a valuable holding role from the other end.Jadeja was brought into the attack after the first hour and immediately started troubling the batters with turn from the rough. Unlike Headingley, Jadeja reduced his pace and extracted more spin — a smart tactical tweak. Both Stokes and Smith were tested, but the England captain managed to score some vital runs, hitting four boundaries off Siraj, including a classy pull and an extra cover drive.Realising the futility of defending endlessly, Stokes resorted to sweeping Jadeja. However, just as England seemed to be building a stand, Sundar's final over before lunch turned the momentum firmly back in India’s favour.Heading into Day 5, only two results were on the cards: an India win or a rain-assisted draw. England, who have drawn just one Test in the last three years, seemed to have abandoned any hopes of chasing the massive target.Now, with only four wickets standing and momentum on India’s side, a historic Edgbaston victory — and a series-levelling result — is within touching distance.","India need just four more wickets to seal their first-ever Test win at Edgbaston.

England squad for the third Test vs India

Reeling from a crushing 336-run defeat at Edgbaston, England have moved swiftly to bolster their bowling attack ahead of the third Test against India at Lord’s, starting Thursday, July 10.The England Men's selection panel has added Gus Atkinson, a right-arm fast bowler from Surrey, to the squad. The 27-year-old returns to the Test set-up after recovering from a hamstring injury sustained during England’s victory over Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge in May.His inclusion is seen as a direct response to England’s struggles with the ball in Birmingham, where India amassed a massive 587 in the first innings, led by Shubman Gill’s commanding 269. The English bowlers toiled as the visitors posted over 1000 runs across two innings, leaving skipper Ben Stokes visibly frustrated.""At 200/5 we were happy,"" Stokes said after the game. ""But we just weren’t able to blast them open. They ended up getting a big first innings total after us having a good start.""The new addition brings pace and proven domestic pedigree - with 55 wickets in just 12 matches at an average of 22.30, including best figures of 7/45.His return could also pave the way for a potential partnership with Jofra Archer, who trained with the squad in Birmingham and is being closely monitored ahead of a possible Test comeback after a four-year injury layoff.With the series level at 1-1, England may also consider resting Brydon Carse or Josh Tongue, both of whom have endured heavy workloads in the first two Tests.The squad shake-up reflects England’s urgency to regain momentum and recalibrate their bowling firepower as the series shifts to the iconic Lord’s Cricket Ground.Ben Duckett, Zak Crawley, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jamie Smith, Ben Stokes (c), Chris Woakes, Brydon Carse, Josh Tongue, Shoaib Bashir, Jofra Archer, Jamie Overton, Gus Atkinson, Jacob Bethell, Sam Cook.","England have added Surrey fast bowler Gus Atkinson to their squad.

'Any attack of ours can take 20 wickets anywhere': Shubman Gill hails Mohd Siraj, Akash Deep after historic Edgbaston win

Under the grey skies on a chilly Sunday, a young and vibrant Indian team generated enough steam to blow away England and complete a dominant 336-run win in the second Test. As captain Shubman Gill calmly pouched a skier to dismiss Brydon Carse off Akash Deep to complete India’s first ever win at Edgbaston, India’s young brigade announced to the world that they were more than just a side in transition, but a team capable of competing and winning against the best.It was apt that India’s top performers in the match, Gill and Akash Deep, were both involved in completing the proceedings. Gabba 2021 had been an indication of the resource pool in Indian cricket. The Edgbaston win has been a confirmation of their capabilities.With India’s premier pacer Jasprit Bumrah opting to sit out of the Test, and without the services of Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Ravichandran Ashwin, the next generation once again demonstrated it has more capability than the world assumed.On the eve of the Test, a member of the British media had asked India captain Shubman Gill if he had any idea why no Indian team had been able to win a Test here. Gill, maintaining his composure, said he believed he has got the team capable of doing so.It could have been the emotion taking over, but Gill was firm in sending a message that his team considered the defeat in the first Test at Headingley a lost opportunity. Having dominated nine of the first 10 days of cricket in this series, Gill would proudly say he wasn’t off the mark.After all, he led the way with two monumental knocks in the Test.Debates around the delayed declaration on Day Four evening got louder when the skies opened up as the teams arrived at the venue on the final day. With an hour and half of play lost, India were left with 80 overs to force a result.Akash Deep took the onus on himself to open the floodgates early on the day. He dished out a masterclass in seam bowling by returning figures of 6/99, to go with his four wickets in the first innings.Four overs into the day, Akash Deep got the ball to nip back off the seam to beat Ollie Pope’s defences and knock over the bails after the ball hit his elbow. Two overs later, he made first-innings centurion Harry Brook look like a novice when the ball jagged back off the seam to hit his back knee. Akash’s relentless attacking lines across both innings was reminiscent of the absent Mohammed Shami.Jamie Smith had to come out to bat at 83/5 after having launched a counter-attack at 84/5 in the first innings. However, his 99-ball 88 on Sunday was never going to threaten India’s attack. When Washington Sundar, the second spinner India brought in specifically for the second innings, rapped Ben Stokes in front at the stroke of lunch, England’s defiance was cut short.The target of 608 was too big for India to even feel threatened by Smith’s fluent strokeplay. His efforts only delayed the inevitable, with England eventually folding for 271.England had dared India to set any total for them to chase. By the last day, Gill and co had them fighting for survival. The Indian thinktank worked overtime to zero down on its combination for the second Test. They can argue it paid off. Now, they take Stokes’ men on at Lord’s in a few days’ time.",India beat England by 336 runs in the second Test at Edgbaston. Shubman Gill and Akash Deep were India’s top performers in the match.

Aaron Rodgers blames family for betrayal and shuts the door on reconciliation

Aaron Rodgers may be building a new chapter with his wife Brittani, but behind his high-profile life remains a longstanding emotional wound—one that still hasn’t healed. The NFL veteran's strained relationship with his family has been one of the sport's most talked-about yet mysterious personal stories. Now, new details have emerged shedding light on how close the Rodgers family came to reconciliation—only to drift apart again.In an exclusive interview with Us Weekly, Rodgers’ biographer Ian O’Connor revealed that a brief moment of hope occurred in the fall of 2024. “In the early fall of 2024, there were a couple of hopeful emails exchanged between Aaron and his parents,” O’Connor said. But that flicker of peace didn’t last. “By the end of the 2024 football season, the tone of their communication had changed and that cautious optimism about a potential reconciliation faded. ”This isn’t just a case of a football star avoiding family dinners. O’Connor explained that the estrangement spans over a decade and trickled down to Rodgers’ brothers, Luke and Jordan. At the heart of the family fracture was a deep divide over religion and personal values.Rodgers reportedly never connected with his parents’ evangelical faith, which they built their lives around in Chico, California. Instead, his worldview began to evolve during his college years at UC Berkeley.“Aaron questioned and challenged everything,” O’Connor noted. “He even questioned the role of his family in his life and came to believe that some family members were laying claim to his fortune and fame.” That belief system led to what O’Connor called “The Island,” where Rodgers isolates people he feels have violated his trust. “If you become a perceived obstacle in his path, you will be removed from his life,” he added.A brief moment of hope occurred in 2023 when Aaron saw his father, Ed, at a celebrity golf tournament and told him, “I love you.” But even that touching gesture wasn’t enough to rebuild a bridge.Most tellingly, during a June 2025 interview on ESPN’s The Pat McAfee Show, Rodgers made it clear where things stood: “I don’t talk to” his family. “They wouldn’t know any information about me.”Also Read: Will Donald Trump become the unlikely savior of the Washington Commanders’ stadium comeback?

Jack Eichel’s impact and value to the Golden Knights cannot be overstated

While the Vegas Golden Knights made waves this offseason by acquiring Mitch Marner in a blockbuster sign-and-trade, the franchise is quietly working on another crucial piece of business—securing Jack Eichel’s future with the team.Jack Eichel, the star center who helped deliver Vegas its first Stanley Cup in 2023, officially became eligible for a contract extension on July 1. According to The Fourth Period’s David Pagnotta, negotiations are already underway. “Speaking of Vegas, the Golden Knights have started contract negotiations with Jack Eichel on an extension,” Pagnotta reported, signaling the team’s clear intention to lock down their franchise cornerstone before he hits free agency.The 28-year-old center is coming off a career-best season, notching a franchise-record 94 points in just 77 regular-season games. His elite two-way play, leadership, and postseason pedigree have made him one of the most important players on Vegas’s roster since arriving via trade from Buffalo in November 2021.Though Marner currently holds the title of highest-paid Golden Knight with a $12 million annual cap hit, Eichel’s new deal could surpass that, as noted by team insider Danny Webster.“Jack Eichel is now eligible for an 8-year contract extension to make him the highest-paid player in Golden Knights history,” Webster posted on July 1.Bringing in Marner was a major swing for Vegas, but retaining Eichel would send a message that the organization is not just chasing headlines—it’s building for long-term success. With Eichel set to become an unrestricted free agent in 2026, this extension window provides a vital opportunity for the Golden Knights to solidify their core before any uncertainty takes hold.Also Read: NHL Predictions: 3-time All-Star Ryan Suter likely to retire as market interest fades in offseason Eichel’s continued presence ensures that Vegas remains a serious Stanley Cup contender in the years to come.

The team’s strong medical staff and recent health record make them a viable option for the veteran guard’s rehabilitation.As The Daily News noted: “The Knicks were the healthiest team in all of basketball last season. Damian Lillard needs somewhere to rehab...

Despite a successful outing at the National Games in Dehradun early this year, Animesh Kujur wasn’t a happy man. That’s because he wasn’t just aiming for a win there, he was also eyeing records and better timings and had pushed himself day in and day out to make sure he could do that. Although he didn’t succeed then, it’s finally happening.First he broke the 200m national record during the final of the Asian Athletics Championships on May 31 when he ran a time of 20.32 seconds to grab a silver medal.On Saturday night at the Dromia International Sprint and Relays Meeting at Konstantinos Baglatzis Municipal Stadium in Vari, Greece, he shattered the 100m national record by crossing the finish line in 10.18 seconds.Animesh, who trains at the Odisha Reliance Foundation Athletics High-Performance Centre (HPC) at Kalinga Stadium, bettered Gurindervir Singh’s timing of 10.20 seconds set during the Indian Grand Prix 1 at Netaji Subhas Southern Centre of the Sports Authority of India (SAI) in Bengaluru in March.He told TOI in an exclusive interview, “I have to compete with faster athletes. In India, there aren’t many competitors like that.But I have the scope of training abroad and running with athletes who have timings close to 10 seconds. That is how I will be able to measure where I stand.”With more events coming up, one expects him to run even faster in his quest to breach the 10-second barrier, which James Hiller, athletics director with Reliance Foundation, believes is quite possible. “I get asked a lot, can an Indian break 10 seconds? And they can,” said Hiller. “I think positive mindset will help the sprinters genuinely believe that they can be faster and they can run under 10 seconds.”",Animesh Kujur broke the 100m national record by crossing the finish line in 10.18 seconds.

'Any attack of ours can take 20 wickets anywhere': Shubman Gill hails Mohd Siraj, Akash Deep after historic Edgbaston win

Akash Deep tends to get excited at the prospect of representing the country and playing on the biggest stage, getting to run in and bowl at venues he has only heard of in stories while growing up.Last Sept, ahead of a Test match against Bangladesh, he said he was thrilled to be playing a match at Green Park in Kanpur, since it was the first stadium he had ever heard of. Similarly, he had pre-conceived notions about traditional bowling conditions here in England.“I’d imagined that I’d get conditions where the ball swings and seams,” Akash had said after his four-wicket haul in the first innings here at Edgbaston.Hailing from a small town in Bihar , Akash Deep sure has come a long way. On Sunday, when proceedings began after lunch on Day 5, the announcer at the ground mentioned Akash by name. Immediately, the Indian fans — who comfortably outnumbered the England supporters — started chanting his name wildly.After his match-winning 10-wicket haul in the second Test, the humble, small-town boy is the toast of Indian cricket at one of the most celebrated venues in the world.Perhaps Akash Deep’s humility is what helps him stay flexible and be effective in varied conditions. “The coaches have always encouraged me. They tell me that even I don’t realise the things I am capable of,” Akash said.When he found out that conditions in England this summer didn’t exactly resemble the stories, Akash Deep immediately decided to stick to his natural lines and lengths. He has enough miles in his legs at the domestic level and that showed as he ran in tirelessly, seamlessly, in both innings here.“I trusted my experience and stuck to the line and lengths that I bowled in India. On these kinds of pitches, you need to be disciplined.,” Akash said.He consistently out-bowled everyone on this relatively docile Edgbaston track and kept coming at the batters. It’s remarkable considering he was off-colour in the IPL following a side injury and subsequently carried a niggle while travelling with the India ‘A’ team preceding this Test series.“Akash is an attacking bowler who asks questions by bowling at the stumps a lot. That’s one of the golden rules here in England. Coming back from injury and seeing him running in and bowling at a high pace is a a nice sign for us,” India’s bowling coach Morne Morkel said after Akash Deep produced a dream spell to get rid of the in-form Ben Duckett and Joe Root late on the fourth day on Saturday.Not surprisingly, he got the ball rolling immediately on the final morning by knocking over Ollie Pope , followed by trapping Harry Brook in front of the stumps with balls that jagged back remarkably off the seam.For now, Akash Deep is on a roll. India will be hoping for more such performances from him in this series.",Akash Deep is the toast of Indian cricket at one of the most celebrated venues in the world.

Matt Hardy talks about his blocked AEW appearance

Is CM Punk A Hypocrite For WWE Night Of Champions In Saudi Arabia?

Matt Hardy reflects on CM Punk’s Saudi Arabia controversy

WWE veteran Matt Hardy alleges CM Punk stopped the former’s AEW Collision appearance. CM Punk restarted his wrestling career with AEW in 2021. The Wrestler stayed with the promotion for 2 years. He developed a good relationship with the founder, Tony Khan. Hardy claims that Punk might be involved in the former’s failed appearance at AEW Collision.In a recent episode of The Extreme Life of Matt Hardy, the wrestler made a bold statement. Hardy was supposed to appear on AEW Collision. He was in talks with the promoter Tony Khan just a day before the event.“I talk with Tony, and Tony’s like, ‘Yes, I want you tomorrow, be out in the corner with Ethan. I definitely want you there,'” Hardy stated how his appearance was later cancelled, “They say, ‘Just heard that you’re not needed for tomorrow’s event.’”The wrestler is not sure of what went down. However, he believed that The Best in the World had a role in it. Punk had a good reputation within AEW. Khan even held the wrestler in high regard. Reflecting on this, Hardy stated, “Someone stopped [my appearance on AEW Collision] from happening, and I couldn’t imagine it as someone besides Punk, because Punk was going to be there.That was his show, right? I don’t know that for a fact, just spitting it out there. ”Matt Hardy and CM Punk shared a relationship full of ups and downs. The duo shared the same team during the WWE Survivor Series 2006. Hardy, in one of his podcast episodes, even talked about the relationship between him and the Best in the World. Hardy stated that he had no issues with Punk.CM Punk issued an apology on his controversial Saudi Arabia statement. The apology came in before the Night of Champions kicked off. Punk made a statement at The Miz in 2019. He had said, “Go s*ck a Blood Money-covered d**k in Saudi Arabia.” Even though the wrestler issued the apology, he was criticised for the comment.Reflecting on the statement, Hardy stated in the same podcast, “He’s an employee, he has a job. He’s one of the top guys, one of the top acts in WWE, and they wanted him to do that, and that was, like, his job requirement,” the wrestler continued. “It’s one of those things, especially if you’re trying to be a good employee. Even if something you don’t want to do, you have to know you’re going to take a hit in it.”Also Read: Former NXT Women's North American Champion Announces Engagement With Fellow WWE Star",WWE veteran Matt Hardy alleges CM Punk stopped the former’s AEW Collision appearance.

Poll Should England change their strategy to tackle India's bowling attack? Yes, they need to be more aggressive. No, they should stick to their plan.

TimesofIndia.com in Birmingham: England batting coach Marcus Trescothick admitted that India’s second-innings declaration exceeded expectations, calling the 608-run target “a hell lot of runs” after a punishing fourth day of the second Test at Edgbaston.“We are not naive enough to know that it’s a challenging total,” Trescothick told reporters after stumps. “I expected India to set 550-run target, but it is what it is. They make their own decisions.”India declared their second innings at 427 for six, riding on Shubman Gill’s superb 161 and strong contributions from KL Rahul (55), Rishabh Pant (65), and Ravindra Jadeja (69 not out).That gave them a mammoth lead of 607 runs after dismissing England for 407 in the first innings.England were left facing an uphill task on a deteriorating Day Four surface, and their top order wobbled almost immediately under pressure.ak Crawley fell for a duck in the second over to Mohammed Siraj, while Akash Deep, continuing his impressive bowling in English conditions, removed Ben Duckett (25) and Joe Root (6).At stumps, England were 72 for three in 16 overs, still needing 536 runs with only Ollie Pope (24 not out) and Harry Brook (15 not out) at the crease.India now head into the final day with momentum fully on their side and three crucial wickets already in the bag.With full sessions likely on Day Five, India will be eyeing a series-levelling win, while England must attempt what would be the highest successful chase in Test history.","India declared their second innings at 427 for six, riding on Shubman Gill’s superb 161 and strong contributions from KL Rahul (55), Rishabh Pant (65), and Ravindra Jadeja (69 not out) That gave them a mammoth lead of 607 runs after dismissing England for 407 in the first innings.

In the first half of the March 3 game against the Sacramento Kings, Kyrie Irving , the star guard for the Dallas Mavericks, tore his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). On March 26, he had a successful surgery. Now, he recently addressed his recovery, tempering expectations about returning during the playoffs. He further said that he is currently solely focusing on getting recovered from the injury.Despite early reports that Kyrie Irving might return by January 2026, the Dallas Mavericks have been growing more optimistic about his development in recent weeks. Kyrie Irving, however, clarified that he is more concerned with his complete recovery than with any timetable.ESPN’s Shams Charania estimated that the icon might return somewhere in between December and after the NBA’s 2026 All-Star break in late February or early March. The general estimate for most returns from ACL tears is around a year from the initial injury, hence the March estimation.However, it wasn't until Kyrie Irving himself recently answered questions about it during a live stream. When asked about when he would return, he gave a straightforward response saying:“Don’t hold your breath on that… it doesn’t mean that I won’t be back, it’s that I don’t want to make any predictions on when I’m going to be back.I just want to be back 150,000% better. So I’m taking my time right now to really get healthy. I’m taking my time to really get my body right, get other portions of my body right, and really just enjoy the is recovery process. It’s not pretty. Yes, it’s a beautiful struggle but I go through the mental roller coaster ride every day, just wanting to be back out there. ”The 33-year-old further highlighted the mental and physical difficulties associated with recovery. He also referred to the process as a ""beautiful struggle” as he acknowledged the challenges of being sidelined while his teammates continue their playoff drive. On the other hand, the Dallas Mavericks think that their core is still competitive enough to compete in the Western Conference.Kyrie Irving, on the other hand, is only concerned with getting better for the time being. He was shooting more than 40 percent from three-point range and averaging 24.7 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game before the injury. However, now he is just focusing on his healing journey.Also read: Kyrie Irving lands $119 million deal to stay with Dallas Mavericks after ditching player option","Kyrie Irving tore his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) on March 3.

Insider warns Leafs can’t afford to wait while the trade market heats up

The Toronto Maple Leafs are officially on the clock. After trading away star winger Mitch Marner in a blockbuster sign-and-trade with the Vegas Golden Knights, the Leafs are scrambling to fill the massive void left by his departure—and time is quickly running out.T oronto entered free agency eyeing top-six replacements but came up short on several key targets. Both Nikolaj Ehlers and Brock Boeser—widely viewed as ideal candidates to slot alongside Auston Matthews—opted to sign elsewhere, despite Toronto’s competitive offers. Ehlers landed with the Hurricanes on a six-year, $51 million deal, while Boeser stayed loyal to Vancouver, rejecting more money from the Leafs.TSN’s Mike DiStefano didn’t sugarcoat the urgency surrounding the situation. “Obviously, that’s a big hole, right, for the Maple Leafs, and they’ve got to fill that Mitch Marner hole,” DiStefano said on OverDrive. He acknowledged that while Matias Maccelli—one of Toronto’s recent additions—has potential, “That’s not gonna replace 100 points. That’s not gonna replace your top penalty killer, the guy who controls your power play.With few high-end wingers remaining on the open market, DiStefano believes General Manager Brad Treliving must now shift focus to the trade market. “I’m curious to see what Brad Treliving has up his sleeve to make that placement,” he added.So far, the return for Marner—center Nicolas Roy—is underwhelming when measured against the superstar’s production. Roy notched 31 points last season and is unlikely to provide the scoring punch Toronto urgently needs. Meanwhile, the team still has $4.9 million in cap space, but that figure may not be enough to land the kind of impact player they need without making further roster moves.Also Read: NHL Contract Extension: Golden Knights begin talks to make Jack Eichel highest-paid player in franchise history If the Leafs want to stay competitive in the Eastern Conference and keep Matthews in championship contention mode, the front office must act decisively—and soon.

Eyewitnesses noted her laughing and touching his arm, sparking rumors of a new romantic chapter.While the couple split after nearly a decade together, a source revealed that, “Dakota held a flame for them to be together because she loved him so much and loved his kids so much.” The insider added that her mother, Melanie Griffith, is reportedly trying to salvage the relationship, believing Dakota is “making a huge mistake” by letting it go.Brady, enjoying life post-retirement, showed off his sculpted physique in black swim trunks and a dark green cap.

A composed chase led by Andries Gous and an excellent spell from Glenn Maxwell powered Washington Freedom to a six-wicket win over MI New York, sealing a top-two finish and a berth in Qualifier 1 of the 2025 Major League Cricket (MLC).Despite the defeat, MI New York also advanced to the playoffs, their vastly superior Net Run Rate keeping them ahead of the Seattle Orcas.After choosing to bat in a rain-affected match that was reduced to 18 overs per side, MI New York’s reshuffled lineup struggled for fluency. Monank Patel fell early, and Nicholas Pooran’s quickfire start — including two crisp boundaries — ended abruptly. First, Glenn Maxwell struck twice in a burst, and Glenn Phillips followed suit with a double-wicket over of his own. The pitch assisted spin with turn and variable bounce, and Washington’s attack used it to full effect.Amid the collapse, debutant Kunwarjeet Singh impressed with a composed 33 on his T20 debut, showcasing maturity against spin. But once he fell to Phillips, the innings lost steam. Sunny Patel and Heath Richards added some lower-order resistance, guiding MI New York past 100 to finish on 112/8. Maxwell returned figures of 3/29, while Phillips was tidy and incisive with 2/4 in his only over.Washington’s chase began with the early loss of Mitch Owen, and Rachin Ravindra’s departure followed soon after. But Mark Chapman’s brisk 27 off 18 balls settled nerves. Though he and Maxwell fell in quick succession, Gous took command, striking three boundaries in the 14th over to break the back of the chase. He remained unbeaten on 46 from 34 balls, calmly steering his team home with 18 balls to spare.For Washington, the win ensured a top-two finish and a direct path to Qualifier 1 — a reward for consistent performances throughout the season. MI New York, meanwhile, completed the league stage in fourth place, their playoff hopes never really threatened due to a healthy NRR cushion over the Orcas. Their selection experiment may not have earned them a win, but it offered valuable exposure to help strengthen the bench heading into the playoff games.112/8 in 18 overs (Kunwarjeet Singh 33, Sunny Patel 16, Heath Richards 16; Glenn Maxwell 3/29, Glenn Phillips 2/4)113/4 in 15 overs (Andries Gous 46*, Mark Chapman 27, Glenn Phillips 14; Tristan Luus 2/39)","Washington Freedom beat MI New York by six wickets.
