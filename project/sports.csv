NEW DELHI: In a thrilling IPL 2024 match at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Bhuvneshwar Kumar's nerve-wracking performance secured a 1-run victory for Sunrisers Hyderabad against Rajasthan Royals. Despite facing adversity, SRH pulled off a remarkable comeback to clinch the win when defeat seemed imminent.Rajasthan holds 16 points from 10 matches, with 4 games remaining.Sunrisers Hyderabad's victory, by just one run against Rajasthan, has propelled them to the fourth spot, pushing Chennai Super Kings down to fifth place.In the 50th IPL 2024 clash, Sunrisers Hyderabad faced Rajasthan Royals. SRH struggled early on but Travis Head and Nitish Reddy's partnership of 96 off 57 balls revived their innings, with Heinrich Klaasen's unbeaten 42 providing the final push.Despite losing two wickets in the first over, Rajasthan's Riyan Parag (77) and opener Yashasvi Jaiswal (67) built a strong 133-run stand. Yet, Sunrisers' bowlers fought back fiercely, clinching a thrilling win on the last ball. Parag's impressive 77 propelled him to the fourth spot in the IPL 2024 Orange Cap list, tallying 409 runs.In the 50th IPL 2024 clash between SRH and RR, T Natarajan clinched two vital wickets, catapulting him to the top of the IPL 2024 Purple Cap race, overtaking MI's Jasprit Bumrah. Natarajan boasts 15 wickets in 8 matches, while Bumrah has 14 wickets in 10 matches. Meanwhile, Yuzvendra Chahal had a tough outing, failing to take any wickets and conceding 62 runs in his four overs.Following Natarajan and Bumrah are Mustafizur Rahman and Harshal Patel, both with 14 wickets each. Bumrah leads them in the Purple Cap race due to his superior economy and average. Matheesha Pathirana closely follows with 13 wickets in 6 matches, currently occupying the fifth position.",The IPL 2024 Orange cap is the most expensive cap in the world. The cap costs an estimated $1.5 million per cap.

NEW DELHI: In Chennai Super Kings' commanding 78-run victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad, Tushar Deshpande's sensational bowling performance during the powerplay proved to be the game-changer. Ruturaj Gaikwad, the skipper, recognized Deshpande's pivotal role in shifting the momentum back in their favour, a momentum that had been elusive throughout the season.Deshpande's wholehearted effort reflected in his figures of 4/27 off three overs. Particularly impactful were his three wickets during the powerplay, which dismantled the formidable Sunrisers Hyderabad batting order, led by Travis Head.In terms of individual performances for IPL 2024 Purple Cap list, Mustafizur Rahman's exceptional bowling performance saw him claim two wickets, elevating him to the second position in the IPL Purple Cap List. Rahman now has 14 wickets in 8 innings, tying with Purple Cap leader Jasprit Bumrah of Mumbai Indians, who has taken 14 wickets in 9 innings. However, Bumrah retains the top spot due to his superior economy and average.Also See:Harshal Patel of Punjab Kings follows closely behind in third place in the Purple Cap race, also with 14 wickets in 9 innings, but his economy and average are not as impressive as Bumrah and Rahman's. Matheesha Pathirana of CSK also had a noteworthy performance in the match, claiming two wickets, bringing his total to 13 wickets in 6 innings, securing him the fourth spot on the purple cap list. T Natarajan is in fifth place, having taken 13 wickets in 7 innings, including the crucial dismissal of Ruturaj Gaikwad for 98.In the upcoming match between Mumbai Indians and Lucknow Super Giants, Jasprit Bumrah's track record against key LSG batsmen is notable. He has dismissed K.L. Rahul, Nicholas Pooran, and Devdutt Padikkal twice each in previous encounters. This statistic adds an interesting dimension to the contest between Bumrah and the LSG batting lineup.",The IPL Purple Cap 2024 will be the largest in the history of the Indian Premier League. The cap will be worth an estimated $1.2 billion. It is the largest cap in the league's history. It will also be the most expensive in the world.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109681945,imgsize-59894,width-400,resizemode-4/109681945.jpg"

Virat Kohli , who had lost the Orange Cap as IPL 2024 's top scorer to Chennai Super Kings' captain Ruturaj Gaikwad earlier this week, reclaimed it with his 42-run knock for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in their victory over Gujarat Titans in Bengaluru on Saturday. But it was not just his breezy knock but also his cheeky gesture after receiving the cap from teammate Dinesh Karthik that broke the internet.Kohli's 42 came off just 27 balls at a strike rate of 155.56, while he put up an opening partnership of 92 runs with RCB skipper and top-scorer Faf du PLessis who struck a sublime 23-ball 62, which included 10 four and 3 sixes.However, RCB's middle order caved in against Joshua Litle (4/42) while chasing Gujarat Titans's below-par 147.But the Kohli-Du Plessis partnership had done enough damage at the top, as veteran finisher Karthik (21* off 12 balls) and Swapil Singh (15* off 9) took the team home in 13.4 overs for a four-wicket win.Kohli's knock took him past Gaikwad in the Orange Cap standings CSK's Gaikwad was nine runs ahead before the start of Friday's match. Kohli now has 542 runs in 11 matches so far this season.After the game, Kohli received the Orange Cap from Karthik, who put it on Virat's head. In a cheeky gesture, Kohli bowed to Karthik after receiving it, as both smiled.RCB bowlers, led by two wickets each from Yash Dayal, Vijaykumar Vyshak and Mohammed Siraj, bowled out Gujarat Titans for just 147 after the hosts won the toss and opted to bowl first.The victory took RCB to the seventh spot in the points table, but their chances of reaching the playoffs continue to hang by a thread.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Gujarat Titans by four wickets.

Rohit Sharma's 20:20 spin vision: Indian skipper says he wanted four tweakers in T20 World Cup squad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/rohit-sharmas-2020-spin-vision-indian-skipper-says-he-wanted-four-tweakers-in-t20-world-cup-squad/articleshow/109800346.cms,"India's games start at 10 AM and dew will not play a major role

Dube for middle-order power

'In IPL, performances change daily'

MUMBAI: Keeping in mind the conditions in the Caribbean, where the wickets are likely to be low, slow and sluggish, the unusually early start timings for India's matches - 10 am local time - and perhaps also the ordinary form of their pacers barring Jasprit Bumrah , India have clearly devised a bowling plan for the upcoming T20 World Cup based around a heavy diet of spin.While Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel are the left-arm spinning allrounders in the squad, Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal are the two wrist spinners. On Thursday, captain Rohit Sharma , while trying to avoid giving out too much in terms of team strategy, justified the logic of having picked four spinners and just three pacers in the 15-member squad.""I don't want to go too much into details. I'm sure opposition captains are listening to this. I wanted four spinners. We've played a lot of cricket there (Caribbean). We know what the conditions are like. With a morning start at 10-10.30am, there's a little bit of technical aspect involved in this,"" Rohit said.""The reason for picking four spinners is something I won't reveal now. I wanted four spinners. With two of them being allrounders (Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja) and two attacking options (Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal), it gives you balance. Based on the opposition, we can decide who to play,"" the captain stressed.""Maybe when I do the first press conference upon landing, I'll give more details,"" he added.After India's failures in the last two T20 World Cups, it's clear that Rohit and the selectors wanted someone to do the heavy lifting in the middle overs against spinners, where acceleration has been a big problem.In that aspect, the skipper is banking on Mumbai allrounder Shivam Dube, who has been in sizzling form for the Chennai Super Kings in the last three IPLs now and has shown the ability to tonk the spinners.In the IPL so far, Dube has smashed 350 runs in 10 matches at a strike rate of 171.56 (average 50.00), in a tally which includes 26 sixes. In the three-match T20I series against Afghanistan at home in January, he carted 124 runs in three innings at a strike-rate of 158.97.""The one thing we really looked at was middle-overs hitting. The top-order hitting has been alright, hasn't been bad, but there are options there as well. In the middle overs, we wanted someone to come and play that role where he can play freely without worrying about who is bowling and who is not. We picked Shivam Dube based on the IPL and a few games before the IPL as well,"" Rohit said.The Indian captain expects Dube to chip in with the ball too, even though he has bowled just one over in this IPL. ""I know Shivam has not bowled much, but he's a seasoned cricketer who bowls a lot of overs in red-ball cricket. If we need Shivam to bowl a few overs, he will bowl. Hardik as well.""Rohit revealed that he had ""70-80%"" of India's World Cup-bound squad in his mind before the IPL.""You make the playing XI in your mind and work around it. The talk of what our final 15 started much before the IPL. In the IPL, performances change every day. Anyone will come and score a hundred or take five wickets.""",India's games start at 10 am local time and dew will not play a major role.

NEW DELHI: Indian men's and women's 4x400m relay teams secured their spots for the Paris Olympics after impressive performances at the World Athletics Relays on Monday.The women's quartet, consisting of Rupal Chaudhary, M R Poovamma, Jyothika Sri Dandi, and Subha Venkatesan, clocked a time of 3 minutes and 29.35 seconds, finishing second behind Jamaica (3:28.54) in their heat.This result ensured their qualification for the upcoming Olympic Games.Similarly, the men's squad, comprising Muhammed Anas Yahiya, Muhammed Ajmal, Arokia Rajiv, and Amoj Jacob, also finished second in their heat with a time of 3 minutes and 3.23 seconds, trailing behind the USA (2:59.95). The top two teams in each of the three heats in the second round were granted automatic qualification for the Paris Olympics, scheduled to take place from July 26 to August 11.The Indian women's team had previously finished fifth in the first-round qualifying heat on Sunday, clocking a time of 3 minutes and 29.74 seconds. Unfortunately, the men's team was unable to finish their first-round qualifying heat due to second leg runner Rajesh Ramesh pulling out midway as a result of cramps.With the successful qualification of the men's and women's 4x400m relay teams, India now boasts a total of 19 track and field athletes who have secured their spots for the Paris Olympics.This list includes the reigning javelin throw champion, Neeraj Chopra , among other talented athletes.

Chelsea thrash West Ham United 5-0 to reignite dreams for European participation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/chelsea-thrash-west-ham-united-5-0-to-reignite-dreams-for-european-participation/articleshow/109869842.cms,"(Inputs from Reuters)

NEW DELHI: Chelsea significantly improved their prospects of participating in European competitions in the upcoming season by delivering a resounding 5-0 victory against West Ham in the Premier League on Sunday. The goals were scored by Cole Palmer , Conor Gallagher , Noni Madueke , and Nicolas Jackson , who netted twice.Palmer, aged 21, capitalized on a loose ball following a cross from Madueke in the 15th minute and precisely placed his shot into the far corner, beyond the reach of West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola.It marked his 21st league goal in his maiden season with the London club.Gallagher, the team captain, also took advantage of a loose ball in the penalty area after a tackle on Madueke and emphatically converted his opportunity on the half-hour mark, exposing the disorganization in West Ham's defence.Madueke transitioned from assisting to scoring, and back again, on either side of the halftime break. He scored from close range in the 36th minute following a corner kick and then set up Jackson for Chelsea's fourth goal in the 48th minute.Jackson added his second goal of the match 10 minutes from the end, latching onto a long pass from Moises Caicedo and remaining onside, as confirmed by a VAR review.The outcome propelled Chelsea to seventh place in the league table, surpassing Manchester United , who have a match scheduled for Monday. This victory positions Chelsea within reach of qualifying for the Europa League next season.","Chelsea thrash West Ham 5-0 in the Premier League on Sunday.

IPL: Rohit Sharma's form a concern for India and Mumbai Indians ahead of Sunrisers Hyderabad clash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-rock-bottom-mumbai-indians-face-sunrisers-hyderabad/articleshow/109869564.cms,"MUMBAI: In an IPL where arguments and counterarguments about Virat Kohli’s strike rate have hogged the limelight, the patchy form of Team India captain Rohit Sharma has flown under the radar.Going into the T20 World Cup next month, Rohit is aware that he could do with some runs and time in the middle under his belt, starting with Monday night's tie for the Mumbai Indians against Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Wankhede Stadium.When he was removed from MI captaincy before this season, head coach Mark Boucher had hoped that the decision would allow Rohit, who was in fine touch going into IPL, to ""play more freely and take his team to the playoffs.""However, things haven't exactly panned out the same way for the man who led MI to five IPL titles, but whose IPL form has been a concern for a few years now owing to his tendency to be over-aggressive from ball one.Since he slammed a century (105 not out off 63 balls) — his first in the IPL in more than a decade — against the Chennai Super Kings at the Wankhede Stadium on April 14 in a 20-run defeat — Rohit's scores have been 36, 6, 8, 4 and 11. Before that, his sequence of scores in the tournament read 43, 26, 0, 49 & 38. Overall, the 37-year-old has managed 326 runs in 11 matches@32.60 so far in IPL-2024.In his last match against Kolkata Knight Riders, Rohit didn't even field due to a mild back issue and only came to bat as an ‘Impact Player.'There is a fair chance that given that the T20 World Cup is around the corner, the veteran opener would again turn out for MI as an ‘Impact Player'- ironic since he himself has been critical of the rule!At the selection presser, India's chief selector Ajit Agarkar had made it clear that his committee pitched in for ""experience"" while picking the World Cup-bound squad, but Rohit's poor IPL form does present a concern.If Rohit finds his form, it will help MI, down and knocked out of the competition, salvage some of their battered pride. Although they lost their first eight matches on the trot in 2022, this somehow feels the worst season for MI in their history.

Head's contest with Bumrah has the potential to light up this game.

They have 16 points, the same as Rajasthan Royals but have played one game more.LSG, on the other hand, dropped out of the top four to the fifth spot with 12 points from 11 games. Their Net Run Rate also took a massive hit going down from 0.094 to -0.371.Earlier, the in-form Narine, who was dropped twice in the space of two balls, smoked five boundaries in five balls, setting the tone for the KKR innings.First, he hammered back-to-back fours off Naveen-ul-Haq in the last two balls of the third over. He then attacked the offside, hitting three boundaries on the trot off Mohsin Khan in the fourth over.Narine and Phil Salt (32) gave the two-time champions the explosive start they have come to expect from the duo. Together they put up a quick 61-run stand before Naveen-ul Haq took the pace off the ball to send the Englishman packing.Medium pacer Yash Thakur then stemmed the flow of runs in the final over of the powerplay, giving away only two runs as KKR reached 70/1.However, the unperturbed Narine continued his onslaught and brought up his fifty off 27 deliveries with a cheeky late dab that sent the ball rolling past short third.He took a particular liking to Marcus Stoinis, sending the ball over the fence three times in the 11th over.But Ravi Bishnoi, on whose bowling Narine was dropped twice before, was third time lucky as he put an end to the all-rounder's spectacular innings.The LSG bowlers were able to rein in the KKR batters as they kept taking wickets.Naveen-ul Haq got rid of Andre Russell (12) before Yudhvir Singh, who came as a concussion sub for Mohsin Khan, picked up young Angkrish Raghuvanshi's (32) wicket in the next over.The Afghan pacer swung back into action to account for the big-hitting Rinku Singh (16) while Thakur removed Shreyas Iyer (23).But Ramandeep Singh's unbeaten 25 off 6 balls took KKR past the 230-run mark.(With inputs from PTI)","Kolkata Knight Riders beat Lucknow Super Giants by 98 runs in IPL.

GAVASKAR'S RESPONSE

HOW THE FANS HAVE REACTED

After Sunil Gavaskar 's scathing response to fellow batting legend Virat Kohli for his comment on cricket experts debating his strike rate in T20s, fans came out in huge numbers on social media to voice their opinion on the controversy.Prior to the announcement of India's squad for the T20 World Cup , there were talks about Kohli not scoring quickly enough to match the standards of T20 strike rate these days despite the Royal Challengers Bengaluru icon topping the list of run-getters in the ongoing Indian Premier League Season.But Kohli remained in almost ever expert's list of India's 15-member T20 World Cup squad and also made it to the official squad announced by the BCCI earlier in the week.Kohli, who has scored 542 runs in 11 matches so far in IPL 2024 , reacted to the comments.""Not really, all the people who talk about strike-rates and me not playing spin well are the ones talking about this stuff. For me, it's about winning the games for the team and there's a reason why you've done it for 15 years, you've done this day in and day out, you've won games for your teams, I'm not quite sure that if you haven't been in that situation yourself, to sit and talk about the game in the box.""""For me, people can talk about their assumptions day in and day out, but those who have done it day in and day out, they know what's happening and it's a kind of muscle memory for me now.""""Commentators questioned only when his strike rate was 118. I'm not too sure. I don't watch too many matches, so I don't know what the other commentators have said otherwise. But if you come and open and then have a strike of 118 when you get out in the 14th or the 15th over, I mean, if you want applause for that, that's a little bit different.""""All these guys talk about, 'oh we don't care about outside noise'. Accha! Then why are you replying to any outside noise or whatever it is? We all played a bit of cricket, not a lot of cricket. We don't have agendas. We speak about what we see. We don't necessarily have any likes and dislikes. Even if we have likes and dislikes, we actually speak on what is happening.""""I hope Star Sports realises that when that clip is shown, questioning the critics, the critics are your own commentators. For you to show the person belittling your own commentators, I'm not sure that's a great thing. You need to realise you have shown it enough times, everybody's got the message.

Du Plessis, in particular, showcased his aggressive intent, smashing the ball to all corners and registering the franchise's second-fastest fifty off 18 balls against Gujarat Titans in the IPL match in Bengaluru.While du Plessis took on the aggressor role, Kohli provided crucial support, resulting in their highest Powerplay score of 92 in the history of the IPL.However, a dramatic turn of events saw Bengaluru lose momentum, slipping from 92/1 to 111/5. Kohli, undeterred by the falling wickets, anchored the innings, losing partners but holding one end firmly.Dinesh Karthik 's arrival provided much-needed support, and despite Kohli's dismissal, Karthik kept his calm and targeted Rashid Khan to get things back under control.With Swapnil Singh also contributing crucial runs, Bengaluru's resilience shone through as they successfully chased down the 147-run target with 38 balls to spare, showcasing the team's depth and determination in overcoming adversity.Veteran RCB batter Karthik, who hadn't thought of coming to bat with the way their openers started the chase, gave full credit to Kohli and du Plessis for the four-wicket victory over Gujarat Titans.""I started with a cup of tea, then after four overs I had a cappuccino and thought I wouldn't be batting.""

And with India's back to the wall and a job at stake, coach Igor Stimac finally opened the doors for Indian talents in I-League to be included in the national team squad.On Saturday, the head coach announced the first list of probables for June's crucial World Cup qualifiers and it included four players - three of whom are from Mizoram - from the erstwhile top-division league that had lost its relevance in India team selection under the Croatian.With the job at hand being guiding India to end as one of the top two teams in Group A, Mohammedan SC's Indian top scorer David Lalhlansanga, Aizawl FC striker Lalrinzuala Lalbiaknia, Inter Kashi midfielder Edmund Lalrindika and Real Kashmir defender Muhammad Hammad were called for the four-week camp in Bhubaneswar starting on Friday.Former Aizawl FC forward Lalhlansanga, who played a vital role in Mohammedan's stupendous run to I-League title this season, scored five goals with two assists in 22 appearances for the champions this season.The 22-year-old's state-mate and an attacker in his former club, Lalrinzuala created history by becoming the highest Indian goal-scorer in I-League with 15 goals and broke the record held by his idol Sunil Chhetri and Mohammed Rafi .Meanwhile, 25-year-old playmaker Lalrindika had a productive season for debutants Inter Kashi, scoring four and providing eight assists.With veteran defender Sandesh Jhingan missing the vital qualifiers with injury, Real Kashmir centre-back Hummad could be an important addition to realise India's dreams.Stimac's commitment to finding recruits in the attacking department was also proved by the inclusion of four new faces to accompany veteran Sunil Chhetri and Rahim Ali as India's strike force.The northeast's continuing role as supply line saw one more player from the seven states to join the three debutants from Mizoram as Assam and NorthEast United FC 's Parthib Gogoi got a chance to prove his mettle after a couple of top-class goals in Indian Super League .His NEUFC teammate Jithin MS, too, was gifted with an opportunity for his four goals and three assists as Stimac looked to have paid heed to his critics with an interesting list of young new faces with dreams to shine for India.A final list is expected after Indian Super League final on Saturday with players from the finalists club missing from the first list of probables that will take on Kuwait in Kolkata on June 6 before travelling to face Qatar in Doha on June 11.The squad: Goalkeepers: Amrinder Singh, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu; Defenders: Amey Ganesh Ranawade, Jay Gupta, Lalchungnunga, Muhammad Hammad, Narender, Nikhil Poojary, Roshan Singh Naorem; Midfielders: Brandon Fernandes, Edmund Lalrindika, Imran Khan, Isak Vanlalruatfela, Jeakson Singh Thounaojam, Mahesh Singh Naorem, Mohammad Yasir, Nandhakumar Sekar, Rahul Kannoly Praveen, Suresh Singh Wangjam, Vibin Mohanan; Forwards: David Lalhlansanga, Jithin Madathil Subran, Lalrinzuala, Parthib Sundar Gogoi, Rahim Ali, Sunil Chhetri","Mohammedan SC's Indian top scorer David Lalhlansanga, Aizawl FC striker Lalrinzuala Lalbiaknia, Inter Kashi midfielder Edmund Lalrindika and Real Kashmir defender Muhammad Hammad called for the four-week camp in Bhubaneswar starting on Friday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109852202,imgsize-11402,width-400,resizemode-4/109852202.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Atletico Madrid took a step closer to securing a Champions League spot with a 1-0 victory against Mallorca in LaLiga on Saturday, thanks to an early goal from winger Rodrigo Riquelme .With only four matches left to play, Diego Simeone 's team sits in fourth place with 67 points, maintaining a six-point lead over fifth-placed Athletic Bilbao.Earlier on Saturday, Real Madrid clinched their record-extending 36th LaLiga title after Girona's comeback win against Barcelona , with a score of 4-2.This result gave Carlo Ancelotti's side an unbeatable lead in the standings. Real Madrid defeated Cadiz and now hold a 13-point advantage over second-placed Girona, while Barcelona slipped to third with 73 points.The match at Son Moix stadium had a lackadaisical atmosphere, with both teams displaying a lack of intensity in a largely uneventful game. The only notable moment came in the fifth minute when Riquelme scored a brilliant individual goal to secure the win for the visitors. He seized a loose ball at the edge of the box, evaded two defenders, and struck an unstoppable shot just inside the right post.Atleti's Axel Witsel emphasized the importance of the win, stating, ""It was very important to win. We wanted to win and stay six points ahead. We have to keep it up. After Riquelme made that fine control and scored a fantastic goal, we managed to stay well organised to secure the result.""",Atletico Madrid beat Mallorca 1-0 in LaLiga.

ISL final: Chhangte inspires Mumbai to 3-1 comeback win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-final-chhangte-inspires-mumbai-to-3-1-comeback-win/articleshow/109852049.cms,"Mumbai steal home team's thunder with great 2nd-half show

KOLKATA: The referee's final whistle was yet to be blown but Lallianzuala Chhangte briefly came over to the Mumbai City FC bench and kissed the crest of his jersey. A couple of his teammates came out of their seats to bow down to him in deference.The packed stands of 62,000 had fallen silent by that time.It was Mohun Bagan SG's heartbreak and Mumbai City FC's hurrah. It was Chhangte's night.In a team game, Mumbai City's No. 7 painted the Salt Lake Stadium's canvass with one of the finest individual performances this season, guiding his team to a remarkable 3-1 win over Mohun Bagan to lift the ISL championship title and denying Antonio Lopez Habas 's Shield winners an opportunity of doing a 'double' in the league.Chhangte, who finished the league with 10 goals - the maximum among domestic players - didn't score this time. But such was his elegant menace that he almost single-handedly brought crowd favourites Mohun Bagan to their knees. His acceleration, vision and endless determination were too much for the home team. He simply eviscerated the opponents.Mumbai City started with such intensity that Chhengte was denied by the woodwork twice in the first half. Yet, the fickle hand of football seemed to turn the script on its head in a stunning way when Jason Cummings put Mohun Bagan ahead in the 44th minute in what was the team's second shot on target at that time.But Petr Kratky 's Mumbai - having certainly learnt from their Shield-losing defeat here three weeks ago - continued to control the game with their passing and possession and always looked threatening on the break. The equalizer came in the 53rd minute through Jorge Pereyra Diaz .Mumbai soon lost Pereyra Diaz and Alberto Noguera to injury. But their substitutes Bipin Singh and Jakub Vojtus rose to the occasion, scoring in the 81st and 95th minute, respectively, giving Mumbai the deserved victory.While Mumbai players sang and danced with the cup, the result also put a question mark on Habas's strategy. They missed the usual creativity, and the likes of Manvir Singh, Liston Colaco and Dimitri Petratos were not given the license to set the tempo until the final 15 minutes when they decided to throw the kitchen sink in desperation.Mumbai started on the front foot, flourishing in Petr Kratky's pass-and-move doctrine and leaving Mohun Bagan all over the place. The imperious Chhangte - the winger with exceptional work rate - was the heartbeat of their relentless pressure on the Bagan box.Soon after Chhangte saw his lay-off across the goalline go begging, he came calling again, this time his looping shot hit the crosspiece.The woodwork came to Bagan's rescue again when, receiving the ball from Vikram Pratap Singh, Chhangte took aim at the goal, the ball coming back into play after hitting the far post.The storm was heavy but Bagan somehow managed to weather it for a while, and then added a twist to the tale out of nowhere.Two minutes after Liston Colaco fired Bagan's first shot on target in the match, the Bagan winger initiated another move just on the cusp of halftime, with his usual brisk pace down the left flank. Petratos, receiving the ball from him, unleashed a ferocious strike from the edge of the box. Mumbai goalkeeper Phurba Lachenpa could only manage to block it but Cummings --just like the semifinal second-leg clash against Odisha FC here six days ago --reacted the quickest to slam home the rebound.But Mumbai came back and stole the home team's thunder with a remarkable second-half performance.","Mumbai City FC beat Mohun Bagan 3-1 to lift ISL championship title.

NEW DELHI: Ipswich Town 's triumphant return to the Premier League after 22 years was sealed with a commanding 2-0 victory over Huddersfield , securing promotion from the Championship.Goals from Wes Burns and Omari Hutchinson propelled the Tractor Boys into the top flight, marking only the fourth instance in the Premier League era of consecutive promotions from the third division.While Ipswich basked in their glory, Leeds' hopes were dashed as they fell 2-1 to Southampton, setting up a playoff showdown against former club Norwich for Daniel Farke's men.Despite the absence of their famous fan Ed Sheeran, scenes of jubilation erupted at Portman Road as Ipswich fans flooded the pitch in celebration, igniting blue flares to mark the historic occasion.The Suffolk club, which was sold to American investors for just £40 million ($50 million), will now pocket at least £200 million in television revenue in the coming years.Huddersfield's relegation woes were confirmed prior to their match against Ipswich, owing to their significantly inferior goal difference compared to their relegation rivals.Wes Burns' early strike alleviated any tension among Ipswich's home supporters, slotting the ball low into the bottom corner just 27 minutes into the game. On-loan Chelsea winger Omari Hutchinson further eased nerves by netting a second goal for Ipswich merely three minutes into the second half.Amidst Ipswich's celebrations, concerns arise regarding the retention of their highly-regarded manager, Kieran McKenna, formerly a first-team coach at Manchester United. McKenna's potential departure has been linked to Brighton, should Roberto De Zerbi vacate the managerial position.Meanwhile, West Brom secured their playoff berth with a convincing 3-0 victory over Preston, setting up a clash with Southampton.Birmingham suffered relegation despite a 1-0 win over Norwich, marking the end of their first season with NFL legend Tom Brady as a minority owner.Blackburn's 2-0 win against Leicester thwarted the latter's title celebration aspirations, while Plymouth's 1-0 victory over Hull sealed Birmingham's fate, holding them off by a single point in the table.","Ipswich Town return to the Premier League after 22 years with 2-0 win over Huddersfield.

Mumbai City stand between Mohun Bagan and ISL 'double',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/mumbai-city-stand-between-mohun-bagan-and-isl-double/articleshow/109831532.cms,"KOLKATA: It has been the longest and perhaps strangest Indian Super League season. As the dust settles on it with Saturday's grand finale at the Salt Lake Stadium , the order in India's domestic football has already been established.Mohun Bagan SG and Mumbai City FC have emerged truly and decisively as the best in business. Nineteen days after Antonio Lopez Habas 's green-and-maroon brigade pipped the rivals from Mumbai to their maiden the Winners' Shield, they are back again, this time the championship title being up for grabs.There will be more at stake, however and expect fireworks.As Mumbai's Spanish midfielder Alberto Noguera said at the pre-match press conference: ""This is revenge for us. It's an opportunity to show who we are.""Habas does not usually indulge himself in any such hyperbole. But the veteran Spaniard - the lone managerial survivor of the league since its inception a decade ago - made it clear how he was being driven by the sense of the occasion to ""complete the circle"" - of winning the ISL Shield and playoff trophy in the same season.Mumbai City remain the sole owner of this honour. When they achieved this feat back in 2020-2021 season, Habas - then standing as ATK Mohun Bagan coach - ended up getting the wrong end of the stick on both occasions.Having finished the league on top, Habas is certainly salivating at the prospect of crossing the finishing line once more. It could also be a boundary-obliterating push for him as no team has managed to defend the ISL title and a Shield-Cup 'double' will brighten the halo around his managerial accomplishments more.Habas and his opposite in the Mumbai camp Petr Kratky, however, stressed that it will be a different ball game on Saturday, with its own nature of unpredictabilityMumbai, though, are keen on learning from that 1-2 defeat in the league's grand finale here on April 15 and getting even with the new Shield-winners. ""It's a special game for us. We know what quality Mohun Bagan possess but we like to be more pro-active with our passing and control the game this time around,"" their coach Petr Kratky said.When two attacking teams come on a collision path, expect certain patterns to emerge. Both teams flourish in attacking width with wing-backs shaping the team's strategy in slicing open the rival defence. The key to the tie is likely to lie in how they go about using the space behind. Mohun Bagan's Manvir Singh or Liston Colaco and Mumbai City's Lallianzuala Chhangte, Bipin Singh or Jayesh Rane are known for 'hugging' the line, ready to raise their pace to a gallop. Such is the intensity of the system that no player can afford to be isolated, especially during transition when the contest can be won or lost.Apart from Armando Sadiku, Mohun Bagan have all players available. Mumbai will miss Dutch midfielder Yoell van Nieff through suspension and Akash Sharma through injury.Habas and Kratky - having assumed charge in the second half of the league - have imbued their respective team with the feel of a juggernaut. So much about the concept that changing managers in the middle of the season is more about stemming the slide than gunning for glory. So much forMumbai have lost twice to Bagan at the Salt Lake Stadium this season - in the Durand Cup quarterfinals and ISL Shield-decider. Bagan will again enjoy a full house. Can they bring the house down again? Or will Mumbai return to the razzle-dazzle in this rivalry?No quarter will be asked. No mercy will be shown. With the city in the grip of an unprecedented heat wave, expect both teams trying to catch each other cold.",Mohun Bagan SG and Mumbai City FC meet in the final of the Indian Super League. Bagan won the ISL Shield and playoff trophy in the same season last year. Mumbai have lost twice to Bagan at the Salt Lake Stadium this season.
