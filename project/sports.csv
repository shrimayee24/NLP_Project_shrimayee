A 'unique' 96-year wait for India's legendary Olympic hockey teams ends in Paris,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/a-unique-96-year-wait-for-indias-legendary-olympic-hockey-teams-ends-in-paris/articleshow/112151165.cms,"""Sone pe suhaga""

NEW DELHI: In 1928, Indian hockey embarked on a journey that got written and rewritten in 'golden' words, where the team won medals for 10 Olympics in a row. The 44-year run of consecutive podium finishes included a period of 28 years that saw a couple of World Wars, India getting independence and six Olympic editions where the hockey team won six successive gold medals without losing a match.At the 1952 Helsinki Games, wrestler KD Jadhav won India's first post-independence individual medal, a bronze.It was the first occasion when the hockey team's medal had company. But what hockey kept waiting for, since winning its first medal on 26th May 1928, was an Indian 'team' from another sport to join it as an Olympic medal winner.That wait ended after 96 years on July 30th 2024, at the Paris Games when the shooting duo of Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh became the first Indian 'team' apart from hockey to win an Olympic medal.is how hockey legend and three-time Olympic medallist Harbinder Singh reacted in surprise when Timesofindia.com reached out to him over the phone for his reaction on the unique parallel of Manu and Sarabjot's bronze-medal win. The Indians defeated their South Korean opponents, Oh Ye Jin and Wonho Lee, 16-10 on Tuesday in the third-place playoff in the10m air pistol mixed team event.It was Manu's second medal of the Games, after she opened India's account in Paris with a bronze in the women's 10m air pistol individual event.""These two young kids have done well. Good for hockey to have company now with another team, as you pointed out. It never struck me,"" he added.""It still gives me goosebumps when I think of winning the gold medal by beating Pakistan in the (Tokyo) 1964 final, after we had lost to them in the final of the (Rome) 1960 Olympics,"" Harbinder recalled. ""I remember we landed at the Palam airport in Delhi and the entire airport was packed with fans who had come to welcome us.""Talking about similarities to hockey's 96-year wait for an Indian 'team' from another sport to win an Olympic medal, it took 44 years after KD Jadhav's 1952 bronze to have another individual Olympic medal winner from India. Tennis legend Leander Paes ended that wait with his men's singles bronze at Atlanta 1996.It took India 100 years to have a woman win an Olympic medal, a historic feat achieved by weightlifter Karnam Malleswari, who won a bronze at the Sydney Olympics in 2000. She waited 12 years for company in the form of badminton great Saina Nehwal and boxing legend Mary Kom as the next women Olympic medal winners from India. Both won bronze medals at the 2012 London Games.Rifle shooter Abhinav Bindra 's individual gold at Beijing in 2008 was India's first in 108 years of the country's Olympic history at that time. He was joined by track-and-field athlete Neeraj Chopra 13 years later with his javelin-throw gold in Tokyo.Hockey had to wait for 41 years, after its 1980 Moscow gold, to return to the Olympic podium. The bronze at the Tokyo Games in 2021 broke that jinx.Neeraj's javelin gold at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago remains India's first athletics medal post independence. British-Indian runner Norman Pritchard won two silver medals in the 200m events, which are also credited to India, at the 1900 Paris Games.Pritchard's medals waited the longest, 121 years, for the company.",Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh become first Indian 'team' apart from hockey to win an Olympic medal. Hockey won its first medal on 26th May 1928. It took 44 years after KD Jadhav's 1952 bronze to have another individual Olympic medal winner from India.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112151137,imgsize-53716,width-400,resizemode-4/112151137.jpg"

The two players displayed exceptional court movement, countering each other's shots and keeping the score tight throughout the match.In the opening game, Sen initially lost some points on his forecourt returns but adjusted his strategy by incorporating more cross-court shots. The game remained close, with the score fluctuating from 2-5 to 5-5 and later to 15-15.Sen then managed to secure a three-point lead when Chou made errors, including a long backhand and a netted return. Chou quickly rallied back, leveling the score at 18-all with three aggressive returns.Although Sen saved one game point, Chou clinched the first game with a powerful overhead smash.The second game continued the intense back-and-forth dynamic. Both players adapted their strategies to outmaneuver each other continuously. At 7-7, play was briefly interrupted when Sen requested a review on a close line call, which was ruled against him. Despite a brief conversation with the umpire, Sen maintained his composure and surged from 13-all to score five consecutive points.The third and final game saw a notable shift in momentum in favor of Sen. Chou began making uncharacteristic unforced errors, and his returns lost their precision. Sen, on the other hand, increased his pace and kept executing successful returns, smashes, and drop shots.Sen quickly amassed a 16-11 lead, outpacing Chou's attempts to close the gap.A superb cross-court smash gave Sen eight match-point chances and he sealed it when Chou hit the net after a flat exchange.","Lakshya Sen becomes the first Indian male shuttler to reach the semifinals at the Olympics.

The fun of meeting you after almost 12 years was different today,” Joginder wrote.In that historic match, Dhoni handed Joginder the responsibility of bowling the final over against a well-set Misbah-ul-Haq.

This dismissal triggered euphoric celebrations as India clinched the inaugural T20 World Cup by five runs.Joginder's calm demeanor and precise execution under pressure turned him into an unsung hero overnight.""I thought I should throw the ball to someone who really wants to do well in international cricket. Jogi did a really good job,"" Dhoni had said after India won the final.""It's one of the things I will treasure for the rest of my life.

The final SmackDown before SummerSlam was electrifying, featuring some spectacular matches that built up the SummerSlam hype. WWE Undisputed Champion Cody Rhodes and The Bloodline faction leader Solo Sikoa showcased their confidence and determination for the last time before the big event. This week's SmackDown kicked off with a verbal exchange between The American Nightmare and Solo Sikoa, leaving the entire WWE Universe and the crowd in Cleveland, Ohio, shocked by its conclusion.The upcoming match between Cody Rhodes and Solo Sikoa at SummerSlam is now set to be historic.Although Cody Rhodes and Solo Sikoa didn't land a single blow on each other, the stipulation they set for their match stole the show. The upcoming match between Cody Rhodes and Solo Sikoa at SummerSlam will be a Bloodline Rules match . Cody conceded Solo's dominance and, surrounded by Tama Tonga, Tanga Loa, and Jacob Fatu, fearlessly announced the match's stipulation. Solo laughed at Cody, suggesting he was asking for a death wish.During the segment, Solo constantly mocked Cody, the former WWE Undisputed Champion. Solo even called Roman Reigns a weak Tribal Chief. In response, Cody acknowledged Roman Reigns, saying he had already fought the real Tribal Chief at WrestleMania 40 and was ready to take down the wannabe.The last time Cody Rhodes competed in a Bloodline Rules match was at WrestleMania 40 against Roman Reigns. This match was historic and is regarded as one of the greatest WrestleMania matches of all time. During that bout, Cody had allies like Jey Uso, John Cena, and The Undertaker by his side. Now, he stands alone. Although Cody teamed up with Randy Orton and Kevin Owens, The Bloodline brutally assaulted them, leaving Cody to face Solo on his own.The pressure on Cody to defend his title is immense, especially since he has no one backing him. In contrast, Solo Sikoa has the support of his faction, making it intriguing to see how Cody will handle The Bloodline by himself. There are rumors that Roman Reigns might return to save Cody Rhodes from a Bloodline attack at SummerSlam. Roman's appearance would make sense given the storyline setup, and SummerSlam is the perfect stage for The Tribal Chief's return. If Roman decides to make a comeback, the crowd in Cleveland, Ohio, will go wild, creating one of the greatest SummerSlam moments of all time.","The final SmackDown before SummerSlam was electrifying.

Koi mujhe maar ke nikal jayega (I don't fight, never physically, somebody can hit me and leave),"" Kohli said.And when the former India captain was dropped a hint that his comment was contrary to his aggressive body language and verbal altercations on the field, he smiled and said: ""Muh se kuchh bhi bulva lo, but mai physical ladai nahi karta (I can say things verbally but never get involved in a physical fight)""Kohli added: ""Even that (aggression) I do on the ground because I know it won't lead to a fight as the umpires would intervene.""Of late, Kohli's infamous on-field altercations with Gautam Gambhir returned to hog the limelight when the latter was announced as India's new head coach replacing Rahul Dravid, whose tenure ended after the T20 World Cup in June.Kohli and Gambhir had been eye to eye more than once and as recent as the 2023 IPL season when the Royal Challengers Bengaluru icon Kohli had an angry face-off with Gambhir, who was mentoring Lucknow Super Giants at that time.However, both have said that they have moved on from those differences.

Confusion: Why there was no 'Super Over' in the tied first ODI between India and Sri Lanka,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/confusion-why-there-was-no-super-over-in-the-tied-first-odi-between-india-and-sri-lanka/articleshow/112256966.cms,"ACCORDING TO THE RULE

THE MOST FAMOUS SUPER OVER IN ODIs

The first match of the ODI series between India and Sri Lanka ended in a tie, but the ' Super Over ' rule was not used as a tiebreaker to decide a winner despite the ICC rules stating that it ""shall be played"".While it's unclear if the rule was amended for the ODI series after mutual agreement between the two teams, the third match of the T20I series in the earlier part of this tour was decided by a 'Super Over'.That led to confusion the day after the first ODI on Friday at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo ended in a tie as India's chase ended at 230 all out, the same total as Sri Lanka's.The ICC's ODI Playing Conditions pertaining to tied ODIs suggest the 'Super Over' rule should have been used by the match officials.The ICC Men's ODI Playing Conditions were last amended in December 2023 and the same have applied ever since. Clause 16.3.1.1 states all ODI matches ending in a tie shall have a 'Super Over' unless conditions don't allow it to be played.According to the rule: ""...a Super Over shall be played. If the Super Over is a tie, then unless exceptional circumstances arise, subsequent Super Overs shall be played until there is a winner. Should it not be possible to play or complete the Super Overs needed to determine a winner, the match shall be tied.”The final of the 2019 ODI World Cup had to be decided on boundary countback after both the stipulated 50-overs-a-side match and the subsequent 'Super Over' ended in ties and couldn't break the deadlock.The second ODI of the series will be played on Sunday.","The first match of the ODI series between India and Sri Lanka ended in a tie.

Manu Bhaker: Paris Olympics: How two below-par rounds cost double Olympic medallist Manu Bhaker historic treble,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/paris-olympics-how-two-below-par-rounds-cost-double-olympic-medallist-manu-bhaker-historic-treble/articleshow/112257516.cms,"CHATEAUROUX: A rollercoaster. That's how Manu Bhaker described it later here on Saturday morning. Her bid for a historic third medal had ended in an agonizing finish. It must have left her feeling empty inside, but she did not show it. She has learnt not to show it. She was there, up there. And then she was not. A couple of poor shots, a couple of poor series – at the beginning and the end – and that was it.That's sport for you.When it all started, Manu looked confident when she walked up to station G inside the 25m pistol women's final hall. The routine was the same, the rigour same. She set up her station, did some shadow shooting and was ready. Both hands in pocket, she waited.The first series was a disaster. She was surely feeling the pressure. She shot 2/5 and found herself in the sixth position in the eight-woman field. A shrug of the shoulders, a fleeting look at her coach Jaspal Rana – sitting in the same seat in the stands when Manu won her first bronze – and she was back to the task. She was not giving up.The second series brought her back. She was alive. 4/5 was just what she needed. She had jumped up to the fourth position. She shot another 4/5 in the third series and moved up to the second position. It was all falling into place.The fourth series was an average 3/5 and Manu slid to the sixth place, just a shot below three above her. But she was very near elimination. Another poor round and it would be all over.But no, that was not the script. She shot a perfect 5/5 to move towards safety and a possible medal. She was now third on 18 points, a point behind Hungary's Veronica Major and two behind South Korea's Yang Jin who went on to win the gold medal.The elimination had started, and Manu was way clear. In the sixth series, she got a 4/5, missing her last shot. But she was back to second, trailing the Korean by two points. The Indians in the stands had started celebrating.The seventh series was again a brilliant 4/5. She stayed in the second spot, now just a point separating her from Jin. The roar in the right corner of the stands was deafening. The India corner.This is where the course changed. A 3/5 could have kept Manu in the hunt for a silver medal, maybe even a gold. With the last four standing, she failed to hold her nerve. 2/5 and Manu found herself in a shoot-off with Major, both now on 28 points.One poor series and it had come to that. Fingers crossed.In the shoot-off, Manu got the first two targets, missed the third and fourth and hit the last one. The Hungarian got four shots to win 4/3. Manu was out. She looked disappointed as she walked back to her corner and sat quietly, probably trying to figure out what went wrong.But the Indian fans were still celebrating, chanting her name, clapping. They had travelled a long distance just to see her shoot, to back her, to show her love. The medal went missing in that single shot, but she was still a champion. A star was born at the shooting ranges here last Sunday. She shone bright the whole week.Manu is just 22. Her journey from Tokyo 2021 to here has been a difficult one, full of sacrifices. She followed a rigid regimen, a strict diet, worked out hard in the gym and trained for hours and hours at the range. Pushed by her coach, she steeled herself to come out of a dark place and discover a new Manu.Manu 2.0 has been a revelation. Very few who saw her crash badly in Tokyo were willing to back her. There were stories of indiscipline, all kinds of rumours. And to think she was just 19 then, mentally fragile, helpless. Alone. She went back to Rana and that changed her life. He held her hand, helped her heal and slowly moulded her into a tough cookie. She would crumble no more.Manu Bhaker has come a long way, but her journey is incomplete. She wants more. India wants more.","Manu Bhaker's bid for a historic third medal ended in an agonizing finish. The 22-year-old shot a perfect 5/5 to move towards safety and a possible medal.

NEW DELHI: Imane Khelif ’s Olympic journey in Paris began with a victory shrouded in controversy, setting the stage for a dramatic and polarizing narrative.The Algerian boxer , who had been reinstated for the Games despite a previous disqualification from the 2023 World Championships due to a failed gender eligibility test, found herself at the centre of a storm before she even stepped into the ring.In her opening bout, Khelif faced Italy’s Angela Carini , a seasoned fighter with high expectations.However, the match ended abruptly after just 46 seconds, a rare occurrence in Olympic boxing .Carini, visibly distraught and bleeding from her nose, cited intense pain from the initial exchanges as the reason for her sudden withdrawal.She vehemently denied any political motivation behind her decision, saying, ""If an athlete is this way, and in that sense it’s not right or it is right, it’s not up to me to decide. I just did my job as a boxer. I got into the ring and fought. I did it with my head held high and with a broken heart for not having finished the last kilometre.”Yet, the tension was palpable when Carini refused to shake Khelif’s hand after the fight.Carini’s refusal to engage in the customary post-fight handshake was seen by many as a silent protest, though she insisted it was merely a result of her physical distress. The incident, however, intensified the scrutiny on Khelif’s presence at the Games.Khelif is not a transgender athlete .She was born female but has a disorder of sex development (DSD) that results in XY chromosomes and testosterone levels similar to those of male athletes.The IOC's Framework on Fairness, Inclusion, and Non-discrimination based on gender identity and sex variations provides guidelines for sports federations to promote inclusion and fairness, particularly for athletes with Differences of Sexual Development (DSD).DSD encompasses a group of rare conditions that affect genes, hormones, and reproductive organs.Individuals with DSDs may be raised as female but possess XY chromosomes and testosterone levels typically found in males.Despite the controversy, Khelif, a silver medalist at the 2022 IBA World Championships, remains undeterred in her Olympic aspirations.Her next challenge is a quarterfinal bout against Hungarian trailblazer Anna Luca Hamori, a match that holds significant weight. A victory would not only secure Khelif an Olympic medal but also potentially reignite the ethical and sporting debates surrounding her eligibility.",Algerian boxer Imane Khelif is not a transgender athlete.

Bumrah turned the tide of the match by dismissing the dangerous Mohammad Rizwan , sending Pakistan reeling when they were comfortably placed at 80/3.Then, in the Barbados final, Bumrah bowled a game-changing spell against the Proteas, giving up only four runs in the 16th over and dismissing dangerous power-hitter Marco Jansen to put the opposition on the defensive in their pursuit of 176.""He (Bumrah) just showed the world what it takes...and you know, it's not often in your career when you have a ball in your hand and you say, 'do this and the ball does that',"" Shastri said in the ICC Review, according to PTI.""I think the India-Pakistan (match) because India were made to fight there and realise what the right combination should be going forward in the tournament.

'Going to be an all-rounder's game in the coming days': Team India's bowling coach Sairaj Bahutule,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/going-to-be-an-all-rounders-game-in-the-coming-days-team-indias-bowling-coach-sairaj-bahutule/articleshow/112241780.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bowling coach Sairaj Bahutule Sairaj Bahutule has suggested that India will persist in providing their top-order batsmen with chances to bowl. He believes this strategy can serve as a ""surprise element"" against the opposing team.In the opening ODI against Sri Lanka, which concluded in a tie on Friday, opener Shubman Gill was given the opportunity to showcase his bowling skills.Despite conceding 14 runs in his solitary over, Bahutule affirmed that this approach will continue to be implemented in the future.“I think our batters are good bowlers as well, to be honest. You know their primary skill is batting, so at times, they don't focus much on their bowling. But they have the skills,” said Bahutule in the post-match press meet.Charith Asalanka, the Sri Lankan captain and their top batter, demonstrated his all-round skills by bowling 8.5 overs and claiming three wickets for 30 runs.His victims included Shivam Dube and Arshdeep Singh , who were dismissed in consecutive deliveries. Asalanka's crucial contribution helped Sri Lanka secure a tie in the match.To support his argument, Bahutule cited the instances of Suryakumar Yadav and Rinku Singh being called upon to bowl in the T20I series against Sri Lanka.The inclusion of these part-time bowlers in the playing eleven highlights the importance of having multiple bowling options in the shortest format of the game.“You might have seen in the T20Is…Rinku and Surya contributed with the ball. So, an opportunity was given to Shubman here. It's going to be an all-rounder's game in the coming days.“So, if one or two (batsmen) from the top-order can bowl it will definitely help the team, of course, depending on pitch conditions and situations.“Also, it will be a surprise element to the opposition, if a batter can bowl. So, moving ahead there will be ample opportunities for batters to bowl,” he explained.Bahutule expressed that the visiting team had the opportunity to build more substantial partnerships, especially after their explosive start to the innings. He felt that they could have capitalized on the strong foundation laid by the openers and constructed a more formidable total.“To have a tie in ODI is always exciting. Yeah, we should have got that one run and finished off the match. Nevertheless, I thought we bowled really well.“We did bat well in patches, and we could have had few partnerships that would have taken us (home) with less wickets going,” he said.Bahutule admitted that the Lankan spinners used the nature of the pitch to the hilt.“I think the nature of the pitch and the way they bowled…Hasaranga and Asalanka executed their skills very well.“We tried our best to get into the partnerships, and Shivam (Dube) also batted well and contributed. But yes, we could have put in that one extra effort of scoring that single run.”The former India leg-spinner said the team should have capitalised on the start given by skipper Rohit Sharma . Rohit made a superb 58 off 47 balls that helped India reach 75 in 12.4 overs.“The start given by Rohit was fantastic, and at one stage it looked like we wouldn't lose too many wickets. It (the way Rohit batted) was important when the ball was hard and coming onto the bat. I think it was his first ODI innings after the (50-over) World Cup.“It didn't look like there was a break. He takes on the responsibility, sets the tone against any opposition, any pace attack. He is very positive in his intent.”","Sairaj Bahutule says India will continue to give top-order batsmen chances to bowl.

NEW DELHI: Strategies to counter a slow pitch and a variety of slow bowlers from Sri Lanka will be at the top of India's list of priorities for the second ODI, which is set to take place in Colombo on Sunday.India lost the first ODI on Friday after chasing a respectable 231 and being well positioned at 130 for three. The Lankan spinners had enough bravery to dismiss the visitors for 230 and force a tie.After surviving the initial onslaught from Rohit Sharma , Lanka successfully carried out their strategy against the Indian hitters, who are not the most cunning players on rank turners-though few are.With surprisingly good results, the host team used their army of tweakers to target the core of the Indian top and middle order-Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, and Shreyas Iyer .Though not uncomfortable, the troika was unable to break away due to several well-planned maneuvers made by the accurate and well-resourced Lankans.Left-arm spinner Dunith Wellalage and leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga tied Kohli down as the Indian batsman faced 29 of the 32 balls that the spinners produced.Eventually, Hasaranga got the better of him, and with Shreyas comfortable against spinners, Lankan captainCharith Asalanka brought pacer Asitha Fernando into the fold.Fernando proved his worth by getting rid of Shreyas with a peach, which was also the only Indian wicket to fall to a pacer.Hasaranga also managed to snatch up Rahul, another outstanding player of spin.The Indians will be keen to bat long and rotate strike, which is the key to neutralising spinners on such surfaces, but faltering in one match leaves too little of a footprint to pursue some of the accomplished names.Despite a barrage of wickets at the other end, Sri Lankans Pathum Nissanka and Wellalage demonstrated this en route to their fifties while handling Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, and Washington Sundar with efficiency.In contrast to their Sri Lankan counterparts, who leaked 167 in 37.5 overs for nine wickets, the four Indian spinners, including Shubman Gill , leaked 126 in 30 overs for four wickets.Therefore, the Indians will aim to limit the harm without sacrificing their ability to score runs, according to PTI.Bowling coach Sairaj Bahutule said as much. ""We did bat well in patches, and we could have had some partnerships that would have taken us (home) with less wickets going. We tried our best to get into partnerships,"" said Bahutule after the first match.Bringing in Rishabh Pant or Riyan Parag is one option India might consider, as both are excellent at combating spinners and can throw off their rhythm by playing some of those unconventional smashes.While scooping and reverse-sweeping Washington Sundar and Axar, Wellalage accomplished that to flawless effect.Parag also brings with him the package deal of being both an off-spinner and a leg-spinner.It is still to be seen, though, if the Indian team management-which hasn't been their habit lately-will alter their ways after just one game.After limiting a far better and far more experienced opponent, Sri Lanka will go into the second game of the three-match series in a healthier mental state.They will, however, be monitoring Hasaranga's fitness as he was observed clenching his hamstring near the end of his spell in the first one-dayer.Rohit Sharma (C), Shubman Gill (VC), Virat Kohli , KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohd.
