NEW DELHI: In Chennai Super Kings' commanding 78-run victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad, Tushar Deshpande's sensational bowling performance during the powerplay proved to be the game-changer. Ruturaj Gaikwad, the skipper, recognized Deshpande's pivotal role in shifting the momentum back in their favour, a momentum that had been elusive throughout the season.Deshpande's wholehearted effort reflected in his figures of 4/27 off three overs. Particularly impactful were his three wickets during the powerplay, which dismantled the formidable Sunrisers Hyderabad batting order, led by Travis Head.In terms of individual performances for IPL 2024 Purple Cap list, Mustafizur Rahman's exceptional bowling performance saw him claim two wickets, elevating him to the second position in the IPL Purple Cap List. Rahman now has 14 wickets in 8 innings, tying with Purple Cap leader Jasprit Bumrah of Mumbai Indians, who has taken 14 wickets in 9 innings. However, Bumrah retains the top spot due to his superior economy and average.Also See: IPL Orange Cap 2024 Harshal Patel of Punjab Kings follows closely behind in third place in the Purple Cap race, also with 14 wickets in 9 innings, but his economy and average are not as impressive as Bumrah and Rahman's. Matheesha Pathirana of CSK also had a noteworthy performance in the match, claiming two wickets, bringing his total to 13 wickets in 6 innings, securing him the fourth spot on the purple cap list. T Natarajan is in fifth place, having taken 13 wickets in 7 innings, including the crucial dismissal of Ruturaj Gaikwad for 98.",The IPL Purple Cap 2024 will be the largest in the world. It will be worth an estimated $1.2 billion. The cap will be paid in equal installments over a period of 20 years. It is expected to be the biggest cap in the history of the IPL.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109681945,imgsize-59894,width-400,resizemode-4/109681945.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In the latest IPL showdown, Chennai Super Kings dominated Sunrisers Hyderabad, with Skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad leading the charge with a stellar 98 runs. Gaikwad's aggressive innings, supported by contributions from Daryl Mitchell and Shivam Dube, propelled CSK to a formidable total of 212 for three after being invited to bat.CSK's victory was further sealed by a clinical bowling performance, spearheaded by Tushar Deshpande, who bagged four crucial wickets for 27 runs in his three overs.SRH's cautious batting strategy failed to counter Deshpande's early breakthroughs and the subsequent pressure applied during the middle overs. As a result, they stumbled to a disappointing total of 134 all out in 18.5 overs.In the 46th match of IPL 2024, Ruturaj Gaikwad narrowly missed out on a century, falling just two runs short. However, his impactful innings not only secured a crucial victory but also propelled him up the Orange Cap leader board. With a total of 447 runs from 9 innings, Gaikwad currently sits in second place, trailing only behind Virat Kohli of RCB, who continues to exhibit exceptional form with the bat.Speaking of Kohli, he further solidified his position at the top of the Orange Cap race by adding another half-century to his impressive tally, becoming the first player to breach the 500-run mark this season. His total of 500 runs maintains his lead in the IPL 2024 Orange Cap race.Behind Kohli and Gaikwad, Sai Sudharsan occupies the third position on the highest run-scorers list, with a total of 418 runs in 10 innings, courtesy of another half-century performance against RCB. Following Sudarshan is RR's captain Sanju Samson, who has accumulated 385 runs in 9 innings, closely trailed by LSG's skipper KL Rahul with 378 runs from 9 innings.","IPL Orange Cap is a multi-billion dollar investment by the Indian state-owned bank. The IPL is one of India's leading investment banks. The bank is also one of the largest in the world, with a market value of more than $1.2 billion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109680685,imgsize-42044,width-400,resizemode-4/109680685.jpg"

T20 World Cup selection: Too many loose ends,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-selection-too-many-loose-ends/articleshow/109675512.cms,"Agarkar-led selection panel has a tough job to do

Third opener and second wicketkeeper

Sticking with tried and tested seam attack

Power game in the middle

NEW DELHI: With the deadline to announce the teams for the upcoming T20 World Cup fast approaching, the selection committee and the team management have been working overtime to strike the right combination.By no means, this is going to be a straightforward selection for the Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee.He was in the Capital on Saturday to watch the match between Delhi Capitals and Mumbai Indians. It is speculated that Agarkar had an informal meeting with Rohit Sharma about the team.According to sources, there are three major contentious issues that need to be resolved before BCCI secretary Jay Shah convenes the meeting to formally announce the 15-member team. The team is slated to leave for the World Cup on May 21 with the players who will be out of the IPL by then.TOI understands that the selectors are torn between Sanju Samson and KL Rahul for the second wicketkeeper-batsman slot with Rishabh Pant having done enough to prove his fitness and form to be the first choice for this position.Rahul's intent at the top of the order has always been debatable. However, as the ongoing IPL season has progressed, the picture has changed with two young openers - Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill - looking off the boil. Both Rahul and Samson's international records are not great. But Gill, with his struggling form in the IPL, doesn't command automatic selection yet.This is where Rahul could pip Samson in the race even though Samson has been having a dream season while leading Rajasthan Royals. Rahul's experience at the top of the order and his willingness to bat in the middle order gives him a chance.With Mohammed Shami injured, the Indian seam attack suddenly looks shaky. The IPL has been particularly cruel on the bowlers with team totals touching unprecedented highs. Sources told TOI that the team management wants to stick with the lot which has been part of the setup for the last two-three years even though. Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj have gone for around nine runs per over so far in the IPL.""The team management wants to trust the players it has groomed. There are concerns about Siraj and Arshdeep going for so many runs but one has to look at the context. In these matches, you have to think about defending the target set by your team-even if you do it by 10 runs. Jasprit Bumrah is different class. The others should not be compared with him. There won't be 'impact player' rule in the World Cup. Axar Patel, for example, has been exemplary with his economy rate,"" the source told TOI.Bowlers who could give them competition are Avesh Khan and Mukesh Kumar who have been growing into the role of bowling the tough overs. The selectors will have to decide if they want to go in with an extra spinner Ravi Bishnoi or the extra pacer because Hardik Pandya's seam bowling can't be ignored. Bishnoi is seen as someone who can bowl at any stage of an innings.The biggest challenge will be to have the power hitters in the middle order. Rohit and Virat Kohli have been steady run-getters but the onus to post humongous scores will fall on power-hitters in the middle and late middle-order. The striking abilities of Hardik and Ravindra Jadeja have not been very inspiring.The team management had groomed Rinku Singh for that role. Shivam Dube has also emerged as an option. But him not bowling enough may pull him down a bit. Sources say the selection committee isn't keen on getting swayed by IPL performances but someone like Tilak Varma can't be ruled out.",The deadline to announce the teams for the upcoming T20 World Cup fast approaching.

NEW DELHI: The national selection committee, headed by Ajit Agarkar, will convene in Ahmedabad on Tuesday to meet with BCCI secretary Jay Shah. The purpose of this meeting is to finalize the 15-member squad for the ICC T20 World Cup in the Americas, although the official announcement may be delayed by a day.Shah, who also serves as the convenor of the senior selection committee (men), has prior political commitments that are keeping him occupied.Therefore, the selection meeting will be held in Ahmedabad to accommodate his schedule.Key discussion points during the meeting will include deciding on the second wicketkeeper's slot and assessing the inclusion of all-rounder Hardik Pandya in the squad.It's understood that KL Rahul , with an IPL strike rate of 144 and 378 runs in the tournament so far, and Sanju Samson , who has scored 385 runs at a striking rate of 161, are vying for the second wicketkeeper's position.Despite Samson's impressive performances for Rajasthan Royals as their captain this season, marking the first time in over a decade he's shown such consistent form for his IPL team, his batting at No. 3 isn't likely to secure him a spot on the Indian team.Another school of thought is that someone like Samson, who has 25 T20Is under his belt but an average of just 20 and a strike rate of around 135, should not be considered based on just one good IPL season.In case of Rahul, it can be said that one senior member of the coaching staff will certainly go all out to push for his inclusion but many believe that the stylish right-handed batter's approach in T20 cricket remains archaic.However, he is still considered a better bet than Samson at No. 5 or 6 on slowish Caribbean tracks.The other option, Jitesh Sharma, is in very poor form, while Dhruv Jurel hasn't got a chance to keep wickets. During the last game in Lucknow, he did get an opportunity to bat long and scored a fifty.Left-handed batter Tilak Varma, who is also a handy off-spinner, remains an option along with pacer Sandeep Sharma, the Punjab veteran whose slower variations at the death have played a big role in Rajasthan Royals' surge to the top of the IPL table.","The national selection committee, headed by Ajit Agarkar, will convene in Ahmedabad on Tuesday to meet with BCCI secretary Jay Shah.

NEW DELHI: Varun Chakravarthy 's three crucial wickets in the middle overs complemented Vaibhav Arora 's impressive start as Kolkata Knight Riders showcased a vastly improved bowling performance, restricting Delhi Capitals to a modest 153/9 in their IPL clash in Kolkata on Monday.Making a comeback, Arora (2/29) provided KKR with a strong start during the power play after Delhi chose to bat on a challenging wicket.Chakravarthy, introduced in the ninth over, then weaved a spellbinding performance as he bowled four consecutive overs and claimed the key dismissals of Rishabh Pant (27; 20 balls), Tristan Stubbs (4; 7 balls), and impact substitute Kumar Kushagra (1), finishing with an impactful spell of 3/16 that turned the match in KKR's favor.Harshit Rana also contributed with two wickets, but Mitchell Starc remained a weak link in the bowling attack, with the star Australian pacer conceding 43 runs in his three overs, averaging 14.30 runs per over.Veteran Sunil Narine went about his task quietly to end with 1/24 while accounting for Axar Patel (15; 21b), as none of the DC batter could consolidate after a brisk start.On a day their batters failed to capitalise, Kuldeep Yadav became Delhi's top-scorer and his 26-ball 35 not out against his former franchise was the reason they crossed the 150-mark.KKR, in fact, would be disappointed for not being able to bowl out Delhi despite having them at 111/8 inside 15 overs, and Kuldeep's knock frustrated the home team.For a change, there were no fireworks at a venue that has witnessed record runs being scored and innumerable sixes being hit.This time the bowlers dominated the power play, reducing Delhi to 67/3 on a pitch that seemed to be two-paced as batters struggled to get their timing right.Making a return after missing the last two matches, seamer Arora seized the early initiative, striking twice for KKR inside four overs.First, Arora halted Prithvi Shaw's brisk start and dismissed him for 13. Then, he bowled a peach of a delivery that angled in before darting away after pitching to clean up Hope (6).The Eden Gardens also missed a Jake Fraser-McGurk special with Starc taking the latest IPL sensation's wicket in the third over.After smashing Starc for a six and four in successive deliveries, Fraser-McGurk wanted to clear the deep square leg, but mistimed and struck it straight to Venkatesh Iyer.From Delhi's perspective, their run-rate was way above 11 and they needed someone to consolidate but KKR kept taking wickets.Local player Abhishek Porel looked the most at ease, and took on Harshit Rana for successive 4-6-4 with exquisite timing and aggression.But Rana had the last laugh, beating the Bengal wicketkeeper with pace.Rishabh Pant got a reprieve on 18, when Rana dropped a sitter, but the Delhi skipper looked scratchy and was dismissed by Chakravarthy for a third time in the IPL.",Varun Chakravarthy takes three crucial wickets for Kolkata Knight Riders.

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders' principal owner Shah Rukh Khan on Monday expressed his desire to see left-handed power-hitter Rinku Singh in the Indian squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup .Shah Rukh described it as his 'personal wish', highlighting his belief in Rinku's abilities.Rinku, 26, gained significant attention during the IPL 2023 when he showcased his exceptional batting skills.In a thrilling game against Gujarat Titans, Rinku played a big role in KKR's remarkable victory, smashing five consecutive sixes in the final over.Rinku's name has been doing the rounds as far as selecting the 15-member Indian squad is concerned for the T20 showpiece, which will be held in the USA and West Indies across June. He has a strike-rate of 176 plus in 15 T20I for India with two fifties,Expressing his optimism for Rinku's World Cup prospects, Shah Rukh said during an interview on Star Sports, ""Such amazing players are playing for the country. I am really looking forward to Rinku, Inshallah being in the World Cup Squad and some other youngsters from other teams also.""Some of them deserve it so much, but my personal wish is that Rinku makes it to the team. I will be so happy. That will be the high point for me.""With the KKR top-order doing the bulk of scoring so far this season, Rinku has not got many opportunities with the bat.In his debut season however, the hard-hitting batsman from Aligarh amassed 356 runs in 15 matches, remaining unbeaten in seven of those games. His runs came at a strike-rate of over 175 but power-hitting is not his only talent, for he has the ability to remain calm in pressure situations.The Bollywood megastar, who shares a great rapport with Rinku, is delighted at his rise after having faced many obstacles on his road to success.Growing up in modest surroundings, Rinku's family struggled to make ends meet, with his father working as an LPG cylinder delivery man and his mother a housewife.Despite the offer of a job as a sweeper, Rinku followed his passion for cricket, believing it would lead him to greater heights.SRK said, ""I just want them to feel happy and when I see these boys playing, I feel like I am living as a sportsperson myself. Especially players like Rinku and Nitish (Rana), I see myself in them. I feel really happy when they perform well.""","Kolkata Knight Riders' principal owner Shah Rukh Khan has expressed his desire to see Rinku Singh in the Indian squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup.

NEW DELHI: Renowned Inter Miami star and eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi took a break from his football duties to attend the Miami Heat playoff game against the Boston Celtics on Monday night.Accompanied by his teammates Jordi Alba , Sergio Busquets , and Luis Suarez , who also played with him at Barcelona, Messi arrived at the arena just before tip-off.The group, with some wearing Heat attire and Busquets donning a Heat hoodie, entered through the players' parking garage and were escorted via a VIP entrance to their suite seats above the lower level.Although Messi had previously visited the arena for at least one other event, this marked his first arranged attendance at a Heat game since relocating to Miami last year.Inter Miami have been performing exceptionally well in the Major League Soccer (MLS) this season, boasting a 6-2-3 record and currently leading the Eastern Conference with the highest points tally in the league.Messi's contributions have been instrumental, with two goals and an assist in Inter Miami's recent 4-1 victory over New England on Saturday. He has achieved the remarkable feat of having multiple goal contributions in five consecutive matches, a first for any MLS player.Throughout his illustrious career, Messi has amassed over 800 goals for both club and country, solidifying his status as one of the greatest scorers in soccer history.His crowning achievement came in 2022 when he led Argentina to the World Cup title, scoring twice in the final against France. The match ended in a thrilling 3-3 draw, with Argentina ultimately triumphing 4-2 on penalty kicks.","Lionel Messi attended the Miami Heat playoff game against the Boston Celtics.

ISL: Mumbai see off Goa to set up final showdown with Bagan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-mumbai-see-off-goa-to-set-up-final-showdown-with-bagan/articleshow/109703553.cms,"MUMBAI: Jorge Pereyra Diaz wanted to lap up every second of it. The Argentinian striker had just given Mumbai the lead in the second leg of their Indian Super League semifinal against FC Goa , putting the Islanders 4-2 ahead on aggregate, and he was in the mood to celebrate.Joining him were thousands of Mumbai City fans who made sure their delight was heard around the 7000-capacity Mumbai Football Arena.They had to wait until the 69th minute for that joyous moment, and it was to get even better seven minutes from the end of regulation time.This time it was Lallianzuala Chhangte who timed his run perfectly from inside his half to latch on to a sublime assist from Vikram Partap Singh, neatly take it past Goa goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh, and tap the ball into the net to make it 2-0. For the second time in five days, Goa were left crestfallen.They had been looking good to arrive here with a 2-0 lead from their first leg at Fatorda last Wednesday. But in a matter of six crazy minutes in the closing stages of that game, the Gaurs watched in agony as Chhangte and Vikram turned that lead into a 3-2 win in favour of the Islanders.Despite that slap in the face, Manolo Marquez's side, backed by around 250 travelling fans, would have come to Mumbai encouraged by their form on the road, having scored in their last nine away games. It's another matter that they were up against the league's meanest defence, and the latter eventually won.Mumbai's 2-0 victory on Monday and a 5-2 win on aggregate has earned them the right to take on Mohun Bagan Super Giant in Saturday's final. Petr Kratky's side will look at it as a chance to avenge their narrow defeat to the Kolkata giants a fortnight ago on the last day of the league stage which saw Bagan thwart Mumbai's hopes of becoming the first team to defend the League Winners Shield.For now though, the Islanders will cherish a win they had to work extremely hard for, against an opponent who has challenged them each time they have met this season.They may have endured a nightmare finish to the first leg of this semifinal but Goa managed to make a positive start here, looking clearly to their American winger Noah Sadaoui to launch attacks down the left channel.After his tremendous impact as a second half substitute in Fatorda, where he produced two sublime assists for the goals that contributed to Mumbai's jaw-dropping comeback, Jayesh Rane was duly rewarded with a starting spot on this occasion. But the midfielder struggled to get his teeth into the game for most of the first half.The home side soon settled and would come the closest to scoring in the opening 45 minutes when they struck the post twice, first through a Tiri header off a corner, and later when Chhangte wasn't able to curl his left-footed effort enough.In his pre-match press conference, Marquez had admitted that the Gaurs could well find themselves in a situation where they would have to take increased risks. That moment arrived in the second half when Mumbai captain Rahul Bheke saw his header off Yoel van Nieff's corner cleared off the goal line by Goa defender Nim Dorjee Tamang. But Pereyra Diaz was there, as he usually is, perfectly placed, to poke the ball home.Vikram has scored eight times for the Islanders in the league this season, including a hat-trick against NorthEast United in March, but the forward showed how well he can create opportunities too, releasing Chhangte with a delightful pass around Goa's defence, as Mumbai's number 7 got the home support going again with a fine finish.There are likely to be questions raised about the relevance of the ISL playoffs going forward, with the format now really holding no significance apart from the prize money on offer. What there can be little doubt about though, is the two best teams over the course of the 2023-24 campaign will clash for the trophy at Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday!","Mumbai City beat FC Goa 4-2 on aggregate to reach Indian Super League final.

Bayern Munich manager Thomas Tuchel emphasised on Monday that his team is fully prepared to confront the formidable threat posed by the ""extraordinary"" Real Madrid midfielder, Jude Bellingham , in their upcoming home Champions League semi-final, first leg clash.The highly anticipated match, scheduled for Tuesday, pits the 14-time Champions League winners, Real Madrid, against Bayern Munich, who boast six titles in the competition.This encounter stands as the most frequently played semi-final fixture in the history of the tournament.Bellingham, the 20-year-old English midfielder, made a significant move to Real Madrid from Bundesliga outfit Borussia Dortmund at the beginning of the season.Since his arrival, Bellingham has rapidly established himself as a linchpin in Real's midfield, earning accolades as one of the world's premier talents. Impressively, despite primarily operating in midfield, he leads Real Madrid's league goal-scoring charts this season with 17 goals to his name.Tuchel's acknowledgment of Bellingham's prowess underlines the recognition within Bayern Munich's camp of the threat posed by the young midfielder. As the two European giants lock horns, the spotlight will undoubtedly be on Bellingham as he seeks to maintain his influential presence and impact on the semi-final stage.Tuchel said Bellingham was ""a key player in a very offensive position"" for the Spanish giants.""Jude is extraordinary. He was fantastic here in the Bundesliga, how he progressed shows the level of personality he has, it's only possible with a huge personality.""Everyone who plays for Madrid plays with the pressure of the shirt. He plays with the pressure to play with this club and all the expectations.""He handles it like he's never done anything else,"" said Tuchel. ""But we are well aware of it and will try and find solutions tomorrow (Tuesday).""","Real Madrid take on Bayern Munich in Champions League semi-final, first leg.

Mohun Bagan stay in hunt of doing a rare double in ISL,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/mohun-bagan-stay-in-hunt-of-doing-a-rare-double-in-isl/articleshow/109679829.cms,"KOLKATA: Mohun Bagan SG stayed on course for a rare 'double' in Indian Super League , beating Odisha FC 2-0 in the second leg of semifinals and 3-2 on aggregate to reach the final on Sunday.Trailing 1-2 in the first leg of semifinals, Antonio Lopez Habas 's team turned it around in front of 62,007 spectators at the Salt Lake Stadium , with goals from Jason Cummings (22 nd minute) and Sahal Abdul Samad (90+3) sealing the deal here and confirming their passage to the title round for the second successive season.Two weeks after clinching their maiden Winners' Shield, the defending ISL champions are now waiting to welcome either Mumbai City FC or FC Goa in the final, which will be held at the Salt Lake Stadium on May 4.Habas's team is also staring at the prospect of emulating Mumbai City's feat in winning both the Shield and the league in the same season.With much at stake, both teams kept challenging each other throughout 90 minutes. It was an entertaining contest spiced with hits and misses.The onus was more on Mohun Bagan to take the bull by the horns, but they also ran the risk of being sliced open on every slip by Roy Krishna and Co.Habas employed a high defensive high line in a virtual 3-2-4-1 formation to embrace Odisha's challenge with both discipline and boldness.However, such a system comes with its own risks and rewards. Krishna's pace and potency down the right always left Bagan full-back Subhasish Bose and others searching for answers. At least on three such occasions in the first 45 minutes, Bagan survived scares born of the Fijian's feet. Anwar Ali first cleared the danger with a nick-of-the-time intervention, Diego Mauricio then failed to keep Krishna's cutback on target and Hector Yuste --- who failed to prevent Krishna from scoring Odisha's winner in the first leg --- rose to the occasion, denying Isak Ralte with a goalline save.Thus reprieved, Bagan ended the first half with the reward. Petratos, receiving the ball from Liston Colaco, tested Amrinder Singh with a snap shot. Although the Odisha goalkeeper managed to block it, Cummings reacted quickest to tap in the rebound. Odisha protested for an offside but as the assistant referee's flag stayed down, Cummings was already in the embrace of his teammates, celebrating and sending the loud and boisterous stands into rapture.The second half was more open. Bagan --- who were showing more intention of winning the contest within regulation time --- should have swelled the lead in the 58th minute. Liston Colaco's delivery across the face of goal found no taker to make the most of it. Manvir retrieved it at the other end and sent it back into the Odisha FC box. Anirudh Thapa met it with a deft header only to see the ball roll down through the legs of Amrinder and miss the far post by a whisker.Odisha kept soaking up the pressure, perhaps trying to turn it into a battle of attrition as extra-times loomed. But when Manvir raided their box in the third minute of stoppage time, it became the decisive moment. His pacey run left Odisha defence in tatters and as he sent it towards the goal, Sahal --- who replaced Thapa in the 71st minute --- ghosted in from behind. Just like the first goal, Amrinder managed to block the first attempt by Sahal, but the ball bounced up to hit the Bagan substitute and went in.Odisha threw the kitchen sink in search of a goal which could have taken the contest into extra times, but Bagan held their nerves, fighting on the back of their pluck and luck in crossing the finishing line.","Mohun Bagan SG beat Odisha FC 2-0 in the second leg of semifinals and 3-2 on aggregate to reach the final on Sunday.

Like losing their head coach Des Buckingham who left the club to take over at hometown club Oxford United last November.Like losing key players like Greg Stewart and Rostyn Griffiths , who both parted ways with Mumbai City in January.Like signing Spanish striker Iker Guarrotxena in the January window, only to then lose him for the remainder of the season to a knee injury. Each time, Mumbai bounced back to ensure their league form didn't suffer and eventually only missed out on becoming the first team in the competition to defend the League Winners Shield after a gutting final-day loss to Mohun Bagan Super Giant in Kolkata.It was that same resilience that surfaced at a critical juncture last Wednesday, as Mumbai stunned the hosts with three late goals to snatch an incredible victory that has now put them in a favourable position to reach the Indian Super League final next Saturday.Ahead of Monday's return leg at the Mumbai Football Arena, Kratky, who took charge in December, spoke glowingly about the character of his team, but made it a point to play down their one-goal advantage.""It wasn't easy, there were a couple of setbacks as everyone knows but we can be proud of ourselves how we have handled it and how we kept going,"" the Czech-Australian said at his pre-match press conference. ""What I really like in this group is they stick together in hard times and push through it, so I'm very proud of every single one of them.""That said, he was keen to remind his side about the importance of stepping onto the pitch on Monday with the right approach. ""If you put it into perspective, we were losing 2-0 in 90 minutes, so everything certainly was not perfect. But we have addressed that,"" Kratky said.""We know it will be a difficult game. Goa is a quality team. We have to respect that. But what happened last game, it doesn't matter.
