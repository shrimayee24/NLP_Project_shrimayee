Gossip swirled around Paulina Gretzky, Dustin Johnson, and Brooks Koepka ahead of the 2018 Ryder Cup

Koepka and Johnson both deny any conflict, call rumors baseless



Back in 2018, ahead of what would become a disappointing Ryder Cup for Team USA, a swirling controversy involving Dustin Johnson , Brooks Koepka , and Johnson’s now-wife Paulina Gretzky threatened to overshadow the golf itself. Though both Johnson and Koepka have denied any fallout, rumors from that time continue to resurface — and Gretzky remains a central figure in the alleged drama.According to reports from Golf Digest and L’Equipe, tensions allegedly flared during the team’s flight to Paris. Sources speculated that Koepka was “comforting” Gretzky during a rough patch in her relationship with Johnson. That claim was never substantiated, but an anonymous source described the atmosphere in the U.S. locker room as “horrible” for the rest of the trip. The Americans were defeated 17.5-10.5 by a united European team.Koepka, speaking at the Alfred Dunhill Championship, firmly pushed back against the narrative. “This Dustin thing, I don't get. There was no fight, no argument. He is one of my best friends,” Koepka said. “We talked on the phone on Monday and yesterday so tell me how we fought? I don't know. People like to make a story and run with it.”Dustin Johnson, who married Gretzky in 2022 after years of ups and downs, also took to social media to clarify their situation at the time. “Every relationship goes through its ups and downs, but most importantly, we love each other very much and are committed to being a family. Thank you for your love and support.”In 2025, both Koepka and Johnson find themselves facing challenges on the course. Johnson needed a special exemption to enter Quail Hollow, having missed the cut at Augusta. Koepka, meanwhile, skipped the champions dinner and opened with a disappointing 4-over 75.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's son Ty Gretzky shows favouritism, backs Rick Tocchet's return as Flyers head coach with enthusiastic message While neither made the cut at this year's PGA Championship, the old rumors serve as a reminder of how off-course speculation can sometimes eclipse the game itself — even for golf’s biggest names.","Gossip swirled around Paulina Gretzky, Dustin Johnson, and Brooks Koepka ahead of the 2018 Ryder Cup.

Rahul Dravid reflects on RR's narrow losses: 'One or two hits away in every game'

Poll Do you believe Shreyas Iyer will continue his successful captaincy in the upcoming matches? No, I doubt it. Yes, definitely!

NEW DELHI: Nehal Wadhera and Shashank Singh struck fluent half-centuries, while left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar picked up three crucial wickets as Punjab Kings defeated Rajasthan Royals by 10 runs on Sunday to seal a spot in the IPL 2025 playoffs. The win took Punjab to 17 points — level with Royal Challengers Bengaluru — but RCB retained second place thanks to a better net run rate.Leading PBKS in his debut season with the franchise, Shreyas Iyer etched his name in the IPL record books by becoming the first player to captain three different teams into the playoffs. He had earlier led Delhi Capitals in 2019 and 2020, and Kolkata Knight Riders in 2024, before repeating the feat with Punjab this season.Overall, Iyer is only the fifth player to lead three different IPL franchises, joining the likes of Steve Smith (Rajasthan Royals, Pune Warriors India, Rising Pune Supergiant), Kumar Sangakkara (Punjab Kings, Deccan Chargers, Sunrisers Hyderabad), Mahela Jayawardene (Punjab Kings, Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Delhi Capitals), and Ajinkya Rahane (Rajasthan Royals, Rising Pune Supergiant, Kolkata Knight Riders).Among them, only Iyer and Sangakkara have led all three sides on a full-time basis.Batting first, Punjab piled up a daunting 219 for 5, powered by Wadhera’s blistering 70 off 37 balls, Shashank’s unbeaten 59, and a handy 30 from captain Iyer.In reply, Rajasthan came out all guns blazing, with openers Yashasvi Jaiswal (50) and Vaibhav Suryavanshi (40) adding 76 runs in just 4.5 overs. But Brar (3/22) provided the breakthrough by removing Suryavanshi in the fifth over, triggering a steady fall of wickets. RR eventually finished at 209 for 7, falling just short in a high-scoring thriller.Punjab Kings will now take on Delhi Capitals on May 24 and Mumbai Indians on May 26 in their final two league matches.","Shreyas Iyer becomes the first player to captain three different teams into the IPL playoffs.

Dustin Johnson jokes about 'lifting a bigger kid' while explaining previous back injury

Struggles on the LIV circuit and fading Ryder Cup hopes

Dustin Johnson, one of golf’s most enigmatic and successful players, recently opened up in a way few professional athletes do—mixing humor with candor while addressing a back injury that once sparked plenty of headlines. As the 2025 PGA Championship unfolded, Johnson's performance—marked by a disappointing 12-over finish and a missed cut at Quail Hollow—wasn't the only thing fans were talking about.Last season, Johnson was forced to sit out part of the golf calendar due to a lower back injury. When asked whether the injury occurred while swinging a club or lifting a child, Johnson slyly responded, “Yeah, lifting up a kid, just a bigger kid,” with a grin—clearly referring to his wife, Paulina Gretzky . The remark instantly sent ripples of laughter through the press room. One surprised journalist exclaimed, “I’m done!” while another added, “I don’t know how to follow that up.”While playful in delivery, Johnson’s comment shed light on how personal life and professional sport often overlap. The two-time major champion emphasized that the injury wasn’t golf-related, sidestepping a deeper explanation while still offering a headline-worthy moment.Despite entering the PGA Championship healthy, Johnson has struggled to regain his top form in recent years. His LIV Golf performances have lacked the dominance he once displayed on the PGA Tour , and his fading visibility has reportedly impacted his standing with Team USA’s Ryder Cup selection.Reflecting on a slow start to last season, Johnson shared, “I was ready at the start... I tweaked my back right before [Saudi International]. So I didn’t hit balls for a few weeks… just taken me a while to get back.” He admitted he developed “some bad habits,” but remains optimistic: “Swinging it well, feeling good, got confidence.”Also Read: Why the NHL never wanted Wayne Gretzky's son Ty Gretzky— even with the name Johnson and Gretzky have been together since 2013, engaged the same year, and married in 2022.

Judge calls out scandalous legal tactics in high-profile Hollywood dispute

Taylor Swift’s private world gets dragged into the spotlight — again

Rift between Swift and Lively threatens long-standing friendship

A recent federal court decision may bring a welcome sigh of relief to pop icon Taylor Swift and NFL star Travis Kelce , as a judge moves to tamp down escalating legal drama that risked pulling the couple deeper into controversy. The dispute centers around a harassment case involving actor Justin Baldoni and actress Blake Lively — a close friend of Swift — which has now taken an unexpected turn with Swift’s name being thrust into the spotlight.U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman issued a strong rebuke this week, striking from the court record a letter that accused Lively’s legal team of attempting to coerce Swift into making a public statement supporting Lively.The letter, written by attorney Bryan Freedman on behalf of Baldoni, alleged that Lively had threatened to release private text messages unless Swift voiced her support — a claim that Judge Liman deemed potentially libelous and lacking merit. The judge warned against “legal maneuvering” designed to ""promote scandal"" and emphasized the importance of focusing on the facts rather than stirring public drama.Swift, who skyrocketed into NFL relevance thanks to her high-profile romance with Kelce, was reportedly “really hurt” after being implicated in the legal mess. According to PEOPLE reporters Benjamin VanHoose and Sean Mandell, a source revealed that Swift and Lively were attempting to move past the situation, though recent legal moves appear to have reopened emotional wounds.The same report cited an earlier complaint filed by Baldoni, which noted that Lively had allegedly referred to Swift as one of her “dragons” in a text exchange — a cryptic and telling descriptor that may hint at deeper tensions between the two friends.“Their friendship has halted,” PEOPLE reported. “Taylor wants no part in this (Lively) drama.” The fallout is especially poignant given that Swift is the godmother to Lively’s four children with husband Ryan Reynolds.A source close to the ongoing case added that a recent subpoena “fractured” the “fragile peace” between the two women, potentially ending a high-profile Hollywood friendship that once seemed unbreakable.Also Read: Donald Trump vs. Taylor Swift feud takes a toxic turn: Is it tearing apart Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes’ longstanding NFL brotherhood?

Aaron Rodgers to Steelers a done deal already?

(Credit: Getty Images)

Insider who penned Aaron Rodgers’ life says Pittsburgh could soon land the legendary QB



The Pittsburgh Steelers might be on the cusp of one of the most fascinating quarterback acquisitions in recent NFL memory. As the Aaron Rodgers saga unfolds, fans and insiders alike are bracing for what could be a transformative chapter in both the franchise's future and Rodgers' storied career. According to Out of the Darkness author Ian O’Connor—Rodgers' biographer and longtime friend—there’s a strong belief that a deal is imminent, and it could all culminate before the start of the Steelers’ mandatory minicamp.“I do think there will be a happy ending, at least for him and we will find out for the Steelers and their fan base,” O'Connor shared in a recent appearance on 93.7 The Fan. “If I had $100 to put down, my feeling is he will be in uniform June 10th, for the start of the mandatory minicamp.”O’Connor’s insights carry weight. He interviewed more than 250 individuals for his 2024 biography on Rodgers and maintains close ties with the quarterback. His conviction about the move isn’t rooted in guesswork—it's shaped by Rodgers’ own behind-the-scenes messaging to Pittsburgh. O’Connor mentioned that Rodgers has signaled his intent to play for the Steelers but has been delaying the official move due to unresolved personal matters.“He’s told [the Steelers], ‘Listen, I’m gonna play for you. I just don’t want to go there and then miss part of mandatory minicamp because of my personal issues. I’m pretty sure they’re gonna be solved by the end of May, at least in my satisfaction where I can give you my all,’” O’Connor explained.These personal issues, which Rodgers acknowledged in his only public remarks this offseason, reportedly involve someone close to him. While O’Connor opted not to reveal specifics, he clarified, “The sense I got was, I think I have a pretty good sense of what it is, and I don’t think it’s something that would prevent him from playing football.”From a football standpoint, Rodgers would be a clear upgrade for the Steelers, especially over Mason Rudolph. While Pittsburgh’s offense may not be overflowing with elite talent, Rodgers is the type of quarterback who can elevate the players around him. With weapons like DK Metcalf, Pat Freiermuth, Calvin Austin, and Robert Woods, the veteran’s presence could unlock a new dimension for the Steelers’ attack.O'Connor is optimistic—not just about the fit, but about the outcome. “Do I think the Steelers are going to win the Super Bowl? No, but if you told me 11-6 with at least one playoff victory, the first with that franchise since 2016, I think that's realistic. I think that this could be a success story, and certainly a worthy ending for him.”For Rodgers, a move to Pittsburgh wouldn’t just be about chasing a Super Bowl. It would be about redemption. His brief, injury-marred stint with the Jets was widely viewed as a disappointment. “He knows it was an embarrassment in New York largely, and he’s the face of that embarrassment,” O’Connor said. A strong run in Pittsburgh could rewrite the narrative and offer Rodgers a satisfying final act—one that proves Act II wasn’t his final bow.With OTAs set to begin in just over a week and the 2025 NFL schedule now revealed, timing seems to be aligning perfectly. If the deal materializes, expect a press conference in Pittsburgh soon—ushering in what might be Rodgers' last, and potentially most poetic, NFL chapter.Also Read: Eagles star calls Ivanka Trump “beautiful,” and she responds with a special locker room message","Ian O'Connor, Aaron Rodgers' biographer, believes a deal is imminent.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

One of the criticisms against Sarfaraz Khan has always been that he has been too overweight — many have termed him as 'fat' and hence unfit to play top-level cricket, even though legendary opener Sunil Gavaskar has defended his fitness, emphasizing that a player's performance and cricket fitness are more important than their body weight.In a heartening development that should certainly help him in his cricket career, Sarfaraz, who was picked for the India A squad for the upcoming tour of England on Friday, has eventually decided to improve on this aspect too. After remaining unsold in the IPL, the 27-year-old has been working hard on improving his fitness in recent times and shedding excess weight. In his endeavour to become lean and fit (and he does bear a far more slimmer look these days than earlier), the Mumbaikar has lost a staggering 10 kilograms in a month. In fact, since the last couple of months, Sarfaraz's whole family has been on a weight-losing spree, which has produced significant results. Advised to lose weight on an urgent basis to avoid a knee replacement surgery, Sarfaraz's father-cum-coach Naushad Khan has lost 12 kgs in a month.""Our whole family is focused on a 'weight-losing mission.' Sarfaraz has lost nine kilograms too in six weeks, which isn't easy, and he's raring to lose more weight,"" Naushad told TOI. ""Both Sarfaraz and I have been slogging in the gym at the Mumbai Cricket Association 's BKC facility for at least an hour for six days a week. I go for a walk, while he jogs at the club for almost an hour, and then there's a 30-minute swimming session. Even my younger son Moin (Khan) has lost a lot of weight,"" he said.Much of this weight-loss mission for the Khans has also involved a ""strict diet."" ""Sarfaraz and I have stopped eating aata (flour) and rice at home completely. Our diet is now strict but interesting — we eat vegetable sauté with boiled chicken, boiled eggs, and drink green tea and black coffee,"" Naushad said. ""We are using very little (olive) oil in our food,"" Naushad revealed. That means that Sarfaraz is no longer feasting on his favourite non-vegetarian dishes — particularly the chicken and mutton biryani — but it's a sacrifice that the middle-order batter has consciously made to improve his fitness drastically.Both Sarfaraz and his younger brother Musheer Khan (the Punjab Kings all-rounder was back home in Mumbai when the IPL was halted briefly) have been training daily (morning and evening) at the Karnatak ground on Cross Maidan under the watchful eyes of Naushad. While Sarfaraz is set to miss the third edition of the T20 Mumbai League, even though he was the Icon player for Aakash Tigers, Musheer was bought for Rs 15 lakh by Arcs Andheri.",Sarfaraz Khan has lost a staggering 10 kilograms in a month.

Saquon Barkley’s rumored Madden 26 cover sparks fan outrage and fears of the infamous ‘Madden Curse’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/saquon-barkleys-rumored-madden-26-cover-sparks-fan-outrage-and-fears-of-the-infamous-madden-curse/articleshow/121250458.cms,"Saquon Barkley gracing the cover of Madden NFL 26 have fans are divided (Getty Images)

The Madden Curse returns to headlines after Saquon Barkley’s name surfaces

Political spotlight adds fuel to the controversy

As rumors swirl about Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley gracing the cover of Madden NFL 26, fans are divided—and many are panicking. While the honor of being selected as a Madden cover athlete is a hallmark of NFL superstardom, the shadow of the so-called “Madden Curse” continues to loom large, fueling fears that this move could jeopardize both Barkley’s health and the Eagles’ Super Bowl ambitions.Dating back to 1999, the Madden Curse has left a trail of unfortunate injuries and downfalls. It began with Garrison Hearst, who suffered a devastating ankle injury after his cover appearance, sidelining him for two years. And while some athletes like Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes have emerged unscathed and even thrived after being featured, others haven’t been as lucky—like Christian McCaffrey, who struggled following his Madden 24 cover moment.Now, as reports suggest Barkley could be EA Sports ’ latest poster boy, Eagles fans are sounding the alarm. One fan posted bluntly on X (formerly Twitter): “Injury incoming. Look what happened to CMC.” Another was more direct: “He will be hurt all season.”The fear isn’t unfounded. Barkley, a dynamic playmaker, is crucial to the Eagles’ Super Bowl defense after their title-winning run in Super Bowl LIX. Losing him to injury could be devastating for Philadelphia’s offensive schemes. One alarmed user summed up the sentiment: “They tryna put the Madden curse on the Eagles now.”Barkley has also faced scrutiny off the field. After golfing with former U.S. President Donald Trump—just a day before the team’s official visit—he faced backlash for his political proximity. He swiftly responded on X: “Maybe I just respect the office — not a hard concept to understand. Just golfed with Obama not too long ago… and look forward to finishing my round with Trump!”While some praised his diplomacy, others saw it as another unnecessary distraction. With EA Sports being a $38 billion brand, fan sentiment suggests they might be playing with fire. “No. Cancel it. Make it Odell or AB or something again,” one fan wrote.Also Read: NFL faces backlash as Kansas City Chiefs dominate 2025 prime-time schedule with Taylor Swift effect in full swing Whether the rumor proves true or not, the conversation around Saquon Barkley and the Madden 26 cover is exploding.

Auston Matthews’ hockey dream wasn’t cheap and his mom took the weight

“I used to work in the morning for Starbucks, in the afternoon the restaurant, i was very fortunate to have two jobs. And believe me, if they would have more hours, I would have more jobs.""





Before Auston Matthews was an NHL superstar, his biggest supporter was clocking into two jobs, trying to make ends meet. His mom, Ema Matthews , didn’t just believe in his dream, she bankrolled it, penny by penny, from behind a Starbucks counter. For families without deep pockets, hockey can be financially brutal. But Ema’s resilience turned obstacles into opportunity and her son into one of the league’s brightest stars. Her story is the heartwarming reminder that every great athlete often has a real-life superhero cheering from the sidelines.Ice time, gear, coaching, travel, youth hockey isn’t just a sport, it’s a financial beast. For the Matthews family, especially with Ema being originally from Hermosillo, Mexico, the culture and cost of the sport were both daunting. But she took on the challenge without hesitation, picking up multiple jobs including a gig at Starbucks to ensure Auston never missed a chance to grow on the ice.Ema shared in a past interview that the cost of hockey often reached up to $20,000 a year, a heavy ask for any middle-class family. To make it work, she didn’t just cut corners, she picked up shifts and poured lattes while helping Auston stay focused on the sport. She even deposited small amounts of money in his account so he could grab food with teammates like a regular teen.Ema’s story also breaks stereotypes. In a sport dominated by players from Canada and northern U.S. states, Auston’s rise as a player of Mexican heritage makes his success even more impactful. It's not just about talent, it’s about trailblazing, especially for kids of color or immigrant families who rarely see themselves represented in hockey.Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs ’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL.

Why the NHL never wanted Wayne Gretzky's son Ty Gretzky— even with the name,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/why-the-nhl-never-wanted-wayne-gretzkys-son-ty-gretzky-even-with-the-name/articleshow/121215015.cms,"Despite the name, NHL teams didn’t take the bait on Ty Gretzky (Image via Instagram)

The pressure of legacy proved more burden than boost

Despite the name, NHL teams didn’t take the bait

When your father is arguably the greatest hockey player of all time, the expectations aren’t just high — they’re suffocating. For Ty Gretzky , the eldest son of NHL icon Wayne Gretzky , the pressure to live up to ""The Great One"" was never just on the ice. It followed him into every locker room, every interview, and every shift he played. But despite his last name carrying the weight of a sports empire, Ty never came close to donning an NHL jersey — and few seem to talk about why.Ty Gretzky laced up his skates with the same passion many young Canadians do. But unlike most, his every move was scrutinized. Coaches, scouts, and fans often judged him not as a young player with potential, but as Wayne Gretzky’s son — a comparison no teenager could realistically live up to. As a result, Ty’s hockey development took place in the long shadow of a living legend, which may have stunted rather than supported his path.It’s easy to assume that Ty would get a shot at the NHL just based on the marketing potential alone. But the league never called — not even for a low-risk camp invite. And that raises a question the hockey world tends to avoid: did NHL executives quietly agree he simply didn’t have the talent, or were they wary of the media circus that would follow?While Ty played briefly in junior leagues, including a stint with the Shattuck-St. Mary’s prep school — a pipeline for future pros — his performances were modest. There were no breakout seasons, no jaw-dropping stats. Scouts remained silent. Teams passed him over year after year.Unlike other sports where legacy can open doors, the NHL prides itself on merit. Nepotism rarely flies in a league where every inch of ice is earned. In that sense, Ty Gretzky may be a rare case: the son of greatness who couldn’t buy his way into the league — even if others in his shoes might have tried.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's son Ty Gretzky shows favouritism, backs Rick Tocchet's return as Flyers head coach with enthusiastic message In the end, Ty chose his own path, leaving hockey behind to pursue entrepreneurship and media. But the question still lingers: did the NHL ignore Ty because he wasn’t good enough — or because he was too much of a Gretzky?","Ty Gretzky is the eldest son of NHL icon Wayne Gretzki.

Melinda French Gates’ dream which changed her life

Melinda Gates says she suffered panic attacks

Microsoft founder Bill Gates ex-wife Melinda French Gates has revealed that a recurring dream played an important role in her decision to end her 27-year marriage. The divorce, which was finalised in 2021, followed the surfacing of certain information that impacted the couple's relationship. In a recent interview Melinda French Gates revealed that she experienced recurring nightmares in late 2019. She claimed that the dream turned out be a turning point in her journey.In an interview with enterprenuer Jamie Kern Lima, French Gates described her symbolic dream. Melinda French Gates described that in her dream, she saw that she was standing on a cliff along with Bill Gates and their children. As the dream progressed, the portion of the cliff where she stood began to crumble and break away. This imagery had a profound effect on her, which she interpreted as a clear sign that she needed to separate from Bill and move forward on her own.“I was going to have to make a decision—and I was going to have to make it by myself,” she recalled.""Some dreams will take me years to understand, but if they’re recurring, I know I need to pay attention to them,” added Melinda Gates.While the dream served as a catalyst, Melinda's decision was also influenced by other factors. While she did not disclose specific details, Melinda acknowledged that certain things came out publicly, reinforcing her decision to leave the marriage. She referenced Bill Gates’ past meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, which she described as deeply disturbing. Bill has previously admitted that associating with Epstein was a mistake.In a recent candid interview with The Times, French Gates addressed Bill Gates’ remarks about their divorce. She said, “If you can’t live your values out inside your most intimate relationship, it was necessary.”French Gates also opened up about the emotional strain of the divorce, sharing that she experienced panic attacks throughout the separation. “When you’re leaving a marriage, it’s very, very hard. And the negotiations were tough,” she said.She shared that her first panic attack occurred in 2014 while having lunch with Gates, prompting her to begin therapy. “I’d heard of people having panic attacks and I didn’t know if it was a real thing,” she said.Initially skeptical of therapy, French Gates admitted she later came to understand its value. “It doesn’t mean I’m damaged,” she explained. “It means I’ve been through some difficult things that I need to figure out.”Following the divorce, both Bill and Melinda Gates have continued their philanthropic efforts, though they are no longer working together as a couple. Bill Gates has publicly expressed regret about the divorce, acknowledging his role in the dissolution of their marriage.","Melinda French Gates has revealed that a recurring dream played an important role in her decision to end her 27-year marriage to Bill Gates.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

NEW DELHI: As the IPL 2025 league stage nears its conclusion, the playoff race has intensified, with only a few teams assured of their fate. While some franchises are well-poised for qualification, others face a steep climb.Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) sit comfortably at the top of the points table after earning a point from the washout against Kolkata Knight Riders. With 17 points in the bag, they need just one more win from their remaining two fixtures to officially seal a playoff berth. Given their current form and momentum, RCB look like strong contenders.Gujarat Titans (GT) are also in a commanding position. Their impressive net run rate adds cushion, meaning one more win should be enough to book their place in the top four.Punjab Kings (PBKS) have kept themselves firmly in the mix. With three matches left, they require just one victory to likely advance, assuming other results go their way.Also See: DC vs GT Live Score, IPL 2025 Mumbai Indians (MI) are in a must-win situation. They must win both remaining matches to reach 18 points.

Their net run rate is better than a few of their rivals, giving them a crucial edge in the points scramble.Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) face the toughest task. They must win all three remaining games to hit 16 points. However, their poor net run rate means they will need convincing wins and favorable results from other matches to stay alive.The rest of the teams — Kolkata Knight Riders, Sunrisers Hyderabad, Rajasthan Royals, and Chennai Super Kings — have all been eliminated from playoff contention.

IPL 2025: The unsung heroes of India's T20 league

NEW DELHI: At the season-opening Diamond League meet in Doha on Friday, all eyes were on Indian star Neeraj Chopra , who finally broke the elusive 90m barrier with a superb 90.23m throw.But one notable name missing from the javelin throw lineup was Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem , the reigning Olympics gold medallist.Nadeem’s absence wasn’t due to injury or form issues, it was part of a planned training strategy.The 27-year-old is currently focused on preparing for the Asian Athletics Championships , set to take place in Gumi, South Korea, from May 27 to 31.According to his coaching team, Nadeem will depart for South Korea on May 22, prioritising peak performance at the continental event over early-season showings like the Diamond League.While Nadeem sat this one out, Chopra and Germany's Julian Weber made a statement in Doha.Under the guidance of legendary coach Jan Zelezny , the world record holder, Chopra became only the third Asian and 25th athlete in history to breach the 90m mark.His 90.23m effort wasn’t enough to win, though, as Weber edged ahead with a final-throw bomb of 91.06m. Still, for Chopra, it was a massive psychological and physical breakthrough.Chopra credited Zelezny’s presence and ideal weather conditions for his performance and expressed confidence that even longer throws are possible this season. As the reigning world champion, Chopra will head into the World Championships in Tokyo (Sept 13–21) with high momentum.""I am very happy that Jan Zelezny is my coach, and we worked very hard in South Africa. We are still working on some aspects. My next goal remains 90m,"" he said.",Neeraj Chopra broke the 90m barrier with a superb 90.23m throw.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

NEW DELHI: Nothing seems to be going right for Chennai Super Kings over the past two seasons. The five-time IPL champions missed out on a playoff spot in 2024 and endured another disappointing campaign in IPL 2025 . They were, in fact, the first team to be knocked out of the playoff race this season. Former CSK player Robin Uthappa acknowledged the team’s underwhelming performances but didn’t hold back in criticising fans who took their mockery of the MS Dhoni-led side to extreme levels.Also See: DC vs GT Live Score IPL 2025 Matches between CSK and RCB have always been high-voltage affairs, often bringing out the worst in fans on both sides. The marquee clash has repeatedly seen heated exchanges in the stands, with supporters hurling offensive jibes at each other.This season too, before the IPL was suspended, RCB edged out CSK in a thrilling encounter to keep their playoff hopes alive.Ahead of that game, some RCB fans were spotted selling ‘CSK jail’ jerseys—an attempt to taunt the Chennai-based franchise over their two-year suspension from the IPL in 2016 and 2017.However, Uthappa, who has donned the jersey of both franchises during his IPL career, was unimpressed with the gesture. He criticised the actions of some RCB fans who held up white T-shirts with black stripes to mock CSK supporters.""It was pretty intense. Outside the stadium, they were mocking the team, the players of the team when the bus was leaving, that was one thing that I saw, which I thought was in bad taste. The other one that I saw were the fans fighting with each other. I saw women being heckled, which felt unsavory, to be very honest. We saw that even in Chennai last year, again, uncalled for. It's not on whatsoever,"" said Uthappa on his YouTube channel.""It has gotten pretty intense. They are holding up jerseys, white T-shirts marked with black lines, stating the two years that CSK were banned for. They have kind of written MS' number on it, and Thala under it, depicting that they were in jail for two years, or whatever. It's getting a little beyond sport which concerns me.

NEW DELHI: England all-rounder Tom Curran has finally addressed the viral reports claiming he “cried like a child” at the airport amid the recent India-Pakistan tensions that disrupted international cricket schedules , including the Pakistan Super League (PSL).The claims, sparked by comments from Bangladesh's Rishad Hossain, gained traction across media and social platforms, painting a dramatic picture of Curran's alleged emotional breakdown.Taking to Instagram Stories, Curran broke his silence in a calm and composed manner.“I’m glad to see things resuming, and I pray for continued peace between two very special countries,” he wrote, referring to the de-escalation of the situation.In a humorous tone, he added, “Btw promise, I didn’t cry; was ready,” playfully dismissing the claims.The controversy began when Rishad, in an interview with Cricbuzz, stated that Tom Curran was seen crying uncontrollably at the airport when flights were suspended, and that it took “two or three people to calm him down.”He also alleged that New Zealand's Daryl Mitchell vowed not to return to Pakistan due to the incident.However, facing backlash and realising the gravity of his words, Rishad Hossain later issued a formal apology. “A recent comment I made has been misrepresented, creating a false perception. It lacked context and unintentionally overstated the emotions involved,” he said.“I sincerely regret any misunderstanding and have offered an unconditional apology to both Daryl Mitchell and Tom Curran.”With tensions easing and the PSL resuming on May 17, starting with the clash between Karachi Kings and Peshawar Zalmi — the focus now shifts back to cricket.","England all-rounder Tom Curran has finally addressed the viral reports claiming he ‘cried like a child’ at the airport.

Lamine Yamal is fit but could be rested after a long season

Barcelona to field a rotated XI, Villarreal still fighting for Europe

FC Barcelona takes on Villarreal at home in one of the last matches of the 2024–25 La Liga campaign, and all eyes are on wonderkid Lamine Yamal to see if he will make a first-team appearance this evening. Barcelona vs Valencia is scheduled for 7:00 PM local time (CEST) start and will be played at Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys.Barcelona has already secured the La Liga title, and Flick will have the luxury of being able to rotate his team and possibly rest some important players with the season coming to an end and behind a busy summer schedule.Lamine Yamal had been free from injuries but is now in full match fitness today. Yet, given he has had a high volume of game time this season and Barcelona’s status as already confirmed champions, Flick could rest the 17-year-old prodigy. That sort of tactical gesture would give some of the other squad players some vital playing time and give Yamal a less tired look going into the summer.One of this season's breakthrough players has followed impressive domestic and European performances. However, his ball intelligence, decision-making, and his freedom of thinking made him one of Barcelona's core players in a flash, despite his young age. As much as fans would like to see him play one more time this season, the club might be more interested in his long-term health.The La Liga title is done and dusted, so Barcelona is likely to name an entirely changed XI tonight. Other important players, such as Robert Lewandowski, Araujo, and Pedri, could also be on the bench or play sparingly as Flick plans to test his playing resources. The ruling could benefit academy stars and fringe players who have not had a chance to play on the biggest stage.Also Read: Who is Barcelona star Lamine Yamal’s girlfriend? A look at his rumored partner Alex Padilla Meanwhile, Villarreal will be battling to pick up those important points in their push to qualify for Europe.

Wayne Rooney slams Erling Haaland's penalty decision

Pep Guardiola defends Erling Haaland’s choice

Manchester City 's surprising FA Cup final defeat to Crystal Palace has everyone talking, especially about Erling Haaland 's big decision.

Wayne Rooney , a former hero for Manchester United, said this shows Haaland is not on Messi's or Ronaldo's level. With City not winning anything this season, Haaland's choice has fans and pundits questioning his ability to handle the pressure.Manchester City lost to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final at Wembley, ending their chance to win a trophy this season. Erling Haaland, usually the one to take penalties, shocked fans by giving the ball to Omar Marmoush, who missed the shot. On BBC Sport, Wayne Rooney said this proves Haaland doesn't have the same strong mindset as Messi or Ronaldo, who always want to take big shots.Rooney thinks Haaland, just back from an injury, might have felt too nervous to take the penalty in such a huge game. This has started a debate about whether Haaland can lead City when things get tough. With City out of the Champions League and struggling in the Premier League , Rooney's words put more pressure on Haaland.Fans are now watching to see if he can step up in the last two league games and show he's got what it takes to be a true star. Everyone wants to know if Haaland can prove Rooney wrong and be the hero City needs.Also Read: ""He was evil"": Former Manchester United star confesses Sir Alex Ferguson's methods would land him in jail today Manchester City's coach, Pep Guardiola, had a different take on Haaland's choice to skip the penalty. He said the players decided on the field that Marmoush should take it, based on how they felt then. Guardiola thought Haaland would want to shoot but didn't force him, saying players know best when it's time to step up.This shows City trusts its players to make quick decisions, even if they don't always work out. The defeat has cast doubt on City's spirit as a media and on how they cope with bigger games. With only two more matches left, and only a chance to qualify for next year's Champions League, Guardiola would want Haaland to do his best. His backing of Haaland suggests he has faith in his young striker.But fans are still concerned about Haaland's ability to perform under pressure. The football world is curious if Haaland can turn things around and prove he's ready for the most significant moments. City's season isn't over yet, and Haaland has a chance to show he can lead the team to success despite this setback.Manchester City's FA Cup loss has put Haaland in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. Rooney's harsh words highlight the huge expectations on the young striker, while Guardiola's trust offers hope. With the season nearing its end, Haaland must show he can handle the pressure and lead City forward.","Manchester City lost to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final at Wembley.

Lucknow Super Giants have dominated SunRisers Hyderabad since 2022, winning four of their five IPL encounters. When the teams clash on Monday at the Ekana International Cricket Stadium — their first meeting since the IPL’s resumption — LSG will hold the proverbial psychological edge. Currently in the hunt for a playoff spot, LSG must win all three of their remaining matches, starting with this crucial tie against an already-eliminated SRH side.However, LSG’s performance at home has been inconsistent, with three losses in five games hampering their campaign. They currently sit seventh on the points table with 10 points. Among overseas players, Nicholas Pooran and Mitchell Marsh , who started the season with aggressive knocks, have seen a dip in form. Skipper Rishabh Pant continues to underperform, and David Miller has yet to make a significant impact. Aiden Markram has been the most consistent with the bat. Indian youngsters Ayush Badoni and Abdul Samad have shown promise in the middle order.In the bowling department, Avesh Khan has delivered crucial spells, while Shardul Thakur, despite a strong start, has lost rhythm and was dropped from recent games.The pace unit suffered a blow when Mayank Yadav was ruled out yet again with a back injury. New Zealand’s William O’Rourke has joined as his replacement and is likely to debut against SRH. Prince Yadav and Akash Deep are also available for selection.In spin, LSG’s Digvesh Rathi has shown promise, while Ravi Bishnoi has had a moderate season.LSG will play SRH on a black soil pitch, where they’ve won twice — a stark contrast to their three defeats on red soil pitches. Notably, Rathi reached the ground nearly an hour before the rest of the team, accompanied by head coach Justin Langer and assistant coach Vijay Dahiya, to practice variations under the harsh afternoon sun — a routine he also followed ahead of the match against Punjab Kings.SRH, despite boasting a formidable batting lineup, have bowed out of playoff contention. Now playing for pride, SRH will aim to finish the season on a high.","Lucknow Super Giants have dominated SunRisers Hyderabad since 2022, winning four of their five IPL encounters.

Sai Sudharsan Exclusive Interview: 'The dream is to play Test cricket'

There have been very few imposing opening pairs this IPL like Shubman Gill and Sai Sudharsan . As they walked past the 200-run target set by Delhi Capitals with an over to spare at the Ferozeshah Kotla on Sunday evening, they secured Gujarat Titans ’ spot in the playoffs. This is Capitals’ fourth loss at their home ground and they now need to win both their remaining games against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai on Wednesday and against Punjab Kings in Jaipur on the 24th.It was flawless batting throughout. If the left-handed Sudharsan took the responsibility of getting the team off to a flyer in the powerplay, Gill took over the role in the second half of the innings. With Gill scoring unbeaten 93 off 53 and Sudharsan returning unbeaten 108 off 61, the young duo planned out the chase to a nicety, something KL Rahul seemed to fall short in doing despite his unbeaten 112 off 65 balls while opening the innings in the first half of the match. Sudharsan’s effortless punch over the head of Kuldeep Yadav to bring up his century off 56 balls was a stamp of authority.Unlike the Capitals innings in the powerplay where they scored 45/1, Gill and Sudharsan ensured they never fell behind the run-rate at any stage. Perhaps, it’s just the rich vein of form of the two young boys in their mid-20s, but it never looked like they were going to be challenged by the Capitals bowling.There was hardly a mistimed shot between the two. Sudharsan tore into Capitals captain Axar Patel and T Natarajan in the powerplay before Gill went about effortlessly chipping sixes. Sudharsan’s no-look whip off Natarajan almost summed up how the duo was treating the Capitals bowling. Gill focussed on hitting down the ground as hit seven clean sixes and three boundaries while Sudharsan hit the gaps in his innings which had 12 boundaries and four sixes.Rahul may be on a mission to mend his reputation as a T20 player this IPL, but Gill and Sudharsan made his innings which had 14 boundaries and four sixes, look ultra conservative in the end.It’s been a while since Rahul has opened an innings. He has been branded as a middle-order bat following his travails up the order in T20 cricket till last year.Capitals decided to push their regular opener Abhishek Porel down to No. 3 to let Rahul take charge of the innings from the word go.After the powerplay, the Capitals management must have had second thoughts about the decision. For, Rahul looked out of breath in the first five overs, struggling to even strike at 100.It was the sixth over of the innings bowled by the Kagiso Rabada that got Rahul going. A neat hook shot followed by an effortless drive over the bowler for a six got him going. Even as he took time to get going against Mohammed Siraj and left-arm seamer Arshad Khan, there were no desperation.And once Rahul became his sublime best, one could barely look away. It was perhaps a rare no-slog innings. Be it the controlled shortarm pulls off the spinners or clean lofted shots down the ground besides using the pace of the ball behind square-leg, Rahul was not leaving anything to chance.He put on 90 runs for the second wicket with southpaw Abhishek-Porel after the dismissal of Faf du Plessis. The veteran South African was dismissed for five off 10 balls. Porel started slowly with three off eight balls but soon got in the groove. Tristan Stubbs provided a good finishing touch with a 10-ball 21. In the end, though it was all in vain.",Gujarat Titans beat Delhi Capitals by eight wickets in IPL 2025. Shubman Gill and Sai Sudharsan top scored with 93 and 108 respectively. Delhi need to win both remaining games against Mumbai Indians and Punjab Kings.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121259156,imgsize-135516,width-400,resizemode-4/New-Delhi-Gujarat-Titans-captain-Shubman-Gill-and-Sai-Sudharsan-run-between-th-.jpg"

Nikola Jokic didn’t hide his offseason plans after Game 7 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder



The Denver Nuggets ’ title defense officially came to a halt on Sunday afternoon, as Nikola Jokic and his squad were eliminated in a crushing Game 7 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday, May 18th at the Paycom Center in Oklahoma. The 125-93 defeat sent shockwaves across the league, but Jokic’s post-game comments also grabbed fans’ attention.Nikola Jokic, who wrapped up another MVP-caliber season, didn’t hide his frustration after the game. He finished with 20 points, 9 rebounds, and 7 assists, but only attempted nine shots, far from the aggressive offensive force he’s known to be. When asked about his next steps, Jokic had a quick and honest response, “The next couple of days is gonna be a lot of beer probably.”Jokic also sent a sobering message about the team’s outlook moving forward. When asked if he still believed the current roster could win another title, he gave his candid thoughts, “We didn’t, so obviously we can’t. If we could, we would win it… We didn’t win it, so I think we can’t.”While the loss itself was painful, it exposed the depth issues in the Nuggets. Jamal Murray scored only 13 points on 6-of-16 shooting. Aaron Gordon played through injury, and the team overall looked a step slower than Oklahoma City. Severn players scored single digits against 3 double digits, but none could move past 20 while Zeke Nnaji remained scoreless in his 9.36 minutes of play. Meanwhile, Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander dominated the night with 35 points and 3 steals, proving he’s ready to carry OKC deep into the playoffs.As for Jokic, he averaged a triple-double during the regular season,29.6 points, 12.7 rebounds, and 10.2 assists per game, while shooting an impressive 57.6% from the field and over 41% from three.

Mets fall apart after Pete Alonso’s critical error gives Yankees momentum in shocking comeback win



Pete Alonso has been the heartbeat of the New York Mets ’ offense this season, powering them to the top of the NL East with his relentless bat. But even a red-hot MVP contender isn’t immune to mistakes, and on a high-stakes Sunday night matchup against the Yankees , Alonso had a moment he'd like to erase.With the game tied 2–2 in the bottom of the eighth and runners on second and third, the Mets were staring down a pressure-packed situation. A sharp grounder off the bat of Jordan Vivas found Alonso’s glove, and in a split-second decision, he tried to cut down the go-ahead run at home. Unfortunately for the Mets, Alonso’s throw soared over catcher Francisco Alvarez's head, letting Jasson Dominguez cross the plate and giving the Yankees a crucial 3–2 lead.What followed was a disastrous unraveling. Paul Goldschmidt immediately capitalized, knocking in another run to stretch the lead to 4–2. After Trent Grisham walked to load the bases, Genesis Cabrera briefly halted the bleeding by striking out Aaron Judge. But Cody Bellinger crushed any hopes of a comeback, launching a grand slam to right field that put the Yankees firmly in control, 8–2.Alonso didn’t shy away from accountability. He stepped up postgame and owned the moment with admirable honesty:""I messed it up,"" Alonso said. ""… I just made an awful throw. That whole inning, this game, it's on me. After that throw the momentum got out of hand and they had really good at-bats and this one's on me.""Though known more for his offensive prowess than defensive finesse, Alonso’s impact on the Mets this season has been undeniable. After signing a prove-it deal this past offseason, he’s bounced back from a rough 2024 campaign to reignite MVP discussions with his performance at the plate. Despite the error, his contributions have been vital to New York’s strong start.The Mets will aim to reset quickly as they head to Boston to take on the Red Sox on Monday night, while the Yankees shift focus to their upcoming series against the Texas Rangers. For Alonso, it’s just one misstep in an otherwise stellar season—and he’ll be looking to make sure it’s one fans forget soon.Also Read: Twins’ historic run ends at 13 wins and 34 scoreless innings in heartbreaking 5-2 loss to Brewers","Pete Alonso has been the heartbeat of the New York Mets offense this season.

Rahul Dravid reflects on RR's narrow losses: 'One or two hits away in every game'

JAIPUR: At what should have been their fortress in this IPL season, the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, hosts Rajasthan Royals faced another disappointing defeat on Sunday evening.A brilliant 76-run opening partnership between Yashasvi Jaiswal and Vaibhav Suryavanshi set the tone for the 220-run chase. Despite Dhruv Jurel’s impressive 53 off 31 balls towards the end, the middle order’s poor performance led to Punjab Kings (PBKS) securing a 10-run victory, strengthening their playoff chances.Left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar emerged as the game-breaker, returning exceptional figures of 4-0-22-3. The Royals’ innings began spectacularly, with Jaiswal and Suryavanshi reaching 50 in 3 overs, particularly targeting Arshdeep Singh and Marco Jansen for 39 runs in the initial two overs. Brar turned the tide by dismissing Vaibhav (40 off 15) with a full delivery, caught by Xavier Bartlett at mid-off.Although Sanju Samson joined Jaiswal post-injury, the chase lost momentum when Brar removed Jaiswal (50 off 25) at long-off, followed by Riyan Parag (13 off 11). Earlier, despite PBKS’ top order struggling, their middle order delivered. Nehal Wadhera ’s outstanding 70 off 37 balls from 34/3 steadied the innings, forming crucial partnerships with captain Shreyas Iyer and Shashank Singh. Wadhera’s innings ended in the 16th over when he was pouched by Shimron Hetmyer off the bowling of Akash Madhwal.Shashank remained unbeaten on 59 off 30 balls, ensuring a strong finish. PBKS’ initial struggles saw Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, and debutant Mitchell Owen departing early.Tushar Deshpande, recently selected for India A, claimed two wickets. Arya (9 off 7) fell when he chipped a delivery that stuck in the pitch to Hetmyer at mid-off.Prabhsimran went off like a firecracker smashing boundaries but he was strangled down the leg side by Deshpande and was caught behind. Debutant Kwena Maphaka’s expensive start (4, 4, 0, 6, 1) ended positively with Owen’s wicket (0 off 2). Later, Riyan Parag’s introduction proved effective when Iyer was caught by Jaiswal at long-off.However, Royals will ponder how they messed up yet another chase. In this IPL, they have batted second nine times and have lost eight of those games. Curiously, the team, despite chasing proving to be its Achilles heel, has chosen to bat second in six of those nine games. Two wins of the three games that they have won have come batting first.The eight losses that they have aggregated while batting second is the second joint most in a season.The other team in that dubious list was Pune Warriors who managed to do it twice (2012 and 2013).. Brief Scores: Punjab Kings: 219 for 5 in 20 overs (Nehal Wadhera 70, Shreyas Iyer 30, Shashank Singh 59 not out; Tushar Deshpande 2/37 bt Rajasthan Royals: 209 for 7 in 20 overs (Yashasvi Jaiswal 50, Vaibhav Suryavanshi 40, Dhruv Jurel 53; Harpreet Brar 3/22, Azmatullah Omarzai 2/44) by 10 runs.",Punjab Kings beat Rajasthan Royals by 10 runs at Sawai Mansingh Stadium.

He came through his first HIA (Head Injury Assessment) well and will continue to be monitored under HIA processes.""The injury occurred when Pakistan's Khushdil Shah hit a powerful shot towards Ravindra, who was positioned at deep backward square leg.Misjudging the trajectory of the ball under the lights, Ravindra was struck in the face, leading to immediate medical intervention as he was visibly injured and bleeding.ALSO SEE: Bloody!

Hope he recovers soon....।।।"" said a fan on X (formerly Twitter).""Rachin Ravindra is a far better fielder than the whole team of Pakistan, still can't see the ball while catching??

Prayers for Rachin Ravindra,"" penned another fan.The incident has sparked a wider conversation about the standards of infrastructure and safety measures in place for international cricket matches, with some fans suggesting that the International Cricket Council (ICC) should reassess the suitability of venues based on such criteria.The match concluded with New Zealand defeating Pakistan by 78 runs, setting a challenging target of 330/6 in their 50 overs, bolstered by significant contributions from Glenn Phillips, Kane Williamson , and Daryl Mitchell.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Sai Sudharsan Exclusive Interview: 'The dream is to play Test cricket'

Poll How do you rate Shubman Gill's chances of becoming a successful Test captain? Unsure Low Moderate Very high

Not long after Gujarat Titans (GT) booked their place in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 playoffs, skipper Shubman Gill posted on X, ""Discipline in the details."" That encapsulates Gill perfectly. Unlike the charged captains with their in-your-face attitude, Gill goes about his job without much noise.He would run up and down the length of the field to confer with the bowlers. Even when a catch wasn't plucked, he didn't have a go at the fielder; instead, he applauded the bowler for nearly inflicting a dismissal. Upon a boundary, he would gesture to the bowler that possibly the line wasn't right. At no point would you see an irate skipper or shoulders dropping from the team.That has been the hallmark of a team that has been in perfect touch this IPL season. GT became one of three teams to book their place in the next round of the competition and are primed to finish in the top two. Forming the core of such a confident display is the top-two of Sai Sudharsan and Gill, who are one and two, respectively, in the Orange Cap standings with just 16 runs separating the duo.Gill, expectedly, carries the bulk of the responsibility of winning a second IPL title. Yet, his demeanour doesn't flinch. As it started to pour in the capital on Saturday, the team's football session was interrupted. When it did subside, Gill was one of the first few out to limber up.He would enjoy himself during the warm-up, make deft touches against an advancing defender, opt for simple passes and yet remain ultra-competitive when the ball went astray. That is clearly visible in his approach to batting as well.Where Delhi Capitals (DC) rotated batters in the nets, Gill went through a host of styles in a single lengthy session. It began with throwdowns before moving to squad regulars and net bowlers. He would play defensively to balls that tested him; let the ones go that were outside his range and tonk the ones that deserved to be attacked.Many would be done after the warm-ups and nets, but not Gill. He took a quick breather, spoke to coach Ashish Nehra, and got out of his batting gear before moving to protective gear. Short-gap catches were followed by long-range catches that were plucked with little fuss.At 25, Gill is at a crucial juncture in his career. Having sealed a spot for himself in the India squad, even leading in five T20Is, he's on the cusp of being named the next Test captain . The five-match Test series in England could be his trial by fire following Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli's retirements. The fact that GT are top of the IPL points table, could finish in the top two, and Gill is scoring freely only strengthens his case.""I have seen him from U-16. Actually, in NCA, I have done two camps with him. So from the U-16 age group, I have seen that he used to use his brains a lot more than a lot of other guys at his age. That is one quality that is needed to be a captain,"" said GT assistant coach Aashish Kapoor of Gill.""Where you can use your brains for yourself and for 10 other people. How are you going to win matches? And we have seen this.""When Hardik (Pandya) left, we could have always gone with someone else, a senior as a captain. But we took a chance with him. (Last year) we could see that he was trying hard as a captain. And you can see the results this year.""I mean, the captaincy has been the same, but he is in better form this year, which is helping himself and the team,"" he added.When asked to predict whether Gill could translate his T20 captaincy success into the Test format, Kapoor stated it was hard, using the example of MS Dhoni from 2011.""When (MS) Dhoni was made captain for the World Cup for the first time, he was not captain anywhere. So nobody knew, 10 years, 12 years down the line, he is going to be one of the world's best captains.""If you had asked somebody at that point in time, including Dhoni, what do you think of your captaincy? There would be no answer. So you have to see a person over a period of time before you can make any judgement on him. And he has not even started,"" clarified Kapoor.On the field of play, Gill struggled to get going against Delhi Capitals on Sunday. With 200 to get, Gill focused on rotating the strike and letting his partner Sudharsan shoulder the responsibility of holding the steering wheel.While the left-hander Sudharsan kept his foot on the accelerator and swiftly changed gears, Gill caught on to the task. He scored 21 from the first 19 balls before jumping to 36 off 26 balls and 59 off 35 balls, only to finish on 93 from 53 balls, hitting three fours and seven sixes.""He was (playing) cautiously and also was not timing the ball all that well. But what was important is, he didn't throw away his wicket even though the total was 200. It is so easy when you are chasing 200, which is 10 runs an over,"" said Kapoor on Gill's knock against DC.""And if you are not timing the ball, you could play one or two bad shots and get out and push off. I think Sai played an important role in that because he kept throwing runs at the start.""And they were not getting bogged down. Even though he was not able to time the ball initially, Sai was playing beautifully and that took the pressure off him. So he got that extra time to get in. And then once he was in, he played some good shots,"" clarified the GT official.",Gujarat Titans captain Shubman Gill is at a crucial juncture in his career. Gill is on the cusp of being named the next Test captain of India. The five-match Test series in England could be his trial by fire following Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli's retirement.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121257632,imgsize-111058,width-400,resizemode-4/New-Delhi-Gujarat-Titans-captain-Shubman-Gill-during-an-Indian-Premier-League-.jpg"

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on IPL, India-Australia rivalry | Part 1

Following his team's crushing loss at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday, Delhi Capitals captain Axar Patel has asked his bowlers to step up.After starting the campaign with five successive wins, Delhi Capitals have completely lost their plot, and their chances of qualifying for the playoffs look slim.""Fielding and bowling in the powerplay need to improve,"" Axar said at the post-match presentation.Axar Patel also hailed his opponents for their batting performance and added that the ball was coming nicely onto the bat in the second innings.""The way they batted was excellent. The wicket also got better as the game went on,"" he said.Batting first, Delhi Capitals lost Faf du Plessis early. A 90-run stand between KL Rahul and Abishek Porel (30 off 19 balls, with a four and three sixes), along with cameos from skipper Axar Patel (25 off 16 balls, with two fours and a six) and Tristan Stubbs (21* off 10 balls, with two sixes), helped Delhi reach 199/3.""We felt we had a par score. Got a good finish, KL (Rahul) batted well. Our bowlers tried hard but could not get the win. The way we batted was a positive given the last couple of games,"" said Axar.Delhi's bowling struggled against Shubman Gill (93* off 53 balls, with three fours and seven sixes) and Sai Sudharsan (108* off 61 balls, with 12 fours and four sixes). They put on a dominant, unbeaten 205-run partnership, helping Gujarat win with an over to spare.""The ball came on nicely in the second innings. It didn’t stick in the pitch like it did in the first innings. They didn’t lose wickets, which made it easier as well,"" said Axar.With this win, GT have made it to the playoffs, with nine wins and three losses, giving them 18 points. DC are in fifth spot, with six wins and five losses. One of their matches ended in a no-result. They have 13 points.","Delhi Capitals captain Axar Patel has asked his bowlers to step up.

Sai Sudharsan Exclusive Interview: 'The dream is to play Test cricket'

Gujarat Titans (GT) opener Sai Sudharsan has credited captain Shubman Gill for his ""straight talks"" during their partnerships, which have helped him improve as a cricketer in this year's Indian Premier League (IPL).On Sunday evening, the southpaw smashed 108 not out off 61 balls as GT chased down 200 in 19 overs. He was well supported by captain Shubman Gill, who remained unbeaten on 93 off 53 balls.“There's a lot of understanding between us (him and Shubman Gill). Running between the wickets is one thing we talk about, and when I make a mistake, he points it out — and similarly from my side as well,” said Sudharsan during the post-match presentation ceremony.Asked how he aced the chase, Sudharsan said, “It feels great to help the team win. I missed out quite a few times in doing so this season, and during the break, I was thinking about it — and it paid off today.”“After the six overs, during overs 7 to 10, they bowled really well, and the momentum dipped a bit. But we were cool and calm enough to take the game deep. We got a couple of big overs around 12–13, which helped. In previous games, I took chances and got out, but this time I was more aware and took the right matchups.”Sudharsan is currently sitting on top of the Orange Cap race with 617 runs to his name. He is closely followed by his captain Shubman Gill, who has amassed 601 runs so far this season.The 10-wicket win against Delhi Capitals has propelled the Titans to their third playoffs. Captain Gill was a happy man and also showered praise on his opening partner, who is in red-hot form.“He has been in tremendous form this season — the way he has been able to convert starts. You see the conditions and the situation — we talk about finishing the game and not leaving it to anyone else, because on a wicket like this, a couple of wickets could create pressure. At the halfway mark, we felt we gave 10–15 runs extra. They batted well, and the ball was spinning,” said Gill of Sudharsan.","Gujarat Titans (GT) opener Sai Sudharsan has credited captain Shubman Gill for his ""straight talks"" during their partnerships.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

NEW DELHI: KL Rahul did much of the heavy-lifting for Delhi Capitals as they batted first against Delhi Capitals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday evening. During his 60-ball century, and eventual 112* from 65 balls, he ticked plenty of boxes in an effortless knock which took DC to 199 runs, their biggest total at this venue in IPL 2025 .While playing 65 balls (the most by a batter this IPL season), he pocketed numerous milestones along the way as well: fastest Indian to 8000 T20 runs, fourth on the list of most centurions in IPL history, joint-third in the list of most centuries by Indians in T20s.His innings was stupendously paced as well. In his first 20 balls, he scored 25 runs. In the next 20 balls each he scored 38 and 39 runs, respectively. The last five balls fetched 10 runs. As far as pacing an innings in a T20 is concerned, this was template stuff.And this was the plan all along as DC moved KL Rahul to top of the order. Having tried multiple combinations with none of them proving fruitful, the franchise rolled the dice again. And again, it didn't work out. Faf du Plessis fell for 5 after a laboured start, producing an opening stand of just 16 runs.But it allowed KL Rahul more time to get settled before going into the attacking mode, which saw 14 fours and four sixes. Except, it wasn't enough -- by a long margin.Sai Sudharsan and Shubman Gill showed what DC have been missing all this season -- a set pair to open the innings. The pairing collected their seventh 50-plus stand for the first wicket in IPL 2025. And when they crossed the 100-run mark without much of a fuss, it was their seventh in IPL history.As the score ticked to 158 runs, the records just became harsh on DC, as it was the highest opening stand against them.Not long after, Sudharsan, fittingly, got the job done with a six. The manner of the result was also duly appropriate. Half-tracker outside off by Vipraj Nigam, Sudharsan went on the back foot and pulled well over long-on. Six and Gujarat Titans had earned themselves a 10-wicket win and a place in the playoffs. Well, themselves and Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Punjab Kings as well.The maximum to close the match out was the 11th six of the GT innings, which coupled with the 15 fours, meant 126 of the 205 runs that GT scored came in boundaries or 61.46%.Sudharsan's 108 from 61 balls and Gill's 93 from 53 balls were laden with boundaries, yet there was little risk involved. Where Gill controlled 82% of his shots, Sudharsan was on 85% on that metric.""We've batted and played really well throughout, going into the playoffs is a reward for how well we've done. Openers play low-risk cricket, still they have the ability to hit down the ground and find boundaries. The fours they hit during the game, especially. They know their game, they put a lot of work in strengthening their basics which shows,"" said GT assistant coach Parthiv Patel after the win.""Opening pair is about chemistry and knowing each other's games wel,l which they do,"" he added.On the eve of the match, Parthiv had stressed on looking at the glass-half-full with their batting, suggesting he was focused on the top order doing the job for them. And on Sunday, that glass just got a bit fuller.",Gujarat Titans beat Delhi Capitals by 10 wickets at the Arun Jaitley Stadium.
