IPL Final: Unstoppable Kolkata Knight Riders romp to 8-wicket win over Sunrisers Hyderabad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-final-unstoppable-kolkata-knight-riders-romp-to-8-wicket-win-over-sunrisers-hyderabad/articleshow/110449991.cms,"CHENNAI: A team was curated with extreme care, a mentor par excellence was brought in to run the show, a diamond was picked for incredible price, and by the end of a two-month roller-coaster, the Knights became the 'Don' of IPL , all over again.By the end of Sunday evening, the home of yellow was bathing in a wave of purple. Gautam Gambhir , who had led KKR to their first IPL triumph 12 years ago at the same venue, was celebrating his return to a team he calls his ""second home"".Gambhir's biggest punt of the season, Mitchell Starc for Rs 24 crore, proved to be worth every penny as the Aussie decimated Sunrisers Hyderabad for the lowest score of an IPL final SRH were bowled out for 113 in the 19th over, 12 short of Chennai Super Kings' 125 at the 2013 Eden Gardens final against Mumbai Indians.As the Shah Rukh chartbusters started blaring across Chepauk, the KKR batters had an on-field party, running away with an eight-wicket win in 10.3 overs, to present ' King Khan ' with his third IPL title. Venkatesh Iyer (52 not out off 26 balls) helped himself to some fireworks as KKR completed the most one-sided IPL final in its 17-year history.But before all that, as Cyclone Remal made its landfall in Bangladesh, the weather down the east coast was gloomy through the day, Chennai being no exception.There was a breeze on as well, making the conditions at Chepauk conducive for swing bowling. And when a bowler of the quality of Starc gets such conditions, there's a chance that he can turn absolutely unplayable.SRH left-hander Abhishek Sharma got a feel of that quality in the first over itself as his off-stump was knocked back by a beautiful outswinger. Starc (2-14) created fear in the minds of the SRH top order with the movement that he was generating at a furious pace and Travis Head knew he had to take chances at the other end.Medium-pacer Vaibhav Arora was waiting for this chance and he, too, got the ball to move just a bit that found the edge of Head's bat to send him back for his third duck in four games. The moment the dynamic opening duo was dismissed for virtually nothing, a sense of helplessness crept into the SRH ranks. Another in-form player, Rahul Tripathy was dismissed by Starc within the powerplay.If SRH had to make a comeback, the middle-order of Aiden Markram, Nitish Reddy and Heinrich Klaasen had to rise to the occasion. But here too, the depth of the KKR attack came to the fore with medium-pacer Harshit Rana, wily old Sunil Narine and Russell taking charge.While Harshit used his subtle variations beautifully with the occasional slower balls - one accounting for Klaasen - Narine was his usual stingy self. If that was not enough, old pro Andre Russell (3-19) was equally brilliant.SRH batters completely lost the plot as 'Main Hoon Don' blared across the ground and became the signature tune of Chennai for Sunday night.",Gautam Gambhir's KKR beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by eight wickets in IPL final.

Andre Russell dismissed Aiden Markram in his first over as SRH slipped to 62/5 in the 11th over.SRH could not recover from there.Sunrisers Hyderabad: 113 all out in 18.3 overs (Pat Cummins 24; Mitchell Starc 2/14, Andre Russell 3/19, Harshit Rana 2/24).Kolkata Knight Riders: 114 for 2 in 10.3 overs (Venkatesh Iyer 52 not out).",Kolkata Knight Riders beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by eight wickets in IPL final.

You know, I think Will Jacks, Phil Salt, Jos Butler, in particular, playing in the IPL in the eliminators, pressure, crowd, expectation. I would argue that playing here is better preparation than playing a T20 game against Pakistan.""These comments infuriated a Pakistani journalist, who accused Vaughan of disrespecting the Pakistan team and questioned whether Vaughan would apologize if Pakistan wins the T20 World Cup.The journalist's tweet read: ""Michael Vaughan literally disrespecting the Pakistan bowlers with his comments on the IPL.

Southampton return to Premier League as Armstrong sinks Leeds in play-off final,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/southampton-return-to-premier-league-as-armstrong-sinks-leeds-in-play-off-final/articleshow/110443876.cms,"(With AFP inputs)

NEW DELHI: Southampton secured promotion back to the Premier League after a one-year absence, with Adam Armstrong 's decisive goal leading to a 1-0 victory against Leeds in the Championship play-off final on Sunday.Armstrong's first-half strike at Wembley erased the disappointment of last year's relegation from the top flight, ensuring Southampton's immediate return.Winning football's most lucrative match will bring Southampton an estimated £140 million ($178 million) boost, thanks to the increased matchday, broadcast, and commercial revenues associated with the Premier League.According to financial experts Deloitte, Southampton could ultimately earn up to £305 million if they manage to avoid relegation next season.While the cash prize is a huge bonus, it is the prestige of competing with Manchester City and Arsenal, rather than second-tier minnows like Plymouth and Oxford, that fuelled Southampton's hunger to regain their Premier League status after a year in purgatory.Southampton, whose only major honour is the 1976 FA Cup, had spent 11 years in the Premier League prior to their relegation.They will hope this success, celebrated by over 35,000 of their fans at Wembley, is the prelude to another lengthy spell among the elite.In their first ever play-off final, Southampton made it three wins over Leeds this term despite finishing three points behind the Elland Road club in the regular season.Saints boss Russell Martin has become widely admired for his purist passing principles and this was the 38-year-old's crowning glory.Martin was managing in League One with Milton Keynes Dons just three years ago, but he has transformed Southampton in his first season in charge, to such an extent that they boasted more possession than any team in Europe's top five leagues this season.Securing promotion at Leeds boss Daniel Farke's expense was a sweet moment for Martin after his Norwich contract was terminated by the German during their time together at Carrow Road in 2018.Defeat was a bitter blow for Farke and Leeds, who were relegated alongside Southampton last season.American socialite Paris Hilton and movie star Will Ferrell -- a minority shareholder in the club -- had made good luck videos for Farke's side, but there was no Hollywood ending for Leeds.On the 35th anniversary of the death of their legendary manager Don Revie, Leeds were well below their best in the club's fourth play-off final loss.After losing their grip on an automatic promotion place that went instead to Ipswich, the three-time English champions remain without a win at Wembley since 1992.With Rain Man actor Dustin Hoffman watching from the stands, it was fitting that the heavens opened over Wembley as a torrential downpour hit just before kick-off.Leeds made a fast start but Southampton weathered the storm and as the sun appeared through the clouds, they gradually took control.Will Smallbone threatened to put Southampton ahead with a 30-yard free-kick that was clawed away by Illan Meslier.It was a warning Leeds failed to heed as Southampton snatched the lead with a clinical raid in the 24th minute.Armstrong had scored twice in the play-off semi-final win over West Brom and the striker showcased his predatory instincts again with his 24th goal this season.Cleverly eluding the Leeds offside trap with a well-timed run, Armstrong met Smallbone's pass with a superb strike into the far corner from 12 yards.Leeds were rocked and Armstrong nearly struck again from another instinctive shot from Smallbone's quick free-kick, but this time Meslier was able to parry his close-range effort.Early in the second half, Leeds defender Joe Rodon embarked on a rampaging run that looked certain to end in a goal until Taylor Harwood-Bellis threw himself into a last-ditch block.Leeds pushed hard for an equaliser, but Daniel James' blast cannoned back off the bar before the winger was denied by Alex McCarthy's stoppage-time save as Southampton celebrated their return to the promised land.",Southampton beat Leeds 1-0 in the Championship play-off final at Wembley.

Nevertheless, the campaign remains somewhat overshadowed by their Champions League semi-final exit against Borussia Dortmund .Unfortunately, the lead-up to the final was marred by clashes between rival fans at a motorway toll south of Lille. The incidents involved approximately 300 supporters from both sides, resulting in two coaches being set on fire and 20 fans sustaining minor injuries. French President Emmanuel Macron , who was present at the final, condemned the violence.Mbappe's farewell appearance for his hometown club marked his 308th match for PSG since joining from Monaco in a high-profile transfer in August 2017. He leaves the club with an impressive collection of trophies, including four French Cup winners' medals, six Ligue 1 titles, and two League Cup victories.Throughout the match, Mbappe came close to scoring on several occasions, narrowly missing a diving header in the second minute. Despite Lyon's attempts to stage a comeback, with O'Brien's goal and a brilliant save by PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, Mbappe and his teammates held on to secure the victory in his final match for the club.",Paris Saint-Germain beat Lyon 2-1 in the French Cup final on Saturday.

Manchester United win FA Cup title after beating Manchester City 2-1 in the final,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/manchester-united-win-fa-cup-title-after-beating-manchester-city-2-1-in-the-final/articleshow/110426391.cms,"NEW DELHI: Erik ten Hag made a compelling case to avoid the sack as Manchester United stunned Manchester City with a 2-1 victory in the FA Cup final on Saturday.Despite reports that Ten Hag would be dismissed regardless of the outcome at Wembley, following what he himself termed a ""terrible"" campaign, United's hierarchy may reconsider after his tactical brilliance thwarted City's quest for history.City, heavily favored to secure a second consecutive Premier League and FA Cup double, were left disappointed as Ten Hag's strategy led United to an unexpected triumph.Yet Ten Hag found a way to neutralise Pep Guardiola's side as first half goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo put United on course to win the FA Cup for the first time in eight years.Jeremy Doku squeezed an 87th minute strike past Andre Onana's weak attempted save but it was too late to rescue City.Having ended a turbulent season on a high note, if Ten Hag's two-year reign does end, his exit would provoke memories of fellow Dutchman Louis van Gaal's Old Trafford departure.Van Gaal was fired just two days after United's FA Cup final victory against Crystal Palace in 2016.Ten Hag will hope a more apt comparison is Alex Ferguson's 1990 FA Cup final win against Palace, which kick-started his remarkable run after calls for his sacking earlier that season.Ferguson was in attendance as a match labelled Ten Hag's funeral turned into a triumph for the much-maligned Dutchman.United shareholder Jim Ratcliffe, who has control of football operations at Old Trafford, was also watching from the stands alongside co-owners Joel and Avie Glazer.Linked with Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino and Gareth Southgate, among others, there is still plenty for Ratcliffe to ponder after United finished eighth in the Premier League this season -- their lowest final position since 1990 -- and crashed out of the Champions League in the group stage.Ten Hag believes a lengthy injury list was the root of the problems and can point to the two trophies he has won in three cup final appearances with United as proof of what he can do when his team are at full strength.Ten Hag ended United's six-year trophy drought by winning the League Cup last year and has now avenged their 2-1 loss to City in the FA Cup final 12 months ago despite finishing 31 points behind the champions this term.United will also qualify for the Europa League, avoiding a first season without European action since 2014-15.They benefitted from an unusually tepid City performance as their double bid fell flat in their first domestic defeat since losing at Aston Villa in the league 171 days ago.Last weekend, City became the first team to win the Premier League in four consecutive seasons.But Guardiola's men looked hungover after the celebrations that followed their sixth title in seven years.City were furious when their strong penalty appeal was rejected inside the first minute after Lisandro Martinez's shove sent Erling Haaland sprawling.Content to sit deep with all 11 men behind the ball, United stifled City impressively and gleefully accepted their gift-wrapped opener in the 30th minute.Diogo Dalot's punt forward should have been dealt with by Josko Gvardiol, but the left-back hesitated as he looked for an offside flag.Gvardiol headed the ball over City keeper Stefan Ortega, who had rashly rushed off his line, leaving Garnacho with the simple task of tapping into the empty net as Ten Hag clenched his fist in celebration.Garnacho, 19, was the first teenager to score in the FA Cup final since Cristiano Ronaldo for United against Millwall 20 years ago.Just nine minutes later, the 19-year-old Mainoo punished more sloppy City defending.Garnacho advanced unchecked down the right wing and found Fernandes, whose superb first-time pass reached the unmarked Mainoo for a clinical close-range finish.City pushed harder after the interval but although Doku's shot slipped through Onana's grasp to set up a tense finale, it wasn't enough to deny United.As the final seconds ticked away, Ten Hag stood in the sunshine nervously waiting to celebrate a dramatic win that could earn an unexpected stay of execution or serve as his final fling.(With inputs from AFP)",Manchester United beat Manchester City 2-1 in the FA Cup final at Wembley.

NEW DELHI: Indian football team head coach Igor Stimac anticipates a massive turnout at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata for India's World Cup qualification match against Kuwait on June 6, a significant occasion as it marks the final international match for iconic captain Sunil Chhetri .Chhetri's illustrious 19-year international career, where he amassed 94 goals, solidifies his position as India's all-time leading goal-scorer. With 151 matches under his belt, he also holds the record for the most appearances for the national team.The upcoming match against Kuwait holds added significance as a victory would propel India into a promising position to advance to the third round of the World Cup qualifiers, a historic milestone for Indian football.""Having in mind the importance of the game -- with us being perhaps only a win away from qualifying for the third round for the first time, and it being Sunil Chhetri's farewell game -- we expect the Salt Lake Stadium to be packed,"" Stimac said in Bhubaneswar.""I am sure that our supporters will reach Kolkata from all parts of India to help our boys win the game and say thanks and goodbye to Sunil. I am very confident it's going to be emotional and hopefully, we will find a way to celebrate together after the final whistle,"" he said in a release from All India Football Federation.The team has been engaged in a training camp here for nearly two weeks. The initial focus during the opening week primarily centered on enhancing fitness levels, especially considering the players were entering the latter stages of a demanding season. This period included a series of physical assessments and aerobic training sessions aimed at improving overall conditioning.""The boys are doing well. It has been proven more than once that a long camp always helps us. We are working on various aspects of the game, both offensive and defensive,"" said the head coach.""Our fitness levels are getting better each day, and now we enter the phase of working on our tactics. From Monday onwards, we are going to work on positioning, set pieces and transitions.""The Blue Tigers were originally supposed to depart for Kolkata on June 2, but have advanced their travel to the West Bengal capital on May 29 to get a full week of stay in the city and adjust to the conditions better.""It's obviously hot and humid here, but we enjoy every training session. The facilities and hospitality are amazing here. But still, we have decided to leave for Kolkata a few days earlier than planned so we can adjust to the humidity better and prepare for the crucial game,"" said Stimac.",Indian football team head coach Igor Stimac anticipates a massive turnout at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata.

Carlos Alcaraz flexes forearm in a show of strength in Paris,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/french-open/carlos-alcaraz-flexes-forearm-in-a-show-of-strength-in-paris/articleshow/110444053.cms,"PARIS: Carlos Alcaraz ’s court coverage is something like a light and sound show. You see, but you don’t really see. It’s in the shadows perhaps.Alcaraz’s feet barely skimmed the dirt when on the move in his first Roland Garros outing on Sunday.The Spaniard ran around his backhand, moved in and fell back, brandishing his unbounded athleticism like a cutlass. He reached wide and stayed low for the softer touch or the firmer grip. A performance that was as much a physical test as it was a display of dimensions.Alcaraz, 21, has been out on the injury carousel for a good part of the season so far, retiring from Rio de Janeiro in February after twisting his right ankle and playing just one tournament on clay in the spring swing, because of a right forearm injury.Alcaraz, who has been practicing with a sleeve, took the court armed with the performance accessory against American lucky loser Jeffrey John Wolf, who goes with his initials J. J. Wolf on the Tour, but it didn’t seem like he needed the support.The world No.3, indexing his tennis miles on Court Philippe Chatrier , came through 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 in one-hour and 51-minutes. Alcaraz had 27 winners in the match, 15 of which came from the forehand side, which augured well for him.Alcaraz, who appeared to be debating with his box during a break in play, perhaps on holding back on power, said the performance sleeve was proposed to him by his physio Juanjo Moreno.“He told me it helps in a certain way. I don't know which way,” the 21-year-old said. “I just wear it because everybody has told me that it helps my mind, just to try to forget everything in my forearm.”The Spaniard, who made the semifinal here last year, sported bright yellow shorts, which helped light up the dank, dismal conditions on a rain-hit afternoon.“The arm is 100 percent. I’m still feeling weird, afraid to hit every forehand at 100 percent,” Alcaraz explained. “It's still in my mind, but I didn't feel anything after the match, which is really, really good for me. So I can say it's fully recovered.”Alcaraz can be extravagant with his shot making. So much so that his shot selection often comes under the scanner, more recently in the opening Grand Slam of the season at Melbourne Park in January where he looked like he had lost a winning hand against Alexander Zverev in the quarterfinals.Alcaraz said this time it was him holding back, and not his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero telling him to step off the pedal some.“Everybody told me that I must go 100 percent on every forehand, but I don't feel as comfortable as before, just to play every forehand and forget my forearm,” Alcaraz offered with a smile. “I'm trying to hit as many forehands as I can at 100 percent, but there are a few of them that I want to stay easy on.”Alcaraz pointed at the workload when talking about the injuries that have dogged the young players, particularly Italian Jannik Sinner and him.“We are playing with so much power. The game is faster. It's more demanding, also the schedule is so demanding,” said Alcaraz. “We can't rest between important tournaments. It's a lot of things coming together because of which players are getting injured.”","Carlos Alcaraz beats Jeffrey John Wolf at Roland Garros. World No.3 wins 6-1, 6-2,6-1 in one-hour and 51-minutes.

"Novak Djokovic has 'low expectations, high hopes' for French Open",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/french-open/novak-djokovic-has-low-expectations-high-hopes-for-french-open/articleshow/110443612.cms,"(With AFP inputs)

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic expressed his mindset for the French Open on Sunday, stating he has ""low expectations and high hopes"" following a challenging season in which he has not yet secured an ATP title.The world number one is set to begin his quest for a fourth Roland Garros title and a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam victory by facing French wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert in Paris on Tuesday.Djokovic's season has been underwhelming, with a 14-6 win-loss record and no finals appearances so far. He arrived in Paris after a surprising semi-final defeat to Czech player Tomas Machac at a minor warm-up event in Geneva, where he admitted concerns about his current form.""Low expectations and high hopes,"" Djokovic told reporters when asked how he felt heading into the tournament.""I almost feel a bit embarrassed to say what my expectations are.""Anything but a title for me is not satisfactory. So it has always been like that. I know it might sound arrogant to a lot of people, but I think I have the career that backs it up.""The last time Djokovic entered the French Open without a title in the calendar year, he was unexpectedly knocked out in the 2018 quarter-finals by relatively unknown Italian Marco Cecchinato.After securing his men's record 24th Grand Slam title at the US Open last year—his third major title of 2023—it seemed Djokovic was poised to dominate the current season.However, he remains tied with Margaret Court for the all-time record of Grand Slam titles, as he has yet to claim his 25th. His bid for that milestone was thwarted at the Australian Open, where he lost to eventual champion Jannik Sinner in the semi-finals.""In a way, me playing still at this highest level, one of the major reasons is trying to write more history of the sport and win the biggest titles,"" Djokovic added.""Paris is definitely one of them.""So that's why my hopes and goals are always the same, but I have to lower the expectations.""When I say that I mean, maybe not thinking too much ahead in advance in terms of the tournament and who I might face in the later rounds, but really taking it day by day, step by step, and really building my game.""Because that's what I have really been struggling with, not really playing in a consistently good level.""Djokovic has suffered several surprising defeats in recent months -- losing to then world number 123 Luca Nardi in Indian Wells and 32nd-ranked Chilean Alejandro Tabilo in Rome.But none of the 37-year-old's rivals can match his experience of reaching the latter stages of Grand Slam events.""I know exactly what I need to do in a Grand Slam environment,"" he said.Rafael Nadal is back at a major for the first time since the 2023 Australian Open and Djokovic hopes to find time in his busy schedule to watch his old rival's mouthwatering first-round clash with fourth seed Alexander Zverev on Monday.""I'll definitely watch. I have obligations during the day, but I will try to catch as much as I can from that match.""I think everyone will want to see what will happen.""The only way Djokovic and Nadal can meet for a 60th time in the coming fortnight is if they face each other in the final for a fourth time.","Novak Djokovic says he has ""low expectations and high hopes"" ahead of French Open. The world number one has not yet won an ATP title this season.

NEW DELHI: Rafael Nadal acknowledges the formidable challenge that lies ahead as he prepares to face Alexander Zverev in the opening round of the French Open on Monday.The 14-time champion recognizes Zverev as one of the most difficult opponents he could potentially encounter at this stage of the tournament.Speculation had been rife that this year's French Open would mark Nadal's final appearance at Roland Garros , a place where he has achieved unparalleled success.However, the Spaniard has since clarified that he cannot definitively confirm '100 percent' that this will be his last time competing at the prestigious clay-court event.Since the beginning of 2023, he has only participated in four tournaments due to a hip injury and a subsequent muscle tear.That left him unseeded for the draw and vulnerable to a difficult opening round at a tournament where he has only lost three of his 115 matches.World number four Zverev arrives in Paris as one of the favourites for the title after winning the Rome Open earlier this month.""Of course on paper it is not the best draw,"" Nadal said ahead of the match on Court Philippe Chatrier.""I play against one of the toughest opponents possible, and at the same time, he came here winning the last event and it's a Masters 1000.""It's not a small one. So what can I do? That's the draw. Just try to be ready for it.""Nadal, who turns 38 in a week's time, has shown flashes of his best form in the clay-court swing, but was thrashed 6-1, 6-3 by Poland's Hubert Hurkacz in the second round of his last outing in Rome.He boasts a 7-3 winning record over Zverev ahead of their first meeting since the 2022 French Open semi-finals, when the German left the court in a wheelchair near the end of the second set after injuring his ankle.""I am not anxious. No, I am focused on trying to play well. That's it,"" said Nadal.""Maybe I go there and I repeat the disaster of Rome. It's a possibility, of course. I don't want to hide that.""But in my mind, is do something different and play much better and give myself a chance to play competitive.""Zverev did not play again in 2022 after that ankle injury but has climbed the rankings again in recent months.The 27-year-old has long been touted as a future Grand Slam champion but remains without one of tennis' four biggest titles.Clay is his strongest surface, though, and he has reached the semi-finals in each of the last three years at Roland Garros.The men's draw looks far more open than usual, with doubts surrounding Nadal's fitness and Novak Djokovic having endured a turbulent start to the year.""I can guarantee you Novak didn't want to play Rafa in the first round and (Carlos) Alcaraz didn't want to play, Jannik (Sinner) didn't want to play him,"" admitted Zverev.""I don't want to play him in the first round, but it is how it is. He has been out injured. He hasn't played a lot of tennis. His ranking is where it is. Of course it's not ideal, but at the same time, you know, there is nothing you can do.""Everybody now is excited for a tough battle and tough first round. I think he's excited and I'm excited for it.""French Open organisers were prepared to stage a tribute ceremony to Nadal to honour his career but the Spaniard was reluctant to endorse such a celebration.""We were ready to press the button on it,"" admitted tournament director Amelie Mauresmo.""But it's Rafa who manages his timing, we follow what he wants. We wouldn't want to put him in an uncomfortable position.""",Rafael Nadal faces Alexander Zverev in the first round of the French Open on Monday.
