Ollie Pope's seven centuries against seven opponents:

Pope's journey to these seven centuries began in January 2020 against South Africa, where he scored an unbeaten 135 while batting at No.6. This was the only century Pope made outside the No.3 position.

He waited two years for his next century, which came against New Zealand in Nottingham in January 2022, where he scored 145. This marked his first hundred while batting at No.3.

In December 2022, Pope scored his third Test century, a quick-fire 108 off 104 balls against Pakistan in Rawalpindi.

The fourth century came in June 2023, a majestic 205 off 208 balls against Ireland at Lord's, marking his first Test double hundred.

In January 2024, Pope played one of the best innings by a visiting batter on Indian soil, scoring 196 runs against India in Hyderabad.

Pope's sixth Test century was in July 2024, when he scored 121 runs against the West Indies in Nottingham.

With Friday's unbeaten 103 against Sri Lanka at The Oval, Pope completed his seven centuries against seven different Test-playing nations in six different venues. This achievement is a first in cricket history.

Playing his 49th Test match, Pope became the first cricketer to score his first seven Test centuries against different teams.Pope’s milestone century led England on the opening day of the third Test against Sri Lanka at The Oval, scoring an unbeaten 103 runs off 103 balls.This performance not only boosted England's score to 221/3 but also cemented his name in the history books.Ollie Pope's return to form was notable, especially considering his recent struggles.

It was his 12th first-class hundred and his seventh in Test cricket. This feat is particularly impressive given the diversity of opponents he has faced.Australia, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, and Afghanistan are the only Test-playing nations against whom Pope has not yet scored a century. With the exception of Australia, he has not faced these teams in his career to date.Ollie Pope's ability to notch centuries against such a diverse set of opponents reflects his adaptability and skill, securing his place as a noteworthy figure in the annals of Test cricket.",Ollie Pope becomes first cricketer to score first seven Test centuries against different teams.

Responding sarcastically to Ashwin’s surprise at Pakistan's struggle, Shehzad mocked the PCB 's handling of the national team and infrastructure projects.Ashwin, after Pakistan's 0-2 home defeat to Bangladesh in a two-match Test series, expressed his surprise.""Keeping all this aside, Pakistan cricket, to see where it is right now, it wasn't possible 10 years ago with Misbah, Younis Khan, even when they used to play in UAE.

NEW DELHI: Cristiano Ronaldo , the iconic Portuguese forward, recently etched his name deeper into the annals of football history by scoring his 900th career goal during Portugal's UEFA Nations League match against Croatia.The 39-year-old’s goal, a tap-in volley from Nuno Mendes' cross, sealed a 2-0 lead, and eventually, Portugal triumphed 2-1. Ronaldo’s emotional reaction on the field, as he hit this incredible milestone, speaks volumes about the dedication, hard work, and excellence that have driven his illustrious career.With 900 goals across club and international football, Ronaldo has set a bar that seems almost untouchable.His tally includes 450 goals for Real Madrid , 145 for Manchester United, 101 for Juventus, 68 for his current club Al Nassr, 5 for Sporting Lisbon, and a stunning 131 for Portugal.However, some footballers are still in the race, albeit at a distant pace. Below are the top three footballers who are chasing Cristiano Ronaldo’s 900-goal mark .Lionel Messi, Ronaldo’s eternal rival, is closest to his 900-goal mark with 859 career goals to date. The Argentine forward's career has been nothing short of legendary, with countless records for both club and country.Messi has amassed 672 goals for Barcelona , 32 for Paris Saint-Germain, and now plays for Inter Miami in Major League Soccer. His international career with Argentina has been equally spectacular, with 103 goals, including helping Argentina lift the 2022 FIFA World Cup.At 37 years old, Messi continues to score regularly, especially in MLS, and his pursuit of Ronaldo's milestone adds yet another layer to their age-old rivalry.Polish striker Robert Lewandowski has been one of Europe’s most consistent goal-scorers over the last decade.With 635 career goals to his name, he ranks among the top in football history. Having played most of his club career with Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich, Lewandowski is now at Barcelona, where he continues to add to his tally.Known for his technical prowess and finishing ability, Lewandowski has also scored 81 international goals for Poland.At 36, while catching Ronaldo seems far-fetched, Lewandowski's legacy as one of the most clinical strikers is firmly established.Luis Suárez, the Uruguayan forward, has been an integral part of football's elite strikers over the past two decades.With 578 goals in his career, Suárez has left an indelible mark on every club he’s played for. His exploits for Liverpool, Barcelona, Atlético Madrid, and now Gremio have made him one of the most feared forwards of his generation. Suárez’s 68 international goals for Uruguay further underscore his reputation as a top performer.Though nearing the twilight of his career at 37, Suárez’s hunger for goals remains undiminished, and he could well climb the all-time rankings before hanging up his boots.Cristiano Ronaldo’s 900-goal achievement has set a monumental benchmark in the world of football. While Lionel Messi remains the closest contender to challenge Ronaldo’s record, other greats like Robert Lewandowski and Luis Suárez are making their way into football’s all-time top scorer lists.However, Ronaldo’s legacy as the first male footballer to cross the 900-goal mark will remain an awe-inspiring achievement, setting an almost insurmountable challenge for the next generation of players.","Cristiano Ronaldo recently scored his 900th career goal against Croatia.

Selectors pick full-strength India squad for first Bangladesh Test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/selectors-pick-full-strength-india-squad-for-first-bangladesh-test/articleshow/113172138.cms,"NEW DELHI: Nearly 21 months since he last played a Test match, Rishabh Pant is set to don the big gloves for India in whites again in the two-Test home series against Bangladesh this month. The national selection committee picked a full-strength India team after having missed senior players during the Test series at home against England earlier in the year.Axar Patel, who was benched midway during the England series makes a comeback.KL Rahul too comes back after getting injured after the first Test against England.Interestingly, the selectors decided to include Jasprit Bumrah for the two-Test home series against Bangladesh this month. They have been looking to groom a pool of fast bowlers after Bumrah, Mohammed Shami and Mohammed Siraj. This approach has led them to pick left-arm pacer Yash Dayal in the squad.Bumrah's inclusion in this series has been a talking point since the Indian team management wanted to keep him fresh for the five-Test series in Australia from Nov. Since Shami has not been declared fit yet, the selectors opted to go with Bumrah's experience. However, sources told TOI that Bumrah's workload will be closely monitored and a call on how many matches he plays in the five-Test home season before the Australia tour will be taken accordingly. The Indian cricket board (BCCI) expects Shami to be fit for the three-Test series against New Zealand in Oct.It is also learnt that the selectors and team management have been looking for a left-arm seam option. Dayal has pipped Arshdeep Singh and Khaleel Ahmed to the spot after an impressive Duleep Trophy outing this week. ""Khaleel has been made to play red-ball cricket regularly since last season. The team management was keen on Arshdeep but he too hasn't played much red-ball cricket in the past couple of years. Dayal has been consistent in domestic cricket. The selectors didn't want to throw young fast bowlers in the deep end. The idea is to give the young pacers exposure around the team,"" a BCCI source told TOI on Sunday.Interestingly, the selectors have not announced a vice-captain for the series. It is learnt that even though Gill has been given the responsibility in the other two formats, he needs to prove his consistency in Test cricket. Before Pant met with an accident in Dec 2022, he was seen as an integral part of the leadership group in Tests along with Bumrah.The batting lineup is set. With Pant set to play ahead of Dhruv Jurel, it's likely to be a toss up between Rahul and Sarfaraz Khan for a spot in the middle order. With Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel both in the team, the team management can have depth in the batting. Again, Kuldeep Yadav seems to be ahead of Axar to play the third spinner's role.",Rishabh Pant is set to don the big gloves for India in whites again in the two- Test home series against Bangladesh this month.

NEW DELHI: While global superstars like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have etched their names in the history books, even they couldn't achieve the extraordinary feat of spending their entire careers at one club.In the ever-evolving world of football , where lucrative contracts and high-profile transfers have become the norm, there remains a rare breed of players who embody loyalty and commitment to a single club.This unique loyalty, seen in a select group of football legends , speaks volumes about the deep connection between a player and their team—a bond built on trust, passion, and unwavering dedication.These one-club legends didn’t just play for the badge; they lived for it, becoming eternal icons in the eyes of fans and securing a legacy that transcends mere statistics.Let’s take a look at a list of such footballers who, unlike Messi or Ronaldo, dedicated their entire careers to a single club, leaving an indelible mark on football history.A name synonymous with AC Milan, Paolo Maldini’s 25-year career is a testament to longevity, skill, and loyalty. With 647 league appearances and a staggering 902 total matches for the Rossoneri, Maldini is often hailed as one of the greatest defenders of all time.Not only did he evolve with the game, transitioning seamlessly from a traditional left-back to a more attacking role, but he was also recognized for his leadership, earning the nickname ""Il Capitano."" Seven Serie A titles, numerous other accolades, and a legacy of grace and grit define Maldini’s illustrious career.Francesco Totti, ""Il Capitano"", is the face of AS Roma. Over 600 appearances and 250 goals later, Totti remains the club’s highest scorer and most-capped player.Despite interest from European giants, Totti’s loyalty to his hometown club never wavered. His technical brilliance, vision, and leadership inspired generations of Roma fans, making him a symbol of loyalty and dedication in modern football.Gary Neville was the embodiment of Manchester United’s famed Class of '92. A one-club man, Neville made 602 appearances for the Red Devils, winning eight Premier League titles and two Champions League trophies.His defensive solidity and leadership made him an indispensable part of Sir Alex Ferguson’s teams.Even after his playing days, Neville continues to represent United as a pundit and ambassador, ensuring his legacy remains intertwined with the club.Giuseppe Bergomi, nicknamed ""Lo Zio"" (The Uncle), was a stalwart of Inter Milan’s defence for over 20 years. He made 756 appearances for the Nerazzurri, winning the Serie A title and three UEFA Cups.Known for his consistency and leadership, Bergomi’s loyalty to Inter saw him become one of the club’s most respected figures, earning a place in the club’s Hall of Fame.Another AC Milan great, Franco Baresi, was integral to shaping the club’s identity. Despite his relatively small stature, Baresi's unmatched ability to read the game allowed him to dominate as a sweeper.Across 719 appearances, he led Milan to six Serie A titles and three Champions League victories. His loyalty was unwavering, even staying with the club through relegation. His number six jersey was retired in his honour, a true mark of his legendary status at the club.""Mr Arsenal"" himself, Tony Adams was a pillar of strength in the heart of the Gunners' defence for 19 years. Captaining the team for 14 of those years, Adams was the epitome of leadership and resilience.Despite struggling with personal demons, including alcoholism, he led Arsenal to numerous victories, including two league titles under Arsène Wenger. His 672 appearances for the club solidified his place as one of Arsenal's greatest-ever players.Carles Puyol is the embodiment of commitment and heart for Barcelona. A versatile defender, Puyol played both as a right-back and centre-back, becoming the backbone of the club’s golden era.Over 500 appearances and countless titles later, including six La Liga and three Champions League trophies, Puyol’s relentless determination and leadership on the field have earned him a permanent place in Barcelona’s history books.Manchester United’s legendary winger, Ryan Giggs, reinvented himself multiple times over his 23-year career. With 963 appearances, Giggs holds the record for the most matches played for Manchester United and remains the only player to score in every Premier League season until his retirement.From a pacey winger to a composed playmaker, Giggs’s longevity and ability to adapt ensured that he remained a key figure in United’s dominance for over two decades.A true Liverpool icon, Jamie Carragher spent his entire career with the Reds, amassing 737 appearances. Known for his grit, versatility, and leadership, Carragher was the bedrock of Liverpool’s defence for nearly two decades.His contributions were crucial to the club’s success, including the 2005 Champions League triumph. His love for Liverpool remains strong, even after retirement, as he continues to serve as an ambassador for the club.Paul Scholes’s career at Manchester United was defined by his incredible vision, passing ability, and goal-scoring prowess. With 466 appearances, he was a midfield maestro, playing a pivotal role in the club's dominance during the 1990s and 2000s.Scholes’s humility and hard work earned him admiration from peers and fans alike, with even Zinedine Zidane calling him one of the best midfielders of his generation.A true symbol of post-war English football, Nat Lofthouse’s career at Bolton Wanderers spanned 14 years, during which he scored 255 goals in 452 league appearances.Known for his toughness and goal-scoring prowess, Lofthouse led Bolton to FA Cup glory in 1958, scoring both goals in the final. His commitment to the club extended beyond his playing days, serving as a coach, manager, and president of Bolton.These one-club men stand as icons of loyalty in a game where transfers dominate headlines. Their undying commitment to their clubs not only defines their legacies but also serves as an inspiration for future generations of footballers.Jimmy Dickinson’s loyalty to Portsmouth was unshakable, playing over 800 games for the club across 19 years. He helped Portsmouth win two league titles and remains the club's most-capped player.Known for his fair play and leadership, Dickinson’s dedication to the club extended to his post-playing career, where he managed Portsmouth and served on their board, solidifying his legacy as a Pompey great.Another AC Milan legend, Alessandro Costacurta played 663 matches for the Rossoneri, partnering with Baresi and Maldini to form one of the greatest defences in football history.Costacurta’s versatility and tactical intelligence helped Milan to seven Serie A titles and five Champions League victories. His loyalty to Milan spanned three decades, and even after his retirement, he remains an iconic figure at the club.A key figure in Leeds United’s success in the 1960s and 70s, Jack Charlton made 629 appearances for the club. Known for his uncompromising style, Charlton helped Leeds win the First Division title, the FA Cup, and the League Cup.His loyalty to Leeds was undeniable, and after his playing career, he achieved great success as the manager of the Republic of Ireland, but his legacy remains deeply rooted in Elland Road.","Paolo Maldini, Francesco Totti, Carles Puyol, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Tony Adams and Jack Charlton are some of the football legends who spent their entire careers at a single club. These one-club legends didn’t just play for the badge; they lived for it, becoming eternal icons.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113171600,imgsize-66850,width-400,resizemode-4/113171600.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant has been named in India's 16-man squad for the first Test against Bangladesh, marking his return to the Test side after nearly 20 months. Virat Kohli , who had missed the earlier home series against England due to the birth of his second child, and Jasprit Bumrah, absent since the T20 World Cup, have also been included in the squad for the opening Test.The first Test between India and Bangladesh will kick off on September 19 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, followed by the second and final Test at Green Park Stadium in Kanpur, starting on September 27.The squad announcement also raised eyebrows with the absence of key players like Shreyas Iyer and Mohammed Shami Iyer’s exclusion comes as a surprise to some, considering his recent form in ODIs and a solid half-century in the Duleep Trophy. However, his inconsistent performances in red-ball cricket, coupled with a difficult 2024, seem to have influenced the selectors’ decision.Earlier this year, Iyer suffered an injury during the Test series against England, which sidelined him. Additionally, his removal from BCCI's central contracts, following his unavailability for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy, further impacted his selection chances. His recent showings in longer formats, such as the Buchi Babu Invitational Tournament and the Duleep Trophy's first innings, were less than impressive.Iyer also guided Kolkata Knight Riders to IPL 2024 title win.The competition for middle-order spots in the Indian Test side has also intensified, with Sarfaraz Khan’s rise and KL Rahul's consistent performances pushing Iyer down the order.As for Mohammed Shami, BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar had hinted at his potential return for the Bangladesh series. However, Shami is still working on his comeback and wasn’t named in the Test squad. Instead, Shami is expected to play for Bengal in the Ranji Trophy, starting on October 11, before making himself available for national selection.There is also speculation that Shami could miss at least the first Test of the subsequent three-match series against New Zealand.",Rishabh Pant named in India's 16-man squad for the first Test against Bangladesh.

NEW DELHI: New Zealand is set to face Afghanistan in their first-ever Test match, aiming to capitalize on the latter's lack of experience in the longer format of the game. This match marks the beginning of a challenging period for the Black Caps , who will play six consecutive Tests in the subcontinent, a feat they haven't attempted in four decades.Considering their less-than-impressive record in the subcontinent (40 losses in 90 matches), New Zealand is keen to start on a positive note.Kane Williamson, a senior batter, has stressed the importance of adapting to the conditions, and with three games under their belt, the team should be well-prepared for the crucial series against India next month.Spin is likely to play a significant role in the match, and New Zealand has arrived with five slow bowling options. Ajaz Patel , who returns to India after his remarkable 10-wicket haul in Mumbai in 2021, is expected to be included in the playing XI.Rachin Ravindra, Glenn Phillips, Mitchell Santner, and Michael Bracewell are also vying for spots in the spin department.While Matt Henry is New Zealand's best seamer at the moment, captain Tim Southee 's recent dip in Test form is a concern. Will O'Rourke or express pacer Ben Sears may be given an opportunity.Afghanistan, who obtained Test status in 2017, will be playing only their 10th Test match. They have lost their last three Tests against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Ireland, but have managed to secure victories against Ireland, Bangladesh, and Zimbabwe in their brief Test journey.The absence of key players such as Rashid Khan , Rahamnullah Gurbaz, Mohammad Nabi, Fazallaq Farooqui, Mujeeb ur Rahman, Noor Ahmad, and Naveen-ul-Haq is a significant blow for the team.The batting responsibilities will fall on the shoulders of Ibrahim Zadran, Rahmat Shah, and skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi, who averages 44.09 in Tests. Seam-bowling all-rounder Azmatullah Omarzai is likely to make his Test debut, while Zia-ur-Rehman, Zahir Khan, Khalil Ahmed, Qais Ahmad, Shahidullah Kamal, and Bahir Shah are the spin options for Afghanistan.With rain and thunderstorms forecast throughout the week, the match is likely to be affected. Despite the disparity in Test experience between the two teams, Afghanistan will look to leverage their familiarity with the Shahid Vijay Singh Pathik Sports Complex in Greater Noida, where they have previously played five ODIs and six T20Is, to put up a strong challenge against New Zealand.The one-off Test match between Afghanistan and New Zealand is scheduled for September 9, which falls on a Monday.The venue for the AFG vs NZ one-off Test match is the Greater Noida Sports Complex Ground, located in Greater Noida.AFG vs NZ one-off Test match will take place at 10:00 AM IST (Indian Standard Time).The Indian fans can livestream Afghanistan vs New Zealand one-off Test on the FanCode app and website and will be broadcast on the Eurosport TV channel.Hashmatullah Shahidi (c), Ibrahim Zadran, Rahmat Shah, Abdul Malik, Riaz Hassan, Afsar Zazai (wk), Ikram Alikhil (wk), Bahir Shah, Shahidullah Kamal, Azmatullah Omarzai, Shams Ur Rahman, Zia-ur-Rehman, Zahir Khan, Qais Ahmad, Khalil Ahmad and Nijat Masood.Tim Southee (c), Tom Blundell (wk), Michael Bracewell, Devon Conway, Matt Henry, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Will O'Rourke, Ajaz Patel, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitchell Santner, Ben Sears, Kane Williamson, Will Young.","New Zealand set to face Afghanistan in their first-ever Test match.

However, Sabalenka's determination prevailed, and she ultimately secured the victory.With an impressive tally of 40 winners, the 26-year-old Belarusian became the first woman to claim both hardcourt majors in a single season since Angelique Kerber achieved the feat in 2016.""I'm speechless.

They then shifted gears offensively in the middle quarters, building a 15-point lead by the start of the fourth period.Despite two of India's top performers fouling out in the final quarter, Lebanon mounted a spirited comeback, but their efforts were thwarted by a sensible play of 5-foot-9 point guard Ankush from Haryana. Ankush scored a game-high 14 points on 47.6-percent shooting to take control of the proceedings after India's tallest cager Mohammad Ishan and skipper Lavish left the court one after the other for committing five personal fouls.Before being fouled out, Ishan and Lavish played crucial roles in India's impressive performance in the second and third quarters, which ultimately propelled the team to a 55-40 lead at the start of the final period. Ishan recorded a double-double with 10 points and 12 rebounds, along with 4 assists, a steal, and 3 blocks, resulting in an efficiency rating of 21. Lavish contributed nine points and six assists. With timely baskets, Sahibjit Singh Bhullar and Mirthun Danasekar scored identical 10 points.The quarter-wise scores in India's favour read 16-16, 19-13, 18-11, 11-22. This two-point victory over the higher-ranked Lebanon also served as sweet revenge for India's 2016 quarterfinal defeat against their West Asian counterparts.India's American head coach Scott Flemming was a happy man. Speaking with TOI, Flemming said, ""This is a great win for India. I was pleased with how we competed. We struggled late with 2 of our top players fouled out. Overall, we outplayed a very good Lebanon team. Really happy for our players.""Explaining the strategy, Flemming added, ""Defensively, we wanted to protect the paint. Make them beat us from the perimeter. We needed to rebound with them. When we made our run, we executed that. Offensively, we wanted to push the ball but run our offences when they stopped our break. We needed more consistency, but overall we did what we needed to do to secure the win.""Though India were outrebounded by Lebanon 53-43, the 26.39% three-point shooting and 68.4% free throw conversion did the trick for the boys donning blue outfits. The quarterfinal will be the biggest test for India as they face the tournament's winningest nation, China, on Saturday.",India beat Lebanon 64-62 to confirm their last eight berth at the U-18 Asia Cup in Jordan.

GREATER NOIDA: It was first coined by the legendary Martin Crowe in one of his articles a decade back. The term 'Fab Four' was a collective expression for four of the best ""young Test batters"" - Virat Kohli Joe Root and Kane Williamson - of that time.The four have gone on to captivate the cricketing world with their exceptional skill and batting prowess in the last 10 years.Crowe had, in fact, drawn their comparison to The Beatles in his article.Interestingly, in the last decade, at varying time points, all four have also captained their respective sides in international cricket.As the four enter the final phase of their careers, the debate still rages on as to who is the best among them with the scales tilting towards all four of them at different points. Recently, Australian women's cricket team's wicketkeeper-batter Alyssa Healy ranked the four, and placed Williamson on the No. 1 spot, while consigning Kohli to fourth.In the last five years, Williamson and Root have been in sparkling form in Test cricket, while Smith and Kohli have struggled to even come close to their golden years in the red-ball format, which was between 2014-19.Root's recent twin hundreds against Sri Lanka at Lord's last week underscored his appetite for runs. Root's twin hundreds, in fact, are as many as Kohli's in the Test arena in the entire period from 2020-24.In this period, Root has 17 Test centuries to his name. While Williamson has 11 hundreds to his credit, the former New Zealand Test captain has played much less than Root in the period between 2020-24. Williamson's average in this period is 67.54.As Williamson himself continues to scale new heights, the affable New Zealander lauded Root for his ""consistent performances"" in Test cricket. Speaking before the one-off Test against Afghanistan here, Williamson said, ""I am a big fan of him (Root).""""He has been phenomenal. He has been something else for a long period of time. Obviously, there is a lot of attention on what he might be able to achieve in the years to come. It's just incredible that the kind of conversion (from fifties to hundreds) he has been able to achieve, can even be had,"" Williamson added, while referring to talks from the cricketing fraternity that Root is in a position to break Sachin Tendulkar 's Test record for most centuries as well as runs.Besides his high praise for Root, Williamson also applauded the other ""two members"" of Fab Four. ""I enjoy watching Virat Kohli, Steve Smith bat in Test cricket. It's just amazing how they have sort of moved the game forward in a big way,"" Williamson said.Williamson, however, downplayed the discussions about whether performances from Kohli, Smith and Root serve as a motivation for him to push harder. ""Not really! Playing for my country, for my team, makes me perform on the field,"" said the 34-year-old.New Zealand, the champions of the inaugural World Test Championship (WTC), will be playing six Tests in the next two months in the sub-continent. Following the one-off game against Afghanistan, New Zealand will travel to Sri Lanka for a two-Test series from September 16-30. Subsequently, they will return to India to face Rohit Sharma 's team in a three-Test series from October 16 to November 5.""In some ways, it's like a tournament sport, even though it's over a long period of time in the World Test Championship. Naturally, having six Test matches together is a big part of our calendar. It's one that we are very excited about,"" said Williamson.","'Fab Four' was a collective expression for four of the best ""young Test batters"" - Virat Kohli Joe Root and Kane Williamson.

BENGALURU: From the selectors' point of view, the Duleep Trophy serves an important purpose, as it allows them to judge the form of top players and get a good look at greenhorns waiting to get their foot on the door in international red-ball cricket.This year, the opening round fixtures were meant to be a dress rehearsal for the 10 Test matches India play over the next four months.Some caught the eye, while others failed to grab the opportunity. Rishabh Pant (61), who did little in the first innings, came good with the bat for India 'B' with a half-century on Saturday. Then top-order bat KL Rahul (57; 121; 4x7) got amongst the runs, albeit in a losing cause.Rahul's teammate Akash Deep also shone, even if his team collectively failed. The 27-year-old pacer, who made his Test debut against England earlier this year, finished with a match haul of nine wickets (4/60 & 5/56). This was before turning in the second-best score for his team, (43; 42b; 3x4; 4x6).Young Musheer Khan 's (181) exploits in the first innings and Pant's crucial innings in the second helped India 'B' set 'A' a target of 275. India 'A' fell short, handing 'B' a 76-run win. The difference really was a plethora of dropped catches that cost India 'A' dearly.With the bat, the spotlight was on homegrown hero Rahul. In his first essay, he had made a patient if laboured 111-ball 37. At the M Chinnaswamy stadium on Sunday, Rahul showcased a glimpse of his preparedness for the long season ahead.In tricky conditions, Rahul, whose career has regularly been punctured with injuries, decided to grind it out for three hours. He waited for the loose deliveries and dispatched them to the boundary. There was little sign of the rustiness and hesitation of the first innings. Kuldeep Yadav had kept him good company, but just when the two appeared poised to pull off a heist through their partnership, Mukesh Kumar struck with an off-cutter that ended Rahul's stay. The top order bat went for a cut but didn't get enough bat and edged it to Pant.Kuldeep went shortly after and Avesh Khan followed him in quick time. The run out of Akash Deep signalled the win for India 'B'. While 275 was daunting on the surface, India 'A' had the quality in their ranks to pull it off. It was not to be.Openers Mayank Agarwal and Shubham Gill , who was thrown a lifeline with Nitish Reddy putting down a sitter, could not make their presence count. Gill would be disappointed with his dismissal - an expansive mistimed drive off Navdeep Saini 's (2/41) after contributing just 21.India B 321 (Musheer 181, Saini 56, Akash 4-60) and 184 (Pant 61, Akash 5-56) beat India A 231 (Rahul 37, Mukesh 3-62) and 198 (Rahul 57, Akash 43, Dayal 3-50, Saini 2-41) by 76 runs","India 'B' beat India 'A' by 76 runs in Duleep Trophy. Rishabh Pant (61) and KL Rahul (57) scored half-centuries for India 'B', who set a target of 275. Akash Deep took nine wickets and scored 43 runs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113178749,imgsize-65422,width-400,resizemode-4/113178749.jpg"

The other coaching staff will include assistant coach Puneet Yadav and bowling coach Nishant Singh.It was during a meeting by the Cricket Advisory Committee on Saturday that the names were finalised.The committee has been appointed by the Rajasthan Cricket Association ( RCA ) ad hoc panel.It will be Bishnoi's (Sr) first coaching assignment after his retirement in 2022. Since the former Bikaner batter knows most of the players and is aware of how things operate in the state, it will not take time for him to connect with the players.Bishnoi (Sr), who made his debut for Rajasthan in 2006-07 Ranji Trophy, has represented Rajasthan in 62 First Class matches where he scored 2788 runs.

The 43-year-old represented Delhi and Railways before playing for Rajasthan between 2013-14 and 2014-15.There are a few 'questionable' appointments, said a source at the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA). ""How can a Rajasthan State Sports council coach Manish Verma also serve as the state's Under-16 team's bowling coach?

"Sri Lanka sniff win against England in 3rd Test, reach 94/1 in 219 chase",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/sri-lanka-sniff-win-against-england-in-3rd-test-reach-94/1-in-219-chase/articleshow/113172783.cms,"Root falls cheaply

NEW DELHI: Pathum Nissanka 's impressive unbeaten fifty positioned Sri Lanka for a potential victory over England in the third Test at the Oval on Sunday.By the end of third day's play, Sri Lanka stood at 94 for 1, requiring only 125 more runs to achieve the win and end a streak of seven consecutive Test defeats by England. Dimuth Karunaratne was dismissed for eight when he was caught and bowled by Chris Woakes after a drive hit his pad and ballooned into the air.However, Nissanka continued his excellent form, remaining unbeaten at 53, having reached his second fifty of the match by powering debutant Josh Hull through covers for his seventh four in just 42 balls.Meanwhile, Kusal Mendis made the most of several loose deliveries to score an unbeaten 30, which included 24 runs from boundaries.Sri Lanka's challenging target of over 200 runs was primarily due to Jamie Smith's superb counter-attacking 67, which pulled England out of a significant collapse. Following a dramatic slump where England lost five wickets for 26 runs to fall to 82 for 7, Smith's determined display at his home ground in Surrey helped them recover to post a total of 156.Smith's innings gave England a renewed hope of achieving a first home Test series clean sweep since 2004, when Michael Vaughan led them to seven consecutive wins. Smith's aggressive approach provided a brief respite, scoring 67 off just 50 balls, comprising 10 fours and a six, but he fell on the stroke of tea, chipping a ball from Vishwa Fernando to short midwicket.Fernando, exploiting significant swing, claimed three wickets for 40 runs, including the valuable wicket of Joe Root for just 12.Lahiru Kumara also made a remarkable contribution, taking four wickets for 21 runs in seven overs.Former England captains Vaughan and Alastair Cook criticized the hosts for their poor batting performance, which saw them collapse from 221-3 to 325 all out in their first innings.Ben Duckett was another early casualty for England, falling for seven after an ill-judged shot off Asitha Fernando. The problems continued as Ollie Pope, fresh off a 154 in the first innings, also fell cheaply for seven by chopping onto his own stumps off Kumara's bowling.Dan Lawrence, having been promoted to open in place of the injured Zak Crawley, managed to score 35 runs, including a six off Asitha Fernando, but ultimately edged behind to wicketkeeper Dinesh Chandimal off Kumara's delivery.As Sri Lanka closes in on a potential victory, Nissanka's role has been crucial in keeping their hopes alive for a memorable win over England in the Test series.Root's square-driven boundary off Vishwa Fernando meant he surpassed Sri Lanka great Kumar Sangakkara's tally of 12,400 Test runs to go into sixth place in the all-time list.Two balls later, however, Vishwa Fernando's excellent inswinging yorker struck Root on the boot and he was lbw.Brook was also lbw to another fine inswinger from Vishwa Fernando.Smith counter-attacked, scoring 20 runs in one over from fast bowler Milan Rathnayake that featured a flashing cut for four and crunching pull for six off successive deliveries.He also lofted Rathnayake down the ground for four before ending the over by punching the paceman through the covers for another boundary.Earlier, Olly Stone and 20-year-old quick Hull did the bulk of the damage as Sri Lanka, who resumed on 211-5, lost their last five first-innings wickets for 52 runs in 16.2 overs, with captain Dhananjaya de Silva and Kamindu Mendis unable to add signficantly to their overnight unbeaten fifties.Stone took 3-35 in nine overs and the towering Hull 3-53 in 11.",Pathum Nissanka scores 53 as Sri Lanka reach 94-1 on third day of third Test at the Oval. Sri Lanka require 125 more runs to win and end a streak of seven consecutive Test defeats by England. Jamie Smith's 67 pulls England out of a significant collapse. England lost five wickets for 26 runs to fall to 82-7 in their first innings.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113173293,imgsize-46810,width-400,resizemode-4/113173293.jpg"
"Weather, ground conditions may play spoilsport for Greater Noida’s debut Test",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/weather-ground-conditions-may-play-spoilsport-for-greater-noidas-debut-test/articleshow/113172348.cms,"GREATER NOIDA: In a significant moment for international cricket, the Shaheed Vijay Singh Pathak Cricket Stadium will become the 124th venue, and Noida the 95th city to host an international Test match when Afghanistan lock horns with New Zealand in a one-off Test Monday onwards. The stadium is the 30th ground and Noida the 23rd city in India to host a Test match.The Afghans are well-acquainted with the Greater Noida stadium, having played five One-Day Internationals (winning three) and six T20 Internationals (five wins) at the venue since 2017.On Sunday, Noida witnessed incessant rain in the afternoon which saw the groundstaff at the stadium cover the ground – primarily the playing area – with blue tarpaulins. The Afghanistan team had trained in the morning, when it didn’t rain, but the New Zealanders weren’t so lucky and didn’t get to practice a day before the Test.Rain has been a regular and perpetual feature in Greater Noida for the last one week. The forecast is pretty much the same for all five days of the Test match, with an occasional thunderstorm looming large. The Test, therefore, in all likelihood, is going to be a stop-and-start affair with chances of getting abandoned not ruled out completely.The stadium, managed by local authorities rather than a state cricket association, lacks the advanced equipment and resources typical of other international venues in India.One could clearly witness that the drainage of the stadium isn’t something to write home about. There are two super-soppers at the stadium, out of which only one was being used to dry the ground. The covers stayed on even after the rain stopped. The groundstaff made attempts to dry the outfield with table fans.“We cannot control the rain, just hope that it does not rain during the match and we can enjoy the game,” Afghanistan captain Hashmatullah Shahidi said.“The match referee has the right to take stock of the field conditions and declare them playable or not. As players our job is to go on the field and play. We are hoping for clear weather and the game to take place,” New Zealand skipper Tim Southee said.It’ll be interesting to see how the Test match progresses, as much-superior grounds across the world, equipped with all the modern facilities, take a lot more to hit the ground running.","Shaheed Vijay Singh Pathak Cricket Stadium will become the 124th venue, and Noida the 95th city to host an international Test match.

Afghanistan skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi yearns for more Tests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/afghanistan-skipper-hashmatullah-shahidi-yearns-for-more-tests/articleshow/113172279.cms,"GREATER NOIDA: Afghanistan cricket has been on the rise. It’s not a slow rise, they’re moving up the ladder at full tilt. The last two ICC tournaments are a testimony to that.In the 2024 T20 World Cup, Afghanistan caused one upset after the other, including getting the better of a heavyweight team like Australia, to reach the semifinals of the tournament where they lost to South Africa.The 2023 ODI World Cup in India saw Afghanistan beat the defending champs England, and former World Cup winners Pakistan and Sri Lanka. A 69-run decisive victory over England was immediately followed by an 8-wicket drubbing of Pakistan. In fact, Afghanistan would’ve reached the semifinals had it not been for Glenn Maxwell’s once-in-a-lifetime double ton at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. Afghanistan had Australia reeling at 91/7 in a chase of 292, before Maxwell unleashed an unbeaten 201 (off 128 balls) to pave way for Australia’s eventual 3-wicket win.In the Test arena too, Afghanistan achieved their first Test victory in only their second match, becoming the fourth team after Australia, England, and Pakistan to win one of their first two Tests. Afghanistan enjoyed back-to-back success when they followed their first Test win (against Ireland) with a victory over hosts Bangladesh by 224 runs in a one-off Test in Chattogram.All the achievements notwithstanding, Afghanistan have played just 9 Tests in their six years at the Test level so far. As per ICC’s Future Tours Programme (FTP), after the one-off Test against New Zealand in Greater Noida, Afghanistan is scheduled to play Zimbabwe (six Tests), Ireland (three), India (one), Australia (one) and West Indies (one) in the 2023-27 FTP cycle.“In six years, nine games is not… I cannot say it’s a lot,” Afghanistan’s Test and ODI skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi said, a day before the Test versus New Zealand here.“If we get more chances against good teams, we will improve. Like with New Zealand… if you see their history of Test cricket and where they are in the rankings right now. Our cricket board is trying hard to give us opportunities against good teams. I think if we get more chances on a regular basis, we will improve a lot. You see, as a team, and as a country, we are brave people, and we always accept challenges.”“If we get a 3 or 4-match Test series, I think it will be very good for us as a side. If you look at our past, we get one Test match and we start preparing for that 10 days before. It’s not easy to play red-ball cricket just like that. Playing more matches will give us better judgment in comparison to playing just in the nets. So, if we play three-four games back to back, I think we will get better,” Shahidi added.Going forward, the Afghanistan skipper also wished for “one good venue”, while they play their “home Tests” in India. While Greater Noida’s Shaheed Vijay Singh Pathak Stadium hosts their match against New Zealand from Monday, Afghanistan have played their home Tests in Dehradun, Lucknow and Abu Dhabi since getting ICC’s Full Membership status.“If you see, India is our home and when we host teams, the other nations have played more cricket here than us. Hopefully, we will get one good venue here in India and we stick with that. If we stick with one venue, it will be more effective for us,” Shahidi said.“If you see our players, they have good record in first-class cricket because we play in our own grounds (in Afghanistan). We know our own conditions very well. So, hopefully, that time comes in the future when teams come to Afghanistan. Then our averages will be even higher than what they are right now.”",Afghanistan play one-off Test against New Zealand in Greater Noida. Afghanistan have played just 9 Tests in their six years at the Test level so far.

But, the most important thing is the process…like while bowling, which are the areas that can still be improved upon,"" he added.Akash, who debuted in Test cricket against England in Ranchi earlier this year, returned to the red-ball format after a break. Despite the layoff, he explained that he had been preparing for the season in his own way.""After my India debut in Ranchi and the IPL, I did not play any competitive match. It's tough to play a game as a pacer after such a long gap, but I have been practicing since last month.""We were playing the practice matches as actual games. So, we had that mindset to get our muscles used to that sort of bowling, and it helped me a lot,"" he noted.India is scheduled to play 10 Tests this season and Akash's performance in the Duleep Trophy has likely positioned him as a strong candidate to support leading bowlers like Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj. However, Akash prefers not to look too far ahead.""Every contest that I play, I consider it as my last. I don't think too far enough. All I have is the present with me.The 27-year-old showed immense control on both incoming and outgoing deliveries here, and he delved into it.""When I started my career, I was an in-swing bowler. But I hurt my shoulder around two to three years ago, and I could not bowl in swings anymore.""It is tough to live with one variation as a bowler and I began looking for options. I switched to out-swingers. And once my shoulder was back to normal, I gained total control on both variations,"" he elaborated.The ball that moved away from middle-stump line to rattle the off-stump of Nitish Reddy in India A's first innings underlined his mastery over the away-going delivery.Akash also remembered how senior India teammate and fellow Bengal pacer Mohammed Shami helped him with the nuances of his craft.""I do take input from him (Shami) as our actions are pretty much similar. I asked him 'how to move the ball out by bowling from around the wicket to a left-hander', to which he asked me not to try for it as it would happen naturally.""It did happen to me naturally, which then became a wicket-taking delivery. It also creates confusion in the batters' mind, as he is used to playing the ball generally outside,"" he explained.Despite Akash's heroics, India A succumbed to India B by 76 runs. He admitted that the batters played some wrong shots and the bowlers did not have the best preparation in place.""We (bowlers) did not have the right planning in place. We should have kept things tighter. Our plan (today) was to play until tea, as things would have become tough in the final session.""But we played some wrong shots in a hurry, leading to a pressure situation for us,"" he said.",Akash Deep takes nine wickets in Duleep Trophy match for India A against India B.

The team management considers the runners-upfinish a big achievement after having rubbed shoulders with top teams, including Kickstart and Bengaluru FC “Of course, every club wants to win the championship. But, for a club that is just a few years old like ours and to battle against much more experienced sides, it (losing out on the title) is not a disappointment,"" said Samir Kamerkar, director and a founding member of the club.Kemp FC took shape after six parents, including five women, came together when their kids and other girls were on the verge of losing game time when a newly promoted Bengaluru-based club lacked the zeal and resources to push the squad into the Super Division league. “The girls in the team were in a state of lurch,” said club president Kathleen De Saran .Even when the same parents, who were pumping money for the club in the ‘A’ division, asked for ownership, it did not materialise. Exploring other options and opportunities, theygot news about another Super Division club, Bengaluru Braves , who were looking for a new owner. The enterprising parents latched on to the chance to attain ownership and rebranded Braves as Kemp FC.“We came together because we had this common goal and love for the sport and also at that moment, the immediate goal was to ensure that these girls had a team to play as they were a talented bunch of players. And our players did well in our maiden season, finishing second runners-up in the Super Division,” added Kathleen, one of the five women behind Kemp. The founding members of the club are mostly working IT professionals and entrepreneurs.Kemp FC, in the brief period, have managed to field women teams in A and B division too.Besides the goal to add to the trophy cabinet, one of their main objectives remains to promote and develop women’s football in the state. In the recently concluded KWL, 11 players from Karnataka were in the squad which also had talent from Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and North East.Having already established their presence with a top-2 finish and getting on to the national football scene, the new challenge for Kemp will be to keep improving and chasing more glory as they move up the ladder.","Kemp FC were formed in 2022 by six parents, including five women. The club finished second in the Karnataka Women's League (KWL) Kemp missed out on the 2024 title to defending champions Kickstart FC.

Malappuram FC blank Forca Kochi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/malappuram-fc-blank-forca-kochi/articleshow/113156067.cms,"KOCHI: A cohesive Malappuram FC came to Kochi and conquered the home team in their den as they registered a 2-0 win over Forca Kochi FC in the opening match of Super League Kerala at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Kochi, on Saturday.Forca Kochi had an impressive array of stars in their line-up, which included Raphael Santos, Nijo Gilbert, Asif K, and Arjun Jayaraj, giving them a formidable side on paper.However, their performance on the pitch against Malappuram FC was below par. Led by the seasoned Anas Edathodika , Malappuram totally outplayed the home side, giving great joy to the fans who had travelled from Malappuram to support the district’s first professional football team. Pedro Manzi (3) and Faslurahman Methukayil (40) scored a goal each for the winners.Forca Kochi came into the opening match after a training camp of just two weeks, while Malappuram, under ISL-winning coach John Gregory, underwent a pre-season camp of a month and a half. The difference was evident on the pitch as Malappuram totally dictated terms right from the start.Capitalising on Forca Kochi FC's sluggishness, Malappuram needed just two minutes and 43 seconds to seize an early lead, setting the stage for a thrilling encounter. Spanish forward Pedro Manzi soared high to head home a precisely delivered cross from Malappuram's Nandu Krishna from the right wing, leaving Subhasish Chowdhary helpless in the Kochi goal.In the 40th minute, Malappuram extended their lead through Faslurahman. Gurjinder Kumar launched a long ball into the Kochi penalty area, which Manzi headed into Faslu's path. The 29-year-old forward slid onto the ball, deftly placing it beyond the goalkeeper's reach and into the back of the net.Despite a couple of attempts from Kerala Santosh Trophy captain Nijo Gilbert, Kochi's forwards were completely neutralised by Malappuram's resolute four-man defence. Brazilian midfielder Raphael Santos, who was once the favourite of ISL sides, was just a shadow of his former self, while Arjun Jayaraj was nowhere to be seen in the picture.Kochi's most promising scoring opportunity arose in the first minute of added-on time in the first half. Receiving a long ball from a free-kick, Tunisian midfielder Said Mohamed Nidhal attempted a header from a challenging angle. Although his effort was successfully thwarted by Malappuram goalkeeper Midhun V, the ball remained loose, falling to defender Dziri Omran. However, the Tunisian squandered the chance as his shot sailed wide off the target.","Malappuram FC beat Forca Kochi FC 2-0 in the opening match of Super League Kerala.

Gokulam Kerala scale new heights at 11000ft,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/gokulam-kerala-scale-new-heights-at-11000ft/articleshow/113155298.cms,"LEH: Playing at 11,000 feet above sea level is not a mean feat. But Gokulam Kerala FC conquered the hurdles that came their way throughout the tournament as well as an experienced J&K Bank FC 4-0 in the final to lift the second edition of Climate Cup at Open Stadium here on Saturday.“It was a very difficult task playing here,” new Gokulam coach Antonio Rueda told TOI even as his victorious wards were very busy celebrating their achievement ahead of a new I-League season.“But the boys were impressive.”However, it was not even a closely-fought match unlike the semifinals when they had to struggle for a breakthrough in regulation and extra-time against a youthful 1 Ladakh FC team that gave their all even as the whole of Ladakh – at the venue or following the game online – hoped for a miracle.But on Saturday, the two-time I-League champions – in Ladakh with their first-team Indian players – showed their superiority as they controlled the summit clash from the word go. Player-of-the-tournament Mashoor Shereef found the net with a piledriver in the 23rd minute before an own goal by J&K Bank 11 minutes later took them to the break with a 2-0 lead.The script didn’t change after the change of ends as Thapuia earned them their third just a minute after restart and Vaseem Imamdar put one more into the net in the 87th minute as Gokulam sealed the game with a 4-0 margin for the hard-won trophy.“Playing here was difficult, but I think it is a good thing to win ahead of the pre-season,” said Mashoor. “This was a good experience and I hope we can carry it into the new season.”The dearth of oxygen makes it difficult for players unused to it to play their natural game for 90 minutes, something that the only Indian Super League team at the contest – NorthEast United FC – would vouch for.Coming to Ladakh with their U17 players and beaten by J&K Bank in the semifinals, NEUFC academy coach Suhel Nair, who coached them at Climate Cup, said, “Our boys are very young and enthusiastic and ran a lot more than they should have at this altitude. A couple of them also needed to be administered oxygen during or after the matches.”However, for 90% of them, it was the first time outside the northeast and was a great experience in a new terrain and interacting with a different culture,” he added.Indeed, the Climate Cup – with its wooden trophy in sync with the tournament’s ideology – did not just provide the most beautiful scenic backdrop to a football tournament in India but also brought teams from different parts of India, and Tibet, in contact with the hospitality of the Ladakhis and their unique culture.And the best example of that was witnessed after the presentation as Gokulam players danced with young Ladakhi boys and girls to the tunes of popular Indian songs as music and sports broke barriers and united people from two extreme ends of the country.","Gokulam Kerala FC beat J&K Bank FC 4-0 in the final of the Climate Cup.

The encounter showcased both players' exceptional tennis skills, but it was also marred by controversy and heated exchanges.The match took a dramatic turn after Medvedev won the first set, as he received a warning for making an obscene gesture towards the crowd.This incident triggered a series of outbursts from the Russian, who vehemently complained to the umpire , Jaume Campistol , about the alleged coaching Tsitsipas was receiving from his father and coach, Apostolos.During one exchange of conversation he was asking the umpire "" bro, are you mad? and his father can talk every point, bro are you stupid?""

He claimed that he did not hear his father's coaching and had previously asked him to stop.Despite the heated exchanges, Medvedev apologised to the umpire for his outburst as he shook Campistol's hand.

outlasts Tiafoe in five-set home matchup,

World No.1

awaits in final

Taylor Fritz , the top-ranked American, likes his chances against world No.1 Jannik Sinner in the US Open final. Fritz, ranked 12, will have the house with him when he looks to end the host nation's 21-year wait for a male Grand Slam singles champion.The 6 ft 5' Californian, armed with a whiplash serve, does a lot of things well on a tennis court, but recently he has sharpened his mental game.The 26-year-old's fight is in top gear as he showed against compatriot Frances Tiafoe in the semifinals where he rallied to claim a memorable 4-6, 7-5, 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 win late on Friday.Fritz teared up during the on-court interview when fellow pro Chris Eubanks reminded him that he would be playing for the title on Sunday. ""I get emotional when I'm happy. I cry at happy endings of movies,"" said Fritz. ""It's just joy, the crowd cheering and that realization, like wow, I'm in the final of the US Open. It's a lifelong dream come true.""Fritz had written a critical note to himself when he lost to Alexander Zverev in the third round at Wimbledon three years ago. 'Nobody in the whole world is underachieving harder than you, you are so f**king good, but 40 in the world,' Fritz wrote, underlining his ranking.Against Tiafoe, Fritz played a splendid waiting game. He knew if he was patient enough Tiafoe's level would drop, especially on the forehand side, and he would have the opening. ""I was waiting the whole third and fourth sets… When is it going to come? I'm drilling balls to his forehand, he's drilling them back, whipping me off the court, changing direction,"" Fritz said. ""Once he started making mistakes, started lifting the ball a little bit more, allowing me to attack more, it calmed me down.""The 26-year-old, who goes into the final with a 1-1 head-to-head record against Sinner, reckons there will be less pressure on him on Sunday. ""It was two Americans in the semifinals (on Friday), both of us wanted to be the guy to make it to the final. It's a stressful situation to be in,"" he said. ""I was the favourite, it's tough to go in with a 6-1 head-to-head record.""""That's different from playing the world No. 1 who you're probably not going to be the favorite against,"" he said. ""I've played well against Jannik. We're 1-1 (head-to-head). I typically play well against him.""Sinner, who ended Jack Draper 's breakthrough run in New York with 7-5, 7-6 (3), 6-2 win in a physical encounter, understands that he'll be up as much against Fritz as the Arthur Ashe stadium that will be packed to the rafters.

Taylor Fritz eyes US Open glory to end 21 years of American hurt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/us-open/taylor-fritz-eyes-us-open-glory-to-end-21-years-of-american-hurt/articleshow/113155665.cms,"Sinner wrist worry

NEW DELHI: Taylor Fritz has the opportunity to break a two-decade drought for American men's tennis when he faces world number one Jannik Sinner in the US Open final on Sunday.The 26-year-old believes his current form is ""good enough to win"" and end the 21-year wait for a male Grand Slam champion from the United States, with Andy Roddick being the last to achieve the feat at the US Open in 2003.Fritz's confidence is high, and he feels that his five-set semi-final victory over fellow American Frances Tiafoe on Friday, a match in which he was outplayed for significant periods, was a tougher test than the upcoming clash with Sinner.""I don't think that I'm going be put in a more stressful situation than I was against Frances,"" said Fritz, as quoted by AFP, the first American man in a Slam final since Roddick at Wimbledon in 2009.""I just feel good. I have a feeling I'm going to come out and play really well and win. When I play good tennis, I think that level is good enough to win.""Fritz, currently ranked 12th in the world, has taken full advantage of the unexpected early departures of Novak Djokovic , a four-time US Open champion, and Carlos Alcaraz, the 2022 winner. Their absence has created a significant opportunity for the remaining players in the tournament.Fritz secured his place in the semifinals by defeating Alexander Zverev, the fourth-ranked player and 2020 runner-up, in the quarter-finals. Prior to that, he overcame Casper Ruud, the eighth seed and 2022 finalist, in the round of 16.His upcoming opponent, Jannik Sinner, has made history by becoming the first Italian man to reach the US Open final. Fritz and Sinner have faced each other twice before, with their head-to-head record standing at 1-1.Fritz won their first meeting on the hard courts of Indian Wells in 2021 with Sinner gaining revenge at the same California desert venue two years later.""I've always played well against Jannik. He hits the ball big. He's like a very strong ball striker, but I feel like I always hit the ball really nice off his ball,"" explained the American, who had never got past the quarter-finals of a major before this US Open.Sinner claimed his first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January and, despite controversy surrounding two failed drugs tests, has advanced to his second Slam final of 2024.He boasts a flawless record in finals this year, winning all five, with titles in Rotterdam, Halle, Miami, and Cincinnati, alongside his Melbourne victory.At 23 years old, he has accumulated 54 wins and only five losses this season. He is excited about not only facing Fritz but also performing before a lively crowd of 23,000 at the vast Arthur Ashe Stadium.""Being in America for sure, the crowd will be a little bit more on his side,"" said Sinner.""But it's normal. It's like when I play in Italy, so I'm going to accept that.""I have my team and my people who are close to me. In my mind, I know that there are many people watching from home from Italy, and it's just take some support from them.”One concern for the Italian is the condition of his left wrist, which he injured while breaking a fall during his semi-final win against Britain's Jack Draper.Sinner needed a medical timeout to address the injury but quickly reassured that it won’t be a problem on Sunday.""The physio loosened it up very fast on court and it went away by playing, which is good,"" explained Sinner.""Let's see how it is tomorrow when it's cold. It's going to be a different feeling. Hopefully it's nothing to be concerned about. I'm quite relaxed, because if it's something bad, you feel it straightaway a bit more.""Win or lose on Sunday, Fritz believes American men's tennis is on the brink of a new golden age as the country boasts five players in the top 20.""I think it gives hope and shows that we're knocking on the door of winning a Slam,"" Fritz said.""We're all moving in the right direction. I think that whenever one of us does something, the others follow, and the others get belief from it. I think this is just the start for all of us.""","Taylor Fritz faces world number one Jannik Sinner in the US Open final on Sunday.
