Justin Bieber’s love for the Maple Leafs runs deeper than any runway

Hailey Bieber turns heads at Met Gala 2025 without her other half



When it’s Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs and your team’s on the ice, even the Met Gala has to wait. That’s exactly what happened on Monday night when Justin Bieber, certified Canadian royalty and lifelong Maple Leafs fan opted for a night of hockey over couture. While Hailey Bieber lit up the red carpet solo in New York, her husband was spotted tuned into the Leafs’ playoff game from home, proving once again that for Bieber, hockey comes before high fashion.This isn’t the first time Justin Bieber has worn his fandom on his sleeve (literally). The pop superstar has long been a vocal and visible supporter of the Toronto Maple Leafs , even designing limited-edition jerseys for the team through his fashion label Drew House. So his decision to skip the Met Gala and stay home to watch the Leafs take on the Panthers? Totally on-brand.Bieber didn’t appear at any Met Gala afterparties either, making it clear he was in full playoff mode. The NHL’s opening round is serious business and apparently more important than hobnobbing with Anna Wintour and Zendaya.Hailey made her own headlines at the Met, arriving solo in a minimalist black custom Saint Laurent mini dress blazer. While she looked stunning (as always), fans quickly noticed Justin's absence. It marked the second consecutive year the couple didn't walk the red carpet together, sparking chatter online about their diverging public appearances.But just hours later, Bieber posted his support for Hailey on Instagram, proving there's no drama, just different priorities. For him, that priority was watching the Leafs win Game 1, even as goalie Anthony Stolarz was hospitalized after a brutal hit.Whether intentional or not, Bieber's Met Gala absence turned into a wholesome moment of national pride. Hailey served Met Gala glam, Justin repped his team, and somewhere in between, the internet got a classic Canadian celebrity moment to obsess over.Also read - “He gets away with everything”: Maple Leafs fans furious as Sam Bennett avoids suspension for hit that hospitalized goalie Anthony Stolarz","Justin Bieber skipped the Met Gala to watch the Maple Leafs play the Panthers.

Can the Cleveland Cavaliers survive without their stars?

Theentered the Eastern Conference Semifinals with high expectations. But their momentum hit a wall in Game 1 against the Indiana Pacers, who stunned the Cavs with a road victory. A key factor in Cleveland’s loss was the absence of All-Star guard, who remains sidelined with a sprained left big toe.With Game 2 looming, Garland’s status is under scrutiny. Here’s the latest on his availability and how the Cavs’ injury report could shape tonight’s matchup.Darius Garland has missed three consecutive games due to a lingering toe sprain. Despite his eagerness to return, the Cavs are cautious about rushing him back.Key updates on Garland’s condition:- Listed as questionable for Game 2.- Experienced significant swelling and pain, per Jared Greenberg’s report.- Participated in light practice Monday but remains day-to-day.Darius Garland’s absence has been glaring. In the two playoff games he played against Miami, he averaged 24 points and 7 assists—production Cleveland sorely missed in their Game 1 loss.Garland isn’t the only concern for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Two other key players are questionable for tonight:1. Evan Mobley (left ankle sprain)- Suffered the injury in Game 1.- Recorded a 20-point double-double before exiting.- Critical as Cleveland’s defensive anchor.2. De’Andre Hunter (dislocated finger)- Injured during the series opener.- His absence would further thin the Cavs’ frontcourt depth.Here’s a quick breakdown of the Cavs’ injury report:The Pacers exposed the Cleveland Cavaliers’ vulnerabilities in Game 1, capitalizing on their lack of backcourt creativity without Garland. If Mobley and Hunter also sit, the Cavs face an uphill battle:- Offensive struggles: Garland’s playmaking relieves pressure on Donovan Mitchell. Without him, the offense becomes predictable.- Defensive gaps: Mobley’s rim protection is irreplaceable. Indiana’s fast-paced attack could exploit his absence.- Depth concerns: Hunter’s versatility helps counter the Pacers’ perimeter shooting. Losing him strains an already thin rotation.Garland’s final status will be determined closer to tip-off. While he’s optimistic about playing, medical staff may err on the side of caution. The same applies to Mobley and Hunter.Also read: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Indiana Pacers final injury report (Game 2, May 6, 2025) - Is Evan Mobley playing tonight against the Indiana Pacers?

The role models girls deserve: How Dwyane Wade’s daughter sparked his Chicago Sky investment



Beyond the sidelines: How Dwyane Wade is helping transform the WNBA



DWade & Angel Talk Dealing With Haters, Sacrificing To Win + A Special Appearance From Gab Union

Dwyane Wade spent 16 years building a Hall of Fame NBA career. But nearly a decade after hanging up his jersey, he's taken on a new role—one as personal as it is professional: part-owner of the Chicago Sky . His 2023 investment in the WNBA franchise wasn’t about headlines or business strategy; it was about family. Specifically, his daughter.In August 2024, Dwyane Wade sat down for an interview on CBS and pulled the curtain back on what led him to the Sky. It came down to this: his daughter, Zaya, deserved the same kind of heroes his son, Zaire, had growing up.“The big part of that is that my son, Zaire, grew up, and he had a dream of being in the NBA. He had a dream of being like his favorite players,” Wade said. “You understand the importance of role models, and so, I want my daughter to have that same feeling.”That idea stuck with him. Zaya , a proud transgender teen and public advocate, didn’t always have athletes to look up to who reflected her identity or the future she dreamed of. Wade wanted to change that, not just for Zaya, but for girls everywhere who needed to see what was possible.Right now, few players represent that kind of possibility like rookie forward Angel Reese . She's brought her signature fire from LSU to the pros and is already turning heads with the Sky. To Wade, she’s one of the bold new faces of the league, confident, authentic, and unshakably herself. Someone like Zaya and millions of girls could point to and say, “That could be me.”Wade’s investment isn’t a passive one. He’s not just sitting courtside and cashing checks, he’s leaning in, learning, and trying to figure out where he can make a real impact. On the ‘Unapologetically Angel’ podcast, he talked about the responsibility that comes with being a part-owner of a WNBA team. And it starts with listening.“I’m a fan of the game, I’m someone who knows the game of basketball,” he said. “But I’m also someone who’s willing to sit and learn and listen.”It’s about understanding what the WNBA needs: more visibility, more resources, more respect, and helping to make that happen. Wade’s goal isn’t to step in and save anything; it’s to show up, do the work, and use his platform to push the women’s game forward.Wade’s work with the Sky lines up with everything he and his family have been championing off the court. In recent years, he’s become a prominent voice for LGBTQ rights , especially through Translatable, the project he launched with Zaya to support queer youth. His activism isn’t performative, it’s deeply personal. And investing in the Sky is part of the same mission: helping build a world where young people, especially girls and LGBTQ kids, feel seen and supported.There’s something powerful about the way all of this connects. Basketball brought Wade fame, wealth, and purpose. Now, he’s using that platform to give others, including his daughter, a chance to dream just as big.Also Read: “We getting a chance to see who can really hoop” — Dwyane Wade backs referees for letting physicality play out Dwyane Wade’s move into WNBA ownership isn’t a career pivot — it’s an evolution. He’s still chasing wins, but now, they’re measured in representation, opportunity, and impact. And this time, he’s playing for something bigger than a championship: he’s playing for his daughter, and for every kid who deserves to believe they belong. The Chicago Sky are part of a bigger vision: one where the next generation of athletes, no matter their gender or identity, can grow up with heroes who look like them. And that future feels a lot closer when someone like Wade is helping to build it.","Former NBA star Dwyane Wade is part-owner of the Chicago Sky.

"Taylor Swift pregnancy rumors—fans think she’s hiding a baby, but insiders say there’s a very different reason for her silence",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/taylor-swift-pregnancy-rumorsfans-think-shes-hiding-a-baby-but-insiders-say-theres-a-very-different-reason-for-her-silence/articleshow/120915097.cms,"Amid a noticeable absence from the public eye, pregnancy rumors swirl among fans (Getty Images)

Taylor Swift rumors prompt expert response on body assumptions

Rumors about Taylor Swift being pregnant have recently gained momentum, largely sparked by viral videos from her Eras Tour and social media speculation . A particular video showing Swift with what some perceived to be a “baby bump” led fans to question whether she might be expecting. However, despite the buzz, there is no solid evidence or confirmation to support these claims.As rumors about Taylor Swift's possible pregnancy swirl, experts are urging caution. Medical professionals stress that it's impossible to confirm pregnancy based on video footage alone, highlighting the need for privacy and respect.Dr. Annie Frenkel, a well-known OB-GYN stated, “You cannot tell from a video whether or not a woman is pregnant. Period, end of discussion.” She emphasized the importance of respecting privacy and not making assumptions about a woman's body based on vague visuals.Adding another layer to the story, Swift was recently photographed holding what appeared to be an alcoholic drink while spending time with friends Brittany Mahomes and Lyndsay Bell. Bell is currently pregnant, and the contrast between the two women in the image led fans to believe Swift may have been subtly addressing the rumors. Many interpreted the drink as a quiet way of saying she’s not pregnant, without making any direct statement.This isn’t the first time Swift has spoken out against public scrutiny of women’s bodies. Just last year, she defended Lady Gaga when similar pregnancy rumors emerged about the pop star. In a supportive comment on Gaga’s TikTok, Swift wrote, “Can we all agree that it’s invasive and irresponsible to comment on a woman’s body?” Her stance was clear: no woman owes the world an explanation about her body, and the public should refrain from such invasive speculation.Despite ongoing gossip, neither Swift nor her representatives have confirmed or acknowledged the pregnancy rumors. Instead, she continues to focus on her music and global tour, showing no signs of addressing the chatter directly.After wrapping up her record-breaking Eras Tour in December 2024, Taylor Swift's plans included spending time with Travis Kelce during the NFL off-season, enjoying some much-needed downtime together.Reports suggest that Swift planned a surprise private vacation for Kelce following his intense Super Bowl season, and the couple has reportedly been frequenting ski resorts where they can keep a low profile. A source told Life & Style, “They’re still very much in love. They ‘re simply recharging their batteries.”“They’ve been hitting the slopes and blending right in.” the source shared. “They love the anonymity.” Aside from their appearance at the Grammy Awards in February, which was one of the only major public outings since the tour ended, Swift and Kelce have kept their relationship largely private, clearly enjoying a quieter, more private phase of their lives.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s legal feud with Blake Lively reportedly destroyed Travis Kelce and Ryan Reynolds’ bromance In conclusion, the current pregnancy rumors surrounding Taylor Swift are based on speculation, not fact. Visual assumptions and social media whispers do not amount to confirmation, and Swift’s past and present actions suggest she values privacy when it comes to her personal life. Until an official statement is made which seems unlikely it's safe to say these rumors are unfounded and largely driven by the internet's tendency to overanalyze.","Taylor Swift rumors prompt expert response on body assumptions.

“Hurts had time for the Met Gala but skipped AJ’s wedding? Something’s off.”

“This man missed the White House for a photo op in a suit and sneakers?”

Jalen Hurts walked the 2025 Met Gala red carpet in true QB1 fashion, dressed in a sleek black suit, his iconic cap in place, and his wife by his side. It was a picture-perfect moment from one of the NFL’s most composed stars. But as glamorous as that New York night was, it didn’t take long for fans to ask the real question: Why was Jalen at the Met Gala… but not at AJ Brown’s wedding or the Eagles’ celebratory White House visit?Philly fans are buzzing, and not in a good way.Hurts kept it classy at the Met Gala with a sharp, all-black look that included a tailored suit, sleek dress shoes, and true to brand with his signature black cap. He posed confidently for cameras, accompanied by his wife, who complemented his look with a stylish, understated gown. For a night celebrating fashion, Hurts definitely made his mark, bringing his calm, calculated style from the field to the red carpet.But that picture-perfect appearance wasn’t enough to distract fans from what they really noticed: his absence from two very important Eagles events.AJ Brown, Hurts’ top wide receiver and close friend, got married recently and many key Eagles teammates were in attendance. But Hurts? Nowhere in sight. Just days before, the Eagles also visited the White House to celebrate their NFC Championship appearance, and again, their starting quarterback was missing.The timeline left fans scratching their heads. As one fan wrote on X,Another posted,The NFL is a business, yes but friendship and team unity matter too. And for someone like Hurts, who’s built a reputation around leadership and brotherhood, the silence feels louder than usual.This isn’t the first time Hurts has taken center stage off the field. He’s appeared in brand campaigns, sat down for glossy magazine interviews, and slowly shaped his image into something more celebrity than just athlete. While that’s not unusual in today’s NFL, the timing of it all is what’s raising eyebrows.Also read - Jalen Hurts’ absence from AJ Brown’s engagement party fuels fan theories: “Nobody likes or trusts him” There’s also been speculation about his role within the team lately, rumors of creative differences, a quieter offseason, and now these missed appearances.

Gujarat Titans aim to recover from the blow dealt by young sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi when they face a struggling Sunrisers Hyderabad in an IPL match tonight (May 2).Suryavanshi stunned GT with his incredible performance, hitting the season’s fastest century in just 35 balls and becoming the youngest IPL centurion at only 14 years and 32 days old.Despite an eight-wicket loss — post a strong 209/4 score — the result hasn't altered GT's position in the league. The Titans remain one of the most consistent teams this season, boasting a balanced squad with strengths in both batting and bowling.Led by Shubman Gill, they sit comfortably with six wins out of nine matches (12 points). Just two more wins from their last five fixtures would secure a spot in the playoffs, reaching the 16-point threshold.GT's in-form top order gives them confidence, especially with standout Sai Sudharsan, who is second in the Orange Cap race with 456 runs and five fifties. Gill (389 runs) and Jos Buttler (406 runs) also rank among the season’s top batters, making a formidable trio despite recent challenges.Earlier this season, GT defeated SRH convincingly in Hyderabad by seven wickets, thanks largely to Mohammed Siraj's impressive 4/17 spell. They’ll be hoping for a similar performance this time.Meanwhile, SRH find themselves in a critical position, needing wins urgently. The runners-up last season have struggled — just three wins in nine matches — and sit ninth on the points table. Another loss could effectively eliminate their playoff hopes.While SRH have seen flashes of brilliance from openers Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head, consistency remains elusive for the team.The pitch at Narendra Modi Stadium favours the batters, which should benefit SRH. In five of the eight matches played at Motera, teams have scored over 200 runs, highlighting the batting-friendly conditions. Bowlers are likely to struggle, particularly in the second innings, as dew is expected to make an impact.Shubman Gill (C), Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler (WK), Sherfane Rutherford, Shahrukh Khan, Washington Sundar, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh KrishnaImpact sub: Karim Janat/Ishant SharmaTravis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (WK), Aniket Verma, Kamindu Mendis, Pat Cummins (C), Harshal Patel, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan AnsariImpact sub: Mohammed ShamiGujarat Titans squad : Shubman Gill (Captain), Jos Buttler (wk), B Sai Sudharsan, Shahrukh Khan, Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Mohammad Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Ishant Sharma, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Anuj Rawat, Mahipal Lomror, Arshad Khan, Jayant Yadav, Nishant Sindhu, Kulwant Khejroliya, Gerald Coetzee, Manav Suthar, Kumar Kushagra, Gurnoor Brar and Karim Janat.Sunrisers Hyderabad squad : Pat Cummins (c), Ishan Kishan (wk), Atharva Taide, Abhinav Manohar, Aniket Verma, Sachin Baby, Smaran Ravichandran, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Travis Head, Harshal Patel, Kamindu Mendis, Wiaan Mulder, Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Mohammed Shami, Rahul Chahar, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan Ansari, Jaydev Unadkat, Eshan Malinga.In Ahmedabad on Friday, temperatures are expected to be quite hot, reaching up to 44°C during the day.

Paige Bueckers says Black women are undercovered by sports media

In a recent interview, WNBA star Paige Bueckers addressed racial disparities in media coverage of women's basketball. To be specific, Bueckers said that Black female athletes are undercover and do not get the visibility white female athletes do.The No. 1 overall pick for the Dallas Wings stressed that Black women athletes continue to receive less media attention than white athletes, even with some improvements. This is not the first time the athlete has addressed this issue. During the 2021 ESPY Awards acceptance speech, Bueckers highlighted the limited media coverage for Black women in sports.Bueckers had mentioned that Black athletes frequently dominate in performance, but their media visibility doesn't reflect their contributions. She reiterated this point in her recent interview and said, ""It's still an issue, every single day. There's not ever equal coverage."" The media coverage gap is particularly clear in the WNBA, a league primarily made up of Black women.Despite this, white players like Bueckers and Caitlin Clark often receive more media attention. Bueckers acknowledged this imbalance, ""I feel like I've worked extremely hard, blessed by God. But I do think there's more opportunities for me. I feel like even just marketability, people tend to favor white people, white males, white women.""The underrepresentation of Black women in sports media has wider consequences, affecting the visibility of their achievements and the stories told about their careers. During the ESPY Awards, Bueckers had said, “With the light that I have now as a white woman who leads a Black-led sport, and celebrated here, I want to show a light on Black women.""“They don’t get the media coverage that they deserve. They’ve given so much to the sport, and the community, and society as a whole, and their value is undeniable. …She further added, “Sports media holds the key to storylines. Sports media and sponsors tell us who is valuable, and you have told the world that I matter today. And everyone who voted, thank you. But I think we should use this power together to also celebrate Black women.”","Paige Bueckers says Black women are undercovered by sports media.

The Test squad departure is likely in the first week of June as some players are likely to feature in the second four-day game, which precedes the intra-squad fixture scheduled for the second week of June.It is reliably learnt that some senior players want to have a hit in one of the unofficial Tests, not the intra-squad game, before the series opener but that would depend on how far their respective team goes in the ongoing IPL coupled with necessary clearances from the medical team. Since it's a long tour, the Indian cricket board wants to ensure that the players are well rested and recovered after a gruelling season of the IPL.This could well mean that the Test squad players will leave in batches in the first week of June. Even for the tour of Australia, players left in batches. Both Dhruv Jurel and KL Rahul, who were part of the Test squad, were flown in early to play the second unofficial Test vs Australia A, to get much-needed game time.Similar drill could be followed this time around, too, especially for the players who are yet to have a taste of England in their career.",India's squad for the upcoming tour of England is set to be picked in two weeks' time.

The All-Star has been managing lower-body issues, including a hamstring injury late in the regular season, but showed no signs of limitation in Game 1.Key takeaways from Haliburton’s Game 1 performance:- 22 points, 13 assists- 3 blocks, 1 steal- Played lockdown perimeter defense- Led the Pacers to a 30-assist team effortHis durability has been a question mark, but so far, he’s proving doubters wrong.While Tyrese Haliburton is fully available, the Indiana Pacers are missing one key player:Indiana’s frontcourt remains strong with Myles Turner and Pascal Siakam holding down the paint, but Jackson’s absence limits their depth.Cleveland Cavaliers’ injury report is far less clear, with multiple key players questionable:Garland’s absence would be a major blow—without him, the Cavs lack playmaking, and Haliburton has more freedom to disrupt defensively.Cleveland’s defensive options are limited, especially if Garland remains out. Their best hope may be:- Throwing multiple defenders at Haliburton- Forcing other Pacers to beat them- Exploiting Indiana’s thin frontcourtBut with Haliburton healthy and in rhythm, the Cavs face an uphill battle.No injury concerns. No minutes restriction. Just a motivated Haliburton looking to silence critics and push the Indiana Pacers closer to the Eastern Conference Finals.","Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton is not listed on the injury report and will play in Game 2.

He made everyone eat their words that he was overrated with this outstanding Playoff performance,” Johnson wrote on X.The billionaire NBA legend further shared, “In the first round against the Milwaukee Bucks Haliburton averaged 26 points, 10 assists, and 5 rebounds. In Game 1 against the Cavs he scored 22 points and 13 assists and in Game 2 tonight, he had 19 points and 9 rebounds.”Tyrese Haliburton delivered a strong performance over six games, showing efficiency and control on both ends of the floor.

Poll What was the key factor in Gujarat Titans' victory over Mumbai Indians? Team's resilience in the face of pressure Strategic adjustments during rain delays Rashid Khan's bowling Shubman Gill's performance

Gujarat Titans (GT) captain Shubman Gill reflected on Tuesday's clash against Mumbai Indians (MI) in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL), highlighting the early challenges posed by rain delays and the tactical adjustments made on a sluggish pitch, while also appreciating the hard-fought win.""There was a little bit of chaos when we came into bat after the train, but always good to have a win on your side.The game plans were different in the powerplay, the atmosphere such that it felt like a Test match. We wanted to take the game on after the powerplay, but the rain kept coming. The wicket was a little bit slow, with the rain coming in, the shots were not easy to hit, so we thought, when it's in our zone, we were go for it,"" Gill said during the post-match presentation.Gill was named Player of the Match for his composed knock of 43 runs.He expressed frustration over the team’s middle-order collapse but lauded the collective effort that led to their last-ball victory, also acknowledging Rashid Khan’s strong return from injury.""It was frustrating; we were ahead at one stage, but we lost 4/20. But the universe gave us a chance before two minutes, and we took it. When the match goes till the last ball, when you chase 150, every contribution becomes important. Wins like these get you through in these big tournaments like IPL. (On Rashid's bowling tonight) He is coming back from injury, it's not easy, he was bowling well in the nets, and good to see him bowl well tonight. Thoughts like these can creep in, but we need to take every game at is. It's about coming in and giving your everything when you come into play,"" he added.In a rain-affected encounter at the Wankhede Stadium , GT edged past MI by three wickets via the DLS method , snapping Mumbai’s six-match winning streak in the process.Drizzle began early in the second innings and intensified by the 14th over, causing the first stoppage. The rain returned after the 18th over, just as GT required 24 runs from 12 deliveries.Despite being ahead of the DLS par score for much of their chase, GT fell five runs behind when the match was paused after 18 overs. But with time permitting, a one-over shootout was staged to decide the winner — which GT capitalised on to clinch the nervy victory and rise to the top of the IPL points table.","Gujarat Titans (GT) captain Shubman Gill reflected on Tuesday's clash against Mumbai Indians.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Scripps National Spelling Bee tweaks its rules to make 'spell-off' tiebreaker less likely,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/scripps-national-spelling-bee-tweaks-its-rules-to-make-spell-off-tiebreaker-less-likely/articleshow/120939239.cms,"Scripps National Spelling Bee tweaks its rules to make 'spell-off' tiebreaker less likely (Photo: AP)





The Scripps National Spelling Bee won't be so quick to force spellers into a lightning-round tiebreaker to decide a champion this year, a shift that follows criticism of the abrupt ending to last year's competition.Scripps has eliminated its requirement that the tiebreaker known as a ""spell-off"" be used when the bee finals are nearing the end of their two-hour broadcast window and a champion has not been decided. Instead, judges will have more discretion to let the bee play out, even if it runs into overtime.""We don't have those constraints in place that will force us into a spell-off situation based on time. It takes a lot of pressure off of that moment,"" Corrie Loeffler, the bee's executive director, told The Associated Press. ""We can keep going with regular competition, rather than saying, 'It's 9:50, we're going to a spell-off.'""Last year, the top two spellers were tossed into the spell-off without even competing head-to-head in the traditional spelling bee format, a move that rankled former champions and other bee aficionados. Bruhat Soma, who said afterward that he practiced the tiebreaker every day for six months, easily defeated Faizan Zaki Faizan returns for another crack at the title in this year's bee, which begins May 27.""Once you reach a certain point in the finals, the drama is really in watching the spellers take on the dictionary word by word,"" said Scott Remer, a prolific spelling coach who works with Faizan. ""Traditionally, the idea behind the spelling bee has been that you use the information you're given, you gather the clues, you process the information, you think about the word, and then you take all of that synthesis of information and you provide a spelling. The spell-off obviously tests a different set of skills.""The spell-off was first used in 2022. Harini Logan beat Vikram Raju during that contest, but only after the pair had a traditional, lengthy duel in which each misspelled four words. Dev Shah didn't need a spell-off to win two years ago, and he was outspoken about the 2024 edition, saying, ""I don't think it was a good bee.""There was no tiebreaker throughout most of the 2010s, and the bee had co-champions in three straight years from 2014-16. Then came the infamous 2019 bee, which ended in an eight-way tie when Scripps ran out of words difficult enough to challenge an unusually strong group of competitors.The 2020 bee was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it returned the next year under new leaders who made it clear they wanted a sole champion.Another rule change has already proven popular among the spelling community: the return of a written test during the preliminary rounds.Spellers who spell one word correctly and get one multiple-choice vocabulary question right on stage will then sit for a 40-question written test at the end of the first day. Results of that test will be used to pare the field to about 100 quarterfinalists - and Scripps will also use the test scores to gauge the strength of the remaining spellers and inform the difficulty of words used in subsequent rounds.Current and former spellers say the written test is a fairer way to move the competition along than doing everything at the microphone during lengthy rounds with wild variations in word difficulty.""I think having a written test as well as oral rounds allows for a better snapshot of a speller's holistic skills,"" Shah said.During the 2010s, a written test reduced the field to about 50 spellers, making it even higher-stakes. Scripps editorial director Molly Becker believes this version, with a ""gentler cut,"" strikes the right balance.""We've heard from spellers that we like the fairness of the test because they're all being examined on the same exact words,"" Becker said. ""Also, the primary driver for bringing back the test is that the program can continue to grow with the number of spellers.""","Scripps has eliminated its requirement that the tiebreaker known as a ""spell- off"" be used when the bee finals are nearing the end of their two-hour broadcast window.

WrestleMania weekend was full of exciting moments, but WWE also made a big announcement that got everyone talking. They revealed a brand-new docuseries called Unreal, which will show fans what goes on behind the scenes in WWE. But not everyone is excited about this idea, especially WWE legend Steve Austin.Austin shared his genuine opinion about the new series and made it clear that he does not like the idea of showing everything. He believes that wrestling should still keep some secrets, so fans can enjoy the magic and wonder like before.During WrestleMania weekend, Michael Cole announced that WWE is launching a new show called Unreal. The docuseries will give fans a close look inside the WWE writer's room and show how the weekly shows and special events are created.According to Variety, the series will have ten episodes, and each one will be 50 minutes long. It is being made by Omaha Productions, NFL Films, Skydance Sports, and WWE. Omaha Productions has also worked on another show called Stephanie’s Places.Many fans were excited about the show, but others were not sure if it is a good idea. Some think it will ruin the fun by showing too much. And Steve Austin agrees with them.While speaking on The Ariel Helwani Show, Steve Austin explained that he prefers to keep wrestling’s secrets hidden. He said he enjoys the mystery and does not want everything explained.“That’s where I’m a little old school on that. I’m a big magic fan, but if Harry Houdini is still around, I don’t want him to tell me how he does it, I want to figure out how he does it. If I can’t, then I’ll keep wondering and keep watching. Don’t tell me how he’s doing it, let’s see if I can figure it out myself. I know it’s not magic, it’s an illusion, but let me keep wondering about that illusion,” he said.Austin thinks that fans enjoy wrestling more when they do not know everything that happens backstage. For him, the mystery is part of the fun.He also talked about his time at WrestleMania 41. Austin was there on Night 2 to announce the attendance, but he did not stay for the main event match between Cody Rhodes and John Cena “I didn’t see it,” Austin admitted. “[Did you go home?] Yes, I did. [Any particular reason?] No, I just wanted to beat the crowd, and I haven’t watched it back. I follow WWE on IG. That’s where I get most of my content. I’ll get the snippets and stuff that they play, and that’s what I see.”Steve Austin loves wrestling the way it used to be, full of mystery and surprise. While WWE is trying something new with Unreal, his opinion shows that some fans still enjoy the magic that comes from not knowing everything. WWE now has to balance both sides to keep all fans happy.","During WrestleMania weekend, Michael Cole announced that WWE is launching a new show called Unreal.

In just 6.2 innings, Sale made ten strikeouts, and allowed only 5 hits, displaying a clear dominance over the Reds’ hitters. While fans thought that it might be a recap of Coors Field, last Wednesday when the Braves lost to the Rockies, this time it was different. Braves secured the win by 2-1, making Sale one of the top players of the match.Seeing his brilliance on the field, fans started praising the player. One player went on to say,referring to the 38-year-old still having higher potential than other young players.To this, another fan replied,Another fan went on to say,While fans are still praising Sale for his achievement, others are hoping that he maintains the streak and brings more victories to the team.Coming to stats and numbers, Chris Sale has maintained pretty good numbers this season.

If things go as smoothly as they are now, the chances of Sale getting another CY Young award will be high.Also Read: Reds’ Tyler Callihan dream start turns into painful setback in Atlanta","The Cincinnati Reds vs Atlanta Braves saw an amazing play from pitcher Chris Sale.

NEW DELHI: In a thrilling Champions League encounter on Tuesday, Davide Frattesi secured Inter Milan 's place in the final with a decisive extra-time goal , leading to a remarkable 4-3 victory over Barcelona , with an aggregate score of 7-6.The Italian midfielder Frattesi sealed the intense match at a rain-soaked San Siro in the 99th minute, following an impressive setup by Marcus Thuram, igniting jubilant celebrations amongst the capacity crowd.Inter will face either Arsenal or Paris Saint-Germain in Munich later this month, where they aim to secure their fourth European crown after emerging victorious from this extraordinary contest.Frattesi, who has established himself as a reliable substitute for Inter, replicated his late-scoring prowess from the first leg of their quarter-final victory against Bayern Munich.""It's just incredible, I don't know what to say. I thought after the Bayern game I couldn't ever feel the same emotions, but tonight was even more incredible,"" Frattesi told Sky Sport.""This has been my career, really. I wasn't blessed with incredible talent, but I never give up and always believe and this is the reward for all my effort and dedication.""The victory salvaged Inter's season following their elimination from treble contention after defeating Bayern.Inter lost their Serie A lead to Napoli, who are now favourites for the league title, whilst AC Milan eliminated them from the Italian Cup.However, Inter ended Barcelona's quadruple aspirations and approach the season's conclusion with renewed optimism, having reached their second Champions League final in three seasons.""We know that there are two really strong teams in the other semi. But you have to play to win any final,"" stated Federico Dimarco.Barcelona must now focus on maintaining their four-point advantage over Real Madrid in La Liga following their missed opportunity for a clean sweep of trophies this season.""The truth is we are sad. We wanted to get to the final, we were having a great Champions League campaign,"" Ronald Araujo shared with Movistar.""We were very close and it got away from us.""Frattesi's winning strike, his seventh this season and arguably his most significant, was particularly notable given Inter's near elimination.With two minutes of regular time remaining, Inter faced elimination after Raphinha completed Barcelona's comeback from a two-goal deficit, establishing a 3-2 lead on the night.Francesco Acerbi stunned the stadium, particularly the celebrating Barcelona supporters, by converting Denzel Dumfries' cross in the second minute of additional time.This unexpected goal came when Barcelona had dominated the second half, having earlier trailed to Lautaro Martinez's brilliant finish and Hakan Calhanoglu's penalty just before halftime.Eric Garcia and Dani Olmo equalised for Barcelona in the 54th and 60th minutes, both from excellent Gerard Martin assists, requiring exceptional saves from Yann Sommer to keep Inter competitive.Sommer produced an outstanding save between Barcelona's first two goals, denying Eric Garcia from a rapid counter-attack.The Swiss goalkeeper proved crucial again in the 113th minute with another remarkable save from Lamine Yamal, who struck the post moments before Acerbi's equaliser.Inter successfully resisted Barcelona's pressure as the home supporters anxiously awaited the final whistle of this season's most compelling match.",Inter Milan beat Barcelona 4-3 on aggregate to reach Champions League final.

LONDON: Over 30 years after Britain's elite Magic Circle expelled a woman for posing as a man to gain admittance, the formerly male-only society is to welcome her back as a full member.The London-based international magic organisation ejected Sophie Lloyd after she masqueraded as a male in 1991 to win membership.But after her story came to light last year, the society's first female chair Laura London launched a search to track down Lloyd and apologise.She was eventually located living abroad and will later on Thursday be presented with a membership certificate at a special ceremony at the organisation's London headquarters.""It is so exciting after all these months tracking Sophie... I can't tell you how happy we are as a society to welcome her back into the fold,"" London told BBC radio.Lloyd posed as Raymond Lloyd for 18 months before unmasking herself as a woman.But members, who voted to admit women in September 1991, were so angered by her ""deliberate deception"" that they went ahead with her expulsion.The deception was in fact a two-person act involving the late magician Jenny Winstanley, who recruited Lloyd to help her prove that women magicians were just as good as men.""I did a 20-minute show in front of 200 people, three examiners, and spoke to the examiner for an hour-and-three-quarters afterwards,"" Lloyd said, recalling how she managed to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.After the Magic Circle changed its stance on allowing women in, Winstanley, who died in 2004, phoned the society to explain.""Two days later we got a letter to say Raymond's been expelled,"" said Lloyd.""We couldn't get our heads round it. We just thought, 'come on it's funny, it's amusing' but they didn't think so and Jenny was completely snubbed, unfortunately.""After the expulsion, Lloyd continued to perform magic for 11 years in an anti-bullying variety show before eventually moving overseas.She said the Magic Circle had changed out of all recognition in the 30 years since she was thrown out, adding: ""This is for Jenny really, Jenny would have loved it.""London said Thursday's ceremony would also be a chance to recognise Winstanley both for her contribution to magic and her audacious trick at the Magic Circle's expense.""I just think she's a wonderful woman and I know she'd have loved to be here and I just wish more than anything I could have met her myself,"" she said.The Magic Circle was founded in 1905 by around 20 magicians at a restaurant in London's Chinatown district.Members must vow never to give away the secrets of magic.Although women have now been admitted to the Magic Circle for over 30 years, they still make up only around five percent of the society's 1,700 membership.The body says, however, that increasing numbers are now coming through in the 10-18-year-old age group.","Sophie Lloyd was expelled from the Magic Circle after posing as a man to gain admittance.

Poll What do you think was the main reason for MI's defeat against GT? Poor weather conditions Sub-par batting performance Dropped catches No-balls bowled by MI

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya described the no-balls bowled by him and his teammates as a ""crime"" following their three-wicket defeat via the DLS method against Gujarat Titans in a thrilling contest at the Wankhede Stadium. In the midst of a tight playoffs race, heavy rain momentarily swung momentum in Mumbai’s favour, with the hosts ahead by five runs on the DLS chart after 18 overs.As MI waited in the dressing room, hoping for a rain-shortened win, Gujarat Titans remained ready for any opportunity.Eventually, there was just enough time left on the clock for a one-over shootout to determine the winner. GT needed 15 runs off the final six deliveries, and Mumbai were left with only four fielders outside the inner circle after being penalised for a slow over rate.Deepak Chahar was handed the task of bowling the final over. He conceded a boundary and then a massive six, reducing the equation to five runs from three balls. Succumbing to pressure, he bowled a no-ball that handed the momentum squarely to the Titans.In addition to Deepak’s costly error, Hardik himself overstepped twice during his 11-ball eighth over. The no-ball troubles weren’t MI’s only missteps—earlier, they dropped a crucial catch of Gujarat captain Shubman Gill on the second ball of the 12th over. Gill miscued a shot off Ashwani Kumar, and though Tilak Varma sprinted in to take the catch, he failed to hold on.Reflecting on the defeat, which ended MI’s six-match winning streak, Hardik said, ""Catches did not really cost us, but the no-balls, with my no-balls and even in the last no-ball, in my eyes in T20s, it is a crime and more often than not, it bites you. But I am really happy with the boys for giving their 120 per cent, ensuring we were in the game and not giving up.""Mumbai's bowlers had fought valiantly after the batters put up a sub-par performance. Despite top-order failures, Will Jacks (53), Suryakumar Yadav (35), and Corbin Bosch (27) managed to take MI to 155/8—helped by some fortunate moments.Jasprit Bumrah and Trent Boult then led a spirited bowling effort. Bumrah dismissed Gill and Shahrukh Khan, while Boult trapped Sherfane Rutherford lbw to keep MI in the hunt.Hardik admitted that Mumbai were 20–30 runs short of a competitive total but commended the bowling unit for their resilience.""Yes, definitely (tough way to go down). We fought well with the total we had. Most of the time, we were out of the game, but we pushed as a group. It was a game of margins,"" he said.""It was definitely not a 150-wicket. It was a 175-wicket, we were short in batting by 20-25 or maybe 30 runs if we had batted well. Credit to the bowlers. They kept fighting, and we could not finish the job,"" he added.Rain repeatedly interrupted the match, and although Hardik acknowledged the disruptions were far from ideal, he stressed the need to adapt.""The ground, in the first innings, was not wet, but post that, throughout, the ball kept getting wetter. Not sure if it helped us or not, it was difficult. Rain kept coming in, not ideal to have stoppages and start again. But the game goes on, we had to play a game (in the end), and we definitely did,"" he concluded.","Hardik Pandya describes no-balls bowled by Mumbai Indians as a ""crime"" MI lost by three wickets via the DLS method against Gujarat Titans.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep4: India vs Pakistan relations, IPL's formation

NEW DELHI: Singer Rahul Vaidya recently found himself at the centre of a social media storm after calling cricket superstar Virat Kohli a ""joker"".Addressing the backlash, Vaidya clarified, "" Mai bhi Virat Kohli k fan hu yaar. Maine ko pagal nahi bola hai, joker bola hai (I'm also a fan of Virat Kohli, man. I didn't call him crazy, I called him a joker),"" Rahul Vaidya said in a viral video.He emphasised that he respects Kohli's cricketing achievements and is, in fact, a fan. But the abuses hurled at his family members led him to take a swipe at Kohli's fans.""I'm a fan of his cricket, but I want an answer as to why he blocked me on social media,"" he added, explaining why he called Kohli a ""joker"".Vaidya’s comment came amid a wave of online drama surrounding Kohli’s social media activity. Kohli had inadvertently liked actress Avneet Kaur’s Instagram photo, sparking widespread chatter.Fueling the frenzy, Vaidya posted a humorous video mocking Kohli’s explanation by mimicking his words and sarcastically blaming Instagram’s algorithm for accidental likes.“Jo bhi ladki ho, please don’t do PR around it… it’s Instagram’s mistake, okay?” he quipped.The situation escalated when Vaidya revealed that Kohli had blocked him on Instagram.“Virat Kohli has blocked me… Maybe it’s another algorithm error,” he joked, continuing his playful tone.However, what triggered a more intense reaction from fans was a cryptic follow-up post from Vaidya: “Virat Kohli’s fans are even bigger jokers than Virat!” accompanied by a clown emoji.The remark didn’t sit well with Kohli’s loyal supporters, many of whom responded with angry messages, and some even targeted Vaidya's family.","Rahul Vaidya recently found himself at the centre of a social media storm.
