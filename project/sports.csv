Chicago Cubs Says The Team Is Not Focusing On Acquiring Alex Bregman Currently And Is Focused “On The Guys They Have In Camp”



Chicago Cubs Might Not Be A “Good” Choice For Alex Bregman, According To ESPN Analyst



Alex Bregman has been a free agent for a pretty long time after he entered free agency at the end of the 2024 season of Major League Baseball. The star player has also attracted widespread criticism after he rejected his former team, Houston Astros’ offer for a whopping $156 million for six years. While there have been strong rumours of the Chicago Cubs being interested in the star player, the team now has spoken about it and it has shocked fans.Recently, the Chicago Cubs had their first news conference and when the executives were asked about the possibility of signing Alex Bregman before the opening day, the answer was pretty unexpected.As per Bob Nightengale, Jed Hoyer, the Chicago Cubs’ president of baseball operations said, ""I think you always look for opportunity, but right now we're going to focus on the guys we have in camp. That’s the plan.""This was not something that Alex Bregman’s fans were expecting. A fan took to X and wrote, “Who really knows what’s going to happen with Bregman”, while another fan wrote, “Bregman is starting to look greedy. Don't even know if I want him back on the AStros.”Apart from the Chicago Cubs, Alex Bregman has also received interests from the Toronto Blue Jays and the Boston Red Sox but nothing has really been confirmed yet and he still remains a free agent.Recently, ESPN’s Jesse Rogers appeared on an episode of ESPN’s Baseball Tonight and warned Alex Bregman to not consider joining the Chicago Cubs.He said, “I went to Baseball Savant, went to the Park Factors leaderboards, sorted by right-handed hitters, and just examined how much of a liability he would be playing in, in Wrigley Field. It is the most difficult ballpark of any for a right-handed hitter to double. Which is basically the most important skill that Alex Bregman needs to be chasing.”The sports analyst also added that it would be better for Alex Bregman’s career if he chooses the Toronto Blue Jays or the Boston Red Sox over the Chicago Cubs.While the Chicago Cubs have spoken about Alex Bregman’s situation and has confused fans more, Alex Bregman has not yet issued a statement about this. Fans and experts have slammed and criticised Alex Bregman for not going ahead with the Houston Astros’ offer for $156 million. But Alex Bregman has remained silent over all of these controversies.With Pete Alonso signing a new deal with his former team, the New York Mets, after initially rejecting them, fans are also slamming their common agent, Scott Boras, for not being able to provide Alex Bregman a good deal.With the 2025 season beginning soon, fans and experts are waiting for Alex Bregman’s next moves.Also Read: Alex Bregman’s wife, Reagan Bregman, celebrates Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl performance, with no mention of Alex",Chicago Cubs president Jed Hoyer said that the team is not focusing on signing Alex Bregman.

How much will Luka Doncic earn with the Los Angeles Lakers?



Luka Doncic’s contract situation has been a hot topic as he transitions from the Dallas Mavericks to the Los Angeles Lakers . Fans are eager to know how his salary with the Mavericks compares to his new deal in L.A. Doncic previously signed a lucrative extension with Dallas, making him one of the highest-paid players in the league. Now, with his move to the Lakers, his contract details are drawing even more attention. Here’s a closer look at his earnings and what his new deal means for his future. Luka Doncic entered the NBA in 2018 after a successful stint with Real Madrid, where he made his senior debut at just 16. He was originally selected third overall by the Atlanta Hawks in the 2018 NBA Draft but was quickly traded to the Dallas Mavericks for Trae Young and a future first-round pick.Doncic signed a four-year rookie contract with Dallas in July 2018, earning $5.5 million in his first season and $6.4 million in his second. His early years with the Mavericks set the stage for his rise as one of the league’s top players.Doncic secured a historic five-year rookie extension worth $215.16 million, the largest in NBA history at the time. The deal averaged $43 million per season, starting at $37.1 million in his first year and increasing to $43 million by the 2024-25 season.Doncic’s move to the Los Angeles Lakers comes with financial trade-offs, as he will earn less than he could have with the Mavericks. Under NBA rules, a player must stay with their original team to qualify for a supermax extension . By leaving Dallas, Doncic forfeited the chance at a five-year, $345 million deal tied to 30% of the salary cap.Still, his earning potential remains strong. If he renegotiates this summer, he could sign a four-year, $228 million extension. Combined with the $43 million left on his current deal, his total contract value would reach $271 million.Doncic has made his Lakers debut sharing the court alongside LeBron James and the Co. His debut was highly anticipated but fans were also curious about the current state of his salary in the new team. Still, the five-time NBA All-Star is one of the highest-paid stars in the league.Also Read: Inside NBA's Most Shocking Trade: Los Angeles Lakers Prioritizing Luka Doncic Is Not Going Unnoticed by LeBron James' Camp Currently, Doncic sits with a stunning $58 million fortune (according to Forbes).

""Once I got the news that we got Pete back -- big smile on my face. I'm excited to have Pete back and what the team was able to do this offseason. I can't wait to get going.

Earlier this month, the New York Mets succeeded in re-signing their star player Pete Alonso . While most fans were happy about Alonso's return to the Mets, MLB critics like Bob Nightengale found him among the ""losers"" of the offseason. In his recent report, the MLB insider talked in detail about his controversial take.On Sunday, Bob Nightengale released a report with USA Today, during which he talked about his reasons for finding Pete Alonso as one of the ""losers"" of the offseason. According to Nightengale, Alonso rejected multiple great offers just to settle for an underpaying one. Talking about the same in his report, Nightengale said:Bob Nightengale's statement makes complete sense, considering how Pete Alonso and his agent rejected multiple great offers from the Mets and ended up settling for a much lower-valued contract. It could be the reason why the Mets find Jose Iglesias a ""more valuable player"" than Alonso.Apart from the fans, NY Mets manager Carlos Mendoza recently shared his feelings on Pete Alonso's re-signing. Sharing his reaction during an interview with MLB Network Radio, Mendoza said:Pete Alonso has been reported to start behind Juan Soto, and according to former Mets star Chris Gimenez , it will help Alonso become a ""better version of himself"" going into the 2025 MLB season.",MLB analyst Bob Nightengale finds Pete Alonso as offseason 'looser' after turning down $71 Million deal for $54 Million with NY Mets.

Trump Taylor Swift Relationship: Why Brittany Mahomes and Taylor Swift Stayed Apart at the Super Bowl—The Political Drama Behind the Scenes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-brittany-mahomes-and-taylor-swift-stayed-apart-at-the-super-bowlthe-political-drama-behind-the-scenes/articleshow/118149084.cms,"David Eulitt/Getty Images

Brittany Mahomes Was Told to Avoid Taylor Swift at the Super Bowl—The Trump Factor Explained

Brittany kept her distance from Taylor because of Trump attending the game,

She was instructed to do so.""

""The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift... She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!""

""Brittany is a pawn in Trump's game to get into her circle,""

""Trump knows about their friendship and will take any cheap shot he can at Taylor.""

Brittany Mahomes and Taylor Swift had been inseparable throughout the NFL season, cheering on their partners, Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, like the ultimate hype duo. But when the Kansas City Chiefs took the field at Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans, something was off. The two weren’t side by side, laughing and toasting like they had been all season. Instead, Swift was in her VIP suite with Ice Spice and the Haim sisters, while Brittany was nowhere in sight.So, what changed? Turns out, it wasn’t just bad seat planning—politics and a certain former president might have had something to do with it.According to reports, Brittany Mahomes was given strict instructions to keep her distance from Swift, all because Donald Trump was in attendance. The fear? That their friendship could somehow become a political distraction. Trump has had a long history of taking shots at Swift, especially after she endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 election."" a source revealed. ""And the concern wasn’t unfounded. When Swift was shown on the jumbotron, boos erupted from parts of the crowd. She exchanged a side-eye with her friends, clearly taken aback. Trump wasted no time chiming in, later posting on Truth Social:It’s no secret that Trump has been using Swift’s name as political ammo, and Brittany, knowingly or not, has been pulled into that mess.Adding another layer to the drama, Brittany Mahomes had previously liked a social media post that outlined Trump’s policies. While she never explicitly endorsed him, the internet took notice, and some Swifties weren’t too happy about it. Swift, on the other hand, has been vocal about her political beliefs, and the idea of the two being spotted together with Trump in the building could have been a PR headache waiting to happen.an insider explained.With all of that swirling in the background, keeping a little distance suddenly made a lot of sense.Despite the Super Bowl separation, Brittany and Swift still appear to be on good terms. Brittany was at Swift’s 35th birthday bash, and the two hung out before the big game with their partners. But going forward, it looks like their friendship might have to navigate more than just football season—it’s now tangled up in political narratives neither of them may have expected.Whether or not Trump continues to take jabs at Swift, one thing’s for sure—this year’s Super Bowl wasn’t just about football. It was a whole political spectacle, and Brittany Mahomes just found herself right in the middle of it.Also read - Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl Halftime Show Was a Real-Life PlayStation Game—Here’s What It All Meant","Brittany Mahomes and Taylor Swift had been inseparable throughout the NFL season.

Embiid’s status, attributed to “injury management,” leaves fans and analysts speculating about his availability and its potential impact on the team’s performance.Joel Embiid, a cornerstone of the 76ers’ lineup, has been instrumental in their success this season. His absence or limited participation could significantly affect Philadelphia’s chances against the Raptors, who are also dealing with their own injury concerns. The 76ers are already navigating a challenging season, sitting at 20-32, and losing Embiid, even temporarily, would be a major blow.The injury report also highlights other key absences for the 76ers. Jared McCain is out for the season with a meniscus injury, while Kyle Lowry remains sidelined with a hip issue. Eric Gordon is also questionable due to a wrist injury, further thinning Philadelphia’s roster.Despite these setbacks, the 76ers have seen standout performances from Tyrese Maxey, who ranks fourth in the NBA with 28.1 points per game. Kelly Oubre Jr. has also been a consistent contributor, averaging 6.5 rebounds per game.

Tyler Matzek signs a minor league contract with the New York Yankees

Fans react to Tyler Matzek’s minor league deal with the Yankees

“Interesting move. The Yankees bullpen seems pretty set. I've got to imagine this is a minor-league deal with an invite to spring training. The Yankees only have one lefty in their 'pen right now in Tim Hill. Could be an interesting depth move.”

“Ohhhhhh Chris.”

“Lets gooooo.”

“Brankees are becoming a real thing wow!”

Luke Doncic gets a loud and warm welcome on his LA Lakers debut



Luka Doncic shares his thoughts after the debut



Luka Doncic just made his LA Lakers debut against the Utah Jazz, scoring 14 points in 24 minutes. It was a special night for the young talent, who had to uproot his whole family out of Dallas to make a home in the glitz and glamour of Los Angeles recently. While official confirmation came almost a week back, Doncic was out because of a calf strain and taking his time to adjust to his new team. But now he is ready to start his journey and we are all equally excited. Luka Doncic has finally played his debut match for the Lakers, and the deafening cheer that accompanied his name while introductions were being made, made the night all the more special. It was amazing to see him in the gold and purple uniform as Doncic scored 14 points, 5 rebounds, and 4 assists in 24 minutes. LeBron James led the team to a 132-113 win against the Utah Jazz, with a score of 24 points. But the anticipation of seeing Luka on the court, along with his new teammates, including James, trumped all. The two teams will have another face-off before the All-Star Weekend starts, so we can have another front-row seat to how Doncic performs now that the pressure of the debut is gone from his shoulders.Luka Doncic talked to an ESPN correspondent to share what it felt like playing in the Lakers uniform for the very first time. He said that ""it was a special moment"" for him to hear them chanting his name so loudly and supporting him from the very start.He was also thankful to everyone on the team and his camp for being there for him through all this. It was a special moment, not just for him, but also for the fans. And those who got to attend the game had a special gift - a Doncic Lakers T-shirt.Also Read: Luka Doncic’s Dallas Mavericks Salary Vs His New Los Angeles Lakers Deal: A Complete Breakdown","Luka Doncic scored 14 points, 5 rebounds, and 4 assists in 24 minutes.

WWE is on the move towards its biggest show of sports entertainment, WrestleMania 41, taking place at the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas on April 19 and 20 this year. The road to the Show of Shows officially kicked off at the Royal Rumble Premium Live Event with one mega match highly rumored to take place at WrestleMania this year.According to multiple reports and speculations, John Cena is expected to face Cody Rhodes for the Undisputed WWE Championship. Despite Cena not winning the Men's Royal Rumble, fan speculation and recent events hint at the fact that past and present faces of WWE will collide at WrestleMania this year. Here are the three reasons John Cena vs Cody Rhodes now seems inevitable for WrestleMania 41:WWE is known to set one of the best match cards for WrestleMania each year, with plans already in motion months before the event takes place. According to a new report by Dave Meltzer, the plan for John Cena was never to win the Royal Rumble match. Instead, The Cenation Leader has been slated to win the Elimination Chamber match since October or November last year to earn the right to face Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 41. Cena announced himself for the match on the Royal Rumble post-show, and it will be his final chance to earn the opportunity to main event his final WrestleMania as an in-ring competitor.WrestleMania has always been about producing some of the greatest in-ring showdowns between top-tier WWE superstars of all time. John Cena has been credited as one of the greatest WWE superstars of all time who led the charge for more than a decade as the face of WWE. On the other hand, Cody Rhodes is now the company's flagship star after winning the big one last year at WrestleMania. The clash between the past and present of WWE would surely be a huge draw for the company at The Showcase of the Immortals.The possibility of a John Cena vs Cody Rhodes match has become more real with Jey Uso finally revealing his decision for WrestleMania. The 2025 Men's Royal Rumble winner announced on the February 10the 2025 edition of RAW that he would battle Gunther for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 41. With Jey making his choice and reports of WWE wanting to create memorable moments like Cena's 17th World title win, the clash with Cody Rhodes is looking to be set in stone now.","The highly anticipated showdown between Cody Rhodes and John Cena seems more set in stone than ever now for the Grandest Stage of Them All, WrestleMania 41.

Kenley Jansen Swaps Red Sox for Angels, Bringing a Fresh Spark to the West Coast!



Kenley Jansen 2024 Highlights!

Kenley Jansen, the man with the legendary beard and clutch closing chops, is making his grand return to California, albeit not quite in the way most fans might've expected. After two seasons of dazzling (and sometimes scaring) the faithful in Fenway Park, Jansen is reportedly going to sign a one-year, $10 million deal with the Los Angeles Angels . That is correct; once-been Boston Red Sox closer Kenley Jansen is going back to the sunshine—just not with the Dodgers.The 37-year-old right-handed pitcher has been pretty much cemented on the mound for more years than we can probably account for, but now the guy's back on the coast he once called home. Having spent a hefty chunk of his career as a bullpen mainstay for the Dodgers, Jansen is now headed toward new blue and red territory as he trades in Dodger Stadium for Angel Stadium. A move that is exciting, yet also surprising—everybody thought the Dodgers would swoop in for Jansen after that impressive run over there in Boston. But here are their rivals in L.A. with their very interesting plan.Jansen's two years on the Red Sox were by no means all rainbows and flowers-off-the-wall; however, he surely contributed his part to it. In 2022 and 2023, Jansen notched 56 saves and a respectable 3.44 ERA. He made his fourth All-Star selection in his first year with Boston, but injuries intervened to cause turbulence in what had otherwise been a smooth-sailing career in his second year. Enter Liam Hendriks into the Boston bullpen, thereby effectively allowing the Red Sox to let Jansen slip away into free agency.To the Angels, this move should be viewed as quite brilliant in nature. They have indeed added one of the best closers in the game-playoff pedigree, a nasty cutter, and that sort of swagger a seasoned vet brings. Jansen will join the choir of a bullpen looking for some stability. Many might have guessed a return to his hometown with the Dodgers, but the Angels came in and nabbed him so they could enjoy the fireworks from the closer's mound.All eyes will be on the Angels come 2025, as Jansen brings his arm, leadership, and grizzled experience to a team starved for a postseason berth. The West Coast is ablaze with expectation, and Jansen? Well, he is ready to bring that closer magic back to LA-just a different flavor of blue.","The 37-year-old right-handed pitcher has been pretty much cemented on the mound for more years than we can probably account for. Many might have guessed a return to his hometown with the Dodgers, but the Angels came in and nabbed him so they could enjoy the fireworks from the closer's mound.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118153002,imgsize-19564,width-400,resizemode-4/118153002.jpg"

Former NBA starhas all the reasons to believe thathas found his dream team. Wade thinks Butler would be a perfect fit for the. In a recent discussion, the NBA legend shared his candid thoughts on why Butler’s skill set and mentality align with the team’s fast-paced system.

In his latest episode of The Why With Dwyane Wade, the 43-year-old showered praise for the veteran. ""I mean, this is a three-year play. This an all-in, probably for the next three years in Golden State,” Dwyane Wade shared in his podcast while discussing Butler’s recent Warriors debut.“When you got one of the greatest players to ever put on a jersey, it is your duty to make sure they have an opportunity when they say 'I need more,' to make sure you give him more. And so obviously, they tried to pull off other moves, but this is the move they end up getting,"" Wade added.Wade further asserted that fans will see a new version of Butler as he expects the six-time All-Star will make his move in the roster in The Bay. ""I go back to the Jimmy I knew in Marquette, the Jimmy I knew in Chicago at first before he became an All-Star Jimmy,” Wade continued.“The Jimmy that is just like a wild dog off the leash because he can now just be Jimmy. He don't have to worry about scoring 56 this night. Now he can, but now he can just be a wild dog off the leash. And that Jimmy is different. That Jimmy can be different, so I'm excited about that,"" he added.Certainly, Butler’s addition to the Warriors is an aid to Stephen Curry and Draymond Green.

WNBA Team Indiana Fevers Add Experience to Their Roster as Forward DeWanna Bonner Joins the Team,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/wnba-team-indiana-fevers-add-experience-to-their-roster-as-forward-dewanna-bonner-joins-the-team/articleshow/118147790.cms,"(Image Via Getty)

Caitlin Clark is quite happy with how Indiana Fevers is trying to improve its roster



DeWanna Bonner addresses her heated courtside exchange with Caitlin Clark



Caitlin Clark is currently one of the biggest stars in the WNBA. And although she had a phenomenal season, it wasn't enough to get the Indiana Fevers to the finals. The roster was the main concern, and the Fevers management is doing all they can to improve it. Forward DeWanna Bonner just joined the Fevers from the Connection Suns. They have also signed another forward, Natasha Howard , who joined the team from Cukurova Basketbol. And Clark seems pretty happy about the new joiners.Indiana Fevers are a young team, and though they have spirit and vigor, they lack in experience. This is probably why they were cut off during the Playoffs and the reason this trading season has seen the team bring in players who can add their experience in the training room as well as the court. Players like DeWanna Bonner and Natasha Howard are good additions to the team and have about 26 years of playing experience among them. Caitlin Clark , who is their star member, thinks having these players with them is a big plus for the Fevers. Clark said,“They know what it takes to win, they know what it takes to get to the Finals, they know what it takes to win championships. I think it’s exactly what we needed in our locker room.""And she is right. DeWanna Bonner is a six-time WNBA All-Star and two-time WNBA Champion. Howard, on the other hand, is a two-time WNBA All-Star and a three-time WNBA Champion. Having them in the team can only be a good thing for the Fevers.After signing a one-year deal during the offseason, Bonner is officially a member of the Indiana Fevers team. This might come as a surprise to some in light of the fact that she and Fevers star Caitlin Clark had a heated exchange during a game last season. Clark had complained of being fouled by the then-Connecticut Suns player, which led to some heated words being exchanged between the two before Clark shoved Bonner.But now that they are both going to play for the Fevers, Bonner has no ill feelings for her younger teammate. After the signing, she was asked about it, to which she laughingly said:""I'm glad you asked that question because my inbox has been going crazy about that moment. I think it's just two competitive players who want to win and push their team to get over the finish line. It was the playoffs, so emotions are high, tensions are high.""They have already met to train, and it's been all good so far. Bonner further added:""I think we just feed well off each other. I'm just here to hopefully give my leadership advice. I don't think I need to push her to be any type of player that she isn't already is, and I'm just happy to be here and I hope I can give her some knowledge to bring her game to a different level.""Her experience would be very valuable for a young team like the Fevers, who desperately need some guidance from players who have been at it for as long as Bonner and Howard have. It will be exciting to see how these new additions change the gameplay for the Fevers and if it helps them in the long run.Also Read: NBA and WNBA at the Met Gala 2025: LeBron James and Angel Reese To Channel Their Inner Miranda Priestly",DeWanna Bonner joined the Indiana Fevers from the Connection Suns.

On playing the six-player Norway elite meet from May 26:

CHENNAI: Grandmaster Arjun Erigaisi has flirted with a Candidates Tournament spot more than once, always within striking distance but never quite over the line. In December last year, he came agonisingly close at the World Rapid Chess Championship in New York, only to fall short once again. Yet, 2025 feels different to him.The 21-year-old believes he's stronger, sharper, and ready to turn those near misses into a breakthrough. In an interview with TOI, Erigaisi spoke about his near misses, handling pressure.Yeah, it was a near miss. But it's not the only spot - there are still seven more. Of course, it would have been nice to qualify. But I have a feeling this year is going to bring a different result.It didn't pressurise me as such. I think I played decently here. Last time, in 2023, it was very hurtful. Now, I don't look at it as pressure. I feel that two years ago, I was already very close, and now that I'm much stronger, I believe I will definitely be able to qualify this year.Of course, my main focus right now is to qualify for Candidates. The Tata Steel Chess event in Wijk aan Zee had many takeaways for me. Uzbek trainer Rustam Kasimdzhanov is my coach. I'll try my best to get stronger.I played horribly in the tournament. It was still a really bad event. Winning a couple of games was nice, but beating the world champion didn't change much for me.I am excited about it. There will be more exciting chess as players will take more risks.","Arjun Erigaisi has flirted with a Candidates Tournament spot more than once.

Brief Scores:

KOLKATA: Mumbai got an unlikely hero in Royston Dias as the pacer's five-wicket haul helped them set up a semifinal clash with Vidarbha after beating Haryana by 152 runs in the Ranji Trophy quarterfinal at the Eden Gardens on Tuesday.Haryana did well to pick up the six Mumbai wickets for just 75 runs to wrap up their second innings for 339 in the first session of play on Day Four.They had enough time to chase down 354 runs for victory, but Mumbai bowlers came hard at them to bowl them out for 201 in the next two sessions to script a dominant win.Earlier, Skipper Ajinkya Rahane (108, 180b; 13x4) got his maiden Ranji century this season in his 200th first-class match before right-arm pacer Anuj Thakral (4/70) struck by dismissing him and Shivam Dube (48) in his consecutive overs-both caught behind while trying to play away from the body.Pacers Sumit Kumar (2/65) and Anshul Kamboj (2/57) utilised the second new ball well to wrap up the Mumbai tail in quick time giving Haryana a chance.But Mumbai has other plans as Shardul Thakur (3/26) drew the first blood by trapping first innings centurion and Haryana skipper Ankit Kumar in front for 11 just before the lunch break.Shardul's 10-over opening spell, spread across the pre and post-lunch sessions, actually broke the backbone of Haryana's chase. The pacer finished with match figures of 9/84 and was judged Man of the Match.Haryana did put up a resistance when Lakshay Dalal (64, 130b; 9x4) and Sumit Kumar (62, 96b; 10x4) scripted a 90-run stand for the sixth wicket, but it was Dias who did the damage after the tea interval. Haryana's last five wickets tumbled in the final hour with Dias producing a career-best 5/39 in 10.3 overs.The left-arm pacer, who is not a regular in the Mumbai side, was happy to bag his maiden fifer after playing for nine-long years.""I have got opportunity only when somebody is out injured or is picked for the national side. So every game that I have played, I had taken it as my last one and gave my best. I think that has helped me to keep performing,"" the 32-year-old stated.However, he felt lucky to get advice from players like Shardul or Dhawal Kulkarni ""They are more like my brothers. Even today Shardul told me that the ball was not doing much and that's why I tried to test the batters with change in line of my deliveries,"" he said.Skipper Rahane gave credit to the whole team. ""I am happy to see everybody contributing and raising their hands when required,"" he stated.Mumbai 315 & 339 in 85.3 overs (Ajinkya Rahane 108, Shivam Dube 48; Anuj Thakral 4/70) bt Haryana 301 & 201 in 57.3 overs (Lakshay Dalal 64, Sumit Kumar 62; Royston Dias 5/39, Shardul Thakur 3/26) by 152 runs",Defending champions beat Haryana by 152 runs in Ranji Trophy quarterfinal.

Serena Williams' priceless reaction to being asked to perform at the Super Bowl



Tennis star Serena Williams performed alongside Kendrick Lamar during the Super Bowl halftime show for Drake's ""Not Like Us"" diss track, serving as a unique crossover. Williams' brief appearance on television on Sunday was a thrilling surprise, as it was the second-most exciting surprise of the night, following the Philadelphia Eagles' 24-0 halftime lead over the Kansas City Chiefs.Serena Williams opened up about how she got the cameo in an emotional post on social media on Tuesday, ""When @kendricklamar and team called and was like ‘we’ve been trying to do something forever, what about this? We loved your crip walk at the Olympics after you won the gold medal,’” Williams wrote on Instagram.She continued, ""I’m like Super Bowl? Are you serious? When in the world would I ever be able to dance at a super bowl? (Never) let’s do it!” Williams also shared a behind-the-scenes video of practicing the infamous crip walk with her daughter Olympia and choreographers before the big game.The 23-time Grand Slam champion admitted after her Super Bowl halftime appearance that she would have been fined at Wimbledon if she performed certain dance moves on the tennis court. But, as Williams stated in her recent Instagram post, “I knew my winning dance after the @olympics would pay off one day. End of story.”However, Williams’ field choreography during Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime show has caused some backlash. Former NFL player Ryan Clark, a guest on the “First Take” podcast, pointed out that Williams’ performance went beyond a petty rivalry. “She’s from Compton,” Clark reminded Stephen A. Smith and Shannon Sharpe.“We know that,” Smith replied to Clark. “Even if she’s not from Compton, everybody knows her and Drake were together at one time,” Sharpe said, adding that the performance was an attempt to “get their lick back on Drake.” “If I’m married, and my wife is going to join trolling her ex, go back to his ass,” Smith said, doubling down on his position.Clark humbled Smith, promising him a ""kept man"" if he dated Williams, possibly referring to their net worth. But, Alexis Ohanian, husband of Williams, praised the halftime show on Twitter, comparing it to her 2012 backlash after performing the Crip Walk at Wimbledon. “Some of y’all have no idea how criticized Serena was for this same dance at Wimbledon 13 years ago and it shows.... This is bigger than the music,” he wrote.Also Read: The NFL reportedly issued an apology to Lil Wayne for choosing Kendrick Lamar for the halftime show Apart from all the criticism, Roc Nation, Apple Music, and the NFL announced that Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show has become the most-watched halftime show performance of all time.","Serena Williams performed alongside Kendrick Lamar during the Super Bowl halftime show for Drake's ""Not Like Us"" Williams' brief appearance on television on Sunday was a thrilling surprise, as it was the second-most exciting surprise of the night.
