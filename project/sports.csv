Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

An Indian man living in Sweden has gone viral after saying he is returning to Delhi because, despite Europe’s clean air and smooth systems, life in India is emotionally easier.Ankur Tyagi wrote on X on Monday that people often assume Europe means clean air, good roads and smooth systems, but the reality of building a life there is very different.His post came as a response to another user who said they understood why many people want to leave India, citing low talent density, high real estate prices, pollution, corruption and high taxes.""You do everything alone.

“Even a small incident, something as ordinary as a scolding, can push a child towards the wrong step.”

Delhi Student Suicide Case: Massive Protest Outside School After Note Alleges Harassment By Teachers

Medals of a Class 10 student, who allegedly died by suicide due to mental harassment (Photo credit: PTI)

Defining the boundary between scolding and humiliation

The shifting emotional world of students

Pressure, competition and the punishment loop

A fragile safety system

So what's the way forward



The words come from Suman Prakash, a teacher and a career counsellor with over twenty years of experience, but they echo through classrooms across the country.His warning lands heavily in a year where student suicides have reached their highest levels ever recorded in India. Government data shows that student suicides rose from just over eight thousand a decade ago to nearly fourteen thousand in 2023, an increase far steeper than population growth.Behind the numbers are classrooms shaped by competition, families weighed down by expectations and schools where discipline often blurs into public shame.The death of a Class 10 student in Delhi, who allegedly named teachers in a suicide note and had complained of humiliation, has now placed renewed scrutiny on whether certain disciplinary practices have become psychologically unsafe. Protests outside his school, questioning by police and testimonies from classmates have built a portrait of a child who struggled not with failure, but with fear.At the heart of the debate is a simple question:When does teaching a lesson stop being discipline and start becoming emotional injury?Teachers, psychologists and counsellors consistently draw a distinction between corrective reprimand and humiliation, although that distinction often collapses inside real classrooms.Scolding, in its intended form, is private and behaviour specific. It pinpoints an action, suggests correction and remains controlled in tone.Humiliation, on the other hand, is public, identity directed and often delivered with mockery, comparison or threat. It takes the shape of comments about character rather than conduct, such as “you will never succeed”, “look at others, learn from them” or “you are always the problem”.Humiliation traps a child in a social spotlight they cannot escape, and psychologists note that it activates the same pain pathways as physical harm. The difference between the two is not mere semantics, because children interpret them very differently. A behaviour based correction can motivate, but identity based shaming can rupture trust and trigger panic, especially when the student is already anxious about parental expectations or peer comparison.This is the environment in which punishment culture thrives. In schools where academic output determines reputation, in coaching centres where competitive ranks shape futures, and in homes where opportunity is tied to marks, punishment often becomes a normalised tool, even when its emotional cost is profound.Teachers with long experience describe students today as more vulnerable to harsh reprimand than those of two decades ago. Science teacher Biva Jha, who has taught for more than twenty five years, attributes this sensitivity to changes in childhood routines and family structures.She points to declining physical activity, heavy reliance on mobile phones and the increasing number of single child households. “Children today are physically and emotionally more sensitive. With less outdoor play and more exposure to social media, they become easily overwhelmed,” she explains. Many are unaccustomed to hearing the word no at home, which reduces their resilience when faced with criticism outside.Her view is echoed, though differently framed, by younger teachers entering the profession. Rashi Mungia, who has been teaching for a year, says even primary school children now “understand mental health, emotions and what feels right or wrong.” This awareness demands that teachers monitor not only what they say, but how they say it. “One negative remark can affect a child for years,” she says, calling for discipline that is “respectful and restorative, not punitive. ”She also acknowledges friction between generations of teachers. Some experienced staff see empathy driven methods as too lenient, while younger teachers believe the emotional climate of classrooms has fundamentally changed. “Balancing kindness with authority is the real challenge,” she says, “but hurting a child’s confidence cannot be part of discipline.”Despite differing methods, both experienced and newer teachers agree on one point: emotional thresholds have shifted.If schools set one kind of pressure, coaching centres set another. With competitive exams acting as gateways to careers, families often invest high hopes and high fees into after school coaching. This intensifies expectations, and teachers in such environments navigate far thinner margins between motivation and harm.For Suman Prakash, the problem begins earlier, in parental choices. Many parents, he says, place their children in schools that do not match their socio economic reality. “They think a top school will help them, but it creates pressure. Parents worry about fees, children worry about matching the lifestyle of their peers,” he says. The result is an unequal emotional burden before a child even reaches the blackboard.A second shift, he argues, comes from the collapse of social outlets. “Earlier, if a teacher scolded us, we met friends, talked, laughed, released the stress. Children today have no such outlet. Everything is on the phone, no games, no informal support,” he explains. Without a peer space to process embarrassment or fear, reprimands linger and intensify.He also highlights what he calls the “marks inflation bubble”. With schools awarding higher marks more frequently, students may develop a false sense of ability. “Someone with 50 per cent ability is scoring in the 80s. When reality hits, the fall is very hard,” he says. In this environment, even a routine scolding can feel like a personal crisis, especially for students conditioned to believe that high marks validate worth.Prakash recalls an incident from his institute where a girl skipped class but accidentally revealed this by leaving her lunchbox behind. When her mother rushed to the centre, he urged her not to confront the girl immediately. “Children panic easily, and confrontation at the wrong moment can push them into extreme decisions,” he says. The matter was resolved privately the next day, avoiding both escalation and humiliation.The anecdote shows how small missteps can become high stakes events when fear replaces communication.The Delhi student’s death has also exposed structural weaknesses in school safety systems. Classmates have said he approached a school counsellor about suicidal thoughts, but was allegedly dismissed as joking. Teachers named in his note have been questioned and internal inquiries are ongoing. These gaps are not unusual, because many Indian schools have only one counsellor for hundreds of students, inconsistent complaint mechanisms and limited training for teachers on trauma informed discipline.With rising academic pressure and limited mental health infrastructure, punishment often becomes the default response to underperformance or behavioural issues, rather than a carefully calibrated tool.This creates a cycle that students struggle to break. A reprimand leads to shame, shame leads to fear of parental reaction, fear leads to silence and silence leaves children without any safe avenue to report distress.Across interviews, three themes emerge as essential for reform.First, teachers emphasise that discipline must be tied to behaviour, not character. Scolding that aims to correct can be valuable, but reprimand that aims to embarrass is counterproductive and risky.Second, the emotional environment of students must be recognised as fundamentally different from earlier decades. With higher expectations, sharper competition and reduced social outlets, children today process criticism with heightened sensitivity.Third, schools and families must rebuild channels of trust. The absence of safe spaces for children to express fear or failure allows humiliation, whether intended or not, to become destructive.As student suicides continue to rise, the cost of inaction becomes clearer. Punishment culture is not simply about tough love or maintaining discipline, it carries psychological weight that many children are no longer equipped to manage.","The death of a Class 10 student in Delhi, who allegedly named teachers in a suicide note and had complained of humiliation, has now placed renewed scrutiny on whether certain disciplinary practices have become psychologically unsafe.

A look at Chloe Kim’s life, accomplishments, and the relationship dynamic with Myles Garrett

For months, NFL fans and Olympic followers speculated whether Myles Garrett had finally found someone who could match his competitive fire and now the answer is very clear. The Cleveland Browns superstar and two-time Olympic gold medalist Chloe Kim have gone public, sealing their relationship with a sweet kiss caught on video during the Browns’ Nov. 25 game.But beyond the affectionate moment and the cameras, fans really want to know: who exactly is Chloe Kim, the woman capturing the heart of one of the NFL’s most dominant defensive players? Far from being just a supportive girlfriend in the stands, Chloe is a global sports powerhouse with her own legacy, molded by talent, cultural impact, and a fiercely authentic personality.Chloe Kim isn’t simply “the athlete dating an NFL player”, she’s one of the most celebrated female Olympians of her generation. A Southern California native, Chloe became the youngest woman to ever win Olympic halfpipe gold at just 17, and later added a second gold medal to her name, cementing herself as a snowboarding legend. Her grounded personality, humility, and witty online presence, like her playful “rawr XD. ” Instagram caption, have made her beloved among Gen Z fans.What's particularly compelling about the Chloe–Myles pairing is that both are elite athletes in completely different worlds.Myles just broke his single-season sack record, and Chloe is currently preparing to compete in the 2026 Winter Olympics. Instead of existing in competitive tension, their careers seem to complement one another.Chloe has spoken about how gaming helps her reconnect with her inner child and keep stress in check, noting, “I think having a love for gaming is everything to me…” and adding, “even my boyfriend, he’s so good at video games.” That playful intimacy combined with mutual respect is exactly why the relationship resonates with fans.It’s rare to see two high-profile athletes at the peak of their careers so genuinely supportive of each other, publicly yet authentically. As Chloe heads toward Italy for Olympic competition and Myles continues his pursuit of NFL greatness, this relationship feels rooted not in spotlight, not in hype, but in admiration and shared joy.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers’ secret marriage mystery grows louder as even family admits they’ve never met his wife","Cleveland Browns star Myles Garrett and Olympic snowboarding champion Chloe Kim have confirmed their relationship.

Nicolas Pepe and Teanna Trump’s romance and rumored engagement

Nicolas Pepe is making headlines off the pitch just as much as he does on it. The Villarreal winger is reportedly planning to take a big step in his personal life: marrying Teanna Trump AKA Keanna Nichele Jones, a former American adult film star and social media personality. Fans have followed the couple’s romance for over a year, and now social media is buzzing with rumors of an engagement, making this one of the most talked-about stories in football circles and online communities right now.The two went public with their relationship shortly before New Year’s Eve last year, after dating since Pépé joined Villarreal in August 2024. Over the past 18 months, they have shared glimpses of their life together online, with Trump often attending matches and celebrating his big wins, cheering for him. Now, reports suggest the couple could be heading toward an engagement, sparking excitement among fans.Teanna Trump began working in adult entertainment at 18. In 2020, she reportedly moved away from adult films and focused on subscription-based platforms like OnlyFans. In a Snapchat post back of her doing laundry back in May, Trump had written, ""Crazy how I switched jobs so quick. I was a po*nstar, now I'm a maid.""Teanna Trump's relationship with Nicolas Pepe reportedly started in late 2024, when she was spotted in the VIP section at Villarreal’s stadium during a match against Atletico Madrid. Trump has been a constant supporter at Villarreal games. She was also seen celebrating with Pepe after he earned the ‘Player of the Match’ award in Villarreal’s 2-2 Champions League draw against Juventus in October. Since then, they’ve been seen going out together and spending time with Pepes children from his previous marriage to Fanny B, according to a report in Marca.According to initial reports, Pepe is “extremely serious” about a long-term future with Trump. Rumors also say he encouraged her to leave the adult industry. However, neither Pepe, Trump, their representatives, nor Villarreal CF have confirmed the news, but their public appearances and social media posts have drawn a lot of attention already.The romance has taken center stage amid Pepe's football journey. After struggling at Arsenal, he had a short spell at Trabzonspor before signing with Villarreal last year. While he has scored two goals and provided two assists this season, it’s his off-field life and high-profile relationship that have dominated headlines.As of now, fans are eagerly waiting to see if an official announcement will confirm what has been widely rumored for months.","Nicolas Pepe and Teanna Trump have been dating for over a year.

Connor McDavid defends Oilers goaltending



The Edmonton Oilers were left stunned after being ripped apart 8 to 3 by the Dallas Stars, and the defeat revealed a level of defensive chaos that Edmonton cannot ignore. The loss was not just another bad night. It was a major warning siren. Every breakdown was on display, from lazy zone exits to blown assignments, and it showed a team that still has not learned from repeated failures this season. What made the aftermath even more compelling was how Connor McDavid chose to respond, not with blame, but with accountability.He stood in front of the cameras and refused to allow anyone to point the finger at the easiest target. The goaltenders were exposed, often abandoned, and McDavid reminded everyone that a goalie cannot save a game when the team offers no support. He has seen enough seasons and enough collapses to recognize where the issues truly lie.McDavid spoke directly to the topic of blame swirling around the goalie room. He said, ""I really feel like goaltending is a team thing. It's tough for goalies to look good when the group in front of them is not playing well."" It was a short statement, but it cut to the core. Odd man rushes, lost puck battles, and unchecked forwards crashing the crease will bury any goalie.On Tuesday, both Stuart Skinner and Calvin Pickard were left exposed, stranded without support or structure.McDavid doubled down when he added, ""I don't really care who it is; when the team in front of them is not playing up to their standards, it's tough for a goalie to look good. I felt bad for both of them tonight."" That is leadership in its purest form. Instead of throwing his goaltenders under the bus, he pulled them back inside and placed the responsibility where it belonged: on the entire roster.This is not a one time issue. Edmonton has now allowed seven or more goals in a game for the third time this season. Each time, the result has been inevitable. Calls are growing louder for a major move in net, but McDavid redirected the narrative. It is not just about swapping out a goalie. It is about fixing the system in front of him.The Oilers are in a season that feels like a loop of the same lessons. They have the talent to dominate, but talent without commitment is wasted. If they want to make a real push, they must protect their net, play with urgency in the defensive zone, and help the man in the crease instead of leaving him alone to drown.Also Read: Two-time Stanley Cup champion urges Auston Matthews to carry the Maple Leafs through turbulent Eastern Conference storm",Edmonton Oilers lost 8 to 3 to the Dallas Stars on Tuesday night.

How Auston Matthews’ return could impact Toronto Maple Leafs’ season



At last, the Toronto Maple Leafs are receiving a bit of good news. Forward Auston Matthews has announced that he will play when the team meets the Columbus Blue Jackets on Wednesday night. Matthews has been out for almost two weeks because of a lower-body injury sustained during a match with the Boston Bruins on November 11, after being hit hard by Bruins defenseman Nikita Zadorov. The captain's absence has been particularly hard on the team, as Toronto's record in his five-game absence is 1-2-2, including a tough 5-2 loss to the Montreal Canadiens last Saturday.Besides, Matthews also came back to the ice along with other prominent players. Forwards Matthew Knies and Nicolas Roy are going to get back on the team after each of them has been on the sidelines for three games due to lower-body injuries. The presence of these players is believed to energize the Leafs, who are battling through a hard start to the 2025-26 season. At present, Toronto is in the unfortunate position of being the only Eastern Conference team with a record below .500, and thus at the bottom of the East.The return of Matthews is their hope to regain their momentum and to find the spark that would take them up the standings.At just 28 years old, Matthews is already one of the most reliable players on the Toronto team. He scored nine times and assisted five times, totaling 14 points in 17 games this season, which made him the third-best goal-scorer and sixth-best point-getter on the team. His reappearance, along with Knies and Roy, could mean a reshuffling of the top line, possibly with Matthews on one side and Knies on the other, along with either Calle Jarnkrok or Nicholas Robertson. The scoring potential is definitely increased with Matthews on the ice; moreover, he is a source of guidance and firmness for a unit that has been plagued by injuries. In the past, the durability of Matthews has been an issue, as he played 81 games only once in his 69-goal 2023-24 season and 75 games only during his rookie season in 2016-17.The Leafs may be able to reverse their season’s direction with the trio of Matthews, Knies, and Roy in their line-up. While this star group is assumed to be the reason why the team slowly advances in the Eastern Conference standings, the audience can already see a new and strong team taking the ice for their entertainment.Aiso Read: Vancouver Canucks considering trades as Montreal Canadiens show interest in Ryan O’Reilly","Auston Matthews has announced that he will play when the team meets the Columbus Blue Jackets on Wednesday night.

Candace Owens claims Charlie Kirk sent a very scary text message the day before he died. She says Charlie Kirk told a Turning Point USA worker, “They are going to kill me.” She said this message was sent just one day before he was shot on September 10 at an event in Utah. Candace Owens spoke about this on the Myron Gaines podcast, where she made many strong claims about what she thinks happened.She said she does not like the silence from people inside Turning Point USA and believes someone is hiding something. Owens also said Charlie Kirk’s views were changing right before his death and that things around him felt tense. She says he told Tucker Carlson to “go max,” and she believes many people around him were upset about it. Her statements have now created a big debate online.On the podcast, Myron Gaines asked Candace Owens who she thought was “most responsible” for what happened to Charlie Kirk. She said his death did not feel simple and that she believed something bigger was happening. Owens said that one Turning Point USA staff member has the text message from Charlie Kirk where he wrote, “They are going to kill me.”She said this message was not about the trans lobby. She did not name the person who received the text.She said she did not understand why the TPUSA staff member never shared the warning with the public.Candace Owens also said she did not like how Turning Point USA was acting after Charlie Kirk’s death. She said it felt strange and did not match how close people said they were to Kirk. She said Charlie Kirk knew he would die young and believed she would be the one to speak up for him.Owens then said she believes Charlie Kirk’s killing was a “military hit.” She said she does not know who ordered it but feels sure it looked like a planned attack. She also said she sees what she calls “faith infiltration” inside Turning Point USA. She believes some people got close to Charlie Kirk on purpose.Candace Owens also claimed that an Egyptian military plane was sitting at an airport near the event on the day Charlie Kirk was shot. She said the plane did not move and was “known to” Turning Point USA. She suggested this looked unusual.Also Read: Candace Owens raises heat while claiming Erika Kirk is on autopilot and holds no verifiable lies after Charlie Kirk was killed","Candace Owens claims Charlie Kirk sent a very scary text message the day before he died.

JD Vance's Hindu Wife Usha To Convert After Vice President's Pitch? US Expert’s Big Reveal

An emotional interview, a brief hug and a missing ring





Joy Reid, an American political commentator and television host has suggested that JD Vance could leave his wife, linking her claim to an online rumour wave that has followed the vice president, his wife Usha Vance and conservative commentator Erika Kirk for weeks.Reid made the remarks on the I’ve Had It podcast, arguing that some MAGA supporters would not accept Usha Vance, who is Indian American, as a future first lady.Reid said, “They can’t have the successor to MAGA be the guy with the Brown Hindu wife. That’s why he’s throwing his wife under the bus. Poor Usha. Or she’s in on it,” she said.""You not doing that right thing. You're supposed to be a widow, you in leather pants? That's not widow wear,"" she added.She then referred to Erika Kirk’s moment with Vance, echoing online commentary. “Holding on the back of his head and rubbing on his head,” Reid said, adding that she would be suspicious if any woman held her husband like that.Reid later framed it as political strategy: “Wouldn’t it be the most perfect fairy tale, MAGA fairy tale, if he finally sees the light that he needs a White queen instead of this Brown Hindu?”The rumours began on 22 November 2025, when Erika Kirk spoke to Megyn Kelly in Glendale, Arizona.Kirk discussed her grief after Charlie Kirk’s murder and said she had prayed she might have been pregnant on the day he died.Within hours, her words were torn from that context and repackaged as a “confession,” with social media claiming she was signalling something new.Almost a month earlier, on 29 October 2025, Erika had introduced JD Vance at a Turning Point event in Mississippi. The two exchanged a brief hug on stage.Once the pregnancy speculation took off, that hug was replayed and slowed down as if it contained hidden meaning.A third moment fed the rumours on 19 November 2025, when Usha Vance attended an event without her wedding ring, which the internet quickly framed as a sign of marital strain between her and the vice president.","Joy Reid, an American political commentator and television host has suggested that JD Vance could leave his wife.

“I need to make these people pay me for wasting my time.”

If you thought the Cardi B and Offset saga couldn’t get any messier, the internet just handed us a freshly brewed pot of drama. A popular gossip page has now stepped into the crossfire and not with speculation, but with receipts claiming that Offset’s alleged blogger friend has been sliding into their DMs all summer trying to plant tea about Cardi. And according to the blog? The tea wasn’t just cold… it was straight-up false. The situation has fans whispering about a bigger pattern of “narrative planting” behind the scenes, and suddenly the storyline feels way deeper.The drama erupted after @sweetteatheblog posted a message accusing Offset of “sending his blogger” to feed them questionable information about Cardi B. The blog names a woman — Alexis, also known as Siana who they say has been in their DMs “all summer” offering alleged insider tea.But according to the post, everything flipped when the page accidentally revealed her name in an earlier story. That’s when the blogger allegedly got angry and the blog realized something was off. The page makes it clear they’re not here for unverified gossip, especially when it involves someone they explicitly said they “like” Cardi B.The most shocking part of the post is the blog’s admission that the last piece of tea Alexis allegedly delivered turned out to be false.The blog even issued a public apology to Cardi and her team for the misinformation.In their words:And then the punchline:This single sentence sent fans spinning, especially those who already believed Offset might be behind certain narratives circulating online.For months, fans have speculated that Offset has been connected to certain gossip pages and content creators who consistently push unflattering narratives about Cardi B with Stefon Diggs. While none of this has been verified, the internet loves a pattern, and this new blog claim only fueled those suspicions.Users on X began stitching together alleged timelines, pointing out how certain stories conveniently aligned with Offset’s side of the drama. Some even revisited Cardi’s own livestream earlier this year where she accused Offset of using “blogger friends” to stir mess around her name.This new receipt acted like gasoline on an already-lit fire.The breakup between Cardi B and Offset has already played out publicly, with leaked texts, explosive accusations, and messy social posts.

Taylor Swift Reveals Favorite Track, Talks Travis Kelce And New Album “The Life Of A Showgirl”

A meaningful night that blended old friendships, new family connections, and growing anticipation

Just hours after the Chiefs’ overtime win against the Colts, Travis Kelce hosted a private, intimate dinner at his brand-new 1587 Prime Steakhouse. This wasn’t a typical victory meal, as it brought together his fiancée Taylor Swift, Kelce’s family, and longtime friends in a setting that felt much closer to a symbolic “rehearsal” dinner than a casual night out.With Uncle Don helping arrange the reservation and Swift jokingly calling his college crew the “Purdudes,” the event sent fans buzzing about just how intertwined the two families have become. Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have become accustomed to making headlines, but their latest post-game gathering in Kansas City fired up a different kind of conversation, which was one centered on love, legacy, and what increasingly feels like early wedding momentum.Travis Kelce’s newly opened restaurant provided the perfect backdrop for a gathering that stretched across generations. Uncle Don arrived with his decades-old Purdue University circle, the very men Swift was spotted hugging and high-fiving throughout the weekend, while Scott Swift joined on behalf of Taylor’s side, subtly signaling just how seamlessly the families now interact. Guests described the evening as warm, lively, and deeply nostalgic, especially for Don’s friends who turned the Chiefs weekend into a reunion of their own.One attendee’s daughter, Meredith Holzmeister, shared a group photo and a heartfelt reflection about how much the weekend meant to her father. She wrote, “My Dad said it was 'one of the greatest weekends of my entire life!!!’” highlighting the blend of football excitement, time with Donna Kelce, and the unforgettable stadium experience.She added that the Arrowhead tour, time with “Mama Kelce,” and celebrating the nail-biter win with the Swifts created a sense of revived youthful joy for the men who first became friends in the 1970s. Her message also offered a wink to Swift fans who spent days wondering about the older men Taylor embraced during the game: “And now the mystery is solved for all the Swifties as to who the 'old guys' are…”What was meant to be a simple post-game dinner evolved into something far more symbolic—a night where two worlds blended effortlessly, deepening the impression that Swift and Kelce are moving with intention toward their future together.Also read: Travis Kelce flashes luxury $500,00 Rolex ahead of Chiefs' huge victory over Indianapolis Colts","Travis Kelce hosted a private, intimate dinner at his brand-new 1587 Prime Steakhouse.

During an interview with Sherri Sheperd, Gabrielle reflected on Dwyane Wade’s cancer journey. While talking about how she could not process the news, she said,“Initially, not well at all. I think because when you hear ‘cancer,’ you hear the diagnosis. Even though I have so many friends who are cancer survivors, you think of the worst-case scenario. I just think of, I just thought he was going to be ripped out of my life, ripped out of our children's lives, and, you know, no one really knows how or what you're going to do until it's there, and neither of us handled it very well at all. We talk about how year nine in our marriage was so hard, especially since, you know, he wasn't divulging his cancer diagnosis at the time.”While reflecting on the problems that came around during one of the most difficult time in her life, Gabrielle Union further mentioned,“So you come up with all sorts of scenarios but let me tell you baby money issues moving illness when they say better for worse for sickness and in health, it will literally bring you to the altar.”Dwyane Wade is currently cancer-free and strongly believes in being grateful every day.

What to Expect From Tonight's Houston Rockets vs Golden State Warriors Game (November 26, 2025)

for the Golden State Warriors as they prepare for a high-stakes NBA Cup matchup against the Houston Rockets on November 27, 2025. With both teams battling injuries and jockeying for competitive positioning, Curry’s availability immediately becomes one of the biggest storylines heading into the night. His comeback not only boosts the Warriors’ offense but also restores confidence in a roster that has been stretched thin by absences.This game carries added importance because Golden State has struggled to maintain consistency in the Western Conference with multiple rotational players sidelined. The Golden State Warriors have been relying heavily on role players and secondary scoring options in recent weeks, but Stephen Curry’s return promises to shift the team back toward a more familiar offensive rhythm. His elite shooting, off-ball movement, and leadership offer the Warriors a clear advantage as they face a young, energetic Rockets squad.after recovering from a Grade 1 left hamstring strain that caused him to miss several games.Following a careful and closely monitored rehabilitation plan, the Golden State Warriors’ medical staff cleared him for full participation only after he completed multiple full-speed practice sessions without setbacks.

Golden State has been without Al Horford due to sciatica, Jonathan Kuminga because of a knee injury, and De’Anthony Melton, who remains out with an ACL issue. Draymond Green is listed as probable, leaving Curry’s presence even more vital as the team works to stabilize its rotation.Curry’s presence elevates Golden State immediately, restoring their offensive identity with elite spacing, shot creation, and game-changing momentum. His ability to stretch defenses opens opportunities for teammates like Jimmy Butler and Buddy Hield, both of whom have stepped up as the Warriors navigated recent injuries.

Rohit Sharma opens up on 2026 T20 World Cup, wants India to play FINAL

GUWAHATI: India’s 0-2 series capitulation to South Africa can be best described in one word: ‘Humiliating’. After South Africa coach Shukri Conrad said on Tuesday that they wanted to make India ‘grovel’, one expected the Indian batters to show more fight and prepare an answer.But all they could come up with over their three-and-a-half hour surrender on the fifth day in Barsapara was another exhibition of ineptitude on a pitch that had something in it for the spinners.India’s 408-run loss is the biggest in terms of runs that India have suffered in their 94 year history as a Test nation. They have now lost five of their last seven Tests at home — a record that Gautam Gambhir ’s boys will not be proud of.The coach, though, offered a reminder that this was a team in transition. “You should not bring the three-Test loss against New Zealand last year into this conversation. That was a completely different team and this is a side which has a number of boys who are still learning the ropes. That’s not an excuse but it doesn’t always happen that the batting and bowling unit of a team go through transition at the same time,” Gambhir said.It was a feeble defence of his team to a query on why the Indian batters have looked like sitting ducks against spin at home over the last one year.Against New Zealand it was Mitchell Santner, here it was offie Simon Harmer who ran through the Indian middle order to finish with 6/37. In a two-Test series, the off-spinner finished with 17 Test wickets, an indication of the dominance he has enjoyed against the Indian batters.Take the first session of Day Five, for example. After nightwatchman Kuldeep Yadav was bowled by a delivery that kept slightly low, Dhruv Jurel and Rishabh Pant, two shining lights of ‘New India’, jabbed at the turning ball off Harmer with hard hands and presented simple catches to Aiden Markram at first slip. The South African opener finished with nine catches in the game, another world record for a non-wicketkeeper in Tests.Wickets tumbled but the biggest disappointment of the entire morning was Sai Sudharsan. He was dropped twice and was caught off a no-ball once during the course of his 139-ball stay, which yielded 14 runs. Trying to play spinners off the back-foot with both his legs virtually joined together, the southpaw doesn’t give himself any room to manoeuvre his body to play on both sides of the wicket. The T20 overdrive has taught him to play with hard hands and go back on the back foot to spinners compulsively. That works on IPL featherbeds, but come a Day Five turner in India, he is as poor technically as most of his other colleagues, seniors and contemporaries.Every ball that Sai faced was an exposition of his poor technique and just after lunch, all left-arm spinner Senuran Muthusamy had to do was pitch one slightly fuller into the rough. Sai nicked it and Markram completed the catch at first slip.The next three — allrounders Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar and Nitish Reddy, who were chosen ahead of specialists — fell to the guile of Harmer and Maharaj in no time. And when Marco Jansen, running back from mid-off, completed a stunning catch to dismiss Mohammed Siraj, South Africa celebrated as if there was no tomorrow.It was victory in India for them after 25 years and the entire team ran across the ground to congratulate Jansen, the hero of the game with a match winning 93 and a 6/48 in the first innings. “This victory is up there with our World Test Championship win,” SA skip per Temba Bavuma said.""You can’t have so many allrounders, so much chopping and changing. India need to sit down and think. You can’t forget these results. You need to have discussions around how you see Indian Test cricket going forward. Some stalwarts have retired over the last 6-8 months. When that happens you need to have a vision.” - Anil Kumble, ex-India captain.",India’s 408-run loss is the biggest in terms of runs that India have suffered in their 94 year history as a Test nation.

There has been a lot of talk about the kind of wicket the head coach wants for home Tests. But what is BCCI’s view regarding a proper Test wicket?

Despite all the success in limited overs, now in a span of 13 months, the Indian men’s team suffered two whitewashes in Tests at home. What is plaguing us in red-ball cricket?

Is BCCI going to take some decisions after this debacle at home to South Africa?

These days Indians are greatly troubled by the foreign spinners on tracks where our spinners are looking ineffective. What needs to be done?

Your thoughts on BCCI coming up with new Test venues while many players and experts feel Test cricket should be played in traditional centres only...

But for the T20 World Cup, we have only five venues in the country...

Congratulations on bringing Test cricket to Guwahati. But after five days’ play, what are your thoughts on the match?

What are BCCI’s plans to boost the growth of women’s cricket further?

GUWAHATI: As India suffered a humiliating whitewash to South Africa in Guwahati, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Devajit Saikia told TOI in an exclusive interview that there needs to be soul-searching regarding Indian batters’ inability to play spin at home. Saikia also said that a five-day wicket is ideal for Test cricket and players must adapt to different conditions at different venues.I am not privy to the developments in CAB and Eden Gardens. But whatever is done in Barsapara is according to BCCI chief curator Asish Bhowmick, who oversaw the ground as well as the wickets. I think the curating team deserves full credit for presenting such a wonderful wicket. I have heard experts saying this is a perfect wicket for Test cricket.The players must adjust to the weather, the overall conditions, and the composition of the soil as well as the length of the grass on a pitch. A Test cricketer is expected to adapt to any kind of wicket. If you look at the batting of Dilip Vengsarkar or Sunil Gavaskar in the past, they used different techniques for playing at home or in different conditions in countries like the West Indies, England, South Africa, or Australia.Everything is variable except the player, and he or she should adapt to the conditions. That is what the game is all about. That is the beauty of Test cricket.You have to consider vital things. One is that three seasoned cricketers — Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Ravichandran Ashwin — left Test cricket. New players are coming into the set-up. So, at present, the Indian team is going through a transition. It will take some time before we reclaim our position as the No. 1 Test team in the world.BCCI doesn’t take knee-jerk reactions. We are going on as per our long-term plan. Winning or losing is a part of the game. We don’t make changes every now and then. If any change is required, we take a call at the end of that particular period.We have to certainly do some soul-searching, and there will be some discussion on this. We will definitely visit this aspect, whether our best batters are less comfortable playing spin nowadays. A lot of touring spinners have been very successful here. Be it in the case of the New Zealand series last year (Oct-Nov 2024, India lost 0-3) or now the South Africa series, their spinners are doing the job very nicely. But what is troubling is that our best batters are unable to cope with that. We have our expert teams, cricket committees, and in the discussions, we’ll definitely highlight this aspect.India is a vast country compared to England or Australia. If you look at the Indian cricket ecosystem about 20 years ago, before MS Dhoni’s era, all the players for the national team were coming from basically the metropolitan cities. And once Dhoni broke that shackle and became the captain for a long period of time, players started coming from small cities. We want diversification. We do not want to centralise all the cricketing activities to four or five cities. So that is why we are spreading the game.Yes, we are restricting it to five big centres with legacy and history because ICC wants us to have only five venues due to logistical issues. Had it been 15, then we could have added maybe Guwahati or Ranchi or Indore or Mohali or Dharamshala or any other venues. When we have the scope of expanding, we can have more venues, like the 2023 World Cup. We had 10 venues, including Kochi and Guwahati for practice games.It is a big thing for the northeast to have Guwahati as a Test venue. Once you have the Test venue, it means your overall infrastructure and overall cricketing culture is complete. And I am very thankful to BCCI, although I am a part of it, as well as to ICC for allowing this part of the country to have a Test venue. Special thanks to ICC chair Jay Shah for his support and unwavering guidance to develop cricket in the entire northeast.We are going to enhance the contract value of our centrally contracted women cricketers. We are in discussion about having more tournaments in the multi-day format in the upcoming seasons, and our team will play more bilateral matches in the longer format.",BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia says there needs to be soul-searching regarding Indian batters’ inability to play spin at home. He also said that a five-day wicket is ideal for Test cricket and players must adapt to different conditions at different venues. The Indian team is going through a transition.

Alexandra Litvinova reveals the ‘biggest secret’ she kept for nine months



Alexis Sánchez’s career shift aligns with major life changes



Alexis Sánchez’s partner, Alexandra Litvinova, has revealed a major personal moment she kept hidden for months. The model confirmed she is expecting a baby after choosing to stay out of the spotlight throughout her pregnancy. The announcement surprised fans, especially since the couple avoided addressing rumors and stayed silent on social media.Litvinova said the decision to keep the news private came with emotional pressure. She stayed offline, limited her social circle, and stepped back from public life while Sánchez continued his first season with Sevilla. The couple recently moved to Spain after the Chilean forward signed a one-year deal with the La Liga club.Alexandra Litvinova shared the news through a video filmed in her garden, where she showed her baby bump for the first time. She admitted the past months took a toll, describing the struggle to balance privacy and excitement. “Keeping it hidden for nine months was really hard. No social media, no friends, no life outside the house,” she said. She added that “pregnancy is something you want to share with the whole world and keep to yourself at the same time.The reveal sparked immediate speculation among followers because Litvinova appeared less pregnant in the clip. Some fans joked that the baby might already be born, pointing out that the video seemed filmed during warmer months. Alexandra had even dropped a hint days earlier with a photo of her and Sánchez captioned “1+1=3,” but the couple waited until now to confirm anything.Sánchez’s personal news arrives during a busy stretch in his career. The 36-year-old returned to La Liga in September, joining Sevilla as part of a revamped project under coach Matías Almeyda.Despite his age, Sánchez remains a key contributor, adding experience and leadership to the squad. He has already recorded a goal and an assist, marking a solid start to his latest European chapter.His return has also brought him back into contact with FC Barcelona, where he previously spent three seasons and created some of his most memorable moments. From his iconic chip against Real Madrid in 2013 to six major trophies won with the club, Sánchez’s earlier spell in Spain left a lasting mark. Now he faces Barça again in league action, this time as a veteran anchoring Sevilla’s attack.Also Read: Snooker legend Ronnie O'Sullivan makes candid revelation about substance abuse after watching Charlie Sheen’s Netflix documentary",Alexandra Litvinova has revealed she is expecting a baby with Alexis Sánchez.

Gautam Gambhir fiery press conference: On whitewash, Rishabh Pant shot, pitch and more

Here's how India can get to 130 points from remaining nine Tests:

Six wins + two draws = 80 points

Seven wins = 84 points

NEW DELHI: India’s hopes of reaching a third World Test Championship (WTC) final, after missing out in the last cycle, have taken a major hit after a stunning 2-0 home series defeat to South Africa. The whitewash — India’s second at home in two years — has left Shubman Gill ’s side stranded in fifth place on the WTC table at 48.15%, exactly halfway through their 2025–27 campaign. With nine of their 18 Tests completed, the equation is now stark: India must be near-perfect from here if they want to make the top two.While the standings are still fluid — New Zealand haven’t played a series yet, Sri Lanka and Pakistan have played only one each, and England have just begun their second assignment — the early dominance of Australia (100%) and South Africa (75%) has pushed India into a corner. The benchmarks from previous cycles suggest that teams typically need 60–65% to qualify. India reached the 2023 final with 58.8%, while Australia finished second in the previous cycle with 67.54%.At the halfway mark, India sit on 52 points (four wins, four loss, one draw). To reach the 60% mark in the cycle — 130 points out of a possible 216 — they need 78 more points from their remaining nine Tests. Under the current points system (12 per win, 4 per draw), the math is unforgiving.Anything less, and they will need other teams to stumble badly.The second half of India’s campaign begins with away tours of Sri Lanka (August 2026) and New Zealand (Oct-Nov 2026). India traditionally dominated Sri Lanka — five wins in their last six Tests there — but New Zealand remained a formidable challenge, with India losing 2-0 in 2020 and 1-0 in 2014. Even a 4-0 return from these tours may still leave India needing big results in their final — and toughest — assignment: five home Tests against Australia in early 2027.Australia look favourites to seal an early spot in the final after winning all four Tests so far and hosting Bangladesh and New Zealand later in the cycle. South Africa, with three wins from four away games, also have a strong platform despite challenging home series ahead.India’s early stumbles at home mean their margin for error has vanished. Their road to the WTC final is still open — just narrower than ever.","India's hopes of reaching a third World Test Championship (WTC) final have taken a major hit after a stunning 2-0 home series defeat to South Africa. The whitewash has left Shubman Gill’s side stranded in fifth place on the WTC table at 48.15%, exactly halfway through their 2025–27 campaign. With nine of their 18 Tests completed, the equation is now stark: India must be near-perfect from here if they want to make the top two.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125604300,imgsize-62052,width-400,resizemode-4/team-india.jpg"

EU Divided Ahead Of COP30 In Brazil; Chaos Over Climate Targets; Green Dream Falters?





Swedish activist Greta Thunberg was banned from Venice for two days and was asked to pay a fine of £131 after she and her team painted the Grand Canal green by pouring green dye, which they claimed was not harmful. Greta and Extinction Rebellion activists were reacting to Italy’s opposition to including fossil fuel restrictions in a deal agreed to at the United Nations climate summit on Friday in Brazil.Apart from Greta, the 35 activists, mostly from Ital,y were also banned and penalised.The protesters claimed that the colouring agent posed no environmental threat and was intended to symbolise what they described as the ""massive effects of climate collapse"".“I am even more surprised to see Greta Thunberg among the authors of this useless protest, who clearly aim - more than raising awareness about the environment - to give visibility to themselves,” Veneto governor Luca Zaia said.Extinction Rebellion activists also targeted rivers, canals and fountains in Milan, Genoa, Bologna, Padua, Palermo, Parma, Trieste, Turin and Taranto, to raise awareness about the “massive effects of climate collapse”.Venice's canals are UNESCO World Heritage site and the administration called Thunberg's act as ""disrespectful"" to the heritage of the city, its history.The COP30 summit in Brazil, in which the US is not participating, boosted funding for poor nations to adapt to a warming climate but mostly steered clear from mentioning the role fossil fuels play in increasing global temperatures.

Gambhir crisis: India suffer worst-ever Test loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-south-africa/gambhir-crisis-india-suffer-worst-ever-test-loss/articleshow/125603918.cms,"Gautam Gambhir after Test defeat. (Image: ANI)

Gautam Gambhir fiery press conference: On whitewash, Rishabh Pant shot, pitch and more

GUWAHATI: After South Africa coach Shukri Conrad said on Tuesday that they wanted to make India ‘grovel’, one expected the Indian batters to put up a fight. But all they could come up with was another exhibition of ineptitude on a pitch that had something in it for spinners. The 408-run loss is the biggest in terms of runs suffered by India in its 94-year history as a Test nation. At the press interaction, Gambhir was asked point blank whether he would quit as India’s red-ball coach. “I said in my first press conference and I say it again, I’m not important, Indian cricket is. It is up to the BCCI to decide,” retorted Gambhir.The biggest loss for India in Test cricket in terms of runs is an ignominy that head coach Gautam Gambhir will have to live with. As India were hurtling to a 408-run defeat to South Africa at the Assam Cricket Association ground here in Barsapara, sections of the crowd started chanting, “Go back, Gambhir”.At the press interaction that followed the resounding loss, India’s biggest in terms of runs, Gambhir was asked point blank whether he would quit as India’s red-ball coach after the debacle.“I said that in my first press-conference and I say that again, I’m not important, Indian cricket is. It is up to the BCCI to decide,” Gambhir said in his combative way. Under Gambhir, India have now lost eight Tests in one year, with the only bright spot being a 2-2 draw against England away from home.Gambhir reminded his detractors about that performance, as well as the Champions Trophy triumph and Asia Cup victories that India have achieved in the limited-overs formats.“People remember what happened against New Zealand but have forgotten what happened after that. It’s the same team that fought so hard against England and won the Asia Cup and Champions Trophy,” Gambhir kept countering.India don’t play Test cricket now for a while, with their next assignment being a tour of Sri Lanka in August next year. In four days’ time, they go into a long white-ball leg which will culminate with the T20 World Cup in Feb-March in India. Any call on the coach’s future will likely only be taken after the T20 World Cup.Gambhir said that if India are to do well in Test cricket, they need to prioritise the format. “Red-ball success and white-ball success should not be mixed. And this is not an excuse, but it doesn’t help when the team is playing white-ball cricket in Australia five days before a Test series against a strong team like South Africa, which has quality spinners. Two days of practice before a series like this is not enough,” Gambhir said.The coach also stressed the need to brush things “under the carpet”. “The reality is, we still need to improve a lot in red ball cricket, be it mentally, technically or absorbing pressure. And most importantly, by not playing to the gallery,” he said.It seemed a jibe directed at stand-in captain Rishabh Pant, who was dismissed playing an extremely poor shot off Marco Jansen in the first innings, a dismissal that kickstarted India’s capitulation. The coach followed it up with another strong observation which may not be music to the ears of a maverick like Pant.“You don’t need the most skillful and flamboyant players to succeed in Test cricket. You need the toughest characters with limited skills who will go on to succeed in Test cricket irrespective of how the conditions are and what the situation is,” he said.As Gambhir delved deeper into the defeat, it seemed he was struggling to come to terms with it. “From 95/1 to 120/7 is not acceptable. And we keep talking about spin, but the one who got four wickets is a pacer. And we’ve had these collapses in the past as well. Someone needs to put their hand up and say that I’m going to stop this. It was this 30-minute spell that took the game away from us, till then we were in control,” the coach explained.Gambhir, though, asked for some patience, saying that his team is full of youngsters and that it is going through a transition process. “Four of five batters in this top-eight have played less than 15 Test matches and they will grow. They’re learning on the job and Test cricket is not easy.”It remains to be seen whether Gambhir’s boys prove the coach right when Test cricket returns in eight months’ time.","Gautam Gambhir was asked point blank whether he would quit as India’s red-ball coach. “I said in my first press conference and I say it again, I’m not important, Indian cricket is.

Ronnie O’Sullivan adjusts career plans as he limits UK appearances



Ronnie O’Sullivan has spent decades at the top of snooker, but even now, nearing 50, he’s still confronting the shadows of his past. The documentary he recently watched about Charlie Sheen forced him to revisit a version of himself he’s long tried to leave behind.The Rocket admitted that seeing Sheen’s decades-long spiral reminded him how close he came to losing everything during his own stretch of drink and drugs. His reflections arrive at a moment when he’s balancing personal clarity with the demands of a career still capable of producing brilliance.As O’Sullivan prepares for another run at major titles, his honesty about addiction and recovery also offers insight into the choices shaping his future. From limiting his time in the United Kingdom due to tax rules to managing heavy travel from his new base in Dubai, he’s trying to protect both his well-being and what remains of his competitive window. His revelations paint a portrait of a champion determined to stay grounded while still chasing history.Ronnie O’Sullivan didn’t expect a Netflix film to shake him, but Sheen’s story did exactly that. “I just watched the Charlie Sheen documentary and he went on for about 30 years.I got out earlier after three years. So I had a result!” he said, acknowledging how destructive those years were.He watched Sheen describe the highs, the spirals and the reckless pace, and the familiarity rattled him. “Charlie Sheen went for like 30 years. I’m thinking, wow man. He’s lucky to be alive. There are times where you feel like that could have been me.”Between ages 19 and 25, O’Sullivan cycled through what he calls the phases of addiction. “The first two or three years [of drinking] were great. We had a great time. But it gets to a point where it’s like fun, and then it’s fun with problems. Then it is just problems.”He admitted he wished he could reverse the decisions that left him vulnerable on and off the table. “I caused a lot of damage in those years to my game. Which caused a lot of damage to me off the table. I think I’ve become quite vulnerable, quite unconfident…”Fresh off hitting two 147s in a single match in Saudi Arabia, he said, “I’m still capable of winning tournaments. I’d love to win another World Championship.” As he returns to England for the UK Championship, that quest continues.While his competitive fire remains intact, O’Sullivan is reshaping his schedule to fit his life in Dubai. The move, driven by travel fatigue and a need for stability, also means meticulous planning to avoid tax penalties. He explained to SportsBoom, “I’ll try and come back if I can. There’s the flying involved, the expenses involved. It’s not a short flight. Maybe next season I might play a few more in the UK.”Confirming he will skip the Masters, he said, “I’d love to play the UK Championship and the Tour Championship if I can. Probably just be two tournaments this year in the UK before the World Championship. It’s hard with all the travel and all that. I’m not getting any younger, so I have to prioritize.” Even his dogs have embraced the Dubai lifestyle. “They go out there and chill in the sun. It’s fine for them, everything’s air conditioned so they’re comfortable,” he added.Also Read: Cristiano Ronaldo, Conor McGregor and other stars land on Jake Paul’s most overrated list ahead of Anthony Joshua fight",Ronnie O’Sullivan watched Charlie Sheen’s documentary about substance abuse.

Erika Kirk pregnant? Usha Vance's missing ring? Tracking the crazy rumours swirling in MAGA town,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/erika-kirk-pregnant-usha-vances-missing-ring-tracking-the-crazy-rumours-swirling-in-maga-town/articleshow/125565496.cms,"The internet spent the past week convinced it had uncovered a political soap opera, even though the only thing on display was grief, coincidence and a great deal of imagination. A widow spoke about the future she lost, a vice president offered a public hug and a mother stepped out without her wedding ring. These separate, ordinary moments were stitched together by the MAGAverse into a rumour that Erika Kirk was secretly pregnant and Usha Vance was quietly separating. None of it was true. All of it was loud. The real story was quieter and far more human.

The hug that turned into a storyline

Erika Kirk’s Remark About Pregnancy On Megyn Kelly Show Sparks Storm Around Charlie Kirk & JD Vance

A ringless moment becomes Exhibit Three

How separate lives became a shared rumour

What remains when the noise fades





There are weeks when the internet behaves like a restless crowd that cannot resist the temptation to turn private sorrow into public speculation. The latest rumour cyclone began on 22 November 2025 during Erika Kirk’s live conversation with Megyn Kelly in Glendale, Arizona. Erika spoke with the kind of openness that only grief makes possible. She described how, on the day Charlie Kirk was murdered, she had prayed she might have been pregnant. It was not an announcement and it was not meant to invite attention. It was a window into the shock and longing that accompany sudden loss. She was speaking about the future she and Charlie had imagined, and the wish that a part of him might still live on. Yet within hours, the internet detached her words from their emotional truth and recast them as a secret confession. What was said as a lament became interpreted as a clue.Almost a month earlier, on 29 October 2025, Erika had introduced Vice President JD Vance at a Turning Point event in Mississippi. The two shared a brief embrace on stage. It was a public gesture of solidarity during a period where condolences, political duty and emotional exhaustion had become unavoidable companions.It should have been forgotten after the livestream ended. Instead, long after the moment had passed, the hug returned as supporting material for the rumour mill. Viewers slowed down recordings and analysed the still frames like detectives searching for hidden motives. A simple gesture of support was treated as if it carried unspoken intention. Nothing in the image justified the reaction. The frenzy was built entirely from interpretation rather than action.The rumours escalated further when Usha Vance became entangled in the speculation. On 19 November 2025, she attended an event without her wedding ring. There was no announcement or comment from her. In ordinary life, people remove rings for reasons that range from washing hands to childcare to forgetfulness. None of these reasons usually require explanation. However, because the internet had already convinced itself that Erika was signalling something and that JD Vance’s hug had meaning, Usha’s bare finger was folded into the same imagined plot. A single photograph was treated as evidence of marital trouble, even though nothing publicly indicated such a thing. The absence of jewellery was transformed into symbolism purely because the moment happened to coincide with unrelated speculation.The poignancy of this episode lies in how easily distinct events were fused together into a single narrative. Erika Kirk was mourning the future she lost and trying to articulate the rawness of that grief. JD Vance was offering ordinary comfort in a public space. Usha Vance was photographed while going about her day. None of these moments were linked and none of them carried the weight that the internet assigned to them. The public, however, often prefers the convenience of narrative over the difficulty of reality. It is simpler to believe that everything is connected than to accept that people are living through their own struggles independently.The facts are straightforward. Erika Kirk has not announced a pregnancy. There is no credible suggestion that JD Vance’s hug signified anything beyond empathy. There is no confirmed sign that Usha Vance is separating from her husband. What actually happened was a widow expressing sorrow, a politician offering support and a mother briefly appearing without her wedding ring. Yet the rumour machine converted these ordinary moments into a storyline that never existed. When the frenzy inevitably moves on, the only people left to face the lingering distortions are those whose grief and privacy were turned into content.This is the tragic irony of the MAGAverse’s rumour cycles. They begin with imagination, escalate through repetition and end with the quiet realisation that nothing scandalous occurred. The real story was never about hidden pregnancies or strained marriages. It was about how quickly empathy is replaced by intrigue in a world that has grown too comfortable treating people as symbols instead of individuals.","The internet spent the past week convinced it had uncovered a political soap opera, even though the only thing on display was grief, coincidence and a great deal of imagination. Erika Kirk was mourning the future she lost and trying to articulate the rawness of that grief. JD Vance was offering ordinary comfort in a public space. Usha Vance was photographed while going about her day. None of these moments were linked and none of them carried the weight that the internet assigned to them.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125565496,imgsize-764934,width-400,resizemode-4/125565496.jpg"

'Not many willing to live surgeon's stressful life'





NEW DELHI: India's top-performing medical graduates have made their preference clear in this year's NEET-PG counselling - career stability is trumping the operating table.In the first round of NEET-PG 2025, medicine and radiology dominated choices among high-rankers while general surgery saw one of its steepest drops in recent years, reflecting growing concerns over stress, long training pathways and mounting medico-legal pressures.Among the first 1,500 candidates, 632 (42%) chose MD general medicine and 447 (30%) opted for MD radiodiagnosis. Only 99 students (6.6%) selected MS general surgery, indicating a widening shift away from high-risk procedural fields.A strong preference for Delhi emerged in this year's NEET-PG counselling , with six of the top 10 candidates choosing Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.Dr Neeraj Nischal from department of medicine at AIIMS said the consistent popularity of medicine is unsurprising. ""MD Medicine is the gateway to almost all superspecialities, so it has always been in high demand. Students feel diagnostics offers a more controlled work life, though that may not always be true. Decisions are often influenced by seniors.""The fall in interest for surgery, senior clinicians say, is rooted in deeper anxieties.""Surgical branches are very demanding - you need passion. Otherwise, burnout is inevitable,"" Dr Nischal said.Surgeons themselves acknowledge that the field has steadily lost appeal. ""This is not new,"" said Dr Piyush Ranjan from the AIIMS surgery department. ""A decade ago, surgery was seen as a very lucrative branch, but several factors have changed that. It takes much longer to settle down because general surgery is only the first step - you usually need to super-specialise in neurosurgery, cardiac surgery, urology or paediatric surgery. ""He said the risks make many hesitate. ""There is a thin line between success and failure. Even a minor procedure can lead to catastrophic bleeding if a vessel is injured. In today's era of litigation and heightened patient awareness, convincing patients to undergo surgery is often difficult. The stakes are high, and not everyone wants to live with that level of stress.""""Every operation comes with an adrenaline rush, and coping with that environment is not easy. Surgery isn't just a career choice - it has to be a passion,"" Dr Ranjan said.Another senior doctor noted that while diagnostics requires significant investment, surgical departments face high litigation pressure, contributing to student reluctance to take up the latter.Experts warn the overwhelming tilt towards medicine and radiology could increase shortages in vital surgical specialties over the next decade. For now, India's young doctors appear to have made priorities clear: stability is winning over the scalpel.","In first round of NEET-PG 2025, medicine and radiology dominated choices among high-rankers.
