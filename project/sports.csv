Prospects of Leh talks' resumption brighten,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prospects-of-leh-talks-resumption-brighten/articleshow/123960928.cms,"NEW DELHI: The prospects of early resumption of talks between the Centre and the Apex Body, Leh (ABL) on the latter's demand for safeguards for Ladakh, have brightened with ABL agreeing to drop political parties' representatives from its negotiating team and veteran leader Thupstan Chhewang consenting to lead the dialogue once again.Chhewang and Congress leader Nawang Rigzin Jora had resigned from key positions in ABL ahead of a crucial meeting with the home ministry in July this year. This was after the home ministry, following a round of talks with Ladakh representatives in May 2025, introduced a new reservation and domicile policy for the Union Territory, guaranteeing 85% quota to local domiciles in jobs and reserving one-third seats for women in Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Councils (LAHDC).Jora withdrew from the apex body soon after, affirming the Congress' commitment to securing statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh, ostensibly with an eye on upcoming LAHDC elections. Chhewang, on the other hand, objected to ""partisan agendas"" of some ABL constituents and insisted on the talks remaining ""non-political"". These developments had put the talks in a limbo.With the ABL now agreeing to exclude political parties from its delegation negotiating Ladakh's safeguards, in a move to depoliticise the process, Chhewang has finally agreed to return to lead the talks.The decision follows a resolution by the Ladakh Buddhist Association (LBA), urging separation of politics from ABL and persuasion of Chhewang to head the delegation.ABL has now requested the Centre to resume dialogue, amid concerns that political influence and upcoming LAHDC Leh polls had hindered negotiations. Meanwhile, Sonam Wangchuk's hunger strike over demands for statehood and Sixth Schedule status has evoked mixed response, with many netas favouring talks. ""Given the changed circumstances, the home ministry is inclined to call the APL to the negotiating table soon,"" a central govt officer told TOI.","Talks between the Centre and the Apex Body, Leh (ABL) on the latter's demand for safeguards for Ladakh have brightened. ABL agrees to drop political parties' representatives from its negotiating team and veteran leader Thupstan Chhewang consenting to lead the dialogue once again.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123960952,imgsize-477731,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Cardi B pregnancy ties into Stefon Diggs family story

Stefon Diggs family tree is back in the spotlight after Cardi B revealed she is pregnant with the New England Patriots wide receiver’s child. The rapper confirmed the news during a Sept. 17 interview on CBS Mornings, making it her fourth child and her first with Diggs. The announcement linked one of the NFL’s most productive receivers with one of the biggest names in music, sparking fresh attention on Diggs’ personal life and family roots.Stefon Diggs was born on Nov. 29, 1993, in Gaithersburg, Md., to Aron and Stephanie Diggs. His father, Aron, was instrumental in pushing his sons into football. He coached their youth teams, enforced discipline, and gave Diggs the work ethic that carried him into the NFL. Before passing away from congestive heart failure in 2008 at age 39, Aron told his son to take care of the family. “He just told me, ‘Look after your brothers. Look after your mom. Look after your family,’” Stefon recalled.Stephanie Diggs kept the family together after Aron’s death. She worked three decades at Amtrak while picking up jobs at Target and Toys R Us. Diggs has called her “Superwoman” for raising five kids while working multiple shifts.Today, she travels frequently to watch Stefon play for the Patriots and his younger son Trevon Diggs play cornerback for the Dallas Cowboys.Trevon Diggs is the most well-known of Stefon’s siblings. The Cowboys cornerback was drafted in 2020 and quickly became one of the league’s best at his position. Since their father’s death, Stefon has acted as a mentor and father figure to Trevon. “If you do good things, he’s gonna follow you. If you do bad things, he’s gonna follow you,” Stephanie once told Stefon. That advice defined the way the older brother guided the younger one.The family tree also includes Mar’Sean “Darez” Diggs, who played defensive back at UAB from 2016 to 2018. He shares the same father as Stefon but grew closer to him after Aron’s death. Aron Diggs Jr. is Stefon’s older half-brother, while sister Porsche Green has been described by Stephanie as the glue who helped keep the family together.The most private part of Stefon Diggs family tree is his daughter, Nova. Born in 2016, Nova has appeared alongside her father at NFL games and events but has largely been kept away from public attention. Diggs, who helped raise his siblings after their father’s death, has often spoken about responsibility and the importance of family, values that extend into his role as a parent.Cardi B and Stefon Diggs have been linked since 2024, spotted together at high-profile events like the Met Gala and Coachella. In September 2025, Cardi ended speculation by confirming she is pregnant with Diggs’ child. “I’m having a baby with my boyfriend, Stefon Diggs,” she told Gayle King. The baby is due before her Little Miss Drama tour begins in February 2026.Cardi credited Diggs with providing stability in her life. “He just makes me feel safe and very confident and very strong,” she said. The relationship adds another public layer to Diggs’ family tree, already built on resilience and responsibility. For a player whose life changed after stepping into the role of father figure as a teenager, the connection with Cardi marks the start of a new chapter.Cardi B confirmed she’s expecting her first child with Stefon Diggs but admitted she wanted to keep the news quiet for as long as she could. Speaking with Gayle King on CBS Mornings while promoting her new album Am I The Drama?, she explained why she delayed telling the public, and even her parents. “I just was like, ‘Can I just say it on my own time?’ Like, I’m not hiding. On my time, on my own terms. Let me close some deals first, you know what I’m saying? Let me close some deals first. ” She added, “And it’s like, you don’t really want to say right away that you’re pregnant. It’s like, ‘Let me see a couple of more sonograms. Let my baby be healthy.’”Her parents only recently found out, something she joked about: “They just be looking at me. I’m very scared of my parents!” Still, they’ve welcomed Diggs, who signed with the Patriots in March. Now that the secret’s out, Cardi’s tying the news back to her music. “By the way, now that I talked about it, y’all better get my album,” she told viewers. “Y’all wanted to know, right? Now you know. Now y’all can buy my album, so I can buy Pampers and diapers and all that type of stuff. I told y’all, now go support my album ’cause I’m a mother of four now!” Cardi already shares three kids, Blossom, 12 months, Kulture, 7, and Wave, 4, with her ex-husband, Offset.","Stefon Diggs was born on Nov. 29, 1993, in Gaithersburg, Md., to Aron and Stephanie Diggs.

He was seen enjoying the summer with his wife, Ayesha Curry , and their children - celebrating important milestones in their personal lives, while taking some time off the court. But a new photo of the point guard has caused a frenzy, as Steph looks quite different from his usual self, making the fans go crazy.Stephen Curry is hitting the gym hard, or at least that's what it looks like from a recent photo of him. The Golden State Warriors star looks ripped during a recent event, carrying two heavy weights in both hands.

“As a society, we must be reminded that human life is sacred and never disposable.

We must learn again to disagree with words, not weapons.

Jesus does. And because of Him, Charlie’s voice still echoes — calling us to live with conviction, courage, and hope.

Well done good and faithful servant.”

Travis Kelce faced another brutal loss as Taylor Swift deals with her security concerns



Taylor Swift has always been very concerned about her safety and has mostly missed away games of Travis Kelce’s Kansas City Chiefs due to security concerns. With yesterday’s match being the Chiefs’ first home game of the season, fans were expecting to catch a glimpse of Taylor Swift. But many were left disappointed but fans feel it is because of what might have happened to Charlie Kirk and the other gun violence incidents that happened over the last few days.According to FOX Sports, Taylor Swift did arrive at the Arrowhead Stadium to cheer on Travis Kelce but the billionaire pop star used a large movable wall to sneak into the stadium.Now, fans are very concerned about her safety. A fan by the username @wompingwillowx wrote, “anyone unable to tell this is for her safety is either really dense or mentally immature. she isn’t hiding behind a bullet proof barrier for an easter egg. like bffr. everything that happened last week, people are insane. she wanted to go watch her fiancé in peace and safety.”Another fan by the username @roadnoz wrote, “After what happened this week with all the shootings I’m sure their taking extreme measures for her safety.”A third fan by the username @yeswhaleswiftie posted, “Also not a single camera, at least from what I’ve been watching, has even TRIED to sneak a peak of her in that suite.Shows that this has been discussed by a lot of people and it’s probably for her safety.”·Another fan by the username @humcupcake wrote, “I hate to even bring this up, but do we think this could be about enhanced security due to everything that has been happening?”A fifth fan by the username @LilySunday noted, “It is to do with security. People have no idea the threats this woman receives.

Dana White’s past views on UFC and WWE together

“Some people like WWE. Some people like the UFC. Some people like both. I don’t think there’s ever going to be a day where we turn every UFC fan into a WWE fan or every WWE fan into a UFC fan.” He called Epstein’s statement “one of the dumbest of all time.”

Will they? Won't they? The guesswork continued for days over Pakistan's participation in the ongoing Asia Cup . To make matters worse, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) decided against allowing the team to board the bus for the stadium, for their match against UAE, at the final hour. Thus ensued plenty of back-channel talks and an eventful day of dialogue between PCB, International Cricket Council (ICC) and Asian Cricket Council (ACC).PCB president Mohsin Naqvi and Salman Naseer led the negotiations on their behalf while Sanjog Gupta, the ICC CEO, represented the global cricket body in the negotiations.As a result, the match, due to begin at 6.30pm local time (8:00pm IST), was delayed by an hour.But when the two captains finally lined-up for the toss, match referee Andy Pycroft - the hottest keyword in the last four days - was in position before the coin got a flip. A lot of drama, multiple emails, phone calls, negotiations and allegations preceded Pakistan-UAE toss as Mohsin Naqvi-led PCB were adamant on getting Pycroft removed from the roster for violation of Code of Conduct.In its first email to the ICC on September 15, a day after the India-Pakistan game, the PCB mentioned an ""incident"" - read toss - where Code of Conduct wasn't followed. They questioned the role of match referee Pycroft as the two captains Suryakumar Yadav and Salman Agha didn't shake hands - as is custom. ICC immediately agreed to look into the matter and after doing its due diligence, a response was sent to the PCB stating Pycroft performed his duty well and didn't violate any code of conduct.It was further communicated that he was following the instructions he got from the ACC, chaired by Naqvi, regarding no handshake at toss. The ICC further highlighted that Pycroft handled the situation well and ensured there was no awkward situation on live television. The PCB, however, didn't seem satisfied with the response and responded with the demand of Pycroft's removal from the roster. They added that they would withdraw from the tournament if the Zimbabwean official was not removed from Pakistan's matches.ICC, however, stood its ground and reiterated that Pycroft is not guilty of any code of conduct violation, and asserted they can't change officials as per the demands of any team as it would set a dangerous precedent. When PCB's withdrawal threat didn't work, the ACC also got involved with the same request but ICC didn't budge from its stance once again.As far as the men handling the communication from the Dubai office were concerned, the Pycroft chapter was closed on September 16 but a fresh email from the PCB on September 17 gave a different angle. For the first two days - September 15 and September 16 - all the chatter was around the conduct at toss but on September 17, PCB said there were code of conduct violations during and after the India vs Pakistan match, and again questioned Pycroft's role. In response, the ICC asked PCB for more information and are yet to get a response.Amid all the drama, Pycroft came up with a suggestion and called for a meeting with Pakistan captain Agha and manager Naveed Akram Cheema. It was also attended by coach Mike Hesson in the match referee room at the Dubai International Stadium and Pycroft is learnt to have spoken to the Pakistan camp regarding the possible miscommunication which happened. Was this an apology, as the PCB statement claims? ""There was no question of any apology. Especially from someone who did no wrong,"" says a well-placed source. A video of the meeting is also doing rounds but the audio has been muted.Six emails, a lot of chatter but the only thing which changed was the start time of the Pakistan-UAE contest. Pycroft officiated the fixture and is set to continue doing that for the remainder of the tournament. What next for PCB? They first need to respond to ICC with more information as their previous claims have clearly fallen flat.","PCB demanded match referee Andy Pycroft's removal, alleging code of conduct violations during the India-Pakistan match.

Metallica's song ""Nothing Else Matters"" could be the perfect theme for the Pakistan vs UAE match.For it was a rock-and-roll day in Dubai.The match started an hour late after Pakistan threatened to boycott the Asia Cup if match referee Andy Pycroft continued to officiate the fixture. The players were ready to board the bus at their team hotel but were asked to stay back. In Lahore, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Mohsin Naqvi called up his predecessors — Najam Sethi and Ramiz Raja — to seek advice on how to deal with the ongoing crisis.Following the meeting, the PCB released a statement saying: “ICC match referee Andy Pycroft has apologised to Pakistan’s captain & manager after barring the India vs Pakistan handshake on September 14, calling it a miscommunication.”Then came a press conference in Lahore, and Mohsin Naqvi posted on X: “We have asked the Pakistan team to depart to the Dubai Cricket Stadium.”Meanwhile, PCB also released a muted video showing Pycroft speaking with Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha and coach Mike Hesson.Pycroft walked out for the toss with both captains, did his duty, and left the pitch immediately — offering no handshakes. A couple of hours later, Pakistan brushed aside the UAE by 41 runs to storm into the Super 4s, setting up a blockbuster rematch against arch-rivals India on Sunday at the Dubai International Stadium.But the soap opera wasn’t over.""Let's keep the questions on the match,"" Pakistan’s media manager Naeem Gilani said at the beginning of the post-match press conference.Yet on a day when off-field drama overshadowed cricket, UAE captain Muhammad Waseem and Pakistan pacer Rauf were pressed with tough questions.Both played it cool without giving away much.Pakistan fast bowler Haris Rauf said the team was under no pressure and credited the PCB for handling the situation well.""See, I wasn't feeling any pressure. Because these things are not in my control. These are the decisions of the board, this is a headache for them and they can manage it well,"" Rauf told reporters.""Instead, I had to play a match today. My focus was only on the match. The rest of the things outside of it, management knows better and they have tackled it really well.""UAE captain Muhammad Waseem said his team’s only focus was on cricket and that the delay didn’t matter.""First of all, this is not our responsibility or our work, we are focusing on our game. We came here for the game. We came with a plan for our game, and we planned that only. We came for the warm-up normally, the way we always do, and we were ready for the game,"" the Multan-born cricketer said.""Doesn't matter if we are playing on time or playing late. We came here for the game only, and we played a game. Doesn't matter if we are playing at 6:30 or 7:30, this is not our work — this is for the organisers only.""When asked whether handshake-gate affected camaraderie in the UAE team, given that many players are from India and Pakistan, Waseem categorically denied it.""No, no, we are not talking about that because we are playing too much cricket with each other. We are very used to it, we are here like a family. No Indian, no Pakistani for us. We are playing for UAE, we are playing here as a family, we are living as a family, that's it.""To borrow lines from the iconic Metallica track, the day can be summed up simply: unfazed by the delay, the cricketers were driven by heart to play cricket -- because in the end, nothing else matters.",Pakistan beat UAE by 41 runs to reach the Super 4s of the Asia Cup.

Handshake drama becomes ugly! India vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2025 in DANGER?

Poll Do you think Pakistan will overcome their batting challenges against India? Yes, they will improve No, they will struggle

NEW DELHI: Fresh off the handshake controversy and the recently resolved stand-off with match referee Andy Pycroft , Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha struck a defiant note ahead of the blockbuster Super Four clash against India, declaring that his team is “ready for any challenge.”The tension between the two sides has spilled beyond the boundary rope. Their group-stage meeting in Dubai, played under the shadow of the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, had already triggered calls for a boycott. India thrashed Pakistan by seven wickets and walked straight back to the dressing room, refusing to engage in the customary handshakes. Pakistan’s players responded by skipping the post-match presentation.Ex-cricketers lined up to criticise India’s stance, while the PCB blamed Pycroft for a “breach of conduct” and demanded his removal. The ICC’s refusal escalated the drama, even forcing Pakistan to cancel a scheduled press conference. Matters worsened before the UAE fixture when the team threatened a boycott, staying back at their Dubai Marina hotel until just 30 minutes before the toss. The standoff caused an unprecedented one-hour delay.On the field, Pakistan initially faltered again with the bat, reeling at 128/8 before Shaheen Afridi’s late fireworks — 29 off 14 balls with two sixes and a four — lifted them to 146/9. Though modest, the total proved more than enough, with Salman leading from the front alongside Abrar Ahmed and Saim Ayub as Pakistan’s spinners throttled UAE to seal a 41-run victory and a Super Four berth.Salman, however, was candid about his team’s shortcomings. “We got the job done, but we still need to improve our batting in the middle order. That’s been a concern… we’re still just finding our way to 150. If we bat well in the middle overs, we can push it to 170 no matter the opposition. Shaheen’s batting has improved a lot — he’s already great with the ball,” he said.But it was his rallying cry that set the stage for Sunday’s showdown: “We’re ready for any challenge, and if we keep playing the way we have over the last four months, we’ll be good against any side.”",Pakistan face India in their Super Four clash on Sunday.

Tense faces! Pakistan cricket team arrive at ICC Academy | Will they boycott Asia Cup?

Poll Who do you think is currently the better spinner in international cricket? Kuldeep Yadav Axar Patel

Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma are inseparable in the nets | Exclusive visuals from Dubai

Watching India and Pakistan train at the nets reveals the gulf between the two sides.It starts with the basics — discipline and work ethic — which the Pakistan side lacks.On Tuesday, at the ICC Cricket Academy in Dubai, India and Pakistan trained at the same venue in different time slots. But even the process of training highlighted the gulf between the two teams.India's bus arrived at the venue at 5:20 pm (local time), 40 minutes before their scheduled start. India’s support staff, including side-arm throwers D Raghavendra, Nuwan Seneviratne, and Dayanand Garani, had reached 40 minutes before the team.The troika got to work immediately, setting everything in order. The moment Gautam Gambhir’s team arrived, they slipped into rhythm seamlessly.Two and a half hours later, around 7:50 pm, Pakistan’s bus arrived with just 10 minutes to go before their session. At the same time, the UAE team, who had just finished their nets, were leaving the venue. The Pakistan players stopped to banter with them, as many of the UAE cricketers are of Pakistani origin and had played with them back home.Another 30 minutes passed as Pakistan struggled to figure out what to do. They looked all at sea before captain Salman Ali Agha pulled a football out of his kitbag, and they started playing.To be honest, they were as clueless with football as they were with bat in hand against India on Sunday. Most looked like club-level batters against the Indian attack.Pakistan’s batters were miserable against India’s spin trio — Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy and Axar Patel.After the handshake-gate drama, Pakistan coach Mike Hesson was coaxed into defending his players.“It’s more the accuracy and the pressure that they (Indian spinners) build. When you build up a lot of dot balls, sometimes your mind plays tricks and you play big shots. So it’s not that they can’t pick spin. It’s the fact we struggle to rotate strike and relieve pressure. That’s why dismissals happened in clusters,” Hesson told TimesofIndia.com.Back at Tuesday’s nets, Indian batter Tilak Varma, who has a history of struggling against spin and looked vulnerable against Pakistan too, was facing Kuldeep and Varun in the far nets, with Gautam Gambhir and Sitanshu Kotak keeping a close eye.After 45 exhausting minutes, Tilak was drained and on his knees before being allowed to leave the nets.At the same time, Pakistan’s Saim Ayub, one of their brighter prospects, stood away from the football group, doing shadow practice with Hesson.Meanwhile, Kotak emerged from India’s dressing room with a blackboard clearly listing who would do what in training. In contrast, Pakistan’s session was trial and error.Fakhar Zaman, undone by Axar Patel’s guile on Sunday, was facing Mohammad Nawaz — whom Hesson had once called the world’s best spinner — and was hitting him with ease. Yet Fakhar again struggled against Axar, underlining the difference in quality between the two left-arm spinners.In this era, when every team has at least two side-arm throwers, Pakistan have none. As one veteran Pakistani journalist summed it up: “Hum abhi wahaan nahi pahunche hain (We haven’t reached that level yet).”The six-hour nets marathon — three each for India and Pakistan — can be summed up by Rohit Sharma’s words during the 2019 ODI World Cup, when asked what advice he would give to Pakistan’s struggling batters. Smiling, Rohit had said: “Agar main Pakistan ka coach bana to bilkul bataunga, abhi kya bataunga (If I become Pakistan’s coach, I’ll surely tell them, but not now).”Six years later, the gulf between India and Pakistan cricket has only widened — something that was clearly visible last Sunday, when the so-called rivalry was buried in Dubai’s desert.","On Tuesday, at the ICC Cricket Academy in Dubai, India and Pakistan trained at the same venue in different time slots. But even the process of training highlighted the gulf between the two teams. India's bus arrived at the venue at 5:20 pm (local time), 40 minutes before their scheduled start. Pakistan’s bus arrived with just 10 minutes to go before their session.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123940731,imgsize-32270,width-400,resizemode-4/ind-pak-practice-1709.jpg"

Tense faces! Pakistan cricket team arrive at ICC Academy | Will they boycott Asia Cup?

NEW DELHI: Amid all the drama, chaos, and delays surrounding Pakistan’s Asia Cup campaign, the team finally made it to the Dubai International Stadium to take on the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday. Despite a late start and the lingering controversy from their group-stage loss to India and the handshake saga, Pakistan delivered a strong all-round performance, securing a comfortable 41-run victory and booking their place in the Super Four.With this win, Pakistan not only progress to the Super Four but also set up a high-stakes rematch against India on Sunday at the same venue, promising another thrilling contest.The match started an hour late as Pakistan threatened a pull-out after the handshake fiasco during the previous game against India before Salman Agha's team climbed down and showed up for the game.Put into bat, Pakistan had a shaky start. Saim Ayub fell without scoring, followed shortly by Sahibzada Farhan, leaving the team reeling at 9 for 2 inside the second over.Fakhar Zaman and Salman Agha tried to stabilise the innings, but wickets kept tumbling at regular intervals.Fakhar made a valiant 50, while captain Salman Agha contributed 20 before falling to Dhruv Parashar.Shaheen Afridi’s late hitting proved decisive, finishing unbeaten on 29 and guiding Pakistan to a defendable total of 146 for 9 in 20 overs. Afridi had previously impressed with 33 not out, including four sixes, against India.Junaid Siddique starred with the ball for UAE, picking up four vital wickets for 34 runs, while Simranjeet Singh claimed three more.Chasing 147, UAE tried to adopt a cautious approach to avoid another low total, but their slow scoring made the target unrealistic.Rahul Chopra (35) and Dhruv Parashar (20) added 48 for the fourth wicket, but it wasn’t enough.Pakistan maintained control throughout, and from 85 for 3 after 14 overs, UAE collapsed to 105 all out in 17.4 overs.","Pakistan beat United Arab Emirates by 41 runs to progress to Super Four.

'Sugar' Shane Mosley reveals who he thinks is the better fighter: Floyd Mayweather or Terence Crawford,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/sugar-shane-mosley-reveals-who-he-thinks-is-the-better-fighter-floyd-mayweather-or-terence-crawford/articleshow/123950657.cms,"Shane Mosley (Image Source: Getty)

Shane Mosley’s verdict on the question

Terence Crawford is winning hearts with his exceptional skills

Crawford BETTER than Mayweather - Shane Mosley SOUNDS OFF!

“Crawford would have the edge,”

Boxing legend “Sugar” Shane Mosley has hopped into one of the sport’s most heated debates. The question is, who’s the better fighter, Floyd Mayweather Jr. or Terence “Bud” Crawford? Having shared the ring with Mayweather himself, Mosley’s opinion carries real weight, and his answer may surprise fans of the undefeated icon.Speaking to Fight Hub TV, the former three-division world champion made it clear that while Mayweather was “very talented,” he believes Crawford edges him out as the more complete fighter. He thinks Crawford is better, bigger, like he’s actually moving weight class, and he feels Crawford is a better all-around fighter. He added that although a Mayweather vs. Crawford bout would be a close, high-level contest, Crawford’s physical advantages, like longer reach and natural size, would tilt the fight in his favor.Mosley clearly knows what it’s like to face Mayweather. The two had a face-off 15 years ago. Mosley lost a unanimous decision to the man many consider the greatest boxer of his era. Mayweather retired with a remarkable 50-0 record. He collected titles across five weight divisions and redefined the art of defense inside the ring. He made a legacy as one of boxing’s most brilliant tacticians.But Crawford is making his own case for greatness. At 37, the Omaha native recently made his name in history by defeating Canelo Alvarez.This made him the first male fighter ever to claim undisputed status in three separate weight classes. That victory pushed him back to the top of the rankings and sparked a new round of comparisons to legends like Mayweather.Mosley’s comments ignited the dimly burning flame. He highlighted Crawford’s versatility. His effortless punching power and ability to move seamlessly through weight divisions make him stand out. Mosley suggests that the current generation may finally have produced someone who could beat Mayweather’s standing.Also Read: American Gaming Association allegedly investigating Adin Ross for Insider Trading in Canelo Alvarez vs. Terence Crawford fight The hypothetical matchup between Mayweather and Crawford will certainly stir debate among boxing enthusiasts. While it will never happen in the ring, the conversation itself underscores the sport’s richness.

Wexler-NorthJersey.com)

Justin Fields enters concussion protocol after brutal hit vs. Bills



Tyrod Taylor steps in as the Jets’ starter against the Buccaneers



What this means for the Jets’ season outlook



The New York Jets’ quarterback drama just won’t quit. Just two weeks into the season, the team has already been hit with another setback, Justin Fields is officially sidelined after entering the NFL’s concussion protocol. That means veteran Tyrod Taylor will get the start on Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. For Jets fans, it’s déjà vu, another year, another QB storyline that changes before the season even gets rolling.The injury happened late in the Jets’ Week 2 loss to the Buffalo Bills. Fields was sacked by edge rusher Joey Bosa and went down hard, hitting the turf in the fourth quarter. He was quickly evaluated for a head injury and ruled out, and on Monday, coach Aaron Glenn confirmed the worst, Fields is in the concussion protocol and won’t be cleared to play this week.It was a rough outing even before the injury. Fields completed just 3 of 11 passes for 27 yards, though he did manage 49 rushing yards. The Jets’ offense never found its rhythm, and losing their starting quarterback only added to the frustration.With Fields sidelined, the Jets will turn to a familiar veteran presence in Tyrod Taylor. The 35-year-old came in late against Buffalo and immediately gave the offense a spark, throwing a touchdown and showing poise under pressure.Taylor is no stranger to situations like this. Over his career, he’s been called on multiple times to step in when starters go down from Buffalo to Cleveland to the Giants. For the Jets, his steady play and ability to avoid mistakes could be exactly what the offense needs against a tough Buccaneers defense.This was supposed to be Justin Fields’ redemption season. After arriving in New York, the expectation was that he’d use his athleticism and playmaking ability to stabilize a team still reeling from last year’s Aaron Rodgers injury. Instead, just two games in, the Jets are already making another quarterback switch.The bigger question: how long will Fields be out? Concussion protocol timelines vary, but even a short absence could derail the Jets’ early momentum. In a crowded AFC, dropping winnable games in September can come back to haunt teams chasing playoff spots. Until then, Jets fans will be holding their breath, hoping this isn’t the start of another season derailed by quarterback injuries.Also read - “This will be a disaster”: Fans roast Stefon Diggs as Cardi B confirms pregnancy with him","Justin Fields was sacked by Joey Bosa and went down hard, hitting the turf in the fourth quarter.

Patrick Mahomes’ birthday brings good news for Chiefs as Xavier Worthy and Jalen Royals return

Film Study: What went WRONG for Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs V the Philadelphia Eagles

Mahomes gains offensive boost as Xavier Worthy and Jalen Royals return to Chiefs’ lineup

Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes celebrated his 30th birthday Wednesday, and the team received a much-needed boost. Wide receivers Xavier Worthy and Jalen Royals returned to practice after lengthy injury absences, providing Mahomes and the Chiefs with key weapons ahead of Sunday night’s matchup against the New York Giants. Their return offers hope for an offense struggling to find its rhythm.Worthy and Royals missed the early part of the season due to separate injuries. Worthy suffered a shoulder injury in the season opener, while Royals battled a knee problem sustained during training camp. Coach Andy Reid confirmed that both receivers are now practicing without restrictions and are expected to be fully available for Sunday’s game.The Chiefs offense has faced significant challenges, with Mahomes completing just under 60% of his passes and averaging around 222 passing yards in losses to the Chargers and Eagles. Adding to the difficulties, Rashee Rice remains sidelined due to a six-game suspension, leaving the team thin at wide receiver. Marquise Brown has been the most consistent target, but the absence of key playmakers has hampered the team’s overall production.Worthy’s return is especially significant, as his speed and playmaking ability can instantly stretch defenses. Last season, he stepped up when the Chiefs faced similar injuries, exceeding expectations and establishing himself as a reliable offensive threat. Royals, a fourth-round pick from Utah State, adds agility and quickness, which can help offset the absence of suspended or injured teammates.Patrick Mahomes expressed optimism about their return. “I'm just excited to get those guys back and, you know, go out there and try to have some success on offense better than we did last week,” he said. Their presence should allow Mahomes to rebuild chemistry and improve the passing attack, which has struggled early in the season.Also Read: Chargers’ Keenan Allen thrives despite Alien shoulders and injury setbacks While Mahomes’ birthday may have been quieter than usual due to the team’s 0-2 start, the return of Worthy and Royals provides a positive turning point.

Saudi Pro League emerges as football’s reunion stage

1. Cristiano Ronaldo & João Félix (Al-Nassr)

2. Sadio Mané & Kingsley Coman (Al-Nassr)

3. Georginio Wijnaldum & Jordan Henderson (Al-Ettifaq)

4. N’Golo Kanté & Karim Benzema (Al-Ittihad)

5. Alex Telles & Cristiano Ronaldo (Al-Nassr)

6. Alexandre Lacazette & Said Benrahma (Neom SC)

What this tells us about Saudi Football’s progression

When global stars move to a new league, there’s always talk of dazzling signings, but perhaps more intriguing are the reunions of players linking up again after shared pasts. The Saudi Pro League today isn’t just shopping for talent; it’s assembling alumni networks: club rosters where national team comrades and former clubmates are rejoining.These reunions bring chemistry, storylines, and a sense that the league is maturing in not just buying names but creating narratives. Below are confirmed renewed partnerships, rumored near misses, and why this trend matters.Here are several high-profile pairings of players who were teammates before and now find themselves together again in Saudi Arabia:Though they were never club teammates until now, they are long-time national teammates for Portugal. Félix’s arrival in July 2025 to Al-Nassr reunited him with Ronaldo under the same club framework.The two played together at Bayern Munich during the 2022-23 season.Coman left Bayern in August 2025 to join Al-Nassr, joining Mané, who had moved earlier in 2023. Their reunion adds veteran understanding to Al-Nassr’s forward line.Their link stretches back to Liverpool, where they played together in the midfield.Wijnaldum joined Al-Ettifaq in 2023, joining Henderson, who was already there.Both are French internationals, and though they are not always in the same club, their shared national team history is strong. Kanté’s move to Al-Ittihad in 2023 reunited him with Benzema, already at the club.At Manchester United, Telles and Ronaldo overlapped; later, Telles moved to Al-Nassr (2023), rejoining Ronaldo under a different flag.A more recent reunion: Lacazette has joined Neom SC ahead of the 2025/26 season, reuniting with former Lyon teammate Said Benrahma.These reunions are not just coincidences; they’re signs. Saudi clubs are no longer just throwing money; they are attracting players who want more than salary, like mental comfort, playing with familiar teammates, and shared history. That has appeal, especially for seasoned players.Reuniting players who already know each other helps reduce adjustment time, both in understanding each other’s play styles and in off-field adaptation. Clubs like Al-Nassr and Al-Ittihad. Al-Ettifaq are investing in squads with multiple stars who know each other.Fans love narratives like “These two used to win UEFA Champions Leagues together” or “These midfield veterans dominated Europe together.”That helps the league market itself globally. It’s no longer just “which big name is arriving,” but “which combinations” are forming.If you want ambition, pairing stars with past success shows you believe in more than just flashy transfers. It shows a plan: build a core, build chemistry.","Cristiano Ronaldo, João Félix, Sadio Mané, N’Golo Kanté, Alex Telles, Jordan Henderson and Alexandre Lacazette have all reunited in Saudi Pro League.

Why Brazilian MMA star Wanderlei Silva got a lifetime ban for skipping UFC drug test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/why-brazilian-mma-star-wanderlei-silva-got-a-lifetime-ban-for-skipping-ufc-drug-test/articleshow/123952677.cms,"Wanderlei Silva (Image Source: Getty)

What prompted the lifetime ban for Wanderlei Silva

Legal challenge and ban reduction

Implications and legacy

Controversy surrounded the renowned MMA fighter Wanderlei ""The Axe Murderer"" Silva in 2014 for allegedly evading random drug testing. The NSAC had, in fact, gone ahead to issue a lifetime ban against Wanderlei, additionally fining him $70,000. This is how the affair unfolded and how, later, Silva managed to get the ruling amended.In May of 2014, Silva was training to face Chael Sonnen at UFC 175. As per NSAC's regulations, there was an attempt to conduct a surprise random drug test at Silva's exercise gym in Las Vegas. Upon their arrival, Silva apparently sneaked through the back exit and escaped the drug sample collection.During the ""information gathering"" session, Silva admitted that he was taking diuretics, which are banned by athletic commissions. He claimed to use them to cut down inflammation and water retention following a wrist injury sustained earlier in the year. Diuretics are not always performance-enhancing directly, but they are banned because they could mask or flush out other drugs.Because he refused to comply with the test (he ran from it), and because he admitted to taking diuretics, the NSAC imposed what was at that time considered the harshest penalty: a lifetime ban against Silva competing in Nevada, along with a fine of $70,000.The NSAC thus felt they had to take such an action in view of the seriousness of skipping a drug test and avoiding oversight.Silva did not go down without a fight. He appealed the decision in January 2015, claiming the NSAC did not have jurisdiction because he had not yet been issued a fighter’s license in Nevada at the time the test was attempted. He argued the punishment was therefore “arbitrary and capricious”. A judge in the Nevada District Court later agreed that the lifetime ban and fine were excessive and beyond what the NSAC was authorised to impose. He ordered a new hearing.Also Read: No Second Chances: Dana White Issues Lifetime Ban for UFC Fighter’s Post-Fight Outburst After the rehearing, in February 2016, the NSAC rescinded the lifetime ban and reduced the penalty to a three-year suspension, retroactive to May 24, 2014, with the result that Silva would again be eligible in 2017. Also, the $70,000 fine was rescinded.There are frequent allusions in MMA regulatory circles to the Silva occurrence as a textbook case. It is a testament to how athletic commissions take seriously the need for compliance with anti-doping rules before a positive test, particularly when the athlete tries to evade or avoid testing. It also emphasises how due process enters the arena; large-name fighters do challenge bans, especially when jurisdictional questions, fairness, and proportional discipline arise.For Silva, it meant a long time of uncertainty about his MMA career and lost opportunities, especially in Nevada and with the UFC, and an injury to his reputation. After the ruling reversal, he was able to return to competition upon expiry of the suspension under other promotions.","Wanderlei Silva was banned for life by the Nevada State Athletic Commission in 2014.

Admitting pressure and overthinking hurt his game, Scott hopes this carefree approach will spark a turnaround ahead of the postseason.

Struggles in Tanner Scott’s First Year with the Los Angeles Dodgers

Adopting a Carefree Mindset to Regain His Rhythm

Pressure from Contract and Team Expectations Weighing on Him

The Harsh Realities of Major League Baseball

After a standout 2024 season, Tanner Scott secured a lucrative four-year, $72 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers. In that previous year, he posted a stellar 1.75 ERA across 72 appearances (72.0 innings pitched), earning recognition as one of the league’s most reliable bullpen arms. The Dodgers, coming off a championship season, were eager to bolster their bullpen depth, especially in high-leverage late-game situations. Scott’s addition was seen as a way to provide even more stability in the ninth inning and help the team close out games more confidently.However, Tanner Scott’s first season with the Los Angeles Dodgers has not lived up to those lofty expectations. While he avoided being directly responsible for the Dodgers’ recent collapse against the Philadelphia Phillies - when the team gave up three runs in the top of the ninth and fell 9 - 6 - his overall struggles have been hard to ignore. Scott has openly admitted his frustration with his performance, even expressing at one point that “baseball hates him. ” His inability to find answers on the mound has left him searching for a way to reset mentally and physically.With the playoffs approaching, Tanner Scott has embraced a radically different mindset. Instead of trying to overthink his approach or pressure himself with expectations, he’s adopting a more carefree, “let it go” attitude.“Well, I kind of just have the (to heck with it) attitude right now. I don’t know. I’m just trying to go out there right now and not think. Just say, ‘Fk it,’” Scott explained, as reported by Bill Plunkett of the Orange County Register. “I mean, that’s how I always pitched. I kind of lost it this year. Now I’m back to ‘Fk it.’” Scott hopes that by returning to this mentality, he can rediscover the confidence and performance that defined his earlier success.It’s possible that the weight of his big contract and the pressure of playing for a high-profile team like the Los Angeles Dodgers have taken a toll on Scott’s composure. Yet, despite the rocky start, there’s still time for him to turn things around. A strong showing in the postseason could quickly erase memories of his struggles this year and re-establish him as one of the bullpen’s most dependable arms.Also read: Usher Shares How $365 Million Los Angeles Dodgers Superstar Warned Him About Serenading Married Fans: “Leave the Cherries at Home!” Scott’s experience shows the difficulty of maintaining elite performance at the highest level of baseball. Every player in the majors possesses exceptional athletic ability, meaning that even the smallest slip in mechanics, velocity, or confidence can lead to significant setbacks. “You always want to perform to the standard that you believe you are and the team and the fans see you as. When (stuff) goes south, you never want it to happen. But if baseball was easy, everyone would be playing it,” Tanner Scott admitted. His situation is a reminder that success in the sport depends as much on mental resilience as it does on raw talent.","Tanner Scott signed a lucrative four-year, $72 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers.

'My job is to play': Haris Rauf stays calm as Pakistan ride out Asia Cup drama

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ramiz Raja has accused International Cricket Council (ICC) match referee Andy Pycroft of blatant bias, branding him a “favourite for the Indians” in the wake of the handshake controversy and mounting tensions at the Asia Cup in Dubai.Pakistan’s players had refused to leave their hotel ahead of their must-win fixture against the UAE on Wednesday, demanding Pycroft’s removal after the fallout from their heated clash with India. Although they eventually received clearance to play, the game was delayed by an hour. The PCB also cancelled the pre-match press conference.Speaking at a joint press conference alongside PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi, Ramiz Raja did not hold back, questioning Pycroft’s track record. “What’s interesting is… Andy Pycroft is favourite [for the Indians]. Whenever I host tosses, he’s always a permanent fixture over there,” Raja charged.Raja argued that Pycroft had been disproportionately appointed for India’s matches, raising doubts about the ICC’s neutrality. “This is something blatant for me because, though I thought he had refereed several matches, stats seemingly show something one-sided.It should not be like this. This is a neutral platform, which is why there are referees and match officials. However, I felt that he was fixed there. But I hope that better sense prevails,” he added.The PCB alleged Pycroft had directly prohibited India captain Suryakumar Yadav and Pakistan skipper Salman Agha from shaking hands after their high-voltage encounter, later classifying the incident as a “miscommunication.” In a strongly-worded statement on X, the board said: “ICC’s controversial match referee Andy Pycroft has apologised to the manager and captain of the Pakistani cricket team… The ICC has expressed its readiness to investigate the violation of the Code of Conduct.”However, ICC sources have since refuted Pakistan’s claims, clarifying that no formal investigation has been initiated and that Pycroft was not guilty of any breach. The apology, they stressed, was due to a venue manager’s error.Despite the uproar, Pycroft returned to duty at the Dubai International Stadium, officiating Pakistan’s clash against the UAE, leaving the controversy far from settled.",Former Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ramiz Raja has accused International Cricket Council (ICC) match referee Andy Pycroft of blatant bias.

Where to watch and what’s at stake

Qatar prepares for the fourth round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers, held by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). The national team was third in the previous round and now moves into a centralized group with the other top sides finishing in the top four of earlier groups. These remaining games will be crucial to their quest for an automatic berth to the 2026 World Cup or a spot in the playoffs. From here on out, every point absolutely counts, and the pressure is beginning to pile.The next match for Qatar in the AFC fourth round of the World Cup qualifiers will be an away clash against Oman on Wednesday, October 8, 2025, at 11.00 AM Doha time. This game is the first of their fourth-round campaign and will be crucial for establishing an early tone in the group.After this, Qatar will be back home to host the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday, October 14, 2025, with the kick-off at 1:15 PM Doha time. Both these fixtures are part of Matchdays 1 and 3 of the AFC's fourth round, which takes place from October 8 to 14, 2025. Finally, in the fourth round, there are three groups of four teams, with the winners going through automatically and the second-placed teams entering the playoff round in November.Also Read: Why Majed Abdullah Is Called the ‘Desert Pele’ of Saudi Arabia: All About the Football Icon Qatar's FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers will be available to fans exclusively on its AFC broadcast and streaming partners, which include various regional sports networks and some ESPN-affiliated services.
