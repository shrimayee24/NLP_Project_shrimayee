“Neither Janmat Nor Janpath”: Bjp Alleges Growing Rebellion Against Rahul Gandhi Within Congress

NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday hit out at Rahul Gandhi and claimed he was losing support within Congress , allies and even his family as it seized on the comments of CPM MP John Brittas and Congress MP Imran Masood. With Robert Vadra chiming in to say there was countrywide support for the “Priyanka-as-PM” view, BJP moved in, calling the remarks a “show of no-confidence” in Rahul’s leadership that rattled him into going abroad and venting his anger.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla told a presser Rahul had been making “anti-India” remarks from Germany in his frustration. He noted Brittas’s statement that seasoned DMK MP T R Baalu had raised the issue of Rahul’s visit abroad when Parliament was debating key issues.BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandhari said, “Open fight between Rahul and Priyanka camps in Congress. Divide in Congress out in the open. Congress vs Congress.”Poonawalla suggested that the leadership issue has been simmering within Congress, referring to the recent expulsion of former Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim for his veiled criticism of Rahul and push for a central leadership for Priyanka. He also cited Congress MP Shashi Tharoor’s praise of development works in Bihar to slam RahulAs Rahul is becoming “politically dead”, the LoP has become “leader of propaganda” and has been making claims like Indian economy and democracy are dead, the BJP functionary said, challenging him to provide proof of his recent charge that a woman in Haryana voted 200 times.",BJP hit out at Rahul Gandhi and claimed he was losing support within Congress.

Rahul Gandhi Attacks Modi Govt In Germany, Says 'West, India Handed Over Production To China'

NEW DELHI: CPM MP John Brittas on Tuesday questioned leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi's absence from Parliament in the final days of winter session when crucial bills, including VB-G RAM G, were passed despite opposition's protests. He also criticised Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's participation at the end of the session in the tea meeting hosted by Lok Sabha Speaker OM Birla in his chambers, which was also attended by PM Narendra Modi.""It was a desire that when a crucial legislation like VB-G RAM G is being bulldozed in Parliament along with other crucial bills on nuclear energy and insurance, we expected the leader of opposition (Rahul) to lead INDIA bloc or opposition rank and file. That was an expectation and a desire,"" he told NDTV.Speaking to channels and news agencies, Brittas also said that he was not alone and other politicians from INDIA bloc too felt the same way about Rahul's absence. He said they felt that Rahul's presence would have made a big difference. ""The calendar of winter session is known to all members. So, I feel the LoP would have looked at the session's calendar and in all fairness he should have been there.Rahul's presence would have made a big difference,"" he reiterated.However, Brittas said that it is up to Rahul and his party to decide whether he needs to be in Parliament or he needs to be elsewhere.On Priyanka's decision to attend the tea meeting, Brittas was clear that it sends out the ""wrong message"" and cited how in past sessions, when govt passed waqf bill and did not hold a discussion on special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, opposition skipped these meetings. ""Compared to all those boycotts, this was a humongous issue,"" he told ANI referring to VB-G RAM G's passage.""Just couple of hours after bulldozing the bill to eliminate MGNREGA, it was not a good scene for us to see Priyanka and others sitting at the tea party along with the PM,"" he added.",CPM MP John Brittas questioned leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi's absence from Parliament in the final days of winter session.

Renowned Hindi writer Vinod Shukla dies at 88,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/renowned-hindi-writer-vinod-shukla-dies-at-88/articleshow/126148364.cms,"PTI file photo

RAIPUR/NEW DELHI: Vinod Kumar Shukla, who created a universe of quiet grace from the small histories and inner worlds of ordinary people in his novels and poems, and who became the first Jnanpith awardee from Chhattisgarh last year - passed away Tuesday. He was 88.The renowned Hindi writer was undergoing treatment for a lung ailment in the Chhattisgarh capital since Dec 2 and was on ventilator support since Dec 19. His body had weakened but his resolve to write remained unswerving.""He carried a writing pad, even inside the ICU. In the hospital, he wrote his last poem. Probably inspired by what he had observed around him,"" his son Shashwat told TOI.His last poem, penned in an infirm hand from his hospital bed on Dec 6, went: ""Batti maine pehle bujhayee / Phir tumne bujhayee / Phir dono ne mil kar bujhayee (I turned out the light first / then you did / then we turned it off together).""In a conversation with PM Modi some weeks back, he had said, ""Writing is like breathing for me. I want to return home as soon as possible - I want to keep writing.""PM condoled the writer's passing in a post on X, ""He will always be remembered for his invaluable contribution to the world of literature.""Shukla wrote sparingly, but deeply. He wrote in a tone that never needed to raise itself. His prose moved gently like the wind, his poetry like breath.His writing did not insist; it illuminated. And it traversed the vacant space between remembering and forgetting.""Forgetting is my nature. I forget, again and again. Since forgetting is my nature, so is remembering. If I forget, I also remember. Forgetting is a form of leaving behind. Remembering is trying to bring it back,"" he told actor Manav Kaul in director Achal Mishra's documentary on his life, 'Chaar Phool Hain Aur Duniya Hai' (2024).Naukar Ki Kameez (The servant's shirt, 1979) was his most celebrated work. The novel was adapted by renowned filmmaker Mani Kaul into a feature film in 1999. ""Initial sales were slow. But after 2020, it became a best-seller,"" says Satyanand Nirupam, editor, Rajkamal Prakashan. A Facebook Live presentation by him was watched by a high 18,000 viewers during the 2020 Covid lockdown.""In 2025, it sold 10,000 copies, a huge number for a book released five decades ago,"" says Nirupam. Some months back, there was even an unpleasant online controversy over the royalty he had earned.Shukla was born in Rajnandgaon, now part of west Chhattisgarh. A post-graduate in krishi vigyan (agriculture science) from Jabalpur, his first poetry collection, Lagbhag Jai Hind (Almost Jai Hind) was published in 1971.As a writer, Shukla never carried the baggage of literary politics. Perhaps a reason why fame trickled to him, like water dripping from a tap in a desert town. He received the Sahitya Akademi award in 1999 for his novel, Deewar Mein Ek Khidki Rehti Thi (A window lived in the wall). Khilega To Dekhenge (Will see when it blooms) was another feted work.In 2023, he became the first Indian to receive the PEN/Nabokov Award. ""Writing for decades without the recognition he deserves, Shukla has created literature that changes how we understand the modern,"" the PEN/Nabokov judges panel said.Sahitya Akademi recipient writer Mridula Garg says that Shukla was truly one of a kind. ""Articulate but not verbose, simple but not simplistic, real but not realistic, individualistic but not self-centered. Equally empathetic to individual and social desires and ills,"" she says.Another Sahitya Akademi awardee Anamika poetically puts it that in Shukla's poems and novels ""we meet a lonely man full of empathy and grace, a man of the community, a man like the Christ on cross in Rembrandt's painting, a man who belongs - his bones hanging, skin sagging, the pain of inner struggle writ large on his face.""Senior journalist Sunil Kumar, who was associated with Shukla for decades, said, ""He was the most prominent Hindi writer of significance in the last half a century, but his feet remained solidly on the ground. Shukla ji was a man of unique simplicity, in language, life, and values, all. He had a strange ability to remain aloof from praise or criticism, success or failures.""When asked for his reaction on receiving the Jnanpith, India's most prestigious literary award, Shukla had said, ""Mujhe likhna bahut tha, lehin bahut kam likh paya,"" (I had a lot to write, but could write very little."" Following his demise, every reader too enchanted by his world of writing has been left wanting for more.","Vinod Kumar Shukla, the first Jnanpith awardee from Chhattisgarh, dies at 88. He was undergoing treatment for a lung ailment in the Chhatt isgarh capital. His last poem, penned in an infirm hand from his hospital bed on Dec 6, went: ""Batti maine pehle bujhayee / Phir tumne bujHayee""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126148367,imgsize-858062,width-400,resizemode-4/pti-file-photo.jpg"

He handled his normal role, took his usual shots, and finished the night without any setback. With no new injury listed, Charlotte is preparing as if its lead guard will be available.LaMelo Ball's wrist issue surfaced ahead of Monday’s game against Cleveland, where Ball was initially listed as probable. He ended up playing and logged full minutes. On Tuesday, the concern appears to have eased enough that it no longer appears on the report.Ball scored 23 points in that game and hit six three-pointers. The shot volume and accuracy suggested the wrist was manageable, even if it was not fully pain-free.Against Cleveland, LaMelo Ball led Charlotte Hornets in scoring and assists. The Hornets made 21 threes as a team but allowed 24, which proved to be the difference in a 139-132 loss.Through the season, Ball is averaging 19.4 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 8.6 assists.With Charlotte sitting at 9–20, most of the offense continues to run through him, especially late in games.Before Monday, LaMelo Ball had dealt with ankle trouble earlier in the season, which kept him out briefly. The wrist soreness was the latest issue, but his availability against Cleveland and clean status Tuesday suggest the team is confident it is under control.The Charlotte Hornets’ injury report for Tuesday is still listed as “not yet submitted,” but Ball is not mentioned. That contrasts with Washington’s report, which includes multiple rotation players.Washington enters the game with uncertainty across its lineup. Marvin Bagley III is questionable due to left calf soreness. Bilal Coulibaly is also questionable with a left ankle sprain. Cam Whitmore has been ruled out with right shoulder soreness.The Wizards have struggled on the road, holding a 3-12 record away from home, and could be short-handed again if those players sit.The game tips off at 7 p.m. ET at Spectrum Center. Charlotte Hornets are looking to rebound after a close loss and needs stability on offense. Ball’s availability helps on that front. One situation to monitor is the frontcourt, as Mason Plumlee is dealing with a groin injury from Monday that could affect Charlotte’s rotation inside.","LaMelo Ball's name does not appear on the Charlotte Hornets' injury report for Tuesday's game against the Washington Wizards.

Steve Kerr gets Draymond Green frustrated during the game against the Orlando Magic

Also Read

One of the biggest regrets for Steve Kerr is a moment from his games during the Michael Jordan era. It was the Christmas Day game from 1994. The Chicago Bulls were facing the New York Knicks and the former team was leading the game with 3.3 seconds remaining. However, during the last few seconds, Kerr commits a blunder that sends the game into overtime. Even then, the Bulls managed to win the game. But Kerr still remembers his mistake. While talking to ESPN, he candidly admitted that he would have been the “GOAT” for this mistake.Scottie Pippen was the highest scorer of the game. He racked up 36 points with 16 rebounds and 3 assists. Following right up were Tony Kukoc and BJ Armstrong. They added 25 and 16 points to the team’s final score. Kerr played for 28 minutes and added 9 points with 1 rebound and 2 assists.Steve Kerr lives with one of his biggest regrets. He believed that a game that could have ended faster went into overtime because of him. It was the last few seconds of the second half. The Chicago Bulls were dominating the game with a 3-point lead. Anthony Mason gave his all towards the end to secure a dunk for the New York Knicks.At this point, Kerr jumped right in to block the dunk and tried to tap the ball to one of his teammates. But none of his teammates received the ball. Instead, it was the Knicks’ guard who received the ball and scored a 3-pointer. It brought both teams to an even and the game went into overtime.Steve Kerr still regrets it. He stated in an interview with ESPN, “It was the biggest mistake I've ever made. It was a huge gaffe. It was just dumb. One of the biggest nightmares of my career.” Kerr further added, “I would've been the goat. Not the good GOAT. The bad goat. It worked out, but it was humiliating. It was just the dumbest play. I still don't quite know why I did it.”What makes him feel worse is that even now, every year, the league would have a throwback to some of the major Christmas Day games in the past. “The problem is now every Christmas Day when they start playing [vintage] games on NBA TV, they still show that. I'm like, f**k, would you guys leave me alone?""Scottie Pippen saved the day for Kerr. During overtime, Scottie gave his best and racked up 7 points to lead the team to victory. Immediately after the game, Scottie hugged Kerr to ease the atmosphere.According to Marc Spears from NBA Today, Draymond Green got into a heated argument with the team’s head coach, Steve Kerr. Green has been quite unhappy about Kerr’s defensive approach and in the game against the Orlando Magic, the athlete got into a heated argument with the head coach. Later, Green abruptly left the game and did not return.","Steve Kerr regrets his biggest career mistake from the 1994 Christmas Day game against the New York Knicks.

Draymond Green Christmas suspension was a blessing in disguise



Draymond Green Warriors suspension came during personal and professional strain



Draymond Green has lived most of his adult life with Christmas circled on an NBA calendar. In December 2023, his usual Christmas routine unexpectedly stopped. A league suspension forced Green away from the court and into his living room. It was a blessing in disguise for the Warriors veteran as he got to be right where his children were opening gifts.The moment came during one of the most difficult stretches of his career. While Green was frustrated at the moment of the huge suspension, years later, he realized that it was the best Christmas moment of his life. Certainly, it was not the right way but almost every NBA star has the thirst to spend time with their family during this time.Draymond Green admitted that Christmas rarely feels familiar for NBA players. Road games often erase the traditions many grow up loving. His entire Christmas routine for a year changed during his 12-game suspension after the incident involving Jusuf Nurkic.""That was great. It was actually f---ing amazing,"" Green told ESPN. ""Usually it's weird because Christmas Day is not like what you remember as a kid, where you spend with your family.We've been on the road [five times, once when Green was suspended]. I know my 5-year-old's first Christmas, I was gone.""Instead of boarding a flight to Denver, Green stayed home. He opened presents with his children. He experienced a full Christmas morning. In previous seasons, he found small ways to cope, sometimes letting his kids open a gift before tipoff and saving the rest for later.Despite being one of only 10 players to record a Christmas Day triple-double, Green admitted the holiday can feel heavy.""As an NBA player, you want to be on that stage, marquee games and everybody's watching,"" Green said. ""But as a human, it f---ing sucks, if I'm honest.""... I absolutely loved as a kid watching NBA games on Christmas Day. Kobe Bryant and the white [Lakers] jerseys. I loved [Shaquille O'Neal]. ... But the NFL has started having games on Christmas Day, so maybe they take Christmas over and we go home.""The suspension stemmed from a flagrant foul against Nurkic and added to a season filled with tension. The NBA cited Green’s history of unsportsmanlike acts and required meetings with league officials before his return. Financial penalties followed. So did public scrutiny.""I am not one to apologize for things I mean to do, but I do apologize to Jusuf because I didn't intend to hit him,"" Green said after the game. ""I sell calls with my arms ... so I was selling the call ... and I swung and unfortunately I hit him.""Inside the Warriors organization, they needed him available.""We need him. We need Draymond. He knows that,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""He's got to find a way to keep his poise and be out there for his teammates.""Regardless, for Green, that unexpected suspension came as a gift and one of his most meaningful holiday memories.Also Read: “It always could be worse” – Carmelo Anthony’s son Kiyan reveals what really connects him with LeBron’s son Bronny James","Draymond Green has lived most of his adult life with Christmas circled on an NBA calendar.

“Respect for the courts and for the child comes first,”

Ilia Topuria is known to fans for his rise in the UFC and his recent title success. But away from the octagon, a serious personal issue is unfolding. His ongoing divorce has now moved into a more serious phase after his ex-wife took legal action in Spain.Just days before Christmas, the private family matter entered the public eye. Giorgina Uzcategui, Ilia Topuria’s ex-wife, formally approached the police after claiming she received threats and abusive messages online linked to the divorce.On December 22, 2024, Giorgina Uzcategui appeared at Spain’s National Police headquarters in Madrid. According to journalist Ani Moro from ¡HOLA!, she filed an official complaint over online threats and harassment she says began during the divorce proceedings with Ilia Topuria.The complaint reportedly included screenshots and records of messages. After her statement, the case was forwarded to the Civil Guard, which handles matters in the area where she lives.Authorities have not shared details of the messages, and no criminal charges or protective orders have been made public so far.Giorgina Uzcategui has stayed quiet since the separation became public. In earlier remarks through her team, she said the divorce is a private family issue, especially because a child is involved.The couple shares a daughter born in 2024. Ilia Topuria also has a son from a previous relationship.Her silence, she explained, was not avoidance. It was a choice made to protect her child and respect the legal process. Filing the police complaint marked the first time authorities were formally involved in the matter.Ilia Topuria has not directly addressed the complaint. However, earlier this month, he confirmed that personal and legal problems played a role in his temporary break from competition. He did not name Giorgina Uzcategui but admitted the situation was serious.A few days after the police filing, Giorgina Uzcategui’s legal team released a short public statement. Her lawyer, Cristina Corell Cortina, described the divorce as ainvolving a minor.The statement asked media and the public to avoid speculation. It rejected what it called harmful interpretations spreading online. The lawyer did not answer Ilia Topuria’s claims point by point and avoided emotional language.Instead, the message focused on restraint.the statement said. The legal team also confirmed that no further public comments would be made outside formal legal channels.Because a minor is involved, Spanish law limits what can be shared publicly. Court hearings, rulings, and possible next steps remain confidential. At present, the police filing is regarded as a procedural step rather than as a final result.As Ilia Topuria’s fighting future draws attention, this situation continues quietly in the background, handled through lawyers and authorities rather than public arguments.Also Read: Khabib Nurmagomedov And Patimat Nurmagomedova Combined Net Worth In 2025: Undefeated UFC Career, Earnings, Private Love Story, Family And More",Giorgina Uzcategui reports online threats to Spanish police amid Ilia Topuria divorce.

Rashee Rice injury update: Will the Chiefs' wide receiver be back for Week 17 against the Broncos?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/rashee-rice-injury-update-will-the-chiefs-wide-receiver-be-back-for-week-17-against-the-broncos/articleshow/126143715.cms,"Image via IMAGN

Rashee Rice’s current injury status

What does it mean for Chiefs in Week 17?

Also Read:

As the Kansas City Chiefs prepare for a quick Week 17 turnaround, their injury problems are getting worse. Wide receiver Rashee Rice is now a big question mark ahead of the Christmas Day game against the Denver Broncos.Rice remains in the NFL’s concussion protocol after suffering a head injury in Week 15, forcing him to miss last weekend’s game and placing his availability for Thursday in serious doubt. According to the Chiefs’ initial injury report to start the week , Rice did not participate in practice on Monday. That development is not encouraging, especially given the compressed schedule. With Kansas City playing on Thursday, Rice has significantly less time than usual to progress through the league’s multi-step concussion protocol.To be cleared, Rice must return to full practice and receive approval from an independent neurologist. As of now, there is no confirmation that he has advanced to the later stages of the protocol, making his status for Week 17 uncertain at best.The timing could not be worse for Kansas City. Concussion recoveries are unpredictable, and even minor symptoms can delay clearance. With only two real practice days available before kickoff, Rice would need rapid improvement to have any chance of suiting up.If he is unable to practice fully by midweek, the likelihood of him playing against Denver drops significantly. The Chiefs have historically taken a cautious approach with head injuries, particularly when postseason stakes are no longer in play.Even if Rice does manage to return, the situation around him is far from ideal. Franchise quarterback Patrick Mahomes is already sidelined for the season after suffering a torn ACL, and backup Gardner Minshew is also unavailable following his own knee injury.That leaves Kansas City potentially turning to Chris Oladokun or recently signed Shane Buechele under center. Either option represents a major downgrade at quarterback, limiting the ceiling of all pass-catchers in the offense.If Rice can't play, the Chiefs will have to rely on a weak receiving corps against a disciplined Denver defense again. For Rice, the most important thing is still his long-term health, not rushing back into a season that is already out of postseason contention.Kansas City may decide to play it safe and give Rice more time to heal, looking ahead to 2026 instead of risking setbacks in a divisional game that takes place over a short week.As of now, Rashee Rice is likely to be questionable or doubtful for Week 17. It doesn't look like he'll be able to play against the Broncos unless he makes quick progress through the concussion protocol in the next 24 to 48 hours. A final decision is expected to be made closer to the start of the game, although both the player and the team may have to wait.","Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice did not participate in practice on Monday.

Why No. 17 stood out after the signing?

A contrasting moment for two franchises

Also Read:

The Kansas City Chiefs' season may be coming to an end in a tough way, but NFL fans have noticed a little, sweet moment. After quarterback Shane Buechele signed with the Kansas City Chiefs, his wife, Paige Buechele, posted a quiet tribute to Buffalo Bills player Josh Allen . This instantly led to a lot of talk on social media.Buechele was added to the Chiefs’ roster amid a quarterback crisis, with Kansas City already eliminated from playoff contention and battling a wave of injuries. While the signing itself flew under the radar, Paige Buechele’s Instagram post turned heads for an unexpected reason, the jersey number her husband will wear. Paige posted a photo of Shane Buechele wearing his Chiefs jersey with the caption , “And just like that we’re back to where it all began 🏈 let’s go 17!!!!” The choice of No. 17 immediately stood out. That number is famously worn by Josh Allen, the face of the Buffalo Bills and one of the league’s most recognizable quarterbacks.While Buechele has worn different numbers throughout his NFL journey, the decision to switch to Allen’s number appears to be a quiet nod to a close personal connection. Shane spent the past two seasons on Buffalo’s practice squad, where he worked closely with Allen in the quarterback room, often helping with film study and mechanics.The relationship between the two quarterbacks extends well beyond football. The Buecheles and Allens have been seen together at multiple off-field events, including holidays and weddings. Paige previously shared photos from Allen’s wedding, calling it “the most charming weekend celebrating the Allens,” highlighting the genuine bond between the families.That history adds emotional weight to the jersey choice. Rather than a flashy statement, Paige’s post reflected a sense of gratitude and respect for a chapter of their lives spent in Buffalo - and for a quarterback who helped shape her husband’s NFL path.The tribute takes place at a time of change for both teams. Kansas City is looking at its depth and finishing out a tough season after injuries and being eliminated from the playoffs. Buffalo, on the other hand, has already made the playoffs, and Allen is still in charge of the Bills even if he is dealing with some minor ailments.Shane Buechele is anticipated to be a backup for the Chiefs for the rest of the season. His status after the next two games is still up in the air, but the moment with his wife gave a rare look at the relationships that quietly determine NFL careers behind the scenes.In a league where contracts, stats, and weekly results are everything, Paige Buechele's simple tribute was a reminder that personal connections are just as important as what occurs on Sundays.","Shane Buechele was signed by the Kansas City Chiefs. His wife, Paige, posted a photo of her husband wearing his new number. The number is Josh Allen's, the face of the Buffalo Bills.

I feel like I got hip dropped, ankle got stuck in the grass or the turf, the cork turf, really weird field.”George Kittle added, “Tried to tape it up, went in in the third quarter, really got worse from there. If I can’t run very fast or plant I think it’s better to have other tight ends in there making plays.”For the unversed, the San Francisco 49ers star player, George Kittle, got his ankle caught in a turf as he was running the route, at the match against the Indianapolis Colts.As fans watched in horror, George Kittle looked visibly in pain as he limped to the sideline and stood there with his helmet on.A few minutes later, the San Francisco 49ers declared that George Kittle was questionable to return to the game as the team went on to win against the Indianapolis Colts.However, neither the team, the San Francisco 49ers nor the star player, George Kittle, has confirmed his potential return to the field.As the team gears up to face the Chicago Bears on Sunday night, fans remain pretty concerned about George Kittle’s return timeline.Also Read: Sherrone Moore's controversy deepens as disturbing details of release conditions raise eyebrows while Paige Shiver remains distant","George Kittle, the San Francisco 49ers star player, sustained a pretty brutal ankle injury in the third quarter at the recent match against the Indianapolis Colts.

Everything to know about Brittani, the woman keeping the Steelers QB grounded

For two decades, veteran QB Aaron Rodgers, 42, has lived under a microscope where every throw, feud, and relationship was pulled into public view. Fame followed him everywhere, often blurring the line between his professional brilliance and personal choices. Yet this offseason delivered a surprise no one saw coming. The Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback quietly arrived at training camp wearing a wedding ring, setting off whispers and questions that even seasoned reporters did not anticipate.Rodgers confirmed the news himself. He was married. Not in a splashy ceremony or magazine reveal, but in the most Rodgers way possible, calm and guarded. The identity of his wife stayed mostly out of reach, though one name surfaced quietly. Brittani. And in a career filled with noise, this silence spoke volumes.Aaron Rodgers has made it clear that this chapter of his life is different. Older, more reflective, and more intentional, he no longer treats his private world as public property. During Steelers training camp, he explained how marriage reshaped his outlook, both on and off the field.“When you meet the right one, and you’re with the right one, your whole world changes in a second,” Rodgers told NFL Network’s Kyle Brandt at Steelers training camp this summer.“To have that person who unconditionally loves you behind the scenes, there’s no better feeling. I’ve got the most incredible wife. I just really love her. I’m so thankful to have her by my side at the end. When you have that stability and rock behind you at the house, you feel like you can do anything. ”That sense of grounding did not appear overnight. Rodgers’ past relationships played out loudly. From Olivia Munn to Danica Patrick to Shailene Woodley, each connection carried attention, speculation, and eventually pain. Patrick later accused him of being “emotionally abusive.” Woodley reflected on their breakup with quiet sorrow, saying, “I haven’t shared much about my relationship with Aaron because it always makes me cry. It was not right. But it was beautiful.”Aaron Rodgers has not dodged accountability. In his 2024 Netflix documentary, he admitted, “I didn’t do myself any favors with some of the girls I dated after that that were in the public eye.”With Brittani, the approach changed. She avoids the spotlight entirely. Rodgers explained the reason plainly on “The Pat McAfee Show.” “It’s a sick society, isn’t it? I lived in the public eye for 20 years. I had a public relationship. How did that work out? Now I’m with somebody’s who private, who doesn’t want to be in the public eye, didn’t sign up to be a celebrity.”That privacy seems to have unlocked peace. Teammates see a calmer leader. Coaches see focus. Fans see a quarterback who looks settled at last. As Aaron Rodgers enters what could be his final NFL chapter, Brittani’s quiet presence may be the steady force that keeps his world balanced, even as the stadium lights burn brighter than ever.Also Read: Who is Josh Johnson, the Commanders’ emergency QB whose NFL resume includes stops with nearly half the league",Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers married his wife Brittani this summer.

Why Rohit Sharma got really emotional at a promotional event

England's managing director of men's cricket Rob Key has said the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) will investigate reports of excessive drinking by players during their mid-Ashes break, after videos circulating on social media raised fresh questions about the team's conduct on tour.England have already lost the Ashes after defeats in the first three Tests, allowing Australia to retain the urn in just 11 days of on-field action. Attention has now shifted off the field following the squad's stay in Noosa on Queensland's Sunshine Coast between the second and third Tests — a long-planned stop intended to help players relax during the gruelling tour.A video that emerged on Tuesday appeared to show opener Ben Duckett struggling to remember how to return to his hotel while speaking to members of the public. In the clip posted on X, Duckett is asked whether he knows how to get home, to which he appears to reply, “No,” before continuing the conversation in a disoriented manner. Another video showed batter Jacob Bethell dancing in a nightclub, though Bethell has not featured in the Test series so far.The ECB said in a brief statement that it was aware of the content circulating online but would not comment further until the facts were established.Speaking in Melbourne ahead of the fourth Test, Key said he would not tolerate over-indulgence if evidence emerged. “If there's things where people are saying that our players went out and drank excessively, then of course we'll be looking into that,” Key said. “Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol for an international cricket team is not something that I'd expect to see at any stage.”Key added that initial feedback suggested the players had behaved responsibly. “From everything that I've heard so far, they actually were pretty well behaved. Very well behaved. They sat down, had lunch, had dinner, didn't go out late… had the odd drink. I don't mind that. If it goes past that, then that's an issue.”Duckett's form has dipped sharply during the Ashes, managing a top score of 29 across six innings after arriving in Australia with strong credentials. Key also revealed he had previously looked into reports of players drinking on the eve of a one-day international in New Zealand, calling it a “wake-up call”.“I don't mind players having a glass of wine over dinner,” Key said. “Anything more than that, I think is ridiculous.”",England have already lost the Ashes after defeats in the first three Tests.

Leonard Gates’ Chewbacca mask prank fails to distract Nathan Aspinall



🎯 LIVE: Nathan Aspinall v Leonard Gates | 2026 World Darts Championship WATCHALONG

Nathan Aspinall experienced one of the strangest moments of his darts career before his second-round match at the World Darts Championship. The English star was left stunned in the practice room after being confronted by an opponent wearing a Star Wars Chewbacca mask. The bizarre incident happened just hours before Aspinall’s clash at Alexandra Palace. In typical darts fashion, the unusual moment quickly became one of the talking points of the tournament.Despite the scare, Aspinall showed no signs of nerves on stage. The world No.15 seed delivered a calm and dominant performance. He defeated American qualifier Leonard Gates 3-0 and dropped only three legs. The win secured him a place in the third round, where he will face Dutch player Kevin Doets after the Christmas break.After the match, Nathan Aspinall explained what happened in the practice room. “Have you heard what Leonard did in the practice room? He turned up, tapped me on the back and he had a Chewbucca mask. Honest to God, I can’t say it, I nearly pooed my pants, I was a bit scared.”Aspinall made it clear there were no hard feelings. “He’s a great guy. I played Leonard here last year. I had a job to do, I won 3-0, it was very comfortable and I’m back after Christmas.I’ve dropped one set in two matches. Played pretty average. I have tried to enjoy my game”, he added.He also praised the Ally Pally crowd and said, “Every time I’ve played here, the crowd gave me great support. I want to put a show on. It’s not that easy.”Looking ahead, Aspinall acknowledged the challenge posed by his next opponent. He noted that Kevin is a great player and he doesn't have a good record against him.Leonard Gates later confirmed the prank. Reflecting on the moment, he said, “We were in the players’ room and I was wearing my Chewbacca mask. I walked up to him and he was like, ‘Oh my God, what is this?’ So that’s a start. I’m going to peek around the corner with him and show, ‘Hey, I’m still here.’ No disrespect to Nathan, of course.”In the tournament, Gian van Veen has impressed with a 108.28 average, underlining his status as a strong contender in the tournament.Also Read: Michael van Gerwen fires shots at World Grand Prix 2025 winner Luke Littler ahead of World Darts Championship 2026 clash",Nathan Aspinall defeated American qualifier Leonard Gates 3-0 at the World Darts Championship.

Off-court ventures of Kevin Durant

Charlie McAvoy ’s honest take after jaw surgery and his impact on the Bruins after returning



Charlie McAvoy Says Bruins Are Angry And Annoyed | 32 Thoughts

Charlie McAvoy didn’t return to the Boston Bruins lineup with ease or comfort. He came back after weeks of pain, surgery, and frustration, stepping onto the ice on December 11 in Winnipeg knowing exactly what he had just pushed through to get there.This was the first time he had played in nearly a month. He skated with a protective bubble over his face, metal plates holding his jaw together, and the pressure of a full 60-minute game ahead. The injury happened in Montreal when a deflected slapshot struck his jaw, forcing him into surgery and a difficult recovery that was as draining mentally as it was physically.The reality after that night was difficult. Surgery followed, along with significant weight loss and constant discomfort because of an all-liquid diet. Even basic things like eating became a challenge. “It might be the most frustrating injury I’ve had,” McAvoy said. “You don’t think about how much your body needs real fuel until you don’t have it.”What carried him through wasn’t just determination. It was the people around him. McAvoy repeatedly credited his wife and family for keeping him grounded, sharing, “For me, it is always Kiley. She just gets me through everything.I really am so lucky to have her. And my family, too.That is my support system.”When he finally returned against the Winnipeg Jets, he didn’t ease in. He logged more than 24 minutes, picked up an assist, and helped Boston to a 6–3 win. Head coach Marco Sturm praised the performance, saying it reminded everyone “how much we actually missed him.”Since then, McAvoy has looked strong, blocking shots without hesitation, contributing offensively, and settling Boston’s defense with his usual calm presence. Even after everything, his mindset hasn’t shifted from gratitude. “Just grateful now to be on the other side, to be on track and getting healthy, and grateful for all the doctors,” he said.As the Bruins continue their push through the season, McAvoy’s comeback isn’t just a medical recovery story. It’s about resilience, support, and a player who refused to let adversity define him, and Boston is stronger because he’s back.Also Read: NHL updates: Heartbreaking week for Boston Bruins' Charlie McAvoy as his wife Kiley shares emotional family update","Charlie McAvoy returned to the Boston Bruins lineup on December 11.

Jaccob Slavin's upper-body injury update for the Carolina Hurricanes



The Carolina Hurricanes have confirmed that Jaccob Slavin is a defenseman who is out of action, on a week-to-week basis, with an upper-body injury. The disappointment is just a few months after he returns following a long lower-body injury that had cost him 29 games this season. The availability of Slavin is questionable because the team considers its defensive options before making further NHL games.Slavin was only recently back in the line with more than 18 minutes in his third game back. The team will play it safe so as to avoid more complications later, and it is not clear whether he will be put on injured reserve in the near future. His loss has created a vacuum in the Carolina defensive team, where his leadership and consistency in the field are crucial.The injury to Slavin is a major worry for the Carolina Hurricanes with the tight NHL schedule. A defensive-conscious and penalty-killing goalie, Slavin is extremely instrumental in stabilizing the back end of Carolina. His loss may compel the team to use more young defensemen or change the pairings in order to remain consistent.The Hurricanes are keeping a vigilant check on his progress, and no specific date has been given as to the time he can resume. Both fans and those who follow and analyze the NHL will be keen on the updates due to his availability, as this may determine the performance of the team in future games. The approach of Carolina emphasizes the necessity of harmonizing the short-term requirements of lineups and the health of players.Also Read: Net worth of Auston Matthews in 2025: Details on Toronto Maple Leafs captain's earnings, salary, and contracts",Carolina Hurricanes defenseman Jaccob Slavin is out on a week-to-week basis.

Ariel Helwani questions Andrew Tate’s confidence after Chase DeMoor defeat



Andrew Tate’s boxing loss to Chase DeMoor has triggered strong reactions across the combat sports world. The bout took place at Misfits Mania: The Fight Before Christmas in Dubai. Tate entered the six-round heavyweight contest with huge confidence. Many fans believed his kickboxing background would give him a clear edge. Instead, Tate struggled throughout the fight and lost by majority decision, leaving viewers surprised.The result quickly became a talking point. Tate is known for his bold personality and harsh criticism of other fighters. His poor show in the ring clashed sharply with that image. Soon after the fight, respected journalist Ariel Helwani shared his thoughts. He described the loss as a defining moment that exposed the gap between Tate’s words and his actual boxing ability.On a recent episode of The Ariel Helwani Show, Ariel Helwani gave a blunt assessment of the fight. He suggested that Andrew Tate’s defeat could be one of the clearest examples of a fighter being exposed. Drawing from years of debate among combat sports analysts, Helwani argued that the loss served as a harsh reality check.In his view, Tate’s carefully built “alpha male” persona collapsed once he was tested in the ring.Helwani pointed out that Tate often comments on and judges other fighters. That made the loss even more striking. According to him, the most revealing part came after the fight. He felt Tate struggled to accept what happened and tried to explain it away rather than own the performance.Helwani also dismissed Tate’s attempts to compare his fight to Jake Paul’s bout with Anthony Joshua. He made it clear that the situations were not similar at all. From his perspective, Tate should never have accepted the fight in the first place. He rejected the idea that Tate deserved praise simply for stepping into the ring.Helwani felt there was nothing heroic about the performance. He believed Tate was outmatched, looked uncomfortable, and failed to live up to his own hype. To him, framing the loss as a brave effort against a strong opponent missed the point entirely.Despite the criticism, Tate has refused to back down. He has claimed that he controlled the early rounds but ran out of energy later in the fight. He has pointed to fatigue and physical factors as reasons for the loss.Still, the debate around his boxing future continues to grow. Fans and analysts are now questioning whether Tate belongs in the ring at all.Also Read: Andrew Tate’s brother Tristan Tate claims the boxer earned $52 million from misfits mania despite shocking defeat against Chase DeMoor",Ariel Helwani questions Andrew Tate’s confidence after Chase DeMoor defeat.

Stephen Curry on Steve Kerr and Draymond Green’s heated exchange



Stephen Curry’s reaction was silent yet impactful



The struggling Golden State Warriors should have been celebrating their dominant 120-106 victory over the Orlando Magic this week, but the post-game chatter didn’t revolve around Steph Curry’s shooting or the team’s defensive surge. Instead, the spotlight shifted toward an internal friction on the bench. The heated exchange with head coach Steve Kerr and Draymond Green seems much bigger than the Warriors' blowout win. And not everyone is happy about this.For Stephen Curry, who represents the Warriors franchise, the sight wasn’t a comfortable one. Curry isn’t usually annoyed, but post this friction between his coach and teammate, his body language spoke volumes. The constant sideline theatrics are wearing down the NBA superstar. The Warriors are not exactly crushing this season, and with each ongoing match, the “frustrating” is bubbling. The dream of another championship is not supported by the talent on the bench, and that gap is bringing in some unwanted imagery for the fans.The Warriors hosted the Magic at the Chase Centre on Monday night. With the home court advantage, the Warriors delivered an outstanding performance, winning by 120-106, but it wasn’t the win that led the talks.During a timeout in the third quarter, tension arose on the sidelines when Steven Kerr and Draymond Green exchanged some heated words, followed by Green walking off straight towards the locker room.When asked about the nature of the conversation with Draymond Green, Steve Kerr replied, “We got into it, obviously. I took the timeout because I thought we lost our focus there a little bit. So, we had it out a little bit, and he made his decision to go back to the locker room to cool off.""Despite everything, Kerr knows the value Draymond adds to the roster, “We need Draymond. He's a champion. We've been together for a long time. ... Yeah, it's unfortunate what happened, but it happened.""When Stephen Curry was asked about his view on the Kerr and Green friction, he just replied with, “They are just having a good conversation. It’s kind of for them to talk about, not me.”Continuing about if Warriors' 15-15 season, a record long shot away from what was expected, was the point of contention between everyone, Curry said, “Yeah, but that frustration has led to two wins. It's unfortunate that we're up here, considering where we've been, two-game win streak and protecting our home court, that the vibes of the questions are a little bit more negative than they should be. I get why you're asking them, but downstairs right now, the DJ's got a good playlist going, guys are getting their work in, and we're having a good time because we're winning. ""Stephen Curry was sitting beside Draymond Green when the entire scene unfolded, yet he remained seated with no intention to interfere. He was sitting in silence while shaking his head. The four-time champion, for years, has acted like a connecting dot between everyone on the Warriors roster, but this stance might suggest that even the league’s most patient leader is feeling the weight of the recurring drama.The Warriors have long thrived on Draymond’s chaos on the court and Kerr’s calm demeanor even in panic moments, but this particular flare-up felt different. It was definitely not a good sight for the Dub nation. With the Warriors eyeing another playoff seat, these internal disagreements will remain their biggest hurdle before anything else.Also read: Who are Buddy Hield’s parents?

Joel Embiid’s Injury Report vs Brooklyn Nets (December 23, 2025)

Joel Embiid's season-long knee plan

What his presence changes tonight for the Philadelphia 76ers

What to check before tip-off

The Philadelphia 76ers are preparing for their December 23, 2025 regular-season game against the Brooklyn Nets with their biggest question largely answered. Joel Embiid is listed as probable on the latest injury report and is expected to play, barring any issues during pregame warmups.His listing is tied to routine knee management, not a new injury. That distinction matters. Throughout the season, the Sixers have been clear when Embiid was not going to play. When his knees flared up earlier, the team did not hesitate to rule him out. This time, the staff believes he is in good enough condition to be on the floor.A probable designation is as close to a green light as Philadelphia usually gives Joel Embiid before tip-off. The team has used “out” and “doubtful” tags in similar matchups earlier in the season, including past meetings with Brooklyn. The shift back to probable suggests confidence in how his body has responded over the past few days.Final confirmation will come later tonight, as it always does with Embiid. Still, unless something changes during warmups, the expectation is that he plays.Joel Embiid’s 2025-26 season has been shaped by careful management.He missed time earlier due to issues in both knees and has rarely played on consecutive nights. The goal has been simple: keep him available without pushing through unnecessary strain.When he has been on the court, his impact has been steady. He continues to score efficiently, draw fouls, and protect the rim. His minutes have sometimes been lower than in past seasons, but his role has not changed. Philadelphia still runs through him when games matter.If Embiid is active, the Philadelphia 76ers can play the way they prefer. They can slow the game, attack the paint, and force Brooklyn to deal with him inside. The two-man action with Tyrese Maxey remains central, creating space when defenses collapse and pressure when they stay home.Brooklyn’s options are familiar. Single coverage risks foul trouble. Double teams leave shooters open. Philadelphia will likely manage Embiid’s minutes but make sure he is on the floor during key stretches.Three things matter before the game starts: the final injury report, how Embiid moves during warmups, and whether there is any mention of a minutes limit. Those details usually tell the real story.For now, everything points toward Embiid playing against the Nets. As always, how much he gives depends on how his knees respond once the game begins.","Joel Embiid is listed as probable on the latest injury report and is expected to play, barring any issues during pregame warmups.

The flip side is: The ‘super apps,’ which are very popular in China, are not popular in the same way outside of China, and I think they’re turning into a Chinese super app. And that may or may not work outside of China.

Godfather of AI Yoshua Bengio’s career advice





Godfather of AI Yoshua Bengio recently admitted that the moment he truly started worrying about artificial intelligence (AI) was not decades into the future, but in 2023 after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Bengio appeared on The Diary Of A CEO podcast hosted by Steven Bartlett where he was asked why an introverted scientist was suddenly stepping into the public eye to talk about AI risks. To this, the Turing Award–winning “Godfather of AI” replied saying “Because I have to. Because since ChatGPT came out, I realized that we were on a dangerous path and I needed to speak.” He continued: “I needed to raise awareness about what could happen, but also to give hope that there are some paths that we could choose in order to mitigate those catastrophic risks.”“What was it about ChatGPT that caused your mind to change?,” the host asked. Bengio replied saying that before ChatGPT, “most my colleagues and myself thought it would take many more decades before we would have machines that actually understand language.”Explaining further, the AI scientist continued: “Alan Turing, founder of the field in 1950, thought that once we have machines that understand language, we might be doomed because they would be as intelligent as us.He wasn’t quite right. So we have machines now that understand language, but they lag in other ways, like planning.”Stating that the AI bots are not a real threat for now, Yoshua Bengio reiterated “but they could be in a few years or a decade or two.”“So it is that realization that we were building something that could become potentially a competitor to humans or that could be giving huge power to whoever controls it and destabilizing our world, threatening our democracy. So all of these scenarios suddenly came to me in the early weeks of 2023, and I realized that I had to do something, everything I could about it,” he said.When asked about jobs getting replaced by AI and career advice for the future generation, Bengio advised to “Work on the beautiful human being that you can become. I think that that part of ourselves will persist even if machines can do most of the jobs"".Continuing further, Bengio said “there will be jobs where we want to have people. If I’m in a hospital, I want a human being to hold my hand while I’m anxious or in pain. The human touch is going to, I think, take more and more value as the other skills become more and more automated.”","Yoshua Bengio, the Godfather of AI, spoke on The Diary Of A CEO podcast.

No chill for NBA stars during Christmas, and Stephen Curry is no exception. Of course, Christmas and basketball have always been linked. Long before sold-out arenas and national broadcasts, the holiday meant sitting in front of a television and watching the league’s biggest stars perform. That childhood habit eventually became his own responsibility, placing him on the same stage he once admired.Now in his 13th straight season of Golden State playing on Christmas, Curry views the moment with perspective. When asked to reflect on his holiday memories, Curry made a candid admission about his holiday games over the years.Stephen Curry understands what a Christmas Day assignment represents within the league and for the fans.""It's a blessing because you understand being one of the 10 teams that play means you're marketable,"" Curry told ESPN. ""The experience of playing in the game is fun. ... Before the in-season tournament, that was the NBA's biggest moment before the turn of the calendar year. Definitely felt like a different energy around it.""Despite the prestige, Curry’s personal performances took time to catch up with the occasion.His early Christmas outings were challenging. Over his first eight appearances, shooting struggles followed him onto the holiday stage.""I don't have a favorite,"" Curry said. ""I have traditionally not played great on Christmas Day, so bringing up great memories.""Still, Curry’s presence on Christmas has evolved. As his career progressed, efficiency improved and comfort followed.Stephen Curry keeps finding new ways to make basketball feel fun. Curry turned into a playful dance after making three against the Orlando Magic at Chase Center.At 37, Curry has earned the freedom to be himself on the floor. He has stretched his own record for career three-pointers. The Warriors lean into that energy, especially after a tight 119-116 win over the Suns.

Poll What is the biggest challenge facing the U-19 team development? Lack of coaching clarity Selection issues Player readiness for international cricket

NEW DELHI: With the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) planning to review the U-19 team's performance in the recent U-19 Asia Cup, the focus is likely to fall on the Centre of Excellence's (CoE) overall role in player development.TOI understands that concerns have been raised about the process of grooming players over the last four years. It is learnt that the board may have to work on getting the Indian team management, selectors and the CoE back in sync.Sources said there seems to be a lack of clarity on the roles of the CoE coaching staff and the selectors. VVS Laxman has recently got a two-year extension as the head of cricket at the CoE and may have to rework his involvement in the process of coaching.“There is some confusion about role definition. Laxman is firmly in charge of making decisions about U-19 teams. He even has a major say in appointing captains. When Rahul Dravid was head of cricket, he was actively involved in the selection of India ‘A' players because he was the one who was devising programmes for each player. At the moment, Laxman doesn't have much say in the India ‘A' process,” a BCCI source said.Besides the big loss to Pakistan in the U-19 Asia Cup, the India ‘A' team failed to make the final of the Rising Stars Asia Cup last month.The major concern of team management is that the players who are coming through the ranks are not close to finished products ready for the international level. Very few players successfully graduate to senior cricket from the age-group level.With the CoE beginning operations this year, Laxman, it is understood, is currently consumed by administrative work. The coaching staff at the CoE is going through a major overhaul. Fast bowling coach Troy Cooley's role has also been under the scanner, with very few pacers showing much improvement in skills. The board is set to relieve him of his duties on the premise that he is turning 60.Incidentally, Laxman, unlike Dravid, doesn't travel much with the developmental teams. “Most of Laxman's overseas assignments have been with second string Indian teams when the main team is away on Test assignments. It needs to be seen if he can travel more with the developmental teams,” the source said.Recently, Jitesh Sharma was sent for the Rising Stars Asia Cup as captain on the insistence of the senior selection committee. However, Jitesh had a major say in playing combinations and strategies in the tournament, which is not a norm with developmental sides. These calls are taken by the coaching staff in consultation with the selectors.",Concerns have been raised about the process of grooming players over the last four years.

Collin Gillespie finally opens up on on-court altercation with Draymond Green

What did Draymond Green say to Collin Gillespie?

The Phoenix Suns guard Collin Gillespie finally breaks the silence on his on-court altercation with Draymond Green. On December 21, 2025, the Golden State Warriors were up against the Phoenix Suns. During the second quarter of the game, Green seemingly pushed the Suns guard while tracking back on defense. This led to an on-court argument between the athletes, leading to a second technical foul for Green, resulting in his ejection.Gillespie, while the Suns were preparing for their game against the Los Angeles Lakers, opened up about this argument. The young athlete stated that he was clueless as to what might have triggered Green to react that way. Gillespie clearly believes that he did not do anything that might have triggered the Warriors’ forward.On December 23, right before the Phoenix Suns went on the court to face the Los Angeles Lakers, Collin Gillespie opened up about the confrontation with Draymond Green. Talking to the media, the young athlete stated, “I ain't even get under his skin. Like, he said something to me and I said something back to him and I don't know if he I thought I wasn't going to respond to what he said to me?” Gillespie further explained, “I'm 26 years old, I'm a grown man.I'm not going to just let somebody call me a name and then not say anything back. I didn't really get under his skin.”Gillespie ended his part of the story saying, “I just said what he said back to me and that was it and then he freaked out so I don't really know."" Green was visibly furious and lashed out at the young athlete. After Green got ejected due to his behavior, head coach Steve Kerr tried to protest the decision. This led to the coach getting a technical foul as well.When Gillespie was asked about the reason for the ejection, he stated, “I think he was more mad at the ref, and that’s why he got his second tech. I didn’t really have a problem with how he hit me, or when he ran into me, or what he said to me. But that’s just basketball at the end of the day.”It was a highly intense game between the Golden State Warriors and the Phoenix Suns. Just minutes into the second quarter of the game, Draymond Green seemingly pushed the Suns guard Collin Gillespie. While this led to his first technical foul in the game, the fact that the athlete continued to argue with the Suns guard gave him his second technical foul. During the argument, Green addressed Gillespie, saying, “WHITE BOY! B***! DON’T PULL THAT S***, WHITE BOY!”When Gillespie was asked about the kind of language Green used, the young athlete was hesitant to use the words in front of the media. As per the interview, Gillespie’s exact statement was, “I can’t say. You could probably put it together, but I can’t say it in the media. I just said, ‘Don’t talk to me like that.’ That’s all I said. It wasn’t crazy, and I used the terminology he used.”","The Phoenix Suns guard Collin Gillespie finally breaks the silence on his on- court altercation with Draymond Green.

Why Rohit Sharma got really emotional at a promotional event

WATCH:

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma 's return to domestic cricket was meant to be low-key — a training session, some quiet preparation and a walk back to the dressing room. Instead, his first Vijay Hazare Trophy outing in Jaipur delivered a reminder of the frenzy that still follows one of India's biggest sporting icons.On Tuesday, a video surfaced showing Rohit being hounded by fans for selfies after finishing his net session at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium.As the Mumbai batter walked towards the dressing-room corridor, a group of supporters crowded around him, jostling for space and attempting to get close for photographs. The situation escalated when one fan behaved inappropriately and nearly breached the players' restricted area, forcing security personnel to intervene.Rohit appeared visibly irritated but chose not to engage with the crowd.He continued walking as officials quickly moved in, ushering fans away from the corridor and shutting the passage doors to prevent further intrusion. The clip soon went viral, sparking fresh debate around fan entitlement and the thin line between admiration and intrusion.The episode comes at a time when star appearances in domestic cricket are drawing unusual attention. Rohit is in Jaipur as Mumbai begin their Vijay Hazare Trophy campaign in Elite Group C, starting with matches against Sikkim on December 24 and Uttarakhand on December 26.His presence alone has transformed a typically low-profile domestic fixture into a high-security event.Organisers in Jaipur have already anticipated a sharp spike in attendance, with thousands expected to turn up largely to watch Rohit in action.With the former Indian captain now playing only one international format, his domestic outings are also being closely tracked as part of his preparation between international assignments.The Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA), mindful of recent crowd-control challenges at the venue, has stepped up security arrangements. “We have arranged comprehensive police security as well as private bouncers.
