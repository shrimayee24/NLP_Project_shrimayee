NEW DELHI: Indian skipper Harmanpreet Kaur 's experience helped secure a six-wicket victory for India against Pakistan in the Women's T20 World Cup, keeping their semi-final hopes alive on Sunday. Chasing a modest target of 106 runs, India struggled but managed to clinch the win thanks to Harmanpreet's 24-ball 29-run innings. She retired hurt with two runs needed to win, and Sajana Sajeevan, on her debut, sealed the victory with a boundary.Opener Shafali Verma (32 off 35 balls) and No.3 Jemimah Rodrigues (23 off 28 balls) adopted a cautious approach, affecting India's Net Run Rate (NRR) negatively.India's current NRR stands at -1.217, below Pakistan's -0.555. To keep semi-final hopes alive, India must win against Australia and Sri Lanka by significant margins.The Indian innings included only five boundaries, and the top three batters struggled to accelerate. With Smriti Mandhana out early, Shafali and Jemimah focused on singles.The heat impacted the running between the wickets, with easy doubles and triples left unattempted. Shafali's fitness issues and Jemimah's reliance on timing over power added pressure on the batting unit.Harmanpreet took charge after the dismissal of Jemimah and Richa Ghosh off consecutive deliveries by Fatima.Earlier, Indian bowlers contained Pakistan to 105 for 8. Renuka Singh Thakur (1/23) and Arundhati Reddy (3/19) maintained discipline in their line and length. Off-spinners Deepti Sharma (1/24) and Shreyanka Patil (2/12) focused on varying their pace.Leg-spinner Asha Sobhana (1/24) took the wicket of Pakistan skipper Fatima, thanks to a sharp catch by Richa Ghosh.India restricted Pakistan to 29 for 2 in the powerplay. Nida Dar's 28 runs provided some resistance but were insufficient to post a challenging total. Indian bowlers delivered 58 dot balls, reflecting their control over the game.India now needs to capitalize on this win and maintain momentum in their upcoming matches to advance to the semi-finals.","India beat Pakistan by six wickets to keep semi-final hopes alive.

"""Forever in debt"": Travis Kelce Once Talked About The Meaningful Reason Behind Him Wearing No. 87 Chiefs Jersey",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/forever-in-debt-travis-kelce-once-talked-about-the-meaningful-reason-behind-him-wearing-no-87-chiefs-jersey/articleshow/114040231.cms,"Credit: Getty Images

The Emotional Story Behind Travis Kelce Wearing No. 87: A Heartfelt Tribute to Brother Jason



Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has reached a pivotal moment in his career as he heads towards his fourth Super Bowl appearance with the team. His exceptional skills have propelled him to the forefront of the league, earning him a spot in four Super Bowl appearances. Off the field, his personal life has also garnered significant attention, particularly his high-profile relationship with singer Taylor Swift.After Swift attended one of Kelce’s games, his No. 87 jersey saw an extraordinary sales spike, with reports indicating a 400% surge. However, the significance of the number 87 goes far beyond fanfare and popularity—its roots are deeply personal for the younger Kelce.Also Read: “How do you simulate the crowd noise”: Bill Belichick's Humorous Jab at the Colts for Faking Crowd Enthusiasm In an unforgettable moment of NFL history, Travis and his brother Jason Kelce made headlines last year when they became the first siblings to face off in a Super Bowl. This rare occurrence catapulted them to unprecedented fame, not just for their athletic prowess but also for their heartwarming bond, which they regularly showcase on their highly-rated podcast. Their supportive family and Travis’s relationship with Swift have only further solidified their place in the spotlight. Yet, both players remain celebrated for their immense talent, as evidenced by their continued recognition as Pro Bowl selections.Beneath this fame, however, lies a touching story of brotherly support that shaped Travis Kelce’s career. During his college years at the University of Cincinnati, Travis found himself at a crossroads after being suspended from the football team for violating team rules. In what could have derailed his career, it was Jason’s unwavering support that helped steer him back on course. Jason spoke with coaches on his younger brother’s behalf, convincing them to give Travis a second chance. In a moment of reflection, Travis referred to his older brother as his ""lifeline"" during this tumultuous time.Travis further elaborated on the symbolic meaning behind his jersey number in an interview with NFL Films, revealing that his decision to wear No. 87 was not coincidental. “If there is a Kelce legacy, two brothers making it to the NFL, it all started in 1987 because this big guy was born in 1987,” he explained while sitting beside Jason, who dons the No. 62 jersey. Travis’s choice of No. 87 serves as a tribute to his brother’s birth year and the lasting impact Jason has had on his life and career.The tight end’s gratitude toward his older brother is deeply felt, with Travis stating, ""You're the only reason why I wear 87 anyways. You started the legacy."" His admiration for Jason is also evident in his acknowledgment that he owes his entire career to him. “I’m forever in debt to this guy for putting his name, our name – the Kelce name – on the line,” Travis said, emphasizing just how much his brother’s intervention meant.Now, as both brothers continue to cement their legacies in the NFL, with potential Hall of Fame careers in sight, the Kelce brothers’ story serves as a reminder of the power of family, support, and perseverance. Their journey—marked by brotherly love and mutual respect—resonates with fans, both on and off the field.Also Read: After missing birthday party, Taylor Swift attends Travis Kelce's game on Monday Night Football, squashing all breakup rumors",Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has reached a pivotal moment in his career as he heads towards his fourth Super Bowl appearance with the team.

NEW DELHI: India's wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson is again aiming for a permanent spot in the Indian cricket team , despite making his international debut nine years ago in 2015. With the retirements of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma from the shortest-format of the game, the new leadership - head coach Gautam Gambhir and T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav- has decided to experiment with Samson as an opener in the T20I series against Bangladesh.In the first match of the series at the New Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Stadium in Gwalior, Samson opened the innings with Abhishek Sharma . Samson, displaying his timing and technique, scored 29 runs off 19 balls but did not make a large impact as he was dismissed early.Former Indian opener Aakash Chopra emphasized the need for consistency in upcoming matches, warning that Samson could be dropped if he does not perform well.""He is good. He scored 29 runs. My only thing was that since he had reached here, he should go slightly further ahead. He should score a few more runs because, otherwise, they would drop him. He keeps moving in and out (of the side), and up and down (the batting order),"" Chopra said on his YouTube channel.Chopra praised Samson’s elegance in his shot-making during the match in Gwalior. He stated, ""You need to talk about Sanju Samson. Abhishek Sharma was playing amazingly well until he got run out, but how well did Sanju play? Gautam Gambhir said long back that if Sanju Samson doesn't play for India, it's India's loss. He was made to open. The silken touch was seen. He wasn't hitting the ball hard; it seemed like he didn't want to hurt the ball, and he was hitting one four after another.""The 29-year-old Samson's performance in the remaining matches of the series will be crucial for his future with the Indian T20I team .","India's wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson is again aiming for a permanent spot in the Indian cricket team.

'Conditions different from our expectations'

DUBAI: India vice-captain Smriti Mandhana on Tuesday said skipper Harmanpreet Kaur will be leading the side against Sri Lanka in the Women's T20 World Cup , having got retired hurt in the previous game due to discomfort in her neck.Harmanpreet had walked off the field when she was batting on 29 against Pakistan on Sunday. India won that game by six wickets but still face early elimination from the tournament following the loss to New Zealand in their opener.""She (Harman) is doing fine and she will be fine for tomorrow,"" Mandhana told reporters.However, there is no clarity over the fitness status of all-rounder Pooja Vastrakar who missed the Pakistan game.""Pooja, I think the medical team is still working on her. So, the update will come only tomorrow during the match. But yeah, I don't think I can say anything at the moment,"" said Mandhana.Mandhana, the best batter in the side, has failed to get going thus far on the slow wickets of the UAE where stroke making has proved to be extremely tough.India face Sri Lanka on Wednesday, a team that stunned them in the Asia Cup final not so long ago. They are yet to play Australia and their hopes of making the semifinals hang by a thread.India chased down 106 in 18.5 overs against Pakistan, mindful of the run rate factor in the business end of the tournament.""It (run rate) definitely was last match, but as I said, the conditions are a lot different to what you expect as a batter so you are probably thinking to get that run rate high and also you firstly you have to win the match first that's the first priority for us,"" said Mandhana.""So, it's a balance between trying to find out what's the best for the team. Of course, you know in the last match I couldn't like I started off fine but then later on I consumed a few dot balls which was a little irritating for me...""...but yeah having said that as batters we have to be really smart we can't we can't just go out there thinking that oh we are going to take on this bowling lineup and we are just going to cruise because of course the conditions and the outfield is a lot different,"" she said.Mandhana said conditions in the tournament have been different from their expectations when asked about Harmanpreet going back to number four against Pakistan after batting at three against New Zealand.""Definitely the wicket condition, the ground conditions are a lot different to what we thought when we came here. That also is a big consideration (in deciding batter order),"" she said.""The conditions, I don't see any except the New Zealand match, we haven't seen any team go over 140 in the whole tournament, 135-140, be it a day game or a night game, says a lot about the conditions,"" she added.","Harmanpreet Kaur will lead India against Sri Lanka in Women's T20 World Cup.

Sinner-Shelton rematch

SHANGHAI: Second seed Alexander Zverev scraped through to the last 16 of the Shanghai Masters on Tuesday, winning two tiebreaks against the Netherlands' Tallon Griekspoor in an ill-tempered match that ended 7-6 (8/6), 2-6, 7-6 (7/5). Novak Djokovic meanwhile powered through the third round, steamrolling Italian Flavio Cobolli 6-1, 6-2 in just over an hour.Zverev's first set against 40th-ranked Griekspoor was overshadowed by the German's prolonged, expletive-laden exchange with the umpire when he disagreed with a call.""I cannot be bothered to go to China in October, for you to screw up this... I cannot, this is not possible,"" Zverev ranted before tossing his racket across the court.The world number three claimed the first set, but proceeded to fall apart in the second, with the Dutchman breaking him in the first, third and fifth game.Zverev squandered an early lead in the third set tiebreak but an unforced error on Griekspoor's part saw him crowned winner.""Every time I play him it's the most difficult match,"" said Zverev, saying there had been ""not much difference"" between them.In contrast, Djokovic, a four-time Shanghai champion, completely dominated 30th-ranked Cobolli, breaking him in the second and sixth games of the first set.""I can't complain about anything in the game, I was able to play aggressively,"" Djokovic said.""I'm glad to be progressing through a tournament that has meant a lot to me in my career.""Fans waved Serbian flags and screamed in delight when the former world number one wrote part of his Chinese character name on a camera lens at the end of the match.Djokovic will next play Russian Roman Safiullin , who upset Frances Tiafoe in three tight sets.The end of that match also saw the American swear repeatedly at the umpire.The last 16 has finally fallen into place after days of schedule disruption due to rain.Ben Shelton dispatched Spain's Roberto Carballes Baena 6-3, 6-4 to set up a Shanghai rematch with world number one Jannik Sinner of Italy.The American knocked Sinner out of the tournament at the same stage last year.""(I have) great memories from that match last year, I probably watched the tape of that a couple times so far this year... I'm really looking forward to it, that will be fun,"" Shelton said.Sinner's chief rival Carlos Alcaraz , who beat him in the China Open final last week, will face veteran Gael Monfils.The 38-year-old Frenchman defeated his younger and higher-ranked compatriot Ugo Humbert 7-6 (9/7), 2-6, 6-1.Stefanos Tsitsipas recovered from a lapse in concentration in the second set to beat France's Alexandre Muller 6-3, 7-5.The 26-year-old will meet world number five Daniil Medvedev in the next round.""(Medvedev) likes courts like this.

India's path to the semifinals complicated by Australia's win

Scenarios for India's progression

If India secure two convincing wins, they will accumulate six points. However, if New Zealand also win their remaining matches — against Pakistan and Sri Lanka — and Australia defeat Pakistan, all three teams (India, New Zealand, and Australia) will end up with six points each. In this scenario, NRR will decide which two teams advance to the semifinals from Group A.

Pakistan also remain in the race for a semifinal spot. They currently hold second place and need to beat both Australia and New Zealand to finish on six points. If Pakistan win both matches and India also beat Australia and Sri Lanka, then India and Pakistan will qualify for the semifinals.

If Australia win all their remaining matches, there could be another scenario of India, Pakistan and New Zealand finishing on four points each. Then NRR will decide the second spot in the group. With India already behind the other two contenders in terms of NRR, they will need a huge victory over Sri Lanka on Tuesday to be ready for such a scenario ahead.

NEW DELHI: Defending champions Australia delivered a commanding performance, defeating New Zealand by 60 runs to climb to the top of Group A in the ICC Women's T20 World Cup , held in the UAE. On Tuesday, Australia set a challenging target of 149 runs, before dismissing New Zealand for just 88 in 19.2 overs.With this comprehensive victory, Australia now have four points from two matches and lead the group with an impressive net run rate (NRR) of +2.524.The loss dropped New Zealand from the top spot to third place in the standings.India's qualification to the semifinals has become more challenging after the Australia vs New Zealand match. But the heavy defeat substantially decreased New Zealand's NRR, giving India an opportunity to catch up with a one-sided victory in their next match.Currently, India sit in fourth place in Group A with two points from two games, the same as Pakistan (now second) and New Zealand, but trail behind due to an inferior NRR. India's NRR of -1.217 is significantly lower than Pakistan's +0.555 and New Zealand's -0.050.To advance to the semifinals, India must win both of their remaining matches — against Sri Lanka on Wednesday and Australia on Sunday — by substantial margins. Improving their NRR is crucial to surpass their rivals and finish in the top two.So, India's chances hinge on not just winning their matches but doing so decisively to boost their NRR above their competitors, starting from today's match against their Asian rivals Sri Lanka.",India's path to the semifinals complicated by Australia's win.

SKY's new-look Team India will look to seal series vs Bangladesh today

NEW DELHI: It's a rarity for an India captain to turn up for an optional training sessions on the eve of an international game. Suryakumar Yadav did so on Tuesday afternoon, ahead of the second T20I against Bangladesh at the Arun Jaitley Stadium. His happy-go-lucky reputation precedes him but it is now evident Surya is emerging as a capable leader since being appointed T20I captain in July.Surya himself went through an intense batting session for over half an hour. He then sat with Abhishek Sharma and Jitesh Sharma next to the nets and had a lengthy chat about international cricket and the importance of not being predictable. Sources said the gist of the talk was that to survive at this level, one has to keep evolving and trying new things to stay ahead of the opposition.It appears Suryakumar is now warming up to the direction the T20I team must take. The presence of many fresh faces means there's a definite path laid out. This team has been specifically picked keeping the T20 World Cup in 2026 in mind. Head coach Gautam Gambhir and chief selector Ajit Agarkar too were involved in lengthy chats with the likes of Varun Chakravarthy, Harshit Rana and Sanju Samson The preparation for India's title defence has already begun. Speed sensationMayank Yadav , for example, has been told to focus more on T20s than the longer formats. Selectors have identified him as a potential trump card for the next T20 World Cup. This series, followed by the four T20Is in South Africa next month, will be a sort of audition.The plan is to create format-specific player pools, say those in the know. For the shortest format, it's about investing in players who are doing well in the IPL. The endeavour is to rid the players of confusion. There will be more players who are not seen as all-format prospects.Surya is now a statesman in T20 cricket and he has been given the clear mandate of building this team for the next T20 World Cup. This Bangladesh team may well be lacking in T20 abilities, but the Indian team management is looking for markers to judge its own players.Going by the emphatic win in the first T20I, there are going to be more players pushing the seniors in times to come.","Suryakumar Yadav is emerging as a capable leader since being appointed T20I captain in July.

Among the pre-tournament favourites, Harmanpreet Kaur and Co's performance has been below par. Heading into their third match, coach Amol Muzumdar and his support team will be working overtime to correct course.India endured a mixed start, losing the opener to New Zealand by 58 runs and then managing to get past Pakistan with an unconvincing six-wicket win, which put them in a spot of bother. On Wednesday, they will take on Group A's bottom-placed Sri Lanka looking to shore up their net run rate (-1.217).The good news for Team India is that skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, who had hurt her neck in the game against Pakistan, is fit for the clash against Sri Lanka. ""She (Harman) is doing fine and she will be fine for tomorrow,"" vice-captain Smriti Mandhana told reporters. Pooja Vastrakar , who missed the previous game due to a niggle, is uncertain for the game.The side's biggest concern, however, is the poor show of the batting unit. The explosive openers have failed to make an impact so far.Shafali Varma has struggled against spin, scoring just two against New Zealand and labouring to 32 against Pakistan.Similarly, Mandhana has had a disappointing start, with scores of 12 and 7 respectively. The team's Powerplay scores of 43/3 against New Zealand and 25/1 against Pakistan have been dismal as well.The onus will be on Mandhana to take the lead against Sri Lanka's spin-heavy attack. Although her record against Sri Lanka is not impressive, with only 379 runs from 19 innings, including two half-centuries, she must provide the team with a solid start in this crucial league match. The bowlers too are yet to come into their own.India boast a dominant 19/5 record against Sri Lanka but one of those defeats came recently in the Asia Cup final in July. While the desire for revenge can be a powerful motivator, it's important to note that unlike Sri Lanka, the Indian team hasn't played a match since then.The World Cup is not a tournament that allows for dress rehearsals and a loss to Sri Lanka could potentially end India's campaign, especially considering their upcoming match against formidable Australia.Sri Lanka, having suffered losses against Pakistan and Australia, will be eager to secure their first points. The Chamari Athapaththu-led side will look to capitalize on India's vulnerabilities and make a strong comeback.","India's T20 World Cup campaign has not got off to an ideal start.

NEW DELHI: Veteran New Zealand batter Kane Williamson will miss the start of the three-Test series against India due to a groin strain suffered during the second Test against Sri Lanka in Galle. The injury requires a period of rehabilitation, delaying Williamson's departure to India.New Zealand selector Sam Wells confirmed the news, stating that the decision to rest and rehabilitate Williamson was made to avoid further aggravating the injury.""The advice we've received is that the best course of action is for Kane to rest and rehabilitate now rather than risk worsening the injury,"" Wells explained. ""We remain hopeful that if his recovery goes to plan, Kane will be available for the latter part of the tour.""In Williamson's absence, uncapped batter Mark Chapman has been called up as cover.

NEW DELHI Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya played a key role in India’s victory in the first T20I against Bangladesh in Gwalior. Pandya remained unbeaten, scoring 39 runs off 16 balls. He also bowled his quota of four overs, returning figures of 1/26.Former India fast bowler RP Singh , however, advised not to judge Pandya’s form based solely on this match. ""Using a performance against Bangladesh to judge a player's form is not right,"" Singh said in his role as an expert for Jio Cinema and Sports 18.He pointed out that Bangladesh is not currently playing at their best.Singh acknowledged Pandya's capabilities but suggested that stronger opponents would be a better measure of his form. ""Hardik did well; he is capable of doing things like that. But using a performance against this team as a criterion, in my opinion, is not right. Do that maybe against a better team or in a better competition,"" he added.Pandya’s notable performance came in the 12th over when he hit a ramp shot for a boundary followed by another boundary and then a six off consecutive balls from Taskin Ahmed . Singh noted that Bangladesh’s lack of pressure didn’t allow for a true assessment of Pandya’s form. ""Bangladesh did not create a situation where he had to make a match or finish it,"" Singh explained.RP Singh also mentioned Pandya’s improvement in bowling his full quota of overs, addressing earlier concerns about his fitness. ""What is good to see is that Hardik Pandya is bowling four overs. There was always a question as to whether he can bowl his full quota or not, but he is doing that well now. His batting was always good, where he has improved is in his bowling and fitness,"" Singh said. However, Singh urged caution, noting that tougher tests are ahead.

How the result helps Team India

The six-time Women's T20 World Cup champions Australia triumphed over their neighbours New Zealand in every aspect of the game on Tuesday, securing a dominant 60-run victory that solidified their position at the top of Group A.Australia 's top order laid the foundation for this win with an aggressive batting performance after winning the toss. Alyssa Healy (26 off 20), Beth Mooney (40 off 32), Ellyse Perry (30 off 24), and Phoebe Litchfield (18 off 18) all contributed significantly, setting New Zealand a target of 149 runs to chase in Sharjah.New Zealand struggled throughout their innings, ultimately succumbing to a stellar bowling display from the defending champions. Megan Schutt delivered exceptional figures of 3/3 from 3.2 overs, while Sophie Molineux (2/15) and Annabel Sutherland (3/21) also shone with the ball.The defeat could have been even more pronounced had it not been for Melie Kerr, who made a notable impact with her inspired fielding, taking 4/26 and executing an outstanding catch. She also top-scored for her team with 29 runs.During the contest, Schutt made history by bowling Georgia Plimmer for 4 in the third over, becoming the leading wicket-taker in Women’s T20 World Cup history.The nature of this result could significantly influence the final standings in Group A, as New Zealand faced a considerable setback in their net run rate (-0.050).Australia have two wins in two matches and could effectively seal their place in the semi-finals with victory over Pakistan next up.It is now up to three teams - Pakistan, New Zealand and India - to fill the other spot from the group. India had been in a poor place after their defeat to New Zealand and a laboured win over Pakistan. But with White Ferns not just dropping points but doing so in a one-sided affair, it opens the door for India and Pakistan.India’s loss to New Zealand had put them in a precarious position immediately, although they secured points with a victory over Pakistan.To enhance their chances, Harmanpreet Kaur-led India will likely need at least one more win, possibly two, and a favourable shift in net run rate.","Australia beat New Zealand by 60 runs in ICC Women's T20 World Cup 2024 match in Sharjah.

But it was Pakistan who took a 2-0 lead in the first 20 minutes with Butt and Muhammad Nadeem scoring. Jugraj scored India's first goal through a penalty corner four minutes later, but Mudassar Ali restored the two-goal cushion for Pakistan by making it 3-1.(Screen Grab: FIH)India got another penalty corner just before half-time, and Jugraj once again cut Pakistan's lead to one goal with his second strike.The teams went in at half-time with Pakistan leading 3-2.Drag-flick legend Sohail Abbas got on the scoresheet in the 42nd minute by finding the net on a penalty corner to make it 4-2.With 28 minutes left on the clock, India needed a goal to stay in the match and put pressure back on Pakistan.

Brief scores:

CHENNAI: In 2017, when Damandeep Singh decided to move to Canada to join his family, he gave his son Harvansh Singh a choice - relocate with him and build a career in Canadian cricket or stay back in India to chase his dream. Without hesitation, Harvansh chose to remain in India, driven by passion to represent the country at the highest level.Today, that bold decision seems rewarded a s Harvansh, representing the Indian U-19 side, scored a remarkable century (117, 143b; 7x4, 6x6) in the second Youth Test against Australia U-19 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Tuesday.His century powered India's innings to a strong 492 before Australia skipper Oliver Peake (62 batting, 113b; 8x4, 1x6) showed his skills to revive his team after an early jolt and finish the day at 142-3.Upon reaching the milestone, Harvansh couldn't hold back his excitement. He let out a huge roar, turned to his father in the stands and offered him a bow - a gesture to the sacrifices they had made together. Then the 17-year-old wicketkeeper-batter from Gandhidham went on to do a thigh-five.Damandeep, a truck driver in Canada, was beaming with joy and was holding the Indian flag throughout.Speaking to TOI, he said: ""It's our family's dream to play for the country, unfortunately, we (my brothers and I) couldn't do it. So, we are proud of him (Harvansh). Our neighbours, relatives, all of them tell him that 'you are fulfilling our dreams'. Even his younger sister is learning cricket; she is also a wicketkeeper.""Harvansh walked onto the field on Tuesday with an overnight score of seven alongside captain Soham Patwardhan (61, 124b; 6x4). While the skipper fell to an inswinger from Oliver Patterson in the third over of the day, Harvansh adopted a bold template and adeptly tackled both spinners and pacers, using a variety of shots to keep the visitors at bay.He was toying with the Australian bowlers, by smartly cutting, pulling and driving the ball with much élan. A huge fan of Yuvraj Singh , Harvansh hit six sixes, most of them over the mid-wicket and long-on region, reminiscent of his idol.Harvansh kept losing partners at the other end but quietly went about his business. He later shared a 90-run partnership with Anmoljeet Singh for the last wicket, before Riley Kingsell dismissed him.

The right-arm pacer Yadav made an impressive debut for India in the opening T20 against Bangladesh in Gwalior.Mayank, who has played just one first-class game, has been fast-tracked into the national side considering his special talent.While Singh is impressed with Mayank's pace and control, he feels it would be too early for someone like him to be part of the five Test series in Australia.""For Australia tour, Akash Deep should be in the pace bowling attack. His bowling style suits better. Mayank Yadav has pace, which is one aspect of fast bowling,"" Singh said in an interaction arranged by JioCinema.""There are many variations and skills that develop slowly.

NEW DELHI: After Mayank Yadav took 1-21 on his T20I debut at Gwalior, former India left-arm pacer RP Singh believes the tearaway pacer fulfilled the criteria for which he was selected in the series against Bangladesh and hopes to witness more impactful performances from him.One of the main attractions in India’s ongoing T20I series against Bangladesh was how Mayank would fare.In IPL 2024, Mayank left a lasting impression on everyone by going for speeds above 150kmph, while showing flawless precision in his lines and lengths.He won the Player-of-the-Match award in his first two games for Lucknow Super Giants , but an abdominal strain soon sidelined him. Mayank then spent time at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru to recover and become match-fit by bowling eight to ten overs every day.During his debut against Bangladesh in Gwalior, he bowled a maiden over and claimed his first international wicket in Mahmudullah. Wednesday’s second T20I between India and Bangladesh at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi will mark the grand homecoming of Mayank, a product of the iconic Sonnet Club.“When Mayank bowled a maiden in his first over of international cricket, it showed he had an idea about his accuracy, which he monitored well, and how important it was along with pace. In the first match, there are a lot of butterflies, ifs, and buts, questions in the mind of a debutant.”“So, I didn’t expect that he would have a very high performance. The purpose for which he was picked for this series, he ticked off that criteria. He first bowled with pace and then showed some accuracy in the first match. But there is still a lot to be improved upon, in terms of performances and creating a lot of impact. Overall, his first match performance was decent, according to me,” said Singh, an expert with JioCinema & Sports18, to IANS in a virtual interaction.The availability of Mohammed Shami for the all-important Border-Gavaskar Trophy is still uncertain, and Singh is of the opinion that Akash Deep will be the next preferred fast-bowling option for India, while also citing Mayank’s need to gain more experience in playing red-ball cricket domestically.“Aakash Deep is a better choice for the Test series in Australia. His bowling style suits him better for the seam-up deliveries in Australia. Mayank has pace, and one aspect of pace bowling is that it should be fast. There are many variations and skills that he needs to develop slowly.”“Right now, Mayank is in the developing phase. There is a lot of bowling load in a Test match. Plus, there is a need for a lot of skills and patience in playing the longer format. But for that, there is still time. There is still time for him to play domestic cricket, which Aakash Deep and Mohammad Shami have played a lot.”Left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh ’s performance, where he took 3-14 and struck twice in Power-play, helped India secure a seven-wicket victory in Gwalior. Singh believes it will take more time for Arshdeep to play Test cricket in the future, citing his skills being more proficient in white-ball games.“I still feel that there is not much difference in the areas of red-ball and white-ball bowling in the death overs. If the number of variations increases in white-ball cricket, then your patience increases in red-ball cricket. Arshdeep has the skill and can move the ball both ways. He has variations that are more suitable for a shorter white-ball format. I can see a little more time to be taken in him playing Test cricket.”“It is not that he has any shortcomings. His pace is good, he has variations, and his lengths are good. But despite that, the feeling that he gives is that he is an ideal bowler for white-ball games. He is a left-arm pacer and gets wickets all the time. So I feel that his focus should be on white-ball cricket for a year and a half, and after that, Arshdeep may play Test cricket.”The absence of Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rishabh Pant, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, and Jasprit Bumrah from the T20I series means the Suryakumar Yadav-led side has a lot of fresh faces.Additionally, a significant number of these young players offer all-round skills, which Singh thinks is a conscious strategy by the Indian team to establish a larger pool of candidates for defending the T20 World Cup title on home turf in 2026.“The aspect of developing a pool of players with an eye for the 2026 T20 World Cup title defence is very much visible here. With head coach Gautam Gambhir and skipper Suryakumar Yadav at the helm, one can really see they are forming a bench of players, who did well in the IPL and had impactful performances in the domestic circuit.”“When you see players like Riyan Parag and Abhishek Sharma there, one gets to understand that they are creating players to fill the gaps and ensure a smooth transition in the shortest format after the senior players have left. I believe they are on the right track to achieve it.”“I really believe that the captain, coaches and selectors must have made a four-year plan of drafting more all-rounders into the Indian team in the shortest format. Like, impact player rule exists only in the IPL, while there is no such ruling in international cricket.”“Whereas in international cricket, the Indian team needs tons of all-round options. More all-rounders in the Indian set-up means the team balance becomes better and the effort for making that happen is going well at the moment,” signed off Singh.",Mayank Yadav took 1-21 on his T20I debut against Bangladesh.

NEW DELHI: Barcelona legend Andrés Iniesta officially announced his retirement from professional football on October 7, 2024, marking the end of a truly remarkable career that spanned over two decades.The 40-year-old midfielder leaves behind a legacy filled with iconic moments, both at the club and international levels, cementing his status as one of the greatest footballers of all time.From leading Barcelona to domestic and European glory to inspiring Spain’s ""golden generation"", Iniesta’s career was defined by his elegance, creativity, and unshakable composure on the field.Here are the top five moments that define his extraordinary career:Iniesta’s crowning moment came on July 11, 2010, when he scored the winning goal in the FIFA World Cup final against the Netherlands. In the 116th minute of extra time, Iniesta latched onto a pass from Cesc Fàbregas, kept his calm, and fired the ball past Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg.This goal secured Spain’s first-ever World Cup trophy, etching Iniesta’s name in football history. His iconic celebration, removing his shirt to reveal a tribute to his late friend Dani Jarque, added an emotional depth to the unforgettable moment.Barcelona’s path to the 2009 UEFA Champions League final seemed all but over in the dying moments of the semi-final against Chelsea. Trailing 1-0 on the night, and with a mountain to climb, Iniesta delivered a stunning last-minute equalizer from outside the box, sending Barcelona through on away goals.That goal, a perfect example of his big-game mentality, paved the way for Barcelona’s treble-winning season and their eventual Champions League triumph against Manchester United Iniesta’s partnership with Lionel Messi was one of the most prolific and celebrated in football history, and their chemistry was on full display in the 2015 Champions League final.Iniesta orchestrated Barcelona's attack from midfield and delivered a pinpoint assist for Ivan Rakitić’s opening goal just minutes into the game against Juventus.Barcelona went on to win 3-1, securing their fifth Champions League title and Iniesta’s fourth.Iniesta was often at his best in the most intense matches, and none come bigger than El Clásico. In November 2015, Barcelona demolished Real Madrid 4-0 at the Santiago Bernabéu, and Iniesta was the heart of it all.He scored a thunderous goal and provided a masterclass in midfield control, with even Madrid fans giving him a standing ovation. His performance that night remains one of the finest displays ever seen in football's fiercest rivalry.In May 2018, Iniesta bid an emotional farewell to Barcelona after 22 years with the club. His final appearance at Camp Nou, a 1-0 victory over Real Sociedad, was a tearful moment for both the player and the fans.As he left the pitch, the entire stadium rose to applaud the departing legend, and his teammates formed a guard of honour. The image of Iniesta sitting alone on the field after the game, soaking in the atmosphere, is etched into the memories of Barcelona fans worldwide.Lionel Messi, one of Iniesta’s closest friends and long-time teammates, paid a heartfelt tribute to the retiring legend.Messi said, “One of the team-mates with the most magic and of the one's I enjoyed playing together the most. Andres Iniesta, the ball will miss you and so will we! I wish you the best, always. You are a phenomenon.”","Andrés Iniesta announced his retirement from professional football on October 7, 2024.

Messi pays tribute

Barcelona legend Andres Iniesta announced his retirement from professional football on Monday (7 October), putting an end to his more than two-decade-long career. The Spaniard confirmed the news on social media after hinting at the decision last week saying, ""COMING SOON 8/10/24"". He wore the numbers 8 and 24 during his 18-year tenure with the Spanish club.In an illustrious club career, Iniesta made 674 appearances for Barcelona, in which he scored 57 goals and provided 135 assists, during which he won four Champions Leagues, three FIFA Club World Cups, nine League tiles, three European Super Cups, six Copa del Reys and seven Spanish Super Cups.Iniesta was equal lethal for the Spanish national team as he was one of the pillars of a historic La Roja side that is dubbed as the country's golden generation.Iniesta scored a goal in extra-time of the 2010 World Cup Final against the Netherlands, which led Spain to their first and only FIFA World Cup trophy. He was also in the side that lifted the 2012 UEFA European Championships.The 40-year-old midfielder recently attended an event in Spain where he hinted that his future may lie in coaching as he hopes to return to the club where he became a legend.Since leaving Camp Nou in the summer of 2018, Iniesta embarked on spells withVissel Kobe and Emirates Club. Lionel Messi paid tribute to his former teammate Iniesta as his fellow World Cup winner heads into retirement at the age of 40.Eight-time Ballon d’Or winner Messi has responded to that news by saying in a post of his own: “One of the team-mates with the most magic and of the one's I enjoyed playing together the most. Andres Iniesta, the ball will miss you and so will we! I wish you the best, always.

KOLKATA: Beginning its journey with eight teams 11 summers ago, Indian Super League (ISL) has gradually expanded to 13 teams over these seasons.After being left out of the country's new top-tier ahead of the erstwhile premier division I-League, Kolkata giants Mohun Bagan and East Bengal were included into ISL at the start of the 2019-20 season. Then, honouring the AFC-AIFF envisaged future roadmap for Indian football, I-League champions Punjab FC were promoted to ISL last season.Keeping up with the promise, Kolkata giants Mohammedan Sporting Club - as the current I-League winners - were also added to the lot before the start of the ongoing 2024-25 season. However, despite being the country's highest level of competitive football, ISL is yet to achieve the desired level of fan following among the supporters of the participating clubs.However, Bhaichung Bhutia , the former India captain and one of the few legends to play the game in the country, believes that Mohammedan SC 's presence will add to the intensity of the Kolkata derbies , which in turn will make Indian football more exciting for the fans. The Sikkimese Sniper – as Bhutia was famously known in his playing days, also hopes that the huge fan-bases that come along with the teams like MSC will result in a wider popularity of ISL.""It's great for teams with a huge fan base such as Mohammedan SC to come into the ISL. I have always advocated for Mohun Bagan, East Bengal, and Mohammedan SC for coming into the ISL, because these are the teams that have huge passionate fans across India. To make the ISL competitive and interesting, you need those derbies and passionate fans to be there,"" Bhutia said in an exclusive interview shared with TOI.With talismanic India skipper and striker Sunil Chhetri hanging up his boots four months ago, Bhutia had a straightforward message for the youngsters who are shouldering the responsibilities of the Indian team under the stewardship of new head coach Manolo Marquez.""You need to be consistent with the national team. You need to start delivering, and it's teamwork. Obviously, you will have great coaches, but as a player there should be consistency in performances, and you need to keep working hard,"" Bhutia added.Asked to pick his favourite teams for the season, Bhutia said, ""It's difficult to predict the favourites for the title. Mohun Bagan (Super Giant) have put in a lot of budget to make a great team. Mumbai City FC, who didn't have a great Durand Cup, are a team that will always have a good side. FC Goa have been consistent throughout the years. I think these are the few teams that are going to be favourites for this season.""Over the years, ISL has moved on from its novelty factor as global stars - well past their prime - have stopped coming to India to join a developing league for a season or two. But Bhutia personally still loves to go down the lane when asked about his memorable moments from the league.""My best memory of the ISL will always be the first year, with some of the greatest footballers around the world coming and playing for us. In the first season, you had players like (Alessandro) Del Piero, Nicolas Anelka, Robert Pires, and a lot of big stars playing with our own local players!"" he said before signing off.",Bhaichung Bhutia believes Mohammedan SC will add to the intensity of the Kolkata derbies. The Sikkimese Sniper also hopes that the huge fan-bases that come along with the teams like MSC will result in a wider popularity of ISL. The former India captain also has a straightforward message for the youngsters.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114019332,imgsize-766534,width-400,resizemode-4/114019332.jpg"

Tennis, a sport steeped in history and tradition, has produced some of the most remarkable athletes and extraordinary feats. While numerous records have been set and broken over the years, a few stand out as nearly unbeatable due to the sheer dominance and consistency required to achieve them.Here are the top five near-unbeatable records in tennis history that might never be surpassed.Rafael Nadal's dominance on the clay courts of Roland Garros is a story of unrivaled excellence. Nadal has clinched the French Open title an astounding 14 times, making it the most titles ever won by a single player at one Grand Slam tournament. Known as the ""King of Clay,"" Nadal's mastery of the surface is unmatched, as he has shown both skill and stamina year after year.Wimbledon, the oldest and most prestigious tennis tournament, has seen countless legends, but none quite like Martina Navratilova. Between 1978 and 1990, Navratilova secured nine singles titles at Wimbledon, the most by any player, male or female, in history. Her dominance on grass courts was unparalleled, and her ability to adapt and evolve her game over 12 years ensured her place as the queen of Wimbledon.In 1988, Steffi Graf accomplished a feat that no other player, male or female, has ever replicated: the Calendar Golden Slam. That year, she won all four Grand Slam titles (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open) and capped it off with a gold medal at the Seoul Olympics. This achievement, known as the ""Calendar Golden Slam,"" remains a singular milestone in tennis history.Roger Federer's 237 consecutive weeks at world No. 1 is one of the most impressive records in tennis. From February 2004 to August 2008, Federer held onto the top spot for nearly five years, a period of unparalleled consistency and dominance. No other player, past or present, has managed to maintain such a stranglehold on the No. 1 ranking for such an extended time.Margaret Court’s record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles remains the highest tally in tennis history for 50 years, till Novak Djokovic matched it in 2023. Achieved between 1960 and 1973, Court dominated across all surfaces, winning multiple titles at each Grand Slam event. Her versatility and consistent excellence set a benchmark that has proven incredibly difficult for subsequent generations to match.Novak Djokovic’s achievement of winning 24 Grand Slam singles titles is a monumental feat in tennis history. Spanning from his first title at the Australian Open in 2008 to his most recent at the 2023 US Open, Djokovic has consistently dominated across all surfaces and venues. His record not only cements his status as one of the greatest players in tennis but also highlights his unmatched adaptability and resilience over nearly two decades.",Roger Federer's 237 consecutive weeks at world No. 1 is one of the most impressive records in tennis. Rafael Nadal has clinched the French Open title an astounding 14 times. Steffi Graf won all four Grand Slam titles in 1988. Margaret Court's 24 Grand Slam singles titles remains the highest tally in tennis history for 50 years.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114039463,imgsize-57604,width-400,resizemode-4/114039463.jpg"

Show Glimpses Of Potential

Maaya steadily climbs ladder

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu has always been a powerhouse of Indian tennis , producing legendary players who have left a lasting impact. The father-son duo of Ramanathan and Ramesh Krishnan, along with the legendary Amritraj brothers led by Vijay, have produced some of India's greatest tennis moments.It's quite a legacy to live up to and now there are two more talented teenagers from the state who seem to have the promise to keep the flag flying.Rethin Pranav and Maaya Revathi have been the talk of the city tennis circuit over last week during the course of the Fenesta National Championships in New Delhi.While 17-year-old Rethin won the men's singles title, Maaya, all of 15, fell short in the title round after a brilliant run through the week.The National Championships title was not the only high for Rethin. The Chennai boy had a good start to the season, reaching the top-100 in the world junior rankings. He then went on to play in his maiden Grand Slam at the US Open juniors . Although he lost in the second qualifying round, it was a moment to cherish for him.""This was a good season as I got to compete in the US Open. The level of play was good and I had to adapt physically and mentally. I trained under Somdev Devvarman for two weeks in India and had learnt a lot from him. He helped me improve my stroke play and footwork and I could feel the changes in my game style. He is a good mentor on and off the court,"" Rethin told TOI.Apart from competing in the US Open juniors, Rethin spent time in New York watching top players in action. ""I got to watch the match between Taylor Fritz and Casper Ruud and it was an amazing experience. The speed of the match was very high and you do not get to see this everywhere. A few learnings were the body language that they maintained throughout the match and the way they both fought back after losing a point,"" Rethin said.With the new season is not far away, Rethin is slowly looking to transition to the senior level and compete in ITF tournaments .Like Rethin, Maaya had a memorable run this season as she competed in her first Grand Slam at the Australian Open juniors. She also went on to attain her career-best rank of 135 and was one of the two Indian players to receive Grand Slam Grants.""Participating in the Grand Slam was different as the level of competition was high and I got to know the level of tennis. This taught me where I have to work on to get better. I got a lot of exposure by playing against different players across all conditions in the ITF junior competitions. I got to know a lot of people on the tennis circuit and learnt something from each one of them,"" Maaya said.Maaya, who looks up to Serena Williams , has been training under coach Manoj Kumar for the past four years in Coimbatore. Her aim is to compete in all the Grand Slams next year. ""I will be participating in higher grade (J200 and higher) junior tournaments in the upcoming months and will slowly look to play in the senior category.""As they continue to climb the ladder, there is a sense of anticipation about their potential and it's on the duo to keep it going.","Rethin Pranav and Maaya Revathi have been the talk of the city tennis circuit. Rethin won the men's singles title at the Fenesta National Championships in New Delhi. Maaya, all of 15, fell short in the title round after a brilliant run through the week.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114039684,imgsize-112150,width-400,resizemode-4/114039684.jpg"
