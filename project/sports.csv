The quiet strength of humility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-quiet-strength-of-humility/articleshow/119985268.cms,"

Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

A disquieting transformation can be seen unfolding before us if we observe the glittering talk shows, blockbuster films, the viral social media clips - humility's quiet retreat. In its place, aggressiveness, vanity, and pride reign supreme. Somehow, humility has been misinterpreted as self-deprecation rather than self-awareness.

As C S Lewis, the renowned British author and Anglican theologian, clarified: ""Humility is not thinking less of yourself. It's thinking of yourself less.""

I wish I had the power to change the tone of the narrative that humility is weakness, forgiveness is cowardice, and snobbery, a form of strength.

Throughout human history , spiritual traditions have exalted humility as the supreme quality that illuminates one's inner journey toward divine connection.

There is a striking commonality among the various demons In Hindu mythology—whether Mahishasur, Surapadma, Hiranyaksha, or Ravana—their inflated self-importance. These characters are dominated by 'Ahankara' or super-ego, which swells until they demand universal submission. When the world refuses to bow, they unleash torment upon humanity, necessitating their ultimate destruction by divine avatars.

The Bible echoes this sentiment: ""God resists the proud, but he gives grace to the humble"" while the Quran teaches that the servants of the Most Merciful are those who walk upon the earth humbly.

Donald Grey Barnhouse, a famous preacher, once visited a beach incognito to escape adulation. He met a young girl playing alone who told him that her parents allowed her seaside playtime while they read scriptures at home.

After their pleasant interaction, Barnhouse said: ""When you go home, Mary, tell your mother that you were playing with Donald Grey Barnhouse. She will be elated.""

Mary reflected briefly before responding: ""When you go home, Donald, tell your mother that you were playing with Mary. She will be elated too.""

The priest later described this exchange as the most humbling moment of his life.

Einstein once declined the honour of being Israel's prime minister in 1952, while cricketer Rahul Dravid declined an honorary doctorate from Bangalore University, saying he had worked hard at cricket but haven't studied enough to deserve this honour.

These luminaries remind us that humility isn't diminishment—it's expansion. We shrink through unyielding arrogance but grow through humble attempts at self-effacement. The world's strangest paradox may be this: to truly grow, one must become small.

In one of his couplets, Valluvar brings up this paradox, where he declares that modest people tower even more than the colossal mountains.

""Nilayin Thiriyaadhu Adangiyaan Thotram

Malayinum Maanap Peridhu""

The steadfast, self-controlled, humble humans stand aloft,

Taller than the mightiest mountain.

I wondered what made the saint compare humans with great mountains. Symbols of permanence in countless literary and spiritual traditions, mountains stand in silent judgment of our transience. Gazing at their majestic forms, one wonders: Do they look down upon the fleeting human drama with cosmic amusement?

Trey Lance finds fresh start with Chargers in backup role behind Justin Herbert



In a move that may redefine the Los Angeles Chargers ' quarterback depth, Trey Lance has signed a one-year deal worth up to $6.2 million, per ESPN’s Adam Schefter. The 24-year-old quarterback joins Taylor Heinicke as the primary backups behind franchise cornerstone Justin Herbert , adding another intriguing chapter to Lance's NFL journey.Despite Justin Herbert's reputation as one of the league’s toughest signal-callers, his 2024 season was far from smooth. Though he didn’t miss a game, Herbert fought through a litany of injuries—from a plantar fascia issue in training camp to an aggravated high ankle sprain, a thigh bruise, and a fractured index finger that ultimately ended his season in Week 14. While his toughness is unquestioned, the Chargers clearly felt the need to bolster their quarterback room with reliable insurance.Trey Lance provides that cushion—albeit still largely unproven. Once considered a future franchise quarterback, the No. 3 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft has had an unpredictable ride through the league. Limited to just four starts in two seasons with the San Francisco 49ers, Lance compiled a 2-2 record, throwing for 797 yards, five touchdowns, and three interceptions. A devastating ankle injury early in his 2022 campaign opened the door for Brock Purdy, whose unexpected rise eventually made Lance expendable.In 2023, the Dallas Cowboys picked him up in exchange for a fourth-round pick. However, Lance never saw the field that season. His real chance came in 2024, when he started the season finale against Washington, completing 20 of 34 passes for 244 yards and rushing for another 26 in a 23-19 loss. That performance, though not statistically explosive, showed flashes of his dual-threat potential and poise under center.Interestingly, Lance is younger than both Bo Nix and Michael Penix Jr.—two quarterbacks selected in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft. His youth, combined with raw athleticism and untapped upside, continues to make him a valuable developmental piece.“He just needed to continue to gain experience,” former Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy had stated, pointing to Lance's limited college exposure—only 19 games at North Dakota State—before being thrown into the NFL spotlight.Lance's arrival likely signals the end of Easton Stick’s tenure in Los Angeles, with the Chargers now locked into a more experienced and dynamic QB trio. While Herbert remains the unquestioned starter, the franchise is clearly planning for every scenario. Should Herbert’s health falter again, Lance may finally get the meaningful reps he’s long awaited.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers’ quiet stance reportedly signals a shift away from Pittsburgh Steelers toward Minnesota Vikings In LA, Trey Lance isn’t being asked to be the savior—but he may still write a redemption story.","Trey Lance has signed a one-year deal with the Los Angeles Chargers worth up to $6.2 million.

Aaron Rodgers' NFL future hangs in the balance – And the Steelers may be left waiting



Wild Steelers Trade, Aaron Rodgers Decision | AST Call-In Show

As the NFL offseason rolls forward and the 2025 Draft looms closer, one name continues to dominate headlines—Aaron Rodgers. Despite his decorated career and four MVP awards, Rodgers remains unsigned, and all eyes are on what has become one of the league’s most compelling storylines. Among the teams reportedly most invested in his future are the Pittsburgh Steelers, who appear all-in on the 41-year-old quarterback. But with every day that passes, hope in Pittsburgh may be giving way to uncertainty.The Steelers, who lost both Russell Wilson and Justin Fields in free agency, have cleared the deck in their quarterback room—placing their faith firmly in Aaron Rodgers. Currently, only Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson remain on the roster, neither seen as a long-term solution. With the Steelers clearly banking on Rodgers to stabilize their offense, any hesitation from his camp could be detrimental.Owner and president Art Rooney II recently admitted, “We keep getting positive sort of signals about it. So yeah, I’d say we feel pretty good about it at this point.” Still, even he hinted that patience won’t be endless, stating Rodgers has “not forever, but a little while longer” to decide.But behind the scenes, conflicting opinions are surfacing. According to Pro Football Talk's Mike Florio, one “high-level” NFL executive offered a different take on Rodgers’ true intentions: “The opinion is he doesn’t really want to play for the Steelers, and he’s waiting for Minnesota.” Florio clarified, “It’s not a fact; it’s not a report. But it’s somebody who is in the ecosystem and isn’t a low-level employee.”This speculation adds a new twist. While the Minnesota Vikings had previously expressed interest, they appear to have committed to second-year quarterback J.J. McCarthy. Yet, the possibility remains that Rodgers is hoping for a last-minute opening in Minnesota’s quarterback room—leaving Pittsburgh as more of a fallback than a preferred destination.Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin , known for his calm demeanor, is reportedly giving Rodgers space and not imposing any hard deadlines. When asked about whether a deadline had been set, Tomlin responded, “Not to my knowledge. I don’t know that we’ve approached it from a deadline perspective.” Still, the absence of urgency doesn’t eliminate the pressure mounting within the organization.Interestingly, Rodgers had already visited the Steelers’ facility back in March and even held a throwing session with newly acquired wide receiver DK Metcalf. That interaction was viewed by many as a promising sign, one that suggested Rodgers was seriously weighing the move. But weeks later, no decision has been made—and silence often speaks volumes in the NFL.At 41, Rodgers holds all the cards. He can afford to wait, watch, and choose his next destination carefully—or even walk away from the game altogether. While retirement hasn’t been publicly discussed as a likely option, it still lingers in the realm of possibilities.Also Read: Could the Giants really draft both Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders in 2025? Mel Kiper Jr. believes so For Pittsburgh, the stakes are high. A missed opportunity with Rodgers could leave them scrambling with limited quarterback options and a fanbase left wondering what could have been.

Contract negotiations between Vladimir Guerrero and the Blue Jays

Ramifications of the flopped negotiations

Toronto Blue Jays' ace first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. has been making headlines after his chase for a fat contract. Known for his stellar on-field performance, Vladimir Guerrero is looking for a deal that reflects his importance to the team. The latest newcomer has revealed that his $500 million contract deal has run into some problems.The Blue Jays and Vladimir Guerrero's negotiations are still on, with the two sides declaring they are keen to agree on a mutually profitable contract. Despite Vladimir Guerrero stating that he needs a long-term contract, the negotiations have been tough. Vladimir Guerrero was quoted as wanting a contract equivalent to Juan Soto's 15-year deal but no more than $600 million. However, the Blue Jays have been reluctant to agree to these terms, and this has created a big void between the two teams.Meanwhile, Vladimir Guerrero and the Blue Jays agreed to a one-year, $28.5 million arbitration deal to settle his arbitration case for the 2025 season. The deal puts Vladimir Guerrero at the highest salary earned by an arbitration-eligible player in MLB history. But the reason Vladimir Guerrero's contract is not being extended is that he becomes a free agent after the 2025 season, and that puts pressure on negotiations.This historic arbitration deal reflects Vladimir Guerrero's immense value to the team and the expectations tied to his performance in the upcoming season. However, it also raises questions about the Blue Jays’ long-term plans and whether they’re willing to meet the financial demands and expectations required to retain a superstar of his caliber. With free agency looming, every game in 2025 will not only influence Guerrero’s market value but also determine if Toronto can remain his baseball home beyond this pivotal season.Not being able to sign Vladimir Guerrero to a long-term contract has some implications for Vladimir Guerrero and the Blue Jays. For Vladimir Guerrero, not having an extension while approaching free agency is both a plus and a minus. While he may be pursued by other clubs interested in signing him with huge contracts, there is uncertainty regarding his next move. His suitors included the New York Yankees, New York Mets, and Boston Red Sox, who made their names featured on news headlines following the remarkable work by Vladimir Guerrero.As the season in 2025 approaches, Vladimir Guerrero and the Blue Jays will be under some difficult choices on these issues. Vladimir Guerrero's on-field play will influence his value to the marketplace, and the Blue Jays will have to consider the benefits of holding onto their best asset versus the financial expense that accompanies it. The outcome of these talks will be watched carefully by fans and analysts alike because it can make or break Vladimir Guerrero's career and the destiny of the Blue Jays.Ultimately, the decision is for the management of the Blue Jays to make. They have to decide whether they see Vladimir Guerrero Jr. as a long-term cornerstone of their franchise or if they are willing to risk losing him to a rival team. With his talent and marketability, Guerrero’s future contract will be one of the biggest storylines in MLB history, shaping not only his career but also the competitive landscape of the entire league.Also Read: Vladimir Guerrero Jr. Net Worth 2025: Salary, Contract, Charity, Personal Life, And More","Toronto Blue Jays' ace first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. has revealed that his $500 million contract deal has run into some problems.

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants edged past Mumbai Indians by 12 runs in a thrilling IPL 2025 clash at the Ekana Stadium on Friday, registering their second win of the season. The victory lifted LSG to sixth place on the points table, while MI slipped to seventh after their third loss in four matches.Despite a career-best 5/36 from MI skipper Hardik Pandya and a valiant 67 off 43 balls by Suryakumar Yadav, MI fell short in their chase of 204, finishing at 191/5.LSG rode on a blazing start from Mitchell Marsh (60 off 31) and Aiden Markram (53 off 38) to post 203/8. Pandya’s late strikes, including wickets of Markram, Pant, and Miller, restricted further damage.MI’s reply started poorly as openers Will Jacks and Ryan Rickelton departed early. Suryakumar and Naman Dhir (46 off 24) revived the chase with a 69-run partnership. However, Dhir’s dismissal by Digvesh Rathi – who repeated his now-controversial “letter-writing” celebration – shifted momentum.Suryakumar kept MI in the hunt but fell in the 17th over to Avesh Khan, triggering a slowdown. With 22 needed off the final over, Pandya’s lone six wasn’t enough as MI stumbled in the final moments.Earlier, LSG’s opening duo had powered them to 69/0 in the powerplay, before MI pulled things back with timely breakthroughs, including a strong spell from Pandya.

Dean Wells’ two-year cancer battle reflected his unbreakable spirit and quiet leadership



This one truly stings. Dean Wells , the dependable linebacker who spent nearly a decade giving his all to the Seahawks and Panthers, has passed away at just 54. After a two-year battle with cancer, Wells died on April 3, 2025, surrounded by his loved ones. He may have worn a helmet and pads, but those who knew him say his real strength came from within. He wasn’t the flashiest guy on the field—but if you were paying attention, you’d always find #95 doing the dirty work, showing up when it mattered most.Even after the lights dimmed on his NFL career , Wells never lost that trademark grit. When he was diagnosed with cancer two years ago, he didn’t back down. Instead, he fought it with the same tenacity and heart he brought to every play.His wife, Lisa, and their two sons were by his side every step of the way. They witnessed up close just how strong he remained—even when his body grew tired. His passing has left his family heartbroken and the football world reflecting on a life that, though far too short, left a lasting impact.Dean Wells entered the NFL in 1993 as a fourth-round pick by the Seattle Seahawks , and he wasted no time making an impression. Standing 6-foot-3 and weighing 248 pounds, he was a true force on the field. Over six seasons with the Seahawks (1993–1998), Wells became one of the team’s most dependable defenders.In 1999, he joined the Carolina Panthers , where he played three more seasons and continued to anchor the defense until 2001. Across his nine-year NFL career, Wells racked up 529 tackles , 2.5 sacks, three interceptions, six forced fumbles, and four fumble recoveries.But what truly set him apart wasn’t just the stat sheet—it was his football IQ, his steady locker room leadership, and his willingness to always do the tough, thankless jobs that help teams win.Dean Wells wasn’t just a linebacker. He was a fighter, a teammate, a husband, and a father—a man who showed the world how to face adversity with quiet courage and dignity.Though his life was cut short, the mark he left on the game, and on everyone who knew him, is permanent.Rest easy, Dean.

NEW DELHI: Despite Lucknow Super Giants ’ (LSG) disappointing eight-wicket defeat to Punjab Kings (PBKS) in the 2025 IPL, franchise owner Sanjiv Goenka has kept his faith in Rishabh Pant ’s leadership abilities.He delivered a stirring message -- one that not only motivated his squad but also highlighted his unwavering faith in skipper's potential.Also See: IPL Live Score, LSG vs MI In a conversation with Star Sports, Goenka made a striking declaration: “The moment we knew he (Rishabh) was not being retained, we planned the team around him. I've said this before, and I have no hesitation in saying it again: I believe he's a great leader. His best leadership is yet to come. So, 27 is the number we got him at. If it had meant 28, that would have been the number.”Goenka emphasised that Pant’s leadership journey is still unfolding, and that LSG is fully invested in his aggressive, instinct-driven style. “We were very clear—we needed a leader who trusts and backs his instincts, who is fearless, who is destructive. And in Rishabh, we get all of that,” he added.Pant, however, endured a tough outing against Punjab, managing just two runs. LSG’s top order faltered, with Mitchell Marsh falling for a golden duck, but a gritty 65-run stand between Nicholas Pooran (44) and Ayush Badoni (41) helped steady the innings.Late cameos from David Miller and Abdul Samad took the team to 171/7, but it proved insufficient.Punjab’s openers were ruthless in reply. Prabhsimran Singh smashed 69 off 34 balls, while Shreyas Iyer (52 not out) and Nehal Wadhera (43 not out) chased down the target with ease, sealing the win in just 16.2 overs.Despite the loss, Goenka addressed the team with encouragement. “This evening, you are entitled to your disappointments.

But it was what followed that raised eyebrows — a fierce send-off by Rathi that echoed his celebration from LSG’s previous match against Punjab Kings, for which he had already been fined 25% of his match fees and handed one demerit point by the IPL Despite the prior punishment, Rathi repeated the gesture with no signs of restraint, unleashing the now ‘infamous’ paper celebration as Dhir walked off. The moment was quickly picked up by fans and is now sparking debate over whether further disciplinary action will follow.The earlier IPL statement had cited a Level 1 breach under Article 2.5 (relating to “using language, actions or gestures which disparage or could provoke an aggressive reaction”), and while Rathi had accepted the sanction, his actions on Friday suggest he isn’t backing down from his trademark aggression.With two send-offs in two games, the league and match referee may have a bigger decision to make, as repeated breaches could lead to sterner consequences.","Lucknow Super Giants spinner Digvesh Rathi sent off Mumbai Indians batter Naman Dhir with a fierce send-off celebration.

Gianni Infantino says 2026 FIFA World Cup will feel like watching 104 Super Bowls in just one month



The age-old debate between American football and global football (soccer) has long stirred passionate arguments. While the NFL dominates the sports landscape in the United States with the Super Bowl as its crown jewel, the rest of the world pledges allegiance to the beautiful game—football. And now, FIFA President Gianni Infantino has reignited that conversation by comparing the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup to not just one Super Bowl, but “104 Super Bowls in a month.”Gianni Infantino’s comments came during an appearance on The Herd with Colin Cowherd, where he made a bold case for the World Cup's global supremacy. “The impact will be global,” Infantino said. “I mean look at the Super Bowl, which is fantastic. It has what, 120, 130 million viewers, right? The World Cup has 6 billion viewers [over a month of matches], so a World Cup is 104 Super Bowls in a month—which is three Super Bowls a day... This can happen every week if you have the best league in the world.”The numbers speak volumes. Super Bowl LIX averaged 127.7 million viewers—a monumental feat by any standard. Yet, the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar pulled in a staggering 5 billion fans across all platforms, with the final between Argentina and France alone drawing 1.42 billion viewers. The average global live audience for the tournament stood at 175 million—higher than the population of most countries.While the Super Bowl offers a single-night spectacle filled with high-stakes action, star-studded halftime shows, and billion-dollar ad slots, the World Cup delivers 104 games spread across a month. It’s not just a sports event—it’s a global festival. That’s precisely what Infantino is banking on with the expanded 48-team format for the 2026 edition, hosted jointly by the United States, Canada, and Mexico.To warm up American fans for the main event, FIFA is launching the reimagined Club World Cup this summer. Slated from June 14 to July 13, it will feature 32 of the world’s top clubs including Manchester City, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, and Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami. Infantino labeled the competition as historic, saying, “The first time there will be a club truly crowned world champion by FIFA.”Though some critics argue that Infantino’s “104 Super Bowls” analogy is laced with exaggeration—especially considering not every World Cup match has the drama of a high-stakes final—the underlying message is clear: no other event rivals the global scope, frequency, and cultural impact of the World Cup.Also Read: ""Football Is for All"": Super Bowl champ Khalen Saunders’ LGBTQ-friendly football camp sends a powerful message of acceptance in the NFL So, while the NFL may rule Sundays in America, the 2026 FIFA World Cup is set to remind the world just how massive football really is.

Derrick Henry’s contract extension talks makes many fans uncomfortable about it



Derrick Henry sold his luxurious home to an unknown buyer for a whopping $1.6 million



Derrick Henry, one of the most popular and talented players in the league, has been in the news lately due to his deal with the Baltimore Ravens . The star player signed a two year deal with the team for a whopping $16 million last season and now there are rumours of a contract extension. But fans feel differently about the whole thing.Recently, The Athletic’s Jeff Zrebiec posted an update on X about what the Baltimore Ravens’ coach, John Harbaugh, said about Derrick Henry’s situation. The post read as, “Harbaugh said that he'd like the team to extend RB Derrick Henry who is in last year of deal.”According to a transcript via the team, John Harbaugh recently spoke about Derrick Henry’s contract extension and said, ""It's definitely in the conversation. I know that's been talked about, and yes, I'd love to see that get done as well.""But fans feel uncomfortable with this. A fan commented, “Like how long? He's 31. That's 75 in RB years”, while another fan wrote, “I love Henry, but he's entering his 31 year old season and father time is undefeated. In the history of the NFL, how many 32+ year old great RB's have we seen? How long does Harbaugh want to Extend him?”A third fan wrote, “Id be careful rewarding veteran RB’s with long term deals. The Ravens could regret this decision a year from now”, while another user commented, “Long term deal? Anything more than 2 years is foolish.”However, other fans support this decision of the Baltimore Ravens. A fan commented, “Derrick is like the LeBron of football. Both take great care of their bodies and hold themselves to another standard. I believe he has a good few more years in him”.Another fan wrote, “Frank Gore played until he was 37 and Henry had alot less wear/tear than Gore did at 30”.Neither the Baltimore Ravens nor Derrick Henry has issued a statement about this whole situation. As of now, nothing has been confirmed, but the star player has continued to prove his worth on the field.In the 2024 season of the NFL, Derrick Henry scored 18 touchdowns and ran for 1,921 yards.Recently, Derrick Henry has also been in the news for personal reasons. As per TMZ, the NFL star recently sold his luxurious house in Dallas for a whopping $1.6 million.According to TMZ, apparently, Derrick Henry initially listed the price as $1.8 million but then brought it down to $1.6 million a few months later and sold it to an unidentified buyer.Derrick Henry has not issued a statement about this yet and is currently busy focusing on keeping himself healthy.Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are reportedly making a shocking strategic move amid growing relationship speculations","Derrick Henry has been in the news lately due to his deal with the Baltimore Ravens.

Alex Ovechkin isn’t just hunting Wayne Gretzky ’s all-time NHL goal record, he’s reshaping what legacy, loyalty, and longevity mean in the modern era.When the Washington Capitals star found the back of the net twice against the Chicago Blackhawks, tying Gretzky’s mythical 894-goal mark, the roar inside Capital One Arena was deafening but the emotion ran deeper than the celebration. For fans, it wasn’t just about numbers. It was about witnessing a player who never left, who never faded, and who never stopped delivering.Ovechkin’s story isn’t one of overnight dominance. It’s one of relentless persistence. In a sports world where superstars bounce between franchises, Ovechkin stayed rooted in Washington. Through playoff droughts, rebuilds, and roster changes, he became the identity of the Capitals. And now, with the all-time goal record in reach, he’s become something even rarer: a symbol of enduring excellence.He didn’t just play for a city, he grew with it. His journey mirrors Washington’s rise from underdogs to champions, with every goal adding another chapter to the franchise’s legacy.What makes this milestone hit differently is how it reflects the evolution of the NHL. Ovechkin didn’t just survive different generations of play, he conquered them. From the grinding physicality of the early 2000s to today’s faster, finesse-driven game, he remained lethal. His signature left-circle shot is now as iconic as Gretzky’s office behind the net.Wayne Gretzky himself, present in the building, didn’t look on with hesitation or regret but with pride. His words painted Ovechkin not as a record-snatcher, but as a worthy heir to hockey’s throne. And in doing so, he gave the green light for a new era to fully take hold.Also Read: Why NHL offer sheets could be league's next big power move With a handful of games remaining in the regular season, Ovechkin is poised to score goal No. 895 and step into uncharted territory. But here’s the truth, he’s already made history. Not just with his stick, but with his loyalty, his passion, and his unwavering dedication to one city and one jersey.","Alex Ovechkin scored twice against the Chicago Blackhawks to tie Wayne Gretzky's all-time NHL goal record of 894.

NBA champion Dwight Howard selected to Naismith Hall of Fame



The eight-time NBA All-Star and three-time Defensive Player of the Year Dwight Howard has been elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Class of 2025, and he’s getting in on the first ballot. This honor caps off a career filled with accolades, milestones, and his huge contribution to the league, alongside his impact on the games during his career spanning 18 years.ESPN’s Shams Charania broke the news Friday, noting that Dwight Howard will join the likes of Carmelo Anthony, Sue Bird, and Billy Donovan in what promises to be a star-studded class. The official announcement will take place during the NCAA Final Four, with enshrinement scheduled for September 6 in Springfield, Massachusetts.“Dwight Howard has been elected as a first-ballot member of the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame Class of 2025, sources tell ESPN. Howard was an 8-time All-Star, 8-time All-NBA, 3-time Defensive Player of Year, a 2020 NBA champion, and won one Olympic gold medal with Team USA,” Charania wrote on X.Selected first overall in the 2004 NBA Draft by the Orlando Magic , Howard became the face of the franchise throughout the late 2000s, earning six All-Star selections, five All-NBA First Team honors, and three consecutive Defensive Player of the Year awards during his eight seasons in Orlando.During his Magic tenure, he appeared in 621 regular-season games, averaging 18.4 points, 13.0 rebounds, and 2.2 blocks per game. More impressively, he led the team to six playoff appearances— including a trip to the 2009 NBA Finals and the 2010 Eastern Conference Finals.Howard’s numbers in the postseason were equally commanding. In 57 playoff games with Orlando, he posted averages of 19.9 points, 14.4 rebounds, and 2.8 blocks, cementing his role as a clutch performer in big moments.Before the Hall of Fame call came, Howard was recently inducted into the Orlando Magic Hall of Fame on March 24, becoming the 13th player to receive that honor in the franchise’s 36-year history.Howard’s career spanned 18 seasons in the NBA, and he played for the Lakers, Rockets, Hawks, Hornets, Wizards, and 76ers.Also Read: Dwight Howard’s $7 million WNBA fraud nightmare ends as conman gets 12 years Howard’s career totals speak volumes with 19,485 points, 11,913 rebounds, 2,228 blocks, and 58.7% field goal shooting.","Dwight Howard has been elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Class of 2025.

Henry Cejudo BRUTALLY HONEST on Relationship with Dana White

champion Henry Cejudo announced his retirement in 2020 after defending his bantamweight belt against Dominick Cruz. Three years later, the fighter was seen back in the ring against Aljaman Sterling at UFC 288 , where he lost the title to Sterling. Ever since, Cejudo has been on a losing streak, with back-to-back defeats handed over to him by Merab Dvalishvili and Song Yadong . His recent bout against Yadong led to the controversial eye poke situation, an injury Cejudo is still recovering from. In a recent interview with The Schmo, Triple C shares his honest opinion about hiswith the UFC president ,Henry Cejudo is among the few fighters who have won titles across multiple weight divisions - flyweight and bantamweight. His skills and dedication in the combat sport had a lot of MMA experts investing hope in the promising career of the fighter. However, his retirement announcement in 2020 brought in a sudden sense of disappointment as many thought that the announcement was simply a means of negotiating his contract with the UFC. Consequently, he moved out of the promotion, along with the bantamweight title being vacated and his name being removed from the ranking list. Three years later, the fighter stepped back into the ring, but the outcome was not as expected. Losing the title to Aljaman Sterling, Cejudo opened the accounts to another couple of losses that followed. From the last three bouts of his career, Cejudo seems to be more eager about a rematch with Song Yadong. However, his request for a rematch was shot down by the UFC president, Dana White.Talking about his relationship with the UFC president, Cejudo thinks that Dana is still pissed at the fighter following his announcement in 2020.“I think Dana is still pissed at me because I retired in 2020. I don’t think in his eyes, he would probably give that to me. I think he probably thinks I bitched out.” Cejudo continues to express his desire for a rematch against Yadong. “But if I could get anybody, what who I would want. That’s it.”When asked about any sort of sign regarding Dana being still pissed, the fighter stated, “Oh you can just tell bro. I mean who know what I am saying is like he thought I could have become the greatest of the greatest mixed martial artist of all time. Dana had a lot of hope in me. And you know I left for three years, came back and it shot me in the a**”Despite the setback, the fighter has no regrets and is completely focused into his family, “Not at all dude. Its about my family, I am here to make money!”Also read: Jon Jones reacts to rumors of his involvement in Dana White’s new ranking system- “Its undebatable” While the Triple C expects a rematch with Song Yadong, UFC president Dana White has completely negated the chances of it, stating that he doesn’t want to see it anymore.

Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter steal the spotlight at Colorado showcase



The 2025 NFL Draft landscape may have found its most compelling narrative — and it begins with Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter, two standouts from the Colorado Buffaloes who delivered eye-catching performances during their pro day. In a showcase attended by representatives from all 32 NFL teams, including some high-ranking executives and coaches, both players managed to solidify their status as top-tier draft prospects, while also raising anticipation around where they might land next.For Travis Hunter, whose two-way dominance on the field has already captivated fans and scouts alike, the pro day served more as a reaffirmation than a proving ground. Despite not participating in combine testing earlier, Hunter chose to demonstrate his elite athleticism by running a series of smooth, precise routes — and catching passes from Sanders without gloves, no less. The Heisman Trophy winner and collegiate ironman is widely expected to be a top-five pick, and nothing from Friday seemed to shake that belief.Hunter chose not to speak to the media post-workout, letting his on-field performance and game tape do the talking. And it spoke volumes. He may not be a mystery, but he's certainly still a marvel — a rarity in today’s game, blending lockdown corner skills with receiver finesse, and NFL teams know it.But if Hunter reaffirmed his value, Shedeur Sanders made sure the world knew his potential ceiling.Sanders completed 62 of 67 passes in his throwing session, showcasing his trademark precision, timing, and arm strength. Of the five incompletions, three were attributed to drops. One deep ball — a 55-yard strike to Jimmy Horn Jr. — drew particular praise from scouts, highlighting his ability to deliver downfield throws with accuracy and poise.The workout may have taken place in shorts and a T-shirt, devoid of live defense, but Shedeur's control and confidence stood out. With a number of NFL decision-makers on site — including Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam and head coach Kevin Stefanski — Shedeur’s name continues to rise in draft projections, potentially climbing as high as the second overall pick.Despite most mock drafts placing Miami's Cam Ward at No. 1, Shedeur remains undeterred. He boldly declared himself as “the top quarterback in the NFL draft,” a statement that may not reflect consensus rankings, but certainly reflects his belief — and his father’s, too.Deion Sanders , who not only coaches Shedeur and Hunter but also knows a thing or two about NFL greatness himself, was unequivocal in his praise.""I think we have the most qualified guys in the draft,"" Deion told reporters. ""They're not a risk… I'm not a betting man, I'm a Godly man, but the surest bets in this draft are those two young men. And I didn't stutter or stammer when I said that… Mic drop, let's go.""His confidence didn’t waver even in front of a national audience. Appearing on NFL Network, Deion doubled down: “He and Travis Hunter, to me, are the most bankable two young men in this draft… Shedeur, nothing but consistency… and Travis Hunter, ain't nobody like him.”With one eye on fit and one on opportunity, Deion hinted at the Browns being a potential match, describing the franchise as a team that could bring out the best in Shedeur. After all, success in the NFL isn’t just about talent — it’s about being in the right system with the right support.In a draft class filled with promise and unpredictability, Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter may just be the safest, most dynamic bets. Their pro day didn’t just impress — it made a statement.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers’ quiet stance reportedly signals a shift away from Pittsburgh Steelers toward Minnesota Vikings","Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter steal the spotlight at Colorado showcase pro day.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Jos Buttler Exclusive Interview: I owe Jayawardene for letting me open in T20

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants held their nerve to clinch a thrilling 12-run victory over Mumbai Indians in Match 16 of IPL 2025 at the Ekana Cricket Stadium on Friday.While Mitchell Marsh’s explosive 60 (off 31 balls) and Hardik Pandya ’s five-wicket haul dominated headlines early on, it was young leg-spinner Digvesh Singh Rathi who turned the tide in LSG’s favour with a sensational spell under pressure and notched up the Player of the Match award in the process.Batting first, LSG posted a commanding 203/8, thanks to Marsh’s 60 off 31 balls and late fireworks from David Miller (27 off 14).Hardik Pandya was the pick of the MI bowlers, bagging five wickets, including key dismissals of Nicolas Pooran, Rishabh Pant, David Miller, and Aiden Markram, keeping MI within reach.However, the real story unfolded in the second innings, where Mumbai seemed to be cruising with Suryakumar Yadav in ominous form.At 86/2 in the 9th over, MI looked set to chase the target down. But Digvesh Singh Rathi, playing only his second IPL match, changed the game with a crucial breakthrough. He removed the dangerous Naman Dhir for 46 with a sharp delivery that skidded on and bowled him, derailing MI’s momentum.The spinner's figures of 1/21 were not just economical, but tactically brilliant.Bowling with superb control and guile, he applied pressure in the middle overs, conceding just 11 runs in his final two overs when MI were gearing up for a final assault.His tight spell forced the batters to take risks at the other end, eventually leading to Suryakumar’s dismissal in the 17th over.Even with Hardik Pandya launching a late onslaught, LSG’s total proved just out of reach for MI, who ended at 191/5.Rathi’s composure and fearless approach stood out, marking him as a rising star in LSG’s ranks.This win lifts LSG to sixth on the table and gives their campaign fresh momentum.For MI, questions remain over their middle-order finishing and death bowling. But if there’s one name they won’t forget from this game, it’s Digvesh Singh Rathi.",Lucknow Super Giants beat Mumbai Indians by 12 runs in IPL 2025.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals (RR), now back under the leadership of Sanju Samson , will take on an in-form Punjab Kings (PBKS) in a high-stakes Indian Premier League IPL ) 2025 clash on Saturday.A big focus of the match will be on a struggling Yashasvi Jaiswal , who will be eager to shift attention back to his batting. Jaiswal has had a turbulent few weeks — switching domestic allegiances from Mumbai to Goa amid reported internal rifts and posting underwhelming scores of 1, 29 and 4 in this IPL season. The 22-year-old southpaw, hungry for leadership roles, now finds himself needing runs more than ever, especially after being overlooked for the Champions Trophy squad.Samson’s return as captain comes after RR’s inconsistent run under stand-in skipper Riyan Parag, whose leadership failed to inspire despite a narrow win over Chennai Super Kings. The Royals’ batting remains heavily reliant on Samson, with Shimron Hetmyer expected to provide the finishing firepower. However, Jaiswal and Dhruv Jurel’s form will be key in putting up or chasing a big score.Punjab Kings, meanwhile, come in hot — led impressively by Shreyas Iyer , who has scored back-to-back half-centuries and already smashed 13 sixes in two games, equaling his tally from all of last season. Iyer's tactical nous has stood out too, with sharp field placements and smart bowling changes, including effective use of Glenn Maxwell the spinner, who’s looked sharper than even Yuzvendra Chahal.Rajasthan’s bowling attack — with Jofra Archer, Maheesh Theekshana, Wanindu Hasaranga, and Tushar Deshpande — is solid but not fearsome.
