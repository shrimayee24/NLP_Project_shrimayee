IF INDIA WIN

IF USA WIN

At the end of the T20 World Cup match between India and USA scheduled for later on Wednesday, Group A will have one of its two qualifiers for the 'Super 8' phase of the tournament.The 2007 champions India are primed to register a hat-trick of wins to advance to the next stage; but USA's giant-killing run can't be taken lightly.Ahead of the T20 World Cup, USA defeated Bangladesh to win a historic bilateral series -- their first against a Test-playing nation.It followed an even bigger upset, shocking Pakistan in their second group match of the T20 tournament. In between, the US team defeated neighbours Canada in the tournament opener.With two wins in as many matches, USA, like India, are unbeaten in the tournament; but face their biggest test against Rohit Sharma & Co.USA's stay at the top of the group after back-to-back wins didn't last for long as India won the battle against the archrivals Pakistan, beating them by six runs in a thrilling contest.The win took India (2 matches, 4 points, NRR +1.455) to No. 1 spot in Group A, followed by USA (2 matches, 4 points, NRR +0.626), Pakistan (3 matches, 2 points, NRR +0.191), Canada (3 matches, 2 points, NRR -0.493) and Ireland (2 matches, 0 point, NRR -1.712).Here's a look at how the result in India vs USA match on Wednesday will affect the 'Super 8' qualification scenario of the five teams in Group A:A victory for India will mean that the former champions will advance to the next stage, where they will join South Africa and Australia -- the two teams so far to have made it to the 'Super 8s'. That result will also breathe new life into Pakistan's campaign that stayed alive after their win over Canada. However, Pakistan will hope that India register a big win over USA and seriously dent the net run-rate of the American team, which at present is better than that of Pakistan's.But even if USA lose to India, they will have a chance to progress to the 'Super 8s' with a win over Ireland in their last match, which will make all other remaining games in the group irrelevant and eliminate the other three teams.In case USA's dream run in their tournament debut continues with another upset win, they will go through to the 'Super 8s'. However, that result will not favour Pakistan, Canada and Ireland.If India lose to the US and win their last match against minnows Canada, they will join the co-hosts as the two teams in 'Super 8s' from Group A, putting the remaining three out of the race.",T20 World Cup match between India and USA scheduled for later on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: India's batting stars aim to overcome a tricky Nassau County pitch against an impressive but inexperienced USA in their T20 World Cup group match. India needs one more win to secure a Super Eight berth.Despite the pitch's two-paced nature, a high-risk approach could pay off better than against Pakistan. Indian Americans like Saurabh Netravalkar and Harmeet Singh will face their birth country, eager to bridge the gap with their diverse team.Also see: T20 WORLD CUP 2024 Schedule USA’s recent win over Pakistan could inspire a standout performance.Facing India's top players like Rohit Sharma , Virat Kohli , and Jasprit Bumrah offers the USA valuable experience.India's last match in this venue might see them opt to bat first, with Bumrah, Siraj, and Jadeja posing a tough challenge for USA's batsmen. Emotional subplots include Netravalkar bowling to former teammate Suryakumar Yadav, and USA spinners Harmeet and Kenjige attempting to contain Rishabh Pant.India has never faced the USA in a T20 International, making their upcoming clash in the T20 World Cup a historic encounter. This match not only marks the first time these two teams will compete in this format, but it also highlights the growing global reach of cricket For India, a cricketing powerhouse, playing against a burgeoning cricket nation like the USA provides an opportunity to showcase their dominance and experience. Meanwhile, for the USA, this match offers a chance to test their skills against one of the world's best teams, potentially drawing more attention to the sport in America and inspiring future generations of cricketers.The Nassau County International Cricket Stadium boasts a bowling-friendly pitch that presents significant challenges for batters, often leading to low-scoring matches. The pitch offers substantial assistance to pace bowlers, making it difficult for batters to score runs freely. Consequently, teams may find it advantageous to chase targets at this ground due to the batting difficulties.Nassau County International Cricket Stadium has hosted seven T20 matches, with teams winning three times while batting first and four times while chasing. The average first innings score is 107, and the average second innings score is 105, indicating that the pitch provides a balanced contest between bat and ball.The highest total recorded at this venue is 137/7 by Canada against Ireland, demonstrating the challenges batters face in posting high scores. Conversely, Sri Lanka hold the record for the lowest total, being bowled out for 77 in 19.1 overs against South Africa, underscoring the pitch's difficulty for batting.Chasing teams have had notable success at this stadium, with Pakistan achieving the highest successful chase of 107/3 in 17.3 overs against Canada. On the defensive side, South Africa hold the record for the lowest total successfully defended, restricting Bangladesh to 113/6 in their 20 overs.1) Given the low average scores and the difficulty batters face in posting high totals at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, prioritize selecting strong bowlers for your fantasy team. Focus on picking pace bowlers, as they are likely to exploit the pitch conditions effectively, similar to how South Africa restricted Sri Lanka to 77 runs and defended a modest total of 113 against Bangladesh.2) Since teams have won more frequently while chasing (four out of seven matches), consider including reliable middle-order batsmen who can stabilize and anchor the innings during a chase. Players who are adept at handling pressure and have a proven track record in run chases, like Pakistan's successful pursuit of 107 against Canada, would be valuable additions to your fantasy lineup.Hardik Pandya will be a crucial player for India, bringing his all-round capabilities to the fore in the match against the USA. Known for his explosive batting, Pandya can provide the much-needed impetus during the middle and death overs. Additionally, his ability to bowl crucial overs, especially in high-pressure situations, makes him an invaluable asset. His experience and versatility are likely to play a significant role in navigating the tricky Nassau County pitch.Jasprit Bumrah's ability as one of the world’s premier fast bowlers will be pivotal for India against the USA. His mastery in delivering yorkers and slower balls with precision, particularly on a pitch that aids seamers, could stifle the opposition's batting lineup. Bumrah’s knack for taking early wickets and his effectiveness at the death make him a formidable opponent, likely to challenge the USA batsmen throughout the innings.Saurabh Netravalkar, a former India U-19 player, now spearheading the USA bowling attack, will be a key player to watch. His familiarity with Indian players and experience in various conditions could provide an edge. Netravalkar’s left-arm seam bowling, combined with his ability to swing the ball, will be crucial in exploiting any weaknesses in the Indian batting lineup.Rohit Sharma (c), Hardik Pandya, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant, Sanju Samson, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd.

He added the cherry on the cake by also dismissing his former Mumbai senior and current India captain Rohit Sharma.These lines from The New Colossus, the 1883 poem by Emma Lazarus, are etched in bronze on the Statue of Liberty’s pedestal and stand as a promise of the American Dream at the heart of the message for any immigrant coming to the US.One of those stories that took a roundabout route involved Santiago Munez, the fictional protagonist of Goal: The Dream Begins (2005), an illegal immigrant from Los Angeles who travels to the Premier League and becomes a big-time ball player with Newcastle United. The tale of an illegal American immigrant from Los Angeles crossing the oceans to become a big-game ball player was a little different from the one promised by the words etched on the Statue of Liberty, but 19 years later, Saurabh Netravalkar, not an illegal immigrant per se, seems to be living the same dream but with whipped cream on top.Netravalkar is living both the American dream (becoming a professionally successful migrant in the Shining City on the Top of the Hill) and the Indian dream (beating Pakistan in a crunch match) at the same time. Next up he faces off against the nation he represented as a youngster, against team members with whom he has shared the dressing room.Netravalkar’s story is remarkably amazing.As a profile in The Times put it: “Such is the fine balance America’s newest — and perhaps most unlikely — sporting hero has had to strike to keep his cricket dreams alive that software engineer Saurabh Netravalkar has even been known to spend the lunch interval during club matches hunched over his work laptop, either coding or in a meeting with colleagues via video call. At last, however, all those hours spent juggling the demands of a full-time job with tech giant Oracle while simultaneously playing professional sports have finally paid off.”When he’s not bowling at Pakistan with the fury of an engineer asked to do a task without a valid JIRA ticket, Netravalkar’s day job is as a Principal Engineer at Oracle. And, as if being an international-level cricketer and a coder par excellence wasn’t enough to brag about, Netravalkar is also a talented Ukulele player and married to Devi Snighda Upalla, who also happens to be a Principal Oracle Engineer and a talented Kathak dancer whose Bolly X Fitness program is quite the rage. It would appear that talent and luck are not democratically allocated when it’s being handed out either by a higher being or evolution.Netravalkar’s meteoric rise as an Indian-American migrant comes at a time when folks of Indian origin can be found on both sides of the political spectrum as well as the upper echelons of American society with the exception of sports. It’s fair to say that of all immigrant groups – turning up on American shores for a better life – none have made their mark on America much like Indian-Americans. They are the highest-earning minority group. In politics, the so-called Samosa Caucus – a term to describe a modest number of Indian-Americans in Congress – has exploded on both sides of politics. On the Republican side, you’ve Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley, whilein the Democrats setup includes the vice-president Kamala Harris and several others serving in the House of Representatives. In business, Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella are the headliners among 21 billion-dollar companies that are led by Indian Americans. Even among Nobel Laureates, you have the likes of Amartya Sen, Abhijit Banerjee, and Venki Ramakrishnan but none of them appear to have ticked more than one box like Netravalkar.As one Instagram user put it: “Bro casually sings, works as an engineer full time, and owns Pakistan for a hobby.”So, how did Saurabh Netravalkar become the poster child of the Indian and American dream? It all started in the greatest cricketing city on the planet: Mumbai.The abode of many cricketing legends including Sachin Tendulkar , Sunil Gavaskar, Ravi Shastri, and current India captain Rohit Sharma, many youngsters grow up in the city with the hope of playing for India.Mumbai has won the most Ranji trophies with 42 wins in 88 seasons. The wide gulf in class is evident from the fact that the number 2 spot is held by Karnataka who have won the domestic tournament 8 times. But Mumbai’s success can also be a hindrance and it’s perhaps the hardest team to break into for any player. Even Sachin Tendulkar’s son Arjun – a nifty fast bowler – had to switch allegiances to Goa to get regular game time.But the odds didn’t appear to deter Netravalkar who came into the limelight in 2009 when he rattled Yuvraj Singh’s stump at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru. Yuvraj by then had already become part of Indian cricketing folklore after his stupendous India debut in the 2000 ICC Knock Out Trophy when he scored 84 unbeaten in 80 runs against an Aussie pace attack consisting of Bret Lee, Glen McGrath, and Jason Gillespie.Fortune seemed to be smiling on Netravalkar when he was called up for the BCCI Corporate Trophy where he shared the dressing room with the likes of Yuvraj Singh, Robin Uthappa, and Suresh Raina, while the opposing camp had Messrs Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni. He also had a superlative 2010 U-19 Cricket World Cup, where he was the leading wicket-taker for India. However, breaking into the senior setup proved more difficult. At that time, the Mumbai squad was teeming with pacers like Ajit Agarkar, Zaheer Khan, and others.Taking a call to give his cricket career a boost, he missed a full semester to focus on the game. Netravalkar made his Ranji debut in 2013 but being in and out of the team meant he bid adieu to the game he loved and took the more practical route of going back to his studies.Fate appeared to have shut the cricket door forever when Cornell University in New York in 2015 offered him a scholarship after being impressed with his player analysis app called CricDecode (If you search, you can still find the app’s code on the developer platform GitHub).After he graduated from Cornell, he was offered a job by Oracle in San Francisco and having left his cricket kit back home, started playing recreationally on weekends to fit in.Fate intervened when the ICC changed its rules – from four years to three years – for residents to represent their adopted nations. An H1B card holder, Netravalkar broke into the US squad in 2018 and even captained the team for three years.Like all cricket-crazy fans in India, Netrvalkar and his father Naresh watched many matches together in the 1990s and 2000s. His favorite bowlers were Wasim Akram, Chaminda Vaas, and Zaheer Khan. Perhaps those fantasies would have remained a dream had it not been for the US co-hosting the T20 Cricket World Cup as Netravalkar showed that he had what it takes to face off against the big boys. Incidentally, in 2010, in the Under-19 Cricket World Cup, Netravalkar faced heartbreak when Team India lost to the Pakistan team that had a young Babar Azam.On June 12, Netravalkar will face off against players he knows from a lifetime ago, whose exploits he might have followed on the news or social media.While Virat Kohli was in the opposing camp in the BCCI Corporate Championship, current captain Rohit Sharma was a senior in the Mumbai squad. Meanwhile, Surya Kumar Yadav, a batsman who has redefined T20 cricket with his avant-garde batting style was a contemporary in the Mumbai dressing room.Opposing coach Rahul Dravid, who watched him bowl the Super Over against Pakistan, is also someone he bowled to at the National Cricket Academy many years ago.In fact, there’s an almost epochal tinge to Netravalkar’s exponential rise in the first T20 tournament held in the land that Columbus thought he had discovered, and the one he actually discovered as Columbus as the USA faces off against the land that Columbus hoped to discover. That at the heart of the story would be a young man from Mumbai in US colours makes this an even greater tale.In the vintage video game Cricket ’97, the sagacious Richie Benaud had a line that went: “You know not much is wrong with the world when you can hear the sound of leather hitting the willow.” For a long time, the United States was one nation where the sound of willow and leather hitting was missing (unless one counts baseball) but all that looks set to change after this World Cup. Americans, not just the diaspora, appear to have fully embraced the sport and amid the heart of that has been an Oracle engineer simultaneously living the American and Indian dream. There are engineers who play cricket and cricketers who are engineers, but there's hardly anyone who is so proficient at both.In fact, there’s a video on his Instagram where Netravalkar, while watching the India vs Pakistan game says in chaste Marathi that would make even South Bombay residents stop in their tracks: “Definitely come on June 12 to support us on the ground.” Many fans – irrespective of their nationality or giving a fig about the Tebbit Test - would be forgiven if, for a small moment, they decide to back the young lad from Mumbai in US colours who dared to dream as he bowls against the likes of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.","Saurabh Netravalkar is living both the American dream and the Indian dream at the same time. The software engineer is also a talented Ukulele player and married to Devi Snighda Upalla, who also happens to be a Principal Oracle Engineer and a talented Kathak dancer.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110944189,imgsize-129366,width-400,resizemode-4/110944189.jpg"

He will have time to settle and analyze the game. Scoring 50-60 runs would be great for him. His stats at this position in previous World Cups are impressive.

NEW DELHI: India survived early hiccups to overcome 'giant killers' USA and become the third team to qualify for Super Eight stage after Australia and South Africa.With a seven-wicket victory, India remained unbeaten with their third victory on the trot in Group A after defeating Ireland and Pakistan.Chasing 111, India found themselves at the spot of bother at 3/44 in 7.3 overs.

This sudden shift in momentum proved to be a turning point of the game.The reason for the co-hosts to have been docked five penalty runs was because USA took more than a minute between overs three times. And per the new rules, that's a penalty.According to the updated regulations, if a team exceeds the allotted 60 seconds to commence a new over on three occasions within an innings, they will face a penalty of five runs being deducted from their total score.The umpires have enforced this rule, and as a result, USA have been docked 5 penalty runs. This decision was made due to the team's repeated failure to start their overs within the stipulated time frame. The penalty runs will be added to the opposition's total, putting the USA team at a disadvantage.",India become third team to qualify for Super Eight stage after Australia and South Africa.

NEW DELHI: The USA cricket team set an unfortunate record in the annals of T20 World Cup history by recording one of the lowest powerplay scores against India during the 2024 T20 World Cup match in New York on Wednesday.Team USA managed to score just 18 runs for the loss of two wickets in the first six overs. This was also the USA's lowest powerplay total in T20Is.This performance stands as the lowest powerplay score against India in the history of the tournament, underscoring the challenges faced by the USA batters against the formidable Indian bowling attack.Left-arm Indian seamer Arshdeep Singh made an immediate impact when he opened the bowling against the USA in the Group A encounter. His first delivery resulted in the dismissal of USA opener Shayan Jahangir , who was adjudged leg before wicket, for duck. The young Indian seamer continued his impressive spell by claiming another wicket in the same over, removing Andries Gous (2).Team India has a history of stifling opponents during the powerplay in T20 World Cups. For instance, in 2014, the West Indies team, despite not losing any wickets, could only manage 24 runs in their powerplay in Mirpur.Similarly, in the 2022 T20 World Cup, South Africa faced a daunting task against India in Perth. The Proteas were restricted to just 24 runs for the loss of three wickets during their powerplay. This performance highlighted India's knack for taking crucial early wickets while keeping the run rate in check.Ireland, too, struggled against India in the 2024 T20 World Cup match in New York. The Irish team scored only 26 runs for the loss of two wickets in their powerplay overs. This match further illustrated India's consistent ability to dominate the early stages of the game, setting the stage for a controlled bowling performance throughout the innings.These instances of low powerplay scores are a testament to the Indian bowling unit's effectiveness in T20 World Cups. The bowlers have repeatedly demonstrated their capability to apply early pressure, restrict scoring opportunities, and capture key wickets, leading to India's success on the global stage.","Team USA managed to score just 18 runs for the loss of two wickets in the first six overs.

The left-arm pacer claimed the wickets of Shayan Jahangir and Andries Gous, leaving the Americans reeling at 2-2. However, a partnership between Steven Taylor and Nitish Kumar helped stabilize the innings, enabling the United States to post a respectable total of 110-8 in their allotted overs.India's chase began on a shaky note, as Saurabh Netravalkar struck early, dismissing the experienced duo of Virat Kohli (o) and Rohit Sharma (3) cheaply. With the team in trouble, Suryakumar (50*) and Shivam Dube (31*) took on the responsibility of rebuilding the innings. Yadav's unbeaten half-century, combined with Dube's valuable contribution, ensured that India reached the target comfortably, sealing the victory with 10 balls to spare.Rohit gave full credit to the team for chasing down the target as it was going to be a tough task.""We knew it was going to be a tough task, scoring that many.

NEW YORK: India’s New York assignment is over and it’s been quite outstanding, to say the least. But there’s a slight hint of cloud developing as India go on their further assignments, as they move to Miami for the second leg.There’s nothing about the opposition that is going to worry them at Fort Lauderhill — minnows Canada should be easy meat. But there’s a storm brewing over Miami, and there could be a case where the game may not be played at all.In fact, flights have started getting cancelled as flood alerts keep coming and even before India entered the ground for their match against the United States, everyone was keeping tabs on Miami’s weather forecast for the next few days.More than the game, India will not get the two intense sessions of practice in Miami, that may just hurt them as they gear up for the more difficult leg of their World Cup sojourn — the West Indies.“We hope that the weather clears up on time so that we get a game. But if we don’t, there’s not much that we can do about it,” Team India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey said on Wednesday.India’s game against Canada is on June 16 while their first game in West Indies is on June 20. Every game in the Super 8 is a must-win and India’s potential opponents— Australia, England, Afghanistan and New Zealand — have all been playing in the West Indies. It has given them enough time to get used to the Caribbean conditions, which should stand them in good stead in the Super 8s.India, on the other hand, have been playing on quite unique conditions in New York and with a probable four-day gap before they get to work in the Windies, the break could be unwanted for a team that is looking to build momentum.Mhambrey, though, didn’t want to read too much into it, because he insists that “the team has experience” to deal with such difficulties.“I think the good thing is that we have already played in the West Indies — a couple of series out prior to this. So, more or less know what kind of a surface we’ll encounter out there. We have played in those conditions in India as well. If you travel in India, Wankhede is different to Gujarat or Delhi, so it’s not exactly alien conditions for us,” the bowling coach said.The pace bowlers have enjoyed themselves in New York, but that doesn’t mean that India will stick to the tried-andtested in West Indies as well. If there is some help in the pitch, Mhambrey said that Kuldeep Yadav can very well come into the equation.“He was in very good rhythm in the IPL and has been bowling well in the nets. He completely understands why he isn’t playing here, but that doesn’t mean he will not be in our equations in West Indies,” Mhambrey said, stressing on the flexibility that the India is aiming for to lift the trophy that they last won in 2007.","India are in Miami for the second leg of the T20 World Cup.

NEW DELHI: After suffering a 7-wicket defeat against India in the ICC T20 World Cup in New York, USA's stand-in captain Aaron Jones expressed that a total of 130 runs would have been a challenging target for the 'Men in Blue' to chase down.India's unbeaten streak in the T20 World Cup continued as they secured a 7-wicket victory over co-hosts USA in their Group A encounter at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium on Wednesday.Arshdeep Singh's impressive pace bowling, coupled with a 72-run partnership between Suryakumar Yadav and Shivam Dube , ensured India's place in the Super 8 .Jones commended his team's bowling performance, acknowledging that they made India work hard for every run scored. The world's top-ranked T20I side faced a potential upset when they were reduced to 10/2 while chasing a target of 111, with star openers Virat Kohli (0) and Rohit Sharma (3) dismissed early by Saurabh Netravalkar .Ali Khan further added to the pressure by dismissing Rishabh Pant with an outstanding delivery, but the USA couldn't capitalize on these breakthroughs.""10-15 runs short. If we got 130 then it would have been a tough total, that's how it goes sometimes. The boys were very disciplined and really proud of the bowling unit,"" Jones said in a post-match presentation.Looking ahead, Jones emphasized the need for restructuring and stated that the team will hold meetings before their next match against Ireland at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground in Florida on Friday.""Feels good, this is what we wanted for USA cricket, enjoying it. We will recalibrate now, have a few meetings and come back strong,"" he added.Commenting on the playing conditions, the 29-year-old batter noted that the pitch in New York was challenging and more conducive to seam bowling, which explained the absence of spin in the match.Jones also provided an update on captain Monank Patel, who missed the clash against India due to a minor injury, stating that he should be fit for their final group stage match.""The wicket was a bit tricky, more suited for seam bowling. That's why there is no spin. Mostly he (Monank Patel) should be fit for the last game, just got a slight niggle,"" he added.The USA will face Ireland at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground in Florida on Friday, aiming to secure a spot in the Super 8 stage of the tournament.","USA's stand-in captain Aaron Jones expressed that a total of 130 runs would have been a challenging target for the 'Men in Blue' to chase down.

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma , the captain of the Indian cricket team, acknowledged the challenges posed by the newly-laid drop-in pitch at Nassau County ground in New York during the ongoing T20 World Cup . The surface offered varying pace, making batting difficult throughout the match.Despite the tough conditions, India managed to secure victories in all three of their matches at this venue.India achieved the highest successful chase at this ground, reaching a target of 111/3 in response to the USA's 110/8.Key contributions from Arshdeep Singh , who took 4 wickets for just 9 runs, Suryakumar Yadav 's unbeaten 50, and Shivam Dube 's crucial unbeaten 31 runs helped secure the victory for the Indian side.“We knew it would be tough. Credit to us for the way we held our nerve and got that partnership. Credit to Surya and Dube for showing maturity and taking us through,” Rohit said after the match.The Indian captain appeared to be more relieved than ecstatic after his team successfully overcame the initial challenge in the international tournament. The win marked an important milestone for the Indian side, as they progressed to the next stage of the competition with renewed confidence and determination.“Being in the Super Eight is a big relief — playing cricket here wasn't easy (as) it could have been anyone's game. We had to stick through till the end in all three games. We will take a lot of confidence from these wins,” he added.Rohit commended the vital contributions of three players in the team's recent victory. He particularly lauded Suryakumar for adapting his typically aggressive batting style to play the role of an anchor during the run chase.“He (Suryakumar) showed he has a different game to him, that's what you expect from experienced players. Credit to the way he stuck through today to take the game deep and win it for us,” he said.“We knew the bowlers had to take the lead (as) run scoring was difficult. All the bowlers did the job, particularly Arshdeep,” said Rohit after India qualified for the Super Eight.Rohit explained that the team's decision to allow Dube to bowl was based on the anticipation of seamers playing a dominant role in the match.“You want options and we should be able to use them as and when we can. Today, the pitch favoured the seamers so I wanted to use him,” he said.“(A) lot of these guys have played cricket together, very happy to see their progress. Saw them last year in MLC as well, they are all hard-working guys,” Rohit said while talking about USA cricketers.Arshdeep, who achieved the best T20I bowling figures for India, expressed his desire to capitalise on the pitch that offered assistance to seam bowlers.“In the last two games, I gave away a few more runs, (and I) wasn't happy with that. The team always shows belief in me and keeps backing me, I had to deliver for them,” he said.“The wicket is very conducive to fast bowlers and it's helping us get some seam movement. The plan was simple, pitch it in the wicket and let the ball do the talking. Don't give easy balls to score, our batsmen are also facing difficulties to score runs,” he said.Talking further about his bowling plans, the left-arm bowler said, “The plan was to hit the hard lengths. In conditions like this, you can use the wicket more.”Aaron Jones, who served as the stand-in captain for the USA, believed that his team put up a respectable performance but ultimately fell short of the required total.“(We were) 10-15 runs short. If we got 130 then it would have been a tough total, that's how it goes sometimes. The boys were very disciplined, really proud of the bowling unit,” he said.“(It) feels good, this is what we wanted for USA cricket, enjoying it. We will recalibrate now, have a few meetings and come back strong,” he added.Jones stated that the USA's regular skipper, Monank Patel , is expected to recover and be ready to play in their final Group match against Ireland.“Mostly he should be fit for the last game, just got a slight niggle,” Jones said.","India achieved the highest successful chase at this ground, reaching a target of 111/3 in response to the USA's 110/8.

He also enjoyed success at the club level, winning five French championships with PSG and being part of Champions League-winning teams at Barcelona and Inter Milan .Juventus will be Motta's fourth coaching assignment, following brief stints at Genoa (2019), where he was dismissed after just one win in ten matches, La Spezia (2021-22), and Bologna.Last season, Juventus finished third in Serie A, 23 points behind champions Inter Milan, but managed to secure their 15th Italian Cup title. However, their season ended on a disappointing note, with only three wins in their last 17 league matches, despite being close to Inter at the start of the year.Allegri's dismissal came after his explosive behavior during the team's Italian Cup triumph, which the club deemed ""incompatible"" with its values.He was sent off in the final minutes of the 1-0 win against Atalanta for arguing with match officials and was also accused of manhandling and threatening the chief editor of newspaper Tuttosport. His actions led to an investigation by the Italian Football Federation's disciplinary authorities.During his two spells as Juventus manager, the 56-year-old Allegri won 12 trophies, including five Serie A titles, and reached two Champions League finals.","Juventus appoint Thiago Motta as their new head coach.

""We will talk with him in the next few days, no doubt about it.""Wirtz, a key player in Bayer Leverkusen's Bundesliga triumph last season, is all too familiar with the heartbreak of being absent from a significant international competition.The talented attacking midfielder was forced to sit out the 2022 World Cup due to an injury, leaving him to watch from the sidelines as his teammates competed on the global stage.""It was a huge setback for me, to be injured before the World Cup.

NEW DELHI: India's hopes of reaching the third round of the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers for the first time in their history were extinguished on Tuesday night following a 2-1 defeat to Asian champions Qatar.The loss, despite India holding the lead for a significant portion of the match, also means that the team will not secure automatic qualification for the AFC Asian Cup 2027 .The match itself highlighted both the potential and the shortcomings of the Indian side. Taking the lead against a formidable opponent like Qatar demonstrated attacking intent and tactical discipline. However, conceding a controversial equalizer and ultimately succumbing to a late winner exposed defensive vulnerabilities and a lack of concentration in crucial moments.In the aftermath of the defeat, newly appointed captain Gurpreet Singh Sandhu took to social media to address the disappointment and offer a message of hope for the future.""We had the belief, we had the chance to make amends even after everything. The boys gave everything on the pitch last night to make it happen but yet it didn’t. Yesterday’s unfortunate result and the incident of the equalizer is a lesson that where we want to go, you don’t just need the hook but the crook as well.

The 21-year-old sets up points, creates openings, and goes for high-risk shots; the stage of the match if he’s leading or trailing is irrelevant. Drop shots that skim the net, racy winners that go around the pole and outrageous forehands. He can run a marathon and win a sprint.The Spaniard plays every shot in the book and thinks up new ones on the run. He smiles during matches, sometimes dazzled by his own brilliance, other times in disbelief. An expression that says, why? Not really.Alcaraz, who won his third Grand Slam title on Sunday, his first at Roland Garros , is 11-1 in five-set matches. Against Alexander Zverev in the final of the French Open and world No.1 Jannik Sinner in the semifinals, Alcaraz motored from a 1-2 deficit in sets, not by keeping the ball in play, but by going for his shots. And like his last two opponents, Alcaraz was also running on reserve in the fourth and fifth sets, but he understood the only way he was crossing that finish line first was by winning it, not waiting for it.“He’s a beast. He’s an animal,” Zverev said of the 21-year-old. “The intensity he plays with is different to other people.”Alcaraz’s long-time coach Juan Carlos Ferrero talks as fast as the Spaniard charges the court, the duo is quite the vibe. Ferrero hurls instructions at the dynamo in the middle that leaves one wondering if he’s actually reminding Alcaraz of the defense they may have practiced a 1000 times.“I’m trying just to be aggressive, to go for it, play my style -- go to the net, dropshots, hitting big shots,” said Alcaraz . “If I lose it, if I miss it, my feelings are really good. If I lose, it doesn’t matter if I miss it, because when I go for it, the feelings are much better than if I go defensive and lose. My team is telling me to go for it.”Alcaraz is at No.2 in the rankings now which spreads the field for the new guard at Wimbledon, with Sinner and Alcaraz likely bookending the draw.“My game suits very well for every surface because I practice it (like that),” Alcaraz said. “I wanted to develop my style of being aggressive all the time, practicing the defense and all that stuff...but my main goal is being aggressive as much as I can. On grass, I have to play like that almost every time, but on all surfaces too.”Alcaraz — the youngest man to win a Grand Slam on three different surfaces after his triumphs on hard courts at the 2022 US Open and grass at 2023 Wimbledon – put a number against his achievements.“Obviously winning the US Open, when I reached for the first time the No. 1 ranking, is something that I dreamt of since I started playing tennis , getting my first Grand Slam was pretty special,” Alcaraz said. “But the way that I won Wimbledon, beating Novak Djokovic in five sets, has been a great achievement for me.”“Right now, lifting the Roland Garros trophy, knowing everything that I have been through the last month with the injuries...” he said. “Probably this one is the moment that I’m really proud of myself, because of everything that I have done the last month just to be ready for this tournament with my team. It has been really difficult for me.”“So I’m going to say that this one, Roland Garros,” he said, looking up at the packed media room, “is the one I’m most proud about.""","Carlos Alcaraz is the youngest man to win a Grand Slam on three different surfaces. The 21-year-old won his third Grand Slam title on Sunday, his first at Roland Garros.
