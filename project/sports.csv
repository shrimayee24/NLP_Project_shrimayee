Kant took oath in the name of God in presence of PM Narendra Modi, his Cabinet colleagues, Vice-President and Supreme Court and high court judges.CJI Kant's 235-strong guest list for the oath ceremony mirrored his endeavour to cherish the relationships he's nurtured since his days as an adolescent. Many nonagenarians and octogenarians who had watched him play as a boy on the dusty tracks of Petwar, a remote village in Hisar district, along with some of those who taught him in school and college, were part of the guest entourage that trotted into the dazzling Ashoka Hall to watch him being appointed the head of India's judiciary.Also present was outgoing CJI B R Gavai. Two eminent persons from Kant's home state - CM Naib Singh Saini and former Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankar - were seated in the front row.Justice Gavai gave his successor a warm hug after the oath ceremony. Though Justice Gavai had travelled to Rashtrapati Bhavan in CJI's official vehicle, he returned home in a car provided by Rashtrapati Bhavan.Usha Dahiya, now 85, had taught Justice Kant English in undergraduate course at Govt College, Hisar.Incidentally, Hisar was the first town he ever visited. Also among Justice Kant's guests were two professors - Ranvir Singh, the founding vice-chancellor of National Law University Delhi (NLUD) and K P S Mahalwar, who teaches at NLUD - who taught him law when he was a student of Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak. He got his law degree in 1984. Justice Kant touched the feet of his elders and teachers both before and after taking the oath.Kant's parents are no more, but his nonagenarian father-in-law and octogenarian mother-in-law were present on the occasion. Also in attendance were scores of his late father's friends, eager to share the proud moment for their 'boy' at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. His childhood friends, and relatives swelled the numbers.It hardly needs to be pointed out that for an overwhelming majority of the guests, this was their first brush with the grandeur and razzmatazz of a Rashtrapati Bhawan ceremony. The Rashtrapati Bhavan was kind enough to arrange seating facilities for all my guests, Justice Kant remarked.Monday's was the biggest-ever gathering of guests of a CJI at his oath ceremony and a testament to how relationships built in the hinterland decades ago stand the test of time.","President Droupadi Murmu administered the oath of office to Justice Surya Kant as the Chief Justice of India (CJI) He is the 53rd since the country became a Republic and the first from Haryana.

‘In memory of our brothers’: Russian Pilot's Heartfelt Note For Indian Tejas Pilot After Dubai Crash

NEW DELHI: Wing Commander Namansh Syal of the Indian Air Force was honoured with a ‘Missing Man’ manoeuvre by the Russian Knights aerobatics team after he was killed in a Tejas fighter jet crash at the Dubai Air Show on Friday.After the crash of the Indian Tejas fighter jet, the Russian Knights released a video of their performance at the Dubai Airshow 2025, paying tribute to the pilot and honouring the lives lost.In the video, shared on Russian social media platform VK, the team described the crash as “impossible to describe” and said their final-day performance was dedicated to the “memory of the brothers who did not return from the last flight”.At the air show, members of the US F-16 team also reacted strongly to the tragedy. Their pilot, Captain Taylor Hiester, said he was shocked that the event continued despite the fatal accident. The US team, along with a few others, chose to cancel their performance out of respect for the Indian pilot, his colleagues and his family.“After two years of doing this job, that was a first for our team and it came just before our final performance of the season.Together and individually, we all quietly watched the aftermath unfold from a distance thinking about the Indian maintenance crew standing on the ramp next to an empty parking spot, aircraft ladder laid on the ground, the pilot's belongings still in his rental car,” Hiester wrote as he headed back to the US.The Tejas aircraft was in the middle of an eight-minute aerobatic display when it suddenly lost altitude during what appeared to be a low-level manoeuvre. Visuals aired across several channels showed the jet diving toward the ground before erupting into flames, sending thick black smoke over Al Maktoum International Airport. Spectators, including families with children, watched in shock as emergency teams rushed to the scene.","Wing Commander Namansh Syal of the Indian Air Force was honoured with a ‘Missing Man’ manoeuvre by the Russian Knights aerobatics team.

Did Tom Brady just say the N-word live on air?

Tom Brady’s slip sparks reactions across social media





Tom Brady made an unfortunate mistake while calling the Dallas Cowboys vs. Philadelphia Eagles game on Sunday. It happened in the final minutes, when the tension of the NFC East clash had already gripped the stadium and viewers at home. While analyzing the sack on Jalen Hurts by Osa Odighizuwa, Brady stumbled over the name of Eagles lineman Landon Dickerson. The slip briefly created a moment of confusion before Brady immediately corrected himself and continued his commentary with calm professionalism.The seven-time Super Bowl champion is in his second season working in FOX’s lead booth with Kevin Burkhardt. In May 2022, FOX brought him in on a 10-year, 375 million dollar deal, making him the highest-paid sports commentator in history. The NFL initially placed certain limits on him due to his ownership stake with the Raiders, but this season those rules were “relaxed,” allowing him into production meetings and private player sessions that make the job more immersive.Tom Brady nearly had an unfortunate on-air slip-up while calling Sunday's game between the Dallas Cowboys and Philadelphia Eagles. As viewers replayed the moment, some wondered whether they had heard correctly. Brady was describing the sack when he said, ""Odighizuwa just blasted through Nicker,"" before swiftly adding, ""Excuse me, [Eagles guard] Landon Dickerson right there.""That instant was enough to light a match online. One viewer wrote, ""Sounds like Tom Brady said the infamous 'N' word,"" while another demanded, ""WHAT DID TOM BRADY JUST SAY?????"" Others quickly defended him, arguing it was nothing more than a verbal mix-up.One person clarified, ""He said 'Nicker-' as in Nickerson,"" and another noted how easy it is for a broadcaster to get tongue-tied during a live call, saying, ""He said nicker when going to say Landon Dickersons name he just got tongue tied yall blow everything outta proportion. ""Away from the chatter, Dallas Cowboys made a historic comeback, erasing a 21-point deficit in a dramatic 24-21 victory. Cowboys wideout George Pickens explained the turnaround, saying, ""I feel like the first half we were just a little bit sloppy, just shooting ourself in the foot."" Dak Prescott helped drive the rally, finishing with 354 passing yards and becoming the franchise’s all-time leader in fourth-quarter and overtime comebacks.For Tom Brady, the moment served as a reminder that live broadcasting demands precision. His legacy on the field is unquestioned, and that same credibility is what earned him the headset.Also Read: Nyier Daniels behind the bars as felony child cruelty and police evasion rock Georgia football program","Tom Brady made an unfortunate mistake while calling the Dallas Cowboys vs. Philadelphia Eagles game on Sunday.

Gisele Bündchen's shifting balance between support, career and self-fulfillment

Moving from high-stakes partnership to reinventing life on her own terms





In her March 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, how their lives evolved, and what she discovered in the space that followed. While details of their split had played out in headlines, Bündchen offered fresh context and a more nuanced perspective.Gisele Bündchen admitted that the marriage was “like a death and a rebirth,” and described her own shift from supporting a partner’s career to rediscovering her personal dreams. Her reflections reveal not just a high-profile breakup, but a woman reclaiming her voice and defining success on her own terms.When Gisele Bündchen first met Tom Brady at age 26, she said she was, “so ready” for family and partnership. Traditionally one of the world’s highest-earning models, Bündchen gradually scaled back her runway work after 2015 to support the family life they were building..Gisele Bündchen describes relocating to Tampa without ever having lived there before, “When we moved to Tampa, I actually had never been there before.I just arrived and that was my life.” Yet despite her enormous success, much of the public narrative painted her as “against football” or overshadowed by Brady’s career, a portrayal she calls “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”Gisele Bündchen underscores that marriage didn’t unravel overnight. “That takes years to happen.” As she puts it, “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart … When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are..”Gisele Bündchen's message: supporting someone doesn’t mean losing yourself, and that truth became clearer to her as her kids grew and her dreams quietly changed..Today, Gisele Bündchen speaks of her next act in Costa Rica, building a home, raising her children, and exploring wellness and nature far from red carpets. She asserts, “I have my own dreams..”While Tom Brady continued his historic career, Bündchen’s focus shifted inward. She embraced spiritual practices, daily rituals, and the idea that success is not just professional acclaim but authenticity and fulfillment. She says the breakup felt like both a loss and a liberation, “I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it’s beautiful to believe in that.”..Gisele Bündchen's reflection on Brady is remarkably gracious. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever … If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him.”In doing so, Gisele Bündchen rejects reductive headlines and stereotypes, choosing instead to present a fuller picture of love, change and self-discovery. As she said, “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It’s not so black and white.”In the end, this isn’t a story solely of one of fashion’s biggest icons, Gisele Bündchen stepping aside. It’s the story of a woman stepping forward, redefining when a chapter ends, a new one begins..Gisele Bündchen is back on the red carpet. The Brazilian supermodel made a rare event appearance at the Fashion Trust Arabia 2025 Awards Ceremony in Doha, Qatar, hosted over the weekend.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?","Supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady.

Why Dominguez and Jones May Be on the Move

Pros and Cons of the Potential Trades

Aspect Pros Cons Yankees



Gain lineup clarity, reduce logjam, acquire proven talent for playoffs



Risk losing future stars who could develop into cornerstone players



Dominguez/Jones



Better chance for MLB playing time and growth in new team environments



Uncertainty of adjustment and pressure of immediate impact



Trade partners



Obtain high-upside young talents at below-market costs



Development risks; prospects may not fulfill top potential





What Each Party Gains

The New York Yankees are heading into one of their most defining offseasons in years, with reports indicating they are prepared to commit $165 million to secure a major offensive upgrade. Whether that player is Cody Bellinger - capable of playing first base and designated hitter - or star outfielder Kyle Tucker, the move signals a decisive shift toward prioritizing veteran stability and postseason readiness. Such an investment reflects the Yankees’ determination to maximize their championship window immediately.Yet this anticipated signing has triggered a significant secondary storyline: the uncertain future of top prospects Jasson Dominguez and Spencer Jones. For years, the organization nurtured these two as potential franchise pillars. But with the outfield becoming increasingly congested, their paths to the majors may now be closing faster than expected.If the New York Yankees finalize this high-priced addition, they would enter 2026 with Aaron Judge, Trent Grisham, and their new star occupying outfield or DH roles. Given this roster construction, Dominguez and Jones might be squeezed out, prompting the team to consider trading one or both. MLB contenders frequently sacrifice young talent for established reliability, and the New York Yankees could follow suit by dealing these prospects to bolster their bullpen or address other depth concerns.Teams looking for controllable, high-upside outfielders - especially the Chicago Cubs or San Diego Padres - could become natural trade partners. These franchises may even connect to bigger trade rumors, such as scenarios involving Fernando Tatis Jr., with prospects acting as premium trade currency.Below is the full table based on the scenario:Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets could sign for $14.3 million Minnesota Twins All-Star to form deadly duo with Juan Soto For the New York Yankees, this approach simplifies roster construction around proven veterans while ensuring their $165 million investment delivers maximum value. For rebuilding or mid-tier teams, Dominguez and Jones offer enormous future potential at minimal financial cost. Dominguez posted a .257 average with 10 homers and 23 steals across 123 games in 2025, plus a .980 OPS after Tommy John surgery. Jones delivered a breakout minor league campaign with 35 home runs, 80 RBIs, 29 steals, and a .932 OPS, though his 179 strikeouts in 506 plate appearances remain a concern.",The New York Yankees are expected to sign Cody Bellinger or Kyle Tucker for $165 million.

Ciara believes Russell Wilson’s “fullness as a man” strengthens their relationship

Ciara’s Guide To Manifesting Convictions Into Reality | Angie Martinez IRL

Ciara and Russell Wilson have never shied away from expressing admiration for one another, but the singer’s latest reflections are offering fans one of the most intimate looks yet into their marriage. During a candid appearance on the “Angie Martinez IRL” podcast, Ciara spoke at length about the dynamic she shares with the New York Giants quarterback, especially their three-year age gap, something she says has only added depth to their connection.For Ciara, Wilson is not just younger on paper; he’s the emotional anchor in their marriage, someone whose “old soul” and grounded demeanor bring stability during the pressure-filled chaos of NFL life and fame.While discussing the early years of their relationship and the evolution of their bond, Ciara shared that Russell Wilson often feels more mature than she does, despite being younger. “I do like to live young,” she said. “And then obviously my husband’s younger than me too, so I gotta keep it here. He’s an old soul, to be honest with you, he might be a little more older than me.”Ciara further added, “Sometimes I feel his fullness as a man, and that feels good.”It’s a sentiment that mirrors what fans repeatedly see in their public exchanges; respect, partnership, and a deep emotional alignment.That admiration was on full display back in October when Ciara penned a heartfelt Instagram message thanking Wilson for a surprise birthday celebration. “Baby, thank you for always making me feel on top of the world and for throwing the best surprise birthday party!,” she wrote. “You always make every moment for me, big or small, feel special and important! You are the best!! I love you soooooo much.”The couple continues to shrug off online chatter, including the long-running “corny” label directed at Wilson. Ciara addressed that narrative months earlier on “The Breakfast Club,” responding with grace and conviction. “Why would I even respond to that, you know what I’m saying?” she said. “[He’s] the most amazing human being you can know… What you see with him is really who he is. So, it’s beautiful, it’s different. ”As the pair publicly embraces discussions about expanding their family, one thing remains clear is that Ciara sees Russell Wilson not just as her partner, but as the grounding force who brings consistency, love, and an unwavering sense of maturity into their life together.Also Read: Russell Wilson and Ciara celebrate a Hollywood milestone as their first major film breaks into the year’s top 100","Ciara revealed on the 'Angie Martinez IRL' podcast that her husband, Russell Wilson, acts as an emotional anchor in their marriage.

After the game, head coach Raheem Morris said that tests showed a PCL sprain, and he called Drake London a “week-to-week” player. This means the team must check him every few days to see how he feels.The Falcons also lost their starting quarterback Michael Penix Jr., who suffered a partially torn ACL in the same game and has been ruled out for the rest of the season. This puts even more pressure on the team as they move toward Week 13, and fans want to know if Drake London will return on time.NFL Network reporter Tom Pelissero said on Monday, November 18, 2025, that Drake London’s PCL injury can be “tricky” and needs careful rest.He also explained that if the Falcons fall further in the playoff race, the team may use a safer plan and wait longer before bringing London back.Pelissero did not say it directly, but this could even mean holding him out for more than one game if needed.Raheem Morris also shared a clear update when he said, “You never know, Drake could come back tomorrow and feel a lot better, but we will see how his knee reacts.”His comment shows that the Falcons are not sure yet, and they will watch London closely this week.His Week 13 condition will be best indicated by the Falcons' first injury report, which will be released on Wednesday in Atlanta.Drake This year, London has been among the most crucial players for the team. He was a vital element of the passing offense and had impressive stats before his injuries.Should London not be ready for Week 13, the Falcons could depend more on Kirk Cousins, Kyle Pitts, Bijan Robinson, and Darnell Mooney now without Michael Penix Jr.Drake London is not expected to play in Week 13 based on all the reports from Tom Pelissero and Raheem Morris unless he shows remarkable development really quickly. The team will wait, watch, and pick the most secure plan for him.Also Read: Madison Beer Opens Up About The Style Glow-Up She Discovered After Dating Justin Herbert","Drake London hurt his knee on Sunday, November 17, 2025, during the Atlanta Falcons game in Atlanta against the Carolina Panthers.

Candace Owens On Feminism, Zionism, Who Assassinated Charlie Kirk?





Candace Owens claims Charlie Kirk sent a very scary text message the day before he died. She says Charlie Kirk told a Turning Point USA worker, “They are going to kill me.” She said this message was sent just one day before he was shot on September 10 at an event in Utah.

Owens also said Charlie Kirk’s views were changing right before his death and that things around him felt tense. She says he told Tucker Carlson to “go max,” and she believes many people around him were upset about it. Her statements have now created a big debate online.On the podcast, Myron Gaines asked Candace Owens who she thought was “most responsible” for what happened to Charlie Kirk. She said his death did not feel simple and that she believed something bigger was happening. Owens said that one Turning Point USA staff member has the text message from Charlie Kirk where he wrote, “They are going to kill me.”She said this message was not about the trans lobby. She did not name the person who received the text.She said she did not understand why the staff member never shared the warning with the public.Candace Owens also said she did not like how Turning Point USA was acting after Charlie Kirk’s death.

She also said she sees what she calls “faith infiltration” inside Turning Point USA. She believes some people got close to Kirk on purpose.Candace Owens also claimed that an Egyptian military plane was sitting at an airport near the event on the day Charlie Kirk was shot.

She even led her team to win their first gold medal at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996. The book is a documentation of her journey in learning patience and developing resilience, the two most important things in sports.In a recent interview, Caitlin Clark was asked about her greatest source of inspiration.It took no time for the athlete to reveal her favorite source of inspiration. Clark, while making the revelation, stated, “My favorite book growing up. It was like ‘Winners Never Quit.’ This picture book and it was about Mia Hamm.”She went on to explain how the book played a major role in her life. Caitlin further added, “And I remember like when I used to read books before I went to bed with my parents, that was the one I always wanted to pick. The resilience she had, that’s the whole story of the book. And what USA Women's soccer did for not only athletes but women in general and how they brought about people together. Like that’s just has been her ability, it’s just really to inspire people and to give back. And I don’t think I would be her if it wasn’t for them.” Clark credited all her career success to Mia and the USA Women’s soccer team.Mia was overwhelmed by listening to Clark’s statement. She responded to the clip, saying, “First and foremost, you see how sports kind of connect everyone, and I am very honored and humbled because I am a huge fan of hers. Just to see what she has been able to do in such a short amount of time with the attention and high level of expectations.” Mia further added, “She has created that for herself. So, I feel very honored and excited to continue to see her grow as an athlete. ”It seems like both Caitlin Clark and Mia Hamm have had an influence on each other.

Kylie Kelce says Jason Kelce’s confidence ‘makes me mad’ after his viral podcast answer

Jason Kelce’s viral moments keep following the couple, and Kylie keeps talking about them

Kylie Kelce went viral this week after a simple question on her podcast turned into a marriage moment that fans can’t stop replaying. The former field hockey player tried a TikTok prank on her husband, retired Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, and his reaction didn’t just shut the prank down, it irritated her for a reason she didn’t bother hiding.The clip aired on the Nov. 20 episode of her podcast “Not Gonna Lie,” where Kylie tested a trend that usually puts partners on the defensive. Jason didn’t bite. And Kylie wasn’t thrilled that the confidence was completely genuine.Kylie called Jason during the taping and dropped the trend’s signature question: “Do you ever wish you were more athletic?”Jason didn’t hesitate. “Oh gosh, not really. I feel like I’m pretty athletic,” he said.Kylie kept the bit going, but Jason quickly realized he was on-air. Then he doubled down and answered again, this time even more direct.“I don’t know. I feel like sometimes I’m so athletic it’s a burden to carry. I wish that the expectation was lower, you know what I mean?”The call ended, and that’s when Kylie let the audience in on how she really felt.“He was just like, ‘No, I’m good. I’m really f**ing athletic.’* And he’s not lying, that’s the part that makes me mad,” she said on the show.“We’ve got to figure out how we’re going to knock him down a few notches. And I mean that in a loving way. Because that’s part of my job.”The frustration wasn’t real anger. It was the kind of irritation that comes from knowing the other person didn’t fall for the prank because the answer was too honest to mock.And that was the part she couldn’t get over.This prank wasn’t the first time Kylie dissected her husband’s behavior on the podcast. Earlier in the same episode, she roasted a “Smells Like Jason Kelce” candle and joked about fans needing her permission to even sniff it.She also recently reacted to Jason’s now-famous Speedo moment from his summer charity event. The former center stripped down to a patriotic swimsuit for the Eagles Autism Foundation, something Kylie admitted she did not enjoy watching online later.“I did not like that you just [were like], ‘Hey world, here’s my t-int.’ It’s mine,” she said, keeping the same deadpan delivery fans love from her.Jason had told his brother Travis Kelce on “New Heights” that he needed a wax before the Speedo reveal and described being told to “assume the butterfly position.”“I am filleted open,” he joked.Between viral stunts, parenting four kids, and two wildly successful podcasts, Jason and Kylie have become one of football’s most-watched couples, and Kylie’s honesty about all of it is why clips like this one explode instantly.","Kylie Kelce tried a TikTok prank on her husband, retired Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce.

Giannis' Impact on the Milwaukee Bucks’ Recent Performance

Milwaukee Bucks vs Portland Trail Blazers Game Details (November 24, 2025)

as the team prepares to face the Portland Trail Blazers. The two-time MVP continues to recover from a left adductor strain, an injury that has forced him to miss multiple games and is expected to keep him sidelined for at least one to two weeks. His absence comes at a time when the Bucks are desperate to regain momentum after a shaky run of performances.The situation has placed added pressure on Milwaukee’s supporting cast, who now face the challenge of competing without their most dominant scorer, rebounder, and playmaker. With the season still in an early but crucial phase, each missed game carries extra weight, especially when the team is already battling inconsistency.Giannis Antetokounmpo suffered a low-grade strain in his left groin, specifically involving the adductor muscle group responsible for balance, lateral movement, and driving force. The injury occurred earlier in the season and has already ruled him out of several games. The Milwaukee Bucks’ medical staff is moving cautiously, prioritizing long-term durability over a quick return, especially given how easily groin strains can worsen if not fully healed.The injury has also kept him out of recent matchups, including losses to the Detroit Pistons and the Philadelphia 76ers. Milwaukee has emphasized careful load management in hopes of avoiding setbacks, signaling that Giannis will only return once he is medically cleared and pain-free.Without their superstar, the Milwaukee Bucks have struggled on both ends of the floor. Milwaukee currently sits at 8-9, a reflection of the challenges they’ve faced adjusting without Giannis Antetokounmpo’s 31.2 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game. The absence of his interior scoring and defensive presence has been evident, especially in the 129-116 loss to Detroit and the overtime defeat against Philadelphia.Role players like Ryan Rollins and Bobby Portis have stepped up in extended minutes, but the production gap remains significant. The team continues to search for a reliable offensive rhythm, while defensive lapses have kept them from closing out tight games.Tonight’s game against the Trail Blazers, set for an 8:00 PM ET tip-off, presents another challenge. Portland is dealing with its own injury issues but still enters the matchup with momentum after edging out Golden State. For Milwaukee, this game is an opportunity to halt their losing streak and regain stability while their franchise cornerstone remains unavailable.","Giannis Antetokounmpo will miss tonight's game against the Portland Trail Blazers due to a left adductor strain, expected to sideline him for one to two weeks.

Darryl Strawberry recalls his phone call with Donald Trump after the $502,043 tax case and drug charges

Darryl Strawberry opened up about a big moment in his life on Sunday, when he spoke at a church in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The former New York Mets star thanked Donald Trump for giving him a full pardon for his old legal cases. The pardon was signed on November 7, and Darryl Strawberry said it changed his life in a way he never expected.During the sermon, Darryl Strawberry told the crowd that the pardon felt like a fresh start after many hard years. He said God helped him through the moment and gave credit to Donald Trump for taking action when others did not. His words came as he talked about his past, his family, and his faith in front of the church members.Darryl Strawberry had many legal problems during the second half of his MLB career. In 1994, he faced a tax evasion case for not reporting $502,043 in earnings. He received two years of probation and six months of house confinement.Donald Trump erased that record with a full presidential pardon twenty-one years later, on November 7.“God just completely set me free when he gave me a pardon from President Donald J. Trump,” Darryl Strawberry stated during the sermon.He further claimed past presidents had opportunities but no one responded.In 1999, he was charged with drug and prostitution-related crimes; this was among his other legal problems.He was given twenty-one months of community service and probation. He served 18 months in prison in 2002 for violating his probation and several rules at a rehabilitation center.According to Darryl Strawberry, these years were the worst of his life. Meeting Tracy, his wife, at a drug rehabilitation conference in 2005 changed the course of his life for the better.The pair next became ministers; both held the same Christian convictions. Officially ordained in 2024, Darryl Strawberry stated that faith changed his life.He also discussed on Sunday the early morning call he got from Donald Trump on November 6. He told The Associated Press, “We just talked about my baseball career in the 1980s… he joked that he could not hit a baseball.”Darryl Strawberry said the president then told him, “You did some very bad things, but today you are clean. I am wiping everything out.”Darryl Strawberry won the World Series with the New York Mets in 1986 and with the New York Yankees in 1998 and 1999. His No. 18 is retired by the Mets, and he entered their Hall of Fame in 2010.Also Read: Sabrina Carpenter Stuns Los Angeles Crowd As She Proudly Wears Los Angeles Dodgers Jersey During Huge Tour Show","Darryl Strawberry had many legal problems during the second half of his MLB career.

And I think also like when I do have free time, one of my escapes is like cooking a healthy meal for myself. Whether that's, you know, breakfast, lunch or dinner. Like I really do enjoy that just putting on music and making a home cooked meal. And I think that's because it feels like a safe place for myself 'cause that's kind of what I grew up on. ”Caitlin Clark is one of the most renowned faces in the WNBA league currently.

Jake Paul pushes back against questions over the fight’s credibility

Weight rules and reputational risks heighten the stakes for Anthony Joshua

Jake Paul has responded to the doubts that have emerged about his proposed fight with Anthony Joshua in December He insists the fight is real, and says the scepticism is just driving him on.The American content creator-turned-fighter feels such disparagement will vanish with the ringing of the bell, and insists hitting Joshua would mute the naysayers 'saying this fight could never happen.' He went on to say the skepticism surrounding the fight only helps make it interesting, and that he welcomes the pressure as he embarks on a career among the elite.Speculation hit a peak when fellow, young and brash, welterweight Ryan Garcia suggested the fight ""doesn't make sense"" because of Joshua's size and experience advantage. His response was blunt, pushing back hard against Garcia's recent credentials as a high-level judge of high-level boxing situations, and lecturing fans to consider facts only. He insisted the bout is set as a pro heavyweight fight, not an exhibition, and that he is training for it as the hardest test of his life.One of the main points of discussion is the weight cap he has to adhere to which will see Joshua capped at 245 pounds, a seldom applied restriction for a heavyweight of his kind.The regulation is meant to narrow the distance between the two fighters on foot, and has been embraced by some sections and faces backlash in others. It will be for eight three-minute rounds under traditional pro rules (including knockouts), and will be permanently recorded on the professional records of both fighters.However, observers are warning Joshua, an Olympic gold medallist and former unified world champion, could find his reputation in a heap of trouble if he has any losses. Paul is not the boxer Joshua is, but his upward trajectory has transformed a fight that many initially dismissed as a gimmick into one that people are genuinely interested in seeing. Many insiders now believe that the bout could carry far greater long-term consequences for both men than originally expected.Also Read: Saudi boxing chief makes tense Jake Paul statement moments after Anthony Joshua fight update","American content creator-turned-fighter pushes back against questions over the fight’s credibility.

Shedeur Sanders’ mother Pilar and sister Shelomi dress up as his biggest fans from the NFL crowd

More coverage on Shedeur Sanders:

In August, when Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders’ mother, Pilar Sanders, arrived at her son’s first NFL (preseason) game in a crop top and cargo pants, she instantly became the center of a social media storm. Critics unleashed a wave of harsh comments like, “Mom look like she in her 20s man” and “I would be embarrassed if my 60 year old mom was conducted herself like that,” as well as “Very inappropriate be a mom not a groupie” and “Looks like she’s auditioning for an X-rated movie. Not appropriate,” but what they missed was a mother whose fierce faith in her son never wavered, even as the world supposedly picked him apart for being the child of an NFL legend and for perceived entitlement. That steadfast support shone through in November, when her son surprised the world with his talent.Sanders took the field as the starting quarterback against the Las Vegas Raiders and mesmerized the crowd with a 66-yard touchdown pass to running back Dylan Sampson: his first ever in the NFL. He also threw a 52-yard deep ball in the first quarter, caught by rookie Isiah Bond, who celebrated his own first career touchdown.Even star defensive end Myles Garrett, fresh off three sacks, was left flabbergasted by the play. The Raiders never stood a chance, as the Browns claimed a thrilling 24-10 victory. Pilar Sanders was there for every moment, proudly sporting a striking, rookie-inspired portrait outfit.Pilar Sanders illuminated the stands in Cleveland’s signature orange and matte black. Her collared, buttoned orange jacket popped over a round-neck graphic crop top, which showcased a bold square full of innumerable small “12” numbers and a striking image of Shedeur Sanders in full Browns gear, football in hand, eyes scanning the field for his receiver. Another oversized “12” blazed in orange at the corner. Beneath, a hint of white spaghetti strap peeked out, paired with dark blue jeans. The jacket’s extra-long drawstrings nearly brushed her mid-thigh, adding a casual and sporty edge. Pilar’s look was finished with understated makeup, a sweep of pink gloss, dramatic kohl-lined eyes, chunky silver earrings, and a huge ring glistening on her finger. Her luscious black hair tumbled in loose curls. From the NFL stands, she cheered with pride, her joy for her son unmistakable.By Pilar’s side was her daughter, Shelomi Sanders, a college basketball player at Alabama A&M and a passionate advocate for Type 1 Diabetes awareness. Shelomi’s outfit was a tribute to her brother, practically screaming “Shedeur Sanders” with every detail. Her long black top was a collage of action shots of the Browns’ rookie quarterback in uniform, each image capturing his energy on the gridiron, with “SHEDEUR SANDERS” boldly stamped at the hem. She layered it over a fitted white long-sleeve top and paired it with pitch black jeans. Her look dazzled with massive diamond bracelets (shout out to the rookie!), two delicate silver chains, and matching rings. Shelomi’s hair was braided at the crown and cascaded in curls below. Like her mom, she kept her makeup subtle, just a touch of kohl and a glossy sheen on her lips. Together, the duo cheered from the stands, capturing their excitement in videos for their Instagram stories.","Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders’ mother, Pilar Sanders, wore a crop top to her son’s first NFL (preseason) game in August.

Why Lukas Reichel and Brad Lambert are drawing trade attention

Breaking News: NHL Trade - Blackhawks Trade Lukas Reichel to Canucks

This week, the NHL rumor mill is heating up with the trade speculation surrounding three young forwards- Andrei Svechnikov, Lukas Reichel, and Brad Lambert. Despite being in different developmental stages, the three of them are connected by one common issue: not knowing what roles or where they will be in the future. Quiet murmurs have rapidly turned into loud discussions as teams are trying to upgrade their rosters, and insiders are referring to frustrations, delays in progress, and potential shifts.Traditionally, the biggest talk of the town goes to Andrei Svechnikov, whose disappointing start to the season made the Carolina team think twice about him. The 25-year-old, according to Sportsnet reporter Elliotte Friedman, was dissatisfied with the reduced playing time, leading to multiple teams making inquiries as soon as the rumors began. The Hurricanes still consider him a key player and would only entertain what Friedman described as a “monster offer. ” After he moved back to the first line, he managed to score 12 times in 14 matches, which made the worries surrounding him a little lighter — still, the whole thing is one to keep an eye on.Winger Lukas Reichel, who is viewed in Vancouver as one of the main trade assets, could be available once more due to his inability to act accordingly.Rick Dhaliwal of CHEK-TV says that the Canucks might be open to trade if another team expresses interest. Reichel, who is only 23 years old, has one point in 13 games and has not played in some of the recent games. Teddy Blueger and Nils Höglander are close to returning, so their spots on the team are not at all secure.At the same time, Winnipeg Jets' prospect Brad Lambert has been given a chance to talk to other teams, as per a report by the insider Frank Seravalli. The player, who was once a very promising first-round talent, now only has one goal in a limited amount of NHL games and might really need a change of scenery—particularly since a number of teams are looking for centers.It’s that time of the year again when injuries rise, and the front offices start to evaluate their teams and players, keeping all the above-mentioned players right in the middle of the trade talks. Whether or not a move is made now or later, the trade buzz around Svechnikov, Reichel, and Lambert is not going away anytime soon.Also Read: NHL trade rumors: Pavel Mintyukov buzz heats up as Canadiens Montreal explore their options","Andrei Svechnikov, Lukas Reichel, and Brad Lambert are all being mentioned in NHL trade rumors.

What Kirill Marchenko's uncertain status means for Columbus Blue Jackets' lines

Kirill Marchenko (#86) All 31 Goals of the 2024-25 NHL Season

The uncertainty regarding Kirill Marchenko’s health is the major concern and the main topic of the Columbus Blue Jackets vs. Washington Capitals encounter on Monday, November 24, slated for 7 p.m. ET at Capital One Arena and streamed live on ESPN+ and Fubo. With just one point separating the Blue Jackets from the Capitals in the standings, the emphasis going into the game is not on the standings or form - it is on the availability of the top scorer of Columbus.Marchenko, the Columbus player with the most points, 22 points in 22 games, left the skating session early today, turning the spotlight on his status. His participation has a huge impact on the team’s offense, power play, and overall/team morale when they play away from home, hence the importance of this update for fans and analysts keeping with the match-up teams.The coach, Dean Evason, has said that Marchenko is “still being evaluated” after he apparently got injured halfway through the morning skate. No details have been given about the issue, so the situation is still up in the air. Evason mentioned that the team would have to evaluate him more before making a decision on whether he will play; thus, he is really a game-time decision.If he’s not in uniform, Columbus is likely to turn to Zach Aston-Reese for the spot in the lineup, while Yegor Chinakhov is going to skate on the first line with Dmitri Voronkov and Adam Fantilli.The Blue Jackets have leaned a lot on Marchenko's scoring prowess this season, and it would be a great impediment for them not to have him during the last segment of their road trip of four games.In contrast, Washington is entering the match with a severe home loss to Tampa Bay and will be seeking to bounce back. The Capitals are still relying on Tom Wilson and Alex Ovechkin for offense, while Logan Thompson, the goaltender, who was pulled out of the game early in his last start, is hoping to start over.Even as the puck drop approaches, Marchenko’s situation is still in the spotlight. His being there or not being there could alter the game’s dynamics, thus making tonight's choice a crucial narrative in this divisional battle.Also Read: NHL Trade Buzz: Ottawa Senators pursue top-six forward as Vancouver Canucks move Lukas Reichel and San Jose Sharks prepare major roster changes",Kirill Marchenko left the Columbus Blue Jackets' morning skate early.

The Patriots won 26-20, but the loss of their starting left tackle quickly became the main story of the night.On Monday morning, head coach Mike Vrabel spoke on The Greg Hill Show and said he does not expect Will Campbell to play on Monday night against the New York Giants. Vrabel called it “not a great day” for injuries and shared that Campbell may need “more than a week or two” to heal. His update made it clear that the Patriots could be without Campbell for multiple games.Will Campbell was injured late in the third quarter when his knee bent awkwardly during a running play. He had a towel over his head while being carted off, which often points to a serious injury.On Monday, Mike Vrabel explained that the team is still waiting for full medical tests but warned that the injury “doesn’t look like something he can come back from quickly.”The Patriots have not placed him on injured reserve yet, but that move could happen if doctors say he will miss at least four games.Campbell was not the only offensive lineman hurt on Sunday. Starting left guard Jared Wilson also exited the game after injuring his ankle.He was later seen walking with a boot, and his status for Monday night is also uncertain. If both Will Campbell and Jared Wilson are out, the Patriots may need Vederian Lowe at left tackle and Ben Brown at left guard.While both filled in throughout the Bengals game, changing two points on the same side of the line might have an impact on protection and timing.With an AFC-best 10–2 record, the Patriots start Week 13. Steady blocking and a powerful run game have been key factors in their success, and Will Campbell has begun every game at left tackle this year.His absence compels the team to change. New England might have to utilize faster throws, add more blocking support, or move more plays to the right side.Though for the moment Will Campbell is regarded as week-to-week as the Patriots prepare to meet the New York Giants on Monday night, Mike Vrabel said he hopes the injury is not season-ending.Also Read: Is Drake London Playing In Week 13 Vs The Jets?

How are Vancouver Canucks, Calgary Flames, and Edmonton Oilers shaping NHL trade talks?

Growing Concern Around Canadian Teams | 32 Thoughts

Once more, the NHL rumor mill is giving the Canadian teams the attention they deserve. The Vancouver Canucks have become the talk of the league due to the growing uncertainty surrounding Quinn Hughes, the Calgary Flames are attempting to keep the controversy they themselves ignited at a low simmer, and the Edmonton Oilers are getting ready for a roster evaluation that could be a major factor in their trade-deadline strategy. Key players have already been linked to the three franchises, thus the upcoming period could be critical for them all.As revealed by insider Elliotte Friedman on the 32 Thoughts Podcast, Vancouver Canucks management has decided to reorganize up to the top because of Hughes’ case. It is no more about a single player. The name of Conor Garland has appeared again, Kiefer Sherwood is still without a contract, and the Canucks are pondering whether to offer him a long-term deal or let him go in exchange for some immediate help. Their recent downturn — three back-to-back defeats and a 3-5-2 record in the last 10 games — has only made the situation more pressurizing. The Quebecers could be among the most active teams in the market if the talks with Hughes do not yield fruit.Elliotte Friedman has said that the Calgary Flames have, in a way, caused the trade rumors to arise unintentionally because of two interviews by Don Maloney, which generated a lot of online activity.However, amidst all this, nothing concrete in terms of trade offers currently exists. Even if the Flames decided to part with players like Nazem Kadri, Blake Coleman, MacKenzie Weegar, or Rasmus Andersson, they are not being compelled to do so by anything available in the market. The Foothills team is already in the process of a reorganization without declaring it, as it is depending on its prospects and waiting to see which, if any, of its veteran players will make a move request.In Edmonton, the Oilers are ready for what Pierre LeBrun describes as a thirty-game audit. The team is asking for a clear sample as it struggles with injuries to Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Kasperi Kapanen, Curtis Lazar, and others, before making big decisions. If there are no signs of improvement, candidates for the role of new players include Alex Tuch, Kiefer Sherwood, Anthony Mantha, and Mason Marchment.The Canucks are preparing for roster decisions, the Flames are dealing with unnecessary drama, and the Oilers are going through a very important evaluation phase. All three teams are making vital decisions, which means the rumor mill will continue to be buzzing.Also Read: NHL Trade Buzz: Ottawa Senators pursue top-six forward as Vancouver Canucks move Lukas Reichel and San Jose Sharks prepare major roster changes",The NHL rumor mill is giving the Canadian teams the attention they deserve.

Denver Nuggets Injury Report vs the Memphis Grizzlies (November 24, 2025)

Memphis Grizzlies Injury Report vs the Denver Nuggets (November 24, 2025)

Themeet on November 24, 2025, in a regular-season matchup that has gained attention not only for the teams involved but also for the extensive injury issues facing both sides. What was initially expected to be a marquee Western Conference clash has turned into a test of roster depth, adaptability, and coaching adjustments. Both teams enter the night dealing with key absences that could heavily influence the game’s pace, style, and outcome.As the teams prepare for this high-stakes showdown, the focus shifts toward how well they can compensate for missing talent and rely on the remaining healthy players to step up. The Denver Nuggets look to extend their dominance behind their MVP-caliber star, while the Grizzlies aim to stay competitive despite missing several major contributors. The injury narrative has become the driving storyline heading into the matchup, creating added intrigue for fans and analysts alike.Denver Nuggets is expected to be without several rotation pieces, placing increased pressure on their star players.Christian Braun remains sidelined due to a left ankle sprain, leaving a notable defensive gap on the wing. Aaron Gordon’s absence because of a hamstring strain adds to the complications, removing one of the team’s most versatile forwards who is projected to miss extended time. The Nuggets will also miss Julian Strawther, who is dealing with a lower back injury and has not been cleared for action.Despite these losses, Denver maintains a strong interior and offensive backbone thanks to Nikola Jokic. The reigning MVP candidate is averaging around 29 points, 13 rebounds, and 11 assists per game, continuing to dominate as the focal point of the offense. Jamal Murray’s production - roughly 22 points and 6 assists per contest - becomes even more essential, as Denver leans heavily on its star duo to stabilize the team through this injury-heavy period.Memphis Grizzlies enter the contest with an even longer injury list, highlighted by the continued absence of Ja Morant. The star guard is recovering from a calf injury expected to keep him out for at least two weeks, limiting the Grizzlies’ playmaking and offensive explosiveness. There is some cautious optimism surrounding Jaren Jackson Jr., who has missed the last two games with an ankle issue but could potentially return for this matchup, offering much-needed interior presence.Also read: Is Nikola Jokic playing tonight vs the Memphis Grizzlies? Latest update on the Denver Nuggets star's injury report (November 24, 2025) Additional injuries include Ty Jerome and Javon Small, both dealing with toe issues; Scotty Pippen Jr., also sidelined with a toe injury; and Brandon Clarke, out with a knee problem. With six injured players, Memphis Grizzlies face a significant depth challenge that will force heavy minutes from available rotation members.","Denver Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies meet on November 24, 2025, in a regular- season matchup that has gained attention not only for the teams involved but also for the extensive injury issues facing both sides.

Snoop Dogg requests Luka Doncic to share his pregame playlist during a candid conversation

Also Read:

In a recent episode of Access Hollywood, the American television program, Snoop Dogg got in a candid conversation with Luka Doncic. The duo talked about music in one of the segments. During the conversation, the American rapper asked about Luka’s favorite music genre. The response even brought in the context of the player’s preferred playlist before any game. It was at this point that the rapper made an adorable request to the NBA legend.As Luka talked about his favorite genre of music, Snoop Dogg got interested. The rapper wanted Luka to make a playlist for him. It seemed like the singer was really interested in knowing what basketball players listen to before entering any game. According to the discussion, Luka mostly listened to accordion music, which intrigued the rapper. Snoop Dogg even imitated the action that Luka would possibly do on the court while dunking and humming the tune that he had just listened to.The segment kicked off with Snoop Dogg giving a background context to his question. The rapper stated, “Normally when basketball players come out, with earphones on and what not, they have some sort of a musical ritual.” Snoop Dogg then continued to pose the question at Luka Doncic, “Is there anything that you listen to before the game?”The NBA legend took a moment and replied, “I mostly listen to music from my country.” Luka is from Slovenia. The 26-year-old proudly talked about the kind of music that comes from his country. Luka’s response amused Snoop Dogg. The next thing that came out of his mouth was, “I love that!” What followed was a series of candid interactions between the two as Luka proceeded to ask, “You love that music?”Snoop Dogg replied, “No, I love the fact that you are culturally into your music.Like you are not trying to like listen to rap or listen to this. You listen to what makes you.” Luka cut off the rapper in between and stated, “I listen to everything.” When Snoop Dogg asked specifically about the athlete’s preference before the game, Luka talked about how he would put on the speakers in the arena. Snoop Dogg was visibly amused and the next thing he wanted from Luka was to make him a playlist of the athlete’s favorite songs.“I need you to make me a playlist. Make me a playlist of some of your favorite songs. So that I know what’s in your head before you are out there playing.” Snoop Dogg requested Luka while imitating the athlete with a hum towards the end. Luka was not done revealing and his final revelation was about the kind of music he listened to. It was the accordion. Snoop Dogg could not hold back his excitement with this information and continued to imitate the sound of a musical instrument.",Snoop Dogg and Luka Doncic got in a candid conversation on Access Hollywood.

COMEY CASE IMPLODES: ‘Fatal' Grand Jury Twist; Trump DOJ Defends Lindsey Halligan After Big 'Error'

How this invalidated the Comey and Letitia James prosecutions



What the charges actually were



Why this ruling reshapes Trump’s strategy

What happens next







The two most politically charged prosecutions of the season — the cases against James Comey and Letitia James — ended not with a dramatic courtroom revelation, but with something far more fundamental: the prosecutor who brought them should never have been a prosecutor in the first place. In one ruling, a federal judge dismantled the legal foundation on which the indictments rested and forced the Justice Department to confront how it allowed an unlawfully appointed attorney to lead cases of this magnitude.Lindsey Halligan had been a familiar face in Trump’s orbit long before she became a headline. She worked in insurance litigation, later joined Trump’s legal team, and held a White House role. Before any of that, she even appeared in the Miss Colorado USA pageant — a detail that made for easy social-media fodder but had no bearing on the courtroom battle that followed. What mattered was that Halligan had never served as a federal prosecutor, and yet she was suddenly placed at the head of one of the most powerful prosecutorial offices in the country.Her appointment as interim US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia set off immediate debate, not because of her résumé, but because of the way she arrived in the job. A previous interim US attorney was pushed out, and Halligan was installed as a second interim replacement.That one administrative manoeuvre would unravel everything that came next.Federal law is clear: the attorney general may appoint only one interim US attorney before the role must be filled through Senate confirmation. The administration ignored that process entirely. By replacing one interim appointee with another, it bypassed the Senate, concentrated power in the hands of a loyalist, and turned a temporary exception into a revolving door.When the judge examined Halligan’s appointment, the conclusion was unavoidable. She had no lawful authority to hold the office, and therefore no authority to convene a grand jury, present evidence, or sign indictments. Everything she touched — including the Comey and Letitia James cases — collapsed instantly, because the law requires that prosecutors themselves must be legally installed before they can legally act.Halligan did not merely participate in the prosecutions; she was the prosecutions. She alone presented the cases. She alone signed the indictments. She alone drove them forward, pushing past internal resistance and capitalising on the urgency created by an expiring statute of limitations in the Comey case. When her role was declared illegitimate, the indictments themselves evaporated. There was no backup prosecutor, no co-signatory, no safeguard built into the process. Removing her meant removing the cases entirely.The judge did not weigh the evidence or the political implications. She simply ruled that the legal mechanism used to bring the charges had failed. Without a properly appointed prosecutor, there was no prosecution.James Comey was accused of giving false statements to Congress about media leaks during the FBI’s politically sensitive investigations. Letitia James was accused of mortgage-related fraud involving a Virginia property. Both figures are frequent critics of Donald Trump, which gave the prosecutions a political edge, but the judge avoided commenting on motive. The sole issue was whether the cases were brought by someone empowered to bring them at all.Trump’s broader effort to pursue high-profile adversaries depended heavily on speed, loyalty and tightly controlled decision-making. That strategy now faces a structural problem: if the administration bypasses the rules that govern prosecutorial appointments, any case built on such appointments collapses upon inspection. In this instance, the urgency to file charges, the removal of a reluctant interim US attorney, and the rushed installation of Halligan created a chain of events that could not withstand legal scrutiny.The judge’s decision is more than a setback; it is a warning about the consequences of treating the Justice Department as a political instrument rather than an independent institution governed by clear statutory limits.The cases were dismissed “without prejudice,” which means the Justice Department can attempt to refile them. But doing so requires a lawfully appointed or Senate-confirmed US attorney, a willing grand jury, and a viable statute of limitations — especially in Comey’s case, where the deadline has likely already passed. Even if the administration appeals, time and procedure now work against it.The immediate impact is simple: the prosecutions of James Comey and Letitia James no longer exist. The broader impact is more profound. A judge has reminded the administration that the law governs not only defendants, but prosecutors too — and that even the most ambitious retribution campaign cannot function outside the boundaries of appointment, authority and constitutional process.","Lindsey Halligan had no lawful authority to hold the office, and therefore no authority to convene a grand jury, present evidence, or sign indictments.

John Cena backs Tyrese Haliburton with a powerful 3-word message



Tyrese Haliburton shows progress as full recovery remains ahead



Tyrese Haliburton’s road back to the floor has drawn national attention, and this week it gained support from one of the most recognizable figures in sports entertainment. As the Indiana Pacers guard works through recovery from a torn Achilles tendon, his determined approach continues to resonate far beyond the NBA. John Cena , a longtime inspiration for Haliburton, added to that momentum with a simple but forceful message that captured both his brand and Haliburton’s mindset.The Pacers star has shown steady progress in recent weeks, even though the organization still expects him to miss the season. But every small leap, including a left-handed dunk during practice, has renewed optimism around his long-term return. His latest viral moment prompted Cena’s response.When Tyrese Haliburton’s practice dunk surfaced on social media, John Cena reposted the clip with a message that read: “#NeverGiveUp.” It was meaningful coming from a 17-time WWE Champion whose catchphrase has followed him for more than a decade. Haliburton has long admired Cena and the WWE, and the sentiment fit the guard’s approach as he continues to push through a difficult recovery.Their friendship has become a lighthearted thread in Haliburton’s rise.The All-Star even appeared at SummerSlam in August, where Cena taunted him before grabbing one of Haliburton’s crutches to use in a scripted scuffle with Cody Rhodes. It doubled as a playful heel turn from Cena and a fan-favorite moment for Haliburton, who has never hidden his love for professional wrestling.In recent comments, Tyrese Haliburton said he is “a little bit ahead” of schedule as he works his way back from the torn right Achilles tendon he suffered in Game 7 of the NBA Finals on June 22, 2025.He landed hard after driving to the basket and collapsed immediately, ending his postseason after a remarkable stretch of clutch performances.Achilles injuries typically require eight to ten months of recovery, and the Pacers announced in July that he would miss the entire 2025–26 campaign. Still, his one-foot dunk before the team’s matchup against Detroit offered a snapshot of how far he has come. It was equal parts encouraging and striking, especially for a player whose game relies heavily on agility and timing.Also Read: “It was just so silly"" - Megan Thee Stallion delivers candid testimony on Nicki Minaj’s ‘Big Foot’ diss and Drake’s alleged subliminal","Tyrese Haliburton has shown steady progress in his recovery from a torn Achilles tendon.
