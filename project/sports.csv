T20 World Cup | 'Our flight is booked and we are going' - Suryakumar Yadav on Pakistan's boycott

The impasse over the India-Pakistan T20 WC match showed no signs of being resolved, after Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif weighed in on the issue, calling their boycott of the February 15 match against India in Colombo an “appropriate decision”. It was a “considered stance” to support Bangladesh, he said.“We have taken a very clear stand on the T20 World Cup that we won’t play the match against India because there should be no politics on the sports field. We have taken a very considered stance, and we should completely stand by Bangladesh, and I think this is a very appropriate decision. We are with Bangladesh,” the PM said.Meanwhile, Bangladesh Youth and Sports Advisor Asif Nazrul acknowledged Sharif’s decision. “Thank you, Pakistan,” Nazrul wrote in a social media post.As the start of this contentious World Cup nears, speaking at a pre-tournament captain’s press conferences from two different locations – Mumbai’s BCCI headquarters and from Colombo — both teams’ captains broke their silence on the issue.“We haven’t refused to play against Pakistan. They have refused. The mindset is pretty clear. We have not said no, it has come from them,” India skipper Suryakumar Yadav said.“The ICC has given a fixture, BCCI and the (Indian) govt has decided with the ICC on playing at a neutral venue. Our flight is booked for Colombo and we are going,” he added.Salman Ali Agha, his Pakistani opposite number, said, “The India game is not in our control. It’s the govt’s and PCB’s decision and we respect that. Whatever they are going to say, we will do that.”“If we have to play them again in the semifinal or final, we will have to go back to them (govt) and act on their advice,” added the Pakistan skipper. The Indian captain acknowledged that the situation is “not easy” for those involved in the issue, including the ICC.“I feel it is not an easy job. It is not my call. I am sure they (the ICC) might be working out something as well but it has come from the other govt or the nation, how can they (the ICC) help as well? Their (Pakistan’s) decision is not in my control. I wish I could take their decisions, but then it is their call,” said Suryakumar.“We have been told that we have to play a game in Colombo on Feb 15th. We played them three times in the Asia Cup, we played some good cricket. We won (all the matches) and we were very happy. Similarly, if we get an opportunity in Colombo, we will definitely play,” he added.Earlier, Inter national Cricket Council (ICC) had expressed serious concerns over the Pakistan govt’s decision.“This position of selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule,” it had said. “This decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide.”","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif calls their boycott of the February 15 match against India in Colombo an “appropriate decision’ India captain Suryakumar Yadav: “The ICC has given a fixture, BCCI and the (Indian) govt has decided with the ICC on playing at a neutral venue”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127969189,imgsize-493153,width-400,resizemode-4/india-vs-pakistan.jpg"

GHAZIABAD: Three sisters, aged 16, 14 and 12, were found dead in the early hours of Wednesday after falling from the ninth floor of their apartment building in Ghaziabad, near Delhi.The girls were discovered lying next to each other on the premises of Bharat City residential complex, directly below a bedroom window of their flat. Police say all three died on the spot.A resident of the complex, Arun Kumar, told local media he witnessed the incident at around 2am while standing on his balcony in another tower.Also read: Inside the troubled Ghaziabad home: 2 marriages, wives leaving, no schooling for kids, mounting debts and more He said the eldest girl was seated on the window ledge with her back facing the compound, while the two younger girls stood in front of her, holding her tightly.“Suddenly, the girl on the window leaned back and fell. Within seconds, the other two jumped,” Kumar said. He added that he ran downstairs and repeatedly called for an ambulance, which arrived at around 3.15am.Police took the girls to hospital, where doctors declared them dead on arrival.1.45 am2.00 am3.15 amLater in the day‘Didn’t go to school, were lonely’According to investigators, the three sisters were sleeping with their mother in one room of the flat, while their father, Chetan Kumar , slept in another room with their son.“At around 1.45am, the girls woke up on the pretext of getting water,” said Nimish Patil, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Trans-Hindon). “They went instead to the puja room and locked it from inside.”Police say the girls used a plastic stool to climb up to the window. Their mother woke up and knocked on the door, asking them to open it, but received no response.Also read: ‘You made Devu like Bollywood’: Did rift over youngest sibling push 3 Korea-obsessed Ghaziabad sisters to brink? Patil said that, according to the father’s statement, when he later woke up, he found the eldest daughter lying in the compound below. The two younger girls also jumped shortly after.A police field unit later broke open the puja room door. Inside, officers found childhood photographs of the three sisters scattered across the floor, along with a mobile phone and a pocket-sized diary.Police said the girls had taken their mother’s mobile phone before entering the puja room. The phone has been sent for forensic examination.A one-page handwritten note addressed to their father was also recovered. The note contained an apology — “Sorry Papa” — and urged him to read their diary, with the words “READ NOW” written in capital letters.Police and family members say the diary offers insight into the girls’ state of mind.According to officers familiar with the investigation, the diary reveals a deep attachment to Korean popular culture, including K-pop music, television dramas and what is known as BL (boy love) content. The girls wrote that Korea had become central to their lives and expressed anger towards their father for opposing their interest.“How did you even dare to take this from us?” reads one line in the diary.Police sources say this may refer to an incident around 15 days earlier, when Kumar allegedly took away the elder daughter’s mobile phone and sold it.Police also said this could be a reference to their father Chetan Kumar, a stock trader allegedly deep in debt , taking away the elder daughter’s phone 15 days ago and selling it.He has not denied the girls’ interest in Korean culture. “They listened to Korean music, watched Korean films, dramas, web series and cartoons. They also wanted to go to Korea,” he said. “All three wanted us to accept Korean culture, but when we refused, their behaviour changed. They went into a shell and lived in their own world.”Investigators say the girls had not attended school since the Covid-19 pandemic and were not being homeschooled. They also did not play with other children in the housing society.Writings found on the wall of their room point to a sense of isolation. Phrases such as “I am very, very alone”, “My life is very very alone” and “Make me a heart of broken” were scribbled on the wall.According to police, the sisters spent nearly all their time together and appeared to have withdrawn from social life. In their diary, they referred to each other by names borrowed from television shows — Maria , Aliza and Cindy — and appeared to see themselves as living in a separate world.The diary lists 19 things the girls said their parents disapproved of, including Korean dramas and music, as well as Chinese, Japanese, Thai, American and British entertainment. They also mentioned cartoons such as Shin-chan and Doraemon, and several mobile games.“You don’t know how much we loved Korea,” the girls wrote. “The way we loved Korean actors and K-pop groups, we didn’t even love family members that much.”The diary also refers to tensions within the family involving a younger sibling, a four-year-old girl referred to as “Devu”.The sisters wrote that they wanted to introduce Devu to their interests, but that their parents objected and instead encouraged her to watch Bollywood films. This, they wrote, caused further distress.“You made her Bollywood, which we hated more than life itself,” the diary reads.There are also references to physical punishment, although it is unclear who the girls were referring to. “Did we live in this world to get beaten by you?” one line reads. “Death would be better for us than beatings.”Another passage mentions marriage, without detail. “The mention of marriage caused tension in our hearts,” the diary says.Police believe the diary may have been written by the 14-year-old sister and estimate it was penned one or two days before the incident, possibly after an argument with their father. It has been sent for forensic analysis.Police say the family’s circumstances were complex. Kumar lives with three women who are sisters and claims to have married all of them. The eldest of the three girls who died and a younger boy are from his first wife. The two younger girls who died were born to her younger sister. The four-year-old girl mentioned in the diary is the child of the youngest sister.Officers say two of Kumar’s partners left the house in May 2025, prompting him to file missing persons reports. They returned a few days later.Investigators say Kumar suffered financial losses during the Covid-19 period and took loans thereafter, adding to stress within the household.Police say there were frequent arguments in the family over the girls’ interests and lifestyle. No foul play has been suspected so far, but officers say the investigation is ongoing and forensic reports are awaited.“This is a tragic case involving children and a family under severe emotional and financial stress,” Patil said.","Three sisters, aged 16, 14 and 12, were found dead in the early hours of Wednesday after falling from the ninth floor of their apartment building in Ghaziabad, near Delhi.

After weeks of online speculation linking Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Cooper DeJean to WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella , DeJean finally spoke publicly about the situation. While appearing on The Pat McAfee Show, DeJean directly stated that he does not have a current romantic relationship despite the chatter. The whole conversation started after the two were seen at Eagles events in December 2025.The voices only grew louder after Bella appeared in Philadelphia again. But the story truly exploded this week when a viral Monday Night Raw clip put their names in the same headline once more. With fans chanting “Coop” during the Bella Twins’ segment, the NFL star was no longer able to avoid the question, which he did during the aforementioned appearance.DeJean was put on the spot with the question that was up in the air with all the rumors about him and Bella. However, he did not shy away from revealing what was true and provided a simple answer. When asked about the validity of the rumors by McAfee, DeJean bluntly admitted, “I don’t think I have a public relationship. ”That answer did not shut down the speculation, but it did make it clear that he is not ready to label anything for the public.DeJean faced the question again during an appearance on Up & Adams with Kay Adams. When Nikki’s name came up, he offered a softer answer: “I don’t know about that. She is a good friend.”Adams pressed him on the Bella’s Raw quote, but DeJean sidestepped, suggesting she could have been talking about anyone else. Bella has also avoided confirming anything about the whole situation. TMZ recently caught up with her in New York City, and she reportedly said she was still single.Before the DeJean-Bella rumors began, the cornerback was in a serious relationship with Steph Wilfawn, a former University of Iowa student.

"No Chiefs, No Taylor Swift: Is Super Bowl LX About To Expose the NFL’s Ratings Myth?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/no-chiefs-no-taylor-swift-is-super-bowl-lx-about-to-expose-the-nfls-ratings-myth/articleshow/127991305.cms,"NBC chases another Super Bowl ratings high without the Chiefs or Taylor Swift, leaning on Bad Bunny, Peacock, and record ad money.

Why Super Bowl LX May Fall Short of Another Ratings Record

NBC Is Chasing a Different Kind of Win With Ads, Streaming, and Bad Bunny

Super Bowl LX hits NBC on Feb. 8 with no Kansas City Chiefs and no Taylor Swift in sight. The NFL is chasing a fourth straight ratings record after last year’s Eagles-Chiefs matchup averaged 127.7 million viewers, fueled by Travis Kelce and Swift’s weekly storyline.This time the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks return to the big stage at Levi’s Stadium, with Bad Bunny at halftime and Peacock and Telemundo carrying the stream. It is still TV’s biggest night, but also a clean test of how much the league ever needed its most famous couple.Analysts cited by the Los Angeles Times say “record-setting seems unlikely,” noting that the Chiefs and Swift brought in casual fans who may not rush back for Patriots-Seahawks, Part II. Nielsen now counts out-of-home viewing and millions of connected TVs, and the audience is younger and more female. The structural boost is real, even if the sugar rush has cooled.Without the Chiefs’ built-in drama or Swift dropping viral moments from a suite, Sunday’s number will finally separate what came from new measurement and what came from celebrity.Even if the audience lands below 127.7 million, NBC is already winning where it matters.The network sold out Super Bowl LX ad inventory months ago at roughly $8 million per 30-second slot, with some hitting $10 million, plus separate Peacock-only buys bundled with this month’s Winter Olympics. If that package delivers record Super Bowl ad revenue while driving more people into Peacock and Telemundo, nobody will panic over a softer rating headline.The NFL has stood by Bad Bunny despite conservative backlash and a Turning Point USA “counter-show” with Kid Rock and country acts streaming elsewhere. Executives still remember the only counter-programming that really worked, Fox’s live “In Living Color” episode in 1992 that pushed them toward booking global stars.If NBC comes anywhere near last year’s viewership while cashing a bigger ad check, the night will still feel like a win in the rooms that matter. Super Bowl LX may not break the record, but it will show whether the NFL’s ratings machine runs on one superstar couple or on something bigger.",Super Bowl LX hits NBC on Feb. 8 with no Kansas City Chiefs and no Taylor Swift in sight.

The moment a Super Bowl promotion struck the wrong nerve



Super Bowl week always brings strange side stories, but this one didn’t come from a commercial teaser or a celebrity tweet. It surfaced quietly inside a company system, where employees noticed something unusual just days before the championship game. Actor Chris Hemsworth had briefly appeared on an internal organizational chart of Amazon, complete with a flashy title and a company email address. With the Super Bowl approaching and ad campaigns rolling out at full speed, the appearance was clearly tied to one of the game’s high-profile commercials. But inside the company, the reaction wasn’t laughter or excitement. It was confusion, frustration, and, for some, anger.Chris Hemsworth was listed as “Chief Heartthrob,” attached to a team connected to the technology featured in a Super Bowl ad. He was also labeled a bar raiser, a real internal designation usually reserved for employees involved in hiring decisions. The listing included a jokey quote attributed to him, as reported in Reuters. “When I’m not starring in movies, I enjoy spending time with my family, campaigning for Ad Meter votes, snake wrangling, bear wrestling, hammer throwing and a nice cinnamon scrub,” it read.The placement was part of a stunt tied to a Super Bowl commercial built around artificial intelligence. In the ad, Hemsworth imagines increasingly ridiculous scenarios involving an AI assistant, including being crushed by a garage door, drowning in his pool, and wrestling a bear sent after him. By the end, the assistant reassures him that it is ultimately a force for good. On television, it plays as dark humor. Inside the company, it landed differently.The moment came against a difficult backdrop. Recent layoffs at the company had affected thousands of corporate employees, including teams connected to the same technology being promoted in the ad. A disappointing earnings report had already shaken morale. For many employees, seeing a Hollywood star inserted into the org chart felt a bit out of touch.One employee wrote on an internal social platform, as per Reuters, “This definitely makes up for the hollow feeling of cleaning out my peer’s desk and meeting him out front with his boxes given he was laid off last week.” Another added, “It’s less of a joke than it is an insult to the rest of us.”By late Thursday, the moment was over. Hemsworth’s mock role was removed, and his profile was updated to report under a standard department head.","Chris Hemsworth was listed as “Chief Heartthrob,” attached to a team connected to the technology featured in a Super Bowl ad.

Dan Williams could be the next departure as Arizona targets the Chiefs’ quarterback staff

The Kansas City Chiefs are heading into a strange offseason, one that feels unfamiliar after years of stability. A 6-11 record and six straight losses to end the 2025 season knocked Kansas City out of the playoffs for the first time since 2014. Patrick Mahomes suffered a torn ACL midway through the month, ending his season early and putting his 2026 availability under real scrutiny.While some developments have happened, including the return of Eric Bieniemy as the OC, another vital member of the Chiefs may change outfits, as the Arizona Cardinals reportedly requested permission to interview Dan Williams for their open quarterbacks coach position. With Williams’ rich history with the Chiefs and the vulnerable position that the team is in currently, it will be a great loss if Williams takes up the gig.Popular NFL reporter Cameron Wolfe wrote on X, ""Arizona Cardinals have requested to interview Dan Williams for their QB coach position, per source. Williams is in Year 7 with Chiefs, the last 3 as assistant QB coach. A young rising coach and key figure for Patrick Mahomes with a chance for elevation.""Several members of Andy Reid’s staff left for new opportunities, breaking up a group that had been together through multiple deep playoff runs.The biggest move was offensive coordinator Matt Nagy leaving to take a job with the New York Giants. Regarding the latest news about Williams, it gets quite complicated if he makes the move.Williams has been with the Chiefs since 2019, starting as a coaching intern before steadily earning more responsibility. He later served as an assistant to the head coach, a role that put him close to Reid and the team’s inner workings. In 2023, Williams was promoted to assistant quarterbacks coach under quarterbacks coach David Girardi.If Williams leaves, it would be another hit to a Chiefs team that is already trying to rebuild confidence and consistency. Kansas City finished 30th in points per game and struggled to maintain rhythm once injuries piled up and execution slipped. The Chiefs were 6-5 late in the season and still alive in the playoff race before everything fell apart.","Arizona Cardinals reportedly want to interview Kansas City Chiefs assistant Dan Williams.

Kenneth Walker and rushing attack

Protect the football and rely on defense

Sam Darnold avoids interceptions and fumbles

Seattle Seahawks’ defense against Matthew Stafford

Seattle Seahawks star quarterback Sam Darnold said at a recent press conference that staying at the team hotel feels like training camp. He enjoys spending time with his teammates, eating snacks together, and moving in and out of the practice facility and locker room. In short, the signal caller is keeping himself relaxed and rejuvenated before Sunday’s final showdown against the New England Patriots.However, the Good Morning Football [GMFB] crew, Kyle Brandt, Jamie Erdahl, Manti Te’o, Seth Rollins , and Willie Colon, are analyzing whether the Seahawks will win Super Bowl 60 and offering valuable insights. With one of them saying, they expect a mistake-free performance from Darnold.Super Bowl XLIII champion Willie Colon says Seattle can win the Big Game if it runs the ball.Kenneth Walker and his rushing attack led the league in attempts. New England’s head coach, Mike Vrabel, has been saying that if they can’t stop the run game, they’re in trouble. The Seahawks’ running back accumulated 221 rushing attempts for 1,027 rushing yards and five rushing touchdowns in the 2025 season.Former Chicago Bears linebacker Manti Te’o thinks the Patriots are not given enough credit for stopping the run.Christian Barmore [Patriots’ defensive tackle] and company will make it tough to run against them. The Seahawks will win if they avoid turnovers and protect the ball. Seattle’s strength is its defense, so rely on it.WWE superstar Seth Rollins says Atlanta Falcons running back Bijan Robinson is the truth. Robinson shares that he couldn’t get through the interior line in New England [In Nov. 2025 game, the RB accumulated just 12 carries for 46 yards against the Patriots].Rollins hopes Kenneth Walker can keep going but thinks it will all come down to Sam Darnold throwing the ball.The quarterback throws down the field, uses weapons like [veteran wide receiver] Cooper Kupp. The Seahawks can win if they avoid mistakes. If Darnold doesn’t throw an interception, fumble, or hold onto the football for long, they can win the Super Bowl game.GMFB host Kyle Brandt says if Darnold throws a couple of picks, the Seahawks will likely lose.

What happened to Sam Darnold?

What this means for the Seahawks

As the Super Bowl LX approaches, all eyes are on the health of the Seattle Seahawks’ quarterback Sam Darnold. Seattle’s veteran signal-caller has been managing an oblique injury in recent weeks, but the latest updates are encouraging for Seahawks fans hoping to see him start in Sunday’s championship game against the New England Patriots.Darnold suffered the oblique injury on January 15, shortly before the divisional playoffs began. Despite the setback, he played through the pain in two crucial postseason victories and a dominant win over the San Francisco 49ers and a clutch performance against the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship Game.Throughout Super Bowl week, his status was closely monitored. After practicing in a limited role for much of the week, he finally logged a full practice on Thursday. This was the first time since the injury that he took every rep without restriction, a milestone that strongly suggests he will be ready for Sunday’s game.HC Mike Macdonald has also provided an optimistic update, indicating that Darnold appears to be on track and “ready to go” for the Super Bowl. Such comments offer reassurance that the Seahawks feel confident in their quarterback’s condition heading into the biggest game of the season.While full participation in practice doesn’t guarantee perfect performance, it does clear up any lingering doubts about Darnold’s availability. With kickoff scheduled for 6:30 p.m. ET at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, Seattle will want its leader at full strength. Darnold’s ability to throw, move in the pocket, and stay effective under pressure even with previous limitations has been a key factor in the team’s success this season.Seattle's strategy will probably depend on Darnold's experience and rhythm. He has been effective during the playoffs, and his leadership has helped the Seahawks get through tough times. He played at a high level in important games, even though he only practiced a little earlier in the week.While Darnold’s return to full practice is the most significant news, the Seahawks are also managing other minor issues. Rookie safety Nick Emmanwori sat out practice due to a low ankle sprain, but both he and the team remain optimistic about his availability for the Super Bowl.For now, the outlook is positive. With Darnold practicing fully and expressing confidence in his recovery, it looks likely that Seattle’s quarterback will take the field on Super Bowl Sunday ready to lead the Seahawks in their pursuit of the Lombardi Trophy.","Sam Darnold returned to full practice for the first time since suffering an oblique injury on January 15.

Travis Kelce celebrates Super Bowl week with music, style, and a Swift-inspired moment

Super Bowl week is always loud, busy, and full of late nights. Travis Kelce made sure his week followed the same vibe. Even without Taylor Swift by his side, her presence still filled the room. At a party in the Bay Area, the Kansas City Chiefs star was spotted smiling, dancing, and clearly enjoying himself as one of Swift’s most famous songs played from the DJ booth.Kelce had earlier attended the NFL Honors ceremony, where he was nominated for the Walter Payton Man of the Year award. He did not win, but that did not slow him down. A few hours later, he showed up relaxed and upbeat at the “Tight Ends and Friends” party. Phones were out. Music was loud. And Kelce looked like someone who was ready to enjoy the moment.A short video shared by the New Heights podcast X account showed Travis Kelce standing between DJs Andrew Fedyk and Joe De Pace, known together as Loud Luxury.The timing felt intentional. As soon as Kelce settled in near the booth, the DJs played a mashup that blended You Belong With Me by Taylor Swift with We Found Love, produced by Calvin Harris.The crowd reacted instantly, and Kelce leaned into the moment rather than stepping back.Kelce did not stay quiet or reserved. He clapped, moved with the beat, and helped keep the energy up around the stage.At one point, he pulled out his phone and recorded the scene himself, smiling as the music played. It felt less like a publicity moment and more like something he wanted to remember later.When the DJs switched to “The Fate of Ophelia,” Kelce stayed right there, nodding along and soaking in the atmosphere instead of heading back into the crowd.Earlier that evening, Kelce had already made headlines at the NFL Honors ceremony. He arrived wearing a bold suit paired with sunglasses, a look that quickly stood out among the more traditional outfits.That same confidence carried into the party later, where his mood stayed light and relaxed. According to TMZ Sports, Kelce has been out and about in the Bay Area throughout the week.The outlet spoke with him at his own event on Wednesday, where he joked about how much Garage Beer he expects to have at his wedding reception.As of Friday, Swift had not been spotted in the city, but with Super Bowl weekend still unfolding, fans continue to watch closely.","Travis Kelce was spotted dancing to Taylor Swift's You Belong With Me at a party in the Bay Area.

Former LIV Golf veteran Phil Mickelson credits all his success to Tiger Woods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/former-liv-golf-veteran-phil-mickelson-credits-all-his-success-to-tiger-woods/articleshow/127999426.cms,"Former LIV Golf veteran Phil Mickelson credits all his success to Tiger Woods

Phil Mickelson loses to Tiger Woods in the PGA Tour



Woods shot a lower round 19 times.



Mickelson shot lower 15 times.



They tied 4 times





Phil Mickelson says Tiger Woods's rivalry elevated him



The Tiger Woods vs. Phil Mickelson rivalry has dominated golf news for years. However, there’s a positive side as well, an inspirational one about how competition creates greatness. Former LIV golfer Pat Perez revealed how Woods not only outplayed Lefty, but he also transformed him into a Hall of Famer, as we all know now.“The intimidation factor that Tiger had is like nothing; you know, you might not see it again.” On February 5th, Perez stated on the Golf Subpar Podcast. “As great as Phil is, Tiger pushed him right here. He’s got 46 wins, six majors, and won one at 50.”They have 21 major titles and 127 PGA Tour victories between them. Mickelson’s last major came in 2021 when he won the PGA Championship at 50 years, 11 months, and 7 days, becoming the oldest major winner.Tiger Woods repeatedly defeated Mickelson by slim margins in their early pairings: 71 to 73, 68 to 75, and 72 to 71. Overall, in rounds where both played in the same group and faced off against each other on the PGA Tour, the following statistics are as follows:In 2007, Mickelson recruited Butch Harmon, a swing coach who had previously worked with Woods; he improved his fitness routine and sharpened his short game. The decision paid off immediately, as Lefty won his first Players Championship that spring.Mickelson was dubbed ""Tiger Slayer"" when he shot 64 to Woods' 75 at the 2012 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, an 11-stroke thumping victory. It wasn’t luck. It was the outcome of years spent responding to Woods’s game.“He owned me head-to-head until ’07. Over the course of my career, I believe that he pushed me to achieve a higher level of play,” Mickelson confirmed in 2015. It was more than just respect; it was recognition that the power of one rival had influenced his entire professional path.At the 2017 PGA Championship, five years later, Mickelson showed the extent of Woods's impact. “He forced everybody to work a little bit harder. He forced everybody to look at fitness as a big part of the game of golf, and I think that’s actually helped me with longevity,” Mickelson stated. “I don’t think I would have had the same level of success had he not come around.”Tiger Woods also helped Phil Mickelson extend his career by encouraging him to perform better. He even claimed that the 15x major winner pushed him to swing harder. Mickelson was not alone in feeling this. Ernie Els, who finished second to Woods multiple times in majors, echoed the sentiment.","Phil Mickelson credits all his success to Tiger Woods.

Sonny Jurgensen’s estimated net worth

Broadcasting career and other sources

The NFL world is mourning the loss of Sonny Jurgensen, who is one of the greatest pure passers in NFL history. The Hall of Fame quarterback passed away at the age of 91, As fans remember his achievements, many are also curious about his financial success and overall net worth.At the time of his passing, Jurgensen’s estimated net worth was around $2 million, according to a source . That number might not seem like much compared to today's superstar quarterbacks, but it was a lot during the time he played.Jurgensen built his wealth primarily through his long NFL career and later through broadcasting roles. Player salaries in the 1950s, 60s and early 70s were nowhere near today’s massive contracts. Even star quarterbacks earned significantly less than modern-day players.Still, he made the most of his opportunities by transitioning successfully into a second career in sports media after retiring from football.The Philadelphia Eagles picked Jurgensen in the 1957 NFL Draft. He later became a franchise icon with Washington. He was a four-time All-Pro and led the league in passing yards several times during his career. He was later inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which solidified his status as one of the best players in the history of the game.Although exact contract figures from his playing days are not publicly available, NFL salaries during that period were relatively modest. Many players even worked second jobs in the offseason. Jurgensen’s financial growth was steady rather than explosive, built on longevity and smart career moves.After retiring in 1974, Jurgensen moved into broadcasting. He worked with CBS and later became a longtime radio voice for Washington football. His broadcasting career lasted nearly four decades, adding stability and steady income to his post-playing life.In addition to broadcasting, he made money from endorsements and public appearances. He was a well-known and respected figure in sports for many years after he retired from football.His net worth may not be as high as that of current NFL stars. He concluded his career with more than 32,000 throwing yards and 255 touchdowns, which were remarkable numbers for his period. More importantly, he helped shape passing football into what it is today and had an impact on many quarterbacks throughout the years.","Sonny Jurgensen is one of the greatest pure passers in NFL history.

Boston Celtics strengthen roster with strategic Nikola Vucevic trade from Chicago Bulls

Nikola Vucevic brings experience and double-double power to Boston Celtics frontcourt

During this year's NBA trade deadline, the Boston Celtics traded a number of players, but they have also added a significant player in center. Nikola Vucevic, who will miss Wednesday's game against the Houston Rockets, has joined the team. The Bulls traded him to the Celtics, who then traded Anfernee Simons from the Celtics.The Celtics made three small trades before the 3 p.m. game after obtaining big man Nikola Vucevic and a second-round pick from the Chicago Bulls in exchange for guard Anfernee Simons. They have also sent Xavier Tillman to the Charlotte Hornets, Josh Minott to the Brooklyn Nets, and Chris Boucher to the Utah Jazz.After acquiring center Nikola Vucevic from the Chicago Bulls in exchange for guard Anfernee Simons, the Boston Celtics have added some depth to their front line for the postseason run. The Celtics acquired the talented big one day before the trade deadline, giving him a change of scenery after six seasons with the Bulls.Boston's tax burden will drop significantly as a result of the shift, from approximately $39 million to $17 million. The Celtics also have additional financial flexibility as part of the transaction, which they may use to make other deals. However, despite his Tuesday trade from Chicago to Boston, Vucevic isn't nearly ready to make his Celtics debut.Moreover, there was no mention of Vucevic in Boston's injury report that Celtics reporter Noa Dalzell issued on Friday. The omission of his name suggests that he will make his Celtics debut on Friday.The seasoned center will probably replace Neemias Queta in the starting lineup after he becomes comfortable with his new squad. Vucevic will possibly have his next opportunity to play against Miami on Friday. After this deal, Boston was a little shorthanded during Wednesday's game, but the fans could see the Celtics' newest roster in action on Friday against the Heat.Vucevic, a 35-year-old in his 15th season, is one of the most reliable double-double machines when he arrives in Boston. Vucevic has averaged 18.5 points and 10.5 rebounds a game during the past ten campaigns, officially recording double-doubles in eight of them.Vucevic is now joining his fourth franchise after playing for the Bulls, Philadelphia, and Orlando. Similar to his career averages of 17.2 points and 10.4 rebounds per game, he has averaged 16.9 points and 9.0 rebounds this season.With Xavier Tillman Sr., Luka Garza, and Neemias Queta making up Boston's center rotation, Vucevic joined a frontline that was lacking in experience. He has played in 1,020 regular-season games and 16 playoff games, including 10 with the Orlando Magic in 2018-20.Additionally, he has been with Chicago for the past five and a half seasons. He is now moving to Boston, where he will start at center right away. In 48 games this season, Vucevic has averaged 16.9 points, 9.0 rebounds, and 3.8 assists.","Boston Celtics acquired center Nikola Vucevic from the Chicago Bulls in exchange for guard Anfernee Simons.

New Kids on the block opened the pop music door

Gloria Estefan changed the language of the halftime show

Prince set the gold standard in the rain

Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake changed tv forever

Kendrick Lamar and Rihanna redefined modern halftime shows

The Super Bowl halftime show has slowly turned into one of the biggest moments in global entertainment. While football remains the heart of the night, millions now watch just to see what happens during those 13 minutes on stage. As Super Bowl LX approaches with Bad Bunny set to perform, it is worth looking back at the moments that shaped how halftime shows are viewed today. These performances were not just concerts. They changed rules, broke records, and reflected culture in real time.For many years, halftime shows were led by marching bands and safe performances. That pattern broke in 1991 when New Kids on the Block became the first major pop act to headline.The show included a children’s choir and songs aimed at a family audience. It was not widely praised, but it mattered.Donnie Wahlberg later told Playboy, “I don’t know how much pride I take in the actual performance. But I take pride in the fact that we were the first ones to do it.”In 1999, Gloria Estefan made history by becoming the first Spanish-language artist to headline a Super Bowl halftime show.According to ESPN, her Miami performance blended English and Spanish and reflected the city’s culture.Years later, speaking to E! News, Estefan advised Bad Bunny ahead of his halftime moment, saying, “Enjoy every second because it really goes by so fast.”Many critics still point to Prince's 2007 as the greatest halftime show ever. Performing during heavy rain, Prince closed with “Purple Rain,” creating a moment that felt unplanned and unforgettable. The Athletic later wrote that no performer before or after has matched the impact of that night.Not every moment brought praise. In 2004, Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake were involved in a wardrobe malfunction watched by more than 140 million viewers, according to The Guardian. The incident led to stricter broadcast rules and changed how live TV was handled for years.In 2025, Kendrick Lamar delivered the most-watched halftime show ever, with 133.5 million viewers, according to Billboard.Two years earlier, Rihanna stunned fans by performing an entire set while pregnant, suspended above the field. BuzzFeed News praised the show for its calm confidence and control.","The Super Bowl halftime show has slowly turned into one of the biggest moments in global entertainment.

How Roman Reigns and Galina Becker built their massive fortune

Inside the Roman Reigns Anoaʻi family assets and lifestyle

Leati Joseph Anoaʻi, better known as Roman Reigns, and his partner, Galina Becker, are now among the richest couples in professional wrestling. Reigns has gone from WWE prospect to the top man in the ring in ten years, a role that creates lucrative paychecks and international fame. Becker, an ex-college athlete and fitness model, has kept her own presence outside of the ring as well.Collectively, the duo has slowly accumulated a well-documented pot of gold that the media believes is worth up to $23 million in 2026. That figure reflects income from wrestling contracts, endorsements, business interests, and personal investments. Celebrity net worth figures are always debatable, and the combined bankability of Roman Reigns and Galina Becker is a testament to how wisely and proactively the two have handled opportunities beyond the ring.Roman Reigns has been a part of the WWE franchise for quite a long time, and that forms the basis of the household wealth. He is one of the most compensated performers in the company, meaning he has a guaranteed annual earnings plus match bonuses, merchandise royalties, and premium event payouts. Year after year, main event appearances in WrestleMania and other big shows where he fought have bolstered his income. His rise to mainstream fame has also uncovered new avenues, such as sponsorships, appearances in media, or even acting possibilities, which all add to his value.Taking the financial lead, if with less headline, is still the dark horse in Galina Becker. Becker, a former track and field athlete, has experience in fitness modeling and brand partnerships. Taelor has worked with lifestyle and wellness brands and has engaged in small side hustles that create independent income. Becker has also kept her own career, one of the factors that has given the couple's finances some stability, unlike many of the partners of celebrities. With a little top-tier athlete pay and business income on the side, the family has learned to have income streams available in case disaster strikes on any one front.More than the annual income, the couple’s portfolio includes hard assets and long-term brand equity. The family spends most of their time in Florida at their luxury home, planned for seclusion and comfort. They have plenty of luxury cars, travel, and personal investments in their portfolio, but the biggest asset is still Roman, a worldwide entertainment brand that will only continue to appreciate in value.Part of that reputation also comes from their Anoaʻi wrestling legacy. Roman Reigns is part of one of the most storied families in wrestling history, and that lineage adds to endorsement and merchandise appeal. Licensing deals and media opportunities, even when his in-ring career eventually comes to a halt, are sure to ensure cash flow.","Roman Reigns and Galina Becker are among the richest couples in professional wrestling.

Canadian men’s 2026 Olympic hockey team announcement | #CBCSports

As Canada's men's hockey team navigates pre-Olympic injuries with swift replacements, GM Doug Armstrong has recently opened up about the roster tweaks in the team. He has emphasized the flexibility of the lineup adjustments ahead of the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics. As reported by TSN, Team Canada has been forced to make significant changes just days before the Winter Olympic Games began.In an unfortunate situation, just a week back, the Tampa Bay Lightning forwards Anthony Cirelli and Brayden Point were forced off the team due to injury and were reportedly replaced by Florida Panthers’ Sam Bennett and Carolina Hurricanes winger Seth Jarvis. Meanwhile, General Manager Doug Armstrong said that replacing players was difficult, but he and the management group believe Bennett and Jarvis will be a great addition to the team. Canada's Olympic GM Doug Armstrong has shared a positive overview on bolstering the men's hockey team with Sam Bennett and Seth Jarvis as injury replacements, emphasizing seamless integration and depth. As Brayden Point and Anthony Cirelli were removed from the team due to injury, they were replaced by Sam Bennet and Seth Jarvis. In his recent discussions, Armstrong has stressed building a versatile roster capable of handling in-tournament injuries through a curated reserve list.According to the NHL, Seth Jarvis had an assist and played three of four games at the 4 Nations Face-Off, recording one assist. He has 25 goals and 18 assists with the Hurricanes this season. Bennett also had a very crucial tournament-clinching victory over the United States, as he scored the tying goal late in the second period that would set the stage for Connor McDavid’s overtime winner. Reports suggest that the forward has 19 goals and 42 points in 57 games with the Panthers this season.It is to be noted that 19 of Canada's 23 players from the 4 Nations Face-Off tournament are going to the Olympics, and much of the Canadian Olympic roster is similar to the one that won the 4 Nations Face-Off last February. As it stands, 19 of the 25-player roster headed to Milano-Cortina played on the 4 Nations roster. Macklin Celebrini, Bo Horvat, Nick Suzuki, Tom Wilson, Darcy Kuemper, and Logan Thompson are the only newcomers. Meanwhile, Canada will also have the same coaching staff, led by Jon Cooper.","Brayden Point and Anthony Cirelli were removed from the team due to injury, they were replaced by Sam Bennet and Seth Jarvis.

Why the trophy is named after Vince Lombardi

Vince Lombardi’s record explains the respect

What the Vince Lombardi Trophy is made of

What lifting the trophy means for players

Why the Super Bowl trophy still matters most

The Super Bowl does not really end when the clock hits zero. The night feels complete only when the winning team lifts the silver trophy in front of the world. That moment is what players dream about from their first day in the NFL. The Super Bowl Trophy is more than a prize. It stands for a full season of pain, pressure, and belief. Every tackle, every practice, and every risk leads to that lift. Officially called the Vince Lombardi Trophy, it carries the weight of football history. Only one team earns it each year, and no second chances exist. That is why this trophy matters more than any stat line or highlight clip. It marks the difference between a good season and a legendary one.The NFL named the trophy after Vince Lombardi because he changed how winning looked in football. Lombardi coached the Green Bay Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowls.After he passed away in 1970 following cancer, the league renamed the trophy in his honor. Since then, every champion lifts a trophy tied to his legacy.Lombardi’s success was not luck. He finished his NFL coaching career with a 96–34–6 regular-season record.In the playoffs, he lost just once.That standard still defines greatness today. His belief was simple: preparation decides everything. That idea still lives inside every Super Bowl locker room.The trophy is made completely of silver. It stands 22 inches tall and weighs about seven pounds. A football sits on top in kicking position, showing how every season begins.Each trophy costs around $50,000. According to the NFL, a brand-new trophy is created every year, and the winning team keeps it forever.For stars like Tom Brady, Patrick Mahomes, and Aaron Rodgers, lifting the trophy changed how their careers were remembered. One moment can turn a great player into a legend. That is the power of this trophy.In today’s NFL, money, fame, and records come quickly. But none of them replace the Super Bowl Trophy. It is the one thing every player wants, and most never touch. That reality keeps the trophy special every single year.","The NFL named the trophy after Vince Lombardi because he changed how winning looked in football.

What this game means entering the All-Star stretch

The New York Knicks visit Little Caesars Arena on Friday with a chance to strengthen their position near the top of the Eastern Conference. They arrive with several injuries that could affect rotations and minutes against a Detroit team that has been steady for most of the season.The Pistons hold the conference’s best record at 37-13 and have been consistent on both ends of the floor. Their injury list is shorter, but a few decisions before tipoff could still influence the matchup. With the All-Star break approaching, both teams are focused on seeding and maintaining form.Karl-Anthony Towns is unlikely to play, which would remove one of New York’s primary scoring options. Jalen Brunson is expected to handle a larger share of the offense if Towns sits. OG Anunoby’s status matters on defense, especially against Detroit’s wings. Josh Hart is expected to play and should help with rebounding and ball movement.Jalen Duren’s availability is the main concern for Detroit. His presence helps protect the rim and control rebounds. Tobias Harris and Duncan Robinson are both expected to play, giving Detroit stability in the rotation.Recent meetings have often been close, with several games decided late.New York has maintained a positive scoring margin this season. Brunson leads the offense, while Mitchell Robinson provides interior defense. Mikal Bridges has been active on the perimeter. If Towns does not play and Anunoby is limited, New York will rely more on guard play and defensive discipline.Detroit scores efficiently and defends at a high level. The team rebounds well and protects the paint. If Duren plays, that interior defense becomes stronger.A win for Detroit would help maintain its lead in the conference. For New York, a road win against the top seed would reduce the gap and show it can compete despite injuries.The Knicks are likely to depend on Brunson, Hart, Bridges, and Robinson, along with whoever fills Towns’ minutes. Detroit will try to use its defense and rebounding to control the pace.

Chemistry between young stars helped Switzerland weather the early storm in the Olympics



The opening game of Switzerland's Olympic campaign required grit, resilience, and contributions from veterans and newcomers alike. When the moment demanded excellence, two established stars delivered while a new generation announced its arrival on the sport's biggest stage.Alina Muller and Lara Stalder shifted momentum throughout the Group A thriller against Czechia on Friday. The duo consistently created offensive chances and provided the spark Switzerland needed to erase a two-goal deficit in the final period, even helping their team secure the win.With an early goal from Kristyna Kaltounkova, Team Czechia seized the game in their favor early, but the Swiss didn’t allow the lead to continue for long. Just minutes later, Laura Zimmerman slapped the puck inside the net to level the game.But the Czechs soon turned the game in their favor as goals by Natalie Mlynkova and Tereza Plosova put their team ahead 3-1 with minutes remaining on the clock. While a victory looked unachievable, Switzerland refused to concede.Muller scored a power-play goal 10 minutes into the third period, orchestrating a tic-tac-toe sequence with Stalder and Ivana Wey that cut the deficit to one.Defender Lara Christen then rifled home the tying goal with less than three minutes remaining in regulation to force overtime.The Swiss controlled possession through the three-on-three overtime period before the game went to a shootout.

Chicago Bulls vs Toronto Raptors Betting and Game Outlook (February 5, 2026)

Theon Thursday in a meeting between two teams trying to stay competitive in the Eastern Conference playoff race. Neither side has found sustained form this season, and both are dealing with roster changes that have affected continuity.This is an important game in which Chicago will be playing after multiple trades and injuries decided the rotation. On the other hand, Toronto is managing its own absences. With several regular contributors unavailable, this matchup is likely to depend on how each team deals with absences and rotation fillers rather than star power.The Chicago Bulls are adjusting to a roster that looks very different from earlier in the season.• Zach Collins - Right first-toe sprain• Ayo Dosunmu - Not with team (trade-related)• Noa Essengue - Recovering from left-shoulder surgery• Josh Giddey - Left hamstring strain• Tre Jones - Left hamstring strain• Julian Phillips - Not with team (trade-related)• Dalen Terry - Not with team (trade-related)• Nikola Vucevic - Not with team (trade-related)• Ousmane Dieng - Trade pending• Collin Sexton - Trade pendingProbable / Expected to Play• Jaden Ivey - ProbableChicago is expected to rely more on younger guards, and the frontcourt depth is limited.Toronto Raptors is also dealing with availability issues, particularly in the paint.• RJ Barrett - Managed right-knee sprain• Jakob Poeltl - Lower-back strain• Chucky Hepburn - G League assignment• A.J. Lawson - G League assignment• Ayo Dosunmu - Bilateral quad-tendon issue• Tre Jones - Left hamstring strainWithout Barrett and Poeltl, Toronto loses a primary scorer on the wing and its main rim protector. That places more responsibility on the backcourt.• Chicago Bulls - 4 wins• Toronto Raptors - 0 winsChicago has won each matchup by an average of about 7.5 points and has outscored Toronto by roughly 15 points per 100 possessions.• Total games: 110• Bulls wins: 61• Raptors wins: 49Chicago is 24-27, placing 10th in the East and third in the Central Division.• Points per game: ~117.2• Field-goal percentage: ~47.3%• Three-point percentage: ~36.8%• Turnovers: ~14.4Ball movement remains a strength, but the absence of Nikola Vucevic and the injury to Josh Giddey have shifted more creation to the perimeter.• Points allowed: ~120.2• Rebounds: ~45.3 (3rd in NBA)• Net rating: about -3.0The Bulls rebound well but have struggled defensively, especially around the rim and on perimeter rotations.Toronto is close to the .500 mark with results largely driven by defense.• Points per game: mid-110s• Three-point shooting: roughly 34-35%• Assists: just over 28The offense relies on pick-and-roll sets and transition scoring, but outside shooting and turnovers have limited efficiency.• Points allowed per 100 possessions: around 113-114• Net rating: slightly positiveToronto defends the perimeter effectively, though Poeltl’s absence reduces interior protection.With Giddey, Jones, and Collins out, Chicago will depend on Jaden Ivey and its remaining ball-handlers to attack the defense and create second-chance opportunities. The Bulls’ rebounding advantage could matter against a smaller Toronto lineup.Toronto is likely to push the pace and force contested shots. Defensive communication and help coverage will be important without a traditional interior anchor.Rebounding and second-chance points favor Chicago, while Toronto may attempt more three-pointers despite a lower percentage. Based on the season series and current injuries, the spread is expected to lean slightly toward the Bulls.Both teams enter the game dealing with lineup changes and missing players. Chicago has controlled the season series, but Toronto’s defense has kept games competitive. The result may come down to which team handles the rotation gaps more effectively and executes late in the game.","Chicago Bulls host Toronto Raptors on February 5, 2026. The Bulls are 24-27, placing 10th in the East and third in the Central Division. The Raptors have won just one of their last five games.

How a single vote cost Drake Maye the NFL MVP to Matthew Stafford,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/how-a-single-vote-cost-drake-maye-the-nfl-mvp-to-matthew-stafford/articleshow/128007901.cms,"Matthew Stafford (Getty Images)

Stafford’s MVP Win Defined by Heartfelt ""MVD"" Tribute from His Four Daughters

""To my four beautiful daughters... you guys are my 'why',""

The 5-Point Controversy: Was Drake Maye Robbed?

The ""Sam Monson"" Factor:

Value vs. Volume: Stafford had the ""volume"" (46 TDs), but Maye had the ""value,"" leading a rebuilding Patriots team to a 14-3 record with a significantly weaker supporting cast.

Efficiency: Maye led the league in completion percentage (72%) and passer rating (113.5).



The ""Super Bowl"" Irony: Fans were quick to point out that while Stafford was accepting a trophy, Maye was busy preparing to play in Super Bowl LX this Sunday.



Public and Celebrity Reaction: A Split Decision

The Legends: Tom Brady and Steve Young have been vocal in their support of Stafford, calling it a ""lifetime achievement"" win for a veteran who has finally earned his flowers.



The New Guard: Younger fans and analysts argue that the MVP award should go to the ""best player that year,"" not the player with the best story.

The Meme Wars: Today, February 7th, is Stafford's 38th birthday. Memes are already circulating of him ""stealing"" the trophy as a birthday gift from the voters.

On Thursday night at the NFL Honors, the league crowned Matthew Stafford as the MVP. But while the history books will record the 37-year-old Rams quarterback as the 2025 NFL MVP, the night was defined by a razor-thin voting margin and a surprise video that reminded everyone why he’s really playing.Before Stafford took the stage to accept his trophy, the room went quiet for a surprise video. In a clip that has since racked up millions of views, Stafford’s four daughters—Chandler, Sawyer, Hunter, and Tyler surprised their dad with a homemade tribute.They didn't talk about his league-leading 4,707 passing yards or his 46 touchdowns. Instead, they crowned him their ""MVD""—Most Valuable Dad. Stafford was visibly moved to tears, and when he finally took the stage, he was flanked by his daughters and his wife, Kelly.Stafford told the crowd. He then used the massive platform to put retirement rumors to bed, confirming he will return for the 2026 season.Despite the sentimental celebration, a storm was brewing on social media. Stafford won the award by just 5 points (366 to 361), the closest margin in 22 years.The debate centers on a single vote. Analyst Sam Monson revealed he used his first-place vote on Justin Herbert (who wasn't even a top-5 finalist).Because Maye lost by only 5 points, that one ""renegade"" vote effectively decided the race.Patriots fans and ""advanced stats"" enthusiasts are calling it a robbery, citing the following:The reaction has been a perfect reflection of the close vote:Matthew Stafford goes into the 2026 season with a Hall of Fame lock, an MVP trophy, and a title he clearly values more: Most Valuable Dad. But for Drake Maye, the 5-point snub might just be the fuel he needs to go from ""Runner-Up"" to ""Super Bowl Champion"" this Sunday.","Matthew Stafford was crowned the 2025 NFL MVP on Thursday night.

It made me feel like my looks were more important than what I had just accomplished…”Chloe Kim added, “As a young girl, that’s incredibly detrimental to my body image, my identity, everything. Growing up, I was so insecure about speaking Korean with my dad because I just hated that I was Asian and the way that I was being perceived by others.”The 25 year old popular Olympian continued, “I had essentially allowed public opinion to win in my eyes. I had never experienced hate in that way. So it was difficult.”While it took some time for Chloe Kim to get over the hate she received online, she never let it get in the way of her career.Despite the backlash, Chloe Kim worked hard on her skill and is now a two time Olympian at the age of just 25.Chloe Kim’s romance with the Cleveland Browns’ star player Myles Garrett has been pretty shocking even though the two had been rumored to be dating for a while.While the two seem to be deeply in love with each other, Chloe Kim recently admitted to TIME about how she is a “little scared” of how public their relationship is since her personal life was always private.Interestingly, Myles Garrett has stayed away from commenting on his high profile romance with Chloe Kim.","Chloe Kim opened up about the hate she received when she joined social media at 14 after winning her first X Games gold.

"""He’ll make his mark again"": Usain Bolt warns Ferrari fans not to expect a Lewis Hamilton title until at least 2027",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/formula-one/news/hell-make-his-mark-again-usain-bolt-warns-ferrari-fans-not-to-expect-a-lewis-hamilton-title-until-at-least-2027/articleshow/127989889.cms,"Usain Bolt, Lewis Hamilton (Image Source: Getty)

Usain Bolt believes Lewis Hamilton faces a difficult transition

“I believe it’s going to be quite a challenge for Lewis. I know what it’s like to fight your way back to the top.

That’s not without its ups and downs. So, I don’t think it will be easy for him. He’ll need another year or two to feel completely comfortable at Ferrari. I’m really looking forward to the next few years. I’m sure he’ll make his mark again.”

Why a Lewis Hamilton title push may have to wait until 2027

Remember that time when Lewis Hamilton shockingly switched to Ferrari? Fans say that it was one of the most dramatic moments in recent Formula 1 history. The seven-time World Champion stepped into the most dominant team in the sport with hopes of finally capturing an unprecedented eighth title. Immediately, fans across the globe imagined Hamilton leading the silence back to Maranello. But with this new partnership taking form, plenty of big-name observers have already been tempering expectations.One of those to issue a warning is sprinting legend Usain Bolt, no stranger to the Motormouth podcast himself, and a Hamilton fan for many years. The Jamaican, who is a seven-time world champion like Hamilton, believes the Briton will one day win at Ferrari, but he doubts that the journey back to the top will be quick or easy. Bolt believes the British driver may well have a sizeable transition period to endure before he can be seen as a genuine contender for a further title.As for Hamilton's move, Bolt stated matter-of-factly that he isn't bidding on a quick victory. Having dominated for years, he understands better than most how tough it can be for elite athletes to adapt to different circumstances.In an exclusive interview with RacingNews365, Bolt said,Bolt's comments indicate a growing view in motorsport that Hamilton's Ferrari project is more of a long-term play than a short-term solution. The team is still bridging the gap to its nearest competitors, and driving a different car in a new working environment takes time to adjust to, even for a driver of Hamilton's experience.Hamilton has already demonstrated with Ferrari in the early years of their rebuilding that a championship challenge does not come together overnight. While the car showed flashes of pace, making it consistent has proven more difficult. Ferrari is stuck in between a technical generation, while season after season, new regulation changes could shift the competitive order quicker than expected.The thinking among many analysts is that 2026 is the year that Hamilton's move to Ferrari becomes tangible, even if he and the Scuderia need that season to get to know each other perfectly. Only after laying that groundwork can a realistic title assault be attempted. Bolt therefore left the door open for the Briton needing another year or two, a line that suits that broader evaluation down to the ground.But while Hamilton is currently facing challenges, few would doubt his resolve or capability. He has shown he can restore a program to winning when he has the right pieces. However, for now, that message is just fine. Ferrari fans with fantasies of success taken from Hamilton on an ice tray are left dazed, while his victory may take too long to become new golden silverware, but Hamilton's next magnificent win with a trophy could be a little closer at hand.",Usain Bolt believes Lewis Hamilton faces a difficult transition at Ferrari.

Su Yiming opens up on his big dream of a full-length feature film on Snowboarding



Su Yiming has opened up on why snowboarding deserves a place on the big screen. The Chinese superstar feels Hollywood has not fully explored the sport’s storytelling power. Famous for winning big air gold and slopestyle silver at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, Su is more than just an athlete. He is also a former child actor. Now, he wants to mix both worlds and take snowboarding beyond short action films made only for core fans.Unlike traditional snowboarding movies, Su dreams of a full-length feature film. He imagines a movie driven by story, emotion, and real personalities from the sport. He believes snowboarding’s strong friendships and shared passion could translate well to cinema. With the Milano Cortina 2026 games set to begin, Su is again in the spotlight, not only for medals, but also for his vision to grow the sport worldwide.Speaking to the Olympics' official website , Su Yiming said most snowboarding films focus only on tricks and mountains. He feels there is space for something more meaningful. He wants a movie where top snowboarders act together and follow a clear storyline. According to Su, snowboarding is special because athletes support each other, train together, and celebrate progress as a group. He believes that balance of competition and friendship would connect with a wider audience.Su explained that he has always lived between acting and snowboarding. He wants to help make snowboarding a sport loved by people everywhere, not just fans who already follow it closely. In his view, film is a powerful way to grow that love.Before turning fully to snowboarding in 2018, Su was a well-known child actor in China. He features in many movies and TV shows. For one major role, he even learned skiing to fit the character. Those experiences, he says, helped him later as an athlete.Su says he learned not to chase wins alone. Feelings and excitement matter just as much. Looking ahead, his biggest goal is clear. He hopes to win one, or even two more Olympic gold medals in big air and slopestyle. As for who should play him in a future biopic, Su says passion matters more than fame. Any actor who truly loves life and their craft would make him happy.",Su Yiming has opened up on why snowboarding deserves a place on the big screen.

Travis Kelce loses major NFL honor as retirement rumors keep swirling around Chiefs star,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-kelce-loses-major-nfl-honor-as-retirement-rumors-keep-swirling-around-chiefs-star/articleshow/127989106.cms,"Travis Kelce (via Getty Images)

Why this award matters, and what Kelce’s silence could mean for Kansas City

The retirement rumors around Travis Kelce continue to swirl in addition to the excitement about his marriage to Taylor Swift. However, fans will be disappointed with how the tight end failed to win a prestigious award recently. The NFL officially announced one of its biggest yearly awards, where Kelce was selected by his team as its nominee for the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award, a recognition that carries real weight across the league.But when NFL Honors took center stage on Thursday, February 5, the award went to Washington Commanders linebacker Bobby Wagner instead. For Kelce and millions of his fans, it was a tough moment, especially for those still waiting and uncertain about his decision on whether he will return for another season.The Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award is not a typical trophy, as it is one of the league’s most respected honors because it recognizes both football excellence and impact away from the field. The award has been around since 1970 and is given to a player who stands out for leadership, charity work, and community service.According to the NFL, the winner receives “up to a $250,000 donation to the charity of his choice.”The league also supports every team nominee, with all 32 club winners receiving “up to a $40,000 donation to their charity of choice.” That support is a big reason why being nominated alone is considered a meaningful achievement.This year, the honor went to Wagner, a longtime leader and one of the most respected veterans in the sport. His acceptance speech was emotional and personal. Praising his dad, Bobby Sr., Wagner said, “I didn’t realize how hard it was to be a father until I got two kids of my own.” He also gave heartfelt credit to his mother, calling her “my rock,” and adding, “She’s the reason why I’m standing up here.”For Kelce, the timing is what makes this disappointing news hit harder. The Chiefs star has been linked to retirement talk for weeks, and he has not shut it down with a clear statement. On the January 7 episode of the New Heights podcast, Kelce explained his mindset to his brother and co-host, Jason Kelce. He stated that he plans on “just being a regular human for a couple weeks, maybe a month or so,” and then will try to figure out what he is going to do next in terms of his future in football.","Travis Kelce was nominated for the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award.

Justin Gaethje opens up on headlining UFC White House event with Ilia Topuria



Justin Gaethje talks win vs. Paddy Pimblett, wants Ilia Topuria at White House | Pat McAfee Show

Justin Gaethje has set his sights on a blockbuster title unification fight against Ilia Topuria at the highly anticipated UFC White House event on June 14. After defeating Paddy Pimblett last month to claim the interim lightweight title, Gaethje believes the next step is clear. He sees himself facing the undisputed champion on one of the most unique stages the sport has ever seen.The timing of Gaethje’s prediction has added fuel to the excitement. Topuria has recently returned to training after stepping away from the sport due to personal matters. With both fighters now active and aiming high, the possibility of a headline clash at the White House is quickly becoming one of the biggest talking points in MMA.Justin Gaethje has been open about his belief that a fight with Ilia Topuria is inevitable. Speaking on The Pat McAfee Show, he said he has imagined this moment for a long time. He described the idea of walking out near the Oval Office, entering the cage with the American flag, and competing on such a historic stage as something he has spoken into existence since his bout with Rafael Fiziev last year.He explained that his original plan was to fight Topuria earlier in the year and then defend the belt at the White House event.While plans changed due to circumstances beyond his control, Gaethje feels the outcome still favors him. Winning the interim title, in his view, makes him a champion on paper and puts him in a strong position to face Topuria in June.Topuria’s recent return to training has strengthened Gaethje’s belief. The champion posted a message declaring his comeback alongside training footage. Reports from Marca suggest that Topuria has resolved legal issues with his wife, leading to a dismissed lawsuit. He is now back at his Madrid gym and focused on fighting again.As one of the biggest MMA stars in 2026, Topuria is seen as a perfect fit to headline the special White House card. Gaethje believes their title unification fight stands above all others. He said he expects them to close the show and finds it hard to imagine a bigger option.Still, Gaethje remains flexible. He admitted that a fight with Conor McGregor would also make sense. In that scenario, he believes McGregor would headline regardless, and if Topuria did not return, the division could take a very different turn.",Justin Gaethje has set his sights on a title unification fight against Ilia Topuria at the highly anticipated UFC White House event on June 14.

After worrying about Tampa Bay Lightning forward Brayden Point's injuries, Team Canada's plans for the 2026 Winter Olympics have changed a lot. As officials worked to finalize the roster before the tournament, Carolina Hurricanes forward Seth Jarvis got the call that would put him on one of the biggest stages in international hockey.Fans and analysts had a lot to say about the decision on NHL updates. They talked about how Jarvis' selection affected them emotionally and what it meant for the team to lose a key player like Point. With the tournament coming up soon, Hockey Canada focused on adding a forward who could be fast, adaptable, and consistently good at scoring goals.Seth Jarvis apparently found out he had been picked during a pre-game routine, which made the moment even more special for the young Carolina Hurricanes forward.

He has continued to grow into a reliable player, which probably helped Team Canada make their choice.Team Canada is missing a big player in Brayden Point. The Tampa Bay Lightning center has always been a reliable player on both offense and defense, and his experience in high-pressure games would have made him a great leader. However, management had to look for other options that could keep the competitive balance because of ongoing injury updates.There was talk in NHL news circles about Connor Bedard, a forward for the Chicago Blackhawks, possibly taking over the role.From the point of view of an NHL match preview, Jarvis's addition makes both Team Canada's chances at the Olympics and the Carolina Hurricanes' upcoming NHL match today more interesting.

Patriots latest injury report

Will Robert Spillane play in the Super Bowl?

Remember the AFC Championship Game between Jarrett Stidham’s Denver Broncos and Drake Maye’s New England Patriots? The semi-finale before the Big Game! In the first quarter, 30-year-old Patriots linebacker Robert Spillane and cornerback and punt returner Marcus Jones tackled Broncos’ rookie running back RJ Harvey.The result of that tackle? Spillane stayed on the turf for several minutes, then slammed his helmet down, got up on his own, and left for the blue medical tent. Jack Gibbens took his place to play against Denver.Later, New England announced that the linebacker suffered an ankle injury and was questionable to return. The live broadcast showed in the second quarter that Spillane had returned to the bench and was limping on the sideline. He did not play for the rest of the game.Ian Steele interviewed the veteran about his ankle after the Patriots’ win over the Broncos. “Will get better and be ready for…to go,” Spillane said.Now, the moment has finally arrived. The Super Bowl is in three days. The 30-year-old star linebacker, who recorded 97 total tackles, two interceptions, one forced fumble, and one sack in the 2025 season despite missing four games, will probably play against the Seattle Seahawks in the Big Game!Linebacker Harold Landry III did not practice. Tackle Morgan Moses [not injury related / rest], tackle Thayer Munford Jr.[knee], and linebacker Robert Spillane [ankle] had limited participation at Stanford Stadium.Defensive tackle Joshua Farmer [on injured reserve with a hamstring] and quarterback Drake Maye [right shoulder] had full participation.On Wednesday’s injury report, Spillane was listed as questionable. He is still dealing with an ankle sprain he got during the championship game in Denver.“We’re excited to get out there today and run around and really test it out,” Spillane said in Thursday’s press conference. “Put it to the test. So, we’ll see.There are guys who have played a long time in this league who have waited for this opportunity, myself included. This will be my eighth year in the league, and it’s my first opportunity at a Super Bowl.It obviously doesn’t come every year. We’re just going to take advantage of it and enjoy it.” It looks like the captain may play in the Big Game!

Frank Warren REACTS to Deontay Wilder STORMING OFF SET & PROCLAIMS 'Dana White IS NO THREAT!'

Oleksandr Usyk was in New York last week for the Ring Awards and the Ring VI boxing event. The show was headlined by Teofimo Lopez against Shakur Stevenson. While the unified heavyweight champion was focused on boxing celebrations, his visit quietly fueled new talk about his next fight. It has now been six months since the Ukrainian star last stepped into the ring, and fans are eager for clarity.For months, speculation pointed toward a long-awaited clash with Deontay Wilder. Wilder remains the only major heavyweight name Usyk has not faced. However, fresh comments from promoter Frank Warren suggest the situation may be shifting. Instead of a traditional boxing rival, Usyk could be heading toward a surprise crossover fight that may delay his title defenses.Frank Warren believes Oleksandr Usyk’s next move could take him outside standard boxing territory. Speaking during fight week events in London, Warren suggested that none of Queensberry’s heavyweight fighters are currently in line to face Usyk. This includes names like Fabio Wardley, Tyson Fury, and rising talent Moses Itauma. According to Warren, this opens the door for something very different.He indicated there is a strong chance Usyk could take a bout against an MMA fighter.Such a decision would likely keep Usyk out of mandatory title defenses for the rest of the year. Warren hinted that several contenders would not be willing to wait around if that happens, especially with mandatory obligations already piling up.The rumored opponent is Rico Verhoeven. He is a former GLORY heavyweight champion and has also boxed professionally in the past. Reports suggest discussions are underway for a fight in May. MMA journalist Ruben Carter has even claimed the bout is close to being finalized for May 9.Not everyone is convinced. Eddie Hearn, who promotes Anthony Joshua, sounded unsure when asked about Verhoeven’s future. He suggested nothing has been finalized yet and left the situation open-ended.Deontay Wilder’s manager Shelly Finkel also weighed in. He believes Wilder remains the biggest name Usyk has not fought. While Wilder must first get past Derek Chisora, Finkel sees Usyk, Joshua, and Wardley as possible next targets if that happens.The buzz intensified after Turki Alalshikh shared interest on social media in seeing Verhoeven face Usyk. Still, WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman said he is unaware of any real progress.","Oleksandr Usyk was in New York last week for the Ring Awards and the Ring VI boxing event.

Iconic No. 23 returns as Anthony Davis steps into Michael Jordan’s Washington legacy



Origin of No. 23: How a simple choice became Michael Jordan’s signature?



Anthony Davis has once again found in the center of a controversy, this time following his recent move to the Washington Wizards just a year after his controversial exit from the Los Angeles Lakers to the Dallas Mavericks in early 2025, a deal that sent the Mavs star player Luka Doncic to the L.A. Lakers.Now in Washington, Davis has opted to play wearing the jersey No. 23, a number left untouched by the franchise ever since Michael Jordan's retirement in 2003. This decision has quickly sparked controversy online, with fans divided over the symbolism of reviving a number that's so closely tied to an NBA icon.Michael Jordan joined the Washington Wizards in 2001 during the third comeback of his legendary career after retiring from the Chicago Bulls. Over nearly 140 games with the Washington Wizards, where he averaged 21.2 points and 5.9 rebounds, according to ESPN.Hailing from Chicago, a 10-time NBA All-Star, Anthony Davis has long admired Michael Jordan. Davis even wore jersey number 23 during his high school playing days, before entering the league with the New Orleans Pelicans as the first overall pick in the 2012 draft. According to multiple US media reports “The Brow” as he is commonly known, has once again chosen the No.23 in Washington, a number the franchise has left unused ever since Jordan wore it during his Wizards tenure from 2001 to 2003.Michael Jordan was deeply shaped by the influence of his older brother Larry Jordan, who also played professional basketball and wore jersey No. 45. Watching his brother compete sparked Jordan's own ambition to follow his footsteps and pursue basketball, thus marking the beginning of one of the greatest careers in sports history.“My brother chose 45 and I chose 23, which was half, rounding the figure. I stuck with 23 and it stayed with me the whole time.”When it came to choosing his number, Jordan opted for No. 23 as a tribute to that bond. He truly believed that the number 23, roughly half of 45, would mean he's “half as good” as his brother, a motivation that drove him to create his legendary legacy.","Anthony Davis has chosen to wear No. 23 in Washington, a number left untouched by the franchise since Michael Jordan's retirement in 2003. The decision has sparked controversy online, with fans divided over the symbolism of reviving a number that's so closely tied to an NBA icon.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127995526,imgsize-47306,width-400,resizemode-4/anthony-davis-revives-michael-jordans-long-unused-no-23.jpg"

That's a history that has no price.""Abdul-Jabbar, who played 20 NBA seasons, chose to convert his career milestones to fund Skyhook Foundation’s flagship program, Camp Skyhook, to help bridge the educational gap and encourage fourth and fifth-graders towards a future in STEM.According to foundation data, the program has grown to serve over 70,000 students annually as of 2025.

An intense NHL game between the Boston Bruins and the Florida Panthers became one of the biggest topics in the hockey community when a questionable shot in which Charlie McAvoy of the Bruins struck a Panther player in the back resulted in an acclaimed incident in the hockey community.The aspect of physical play also does not alter the identity of the NHL, yet the occurrence of cases of possible head contact is subject to doubt. As the league has placed a stronger focus on player protection over the last few years, instances such as this tend to create a discussion on whether the fines and additional punishment actually match the danger.In the early game, Sandis Vilmanis of the Florida Panthers hit with a high shot, which seemed to hit Charlie McAvoy on the head. The Bruins defenseman was not able to leave the ice immediately after the collision, and he needed some help; this fact aroused an immediate concern among his teammates and fans. A minor punishment was imposed on Vilmanis by the officials for an illegal check to the head, but many people felt that more had to be done.The scandal was further increased as the NHL Department of Player Safety failed to provide supplemental discipline, as it was reported. Opponents say that it is common to determine a player based on whether or not he is injured as opposed to the type of hit that occurred, which casts doubt on whether there is any consistency in the outcomes of NHL matches.McAvoy is under close follow-up considering that he is a key player to the Boston Bruins line-up and that he might be given global duties.",Charlie McAvoy of the Boston Bruins was hit on the head by Sandis Vilmanis of the Florida Panthers.
