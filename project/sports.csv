'Everyone knew': Sakshi Malik opens up about sex harassment in memoir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/everyone-knew-sakshi-malik-opens-up-about-sex-harassment-in-memoir/articleshow/114383392.cms,"Trouble had a way of finding me, writes retired wrestler Sakshi Malik in her memoir , 'Witness'. It found her at age 19 when fresh from winning gold at 2012 Asian Junior Championship at Kazakhstan's Almaty, Malik faced what she describes as one of the most traumatic experiences of her life.In the autobiography, Malik, who became the first Indian women wrestler to win a bronze at Rio Olympics , writes that she was taken to wrestling federation chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh 's hotel room after her win on pretext of speaking to her parents from Singh's mobile.She alleges, ""Singh connected me to my parents. It seemed harmless. When I spoke to them telling them about my match and my medal, I remember thinking that perhaps nothing unsavoury might happen after all. But right after I ended the call, he tried to molest me while I was seated on his bed. I pushed him off and started to cry.""She alleges, ""He stepped back after that. I think he realised that I wasn't going to go along with what he wanted. He started saying that he had put his arms around me 'papa jaise' (as a father would). But I knew that was not what it was. I ran out of his room all the way back to mine, weeping.""Malik and five other women wrestlers had staged a protest at Jantar Mantar in Jan 2023 accusing Singh of multiple incidents of sexual harassment. The wrestlers filed FIRs and in May this year, a Delhi court framed charges of sexual harassment , intimidation and outraging the modesty of women against Singh who is ex-Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief and six-time Lok Sabha MP. Singh has previously denied these allegations terming them a political conspiracy against him. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges in court. Singh did not respond to multiple calls and messages asking for a response to Malik's charges.In the memoir written with Jonathan Selvaraj, Malik says Singh made repeated calls urging her to ""stay in his favour"", offering facilities like protein supplements. Malik writes that she shared information about the Almaty incident with her camp roommate Anita Sheoran and her mother. ""Although I didn't intend to spread the story, it did. Everyone knew what happened with me at Almaty. No one spoke out about it. Neither did I.""Malik says fear and anxiety affected her performance at 2012 Junior World Championships a few months later where she was a favourite after winning a bronze in the previous edition. She ended up in 17th place. This was not the only occasion when Malik had to face sexual harassment, she says. She was assaulted by a tuition teacher when she went to his home to study. ""I had been molested in my childhood too, but for a long time I could not tell my family about it as I thought it was my fault. My tuition teacher used to harass me. He would call me over to his place for classes at odd times and sometimes tried to touch me. I was scared to go for my tuition classes but I could never tell my mom. This continued for a long time and I kept quiet about it,"" she writes.Malik finally opened up to her mother who was supportive of her. ""My mother supported me not just during the incident with the tuition teacher but also when Singh started pursuing me. I tried to forget about what had happened at Almaty. That's what my parents advised me to do too. They told me to focus on my training and competition. It doesn't seem like much today, but I was grateful that I was allowed to continue to train, at least.""","Sakshi Malik is the first Indian women wrestler to win a bronze at the Rio Olympics.

Travis Kelce skips Patrick Mahomes and Taylor Swift's concert in Miami



In Kansas City , high school football games are a beloved tradition, drawing NFL stars to the sidelines for a taste of community spirit. Recently, Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany took a break from their busy schedules to enjoy a game at Blue Valley, cheering on the sons of fellow coaches. However, amidst the excitement, the notable absence of Travis Kelce turned heads and ignited speculation.What could have kept the superstar tight end from joining his best friend Mahomes on such a special night?Also Read: NFL fans are noticing strange similarity between Andy Reid and Taylor Swift’s cat for an unexpected reason It’s not every day you see NFL superstars at a high school football game, but in Kansas City, it’s a cherished tradition. Patrick Mahomes, joined by his wife Brittany, took some time to watch the sons of coaches Matt Nagy and Dave Merritt play at Blue Valley. With Chiefs players like Chris Jones and head coach Andy Reid on the sidelines, Mahomes brought his son, Bronze, to share a special family moment.While NFL Sundays and college football Saturdays captivate fans, Mahomes chose to treat his son to some high school action during their bye week before the Chiefs face off against the 49ers. Brittany even shared a charming Instagram story of the duo at the game, captioned “Friday night lights.”Patrick Mahomes recently shared his joy on Instagram about continuing a beloved Kansas City tradition: attending high school football games. Flashing back to 2022, when he had just one Super Bowl title, Mahomes was spotted at Blue Valley with his wife, Brittany. When asked about his passion for these games, the Chiefs QB remarked,“I got to go to Ted’s son’s high school football game a couple of weeks back. I know you know Ted, he is our PR guy. His son, I’ve been here for six years now so I’ve seen him grow up and he’s starting in varsity so I went and watched him play.”In 2022, Mahomes attended games featuring QB coach Matt Nagy’s sons, one of whom played as starting QB while the other lined up at cornerback. “I went and watched Nagy’s sons. Luckily enough for me. Brittany loves sports as much as I do. So a couple of guys, we went out there and got to watch some high school football.” he added. (via: EssentiallySports)This week, Mahomes kept the tradition alive, but one notable absence turned heads: Travis Kelce, who skipped the game to join his best friend Mahomes and also missed his girlfriend's Eras Tour concert in Miami.Travis Kelce’s absence from Taylor Swift 's concert at the Blue Valley high school game surprised fans, especially after he had traveled the world to catch her on the Eras Tour. His no-show in Miami raised eyebrows about their relationship, despite recent sightings of the couple enjoying a lavish NYC dinner with Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively and sharing affectionate moments at a Yankees game.Adding to the intrigue, the entire Kelce family, including his mother Donna and brother Jason, were present at Hard Rock Stadium while Travis was missing. This was particularly significant as it marked Donna’s first live experience of Swift’s performance, even though Jason and his wife Kylie had previously attended her concerts.This rises the question: Is there more to the story behind Travis's absence, or is it just the latest gossip? As the couple continues to make headlines since their summer romance began in 2023, fans are eager for answers.Also Read: Is Hailee Steinfeld attending Bills’ Week 7 matchup against Titans to avoid a ‘Bad Omen’ with Josh Allen?","Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany attended a high school football game in Kansas City.

Others placed it in historical context for example, as a victory lap, as such state as was from one fan: ""Singing the national anthem in London because we won the war."".Some people say that the British fans should have responded because it was not right to ignore the provocation.

Kansas City Chiefs secure dominant win over 49ers in Super Bowl rematch



The Kansas City Chiefs took their unbeaten record to California in Week 7, facing off against the San Francisco 49ers in a highly anticipated Super Bowl rematch . The game did not disappoint, as the Chiefs continued their dominance over the 49ers, securing a 28-18 victory and marking their fifth straight win over San Francisco, including postseason encounters.Also Read: NFL's Choice to Play US National Anthem in London Sparks Outrage Over Historical Hypocrisy and American Arrogance Patrick Mahomes , despite throwing two interceptions, played a crucial role in leading his team to victory.Known for his passing prowess, Mahomes showcased his versatility by using his feet to make significant plays, including the longest run of his career. His ability to overcome adversity in the game was essential in keeping the Chiefs undefeated. Reflecting on the recent lack of passing touchdowns, Mahomes admitted, ""I just don’t think it’s normal for what you’ve seen from us because there’s not a lot of passing touchdowns."" This game marked only the second time in his career that he went back-to-back games without a touchdown pass.While Mahomes acknowledged his turnovers, he emphasized the broader strength of the team. He stated that their success is not solely dependent on him or the passing game, but rather on their collective effort. ""It’s not just about me, it’s not just about the stats and the light show,"" Mahomes explained, highlighting how their running game and defense stepped up when needed. With 184 rushing yards, the Chiefs recorded their best ground performance of the season, finding the end zone four times—something they hadn’t accomplished since the 2018 playoffs.On the defensive side, Kansas City excelled, forcing three interceptions from 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy, which crippled San Francisco’s chances of staying in the game. This, paired with Mahomes’ uncharacteristically low passing yardage—his second-lowest ever in a non-injury game—further emphasized the Chiefs’ versatility in winning games through a complete team effort.Though this victory didn’t carry the same weight as their Super Bowl showdown eight months prior, the Chiefs once again emerged victorious, continuing their streak over the 49ers. With their 6-0 record intact, Kansas City remains a force to be reckoned with, proving they are much more than a one-dimensional team, ready to challenge any opponent.Also Read: Taylor Swift Concert Turns Chaotic as Kyle Long Explodes Over Seating Disaster","Kansas City Chiefs secure dominant win over 49ers in Super Bowl rematch.

Naseem Shah, on the other hand, has showcased his raw pace and swing, becoming a key figure for Pakistan at a very young age.Interestingly, this isn’t the first time Pakistani players have preferred Naseem Shah over Bumrah.In an earlier podcast appearance, former Pakistan captain Babar Azam was asked whom he would trust for the final over in a high-pressure T20 match with 10 runs to defend.Without hesitation, Babar replied, “Naseem Shah.”Bumrah’s track record, however, speaks for itself.

BENGALURU: A near fatal car accident in Dec 2022 and resultant injuries and rehab may have kept Rishabh Pant out of the game for over a year-and-a-half, but his gritty comeback has the support of the team management, which is 'extra careful' while handling the wicketkeeper batter's workload. Rohit Sharma revealed that as a precautionary measure, Pant was not behind the stumps on the final day despite batting in India's second innings during his dazzling knock of 99.""He has had a massive operation. We must be a little careful about where he is at and what he is to us. Even when he was batting, he was not comfortably running and was trying to only put the ball in the stands. When you are keeping, you need to bend every ball with your knee going down. And the wicket being what it was, we thought it was the right thing to do for him to stay inside and get 100% ready for the next one.""On handling Pant with care, the skipper stated, ""With someone like him, we just need to be extra careful. Because he has had a lot of minor surgeries, one big surgery on his knee. He has also gone through a lot of trauma.""Rohit also stressed on the team management's acceptance of Pant's unconventional approach towards his game. ""To be honest, no one knows what goes on in his mind,"" Rohit admitted.""He decides what he wants to do. And that is the kind of freedom we want to give to him because he has produced performances with that mindset. I don't think there is anything that you need to speak to him about.

IPL 11 Bulldoze PSL 11 | Basit Ali

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has voiced his disappointment over a heated on-field incident between Pakistan A ’s Sufiyan Muqeem and India A ’s opener Abhishek Sharma during the ACC Men's T20 Emerging Teams Asia Cup 2024.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Basit criticized Muqeem’s behaviour, emphasizing that young cricketers need to learn sportsmanship and respect for opponents.“The cricket was top-class, but one thing that really upset me was the incident involving Sufiyan Muqeem and Abhishek Sharma. If I were sitting in the dugout or the team manager, I would have told Sufiyan, ‘Son, pick up your things and go back.’ You haven’t even played proper cricket for Pakistan yet, and you’re already using abusive language—what kind of behaviour is this?” Basit said.Referring to Muqeem’s send-off gesture after dismissing Abhishek Sharma, Basit added, “You’re hurling abuses—did you take a hat-trick or something? (Aap gaaliyan de rahe hai, kya aapne hat-trick leliya?) You’re not at that level yet. The management needs to teach young players how to respect the opposition.”The controversial moment occurred during a tense clash between India A and Pakistan A at Al Amerat.Abhishek Sharma had gotten off to a flying start, scoring 35 off 22 balls, with five boundaries and two sixes. However, his innings came to an end in the sixth over when he mistimed a shot off Muqeem’s bowling, leading to a sharp catch by Qasim Akram.After the dismissal, Muqeem made a “silence gesture” toward Abhishek, which infuriated the Indian opener, leading to a heated exchange. Umpires Chamara de Zoysa and Rahul Asher had to step in to restore order.Despite the tension, India A held their nerve to secure a narrow 7-run win, posting 183/8 and restricting Pakistan A to 176/7.",Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has voiced his disappointment over a heated on-field incident.

NEW DELHI: After India's first Test loss to New Zealand in Bengaluru, former Indian cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar questioned captain Rohit Sharma 's tactical choices.After New Zealand added 137 vital runs for the eighth wicket in their first innings, Rohit came under heavy fire for his captaincy. On the fifth day of the contest, the criticism persisted.Only after 10 runs had been scored did Rohit decide to bring on Ravichandran Ashwin , India's most effective bowler at home, with New Zealand requiring 107 runs to win.Rather, he used Mohammed Siraj , who failed to produce any returns in two spells of seven overs and was wicketless.""The thing with pacers, you might get wickets, but there are always runs coming through edges. I was a bit surprised, I think tactically for Rohit Sharma, this Test match wasn't his greatest. I can understand Siraj getting one or two overs and Bumrah getting a long spell. But Siraj getting 6 overs in that spell, I think that is far too many and already a lot of runs on the board, and you had that little margin to chase,"" Manjrekar said, as quoted by ESPNcricinfo.""And another part is Aswhin. When there is no lavish turn on the pitch, the captain tends to use him with a new ball. He would have been tough for the Kiwi batters had he started off with Bumrah, and even if he had come in the fourth over of the inning,"" he added.He drew attention to India's crucial tactical mistakes on the last day. It was only New Zealand's third Test victory overall and their first in India since 1988.Rohit Sharma commended his team's tenacity, especially their comeback in the second innings, despite the shocking eight-wicket defeat. India demonstrated incredible tenacity by scoring 462 to set a target of 107 for New Zealand despite trailing by a significant 356 runs at the end of the first innings.""It was a good effort with the bat in the second innings. We didn't bat well in the first innings. So knew what was ahead and couple of guys stood out. When you are 350 behind you can't think too much about it. just got to see the ball and bat. Couple of partnerships were really exciting to watch and got us back in the game. We could have easily been bowled out cheaply but proud of the effort,"" Rohit said at the post-match presentation.India needs to win the next two Test matches to keep up their remarkable 18-match winning streak in home Test series .

Amelia Kerr contributed a vital 43 off 38 balls, while Brooke Halliday's impactful 38 off 28 balls propelled New Zealand past the 150-run mark.In response, South Africa's opening pair, led by skipper Laura Wolvaardt (33 off 27), took their team to 47 for no loss in the powerplay.However, the New Zealand bowlers managed to restrict the opposition's scoring rate, and South Africa ultimately finished with 126 for nine in their allotted 20 overs.Kerr shone with her leg-spin, claiming three wickets for 24 runs in her four-over spell.New Zealand's success in the tournament was a remarkable turnaround, considering they had entered the competition on the back of 10 consecutive losses.Throughout the tournament, they consistently demonstrated the best bowling unit by a considerable margin, and in the final, they elevated their batting performance to secure the championship.South Africa's chances of victory diminished significantly after the loss of their determined captain Wolvaardt in the 10th over.Kerr claimed the crucial wicket as Wolvaardt, attempting to increase the scoring rate, found Suzie Bates at cover.The dismissal of Anneke Bosch, the semifinal hero, just five balls later, further solidified New Zealand's advantage.

GILL AND SHAMI HIT THE NETS

WASHINGTON ADDED TO INDIA SQUAD

SQUAD:

BENGALURU: A thick cloud cover and the omnipresent threat of rain on Sunday suggested conditions were ripe for India's quicks to pick off New Zealand on the final day of an engrossing first Test.It was not lost on Rohit Sharma and his men. The way the skipper had protested the umpires decision of offering the light to New Zealand's openers just before rain came down in buckets at the fag end on the penultimate day suggested as much.But while Jasprit Bumrah , especially, swung the ball prodigiously and asked the hard questions, the first innings failure with the bat came back to haunt the Indian team.The Black Caps withstood that assault, eventually easing to an eight-wicket win with two sessions to spare.Latham and his men ended a 36-year-old wait for a win on Indian soil. Their last Test victory was in 1988 when a John Wright-led side registered a 136-run win over Dilip Vengsarkar's team at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.New Zealand also became the third team in Test cricket after Australia and England to thump India at home in over a decade. It was also their first Test win in four attempts at the venue.The target of 107 was too modest although morning rain left New Zealand nervous as the start of play was delayed by an hour.When play did begin, the visitors lost Latham when a length delivery from Bumrah nipped back, and the skipper was caught in front. India's hopes soared with that early wicket. Bumrah struck again, removing a battling Devon Conway (17) by trapping him leg before. New Zealand were still 72 runs behind at that point.But while Bumrah was dangerous, Siraj at the other end struggled a bit as did the spinners when the quicks ended their opening spells.Man of the match and first innings centurion Rachin Ravindra (39 n.o) settled the nerves alongside Will Young (48 n.o) and eased the strain in the New Zealand dressing room by sneaking a boundary off Bumrah through gully and backing it up with another flick through midwicket. That was when India's hopes began to evaporate.The spinners, Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav only hastened the visitor's victory march. With menacing clouds hovering around, the Kiwis wanted to leave nothing to chance. Young and Ravindra attacked the slow bowlers, with the former highlighting the duo's dominance by clobbering Kuldeep for a six over mid-wicket.Strangely, go-to spinner R Ashwin was brought on when New Zealand needed 10 runs to win. Ashwin could only delay the inevitable.While the loss is bound to hurt, Rohit later admitted that there were plenty of gains. Coming back from being bowled out for 46 to scoring 462 with two tenacious talents - Sarfaraz Khan and Rishabh Pant-leading the charge, augurs well for India. It helped the hosts to push the rain-affected match to the fifth day.In retrospect, India will analyse the twin collapses - the mayhem in the first innings and the loss of seven wickets for 54 runs in their second essay.The loss did not alter India's position on top of the World Test Championship table (98 points; 68.06 PCT). It propelled New Zealand to the fourth position (48 pts; 44.44). With five Tests in hand in the current cycle, the Kiwis have some catching up to do.Less than an hour after the match, it was clear India wanted to put the loss behind as Shubham Gill, who missed the Test due to a stiff neck, started practising on the centre pitch. Also making an appearance at the nets was a heavily strapped Mohammed Shami , who has been sidelined due to a knee injury.TNNTamil Nadu allrounder Washington Sundar was on Sunday added to the India squad for the remaining two Tests against New Zealand.The 25-year-old's inclusion comes after his 152 for Tamil Nadu in the ongoing Ranji Trophy match against Delhi. Washington had played a crucial role in India's historic win against Australia at the Gabba.Rohit Sharma (C), Jasprit Bumrah (VC), Yashasvi Jaiswal , Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Sarfaraz Khan, Rishabh Pant (WK), Dhruv Jurel (WK), R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohd.

When the guys are showing that kind of attitude on the field with the bat, it shows that the mindset is clear and they want to go out there and play with freedom,"" said Rohit on Sunday.Highlighting his men's positive mindset, the opener said, ""Whatever the situation is, unless you have belief, you are not going to achieve it. That is the mindset, talk and approach of this team. This team is not going to give it up so easily. We are going to keep fighting till it is over.""Defending a paltry lead of 106 runs was always daunting, but India, given their bowling attack, did fancy their chances. ""To get them to chase that 100-odd runs also was a great effort, after being 350 behind. When you are chasing a small total like that, you know on a pitch where so much cricket has been played, there is a lot of wear and tear in the pitch, anything is possible. And we have quality in our bowling line-up.We came with the belief of trying to pull the results towards us. But it didn't happen,"" Rohit stated.While India, with a batting wealth to choose from, Rohit said, the message to the players is clear-seize the opportunity and make the most of it.

Already conceding the first innings lead to Chandigarh on Day 2, hosts Assam now find themselves in a position from where they would need a miracle to save their Ranji Trophy Group D match on the final day.Coming to bat in their second essay after finishing the visitors’ first innings on 374 at Barsapara Cricket Stadium , the home team was down to 144 for seven wickets in 55 overs at stumps on Day 3.The Denish Das-led northeast side has only 36-run lead with just three wickets in hand.Barring any intervention by the weather God on the fourth and last day, it seems unlikely that Assam would be able to avoid the outright loss in the second-round game.Meanwhile, Raj Bawa continued to underline his potential as a pace-bowling all-rounder for Chandigarh as he missed his maiden 150-run mark by just four runs after resuming the day on 122. He then turned up with the ball to bowl an impressive 5-2-9-1 spell, giving the visitors their first breakthrough, castling Assam opener Rahul Hazarika on 22.Assam batters again paid the price of not converting their starts as wickets tumbled at regular intervals with all the top-4 batters returning to pavilion in their 20s. Opener Parvej Musaraf was the top scorer for Assam with 27 runs off 87 balls and it underscored the plight of the home team.Medium pacer Jagjit Singh was the wrecker-in-chief for Chandigarh who scalped four wickets while left-arm spinner Nishunk Birla accounted for two as Assam lost their last four wickets of the day for just 20 runs.Already huffing and puffing to surpass Chandigarh’s 108-run first innings lead, Assam went down from 117/3 to 137/7 in about six overs before Sumit Ghadigaonkar (7 batting) and Mukhtar Hussain (5 batting) saw off the last 16 balls without further damage.Earlier, Rahul Singh was the pick of the Assam bowlers with four wickets, though he gave away 128 runs from his 35 overs.

New Zealand 's Amelia Kerr , whose match-winning performance guided the White Ferns to their first T20 Women's World Cup on Sunday, said teammates Sophie Devine and Suzie Bates had so inspired her when she was at school that she wrote stories about winning the trophy with them.The 24-year-old leg-spinner top-scored with 43 in the New Zealand total of 158-5 and then took 3-24 as South Africa fell short by 32 runs.Kerr finished the tournament as the leading wicket-taker with 15 and collected both the Player of the Match and Player of the Tournament Awards.But 14 years ago, Kerr watched forlornly on television as New Zealand, with current skipper Devine and opening bat Bates in the side, lost the 2010 final to Australia by just three runs.It was a moment that triggered a love for the game and a desire to put the record right.""I was inspired to be a White Fern watching that 2010 World Cup which Sophie was at,"" said Kerr who made her international debut when she was just 16.""From that moment I was at the nets with my dad pretending I was batting with Sophie and Suzie.""And I was in the team so young and playing with my role models who have been so good to me, two of New Zealand's greatest ever cricketers.""I just think back to myself as a kid. When I was at primary school in creative writing, I wrote about winning a World Cup with Sophie and Suzie.""I don't necessarily believe you deserve things in sport, but if any two people do, it's Sophie and Suzie.""Devine, 35, and Bates, 37, are two of the elder stateswomen in the side along with 34-year-old Lea Tahuhu Each of them made their mark on the final. Bates made 32 and took three catches while fast bowler Tahuhu squeezed the South African middle order.Devine only made six but her leadership was outstanding, bringing out the best in the younger players in the team, like Kerr.- 'Heartbreak and happiness' -""We joke about being grandmas and mums and whatnot but you feel a real sense of pride at seeing them stand up and take opportunities. Melie (Kerr) today was unbelievable,"" said the skipper.""For us to be able to win it, it's just nice to have that. It's always something that you want to have when you finish your career.""Devine's first action after winning was to embrace her fellow 'grandma' Bates who has now played 334 white ball internationals since making her debut back in 2006.""Me and Suze have been through a lot together,"" she said.""We've been through a lot of hairstyles together, hers a lot worse than mine.""""But to be able to share it, to be fielding close together as well and to share that moment, that embrace, that's 17, 18 years of joy and heartbreak and happiness shared in that moment. It's just been awesome to share that with her.""With the men's cricket team also completing a spectacular win in Bengaluru earlier in the day, their first Test win in India since 1988, Sunday was arguably New Zealand's finest ever day on the cricket field, although Devine hopes there is more to come.""I'm really hopeful that tonight's victory can inspire that next generation of not just young girls but young boys as well to pick up a cricket bat, a cricket ball,"" she said.""It still feels pretty surreal at the moment and hopefully the impact of what we've been able to achieve is going to be long-standing and long-reaching.

Despite the clear weather in Ahmedabad on Sunday, a cloud of uncertainty hovers over the fortunes of Jharkhand on whether they will be able to secure the first innings lead for three points in their second-round match of Ranji Trophy Elite Group D against Railways .As things stand at stumps on Day 3 at ADSA Railways Cricket Ground, Railways' solid reply to Jharkhand's first innings total of 417 sees them on 320 for four wickets from 101 overs.So, the home side is very much in the hunt for a first innings lead as they trail Jharkhand by only 97 runs with six wickets in hand and the entire final day remaining.Mohammad Saif (113 runs off 208 balls, 12x4, 2x6) led Railways' charge with his seventh first-class century while overnight batter Vivek Singh (75 off 160) and Upendra Yadav scored half-centuries to put on a steady show as Jharkhand bowlers were made to toil hard throughout the day.Resuming the day on 19/1, Railways overnight batters Vivek Singh and captain Pratham Singh (24 runs off 47 balls) batted with caution and took the scoreboard to 61 before the skipper departed in the 11th over of the day, returning a catch to Virat Singh off right-arm pacer Supriyo Chakraborty's bowling. Pratham's was the only wicket to fall in the first session as Vivek was then joined by only century-maker of the day Saif.The duo put on 120 runs for the third wicket at a brisk pace in less than 30 overs to take the score to 181 when Vivek was caught leg-before-wicket by off-spinner Utkarsh Singh. Vivek's return to pavilion put a brake on Railways scoring pace but there was no stopping them as Saif and Upendra then stitched together a steady partnership of 88 runs for the fourth wicket in about 32 overs. Saif was caught and bowled by Utkarsh, who returned 2-55.Jharkhand's case was further damaged in the last session by a rampaging Ashutosh Sharma of Indian Premier League (IPL) fame. The Punjab Kings batter raced to an unbeaten 45 off 40 balls with four boundaries and three hits clearing the rope at a strike rate of 112.5. Sharma's blitzkrieg with the bat reduced his partner Upendra to a mere onlooker at the other end as they shared a 51-run stand for the unbroken fifth wicket where the former's share was 45.Sharma remaining at the crease along with Upendra will keep the Jharkhand camp worried. To stop Railways from surpassing their score on the final day, Jharkhand bowlers need to pull up their socks and strike some early blows for sure.Jharkhand 417. Railways (o/n 19/1) 320/4 in 101 overs (Vivek Singh 75, Mohd Saif 113, Upendra Yadav 53 batting, Ashutosh Sharma 45 batting; Utkarsh Singh 2-55, Supriyo Chakraborty 1-12).

It ended a magnificent 222-run second wicket stand that spanned 342 balls, between Gaikwad and Dhas, playing just his third first-class match after impressing with a match-winning 96 for the India Under-19 team against South Africa in the U-19 World Cup semifinal in Benoni in February this year.However, it was Gaikwad's wicket that allowed Mumbai a foot in the door they desperately needed.Introduced into the attack as later as the 57th over, off-spinning allrounder Tanush Kotian, who too is set to depart with the India A team to Australia, then struck thrice in succession, prising out Azim Kazi (7), 'keeper-bat Nikhil Naik (5) and Arshin Kulkarni (0, caught brilliantly by a leaping SKY at short mid-wicket).However, for a team which was shot out for just 126 at lunch on Day One in their Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match here at the Sharad Pawar Cricket Academy in BKC, Maharashtra, unwilling to go down without a fight in this prestigious ‘Maharashtra Derby,' showed their mettle in their second innings all through, albeit with the wicket having eased out considerably.Refusing to thrown in the towel, the seasoned Ankit Bawne , who crossed 8,000 first-class runs during his fine knock, stroked his 24th first-class century (101, 152b, 10x4), adding 88 in 148 balls for the seventh wicket with Satyajeet Bachhav (20), before Mumbai roared back, wrapping up Maharashtra's innings at 388 by taking the last four wickets for just five runs. Sweating it out for a day and a session, Mulani (3-150 in 36 overs), Tanush Kotian (3-74 in 25 overs) and Mohit Avasthi (3-65 in 19.3 overs) were rewarded for their efforts, as Mumbai, chasing 74 and a bonus point win on Monday which will help them bounce back after the drubbing at the hands of Baroda in the first match, finished at 13 for no loss. For the record, it will be Mumbai's 17 outright win over Maharashtra.Gaikwad's 87-ball century here, which ended a drought of 13 first-class innings and 21 months for him-will be remembered for a long time. The 27-year-old began Sunday's proceedings with a bang, hooking Shardul Thakur for a six off the very first ball after play began at 10am due to overnight rain.Shrugging off a relatively lean run-he logged two fifties in six innings in the Duleep Trophy, followed by scores of in the Irani Cup versus Mumbai and 86 against Jammu & Kashmir, Gaikwad led Maharashtra's stiff resistance in the second innings, which has taken the match into Day Four and restored the visitors' pride.Gushing about Gaikwad's sublime batting style, Maharashtra coach Sulakshan Kulkarni said, ""It was a quality hundred against a good side. In terms of pure statistics, a lot of players get hundreds, but there are some batsmen who are a treat to watch, and Ruturaj is one of them. His 145 was pleasing to watch. He's an amazing talent, and he has added hard work to his talent and multiplied it. He's a 'touch player.' A quality that very good batsmen possess is that they convert the good balls into runs/boundaries. That's why he has that special class.""Pointing out how Gaikwad was also a quick runner between the wickets, Kulkarni said, ""He is among the finest runners between the wickets, which helps him get his runs, his partner's runs and the team's runs. That will be an advantage for the Indian team in the future when Virat Kohli calls it day. His running between the wickets is also a treat to watch.""",Ruturaj Gaikwad scores his seventh first-class hundred for Maharashtra. Mumbai bowler Shams Mulani takes three wickets for just five runs.

Kolkata: Mohammedan Sporting faced some home truth again as Kerala Blasters rode a second-half fightback to beat the Indian Super League debutants 2-1 at the Kishore Bharati Stadium on Sunday.The hosts went ahead in the 28th minute when Brazilian Carlos Franca earned a penalty and his Uzbekistani teammate Mirjalol Kasimov converted it much to the joy of the partisan crowd.But Kerala Blasters stormed back into the contest through goals from Kwame Peprah (67) and Jesus Jimenez (75).This was the first victory in three consecutive matches on the road for Mikael Stahre ’s Blasters, who had earlier drawn their clashes with NorthEast United FC and Odisha FC.Mohammedan SC , on the other hand, remain winless at home, their latest setback coming after a 0-3 mauling at the hands of Mohun Bagan SG two weeks ago. Their defensive frailties came to the fore again as they lost another plot after taking the lead. Andrey Chernyshov ’s side suffered an early jolt when Ghanaian defender Joseph Adjei had to leave the ground with a serious leg injury, thus paving the way for new recruit Frenchman Florent Ogier to make his debut in the black-and-white colours.The hosts, however, took the lead deservedly when Franca latched on to a brilliant ball from his half and fell under the challenge of Blasters custodian Som Kumar, leading to the penalty. Kasimov sent the goalkeeper the wrong way from the spot.Blasters announced their intention of a comeback when they finished the first half with Jimenez hitting the crosspiece.Franca missed a golden chance to extend the lead on the hour mark when he went for glory himself instead of sending the ball to an unmarked Fanai at the other end. Thus reprieved, Blasters came calling, Adrian Luna whipping in a long cross and Noah Sadaoui — who was a constant threat to the hosts’ box from the left — sent it back across the six-yard box for Peprah to make it 1-1, two minutes after replacing fellow defender Alexandre Coeff.Sadaoui then missed a sitter, failing to beat Mohammedan SC goalkeeper Padam Chhetri from a one-on-one situation. But it didn’t prove costly as Jimenez rose to the occasion, meeting Huidrom Naocha’s cross with a perfect header, taking Ogier’s challenge in his stride.Fanai could have salvaged a draw deep in stoppage-time but Blasters goalkeeper Som produced a brilliant save to ensure that his team returned home with a win.",Kerala Blasters beat Indian Super League debutants Mohammedan Sporting 2-1 at the Kishore Bharati Stadium.

They could make the most of the break time on offer, and on Monday, Jamshedpur FC and Hyderabad FC will retake the field in the last fixture of the fifth round of Indian Super League with a sense of optimism reigning at both ends.It will be another opportunity for Jamshedpur to continue their best ISL start in front of the home crowd at JRD Tata Sports Complex . With nine points from four matches, the Khalid Jamil-led side has surpassed their preceding league campaign so far and the Indian head coach backed his team to maximise the familiar conditions at home.“It is a very important game for us.We are playing in front of our home crowd. They’re a good team. They’re stronger than before. We must prepare well and take a positive result from this match,” Jamil said in the pre-match press conference on Sunday.Jamil’s stress on “a positive result” is guided by the fact that — currently lying in third spot — a win against Hyderabad on Monday would take the Men of Steel above Mohun Bagan Super Giant and a point behind leaders Bengaluru FC on the second position.With Jamshedpur’s creator-in-chief Imran Khan leading the charts among Indian players producing most goal-scoring chances, the likes of Jordan Murray and Javier Siverio are expected to be provided with ample scope to convert upfront. Jamil will also have the dependable Stephen Eze in backline to lead their defence.However, the hosts will take on a Hyderabad side — led by the only other Indian coach in the league Thangboi Singto — that secured a clean sheet in their last match against Chennaiyin FC , breaking a run of five games where they conceded at least two goals. They will be eager to build on it and achieve back-to-back clean sheets for the first time since March 2023.However, their attack — with the likes of youngster Devendra Murgaonkar — will need to step up as they remain winless this season.“The players have become stronger as a group, in terms of respect and camaraderie. Football is a team sport. If they can relate that respect on the pitch, then the results will speak for themselves,” head coach Singto said on Sunday.But an in-form Jamshedpur will be in their way with the aim of continuing their run this season, rejuvenated by a much-needed break. “It is good for everybody. They recovered. Everyone went for a break for a few days and then came back. The players who were not fit are fit now. So we are ready,” added Jamil ahead of their return to action at the Furnace.","Jamshedpur FC and Hyderabad FC will meet in the fifth round of the Indian Super League on Monday.

Robert Lewandowski scored two more goals to extend his league-leading tally to 12 and Barcelona routed Sevilla 5-1 to open a three-point gap on Real Madrid ahead of next weekend's ""clasico.""Pedri and Pablo Torre also scored Sunday for the Catalan club, which restored its lead of La Liga a day after second-place Madrid won 2-1 at Celta Vigo.Barcelona midfielder Gavi came off the bench to replace Pedri in the 83rd minute, making his return to action nearly a year after a serious knee injury.""I had been dreaming about this moment for several months,"" Gavi said. ""It's tough to watch from the outside. I have to enjoy every moment. I feel very lucky to be here today.""Barcelona will play Madrid on Saturday at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium. Both teams have Champions League matches midweek - Madrid hosts Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday and Barcelona hosts Bayern Munich on Wednesday.""This was an important win considering the matches that we have ahead,"" Pedri said. ""We had to leave with a good feeling and the three points.""Lewandowski scored twice in the first half against the visitors, first by converting a 24th-minute penalty kick and then by finding the net from close range in the 39th.The Poland striker was coming off a hat trick at Alaves in the previous league round, and had scored twice in the team's win over Young Boys in the Champions League. He has 14 goals in 11 matches in all competitions this season.Lewandowski, who received a standing ovation when he was substituted in the 65th, nearly got his hat track against Sevilla in a one-on-one situation in the first half.Pedri scored with a curling shot from outside the area in the 28th and Torre added to the lead from inside the area in the 82nd and with a free kick in the 88th. Raphinha had a 49th-minute goal disallowed for offside.Barcelona has outscored its league opponents 33-10 this season.Sevilla, which had no attempts on target in the first half, scored its lone goal in the 87th with 19-year-old substitute Stanis Idumbo.Barcelona also saw Lamine Yamal return from a muscle strain that saw him leave Spain's squad during the international break.Barcelona defender Eric Garcia hurt a muscle in the team's warmup and did not play.Atletico's stadium partially closed Fewer fans than normal watched Atletico Madrid beat Leganes 3-1 in a match played in a partially closed stadium because of recent fan trouble.Alexander Sorloth scored twice and Antoine Griezmann once after the visitors took the lead in the first half at the Metropolitano stadium, which had an empty fan section behind one of the goals as punishment after Atletico fans threw objects on the field during a city derby against Real Madrid last month.The section is where the club's more radical supporters usually gather.Atletico had been originally ordered to close the section for three matches but appealed the decision and the punishment was reduced to a single match. The derby was interrupted for more than 15 minutes after fans threw the objects near Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois in a game that ended 1-1.Sunday's victory, which ended Atletico's three match winless streak in all competitions, moved Diego Simeone's team to third place in the league. It trails Barcelona by seven points.Atletico midfielder Pablo Barrios and defender Clement Lenglet both got injured.Griezmann was sent off late in the game after he slid into an opponent, but the red card was changed to a yellow after video review.Other results Villarreal is in fourth place after conceding an 87th-minute equalizer in a 1-1 draw against Getafe. Santiago Comesana had put the hosts ahead in the 44th.Mallorca defeated visiting Rayo Vallecano 1-0 with a goal by Vedat Muriqi in the 75th. It was the fourth win in five matches for Mallorca, which moved to sixth place in the standings. Rayo stayed ninth.Lautaro Martinez made sure that Inter Milan kept pace with Serie A leaders Napoli by netting the Italian champions' only goal in Sunday's 1-0 win at Roma.Argentina striker Martinez lashed home his fourth goal of the season in all competitions on the hour mark after a poor clearance from Zeki Celik to give Inter a hard-fought win at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.Inter remain two points behind Napoli, 1-0 winners at Empoli, as Italy's top four all won this weekend, with a huge match against Juventus at the San Siro coming up in a week's time.Before that Inter will try to continue their positive start to their Champions League campaign in Bern, where Simone Inzaghi's side will take on Young Boys potentially without Hakan Calhanoglu and Francesco Acerbi who both forced off with injuries in the first half.Inter will however be buoyed by a solid performance in the Italian capital which could have easily ended with a bigger win as Roma goalkeeper Mile Svilar did well to charge off his line and keep out Marcus Thuram and Denzel Dumfries.""The boys played well... once we broke the deadlock we had chances to score again and should have,"" said Inzaghi to DAZN.""I'm very happy with what the boys showed me today.""Roma meanwhile are lagging behind in 10th following a second league defeat of a what is already a troubled season for the capital club.The match began in a strange atmosphere as Roma's hardcore fans stayed outside the ground for the first 15 minutes in protest at the direction of the club under billionaire American owner Dan Friedkin.Fans are still unhappy about idol Daniele De Rossi being sacked last month and frustrated by the management of Roma, who last qualified for the Champions League in 2018.""We created chances but didn't take advantage of them... to give away a goal the way we did in a match like this is a real shame because the team played well,"" said Roma coach Ivan Juric.Khvicha Kvaratskhelia struck the only goal, and his fourth of the season, from the penalty spot in the 63rd minute to give Napoli their fourth straight win in all competitions.Empoli beat Napoli home and away last season and their victory in Naples last November cost Rudi Garcia his job as coach, as a disastrous league title defence ended with southern Italy's biggest club in 10th.And the hosts were the better team for large portions of the match, with Kvaratskhelia's winning spot-kick Napoli's only shot on target in front of thousands of enthusiastic travelling supporters.Napoli don't have European football as a result of their collapse following a first Scudetto since 1990 and the days of Diego Maradona.And under Antonio Conte Napoli have quickly re-established themselves as title challengers, with the advantage of not having the expanded Champions League jamming up their schedule.""We're trying to build something here, something that isn't just a flash in the pan but lasts long-term,"" said Conte to DAZN.Fiorentina hammered 10-man Lecce 6-0 to move up to fifth and six points behind Napoli with their best performance since Raffaele Palladino took over in the summer.Braces from both Danilo Cataldi and Andrea Colpani, the latter's first goals since following Palladino from Monza, drove Fiorentina to a thumping away win which also featured strikes from Lucas Beltran and Fabiano Parisi.Fiorentina were helped by Antonino Gallo being harshly sent off for fouling Dodo with the score 2-0, the offence considered the denial of a clear goalscoring opportunity despite the presence of other defenders.Level on points with Fiorentina in sixth place are Atalanta who eased to a 2-0 win at bottom side Venezia thanks in large part to in-form striker Mateo Retegui.Italy attacker Retegui helped Mario Pasalic open the scoring early on and then sealed the points two minutes after the break with a delightful chipped finish.Retegui, who only signed for Atalanta after Gianluca Scamacca suffered a serious knee injury before the start of the season, leads the Serie A scoring charts with eight goals.Young players made their mark as Union Berlin's resurgence in the Bundesliga continued with a 2-0 win over struggling Holstein Kiel on Sunday.Nineteen-year-old wing back Tom Rothe crossed for 20-year-old midfielder Aljoscha Kemlein to score his first senior goal with a header in the 18th minute. Rothe — who played a key role in Kiel earning promotion last season — made sure of the win when he headed in Union's second goal at a corner in the 85th.The win lifts Union to fifth in the Bundesliga, three points off leader Bayern Munich. Union recorded back-to-back wins in the league for the first time since February.Union stunned German soccer by finishing fourth in the Bundesliga to qualify for the Champions League in 2023 but last season was a failure. Union was winless on its Champions League debut and finished 15th in the Bundesliga.Promoted Kiel is in the relegation zone and is the only team yet to earn a point at home this season in the Bundesliga after losing its fourth home game in a row.Also Sunday, Werder Bremen recovered from 1-0 down to beat Wolfsburg 4-2 and rise to eighth.Tiago Tomas gave Wolfsburg the lead with his heel as the ball ricocheted around a packed penalty area, but Mitchell Weiser's volley deep into first-half added time got Bremen back into the game. Second-half goals from Bremen's Felix Agu, Marvin Ducksch and Marco Grüll secured the win.Wolfsburg coach Ralph Hasenhüttl will also have to do without attacking midfielder Patrick Wimmer, who faces a suspension after being sent off for a desperate lunging tackle on Grüll.Wolfsburg is 13th and has scored the opening goal in each of its last four Bundesliga games but won only one of them. It also has only one point in its four home games.Marseille got back to winning ways in style with a 5-0 thumping of Montpellier on Sunday to move within three points of Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain.A fast start to the season had raised hopes of Marseille challenging for a first title since 2010 under Roberto De Zerbi before they dropped off with a defeat by Strasbourg and draw with Angers.But OM were at their best at bottom club Montpellier, cutting the gap to PSG and Monaco who are separated by goal difference at the top of the table.Marseille will have the chance to draw level on points with PSG when they host their rivals next Sunday.""We know who we are, what our path is and what we still need to improve to reach their (PSG's) level. But we will prepare to win, like in every match,"" said De Zerbi, who took over at the Stade Velodrome in the close season after leaving Premier League club Brighton.The visitors got off to a flying start in Montpellier, as Elye Wahi nodded home Jonathan Rowe's header across goal in the first minute.Amine Harit added a second in the 36th minute, before Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg effectively wrapped up the points before half-time.Mason Greenwood collected Wahi's through ball and drove forward before picking out the bottom corner to score his first goal since August.Luis Henrique completed the scoring with 17 minutes left after Montpellier youngster Stefan Dzodic had been sent off.Montpellier sacked coach Michel Der Zakarian just a few minutes after the final whistle, with the team only on four points after eight matches.""He is no longer the coach of the first team. Given the performance and the attitudes of this evening, I felt obliged to intervene,"" said club president Laurent Nicollin.Earlier Sunday, Lyon notched a third straight win with a 4-0 thrashing of Le Havre.Reims missed a chance to climb into the top four as they lost 2-1 at Auxerre.",Barcelona rout Sevilla 5-1 to open three-point gap on Real Madrid in La Liga.

WOLVERHAMPTON (England): Manchester City defender John Stones headed a controversial stoppage-time winner in a 2-1 victory at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday that took them top of the Premier League and set a club record of 31 league games unbeaten.Champions City dominated possession from start to finish at Molineux, but were shocked in the seventh minute when a perfect cross from Nelson Semedo was met with a composed close-range finish by Wolves striker Jorgen Strand Larsen.Semedo missed a glorious chance to put Wolves further ahead in a one-on-one that Ederson saved, before City defender Josko Gvardiol picked up the ball in space and curled a beautiful shot past Jose Sa for a deserved 33rd-minute equaliser.Stones's late goal from a corner went to a Video Assistant Refereee (VAR) check for a possible offside by Bernardo Silva in front of the goalkeeper, but it was allowed, to the delight of their manager Pep Guardiola and travelling fans.""I'm really pleased to win in that fashion and get on the scoresheet again,"" said Stones, who also scored a late equaliser against Arsenal last month.""It was a tough game. I've got to give credit to Wolves, how they stopped us creating chances, made it difficult for us in the final third,"" he added.City moved top of the league on goal difference with 20 points, two above Liverpool who face Chelsea later on Sunday and could retake top spot with a win.Bottom on one point and without a win this season, Wolves are staring at a battle against relegation unless they can start picking up wins.Their manager Gary O'Neil was furious at the end of the game, after his team had defended valiantly against City who enjoyed three quarters of possession.Referee Chris Kavanagh initially disallowed Stones' goal, believing Silva had blocked goalkeeper Sa's line of vision, but VAR deemed that was not the case. When Kavanagh saw footage at the side of the pitch, he overturned the decision, bringing boos ringing round the ground from the home fans.",Manchester City beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-1 to go top of Premier League.

MANCHESTER (England): Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund got on the scoresheet as Manchester United bounced back after conceding a controversial goal to beat Brentford 2-1 at Old Trafford on Saturday for their first victory in more than a month.The win meant United climbed to 10th in the standings on 11 points after eight matches, and eased some of the pressure on beleaguered manager Erik ten Hag, whose job has been the subject of media speculation.Brentford are 12th on 10 points.United had 10 men on the pitch when Ethan Pinnock headed in Brentford's goal from a corner deep in first-half stoppage time after referee Sam Barrott instructed Matthijs de Ligt to go to the touchline to stem the bleeding from a gash on his head.The decision had Ten Hag and assistant Ruud van Nistelrooy shouting at the fourth official.But it seemed to fire up the home side, who dominated Brentford in a spirited second half, and Garnacho latched onto a cross from Marcus Rashford to fire home from the left side of the six-yard box into the far corner in the 47th minute.Hojlund put the home side ahead in spectacular fashion in the 62nd when Bruno Fernandes found him with a back-heel pass, and the Dane chipped the ball over goalkeeper Mark Flekken for his first league goal of the season.United had not won a game since a 7-0 League Cup rout of Barnsley on Sept. 17, and had not won a league game since a 3-0 victory at last-placed Southampton on Sept. 14.Brentford had scored inside the first two minutes in their previous four league matches.
