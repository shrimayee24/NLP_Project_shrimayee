The tile-high club: How mahjong became the hottest social currency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-tile-high-club-how-mahjong-became-the-hottest-social-currency/articleshow/123877909.cms,"Unexpected but true: Mumbai's elite have a new passion, and it's called mahjong! Living rooms and club lounges from Chembur to Churchgate echo with the clack-clack-clack of 144 tiles shuffling - a sound that has decisively dethroned the genteel clinking of silver tea services and the buzz of kitty parties. Forget idle gossip or the thrill of a Prada bag, the new badge of honour is slamming a tile declaring mahjong with the drama of a Bollywood climax.What began as a curious pastime, a let's-try-this diversion brought back from holidays in Singapore or Hong Kong a couple of years ago, has morphed into a full-blown, designer-clad, avocado-toast-fuelled obsession among women. Age and profession don't matter; an entire gamut of elite, be it the ladies that lunch, Bollywood actors, young mothers and even a multitude of working professionals have been drawn into its orbit. The weapons? Hand-crafted tiles of bone or even jade and gold. The armour? Statement Cartier bangles that risk damage with every aggressive move. The battlefield? An impeccably polished mahogany table where social capital is won and lost.The origins of mahjong are shrouded in mystery. Most historians agree the game was codified during China's Qing dynasty in the 19th century. But the romantic legends are far more entertaining.Some say Confucius himself developed the game, its three main suits - Bamboos, Characters, and Circles - symbolised the virtues he admired. Others insist it was a clever invention of a bored concubine trying to win an emperor's favour.By the 1920s, it had become a roaring craze in America. Articles from the time fretted over 'Mahjong Madness' as a dangerous addiction, a seductive Oriental diversion that was causing women to ignore other obligations. A headline from a 1923 edition of The New York Times might as well have been written about today's Mumbai: 'Society Women Abandon Bridge for Mahjong; Fear New Game Will Cause Neglect of Homes'.In India, it led a quieter life - in Kolkata's Chinatown where it was played in smoky, neon-lit clubs over steaming bowls of hakka noodles and chilli pork; in army cantonments where wives wielded strategy with the same precision as their officer husbands; and among the well-heeled and internationally travelled Indian upper classes.But like all fads, it faded till its dazzling revival in the last year when the contagion spread through Mumbai's drawing rooms with a velocity of a viral meme. One season, it was the quirky thing your cousin from Singapore did. The next, it was 'the' thing to do. From its South Mumbai epicentre, the tremor is radiating outward. Pune's leafy clubs have begun hosting mahjong tournaments alongside golf championships. Bengaluru's tech-world wives are swapping startup talk for tile strategies. And this has even spread to the guarded farmhouses of Delhi.In this new order, your status isn't your last name. It's your mahjong set. Starter sets made of lightweight plastic or bamboo tiles are treated with the same disdain as a fake Birkin. The intermediate player graduates to a weighty set of bone, the tiles clicking with a satisfying, authoritative tone. A lucky few have an ivory or a jade set in their collection. But the grand masters of this social game play on a different plane entirely. We are talking bespoke luxury sets crafted from malachite, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, and housed in leather cases that cost more than a family sedan. The latest additions are automatic, self-shuffling tables imported from China that whirr and hum, dealing perfect walls of tiles at the push of a button, effectively eliminating the one bit of manual labour of the afternoon.The refreshments match the sophistication of the game. In Mumbai, it's a parade of exotic hummus, truffle-infused arancini, sushi rolls crafted to look like miniature works of art, and gluten-free, sugar-free desserts that are photographed intensely before being nibbled. The peak of this foodie one-upmanship was a party where the cheese platter was meticulously carved into the shapes of the green and red dragon tiles. In Delhi, the approach is more robust: mini kebabs served on silver skewers, delicate kathi rolls, and paneer tikka. The conversation that flows around the game is fairly spicy -whose marriage is shaky, which builder is going bankrupt, which art gallery has the next big thing, and which doctor does the best non-surgical facelift.Clearly, a social sport would not be complete without fashion. Mahjong afternoons are as much about Louis Vuitton bags, Patek Philippe watches, Hermes scarves and chic co-ords (coordinated sets for the uninitiated) as they are about tiles. Food, fashion and fortune now sit comfortably at the same table.Even the hallowed, tradition-steeped halls of the Willingdon Club, a bastion of bridge, badminton, and complex membership rules echoing with the sound of clattering tiles. One can almost hear past presidents muttering into their favourite drink, ""We survived the British Raj, the permit era, and the new money, but by God, we couldn't survive the mahjong mania!""As it happens with any obsession, demand rapidly outpaces supply. So, mahjong instructors are more in demand than Bollywood fitness trainers and celebrity chefs, with wait lists stretching for months. These senseis of the tiles impart not just rules of the game but also its secret rhythms and advanced psychological warfare techniques. Their students form WhatsApp hives, buzzing at midnight with scoring queries and images of complex hands. The real bragging rights, however, belong to the circle that pools their resources to fly in a 'Master' from Macau or Hong Kong for a weekend retreat.For some, the game itself is secondary. This provides them the oldest currency of all: access. An invitation to the 'right' mahjong table is the new-age equivalent of making the cut for a private yacht party in Monaco or an exclusive pre-wedding sangeet in Udaipur. The mahjong table is a sealed universe of four. To be one of those four is a tacit announcement that you are 'in'. As one Mumbai hostess, a queen bee of the mahjong scene, confided with a wave of her bejewelled hand, ""It's not about the money, dahling. If you're not at my table on a Thursday, frankly, you don't exist."" Another Delhi socialite was even blunter: ""Mahjong is the new membership committee. It tells you who's rising, who's falling, and who's desperately trying to buy a set to get in.""This has not gone unnoticed by astute brands. The opening of a high-end jewellery store in the city recently featured not a champagne fountain, but four mahjong tables. The lure was simple: ""Play a hand, win a discount.""Curiously, men remain at the periphery of this revolution, retreating to their golf courses, poker games, and the new fad of padel. Perhaps the potent combination of intense strategy, endless gossip, and the requirement to sit still for three hours is a biological impossibility for the male species.So why has this particular game, above all others, captured the collective imagination so completely? The answer is simple: it combines skill, luck and endless conversation. It offers the thrill of competition without the brute force of sports. It's sophisticated enough to feel exclusive, yet social enough to make new friends. Above all, it fits beautifully into the rhythm of modern social life: it takes time, attention, and provides the perfect excuse to meet three times a week without guilt. What's there not to love?And in many ways, it mirrors our own journeys - from the ambition to build a winning hand, to the lessons of failures and missed chances, to the wisdom of patience and strategy, the exhilaration of seizing the right moment - and when all else fails, the quiet art of bluffing with confidence.The writer is chairman, RPG Enterprises","Mahjong began as a curious pastime, a let's-try-this diversion.

Mystery of Agatha Christie's India story finally solved,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mystery-of-agatha-christies-india-story-finally-solved/articleshow/123877784.cms,"Agatha Christie autographs copies of her books

WHY DIDN’T THEY ASK MATHEW? There was constant speculation over whether Agatha Christie ever came to India, but never any proof, even though she was known to be an avid traveller. Now, her grandson tells writer Manjiri Prabhu that she definitely had visited — not once, but twice

Mathew Prichard (also in photo right), who’s settled the India question once and for all, with his grandmother Agatha Christie

The following are extracts from two letters that Christie wrote to Edmund Cork in Cyprus, her literary agent and lifelong friend.

Jan 11, 1960 |

Jan 20, 1960 |

Another letter was from Christie, then staying at the Ashoka Hotel in New Delhi, to Rosalind, her daughter.

Feb 16, 1960 |

Oct 30, 1961 |

From Delhi, she wrote again to Rosalind.

Some mysteries need to be actively cracked, but some solve themselves with time.There has been constant speculation about Agatha Christie’s India connection. One question has recurred over the years, but has never really been accurately answered: did Agatha Christie ever visit India? The internet and popular belief will state that she did not. I, too, had often puzzled over how Christie, a world traveller, had never actually been to India. In fact, in a video in 2021, I had even concluded that she indeed hadn’t.Until one cool but sunny Easter day in Wales.In March 2024, I met Christie’s grandson, Mathew Prichard, and his lovely wife Lucy, at their charming home in Wales. Prichard, now in his 80s, had been very close to his grandmother.It was a memorable day, but it turned momentous when Mathew showed me Christie’s personal memorabilia — her passports, her first typed and edited manuscripts, rare photos, her camera, and her last portrait painting, which hung on one of the walls of his house.When Mathew signed and gifted me a copy of his grandmother’s latest biography, I also realised what a mammoth task he had been entrusted with — to preserve her legacy, and how he had upheld that trust: a proud grandson of the Queen of Crime.It was when I mentioned how strange it was that Christie had never visited India, that he glanced at me with a twinkle in his blue eyes, and said, “Oh, but she did!” I was startled. This was contrary to all that we believed. A few minutes later, as I skimmed through the numerous black-and-white, well-preserved photos, I found some that made my heart race — pictures of Christie with a garland, descending from an Indian Airlines plane. Here, finally, was the missing link to a long-standing puzzle.I was on the threshold of solving a real mystery, but I needed to know more. At my request, the archivist Joseph Keogh dug deeper and came up with some fascinating, unpublicised facts. Christie had indeed visited India — not once, but twice. From her passport stamps, he traced her travel itinerary for the two trips.Her first trip was in Jan 1960, when she visited Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka), then India and Pakistan. From Jan 11 to Feb 2, she travelled to Bombay (now Mumbai), headed to South India’s Madras (now Chennai), did some sightseeing at the Ajanta Caves, and then on to Delhi. Between Feb 2 and 9, she went to Nepal and returned to Patna and Delhi, finally leaving for Karachi on Feb 17.Some letters were also found that referenced her trips. It appeared that the 1960 trip was for a lecture tour by her second husband, the archaeologist Max Mallowan.Future plans are, roughly, leave for Madras today — go via southern India to Bombay arriving 17th or 18th — Then some sightseeing near Bombay Agenta Caves (sic) etc and on to Delhi and then to Nepal on Jan 31st for a week — c/o British Embassy would find us there as I’m not sure what the hotel is.Our plans are a bit different at the moment as accommodation at hotels is very hard to get exactly when one wants it but we shall be in and out of the Ashoka Hotel at Delhi between Jan 28th and Feb 2nd — and then Nepal (c/o British Embassy Kathmandu) 2nd to 9th then in and out of Ashoka again finally leaving it on Feb 17th for Karachi. So forward anything you think I ought to see to the Ashoka at Delhi — but nothing that I needn’t!!On our arrival here yesterday evening, several archaeologists were waiting with two porters and loads of archaeological material from their… dig. The examination of same intrigued the Ashoka guests very much.Christie’s second trip to India, a year later, seemed to be for leisure. The passport has a Palam, New Delhi stamp (month not specified) in 1961. This time she visited Srinagar in Kashmir and stayed at the Oberoi Palace. This is what she wrote to her daughter Rosalind:Lake and mountains rather lovely. This is a Hotel rather like at Jaipur — converted Rajah’s Palace — miles and miles of corridors — enormous rooms and we are in a kind of supersuite looking over lake. It’s all terribly dried up by this time of year — one ought really to come in May-June. Now one must be content by rich beds of red salvia and dahlias in the Hotel garden. Temp is about 50 at night. Delicious hot sun to sit in and about 60 in day. Suits me very well. We made some excursions — to the various Mogul gardens — and to a lake… which is very beautiful and ringed with snowclad mountains. You can see the mountains now after the rain. We have to leave here and go to the Hotel in the town — but expect that our booking for Nov 2nd to Delhi will be all right.Here we are in the Ashoka. I’m glad we had a good ten days and in a perfect Hotel for old ladies (very few of them nowadays) where I could sit, in the sun — and look at a view like a Japanese print. Lovely! The letters revealed Christie’s bright, chirpy personality and tongue-in-cheek humour, her eagerness to explore India and her appreciation of scenic beauty. She seemed happy to be in India.But I pondered why her trips were not well-known. Was it because photographs were a rarity then or because she checked into the hotels in her husband’s name — or perhaps simply because Agatha Christie was a private person?Whatever the reason, I was thrilled with my discovery. That sunny day with Mathew, Lucy and Gwynnie the dog carried an extra fulfilling zing because of this exciting revelation.I had always sensed a deep connection to Agatha Christie. But being the chosen one to unravel the mystery of her India trips felt truly special.The author is an award-winning writer of mystery novels[Extracts and photographs used with permission from Mathew Prichard and The Christie Archive Trust.

As India prepare to face Pakistan in the Asia Cup 2025 match at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on September 14, controversy surrounds the fixture. While some oppose India playing against Pakistan due to terrorism concerns, IPL team Punjab Kings took a unique stance by not mentioning Pakistan in their match announcement on social media.

This move sparked such intense reactions that the franchise had to disable comments on their X social media channel.The Supreme Court petition highlighted serious concerns about India-Pakistan cricket relations. The petitioners argued that playing cricket with Pakistan sends the wrong message, especially after recent terror attacks like Phalangam and Operation Sindoor where Indian soldiers lost their lives.The plea specifically stated: ""Cricket between nations is meant to show harmony and friendship. But after the Phalagam terror attack and Operation Sindoor, when our people died and our soldiers risked everything, playing with Pakistan sent the opposite message that while our soldiers sacrificed their lives, we are celebrating sports with the same country sheltering terrorists.""The petitioners expressed worry about hurting the sentiments of terror victims' families.They emphasised that national dignity and citizen security should take priority over entertainment. The petition claimed that such cricket matches could negatively impact the morale of armed forces and the nation.India-Pakistan cricket matches traditionally generate massive interest, not just for the sporting rivalry but also due to the complex political relationship between the two nations. The upcoming Dubai clash continues to spark debate about sports and politics in the sub-continent.India and Pakistan have both started their Asia Cup campaigns with wins.

Politics heats up over India-Pak Asia Cup match: Opposition corners Centre; BJP cites 'compulsion',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/politics-heats-up-over-india-pak-asia-cup-match-opposition-corners-centre-bjp-cites-compulsion/articleshow/123870097.cms,"Boycott Calls Grow Against India-Pakistan T20 Asia Cup Match After Pahalgam Victim Family’s Appeal

Shiv Sena (UBT) condemns the match, plans protest



BJP defends India’s participation



Political jabs between Maharashtra leaders



Congress terms the match a business, questions government morality



BJP, state leaders support team India



NEW DELHI: The upcoming India vs Pakistan clash in the Asia Cup 2025 is sparking political fireworks almost as fiercely as it promises to on the cricket field. Ahead of the high-stakes match, Shiv Sena (UBT) and Congress leaders have raised strong objections, labelling the fixture “shameless” and profit-driven, while BJP and allied state leaders have thrown their weight behind the Indian team, calling it a matter of national pride and ""compulsion to multilateral matches.""The criticism stems from India’s recent anti-terror operations against terrorists in Pakistan under Operation Sindoor, which the government said has been put on pause.The already-strained India-Pakistan relations dropped several notches lower after the deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam's Baisaran meadow that claimed 26 civilian lives. In retaliation, India launched cross-border strikes deep inside Pakistan and PoJK, targeting terror hotbeds in Pakistan's Bahawalpur and Muridke.Shiv Sena UBT chief Uddhav Thackeray questioned the morality of holding the match, saying, ""... Our Prime Minister said blood and water cannot flow together, then how can blood and cricket flow together. How can war and cricket be at the same time?... They have done business in patriotism. The business of patriotism is only for money. They are going to play the match tomorrow also because they want all the money they will get from that match...Tomorrow, Shiv Sena (UBT) women workers will come out on the streets in Maharashtra and they are going to send sindoor from every house to PM Modi. ..""Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut also criticised the decision, stating, ""...We will protest against this India-Pakistan cricket match. Women will come on the streets and our campaign is 'Sindoor Raksha Abhiyan'...You said that water and blood will not flow together. If water and blood will not flow together, then how will blood and cricket work together?...This is treason, shamelessness.""Raut further referred to ongoing grievances from past events, saying, ""Operation Sindoor has not ended yet, it is still going on. The sindoor of our 26 women was wiped off in Pahalgam. Their pain, grief, and anger have not ended. Even today, they are in shock. And you people are going to play cricket with Pakistan in Abu Dhabi. This is shamelessness, this is treason. My question is to the BJP, not to the government. My question is to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, RSS, Bajrang Dal. Do you have any role in this or not?...""BJP MP and former BCCI president Anurag Thakur explained, “In a multilateral tournament organised by the ACC or ICC, we have to play as it is compulsory for all countries. If we do not take part, we will be eliminated from the tournament as the opposition will get the points. But we do not play bilateral tournaments with Pakistan, and we will not play with them until they stop hurting us with the terrorism that flourishes there. ”Maharashtra minister Nitesh Rane took a dig at Shiv Sena MLA Aaditya Thackeray, mocking him for planning to attend the match, saying, ""Aaditya Thackeray will go silently to attend the match (upcoming India vs Pakistan match in Asia Cup 2025), wearing a burqa. His voice will also help him in this. After wearing a burqa, if he speaks in a woman's voice, people will believe him... No one would recognise that he is Aaditya Thackeray. ..""Rane also criticised Uddhav Thackeray, asking, ""Does Saamana or Uddhav Thackeray have the moral right to comment on the India-Pakistan match? During a rally of one of Uddhav Thackeray's MPs, slogans of 'Pakistan Zindabad' were raised, green flags were waved, green gulal was thrown, and slogans like 'sar tan se juda' were chanted. So, why didn't they express anger towards Pakistan then?""Congress MP Imraan Masood joined the criticism, framing the match as profit-driven: ""This is a business... The rights to broadcast it are sold at very high prices... They don't care about the fact that it's only been a few days since our sisters' 'sindoor' has been wiped off... This is not the first time; earlier, we did not send our hockey team either. They should not try to tell the rules... Those who wiped the 'sindoor' of our sisters, and you are going to play a match with them. You should be ashamed, and the government should also be ashamed that they do not have enough morality left in them that earlier they were saying that blood and water will not flow together, and now you are making them play cricket together.""In contrast, Haryana Sports minister Gaurav Gautam wished the Indian team success, saying, ""India has given a befitting reply to Pakistan on every front. I think India will emerge victorious here as well. Best wishes to our Indian players.""","The upcoming India vs Pakistan clash in the Asia Cup 2025 is sparking political fireworks almost as fiercely as it promises to on the cricket field.

Dwyane Wade has a huge net worth compared to his wife, Gabrielle Union



Dwyane Wade and his wife, Gabrielle Union, are multi millionaires and live pretty lavish lives that they can easily afford. Their marriage and relationship have inspired millions around the world. But it seems despite the money and fame, Dwyane Wade’s wife, Gabrielle Union still has issues with hospital care and the huge expenses that it brings along.A few months ago, Dwyane Wade’s wife and popular Hollywood actress, Gabrielle Union was on stage for “Sisterhood & Savings: A Conversation with Gabrielle Union” as she spoke about how she manages her money.Gabrielle Union opened up about the expenses that hospitals bring, despite having insurances.The popular actress said, “More recently, my father is in memory care…You know, nursing homes, what’s covered by insurance, what’s not, home health aids — like that all adds up and having to really be cognizant.”Gabrielle Union also added that despite living lavish lives, she still has to be very mindful of the roles she takes up because of the cheque it brings.Gabrielle Union added, “I don't have the luxury of taking all the independent films that I want because I can’t afford to pay for my extended family in the way that they have grown accustomed to...Ihave to go where the money goes.”This was something new, as not many Hollywood actors open up about the financial issues that they face in their lives because of their choice in films.While Dwyane Wade has not made any statements about it, the NBA legend has a net worth of a whopping $170 million, as per Celebrity Net Worth, as of February 2025.Gabrielle Union also has an impressive net worth of $40 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.However, a few months ago, the popular Hollywood actress made it pretty clear that the two are of a 50-50 mindset and equally divide all their expenses.This statement had raised many eyebrows but both Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union remain deeply in love with each other as they have been together for over a decade now.Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union met after they separated in their respective first marriages and ended up dating for a couple of years until they tied the knot in 2014.

NFL’s lack of consistency compared to past public statements drew more criticism



The Green Bay Packers and the NFL held a moment of silence for conservative activist Charlie Kirk before Thursday Night Football against the Washington Commanders at Lambeau Field. Kirk, 31, was shot and killed Wednesday during a speaking event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.The tribute took place about 25 minutes before kickoff. The in-stadium announcement said, “The National Football League asks that you please join us in a moment of silent reflection following the murder of Charlie Kirk. The NFL condemns all violence in our communities. It will take all of us to stop hate. Thank you.”Former President Donald Trump confirmed Kirk’s death on Wednesday and later said he would posthumously award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The FBI released a photo of a person of interest Thursday, but no arrests have been made.Fox News senior NFL writer Armando Salguero shared video of the silence. The MLFootball account also circulated the clip, describing the moment as a league-wide honor. Critics, however, said the execution fell flat.One frustrated fan in attendance wrote, “They did it when the stadium wasn’t even half full half an hour ago, and it went right to. It was terrible.” Another attendee added, “It was ridiculous; they didn’t even display it on the jumbotron.”On social media, the pushback was even stronger. One user posted, “We doing for just anyone now? There was a school shooting yesterday (AND today) AND a shooting at a US naval academy but I guess that’s not important.” Another wrote, “That wasn’t even a moment. Couldn’t even count one second of silence.”The NFL’s silence in the immediate aftermath of Kirk’s assassination frustrated many. The league has issued statements in the past on events such as the killing of George Floyd and support for LGBTQ rights. The absence of a message for Kirk led some to accuse the NFL of picking and choosing when to speak up.Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker posted Kirk’s final text message, calling him a “strong witness for Christ.” Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson also paid tribute, as did New York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, who wrote, “Praying for him and his family. Charlie did great things for our country!! Political Violence NEEDS TO STOP!! Pray for our country man. This is disgusting and Sad!!”ESPN analyst Pat McAfee called the shooting “startling, saddening, and maddening.” Former NFL players Tim Tebow and Julian Edelman also acknowledged Kirk’s death.Former NFL punter Chris Kluwe, on the other hand, stirred controversy on BlueSky this week after the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Kluwe, who earlier this year lost his job as a high school football coach for calling the MAGA movement “Nazi,” posted a profanity-laced message backing Sen. Elizabeth Warren for rejecting claims that Democratic rhetoric had fueled the attack. In his post, Kluwe argued that Republicans are responsible for the hostile climate, writing that they “could stop it at any time” and shouldn’t be treated like “children. ”Outside football, the New York Yankees held a moment of silence before their Wednesday game against the Detroit Tigers. Trump later appeared at Yankee Stadium during a separate 9/11 ceremony.","Green Bay Packers and NFL held a moment of silence for conservative activist Charlie Kirk before Thursday Night Football against the Washington Commanders at Lambeau Field.

Lions safety Brian Branch fined twice for one play as head coach Dan Campbell faces tough roster test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/lions-safety-brian-branch-fined-twice-for-one-play-as-head-coach-dan-campbell-faces-tough-roster-test/articleshow/123878000.cms,"Dan Campbell (Image via Getty)

Rising pattern of penalties casts shadow on talent

Jameson Williams also hit with taunting fine

Campbell juggles injuries and roster depth concerns

Detroit Lions safety Brian Branch was handed a painful lesson in discipline this week after one fiery play drew two separate fines. The NFL docked him $23,186 for facemasking and taunting during the clash with the Green Bay Packers, a moment that not only hurt the scoreboard but also added to head coach Dan Campbell’s growing roster headaches early in the season.The controversy erupted late in the first quarter when Branch pulled down Packers tight end Tucker Kraft near the sideline. In the aftermath, he grabbed Kraft’s facemask, then ripped off his own helmet and hurled it to the ground in frustration. Officials immediately flagged him for unsportsmanlike conduct, but the league went further, issuing two separate fines of $11,593 each for unnecessary roughness and taunting.This is far from Branch’s first brush with league discipline. According to NFL records, the Lions’ safety has now accumulated $118,391 in fines since entering the league in 2023. Last season alone, he topped Detroit’s fine sheet with $70,896, showing a worrying pattern for a young player whose talent has been overshadowed by costly lapses in composure. Wide receiver Jameson Williams also drew a fine of $11,593 for taunting in Week 1, adding to Detroit’s growing list of avoidable penalties.For head coach Dan Campbell, the timing could hardly be trickier. While he addresses lapses in discipline, the Lions are also navigating injuries that have stretched roster depth early in the season. With veterans battling fitness concerns and limited offensive line options, Detroit’s margin for error has narrowed even further. The dual challenge of keeping players healthy and disciplined looms large for a team with playoff ambitions.For the Lions, the convergence of mounting fines and nagging injuries is more than a headline—it’s a test of composure and depth as the season grinds forward. Branch’s flare-up reflects a team fighting with raw intensity, but one that must learn to channel aggression without bleeding yards and dollars. As Campbell reshuffles his roster, Detroit knows that lessons in discipline and durability must come quickly if they want to stay ahead in a competitive NFC race.Also read: Why Green Bay Packers rookie WR Savion Williams’ helmet looks noticeably larger on field","Detroit Lions safety Brian Branch was handed a painful lesson in discipline this week.

Why Patrick Mahomes may lean on Tyquan Thornton as his newest reliable target following Xavier Worthy’s injury,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-patrick-mahomes-may-lean-on-tyquan-thornton-as-his-newest-reliable-target-following-xavier-worthys-injury/articleshow/123877679.cms,"Tyquan Thornton emerging as key target in the Chiefs’ wide receiver room (Getty Images)

The Chiefs’ wide receiver room is wide open



How the Chiefs landed Tyquan Thornton



The Kansas City Chiefs suddenly find themselves searching for reliable options in the passing game. With rookie sensation Xavier Worthy sidelined by a shoulder injury and Rashee Rice suspended until Week 7, Patrick Mahomes is left with a thinner list of playmakers. That has opened the door for Tyquan Thornton, a wideout once considered a forgotten prospect, who is now seizing his opportunity in Kansas City.Thornton stepped into a bigger role against the Chargers, finishing with two catches for 41 yards on four targets. While his stat line wasn’t eye-popping, his 38-yard reception before halftime stood out as the longest play of the first half and a spark for the offense. Mahomes acknowledged the impact, saying, “Once I hit that one to Tyquan down the sideline towards halftime, I thought from then on I did a good job of recognizing when to take shots. ”Head coach Andy Reid had already hinted before the game that Hollywood Brown and Thornton would be filling the void left by Rice. Worthy’s injury made that responsibility even heavier, but Thornton showed he was ready. Reid praised his skill set, noting, “He’s fast, he’s a big target, and he runs good routes.”Thornton’s road to Kansas City has been anything but smooth. Drafted 50th overall by the New England Patriots in 2022 after blazing a 4.28 40-yard dash, he never found consistency in Foxborough.Injuries and questions about his hands derailed his time there, leading to his release in late 2024.The Chiefs, however, saw something different. They quickly added him to the practice squad, then signed him to a future contract in February 2025. Reid even revealed that Bill Belichick had vouched for him, telling Kansas City’s staff that Thornton “really got great potential.”Now, with a clear path to playing time, Thornton has the chance to prove Belichick right and reward the Chiefs’ patience. For Kansas City, it could mean finding an unexpected weapon just when Mahomes needs it most.Thornton’s journey from overlooked Patriot to trusted target in Kansas City is far from complete, but the early signs suggest the Chiefs may have uncovered a diamond in the rough.Also Read: Why Giants are not rushing to bench Russell Wilson as rookie Jaxson Dart draws increasing attention",Tyquan Thornton was drafted 50th overall by the New England Patriots in 2022.

Mac Jones calls early San Francisco 49ers start a pivotal moment in his NFL career

The San Francisco 49ers are counting on quarterback Mac Jones to step up during a vital Week 2 away game against the New Orleans Saints on September 14, 2025, at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. With starting quarterback Brock Purdy out with a toe injury from Week 1, the team is depending on Jones ' grit and competitive nature to handle a tough challenge and secure a win early in the season. This moment is crucial as the San Francisco 49ers look to build some momentum in the young 2025 NFL season, facing a Saints team with rookie quarterback Spencer Rattler at the helm.The word about Purdy's absence and Jones' promotion trickled out gradually, starting with some cautious updates before the full confirmation came in. On September 11, 2025, 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan took to the media during a press conference in Santa Clara, California, stating that Purdy was feeling sore and would be restricted in practice.This initial comment broke the quiet on the quarterback situation, igniting speculation about the backups, with Jones rising as the leading candidate due to his experience over the other alternatives.The following day, September 12, 2025, more details came to light when Shanahan officially announced that Purdy was out during another media session at the team's facility.He told reporters that Jones would be the starter, highlighting the quarterback's preparation with the first-team offense all week. Shanahan stated, ""Mac's been impressive since he got here, and he's run the offense well this week."".By September 13, 2025, player interviews and practice reports revealed more insights. Following Friday's practice in Santa Clara, Jones talked to reporters about his mindset. Comments from teammates and coaches emphasized team chemistry, with wide receiver Kendrick Bourne recalling their past connection from New England, as mentioned in a post-practice huddle reported by Niners Nation, ""Mac and I have that chemistry — it's been strong historically. ""Jones has shown gratitude for this opportunity, seeing it as a key moment in his career. Jones told reporter Grant Cohn, ""I feel fortunate to have this opportunity so early in the season. I think it's all part of God's plan."".Jones told Akash Anavarathan, ""I've been working for this moment. It's been up and down, but I'm ready to lead."" This statement underscores his grit, drawing from experiences in New England and Jacksonville where he faced benchings and trades.Jones talked about how ready he is in a YouTube video interview on September 12, 2025, with the 49ers team media, speaking directly to the camera, ""I feel prepared for my first 49ers start.

Russell Wilson remains the starter for now



Giants’ timeline could determine Wilson’s fate



The New York Giants’ 21–6 loss to the Commanders was frustrating for fans, but the team is not rushing into a quarterback switch. According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, the Giants have “no sense of urgency” to bench Russell Wilson in favor of rookie Jaxson Dart. For now, patience seems to be their strategy, even as pressure builds around the decision.Wilson’s performance in the opener left much to be desired. He completed just 17 of 37 passes for 168 yards, failing to find rhythm through the air. Ironically, he was also New York’s leading rusher, scrambling for 44 yards on eight carries. The veteran’s struggles have fueled speculation about when Dart, the promising rookie out of Ole Miss, might get his chance.Dart impressed in the preseason, tossing a touchdown in every exhibition game and flashing the same efficiency that made him the FBS leader last year. Drafted 25th overall, his arrival sparked curiosity about how long the Giants would lean on Wilson before turning to the future. Yet, as Schefter explained, “It doesn’t mean a change can’t come soon at the quarterback position, but the Giants would prefer that it not happen anytime soon. ”New York’s upcoming schedule offers little breathing room. They face the Cowboys on Sunday, followed by heavyweight clashes against the Chiefs and Chargers.Some insiders suggest Week 5 against the Saints, or after their mini-bye in Week 6, could be a logical window to insert Dart.The Giants’ history shows they are not afraid to make bold calls. In 2004, they benched Kurt Warner despite a winning record to hand the reins to rookie Eli Manning. That precedent looms over Wilson’s situation, reminding fans that patience has limits.There is also a wild card in Jameis Winston, who could serve as a bridge if Wilson falters and the staff feels Dart isn’t quite ready. For now, though, the Giants appear committed to Wilson, at least until the right moment arrives.The message is clear: the Giants are backing Russell Wilson—for now.

Why the Dolphins could move on from Tua Tagovailoa

What makes LaNorris Sellers a top prospect

The Miami Dolphins are facing a pivotal moment this season as questions swirl around the future of quarterback Tua Tagovailoa . After missing the playoffs in 2024 and dealing with internal team turmoil—including a players-only meeting following a blowout loss—many believe major changes are coming in 2026.Tua Tagovailoa, now in his sixth year as Miami’s starter, has shown flashes of brilliance but failed to lead the team past mediocrity. Ongoing health concerns, particularly multiple concussions, further cloud his future. With his massive contract making a trade or cut complicated until 2027, the Dolphins face a strategic dilemma.Pro Football & Sports Network’s James Fragoza predicts the Dolphins will use their projected No. 10 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft to select South Carolina quarterback LaNorris Sellers. Fragoza says, “Sellers possesses one of the highest ceilings in the entire 2026 NFL Draft QB class and is trending upward on the operational side of his game.”Standing 6’3″ and weighing 242 pounds, Sellers offers an elite combination of arm strength and mobility. His ability to launch 70-yard throws and make plays with his legs makes him a dynamic prospect.In his first full season as a starter in 2024, Sellers completed 65.6% of his passes for 2,534 yards and 18 touchdowns, while rushing for 674 yards and adding seven scores on the ground.Despite his upside, Sellers remains raw and in need of development. Fragoza notes that “he’s also the complete opposite of Tua Tagovailoa from a prospect point of view, which the Dolphins may want.” Whether Sellers enters the draft or stays another year remains to be seen, but his potential is undeniable.As the 2025 season unfolds, Miami’s front office will be under increasing pressure to plan for life after Tua.Also Read: Warriors’ Draymond Green delivers cold reality check to Josh Allen believers after epic Bills comeback: “He's not the guy”",South Carolina quarterback LaNorris Sellers is a top prospect in the 2026 NFL Draft.

The context behind the NFL’s decision to honor Charlie Kirk

MLB , NHL, NBA responses and controversy in Carolina Panthers

The NFL has left the decision up to individual teams on whether to hold tributes to Charlie Kirk ahead of games this Sunday, following a recent moment of silence during the Green Bay Packers vs. Washington Commanders game. The league’s statement said, “Last night’s moment was the league’s decision. It’s up to the clubs for this Sunday’s games,” highlighting its intention to allow flexibility while recognizing the sensitive nature of the tribute.Charlie Kirk’s assassination shocked the nation and generated a wave of tributes across various sports leagues. The NFL’s statement placed this moment of silence in context with past practices, noting similar actions taken after tragedies such as school shootings, the attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, and international events like the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023.Additionally, the NFL referenced past tributes, including the honoring of Damar Hamlin in 2023, as well as commemorations for Kobe Bryant and victims of a helicopter crash before Super Bowl LIV. “Lift Every Voice and Sing has been performed at league events since 2020 following the murder of George Floyd,” the statement noted, reflecting a broader effort to respond sensitively to national and personal tragedies.While the NFL and Major League Baseball have acknowledged the assassination—MLB requiring all teams to fly flags at half-staff this weekend—other leagues like the NHL, NBA, and WNBA have remained silent, with no official statements issued.Meanwhile, the Carolina Panthers acted swiftly, firing Charlie Rock from their communications department after his social media comments questioned public grief over Kirk’s assassination. The team emphasized, “The views expressed by our employees are their own and do not represent those of the Carolina Panthers… We do not condone violence of any kind.”Also Read: NFL clarifies decision to observe moment of silence for Charlie Kirk during Packers-Commanders game This decision reflects the high sensitivity surrounding Kirk’s death and the broader debate over how public figures and organizations should respond to tragic events.",The NFL has left the decision up to individual teams on whether to hold tributes to Charlie Kirk ahead of games this Sunday.

Andy Reid confirms Xavier Worthy will not play

What this means for Kansas City’s offensive strategy



The Kansas City Chiefs are heading into their crucial Week 2 matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles without one of their most exciting offensive weapons. Rookie wide receiver Xavier Worthy, who has quickly become a key contributor, will be sidelined due to a lingering knee issue, creating challenges for the team’s game plan.Speaking to the media ahead of the primetime clash, head coach Andy Reid addressed Xavier Worthy’s status. “He’s not going to play. His knee is still tender,” Reid revealed. “We’ll just see where it goes from here.” The announcement confirms growing concerns around the young receiver, who has shown the ability to stretch defenses vertically and provide explosive plays for quarterback Patrick Mahomes.Drafted in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft from Texas, Worthy was expected to be a game-changing addition to the Chiefs’ offense. His blazing speed and deep-threat ability have made him a perfect complement to Travis Kelce and the rest of the receiving corps. Unfortunately, the injury has stalled his momentum at a critical point in the season.Worthy’s absence puts extra pressure on the Chiefs’ offense, especially with the Eagles boasting one of the NFL’s toughest defensive lines. Without Worthy drawing coverage downfield, opponents are likely to focus more on shutting down Kelce, Patrick Mahomes’s most trusted target.That shifts the spotlight onto other receivers like Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Rashee Rice to step up in high-pressure situations.For Mahomes, this presents a delicate balancing act between patience and aggressive playmaking. With fewer vertical threats to stretch the defense, the Chiefs may have to rely more on short and intermediate passes, or innovative play-calling from Reid.Also Read: Why Eagles-Chiefs Super Bowl rematch might become the most-watched NFL September game in television history As the rivalry heats up, the focus now turns to how quickly Xavier Worthy can recover, and whether the Chiefs can adapt and still come out on top.",Andy Reid confirms Xavier Worthy will not play against the Philadelphia Eagles.

Why New Jersey could be the perfect fit for Kirill Kaprizov

What it could take to land the star winger



The New Jersey Devils are quietly emerging as one of the most intriguing teams to watch this NHL offseason, thanks to swirling trade rumors surrounding Minnesota Wild superstar Kirill Kaprizov. After unexpectedly declining a massive contract extension from the Wild, Kaprizov’s future now seems uncertain, igniting widespread speculation about where he could land next.With a strong core already in place, including talented forward Jack Hughes, the Devils are well-positioned for a major leap toward genuine Stanley Cup contention. Kirill Kaprizov, known for his electrifying offensive skills and ability to change the outcome of games single-handedly, would be the ideal addition to push New Jersey over the top. Pairing Kaprizov and Hughes would create one of the most dangerous offensive duos in the NHL, forcing opposing defenses into constant trouble.New Jersey’s front office has shown an aggressive approach in recent seasons, indicating a willingness to make bold moves to strengthen the roster. Given that many Eastern Conference rivals face their own off-season challenges, this could be a golden opportunity for the Devils to strike while the iron is hot.The Minnesota Wild will not part ways with Kaprizov lightly. Reports suggest that a significant trade package would be required, likely including top prospects, established players, or high draft picks. However, if the Wild sense that Kaprizov is determined to leave, they might have no choice but to negotiate.Kaprizov himself remains the wild card. His next move will likely hinge on personal ambitions, team direction, and market appeal. As the situation remains fluid, one thing is clear—New Jersey’s management should monitor this closely. Adding Kaprizov could instantly make the Devils favorites in the East and signal their serious intent to compete at the highest level.In the words of many insiders, “When healthy, Kaprizov is one of the best players in the entire NHL.” That alone makes this a story worth following closely this fall.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Nazem Kadri positioned as valuable trade asset amid Calgary Flames’ playoff drought","The New Jersey Devils are quietly emerging as one of the most intriguing teams to watch this NHL offseason.

The gust of boycott wind around the India vs Pakistan Asia Cup clash has made its way into the Indian dressing room.TimesofIndia.com can confirm that the players had a long conversation with head coach Gautam Gambhir and other support staff, with questions swirling far beyond the boundary rope.The players have been told to stay professional and take the match just like any other. But can they?It is a young team, with most of the cricketers keeping tabs on social media the moment they get their phones back after an intensive net session. They are professionals, but they too were shaken during the border skirmish between the two countries in May, and now with the calls for boycott in the backdrop.The tension can be sensed, as ahead of a big match like this, neither the head coach, captain nor any player came for the pre-match press conference.On the eve of the match, India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate was asked if players would be carrying the sentiments of a wounded public.He replied: ""Yes, I think they will.""It is a very sensitive issue. I have no doubt the players share the compassion and feelings of the vast majority of the Indian public. The Asia Cup was in limbo for a long period of time and we were just waiting.""We didn’t think we were going to be coming at one stage. But obviously, you know what the government’s stance is.Now the team, particularly the players, have to put their sentiments and emotions behind,"" he added.The Dutch coach later admitted that the team did go into a huddle on Saturday and addressed the situation in the team meeting.""We’re aware of people’s feelings. At the same time, we will put it behind us and the guys will get a chance to play for their country again tomorrow. They will be as professional and focused as they can be given the circumstances,"" he said.Ryan ten Doeschate discovered how India vs Pakistan begins long before the first ball.His face often slipped into a void of expression, his silences dragging longer than comfort allowed, each word measured as if it carried the weight of a landmine. In real time, he was discovering that India-Pakistan cricket is never merely a game; it is a battlefield disguised as sport.""I guess the other side of the argument is that you separate sport from politics, and people have got different opinions on that. Hopefully the way we play can represent how we feel about the country,"" he said.""I understand the position and, like I explained, the sentiment, but we are following the direction of what the BCCI and the Indian government have decided is right for the country at the moment.""This will be ten Doeschate’s second India-Pakistan match. It was in Dubai that he first tasted the rivalry during the Champions Trophy earlier this year.When coaxed about whether there was anything different in preparation, he said:""I will be honest, no. I was expecting a lot more needle during the Champions Trophy game, and I didn’t really feel that either. The preparation or focus hasn’t been any different to any other important game. Pakistan has also started to come to terms with how they want to play T20 cricket. So it’s going to be a slightly different challenge compared to the last 24 months. We want to focus on what we are doing and how we want to play.""Ten Doeschate had survived the press conference, and before signing off, revealed coach Gautam Gambhir’s message to his team ahead of the clash.""We obviously are aware of the sentiments and the strong feelings. And Gauti’s message has just been very professional about not worrying about things that are not in our control.""Just trying to be emotionless when approaching the cricket side of things. The guys are professional enough now. I’m sure individuals have different levels of feeling on the spectrum of where they feel the whole situation is. But the messaging has been to just focus on the cricket and try to just focus on the one game tomorrow.""Whoever wins the match on Sunday, one thing is for sure: the India-Pakistan rivalry has been reignited. Yes, it has lost some flair; the cricket is trying to serve as a stage, but the play is stretching far beyond it.",India face Pakistan in the Asia Cup final in Dubai on Sunday. India's assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate says players will carry the sentiments of a wounded public.

Shubman Gill is hit in the nets before the crucial match against Pakistan in Asia Cup

The India-Pakistan contest is where legends are made and hearts are broken. Beyond sheer skill, it’s the temperament, nerves and the ability to seize defining moments that decide the victor.Every duel on the field is a battle within a battle. The captains, Suryakumar Yadav and Salman Ali Agha, have already hinted that their teams will play with fire.Former Pakistan cricketers have already sharpened their swords. Shoaib Akhtar, on PTV Sports, said: ""Emotions are running really high, we are meeting India post-war.""However, in Dubai there is no such animosity in the air.Mohammad Shehzad, who hails from Multan, has been working as a cricket coach at the ICC Cricket Academy for the past decade. He proudly calls himself ""Multan ka Sultan"" and is adored by his students.""Yahaan India-Pakistan bhai bhai hai (There is no animosity here between Indians and Pakistanis). We live here like one community. Most of my students at the academy are Indians. For most, I am Shehzad chacha, chachu or sometimes chax also,"" he laughs, while finishing his dinner around 10 pm (Dubai local time) at the ICC Cricket Academy.He says that in the past, India-Pakistan matches were not ideal for the faint-hearted, but now he feels this match could turn out to be a one-sided affair.""We are no longer cornered tigers. I think India are too strong a side. I am afraid it will be one-sided,"" he says.Shehzad is also responsible for arranging fast bowlers for the team’s training at the ICC Academy, and most of the fast bowlers he gets are from Pakistan.One of them, Sufiyan, from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region, was also having dinner, and he politely disagrees with Shehzad.""Babar ko drop kar ke bahut badi galti kar di hai (By dropping Babar, they have committed a big mistake),"" he quips.Razzaq, another fast bowler from Bahawalpur, chimes in: ""Let's finish our dinner, we need to catch the shuttle for Sharjah."" He, however, disagrees with his friend: ""We are better without Babar.""Shehzad, smiling and offering biryani to this reporter, reveals the struggle of the Pakistani expat.""It’s tough for them. Both of them work as security guards in Dubai Mall in the morning. In the evening, they come here to train. Cricket is in their veins. There are many like them who have played cricket at U-19 level in Pakistan and after that had to quit or move abroad to earn money,"" he says.India are clearly going into the match as favourites. Will the Salman Ali Agha-led team, well known as cricket’s perpetual ""cornered tigers,"" be able to turn the tables against the mighty Indians?On paper, it looks like one-way traffic, but one can never take the Pakistan cricket team lightly.The current bunch of cricketers have been denounced, rejected and ridiculed. The selectors, coaches and captains have been changed in recent times like a game of musical chairs.Saim Ayub, one of the brightest stars in the current Pakistan side, is taking the India match like any other game. ""It is going to be a big match for the people. We do not see it like this as a team. We see that we follow the same process day by day in the next match,"" he told reporters after Pakistan’s convincing 93-run win over Oman in Dubai.The youngster also pointed out that this team does not bother about the past.""I think this is the message of our team management for the last 3-4 months. The most important thing is to learn from the past and move forward. We don’t want to remember the past and don’t want to focus too much on the future,"" he said.""Memories do not matter. This tournament matters the most.""We are not just looking forward to the Pakistan-India match. We are looking forward to winning the tournament,"" he added.Saim is fearless, an enigma the greats of the game can’t stop talking about. But the burning question remains: can he transform raw talent into timeless greatness? And what grander stage to script that destiny than under the blinding lights of a showdown against the arch-rivals?Brace yourself, we will get all the answers on Sunday.","India take on Pakistan in Asia Cup quarter-final in Dubai on Friday.

Shubman Gill injury update, who came for optional nets and mood before Pakistan match

Shubman Gill is hit in the nets before the crucial match against Pakistan in Asia Cup

NEW DELHI: Arch-rivals India and Pakistan are gearing up for a high-voltage showdown in the Asia Cup 2025 group stage at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday. This clash is already a headline event, but an intriguing subplot has added extra spice: the face-off between India’s batting star Shubman Gill and Pakistan’s spinner Abrar Ahmed The last time these two sides met was at the same venue earlier this year during the ICC Champions Trophy 2025. India won that contest by six wickets before going on to lift the trophy. But what made the night unforgettable for fans was Abrar Ahmed’s dismissal of Shubman Gill — a wicket that sparked one of the most talked-about moments of the tournament.Gill, batting fluently on 46 off 52 balls, was undone by an absolute peach of a leg-break in the 18th over. The ball drifted in, ripped past his defence, and crashed into the stumps, leaving even Virat Kohli at the non-striker’s end in awe. As Gill stood in disbelief, Abrar gave him a pointed send-off, signalling him to walk back. The gesture instantly went viral, dividing fans across the cricketing spectrum — some calling it fiery passion, others branding it unsporting.Now, as the two teams lock horns again under the floodlights in Dubai, the big question is: who will have the last laugh this time? Can Gill settle scores with his bat, or will Abrar once again spin a web around him?Adding to the drama, Gill gave Indian fans a scare during Saturday’s training session.A rising delivery struck him on the hand, forcing him to briefly leave the nets in discomfort. Vice-captain Gill was seen icing his hand with physios keeping a close watch, while teammates Suryakumar Yadav and Abhishek Sharma checked on him. Thankfully, the scare was short-lived. Gill returned to bat again and ended the session in full flow, even stopping to greet Abhishek’s father on his way out.With political tension in the backdrop and cricketing history at stake, the Gill vs Abrar rivalry has become the talking point ahead of the Asia Cup blockbuster. Sunday’s clash promises not just another India-Pakistan thriller, but also the next chapter in a duel that fans will be watching with bated breath.",India face Pakistan in the Asia Cup 2025 group stage on Sunday.

Steven Bergwijn leads Al Ittihad attack



Predrag Rajkovic 's red card changes the momentum



Muhannad Al Shanqeeti seals dramatic late win



Al Ittihad showed they can win without Karim Benzema . In their first home game of the Saudi Pro League season, the defending champions beat Al Fateh 4-2. Steven Bergwijn scored twice, while Laurent Blanc’s side handled a dramatic contest filled with goals and red cards.Benzema, who scored a hat-trick in the opening week, was unavailable due to injury. That left space for Steven Bergwijn to step up.The Dutch forward delivered, scoring in the 35th and 39th minutes. His first goal gave Al Ittihad a 2-1 lead, and his second doubled the advantage before halftime. It was a reminder of his impact last season and showed he can carry the team when Benzema is missing.Before Bergwijn’s goals, Houssem Aouar had opened the scoring in the 22nd minute. Al Fateh responded quickly through Matias Vargas, leveling the game at 1-1. But Bergwijn’s brace shifted control toward the champions. Al Fateh’s Mourad Batna was then sent off before the break, leaving his side with a steep challenge.The game turned again after halftime. Al Ittihad goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic received a red card for fouling Fahad Al Zubaidi inside the box.That dismissal gave Al Fateh hope, and Sofiane Bendebka converted the penalty in the 69th minute to make it 3-2.Suddenly, the two-goal cushion was gone. And tension grew inside Alinma Stadium.For a short spell, Al Fateh looked capable of stealing a point. With both sides reduced to ten men, the contest became wide open, and mistakes at the back could have punished either team.Al Ittihad eventually settled nerves in stoppage time. Muhannad Al Shanqeeti scored the fourth goal, confirming a 4-2 victory.The defending champions now have six points from their first two games, scoring nine goals in the process. Bergwijn’s finishing, combined with Blanc’s tactical management, underlined that this squad has multiple attacking threats beyond Benzema.Elsewhere in the Saudi Pro League on Friday, Al Ahli played a goalless draw against Al Ettifaq.

Nepal violence: How Ghaziabad man’s 15-hour search for wife ended in Kathmandu morgue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/nepal-violence-how-ghaziabad-mans-15-hour-search-for-wife-ended-in-kathmandu-morgue/articleshow/123859211.cms,"



GHAZIABAD: As flames licked the night sky and chaos erupted on the streets of Kathmandu, Ramveer Dola found himself in a nightmare he could never have imagined.For Ramveer and his wife Rajesh, it began as a vacation filled with temple visits and quiet moments. But in hours, it turned into a harrowing race for survival — a story of separation, frantic hope, and a devastating loss.The couple from Ghaziabad had arrived in Kathmandu on Sept 7, planning to explore the capital city and pay their respects at the Pashupatinath temple. They checked into a room on the fourth floor of Hyatt Regency, unaware that the city was on the brink of turmoil. On Sept 9, after a day of sightseeing, Ramveer and Rajesh returned to their hotel, exhausted but content.But as night fell, the city's simmering unrest exploded. Protests against the Nepal govt, sparked by a controversial social media ban and deep political dissatisfaction, spiralled into violence.By 11.30pm, a mob had set Hyatt Regency ablaze. Trapped on the upper floors, Ramveer and Rajesh faced a terrifying choice — stay and risk the fire, or attempt a perilous escape. ""Scared, my mother told my father, ‘let's leave from here.Or, we won't survive',"" the couple's son, Vishal, told TOI.Thinking quickly, Ramveer smashed the window pane and threw their mattress to the ground below. He knotted together bedsheets and curtains to fashion a makeshift rope. Rajesh, still recovering from a hand injury sustained during the Mahakumbh earlier this year, began her descent first.But as she reached the second floor, her grip failed. She fell, striking her back and head on the concrete below. Ramveer followed, injured but alive, and rushed to his wife's side.In the chaos outside, an Army truck arrived and took an injured Rajesh in. Ramveer pleaded with the soldiers to let him accompany his wife to hospital, but they refused, even though there was space.""When the Nepal military separated me and my wife, I thought I would never see her again,"" Ramveer later recounted. Desperate, he found a local resident willing to help him follow the Army vehicle on a scooter. But a flat tyre delayed them. By the time Ramveer reached the nearest Army camp, he was denied entry until a relative in the Indian Air Force intervened.Rajesh, meanwhile, was nowhere to be found. The family, with the help of the Indian Embassy and local contacts, circulated her photo across Kathmandu, searching hospitals and camps. Ramveer — exhausted and injured — moved from one pillar to another, clinging on to hope.On the morning of Sept 10, he learnt that the injured from Hyatt had been taken to Veer and Teaching hospitals. At Veer Hospital, there was no sign of Rajesh. It was only at Teaching Hospital, after around 15 hours of search at 3pm, that Ramveer received the crushing news — his wife had succumbed to her injuries and her body was lying there.The ordeal did not end there. With flights grounded and the city under curfew, bringing Rajesh's body home became another struggle.Local helpers, though charging hefty amounts for their services, assisted Ramveer in arranging an ambulance to the Sunauli border. From there, the family hired another ambulance and drove through the night to Ghaziabad, where Rajesh's body arrived on Friday morning and was cremated in the presence of relatives.The Dola family's tragedy is not an isolated one. As protests swept Kathmandu, at least 200 from Andhra Pradesh and dozens from other states were stranded in Nepal.",Ramveer Dola and his wife Rajesh were trapped in their hotel during the Kathmandu protests. Rajesh fell to her death on the second floor of the Hyatt Regency. Ramveer was separated from his wife by the Nepal military.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123863097,imgsize-51342,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/the-couple-from-ghaziabad-had-arrived-in-kathmandu-on-sept-7-planning-to-explore-the-capital-city-and-pay-their-respects-at-the-pashupatinath-temple.jpg"

Team form, key players, and what to expect

The marquee team, Al-Ittihad, will be hosting Al-Fateh in Round 2 of the 2025–26 Saudi Pro League, where both teams will give it a fight. The defending champions, Al-Ittihad, will be in the spotlight in tonight’s match. In their first match, the reigning champions, managed by Laurent Blanc, brushed aside Al-Okhdood 5-2, while Al-Fateh slumped to a surprising 1-0 home defeat to Al-Fayha. The game provides Al-Ittihad a chance to reaffirm their title contender status at home, with Al-Fateh looking to come out to play and upset.The highly anticipated matchup is scheduled for Friday, 12 September 2025, at the Al-Inma Bank Stadium in King Abdullah Sport City, Jeddah.Kick-off times:Where to watch:Al-Ittihad will come into this game in some intense attacking form. Although they showed some cracks in the defensive unit corridor against here, a 5-2 opening win, this showcased the firepower out there. The opponent was hit with a hat-trick from star striker Karim Benzema that evening, where he once again established his place as their number one source of attack. There will be plenty of goals and assists as well from winger Steven Bergwijn.Al-Fateh, in contrast, is expected to take a more patient and counter-attacking style. Combining Youssouf and Bendebka in midfield will be vital for them to keep the ball and transition into the attack. Defensive issues remain a concern, and they will face their biggest test yet as they try to handle the pressure on the road.Also Read: Will Karim Benzema play tonight against Al-Fateh? Latest update on Al-Ittihad star’s availability History strongly favors Al-Ittihad. They also benefited from their home fans as they have clinched their most recent five league clashes against Al-Fateh in Jeddah. This will leave Al-Fateh hoping to remain tactically disciplined and score from set pieces or capitalize on the few opportunities that come their way. If Al-Ittihad can keep up their attacking threat without being too careless, they are very much the favorites for all three points.Prediction: Al-Ittihad 3-1 Al-Fateh. The champions are likely to dictate possession and have a larger share of goal-scoring opportunities, though Al-Fateh could get on the score sheet via the counter or from a set piece.","Al-Ittihad host Al-Fateh in Round 2 of the 2025–26 Saudi Pro League.

How Josh Jacobs could impact Thursday Night Football in Week 2

Josh Jacobs remains one of the biggest offensive weapons for the Green Bay Packers, and fans are eager to know if he will suit up for the primetime showdown against the Washington Commanders. With Green Bay looking to build early momentum in the 2025 NFL season, Jacobs’ availability is crucial to their offensive rhythm and overall game plan at Lambeau Field tonight. The clash comes under the bright lights of Thursday Night Football in NFL Week 2, adding even more spotlight to this matchup.Yes, Josh Jacobs is expected to play against the Washington Commanders. He has not been listed with any injury designation, and his Week 1 performance showed he is in good shape to lead the Packers’ rushing attack. Fantasy projections give him a near-certain chance of being active, meaning fans can count on seeing him on the field for Thursday Night Football fantasy points and NFL rushing stats.Jacobs got off to a solid start in Week 1, but he could be in line for a much bigger performance in Week 2. Even though Thursday games often bring concern because of the short turnaround, Jacobs reportedly embraces the challenge. According to ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler, Jacobs could be “primed for a big role” on Thursday night, and he is pushing for a “rather large volume of touches.”Thursday, September 11, 20258:15 p.m. ETLambeau Field, Green Bay, WisconsinAmazon Prime VideoIn Week 2 of Thursday Night Football, the Green Bay Packers will take on the Washington Commanders at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The game kicks off at 8:15 p.m. ET, setting up an exciting primetime NFC matchup.Josh Jacobs has a quality that bettors love to see in running backs: he is Green Bay’s favorite goal-line option. In 2024, he scored 15 rushing touchdowns, many of which came in the red zone. While Jacobs isn’t known for breaking off long runs, he thrives in short-yardage situations, running with power and determination.Also Read: Miami Dolphins’ Week 1 struggles could turn real ugly with direct connection to Tyreek Hill trade talks and Mike McDaniel’s job uncertainty Washington, meanwhile, did an excellent job of stifling the New York Giants’ rushing attack in Week 1. However, the Giants’ offensive line has been a major weakness, particularly with Andrew Thomas sidelined. Green Bay, by contrast, boasts one of the strongest offensive lines in the league, giving Jacobs an advantage in the trenches. While he might not crack 100 yards on the ground this week, his chances of finding the end zone remain very high.","Green Bay Packers running back Josh Jacobs is expected to play in Thursday Night Football.

Let’s gauge through the emotions each of these women went through when they were in a relationship with the Ayahuasca Retreat lover, Aaron Rodgers.Shailene Woodley described her relationship with former Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers in an interview with Melissa Johnson ofMagazine.actress said she had lost herself completely. She said she understood what anxiety and depression truly were. Her stylist, Kris Zero, would try her level best to keep theactress occupied, but she would feel depressed again.“I haven’t shared much about my relationship with Aaron(Rodgers) because it always makes me cry. It was not right. But it was beautiful. I had a really awful, traumatic thing happen in early 2022.I felt like I lost my soul, my self, my happiness, my joy. I really understood depression and anxiety, and like, complete soul detachment.”She chose to remain in a toxic situation because she was empathizing with someone else.“Empathy kind of kept me in this loop of feeling everything for everyone. I knew I was depressed when I looked at a tree and felt nothing. That was the lowest low of my life.”Shailene Woodley’s stylist, Kris Zero, would wake her up with blasting music just to get her out of bed. “Sometimes I was so angry at her. But then we’d go surf, and for ten minutes that day, I thought life could be okay again.Then the depression would come back, and she’d out–We’re volunteering at the horse ranch! – and we’d find a random f*cking horse ranch and we’d clean up horse sh*t.We’d clean hooves and brush the horses, and for 20 minutes that day, I thought like could be okay again. And then depression came back, and she’d wake up the next morning and go–Let’s go on a hike and bring trash bags and clean up trash!”Melissa reported that after about six months, the depression started to fade.Olivia Munn, theactress, appeared on thepodcast, where she talked about a past relationship in which she felt trapped in a tumultuous family dynamic. She said that her therapist encouraged her to stay in the relationship that she wanted to get out of.“I had a therapist who I really loved, and I know that she cared about me, or at least I thought she did. I would constantly, from the very beginning, say–I don’t know about this, I don’t think this is the right(relationship), I want to get out. I gotta get out,” Munn said.Theactress said her therapist encouraged her to stay in that relationship. “She thought that my ‘picker’ was off, and she would look at it as: this person on paper looked great. And when there was couples therapy, they knew how to present the right way. Then the stories I would tell seemed unbelievable.From that experience, learning that I gotta go with my gut and I gotta be decisive with some things if it’s coming from a place where I want to survive, and I realize that I’m not happy, and that days and weeks and months go by of unhappiness and fear.I don’t know if there’s a word to describe what that relationship was like. It was without a doubt the hardest period of my life, being in that,” she said she felt “really trapped in a tumultuous family dynamic.”Munn further said that the relationship taught her to stand up for herself. “It taught me how to stand up and fight for myself, so that was great. I truly had no idea that I could be manipulated and hurt that way, that I wouldn’t just get out of something that was dangerous to my psyche.It’s not just the period that you’re with the person, but, if you’re lucky to get out, (it’s) the years of healing yourself afterwards,” Munn told Lewinsky.She further shared, “The catalyst was getting out of a relationship that had drained me and left me just really...it's hard, I don't know if there's a word to describe it what that relationship was like...it was, without a doubt, the hardest period of my life, being in that.”Danica Patrick, the former professional racing driver and model, appeared onpodcast, where she disclosed that she was in an emotionally abusive relationship with the 41-year-old quarterback, Aaron Rodgers.“The breakup with Aaron(Rodgers) in 2020—because it was sudden, it felt like it was my life. When you live with somebody, it’s your whole life—your dentist appointments, your hairdo, your clothes, your mailing address, everything. Because the nature of the relationship was emotionally abusive, it wore me down to nothing.Something that people could never imagine is that I would lack any confidence or belief in the simple things about who I am. Everything was torn to bits.He leaves a trail of blood. I don’t think I’m saying too much earth-shattering stuff; there’s been enough out there.But it gave me the greatest gift, which was myself—how much I needed to show up for myself, take care of myself,” Patrick told Sage Steele.The former IndyCar Series and NASCAR driver said she felt like she was built for hard things when she was in a relationship with Rodgers,“Hindsight, I ignored it(emotionally abusive relationship), but in real life, it was just like, I would say all the time—I’m built for hard things. I can handle hard things. And so, I just saw it as a hard thing, and my nature is to try harder and do more.What if I don't do it for the right person? What if I get too proud and go like—I'm just I'm done. Instead of going—Man, just try a little harder. What if you look back and think—Man, I wish I would have tried. I would never want that in my life. I wish I would have tried. This is probably why I don't have regret and I don't have shame.”","Aaron Rodgers’ former partners have shared powerful excerpts from their past relationships, including phrases like “Depression would come,” “Dangerous to my psyche,’ and “Emotionally abusive.” Thanks to the podcast world, women have started expressing themselves beyond the fear of judgment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123764899,imgsize-3192143,width-400,resizemode-4/nfl-aaron-rodgers.jpg"

'I think very good'



Online outrage







US President Donald Trump is facing criticism after his response to a question about the death of his ally and right-wing activist Charlie Kirk veered abruptly into a boast about White House renovations.Kirk, a 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA, was assassinated during a speech at Utah Valley University on Wednesday. He was a close supporter of Trump's political career and played a visible role in his re-election campaign.On Friday, a reporter asked Trump: “Condolences on loss of your friend Charlie. How are you holding up?”Trump responded: “I think very good. And by the way, right there you see all the trucks. They just started construction of the new ballroom for the White House, which is something they've been trying to get for about 150 years. And it's gonna be a beauty. It'll be an absolutely magnificent structure.”The clip went viral within hours, sparking a wave of criticism online.“What an utterly narcissistic man!” one user posted. “Even when asked about a close ally’s death, he couldn’t resist turning the spotlight back on himself and his imagined legacy.”Others were even more scathing. “Charlie who? Look… trucks!” one wrote. Another added: “Literally doesn’t care about him except how he can be exploited for his own gain.”A third user commented: “And just like that, Charlie Kirk’s murder is no longer useful to him — time to change the subject. What a heartless goon.”Social media users also pointed to Trump’s public appearance just hours after the assassination. “He was dancing to the YMCA at a baseball game like 6 hours after the murder of a man who was supposedly ‘like a son’ to him,” one person remarked.Comments like “Total sociopath,” “Typical narcissist,” and “What a bizarre way to respond” were among the most common reactions across platforms.","'I think very good.

Poll Who do you think will win the upcoming India-Pakistan match? India Pakistan It's too close to call

India and Pakistan have met 19 times in Asia Cup tournaments. Out of these encounters, India have claimed victory in 10 games, while Pakistan have won six. Three matches ended without a result, showing just how closely contested this rivalry has often been.The intensity of this rivalry was clear in Dubai on the eve of the latest clash. India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate , a former all-rounder from the Netherlands, faced a press room packed with questions that went far beyond combinations and tactics. Would players carry the sentiments of the public? Had India prepared differently for Pakistan? How was this match different from other India-Pakistan games?Ten Doeschate remained measured in his answers. The players were aware of public sentiment, but they would put it aside. Preparations had not changed, and there were no illusions about being favourites. What mattered, he said, was that this fixture is never just about cricket. Players, coaches, administrators and even a city like Dubai are pulled into the intensity, but whether the cricket on the field can match it remains to be seen.India enter this game as a strong side. Across formats and conditions, they have shown consistency, particularly in T20Is where they have embraced attacking batting and freedom in the middle order.Pakistan, under Mike Hesson, are working to reach that level, but the gap remains. Interestingly, two of Pakistan’s three T20I wins against India have come in Dubai.Pakistan come into the match after winning a tri-series, though they were pushed to the edge several times. Their spin-heavy attack can trouble India, but India’s batting order is in rhythm, and their spinners are looking sharp. Ten Doeschate emphasised that even small details matter, as every delivery in an India-Pakistan game begins well before it leaves the bowler’s hand.India are likely to stick with a similar combination from their opening win against UAE. Shubman Gill, who was hit in the nets, resumed training and appeared fit. Sanju Samson may continue in the middle order, providing balance and options alongside Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya and the spin trio of Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakaravarthy.Pakistan’s squad is fully available and unchanged after their opening victory. Mohammad Nawaz, who has excelled in Pakistan’s recent series wins, will be a key figure with the ball. The likes of Shaheen Afridi, Sufiyan Muqeem and Abrar Ahmed will support him, while Saim Ayub and Fakhar Zaman provide firepower at the top.Ryan ten Doeschate summed up the mood: “We’re aware of people’s feelings, at the same time we’ve got to go out, and the guys get a chance to play for their country, and they’ll be as professional and focused as they can be given the circumstance.”Pakistan star Saim Ayub added: “We are not just looking forward to the Pakistan-India match, but we are looking forward to winning the tournament.”This clash promises all the drama, pressure and spectacle of an India-Pakistan showdown. On paper, India look strong, but in this rivalry, anything can happen.","India and Pakistan have met 19 times in Asia Cup tournaments.

Why this special drill for Shubman Gill, Rinku Singh and Jitesh Sharma?

NEW DELHI: As India and Pakistan gear up for their much-anticipated Asia Cup 2025 clash in Dubai on Sunday, former India cricketer Yograj Singh has poured cold water on any expectations of a tight contest. According to him, Pakistan simply lacks the resources and mentality to match up to India on the cricket field.Speaking to ANI, Yograj was blunt in his assessment: “As far as Pakistan is concerned, what will it do? It cannot compete with India. Since the IPL came to India, Indian players have become very big. Why? To get money. There is money here. It is a good thing. There should be money. Why not? Players should get money. Where there is money, there is prosperity.”Yograj attributed India’s rise in world cricket to the platform provided by the Indian Premier League (IPL), which not only exposes players to top-class competition but also secures their financial future. He contrasted this with Pakistan’s lack of a similar structure, using a metaphor to underline the gulf: “There is no match between Pakistan and India.It is not possible. Because the platform they play on is clay. And the sky is where we play cricket. The sky and the ground have never met. It is not possible.”Pakistan, who recently won the T20I Tri-Series final against Afghanistan, continue to struggle with inconsistency in batting — a factor that has haunted them against stronger opposition. Yograj believes the team’s mindset must change if they are to progress.“I think Pakistan should develop its own team and its own people. Just like we think about our players, Pakistan should also think about them. Imran Khan brought players who were struggling with poverty and backed them to play. That is why they won the World Cup. They need a thought process like Imran Khan,” he said.","Former India cricketer Yograj Singh has poured cold water on any expectations of a tight contest with Pakistan.

He played a key role in building a pro-Trump youth movement, bringing right-wing speakers to campuses and training conservative activists. His positions aligned with much of Trump’s base: he opposed gay and transgender rights, rejected separation of church and state, backed gun rights, dismissed climate change concerns, and promoted the “great replacement” theory.In her first reaction to Charlie's assassination, Erika said that she planned to carry on his political work through the organization Turning Point USA.","""The sound of this widow weeping echoes throughout this world like a battle cry,"" she wrote in an Instagram post that included a family photo and images of her mourning.

Work history under review







Tyler Robinson, the man accused of assassinating right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, once bragged about his long-range shooting skills, according to a former coworker.The 22-year-old Robinson has been arrested without bail for allegedly killing Kirk during a speech at Utah Valley University on Wednesday. The accused previously worked as a first-year electrician on a new apartment complex in St George in 2023. A fellow electrician, who requested anonymity, told The Post on Saturday that Robinson rarely spoke on the job, unless the subject turned to firearms.“Right after Black Friday, I had just got done working and I was showing my supervisor the new pistol I bought,” the coworker said. “We were out by the trucks, and then Tyler and another guy came over and we were all talking about what kinds of guns we were gonna get or had bought, and they started talking about their longest shots. Tyler said he made a 450-yard shot.”The coworker described Robinson as distant and expressionless, but visibly more animated during that exchange. “That was like the only time we got him to conversate with us. He got excited about it — at least, as excited as he can get. He never really showed much emotion. He was just kind of, I don’t know, blank? He was just really quiet,” he told The Post.He also remembered that Robinson used to run from discussing politics.“I remember one time we were talking about [politics] in one of the units, and instead of sitting in the room with us, Tyler went into the back laundry room and sat on a bucket and I think put an earbud in,” Robinson's former coworker noted.Robinson was employed by Washington County–based High Output Electric at the time, contracted through Wilde Electric for the apartment wiring project, the coworker said.Shane Bennett, the owner of High Output Electric, confirmed Robinson worked there until late 2023 but said he could not recall whether Robinson quit or was dismissed.Robinson faces expected charges in connection with the fatal shooting of Kirk, a 31-year-old married father of two and founder of Turning Point USA. Authorities say Kirk was struck by a single bullet fired from a rooftop about 200 yards away during his address on campus.","Tyler Robinson, 22, is accused of killing right-wing activist Charlie Kirk during a speech at Utah Valley University on Wednesday.

Kathmandu: They came with portraits clutched to their chests, tears on their faces, and hearts shattered by a tragedy that both enraged and numbed a nation. On Friday, families of young protesters killed in police firing during the Gen Z protests stood united at the Reporters' Club in Kathmandu, demanding justice and recognition for their loved ones.Sumitra Mahat, elder sister of 21-year-old Umesh Mahat, a college student, told TOI her brother dreamt of becoming a football star for Nepal. ""But like many young people, he too joined the protest to fight against the unending corruption, poverty and unemployment that's eating up the country. My parents had big hopes for him, but everything lies shattered now."" Struggling to hold her tears back, Sumitra added, ""The young souls who died that day made the supreme sacrifice for Nepal's betterment. They are martyrs, and govt should recognise them as such. Their families must also be supported so they don't face further hardship after this irreparable loss.""Among the dead was 19-year-old Rasik Khatiwada, who was hit by bullets in the chest and stomach. His aunt, Sneha, holding his portrait, said, ""It is tragic young blood is spilt because of the corruption of politicians. We ask the new govt to punish those responsible, including former PM KP Sharma Oli, in the strictest possible way.Our son is a martyr. We want a country where everyone is treated equally, without bias.""Also present was Ashish Khatri, 29, who flew in from the UK to stand with the bereaved families. ""It is unfortunate that this is the price one pays for raising a democratic voice against systemic corruption,"" he said.""People were fed up with leaders filling their pockets while ignoring the country's development. Gen Z protested for the right reasons, but the govt's response turned it into an unforgettable tragedy.

English bubbly beats champagne for first time to win top award,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/english-bubbly-beats-champagne-for-first-time-to-win-top-award/articleshow/123838270.cms,"



LONDON: A prestigious award for sparkling wine has gone to an English bubbly rather than a wine from the Champagne region in France for the first time ever.Nyetimber’s £130 (Rs 15,000) Blanc de Blancs 2016 Magnum on Tuesday became the first ever non-Champagne wine to win the Champion Sparkling Wine Trophy at the International Wine Challenge (ICW) in London in the competition’s history.It was described by judges as a “racy, pithy blanc de blanc.. a time capsule of a wine with mouth-watering acidity, citrus zest and camomile, with a chalky finish”. It achieved 97 points, beating four others in the shortlist including the €260 (Rs 27,000) champagne Le Clos Lanson Blanc de Blanc 2010.Nyetimber’s head winemaker, Cherie Spriggs, also won Sparkling Winemaker of the Year for the second time, having first been awarded the trophy in 2018. At that time, she was the first person outside of Champagne to win the award and the first woman.British wine has never had more sparkle. Nyetimber is now the favourite among discerning high classes in the UK and is served at top restaurants, hotels and bars such as Annabel’s, The Goring, The Savoy and The Ivy. Nyetimber is not yet on sale in India.Spriggs and husband Brad Greatrix, who have been making English sparkling wine at Nyetimber, an historic estate, which appears in the Domesday Book, now owned by Dutchman Eric Heerema, since 2007, put its success down to the greensand and chalk soils at their 11 vineyards in West Sussex, Hampshire, and Kent. The soil is similar to that of the Champagne region thanks to the same chalk seam which runs under the English Channel.With the weather in England getting warmer owing to global warming, the South Downs has become ideal for growing the classic champagne grapes: Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Meunier.","Nyetimber’s £130 (Rs 15,000) Blanc de Blancs 2016 Magnum on Tuesday became the first ever non-Champagne wine to win the Champion Sparkling Wine Trophy at the International Wine Challenge.

Desperate fight for survival

The unlikely hero

A life-saving rescue

Lessons and reactions





What began as another ordinary evening at a cold-storage facility in central China’s Hunan province nearly turned into a tragedy when a 39-year-old woman found herself trapped inside a freezer set at minus 20°C.With no phone, no winter clothing, and no one around to hear her cries, she thought she would never make it out alive, until a delivery rider happened to pass by.The woman, surnamed Chen, was arranging goods alone on August 31 when she made a small but costly mistake. Instead of using the smaller safety door, she fully opened the freezer’s main door to move boxes. Once inside, she closed it tightly to protect the goods from moisture. When she tried to leave, the door wouldn’t open, and the backup switch had already failed.Wearing only light summer clothes, Chen felt the freezing air claw at her body. The heavily insulated 20-square-metre freezer muffled sound, making it almost impossible for her cries to reach anyone outside.“I thought of my children, one in secondary school and one only five,” Chen later said. “That was my biggest fear, that I wouldn’t see them again.”She slammed a box of frozen dumplings against the door until her arms gave out. Growing weaker, she resorted to banging her slipper against the door whenever she sensed movement. Time felt endless as her body began to shiver uncontrollably.Then came Liu Xu, a delivery rider whose job had trained him to be alert to unusual sounds. “I heard faint knocking and thought something wasn’t right,” he recalled. Following the sound, he discovered Chen locked inside. By then, she had already spent nearly 20 minutes in the freezer and was barely able to stand. It took her two hours to recover from the ordeal.Overwhelmed with gratitude, Chen later presented Liu with flowers, food, gift money, and a red pennant, a traditional symbol of appreciation in China. She even offered him a stake in her company. “I would definitely have frozen to death if no one had heard me,” she admitted.Chen has since vowed to repair the faulty freezer and reminded others about the importance of safety checks. Her story quickly went viral, sparking emotional responses online. “Not only was Chen’s life saved, her family’s happiness was too,” one commenter wrote. Another warned: “People might not be so lucky every time.”","A 39-year-old woman found herself trapped inside a freezer set at minus 20°C.

"'Horrific': Vivek Ramaswamy speaks out on beheading of Chandra Nagamallaiah in Dallas, doesn't mention he was of Indian origin",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/horrific-vivek-ramaswamy-speaks-out-on-beheading-of-indian-origin-chandra-nagamallaiah-after-backlash/articleshow/123870820.cms,"Vivek Ramaswamy condemned the brutal killing of Indian-origin Chandra Nagamallaiah in Dallas.

Why no mention of Indian origin in Vivek's condemnation







Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy finally spoke out on the gruesome killing of Indian-origin Chandra Nagamallaiah, a hotel manager in Dallas and condemned the lawlessness. ""An innocent Dallas hotel manager was brutally beheaded in front of his wife & son, by an illegal migrant who had a final order of removal & such a bad criminal history that Cuba refused to accept him. He was released on Jan 13, right before Biden left office. This is horrific. It’s time to restore the rule of law,"" Ramaswamy posted after his silence was questioned and he was trolled for not condemning the incident.""It’s unconscionable. The murderer’s violent criminal history was so bad that Cuba refused to accept him, yet he remained in the U.S. despite a final court order of removal. The fact this isn’t a bigger story shows how numb we’ve become to preventable violence. This has to end,"" Ramaswamy wrote in a follow-up post.Before Ramaswamy, Democrat leader Ro Khanna spoke out against the horrific killing and exclaimed that the killer, a known criminal, an illegal migrant whom Cuba refused to take because of his criminal history, was roaming freely on American streets. ""The brutal beheading of a hardworking Indian American immigrant in front of his wife & son is horrific. The murderer had multiple prior arrests for violent theft & child endangerment & was undocumented.He should not have been free on American streets,"" he wrote.The statements came as Indian-American politicians were slammed over their silence on the incident, even after the horrific video of how Nagamallaiah was beheaded in front of his wife and son and then his head was kicked, went viral sending a chill down the spine. Yordanis Cobos-Martinez, the killer, took a machette and chased the Indian-origin businessman, his boss, after he was upset that the boss told him to not use the broken washing machine, but did not tell him directly, asked another employee to translate it for him.The beheading took place around the same time as there has been outrage against the stabbing of Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian refugee, on a Charlotte train, and the shooting of Charles Kirk. The Indian diaspora noted how the American mainstream media played down the incident of an Indian-origin person getting brutally killed, and therefore no politicians condemned it initially.After Vivek Ramaswamy condemned the Dallas incident, social media users pointed out that he did not even mention that the victim, Nagamallaiah, was an Indian. ""Vivek You can say that the hotel manager was of Indian origin. You’re trying too hard not to show yourself as someone from Indian origin. And that should concern you,"" one wrote. ""Yes, he has tweeted. But he has not even referred to him as of Indian origin but merely a Dallas hotel manager. Looks like wants to play safe by merely tweeting this inane one,"" another wrote.","Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy finally spoke out on the gruesome killing of Indian-origin Chandra Nagamallaiah, a hotel manager in Dallas.

The Ronaldo effect

Unreal Calendar





Cristiano Ronaldo isn’t just playing football in Saudi Arabia anymore, he’s living a future he didn’t see coming. As the face of the Saudi Tourism Authority’s new global campaign,, Ronaldo now stands at the intersection of sport, culture, and national transformation. From signing a contract extension with Al Nassr to pledging to make the Kingdom his permanent home, the 40-year-old legend is not just in Saudi for goals, he’s here for good. And in doing so, he has become the living emblem of Vision 2030’s soaring ambitions.Unveiled with Cristiano Ronaldo at its center, theis more than a marketing initiative,it’s Saudi Arabia’s open invitation to the world. With the taglinethe campaign stretches across digital screens, TV spots, and global social media, targeting key markets like Europe, India, and China.The cinematic visuals show Ronaldo stepping out from monochrome shadows into vibrant color—symbolizing his journey from footballer to cultural ambassador. “What I admire most about Saudi is how it honors its roots while building for the future,” he says, anchoring the campaign’s ethos in both heritage and ambition.The calendar spans the cultural and geographic breadth of Saudi Arabia, with a year-round lineup of events in Riyadh, Jeddah, and AlUl, ranging from elite sports and global entertainment to wellness retreats, fashion showcases, and arts festivals.Saudi Arabia is no longer positioning itself as a fleeting attraction; it’s staking its claim as a permanent fixture on the global map of experience-led travel.In a heartfelt interview released via Al Nassr’s official YouTube channel, Ronaldo gave his most definitive statement yet about life after football. “My family always supports my decisions, and we’re happy here in Saudi Arabia. The people treat us in an incredibly warm way. That’s why we want to live here and build our lives here,” he said.The Portuguese icon, who turned 40 earlier this year, confirmed he intends to remain in the Kingdom long after he hangs up his boots. “I will stay two more years as a football player, but also for life because my contribution to this country is not only for football. I want to be part of the country’s growth forever.”His contract extension until 2027, announced by Al Nassr in June, sees him playing until at least age 42.
