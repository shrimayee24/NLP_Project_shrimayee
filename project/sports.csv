Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

Poll Do you think Rohit Sharma should continue playing ODIs after his T20 retirement? No, it's time to retire. Yes, he should.

India's probable Test squad for England Tour

NEW DELHI: India’s white-ball captain Rohit Sharma has finally addressed questions surrounding his future in One Day Internationals (ODIs). In a candid conversation with senior journalist Vimal Kumar, Rohit made it clear that while he’s not done just yet, he’s very aware of when to walk away.The veteran opener emphasised his evolved approach to batting, saying, ""I used to play the way I used to, I took my time. Earlier, I would play 30 balls in the first 10 overs and be at just 10 runs. But if I play 20 balls now, why can't I score 30, 35, or even 40 runs? And on the days when I get going, hitting the accelerator, scoring 80 runs in the first 10 overs isn't bad at all. That's how I think now.""READ ALSO: 'Bekaar': Rohit Sharma makes shocking statement about naturally-gifted player ""I’ve done it; I’ve scored the runs I was meant to. Now, I want to play cricket in a different way. I’m not taking any of this for granted. Don’t assume that things will just keep going the same way, that I’ll keep scoring 20 or 30 runs and just continue playing. The day I feel like I’m not able to do what I want to do on the field, I’ll stop playing. That’s for sure. But right now, I know that what I’m doing is still helping the team,"" he added.READ ALSO: Rohit Sharma hits back at criticism: 'Defending myself is waste of time' Rohit has been a key pillar in India's ODI setup, with 11,168 runs in 273 matches at an impressive average of 48.76. Under his leadership, India clinched the T20 World Cup in 2024 and the Champions Trophy earlier this year, further cementing his legacy in white-ball cricket.While he called time on his T20 career after the Barbados final, the 37-year-old recently stepped away from Test cricket after an 11-year career, having played 67 Tests and scored 4,301 runs. His highest Test score, 212, came during a memorable series against South Africa in 2019.While he’s shut the door on red-ball cricket, just like his compatriot Virat Kohli, who hung his Test boots on Monday in an unexpected retirement call, both Kohli and Rohit remain committed to ODIs, for now. Perhaps the pair is keeping an eye on the upcoming 2027 ODI World Cup.Rohit’s message is clear: he’s still hungry, still driven, but when the moment comes to step aside, he’ll do it on his own terms.","India's white-ball captain Rohit Sharma has addressed questions surrounding his future in One Day Internationals.

Taylor Swift emerges as a source of strength as Kelce contemplates life after football

The Kansas City Chiefs can rest easy for now Travis Kelce is returning for at least one more NFL season. While fans speculated about the tight end's potential retirement after multiple Super Bowl wins and a decorated career, recent reports suggest that Taylor Swift played a notable role in influencing his decision to stay on the field.According to sources close to the couple, Taylor Swift encouraged Travis Kelce to continue doing what he loves, highlighting how passionate he is about football and how much joy it brings him.Their relationship, which has been under the public eye since 2023, appears to be more than just romantic it's also a supportive partnership. Insiders say Taylor has been a strong emotional pillar for Kelce, especially as he weighs life beyond football.The full story behind Travis Kelce’s current condition remains unclear, but recent photos of him in New York have definitely stirred a flurry of reactions about his appearance. Dov Kleiman,the American sports media personality and NFL aggregator stated on X , “Yikes: Chiefs star TE Travis Kelce appears to have gained a serious amount of weight this offseason. Looks like the fame is finally getting to him…”Though the Kansas City Chiefs' star appeared fashionable and ready for a commercial shoot, many on social media pointed out that his current shape doesn’t match the usual build of an NFL athlete. Unsurprisingly, the photos sparked a wave of both praise and criticism online. In the pictures, Travis Kelce appears in a relaxed-fit sweater, paired with sunglasses and a sharply groomed haircut.Kelce’s new look has stirred a variety of responses online with some noting that his new hairstyle bore a resemblance to Swift’s ex, Joe Alwyn. One fan commented, “His hair is so confusing to me. It looks different every time we see him,” while another praised his style, saying, “Love the hair and glasses. Taylor looks beautiful as always.”Amid the buzz, some expressed discomfort with the constant media attention, with remarks like, “Leave them alone,” and “It’s actually really weird to post these photos.” Still, many supported the couple’s public appearances, with one user gushing, “They’re so cute together,” and another appreciating Travis Kelce’s behavior, saying, “This is the first guy who treats her like she deserves.”Following the tough loss in Super Bowl LIX, it appears Travis Kelce is making the most of his break. As a seasoned professional, he understands the effort required to excel on the field, and with May still underway, he has ample time to regain his top physical form.On the other hand, Kelce’s commitment to the Chiefs in 2025 is unwavering, as he aims to make the most of what could be his final season. He said, “I love so many people in Kansas City, both in that facility, in the community, and it's home for me now. I don't want to leave that life yet.”“I put in a lot of hard work, and I put in a lot of focus into being the best that I can for K.C. Last year, it didn't end well for us. I just feel like there's a responsibility in me to play out the contract that I initially signed, to give Kansas City and the Chiefs organization everything that I've got, and that's what I'm going to do, man.”Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce go dark on red carpet night, sparking breakup whispers Kelce’s determination is clear, he’s ready to give his all for Kansas City and finish strong, no matter what.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli ’s sudden retirement from Test cricket on Monday has left fans stunned. With the announcement taking the world of cricket by surprise, the internet flooded with a wave of memes, tributes, and speculation about his future in the one-day internationals (ODIs).Having already stepped away from T20 internationals following India's World Cup triumph in 2024, Kohli now remains active only in the 50-over format, prompting widespread assumptions that the 2027 ICC Cricket World Cup could be his final appearance in Indian colours.Social media platforms, especially X (formerly Twitter), exploded with reactions.Fans shared nostalgic throwbacks, emotional edits, and humorous memes, grappling with the idea of a future Indian side without Kohli.Amid the buzz, Kohli’s childhood coach Rajkumar Sharma weighed in, praising the star batter’s extraordinary Test journey and expressing hope for one last hurrah in ODIs.""I salute him for his tremendous contribution to Indian Cricket, and as a coach, I am proud of him for what he has done for the country and the example he has set for the youngsters. Emotionally, it hurts that we won't be seeing him in whites again for the country. I appreciate and back his decision...Hopefully, he will be there to win the ODI World Cup (in 2027) for India, and he will be 100 per cent committed to it,"" Sharma told ANI.Kohli’s Test career, spanning over 14 years, saw highs and lows, but his legacy is unquestionable: 9,230 runs in 123 Tests, 30 centuries, and countless iconic moments.He was instrumental in redefining India’s overseas performance and was the backbone of the side during its transition phase.Yet, his form in recent years faltered, and his final Test campaign in Australia was a shadow of his prime, despite a memorable century at Perth.As fans come to terms with the end of Kohli in whites, all eyes now turn toward his ODI future.Whether the 2027 World Cup will be his swansong remains to be seen. But for now, the internet’s love for Kohli is louder than ever, even if it’s through memes.","Virat Kohli's sudden retirement from Test cricket has left fans stunned.

India's probable Test squad for England Tour

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli ’s unexpected decision to retire from Test cricket has left the cricketing world stunned, and his former Delhi and Ranji coach Sarandeep Singh is no exception.In a surprising revelation, the ex-India spinner claimed that Kohli had shown no signs of stepping away from the red-ball format and was actively preparing for India’s upcoming tour of England.“Not at all,” Sarandeep said when asked if Kohli hinted at retiring. “He came to play red-ball cricket (in Ranji Trophy), so he had no thinking like that. Even at that time, he was talking about the England series with the test matches that are coming. So, he was going to play there.""And this time, he would be very much prepared. He said he was going to score maximum hundreds, which he did the last time in 2018 when he went to England. He scored a lot of runs over there. There was nothing like that when he came to play Ranji Trophy matches.""We thought that we would see him on the England tour. He is one of the most senior players. Especially, the England tour is very tough. So, without him, I don't know how the Indian team will manage now.”Kohli had rejoined Delhi’s Ranji squad earlier this year for the game against Railways, signalling his intent to get more game time ahead of the tough overseas series.According to Sarandeep, the 36-year-old was eager to score big in England once more, reminiscent of his brilliant 593-run haul during the 2018 tour.Kohli’s retirement came ahead of the crucial five-match Test series against England, which also serves as the opening leg of India’s World Test Championship 2025–27 cycle.With 123 Tests, 9,230 runs, and a captaincy record of 40 wins in 68 matches, Kohli leaves behind an extraordinary legacy.His final series, the 2024–25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, was a mixed bag. Despite a century in the opening Test at Perth, his overall returns were modest, and his vulnerability against the moving ball showed.Still, many believed he had one final chapter left in England. His sudden exit has left a void, not just in the Indian line-up, but also among fans who hoped to see their champion sign off on his own terms.","Former Delhi and Ranji coach Sarandeep Singh says Virat Kohli had shown no signs of stepping away from the red-ball format.

A sixth-round surprise puts pressure on Dolphins’ backfield

Mystery lingers over Blake Ferguson’s hidden injury saga

Tua Tagovailoa’s fragility narrative resurfaces despite comparable game time

The Miami Dolphins are heading into the 2025 NFL season surrounded by uncertainty, fueled by unexpected rookie performances and renewed concern over quarterback Tua Tagovailoa ’s long-term durability. As training camp looms, whispers inside the locker room hint at deeper issues simmering beneath the surface, from injury secrets to financial maneuvering.While all eyes were on Miami’s top draft picks, sixth-round selection Ollie Gordon II is turning heads before even taking a snap. The former Doak Walker Award winner from Oklahoma State is no ordinary late-round flyer. Scouts had pegged him as a mid-round steal, and early signs point to him potentially disrupting Miami’s depth chart much sooner than expected. His collegiate résumé suggests he’s more than capable of becoming a feature back, especially if he maintains his explosive playmaking ability.Adding intrigue to the Dolphins’ offseason is the case of long snapper Blake Ferguson, who landed on the Non-Football Injury list last October without public explanation. Known for consistency and professionalism, Ferguson’s absence remains cloaked in mystery. No detailed reports, no official updates—only silence. This has sparked speculation from fans and insiders alike, highlighting the lack of transparency that often surrounds NFL injury management.Tua Tagovailoa continues to be a lightning rod for debate. Though he has logged nearly as many games as Cincinnati Bengals star Joe Burrow, Tua’s injury history—particularly his concussions—has unfairly earned him the ""fragile"" label. Critics ignore the reality that football’s violence spares no one, and durability is often a matter of circumstance more than toughness. The discourse not only affects Tua’s public perception but could influence how the front office views his future in Miami.Beyond health and performance, financial strategy looms large. The Dolphins must weigh future contracts for key players like linebacker Jordyn Brooks and defensive end Jaelan Phillips, both entering critical phases in their careers. These decisions aren’t just about cap space—they impact team chemistry and the franchise’s trajectory.Also Read: Tyreek Hill’s trash talk fuels tension with iShowSpeed and Noah Lyles medalist as fans await the ultimate race The 2025 Dolphins are a team teetering between breakthrough and breakdown.

The Oilers cannot let him play again. Under any circumstance.”A fan reacted to it, saying, “I said this before the playoffs started. I don’t know how they win the series with pickard and then put this pylon in.. what the actual f*ck”On May 12, the Edmonton Oilers released their Game 4 day schedule on X, and fans could not stop discussing their goaltenders, Stuart Skinner and Calvin Pickard. In particular, Stuart Skinner’s presence and Calvin Pickard’s absence. Fans expressed volumes of frustration.“Playing with an empty net for the whole game would cause less anxiety than having Shit Skinner in there.”“No Pickard again I cri”“Skinner in net? Yeah I’m not watching thx”“I’m scared for this game. ��”“So no pickard for the rest of the series?”“If skinners in net I’m not watching guys f**king garbage”“Pencil in another loss. Skinner is tending again”","Edmonton Oilers lost Game 3 of Round 2 against the Vegas Golden Knights and posted on their X, “Game 4 goes Monday ��” A fan commented, ‘Pickard 6-0 Skinner 0-3’ - meaning, Calvin Pickard has had 6 wins in 7 NHL postseason games while Stuart Skinner has had 0 wins in 3 NHL postseasongames.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121119142,imgsize-651894,width-400,resizemode-4/NHL-STU-2025.jpg"

Unmukt Chand Exclusive: Why he moved to the USA, playing in T20 leagues and ambitions

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli ’s wife and acclaimed actress Anushka Sharma shared a deeply emotional message on social media following Kohli’s announcement of retirement from Test cricket on Monday. Kohli brought the curtains down on an illustrious 14-year-long red-ball career, having featured in 123 Tests since making his debut against West Indies in 2011. Following Sachin Tendulkar’s retirement in 2013, Kohli emerged as India’s batting mainstay in the longest format.“They’ll talk about the records and the milestones — but I’ll remember the tears you never showed, the battles no one saw, and the unwavering love you gave this format of the game. I know how much all this took from you,” Anushka wrote on Instagram, sharing a heartfelt photo with her husband.“After every Test series, you came back a little wiser, a little humbler — and watching you evolve through it all has been a privilege,” she added.“Somehow, I always imagined you’d retire international cricket in whites — But you’ve always followed your heart, and so I just want to say my love, you’ve earned every bit of this goodbye,” she wrote in her tribute.Kohli’s decision to retire came just days after Rohit Sharma also stepped away from Test cricket, leaving India without two of its most senior batters ahead of the upcoming tour of England. The five-Test series begins on June 20, and India will now need to appoint a new captain and rework its batting core.Reflecting on his journey, Kohli shared his own thoughts in an Instagram post. “As I step away from this format, it’s not easy — but it feels right,” he wrote. “It’s been 14 years since I first wore the baggy blue in Test cricket. Honestly, I never imagined the journey this format would take me on. It’s tested me, shaped me, and taught me lessons I’ll carry for life.”Over his career, the 36-year-old scored 9,230 runs, including 30 centuries and 31 fifties, at an average of 46.85. As captain, he led India in 68 Tests, securing 40 wins — the most by any Indian Test skipper.Kohli often spoke about his love for the format and the mental and emotional challenges it presented. He once described his fondness for the grind of Test cricket, saying it included “the quiet grind, the long days, the small moments that no one sees but that stay with you forever.”“I am walking away with a heart full of gratitude — for the game, for the people I shared the field with, and for every single person who made me feel seen along the way,” he wrote in his farewell message. “I will always look back at my Test career with a smile. #269, signing off.”In terms of records, Kohli ended his career as India’s fourth-highest run-scorer in Tests behind Sachin Tendulkar (15,921), Rahul Dravid (13,265), and Sunil Gavaskar (10,122). He holds the record for the most double hundreds by an Indian in Tests — seven — one more than Tendulkar.Kohli’s legacy as captain is equally significant. His 40 Test wins surpass the tallies of MS Dhoni (27 from 60 Tests) and Sourav Ganguly (21 from 49 Tests). Globally, he ranks fourth among captains with the most Test wins, behind Graeme Smith (53), Ricky Ponting (48), and Steve Waugh (41).Under Kohli’s leadership, India rose to the No. 1 ranking in Test cricket after he succeeded MS Dhoni in 2014-15. The team held on to that position for nearly five years. His crowning achievement came in 2018 when he led India to a historic first-ever Test series win on Australian soil.","Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14-year career.

Kohli, who debuted in 2011, played 123 Test matches, scoring 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85. His retirement post on Instagram came five days after India captain Rohit Sharma also stepped away from the longest format.""Anything I write for you, paji, will never truly capture what I feel or the impact you’ve had on me,"" Gill wrote on his social media handle.""From watching you bat when I was 13 and wondering how someone could bring that kind of energy to the field – to sharing the field with you and realizing no one else possibly can – you’ve not just inspired a generation, you’ve reshaped the mindset of millions.

He stepped down from the captaincy in 2022. The only captains close to his record are MS Dhoni (27 wins in 60 Tests) and Sourav Ganguly (21 in 49).""I'm walking away with a heart full of gratitude – for the game, for the people I shared the field with, and for every single person who made me feel seen along the way,"" Kohli wrote.""I'll always look back at my Test career with a smile.""While Kohli’s fierce competitiveness remained unchanged, a dip in form over the past two years – averaging 32.56 – may have contributed to his decision to step away.

Tom Brady, Shedeur Sanders, and a draft snub that raised questions



""I Texted Shedeur.."" - Tom Brady SPEAKS OUT on Shedeur Sanders Plummeting In NFL Draft

The unanswered questions around Brady and Sanders



In a world where NFL loyalties can blur under business interests, the curious case of Tom Brady and Shedeur Sanders is raising eyebrows across the league. The former Colorado star's unexpected slide to the fifth round in the 2025 NFL Draft shocked many but what came next was even more perplexing. Despite Brady’s long-standing relationship with Sanders and his minority stake in the quarterback-needy Las Vegas Raiders , the team passed on the young signal-caller not once, but repeatedly. Why?Brady, the most decorated quarterback in NFL history, knows a thing or two about draft-day heartbreak. Pick No. 199 in 2000, his rise from overlooked backup to GOAT is legendary. So when he reached out to Shedeur Sanders after his draft fall, it felt like a passing of the torch. “Use it as motivation,” Brady told him, a mentor’s words to a young talent who had just been humbled by the system. But here’s where it gets messy.Despite having direct ties to the Raiders, Brady insists he had no input in the team's draft process. That’s hard to believe. The Raiders, still lacking a solid long-term QB plan, ignored a player with NFL bloodlines, proven college leadership, and Brady’s stamp of approval. Did business acumen outweigh personal connection? Or worse was Brady’s influence downplayed to dodge accountability?Critics aren’t buying the clean-hands narrative. Brady’s role as a minority owner might not give him final say, but to suggest he was totally removed from evaluation discussions feels disingenuous. Especially when Sanders, someone Brady reportedly mentored for years, ended up with the Browns, a team not even rumored to be in the QB hunt early on.Shedeur, to his credit, has taken the high road. He’s echoed Brady’s own draft-day mantra: tunnel vision forward. Still, NFL insiders continue to speculate: Did Brady quietly influence the Raiders’ decision? Or was this just another example of the league’s cutthroat nature, where friendships crumble under corporate strategy?Also Read: Pittsburgh Steelers' QB dilemma: Could Carson Wentz be the surprising fix they need? This isn’t the last chapter in the Sanders-Brady-Raiders triangle. With Shedeur now in Cleveland and looking to prove the league wrong, every snap he takes will be watched closely and not just by fans, but by those who let him fall. Did Brady do right by Sanders or did business speak louder than brotherhood?","The curious case of Tom Brady and Shedeur Sanders is raising eyebrows across the league.

Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) Lt. General Rajiv Ghai, during a press briefing on Monday, named Virat Kohli as his favourite cricketer, following the star batter’s retirement from Test cricket. Ghai also drew a fascinating parallel between cricket and national defence while explaining India’s multi-layered air-defence system.Kohli, who ended a glittering 14-year Test career, amassed 9,230 runs in 123 matches at an average of 46.85.Addressing the current situation along the India-Pakistan border, Lt. General Ghai—joined by Director General Air Operations Air Marshal AK Bharti and Director General of Naval Operations Vice Admiral AN Pramod—highlighted the robustness of India’s air-defence system using a cricket analogy from the legendary 1974-75 Ashes series.Drawing from the fierce rivalry between England and Australia, he recalled how the Australian pace duo of Jeff Thomson and Dennis Lillee wreaked havoc on England’s batting line-up, taking a combined 58 wickets to help Australia win the series 4-1.“Aaj shayad cricket ki baat bhi karni chahiye, kyuki mai dekh raha tha Virat Kohli ne Test cricket se retirement leli. Kayi bharatiyo ki tarah mere bhi favourite cricketer hain (Maybe today I should talk about cricket too, because I saw that Virat Kohli has retired from Test cricket. Like many Indians, he is my favourite cricketer as well.),” said Lt. General Ghai.He continued, “In 1970's Australia and England were squaring off in the Ashes series. The Aussies had two fast bowlers Jeff Thomson and Dennis Lillee who completely destroyed the English batting line up. At that time, Australia coined a phrase — 'ashes to ashes, dust to dust, if Thommo don't get ya, Lillee surely must.’”Using this analogy to underline the effectiveness of India’s defence strategy, Ghai explained how multiple layers of the country’s air-defence grid work in tandem to neutralize aerial threats.“If you see the layers, you'll understand what I am trying to say. Even if you crossed all the layers, one of the layers of this grid system will hit you,” he added.",Lt. General Rajiv Ghai named Virat Kohli as his favourite cricketer.

James, a four-time NBA champion, could provide Golden State with much-needed frontcourt size and experience.Kirschenbaum noted: ""(LeBron) James has long been linked to Golden State, in part because his rivalry against Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Draymond Green (they've played each other in five playoff series, during which James has gone 2-3) eventually blossomed into a bromance.""However, age and injury concerns loom large. A potential lineup featuring James (39), Curry (37), Jimmy Butler (35), and Draymond Green (34) would raise questions about durability.According to Caleb Hightower of the Sporting News 1.

While his arrival would electrify the Bay Area, logistical and financial challenges make this move far from guaranteed.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to sign $197,230,450 Memphis Grizzlies star to bolster squad around LeBron James and Luka Doncic For now, fans can only speculate—but the idea of LeBron in a Warriors jersey remains a fascinating possibility.","The Golden State Warriors face an uncertain future after a challenging playoff run.

Carmelo Anthony delivered a message filled with wisdom during his Syracuse graduation speech



When Carmelo Anthony stepped onto the stage at the JMA Wireless Dome on Sunday, the former NBA star wasn't just addressing a sea of caps and gowns. He was standing in the very arena that helped shape his own legend, delivering a heartfelt commencement speech that was part inspiration, part reflection, and unmistakably, a powerful message to his son, Kiyan .NBA legend Carmelo Anthony delivered a heartfelt message at Syracuse. In his speech, Anthony recalled his own journey in basketball and a few thought-provoking and awe-inspiring words.“Wow, what a moment, what a full circle moment I would say,” Anthony began, speaking to thousands of graduates and their families. He wasn’t in a jersey this time but behind a podium, marking 22 years since he helped Syracuse win its only NCAA men’s basketball title in 2003.The 10-time NBA All-Star used the platform to reflect on his journey from Baltimore’s gritty streets to the NBA’s biggest stages. Yet, the core of his message was about evolution as a person. He reminded the class of 2025 that titles and trophies don’t define you; growth and authenticity do.“You don’t have to fit in a box. You can have multiple careers. You can evolve repeatedly if you keep chasing what sets your soul on fire,” he declared, a line that drew applause from the crowd and resonated far beyond the court.Melo’s advice was for his son, Kiyan, who will be starting his own chapter at Syracuse in the fall. A four-star recruit and the top player in New York, Kiyan carries the weight of a legendary last name. But for Carmelo, his son’s path is about much more than following in his footsteps.“Watching him walk the same halls, wear the same colors… is one of the proudest moments of my life,” Carmelo said, voice thick with emotion. “It's not just about following in my footsteps. It's about watching him create his own story. That's the power of family. That's the power of legacy.”“When I left for the NBA, I thought basketball would be my whole story. But life had other plans,” he shared. “I was more than just an athlete. And so are you, more than just your major.”He urged graduates to give back to the communities that raised them, to stand for something even when no one is watching. “Carry the orange with you… Be bold. Be kind. Be relentless. Live with purpose. Give back. Honor your roots. Chase your dreams, and don’t be afraid to rewrite the script as you go.”Also Read: “We're sick of it” — ESPN analyst erupts over Draymond Green’s ‘angry black man’ outburst Such an inspiring message from the NBA legend will certainly resonate with the students who are graduating from the institute.","NBA legend Carmelo Anthony delivered a heartfelt message at Syracuse.

'Virat wants to play the Olympics'

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years. Where do India go from here?

Poll What aspect of Virat Kohli's career do you admire the most? His sportsmanship Consistency in performance Leadership qualities His batting skills

NEW DELHI: A young Virat Kohli , just 12 years old, riding on the back of his father Prem Nath Kohli's scooter with his kit bag perched on the front, is an image that former India cricketer Atul Wassan will always remember. Wassan, who had represented India in four Tests and nine ODIs, was at his friend Rajkumar Sharma's academy in Paschim Vihar, Delhi. It was a Sunday morning, years ago, when a chubby-cheeked Virat arrived with his father and brother, Vikas.Like every other student, Virat and his brother were asked to pad up and face a few deliveries. One shot, then another, and another. After about ten shots, Wassan and Rajkumar exchanged a glance and jokingly said, “Virat Kohli ko chhod do, dusre bhai ko padha likha lo [Leave Virat here, focus on educating the other brother].""Little did they know that moment marked the beginning of Virat's journey to greatness, and Wassan would soon take the reins to nurture this talented young cricketer.Eight years after their first meeting, Wassan chose Virat to represent Delhi in a Ranji Trophy match against Tamil Nadu at home in 2006. And over time, that 12-year-old kid evolved into a legend of the game.“I do remember him clearly. He came to our academy with Rajkumar and me when he was just 12 years old. I still recall that moment. Even back then, he had something special. However, we never imagined he’d reach such incredible heights. No one could predict it,"" Wassan told TimesofIndia.com.""I remember the first time I toured with Sachin Tendulkar; he was 16. Virat was also special, but even with talent, no one can guarantee success. Many factors have to fall into place. The genius lies in maintaining focus and consistently taking the next step. Just having talent isn’t enough. Many have talent, but to sustain it, to evolve, and to remain grounded amid commercialisation, while excelling in all formats, with different pressures — it's rare. When everything falls into place, you get talents like Tendulkar and Virat,” he said.“Rajkumar first spotted this boy. He insisted and said ‘no, you must come and see this kid.’ So, I agreed. When I saw him, I knew there was something special about him. It’s hard to explain, but you can just tell when someone has the ‘X-factor.’ His brother and father came too. He said, ‘Just wait for a minute,’ and that’s when we knew he had potential,” Wassan said.After India clinched the T20 World Cup 2024 title, Virat announced his retirement almost immediately. However, his decision to retire from Test cricket left fans heartbroken, particularly as he was expected to play in England.""I’m walking away with a heart full of gratitude — for the game, for the people I shared the field with, and for every single person who made me feel seen along the way,"" Virat wrote on Instagram.Yes, the Baggy Blue #269 will no longer grace the field.Virat concluded his Test career with 9,230 runs in 123 matches, including 30 centuries and 31 fifties. He finished as the fourth-highest run-scorer for India, behind Sachin Tendulkar , Rahul Dravid, and Sunil Gavaskar.""He’s played and conquered the game, and now he’s enjoying his IPL career, staying supremely fit. Test cricket, though, demands a lot mentally and physically, and not everyone has the mindset to endure that. Virat understands that. He wants to enjoy life and has nothing more to prove. He’ll keep playing IPL and maybe even aim for the Olympics. He wants to play the Olympics. Ultimately, a player knows himself better than anyone else,"" Wassan said.“People keep talking about the 700-800 runs he needs for 10,000 runs, but that number doesn’t define Virat. Even if he never gets there, his impact on the game is undeniable. Players like (Matthew) Hayden and (Adam) Gilchrist changed the way cricket is played, and Virat has done the same in his own way. Now, with a family of two kids, I think he’s realised he’s achieved everything,"" the former cricketer said.What started as the era of ""Sachin! Sachin!"" eventually transformed into the ""Virat! Virat!"" era.","Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years. He finished as the fourth- highest run-scorer for India, behind Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, and Sunil Gavaskar.

LeBron James sends prayers for Jayson Tatum’s recent injury



Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James has recently reacted to the devastating Jayson Tatum injury. A cloud of uncertainty hangs over Boston after star forward Tatum suffered what appeared to be a serious lower-leg injury in the closing minutes of Game 4 against the New York Knicks . The Celtics dropped the game 121-113 at Madison Square Garden, but with that loss, they may have also lost their franchise cornerstone, just as the team faces elimination in the Eastern Conference Semifinals .Jayson Tatum’s non-contact injury occurred during a fast-paced scramble for a loose ball late in the fourth quarter. Tatum suddenly collapsed, clutching his right ankle in visible agony. He remained on the floor as Celtics trainers rushed over, and moments later, he was taken to the locker room in a wheelchair, unable to put any weight on his leg.While the full extent of the injury remains unclear, Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla confirmed that Tatum would undergo an MRI on Tuesday. His status for Game 5 is uncertain, and his absence could be the final blow to Boston’s fading postseason hopes, with the team now trailing the Knicks 3-1 in the series.LeBron James was among the first to send well wishes. Taking to X, he posted simply: ""Big Deuce,"" a heartfelt nod to Tatum’s nickname. The two have gone head-to-head in some memorable playoff battles, and James’ message shows the mutual respect between NBA stars, even across team lines.Tatum’s teammates were shaken following the game. Al Horford , a veteran presence in Boston’s locker room, expressed concern beyond the scoreboard: “The loss is the loss. More importantly it’s just Tatum that I’m worried about… Just making sure I’m here for him. That’s my priority.”Jaylen Brown, often Tatum’s co-leader on the court, struggled to put his emotions into words. “It’s tough. Not really a lot to say,” he said.Players across the league joined in to show support. Knicks star Jalen Brunson, despite celebrating a huge win for his own team, began his postgame remarks with a genuine message: “Prayers out to JT, man. I just wanted to say that, first and foremost.” His teammates echoed the sentiment.Minnesota Timberwolves’ big man Karl-Anthony Towns, who witnessed the moment courtside, offered an emotional reflection, “I just walked up, obviously respectful of his space. I just put my head down and prayed to my mother, prayed to God to put protection over him and comfort, whatever the injury may be. I hope it’s minor.”Also Read: Jayson Tatum sustains non contact injury during Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks Game 4 As the Celtics prepare for a do-or-die Game 5 on Wednesday, the basketball world will keep a close eye on Tatum’s diagnosis.",LeBron James sends prayers for Jayson Tatum’s recent injury.

Philadelphia, led by Jalen Hurts and bolstered by Saquon Barkley, aims to showcase their dominance. Dallas, under new coach Brian Schottenheimer, seeks to overcome challenges and prove their mettle against a strong Eagles team.

Jalen Hurts leads Eagles into new season as Cowboys start fresh

The 2025 NFL season is set to open with a thrilling spectacle on Thursday, September 4, as the Philadelphia Eagles square off against the Dallas Cowboys at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. The contest promises to deliver fireworks right from the start, as both teams bring contrasting storylines into the season opener.For the Philadelphia Eagles, this game marks more than just a season opener it’s a celebration of their Super Bowl victory. Coming off a dominant win over the Kansas City Chiefs, the Eagles will raise their championship banner before taking the field.With Jalen Hurts returning as one of the league’s top quarterbacks, the Eagles' offense remains a force to be reckoned with. The addition of Saquon Barkley to the backfield only enhances a unit already packed with talent, including top receivers A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith.On the defensive side, Philadelphia boasts one of the most intimidating units in the NFL, with a pass rush that could put immense pressure on Dak Prescott and the Cowboys' offensive line.In contrast, the Dallas Cowboys come into this game with significant questions hanging over their heads. After a disappointing 7-10 finish in 2024, the Cowboys made a major change in their coaching staff, replacing Mike McCarthy with Brian Schottenheimer.This marks Schottenheimer’s first season as head coach, and he faces an uphill battle to immediately gel with a team that’s still searching for consistency. Quarterback Dak Prescott will be under the microscope, as he looks to rebound from an injury-filled 2024.The Cowboys' offensive line also faces challenges, especially with the retirement of Zack Martin, making them vulnerable against the Eagles’ strong defensive front.The Cowboys’ defense, led by Micah Parsons, remains one of the team’s strongest assets. However, injuries to key players like Trevon Diggs have left the secondary thinner than usual, potentially allowing the Eagles to exploit mismatches in the passing game.If the Cowboys are to pull off an upset, they’ll need their defense to perform at its best while also finding ways to protect Prescott and establish a balanced offensive attack.Also read: NFL eyes historic digital first as Chiefs vs Chargers Brazil Opener nears YouTube TV streaming breakthrough With the Eagles’ potent offense and dominant defense on full display, the Cowboys face a tough road ahead, relying on new leadership and key players to step up.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s low profile sparks mixed reactions from fans and media

Magazine cover ignites fan backlash over media scrutiny

Calls for privacy highlight celebrity culture fatigue

Once hailed as the ultimate celebrity power couple , Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have suddenly gone quiet, fueling speculation and fan fatigue. With no recent public appearances, many are now questioning if their high-profile romance was ever more than media hype.Ever since the whirlwind romance between Taylor Swift and NFL star Travis Kelce began making headlines, the couple's public appearances became a hot topic across entertainment and sports media. From Kelce attending Swift’s “Eras Tour” shows to Swift passionately cheering him on during the NFL season, their relationship captured public fascination throughout 2023 and early 2024.But after Swift wrapped up her international tour in December 2024 and Kelce’s Kansas City Chiefs fell short at the Super Bowl in February, the high-profile pair has noticeably stepped back from the spotlight.Their recent absence from major public events—most notably the Met Gala in May 2025—sparked fresh conversations. Although both were invited, they reportedly skipped the prestigious fashion event due to scheduling conflicts. The last time Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce were seen publicly was back in March, dining together at Del Frisco’s Grille in New York City, according to The US Sun.A recent magazine cover questioning Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s absence drew backlash online, with fans taking to Reddit to voice their annoyance over the tabloid’s narrative. One user shared an image of the cover, captioning it: “It’s not that serious… Genuinely, why are people making their 'disappearance' such a big deal?”Others chimed in with sharp criticism of the media's obsession. “Did they disappear? Or did she just stop getting shoved down everyone’s throats when the tour ended?” one commenter asked. Another added, “I think it’s both. I think Taylor’s PR really overestimated how the ‘NFL princess’ thing was going to land. I think she really got her feelings hurt at the Super Bowl… that’s what caused the NFL’s stark pivot away from her and her ‘hiatus.’”The online discussion also sparked broader commentary about celebrity culture. One user noted, “God forbid if celebrities not be in everything all the time. Football season is over. Her tour is over. That’s it.” Another quipped, “I could never be that obsessed with a celebrity let alone their relationship. It’s very ick. Like stalker to the point of needing arrested.”Ultimately, while the media speculates on the reasons behind the couple's low profile, a large portion of fans appear to be echoing a common sentiment: let them live their lives in peace. As one Reddit user aptly put it, “Even her fans aren’t asking where she is. No one cares.”Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce desperately tried to stay out of Hollywood sex scandal — but now they may have no choice","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce were once hailed as the ultimate celebrity power couple.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Earthquake of 5.7 magnitude hits Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/earthquake-of-5-7-magnitude-hits-pakistan/articleshow/121050126.cms,"Representative photo





A 5.7-magnitude earthquake struck Pakistan on Saturday morning, Reuters reported. The tremor occurred just hours after a 4.0-magnitude quake had hit the region.Shallow earthquakes tend to be more dangerous than deeper ones because their seismic waves have a shorter distance to travel to the Earth's surface. This results in stronger ground shaking, increasing the potential for structural damage and higher casualties.Pakistan is among the most seismically active countries in the world due to its position along the boundary between the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. The ongoing collision between these plates generates frequent and often destructive seismic activity.Several major fault lines run through the country, further heightening its vulnerability.

What’s the tile game Meghan Markle played on Netflix? A beginner’s guide to mahjong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/whats-the-tile-game-meghan-markle-played-on-netflix-a-beginners-guide-to-mahjong/articleshow/120736644.cms,"Meghan Markle played the game of Mahjong in her Netflix series

From the Qing dynasty to pop culture

How is mahjong played?

Connor Wan, a 29-year-old British-Chinese artist, learned mahjong while visiting family in Hong Kong. He enjoyed it so much that he started the Four Winds Mahjong Club in London, and later brought it to Toronto after moving there in 2024. “Moving countries is hard, especially when you don’t know anyone,” he said. The club became popular quickly, not as a place for gambling, but for making friends and celebrating Asian culture. Nicole Wong, a writer and audio producer from California, started playing mahjong as a teenager with her grandparents. She later began The Mahjong Project in 2019 to share the game’s cultural stories and organise pop-up game nights. This year, she published a book called Mahjong: House Rules from Across the Asian Diaspora. Nicole says the sound of the tiles is especially powerful. “Mahjong is more than just fun,” she says. “It has a deep history and brings back strong memories.” In Toronto, Robyn Feldberg has taught over 250 people how to play mahjong through her courses. She donates all the money—about $50,000 so far—to charities like Save A Child’s Heart. She says the game is especially popular with young mothers who want a fun way to relax and connect with others. “They tell me, ‘We want something that’s just for us,’” she said.

A centuries-old Chinese game called mahjong is having a modern revival across continents, from luxury cruise ships and trendy hotel lounges to Meghan Markle’s Netflix series.In the sixth episode of her docuseries With Love, the Duchess of Sussex invites friends for a cosy game night – playing mahjong, reports the Globe and Mail.The four-person tile-based game, traditionally associated with Chinese culture, is now catching on with new generations across the globe. “The game itself is really so fun,” says Markle. “But what was so great was the idea of learning something new with your friends, together... the mahjong becomes the background of the expansion of friendship. It’s the feeling of community.”Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China. Traditionally played with 144 tiles, the game blends skill, strategy and a touch of luck. Players pick and discard tiles to form winning hands, much like the card game rummy.The game’s expansion across the world has now erupted into a full-blown trend. The World Mahjong Championship was recently held in Mississauga, Ontario – the first time it’s been hosted in North America. Hotels such as the Ace Hotel New York and Thompson Hotel Dallas regularly hold mahjong-themed nights.Fans with money to spare are buying fancy mahjong sets from Hermès, Louis Vuitton, and Ralph Lauren. Some are even splashing out on luxury tables that shuffle the tiles automatically – costing over $4,500.Even cruise ships have joined the trend, offering mahjong tournaments and special rooms just for playing the game.Mahjong is played with 144 tiles. Players begin by shuffling the tiles face down. Everyone rolls dice and the highest roller becomes the dealer. Each player picks 36 tiles and builds a wall—two rows of 18 tiles. The walls are pushed forward, creating a space in the middle for discards. Each player then draws 13 tiles (the dealer starts with 14), and the game begins.Players take turns drawing one tile and discarding one, always keeping 13 tiles in hand. You can draw a new tile or pick up someone’s discarded one. If a discarded tile helps complete a set (called a meld), you can grab it, announce the set, and show the tiles. To win, a player must have four melds (like three or four matching tiles or a sequence of three in a suit) and one pair (two matching tiles)—making 14 tiles total.There are five types of tiles: Bamboo, Characters, Dots (these are the three main suits), and special tiles called Honors (Dragons and Winds) and Bonus (Flowers and Seasons). Each suit goes from 1 to 9. Honors and Bonus tiles add extra excitement but aren't needed to win. Mahjong mixes strategy and memory with a bit of luck—and it’s all about building the right sets before your opponents do.For many mahjong fans, it’s not just a game but a deeply social experience.","Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China.

UK Magic Circle to honour woman thrown out for 'masqueradeing' as man,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-magic-circle-to-honour-woman-thrown-out-for-masqueradeing-as-man/articleshow/120584411.cms,"Representative Image (AI)

LONDON: Over 30 years after Britain's elite Magic Circle expelled a woman for posing as a man to gain admittance, the formerly male-only society is to welcome her back as a full member.The London-based international magic organisation ejected Sophie Lloyd after she masqueraded as a male in 1991 to win membership.But after her story came to light last year, the society's first female chair Laura London launched a search to track down Lloyd and apologise.She was eventually located living abroad and will later on Thursday be presented with a membership certificate at a special ceremony at the organisation's London headquarters.""It is so exciting after all these months tracking Sophie... I can't tell you how happy we are as a society to welcome her back into the fold,"" London told BBC radio.Lloyd posed as Raymond Lloyd for 18 months before unmasking herself as a woman.But members, who voted to admit women in September 1991, were so angered by her ""deliberate deception"" that they went ahead with her expulsion.The deception was in fact a two-person act involving the late magician Jenny Winstanley, who recruited Lloyd to help her prove that women magicians were just as good as men.""I did a 20-minute show in front of 200 people, three examiners, and spoke to the examiner for an hour-and-three-quarters afterwards,"" Lloyd said, recalling how she managed to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.After the Magic Circle changed its stance on allowing women in, Winstanley, who died in 2004, phoned the society to explain.""Two days later we got a letter to say Raymond's been expelled,"" said Lloyd.""We couldn't get our heads round it. We just thought, 'come on it's funny, it's amusing' but they didn't think so and Jenny was completely snubbed, unfortunately.""After the expulsion, Lloyd continued to perform magic for 11 years in an anti-bullying variety show before eventually moving overseas.She said the Magic Circle had changed out of all recognition in the 30 years since she was thrown out, adding: ""This is for Jenny really, Jenny would have loved it.""London said Thursday's ceremony would also be a chance to recognise Winstanley both for her contribution to magic and her audacious trick at the Magic Circle's expense.""I just think she's a wonderful woman and I know she'd have loved to be here and I just wish more than anything I could have met her myself,"" she said.The Magic Circle was founded in 1905 by around 20 magicians at a restaurant in London's Chinatown district.Members must vow never to give away the secrets of magic.Although women have now been admitted to the Magic Circle for over 30 years, they still make up only around five percent of the society's 1,700 membership.The body says, however, that increasing numbers are now coming through in the 10-18-year-old age group.","Sophie Lloyd was expelled from the Magic Circle after posing as a man to gain admittance.

Virat Kohli drops retirement bombshell | Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket

When we talk about Virat Kohli , Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and dressing room stories, one name that immediately comes to mind is AB de Villiers , given the kind of bond they have shared over the years. But last week, everyone was in for a pleasant surprise when Virat Kohli credited former South African wicketkeeper-batter Mark Boucher for guiding him during the early years of his international and Indian Premier League (IPL) career. ""Actually, of all the players I played with initially, Mark Boucher had the biggest impact on me,"" Kohli told the ‘RCB Bold Diaries’ podcast. The duo spent three years at RCB.In 2008, Mark Boucher saw Kohli’s potential and told him he would be doing a disservice to himself if he failed to make it to the senior Indian team. He took a young 20-year-old under his wings, helped him practice during net sessions and become battle-ready for the bouncy tracks in South Africa and Australia.""I just tried to help him in his development at that particular stage. He had everything in his game. I think the one thing we did talk about was the short ball and how to play the short ball,"" Boucher said in a conversation on Monday (May 12), the day Kohli announced his retirement from Test cricket ""I think the short ball is something that a youngster always gets tested with. I told him, 'Virat, because you're so good off the front foot when the ball's straight, they're going to test you on the back foot when you arrive on the international scene. If you play it well, very quickly they'll go away from bowling short at you'. I just said to him, 'if you arrive on South African shores, we would definitely test you on the short ball knowing that you come from the subcontinent.'""'When you go to Australia, they're definitely going to test you on the short ball because you've come from the subcontinent.' I think my conversations were just trying to help him find his next level and making him aware of what other teams would do to him. From there, he took it upon himself.""""He said to me, 'Bach, can you help me?' I was like, 'Yes, absolutely.' I went and served a couple of tennis balls at him, showed him one or two little techniques. I just worked on a couple of things, tried to impart a little bit of my knowledge on playing the short ball, especially coming from South Africa where you get tested quite a bit.""I did say to him one day, it's not a nice exercise to go into a net and have to work on the short ball because sometimes you do get hurt. Sometimes you get one or two balls around the ears, and it's not nice having to go through that and getting hit on the helmet every now and again. But I think this is where his feistiness and his character came through. He was really eager to become a better cricketer. He really enjoyed the challenge of me hitting tennis balls at his head.""We had a laugh, and it was good fun because I think he trusted that it was coming from a good place from my side. I really enjoyed it because here I am working with someone who at that stage I thought could be the next superstar in Indian cricket. He's lived up to that.""Boucher vividly remembers the first time he met Virat and how the ""feistiness"" in a young Delhi lad caught his attention and reminded him of a younger version of himself.""He was, how do I put it, quite an easy person to speak to. He was very open to listening to people who were older than him and probably more experienced than him. He had a bit – it's difficult to say attitude because attitude comes across the wrong way – but he had a character that he was quite feisty and out there. He loved to be competitive, which I really enjoyed about him because I think I was probably similar when I was a youngster,"" recalls Boucher.""What did stand out was his talent that he had, and if you've got talent and you've got character that comes with it and the feistiness to want to succeed, I think it's always a recipe for success,"" he adds.A young Virat made the most out of Boucher's experience and their initial conversations continued to revolve around cricket. The former cricketer still remembers the chat they had on the art of playing spin, and how it left a lasting impression on Boucher.""I actually chatted to him a lot about spin bowling and how Indian cricketers play spin bowling to try and pick his brain a bit on how they develop from a very young age and what sort of techniques they have to counter the spinning ball,"" he says.""I actually remember the conversation that we had, and it went along the lines of, I just said, 'Virat, you're very talented and you're very young.' You've got the IPL ahead of you now. You're probably going to play close to 20 years of IPL cricket. Sachin Tendulkar started off at a very young age as well, and who's to say that you couldn't be the next Sachin Tendulkar?' I didn't know that he was going to take everything this far and sort of create his own legacy.""Over the years, Virat Kohli carried the burden of being the next Sachin Tendulkar but Boucher staunchly believes it is unfair to compare Tendulkar and Kohli. He sums it up with a crisp response: ""To mention him and Sachin would be doing a disservice to both of them. I think there's only ever one Sachin Tendulkar, and I think there's only ever one Virat Kohli. Both of them are absolute legends of the game.""When it comes to Kohli , a lot of tags have followed him over the years. From being termed arrogant to egoistic, the former India skipper had to deal with a lot of outside noise during his Test career but he managed to deliver the results which were never seen in Indian cricket before. It was under his captaincy that India witnessed a glorious period in Test cricket where they won 40 of the 68 games Kohli led in, losing just 17. The 40 wins made Kohli India's most successful Test captain of all time.""When he stepped into the Indian cricket team, the way that he led people, I think sometimes people were saying it was arrogance, but I don't see it as arrogance. I see it as confidence and also a particular guy who's got a little bit of a different attitude to maybe your normal Indian cricketer. He was never going to stand back and be bullied or pushed into a corner by any other cricketer, which is right,"" says Boucher.""No cricketer should stand back, especially if you're playing for your country. You've earned the right to play for your country, and so has the individual on the other end. There should never be a situation where you feel like you need to be undermined by the opposition. If you can take it, you can give it back. If you give it, you must be able to take it as well. I think Virat was very much like that,"" he adds.Boucher further explains how that Virat inspired the current generation of cricketers with his ""in your face"" attitude. The feistiness, fitness and overall dedication have been hallmarks of Kohli's career and it has rubbed off on the future players as well.""Certainly, he started what the younger generation is now living through as well. They don't stand back for anyone. They're very aggressive. They're in your face. There's a line for everything. You don't want to cross the line or the legality of the game.""But certainly, they go out there, and they don't feel intimidated by anyone. Where maybe in the past, before the Kohli era, maybe there was a little bit of intimidation that crept in. He certainly changed that and changed the way that any young Indian cricketer being brought up in today's world, they're a lot tougher.""Kohli and his old friend ""Bach"" continue to be in touch after all these years but the conversations have now moved on from short-pitch bowling to family and fatherhood.","Virat Kohli announced his retirement from Test cricket on May 12. Kohli credited former South African wicketkeeper-batter Mark Boucher for guiding him during the early years of his international and Indian Premier League (IPL) career. Boucher remembers the first time he met Kohli and how the ""feistiness"" of the young Delhi lad caught his attention.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121126243,imgsize-66086,width-400,resizemode-4/Sachin-Tendulkar.jpg"
