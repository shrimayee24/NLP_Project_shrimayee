A:

A lot of my books have the personal in them. I think this in some ways is the most personal. And it came about because I had this annus horribilis... And for me that was 2023 when I had this shock breast cancer diagnosis. And just as I was going through the treatment, I lost my mother very suddenly, I spoke to her the night before and then the next morning I got a call saying she's gone. And it left me feeling very unmoored. But it also set me off thinking about how I could traverse some of these inner terrains of illness, of grief, these emotional journeys... I've lived in eight countries, in nine different cities since the late 1990s. Doing so I've learned something about the art of travelling well... And then I thought about applying some of these to other kinds of journeys, more metaphorical journeys... And it helped me a lot because I realised that recasting illness and recasting grief and recasting some of these difficult life journeys as plot really helped me to process them and to bring to them an openness and a curiosity that I normally have in my travels to countries.I have a chapter on passportism, essentially a hierarchy that divides people and determines who can travel and who can't. Just as your caste is determined by birth, your passport is also usually determined by birth. It's a throw of the cosmic dice whether you're born in Sudan or whether you're born in the US. But if you happen to be lucky enough to born in the US or Spain, you have the keys to the world... Although I'm in a family of passport Brahmins, I have hung on to my Indian passport. .. We have a friend in, say, Mexico who invites us to a wedding. Everybody is like, yay, we’re going to Mexico. And being an Indian passport holder, my initial reaction is never unalloyed excitement. But I have hung on to this passport and I've tried to unpack why. There's notions of loyalty to the nation but I think there's also something more than that. It's this kind of sense of guilt almost that I have of being such a privileged Indian... And in some ways, that passport is at least to some extent a leveller... And the very liberal countries of the West for whom supposedly racism would be anathema, sexism would be anathema, casteism would be anathema, passportism is okay — so much so that you have these rankings that are public every year saying which is the best passport and which is the worst passport.I've tried through a lot of my work to break down the barrier between those two aspects. A journalist would be like defining my professional life. And being a mother is supposed to be something very private. And I think that's quite disingenuous... I believe this kind of division between the personal and the professional is spurious and it does not serve the interests of not only women, but men either... I feel like when you are writing anything,. .. it's very important to centre and make obvious your own subjectivity...We've had a tradition in foreign correspondence and travel writing of, normally, a white male writer, essentially pretending to take a kind of objective vantage point. They have this very authorial, universalistic voice which obscures the lenses that they are seeing the world through and is just telling you this is the truth... I think whenever we are talking about something, we are describing a version of the truth. And that version is very much determined by who is telling that story. And so I think it's important to make yourself quite transparent. So you are a female, you are a mother. And that is why you are apprehending the world in that way and interpreting the world in that way... You know, when they say ‘women can do it all’, what they actually mean is when you're at work, you pretend that you don't have kids, and when you are with the kids, you have to pretend that you don't have work. And that's just patently, empirically impossible.In the chapter on pedagogy, I talk about this phase that I go through of being this kind of typical Asian tiger mom. A lot of how I process the world is through books. In this instance, it happened to be a book by a writer called Amy Chua, ‘Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother’... So I went through a very misguided phase, at least as far as I'm concerned, given my personal predilections as a parent, of being this tiger mom... Until I realised that, I was. .. creating misery all around. After a few months, I felt my claws retract and the stripes on my body dissolved into colourful polka dots... The last five years we've spent in Spain and there, sometimes I wish people were more tiger momish. They're only concerned about if the kids are playing sports and if they have girlfriends and boyfriends... There's no conversation about how they're doing in math or what university they might want to apply to. So I think it’s about finding a good balance, and also realising all these things are culture-dependent, context-dependent.I think one of the important parts of travelling is to accumulate a variety of different lenses and perspectives and to expand your sense of self... Supposing you're an Indian. You have various assumptions about the world and you don't even realise that these are assumptions because you just think that they're somehow universal norms... You travel, you learn new languages, you experience new cultures, and you understand there's so many different ways in which you can inhabit the world, in which you can translate the world, and hopefully you can accrue more and more of these lenses so that you become a wider person. .. I just use the metaphor of my Chinese name as a way of talking about an extra lens that I acquired by becoming familiar with Chinese culture and Chinese ways of doing things...I think that when we proselytise about the virtues of travel, we also have to keep in mind what we started this discussion off with — passportism, and that not everybody can travel in the same way... So there are other ways of travelling. You can even become a traveller in your neighbourhood. If you walk around your own colony and you look at it with openness and curiosity instead of allowing what is the quotidian to become banal. .. My name, Pallavi, is distorted in so many ways. I've been called Pullover and Pavlova and Pavali. But instead of complaining, I've embraced each iteration. It's just one more way of being.","Author has lived in eight countries, in nine different cities since the late 1990s.

NEW DELHI: Former India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh has spoken openly about the reasons that led to his retirement from cricket in June 2019. Yuvraj stepped away from international cricket and the Indian Premier League after being left out of India’s squad for the ODI World Cup that year.The decision marked the end of a long and emotional journey in the sport he had played since childhood.Yuvraj, now 44, said he no longer felt happy playing the game. He explained that the lack of respect and support around him played a major role in his decision.""I was not enjoying my game. I had a feeling that why am I playing cricket when I'm not enjoying it? I was not feeling supported. I was not feeling respected. And I felt, why do I need to do this when I don't have this? Why am I lingering on to something that I'm not enjoying? Why do I need to play? To prove what? I can't do more than this, mentally or physically, and it was hurting me. And the day I stopped, I was myself again,"" Yuvraj shared during a recent podcast with former Indian tennis star Sania Mirza Yuvraj also looked back at an earlier phase of his life when doubts were raised about his talent.""Now, when I look back at it, I just think he didn't have the time to have a proper look at me. He was just like being nice to my dad. Then obviously, he was playing for India at that time, so he probably would have said that. I was 13-14 at that time, just figuring out a sport.

Sanju Samson headache for Team India | Is Ishan Kishan the right choice?

Poll Do you think Sanju Samson should be dropped from the playing XI? Yes, he needs to be replaced. No, he deserves more chances.

NEW DELHI: Sanju Samson’s frustrating run with the bat continued in the ongoing T20I series against New Zealand, with another start going unconverted — and this time, batting legend Sunil Gavaskar did not hold back. The former India captain delivered a stinging on-air assessment after Samson was bowled for 24 off 15 balls in the fourth T20I, calling out glaring technical flaws that, in his view, summed up the wicketkeeper-batter’s struggles.Chasing a daunting 216 at the ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium, India were under early pressure after losing Abhishek Sharma and captain Suryakumar Yadav cheaply. Samson initially looked promising, striking three crisp boundaries and a six to briefly steady the innings. However, just as he appeared to be finding his rhythm, New Zealand skipper Mitchell Santner struck, sneaking one through to rattle Samson’s stumps.Gavaskar, on commentary, immediately zeroed in on what he felt was the root cause of the dismissal — Samson’s footwork, or lack of it.“My first impression is that there was no footwork at all. Not very sure whether there was any turn.First impression was he was just standing there making room and playing through the offside,” Gavaskar said, offering a blunt initial diagnosis.After reviewing the replay, Gavaskar doubled down, expanding on the technical lapse that has repeatedly hurt Samson against spin.“Like I said, hardly any movement of the feet. Going outside leg-stump, once again exposing all three stumps and when you miss, the bowler's gonna hit, and that's what happened to Sanju Samson the second time around,” he added.The 24-run knock was Samson’s highest score in the series so far, following earlier failures of 10, 6 and 0, but it did little to ease the scrutiny. With Ishan Kishan impressing at No. 3 earlier in the series and the T20 World Cup at home drawing closer, pressure is mounting rapidly on Samson to justify his place in the XI.","Sanju Samson was bowled for 24 off 15 balls in the fourth T20I in Visakhapatnam.

Back story:



NBC Sports ’ Mike Florio reportedly calls Bill Polian top suspect

Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy reportedly calls Bill Polian liar and coward

NFL Insider Ari Meirov posted on X: “From the ESPN report: Bill Polian was a vocal figure in the Hall of Fame deliberations involving Bill Belichick, with Spygate and Deflategate coming up among voters during discussions.Per a voter who spoke anonymously, Polian — the former [Buffalo] Bills and [Indianapolis] Colts GM and longtime Patriots rival — told some voters he believed Belichick should “wait a year” as penance for Spygate.”An hour later, Sports Illustrated’s Matt Verderame posted on X: “I just spoke on the phone with Bill Polian and asked whether he was an influence on Bill Belichick being snubbed by the Hall of Fame. His quote: “That’s totally and categorically untrue. I voted for him.”NFL Insider Adam Schefter reported on X that the eight-time Super Bowl-winning head coach is not a first ballot Hall of Famer. He fell short of the 40 out of 50 votes [80% necessary] needed for induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.Now that the North Carolina Tar Heels coach did not make the ballot; despite possessing one of the most successful coaching careers in NFL history, people may have started to look for loopholes or for who did not vote for the New England Patriots legendary coach.NBC Sports’ Mike Florio said, “There are some tangible theories as to what happened. I’m gonna put a pin in that to focus on the Bill Polian angle. It was prominently mentioned in the story from ESPN.com: Reportedly, Polian was leading the charge and would be the one most likely to do so. He’s the top suspect if you’re looking at the 50-vote.Who’s the one with the biggest axe to grind against Bill Belichick? It’s the guy who did battle with Belichick most often throughout the decade of the 2000s. It’s the guy who tried to get the rules changed, new point of emphasis for illegal contact with receivers and the Peyton Manning offense…”Dave Portnoy calls Belichick’s snub absurd and says, “This is what happens when you create a society of losers, of people who refuse to acknowledge greatness, who complain, make excuses, [---], and [---].Bill Polian is certainly a leader amongst those. He’s a liar and a coward. He’s somebody who could never beat the [New England] Patriots; they changed the rules of football because of Bill Polian. They couldn’t beat the Patriots. They whine, they complain, much like after the Patriots beat the [Denver] Broncos in bad weather.”Portnoy shared that when great teams win, everybody looks at them and feels they cheated or did something wrong. The Patriots “kicked our [---] for two decades. It wasn’t Spygate, it wasn’t Deflategate, it’s none of that. You got to look in the mirror.”The founder says there are people who won’t look themselves in the mirror and say, ‘I can’t beat that guy. I have to get better. I have to be the best I can be. Hats off to that team.’","NBC Sports’ Mike Florio said, “There are some tangible theories as to what happened. I’m gonna put a pin in that to focus on the Bill Polian angle.

Todd Monken named Browns head coach: What it means for the team



After weeks of searching, the Cleveland Browns have finally found their new head coach. The Browns went with experience over youth, hiring a coach who has a solid track record. The team decided to go with experience instead of youth by hiring a coach who has a proven record of success. The Browns chose to hire a coach with experience rather than a younger, less proven candidate. For fans who have seen many changes over the years, Todd Monken’s hiring gives hope for some stability and a clear plan for the team.At 59, Monken is older than most first-time NFL head coaches. But his long experience in both college football and the NFL makes him a strong choice to lead the Browns. However, his long experience in both college football and the NFL makes him a strong and reliable choice for the team. His work as Baltimore’s offensive coordinator shows he can lead high-powered offenses, a skill the Browns hope will help turn their team around.Todd Monken was officially announced as Cleveland’s head coach on Wednesday, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter. He spent the last three seasons as the Ravens’ offensive coordinator, helping Baltimore rank fourth, third, and 11th in scoring during that time. Monken’s offense used Lamar Jackson’s versatility and Derrick Henry’s power to create one of the league’s most effective attacks.Cleveland’s coaching search had included younger candidates like Grant Udinski, Chris Shula, Nick Scheelhase, and Mike McDaniel. When those options fell through, Monken became the best available choice. His combination of experience and readiness made him an attractive option for a team looking for immediate stability.The Browns aren’t starting from scratch. Defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz has helped the Browns build one of the NFL’s top defenses. Since 2023, the team has allowed the fewest yards per game (298.6) and made it hardest for opponents to get a first down on third down (33.8%). With such a strong defense, Monken can focus on improving the offense without changing much on defense.Monken’s main challenge will be balancing the strong defense with a modern, flexible offense. If he gets it right, the Browns could finally become a team that wins consistently. The hire also impacts Baltimore, as the Ravens now need to fill the gap Monken leaves behind, and it changes the dynamic of the coaching carousel in the NFL.For a team with only three playoff appearances since 2000, Monken’s hiring is a step toward stability and growth. Browns fans will be waiting to see if his experience can turn promise into results.","Todd Monken was officially announced as Cleveland’s head coach on Wednesday.

Chiefs WR Rashee Rice takes ‘no comment’ stance amid abuse allegations from ex-gf,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/chiefs-wr-rashee-rice-takes-no-comment-stance-amid-abuse-allegations-from-ex-gf/articleshow/127725387.cms,"Image via Getty

Allegations surface through social media posts

NFL and Chiefs acknowledge situation

Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice has chosen not to speak publicly after serious abuse allegations surfaced online from his former girlfriend earlier this month. The situation has drawn league-wide attention, with the NFL confirming it is monitoring developments, even as no formal charges have been filed so far.Rice has remained silent despite repeated attempts by the media to get his side of the story.The controversy began when Rice’s ex-girlfriend Dacoda Nichole Jones, shared a series of Instagram posts showing visible bruises and injuries on her face and body. In her captions, Jones described years of alleged abuse and claimed the incidents occurred in Kansas and Texas.While she did not directly name Rice in the posts, she identified the alleged abuser as the father of her two children which makes the connection clear.

Trey Hendrickson’s future with Cincinnati Bengals looks uncertain amid key offseason decisions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/trey-hendricksons-future-with-cincinnati-bengals-looks-uncertain-amid-key-offseason-decisions/articleshow/127719050.cms,"Trey Hendrickson’s time in Cincinnati may be nearing its end (Image via: Getty Images)

Cincinnati Bengals facing inevitable decision on Trey Hendrickson



Ocho PHONE CALLS Bengals Front Office to find a TRADE for Trey Hendrickson! Unc OVER IT! | Nightcap

The Cincinnati Bengals enter the offseason at a turning point after a frustrating previous year’s campaign that failed to meet expectations. While Joe Burrow and the offense remain the foundation of the franchise, the defense has become the raising concern. Nowhere is that more evident than in the pass rush, where uncertainty surrounds one of the most productive defenders in team history.Trey Hendrickson’s future in Cincinnati appears increasingly bleak, and all signs suggest the Bengals are preparing for life without him. With free agency approaching and younger edge rushers still developing, the situation places added pressure on the front office to reshape a unit that once anchored the defense.ESPN’s Ben Baby framed the situation as increasingly decisive. “Once again, the Bengals will have to make a decision on Hendrickson’s contract,” Baby wrote. “But unlike in previous years, this one is much clearer. The odds are very slim that Cincinnati and Hendrickson, who is arguably the best free-agent signing in franchise history, will find a path forward.”Cincinnati tried to delay this outcome a year ago by placing the franchise tag on Hendrickson before agreeing to a one-year, $29 million deal for the 2025 season.The move bought time but did little to resolve the larger question of long-term value versus age and durability. Hendrickson’s 2025 season, cut short by injury amid the team’s overall struggles, only complicated matters further.Even at 31, Hendrickson is still one of the league’s most reliable pass rushers. What he did in Cincinnati doesn’t need much explanation. He posted back-to-back 17.5-sack seasons and wrapped up his time with the Bengals with 61 total sacks. Over five seasons, he made four Pro Bowls and earned first-team All-Pro recognition, making him one of the most successful free-agent additions in franchise history.Still, the Bengals appear ready to turn the page. Myles Murphy and Shemar Stewart represent the next wave on the edge, even if neither is yet a finished product. Financial flexibility and long-term planning seem to outweigh the appeal of retaining a veteran star, especially as Cincinnati looks to rebalance its roster after a disappointing year.Hendrickson is expected to draw strong interest on the open market and should land a sizable deal elsewhere. For the Bengals, his departure would likely result in a compensatory pick in the 2027 NFL Draft. It is a small return for a player who defined their pass rush for years, but one that reflects where the franchise stands.After five seasons and a long list of achievements, Trey Hendrickson’s run in Cincinnati is likely coming to a close, marking the end of a highly productive chapter and the beginning of a risky but necessary transition for the Bengals’ defense.","Trey Hendrickson’s future in Cincinnati appears increasingly bleak, and all signs suggest the Bengals are preparing for life without him.

Ben Roethlisberger wants Mike McCarthy to be given a chance

Big Ben & Charlie Batch talk Mike McCarthy as Head Coach, Future of the Steelers and more! Ep 119



Mike McCarthy background and connection with Aaron Rodgers

Former Dallas Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy has big shoes to fill in Pittsburgh after Mike Tomlin’s departure following 19 years. Steelers Nation holds deep love and boundless respect for Tomlin. He has an impeccable 19-year streak of non-losing seasons with 193 wins, 114 losses, and two ties.Imagining someone capable of filling those shoes and representing Steelers Nation seems almost impossible. If someone from the Pittsburgh team vouched for the new head coach, maybe then Steelers Nation would consider it. That is where two-time Super Bowl champion Ben Roethlisberger steps in.“Do you think that was the biggest issue with McCarthy? Is that his age? Like from the fans’ perspective.” Roethlisberger said on his Footbahlin podcast. “There’s Pittsburgh ties there, that should trump a lot of things. I know people want this overhaul, and this new guy...He [McCarthy] is a new breath in the sense that his message is gonna be completely different. He bled black and gold as a kid. Isn’t that all you want for a head coach? A guy that went to that school. To me, that trumps so much! I might take a guy, as a head coach of this team, that has a heart and bleeds for this team more than a guy that is just this offensive-minded genius…There’s something about that that people are not getting. They just want this whole new shakeup… I think people are nuts.Give this guy a chance. He’s got a proven track record… I’m mad that people don’t give this guy a chance because he wants this job. I want everyone to call in and tell me how wrong they were in three years.”McCarthy was born and grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His mother was a secretary and worked in restaurants. His father was a firefighter. He attended Bishop Boyle High School and went to Baker University, where he was a two-time all-conference tight end for the Baker Wildcats. In 1987, after going undrafted, he earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration.McCarthy’s football coaching journey began at Fort Hays State in 1987 as a graduate assistant. He then served as a graduate assistant for the Pittsburgh Panthers college football team, where he also served as a wide receivers coach.The 62-year-old coach entered the NFL as an offensive quality control coach for the Kansas City Chiefs in 1993. He was the Chiefs’ quarterbacks coach for three years, until 1998. Then, the same position for the Green Bay Packers in 1999. He became the New Orleans Saints’ offensive coordinator in 2000 and served for four years.He was the Saints’ offensive coordinator for a year, then in 2006, he was promoted to head coach of the Green Bay Packers. There, he met Pittsburgh Steelers former quarterback Aaron Rodgers [now a free agent]. Reportedly, McCarthy expressed a strong desire for Rodgers to return as his quarterback.McCarthy coached the Packers until 2018. He took a coaching break in the 2019 NFL season. Then for four years, he served as head coach of the Jerry Jones’ Dallas Cowboys, led by signal-caller Dak Prescott.The Super Bowl XLV champion spent the 2025 season away from coaching, which was when Rodgers joined Pittsburgh. On Jan. 24, 2026, he was hired as the Steelers’ 17th head coach. His record as head coach is 174-112-2.","Former Dallas Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy has big shoes to fill in Pittsburgh after Mike Tomlin’s departure.

The Steelers’ wide receiver group has depth considerations beyond DK Metcalf, and the team will look to strengthen the position through free agency and the draft.Among Henry’s immediate priorities is working with 2024 third-round pick Roman Wilson. The Michigan product has shown some potential, and with the right guidance, the coaching staff hopes he can improve and contribute more regularly to the offense.Although there are challenges, Henry’s experience in developing players should help him work well with both veteran and younger receivers. He will also focus on helping the group gel, improve timing with the quarterback, and become more dependable targets in the passing game. How the Steelers’ leadership and coaching staff collaborate will also influence how the receiving group performs.Henry’s coaching, combined with the Steelers’ roster moves, will play a key role in strengthening the wide receiver group. With a mix of experienced players and young talent, the team will work to get the best out of everyone while filling any gaps in the lineup.

Jason Gregor believes that Toronto Maple Leafs are done with their season with no playoff hope

The Maple Leafs' playoff window appears to have slammed shut. Following a devastating 7-4 loss to the Buffalo Sabres on Tuesday night, Toronto finds itself eight points adrift of the Eastern Conference wild card positions. This loss marked the end of a devastating five-game run at the ScotiaBank Arena.Despite being the home side, Toronto could only get one point off an OT loss against the Red Wings last week. But while the losses have surely hurt the Maple Leafs’ pride, with just 57 points across 53 games, an even bleaker future remains for the franchise as they stand seventh in the Atlantic Division.The Maple Leafs have had a tough run since the season began. But their performance since the winter break ended has been horrible. Hockey analyst Jason Gregor even believes that with just 29 games remaining, Toronto might be missing the postseason this year.He didn't mince words about Toronto's situation. ""Leafs unofficially eliminated from playoffs last night?"" Gregor wrote. ""They are 8 pts back of MTL, BUF, and BOS now. With Florida also ahead of them. Will be interesting to see how they approach the deadline and the off-season.""The Leafs trail Montreal, Buffalo, and Boston, all sitting at 65 points, for the final playoff spots as the Panthers add another obstacle ahead of them in the standings.The Leafs had already failed to get a win in their last four games as they entered yesterday’s game as the obvious underdogs.But while everyone knew the Sabres were in red-hot form, Rasmus Dahlin’s first career hat trick made sure that Buffalo got their 19th win in their last 23 games. But while the away team got to extend their unbeaten run, Joseph Woll emerged as the victim last night.The netminder was only able to make 24 saves out of the 28 shots he faced, while the Leafs’ offense was unable to stand up to Dahlin’s scoring. With playoff hopes effectively extinguished, general manager Brad Treliving faces a critical decision at the March 6 trade deadline.Does Toronto embrace a seller's role and capitalize on expiring contracts, or attempt a retool around its core? The Maple Leafs have multiple players who turn UFA at the end of the season, so it will be smart for Toronto to offload some of their biggest contracts before March 6.Deeper roster decisions loom around players like Oliver Ekman-Larsson, Conor Timmins, and Dakota Joshua. The Leafs embark on a six-game road trip beginning Thursday in Seattle, where they'll attempt to salvage pride from a season that's spiraled into disaster.","Toronto lost 7-4 to the Buffalo Sabres on Tuesday night.

The Milwaukee Bucks and Giannis Antetokounmpo carefully move toward an inevitable split

Contract timing and trade logistics make the Giannis Antetokounmpo deal difficult to finalize

The rumors surrounding the NBA trade deadline have officially begun. On Wednesday, January 28, there was significant news regarding Giannis Antetokounmpo's future with the Milwaukee Bucks. Before the trade deadline on February 5, the two-time MVP is reportedly prepared for a new home.According to league sources who spoke to ESPN on Wednesday, the Bucks are beginning to listen to multiple teams' strong proposals. The market has reportedly lagged because a number of teams with the assets required to make a bid for Antetokounmpo have been waiting for him to become formally available via a trade.Antetokounmpo has previously stated that he's prepared to leave the Bucks, according to an ESPN article that was released on Wednesday morning. Allegedly, neither Antetokounmpo nor the Bucks have wanted to take responsibility for what is turning out to be inevitable, so they have been cautious about the optics.The Bucks are now facing serious concerns about their future course, which has prompted candid discussions between the two parties. Although Milwaukee is not required to trade the two-time MVP, the Bucks are reportedly more willing than ever to consider offers for Antetokounmpo before the trading deadline, according to ESPN.Additionally, as per the league insiders, several teams have heard that the Bucks are now accepting Antetokounmpo proposals between now and the deadline. However, Milwaukee has reportedly made it clear that the team is not in a rush to finalize a move.The sources have said that the organization is also prepared to negotiate Antetokounmpo's future in the offseason if it doesn't meet its perceived price point for a young, elite player or an excess of draft picks.The Bucks may also be able to determine which teams can make more impressive draft selections in June if they wait until the summer. According to sources, Antetokounmpo has been telling the Bucks for months that he feels it's time to part ways after more than 12 years together.The mechanics of getting all the moving pieces together by next Thursday would be challenging because a deal like this might also need a third or fourth team. According to ESPN, prospective suitors believe Milwaukee is open to receiving proposals.The team now has a lottery pick in the draft, with both the New Orleans Pelicans' and its own selection being less advantageous. On October 1, Antetokounmpo will be able to sign a $275 million, four-year supermax deal. If he declines a $62.8 million player option that summer, he could become an unrestricted free agent in the 2027 offseason.Meanwhile, when asked on January 19 if he was certain he would remain with the Bucks for the rest of the season, Antetokounmpo said:""I don't know. I don't know. I take it day by day.""Although there is no assurance that he will go before the trade deadline on February 5, several NBA teams will want to do so.

How LIV Golf landed Rolex: $12B PGA Tour sponsor signs deal but avoids full branding rights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/how-liv-golf-landed-rolex-12b-pga-tour-sponsor-signs-deal-but-avoids-full-branding-rights/articleshow/127727695.cms,"How LIV Golf landed Rolex $12B PGA Tour sponsor signs deal but avoids full branding rights (Image via Getty)

What the Rolex agreement means for LIV Golf’s future

LIV Golf has secured a surprising partnership with luxury watch brand Rolex. The deal links one of the PGA Tour’s biggest sponsors with LIV Golf, but with clear limits. Rolex will not appear as a full on-course sponsor at LIV Golf events. Instead, the agreement focuses only on premium hospitality access. The move signals growing acceptance of LIV Golf while also showing that major brands remain cautious. According to reports shared by golf industry insiders, Rolex will not place its iconic clocks on LIV Golf courses.This is a major shift from its long-standing role on the PGA Tour, where Rolex branding is highly visible. The agreement allows Rolex customers to attend LIV Golf events through exclusive hospitality experiences. It does not include broadcast branding, on-course signage, or title sponsorship rights. This structure protects Rolex’s global image while still testing a relationship with LIV Golf. For LIV Golf, even a limited association with a $12 billion brand is seen as a major step forward. The league has recently retained top players and continues to push for Official World Golf Ranking status.The Rolex deal shows that LIV Golf is attracting interest from elite sponsors, even if cautiously.By focusing on hospitality rather than branding, Rolex avoids public alignment with the league’s ongoing disputes with traditional golf bodies. At the same time, LIV Golf gains validation by partnering with a luxury brand trusted across professional sports. Industry analysts note that this type of deal could open the door to similar partnerships. Other sponsors may follow with low-risk agreements before committing fully. For LIV Golf, this approach builds credibility without forcing brands into controversial exposure. It also strengthens LIV Golf’s appeal to high-end fans who value premium experiences.LIV Golf's contract with Rolex solidifies the assumption that LIV is on solid ground. This contract backs many LIV players like Rahm and DeChambeau to remain committed to LIV Golf for the long term. Other players, like Koepka, went back to how they played before LIV Golf. As this loyalty has been essential in keeping LIV Golf moving forward at such a crucial time, we know that if LIV Golf earns an Official World Golf Ranking, the commercial value of LIV Golf will skyrocket, and this may lead Rolex and others to increase their future sponsorship involvement. For now, Rolex and LIV Golf have a selective relationship regarding this partnership that is a good sign for LIV Golf's future. The Rolex limited partnership, combined with some of the professional golf world's previous reluctance to partner with LIV Golf, demonstrates how much progress LIV Golf is making in the professional game of golf. There is a lot of cautious optimism about how the major brands perceive LIV Golf in their respective sponsorship strategies.","LIV Golf has secured a surprising partnership with luxury watch brand Rolex.

LeBron James’ strong return fuels belief that his NBA journey is far from over amidst his sciatica injury

LeBron James’ leadership and production continue to define his greatness even at 41

LeBron James has emphasized his intense dedication to longevity once more. James continues to modify his lifestyle in an effort to achieve high performance at a time when other athletes have long since retired. While recuperating from an early-season sciatica ailment, he also made a big dietary adjustment.In an effort to relieve pressure on his back and joints, LeBron has drastically reduced his weight and quit consuming alcohol throughout his rehabilitation, according to ESPN's Dave McMenamin. The decision was made during a difficult period earlier in the season when he was momentarily hindered by injury and had to take some time off from the court to ponder. Instead of slowing down, James intensified his efforts.LeBron James missed the first game of the season for the first time in his 23-year career due to sciatica, which kept him out of action for the first 14 games. Since James's demise is unavoidably near, JJ Redick had the chance to observe what would happen in the future, and he soon received his response.The Los Angeles Lakers had a lot of issues at the beginning of the season, but Luka Doncic and Austin Reaves performed admirably and led the team to victories that kept them close to the top of the Western Conference.Even though many questioned James due to his advanced age, he was actively practicing for his return to the court during that time.After the summer vacation, the injury, and the years that are unquestionably there, LBJ's poor start to the season was to be expected. However, he has demonstrated remarkable form in recent weeks, persuading many that this cannot be his last season.Even a return to the Cleveland Cavaliers would be a feasible option, according to ESPN's Dave McMenamin. He added that if James decided to return to Cleveland for his 24th NBA season and third stint with the organization, the Cavaliers would be happy to welcome him back this summer, according to numerous team and league sources who spoke with ESPN.McMenamin added:“There's no telling the ride the Lakers could still go on this spring, especially if James can find that cape to put back on. While James is eight years older, he has shown a similar commitment to this season's Lakers team, sources said…”He continued:“He missed the first 14 games because of sciatica. But James stopped drinking alcohol during his rehab, and he has slimmed down considerably, hoping to take pressure off his back and joints and to ""keep up with the young guys..”As the season went on, the choice was a part of a larger physical reset meant to enhance recuperation, conditioning, and durability. It also demonstrated how carefully James maintains every aspect of his body at this late stage of his career.Talking about James, star forward Kevin Love said of those 2017-18 Cavs:""We weren't supposed to make it that far… I mean, you look at the makeup of that team and the inexperience, even more so. It wasn't a team that really had enough of a supporting cast to make it to that level.. But because LeBron took us there and put us on his shoulders, we were able to get to that point.""James has continued to be a key player for the Lakers on both ends of the court despite turning 41 during the season. He has continued to put in a lot of work, be the team's emotional leader, and contribute often as a scorer and playmaker.LeBron James, 41, is still one of the NBA's best players in his 23rd season, averaging 22.4 points, 6 rebounds, and 6.7 assists per game.",LeBron James missed the first 14 games of the NBA season due to sciatica. The 41-year-old has drastically reduced his weight and quit drinking alcohol during his rehabilitation.

New driver's entry in the truck series race at Daytona



Tony Stewart to compete with two seasoned drivers



The Cup Series’ Daytona 500 is the most anticipated NASCAR race of the year. But with drivers like Tony Stewart stepping in, the Truck Series seems to be leaving a bigger impression. A lot of viewers are actually more eager for the 250-mile event. Not because of the brutal and intense races happening in the series, but because of the legendary and seasoned Cup Series drivers that will be back. Tony Stewart's first appearance in the series in more than 20 years is the focus of all the excitement.Although his experience was thought to be a dominating factor in the race, new drivers have just been revealed, and one of Jimmie Johnson's LMC drivers will also compete.John Hunter Nemechek, who has recorded a few top-10 finishes with Legacy Motor Club over the past two years, will make a unique appearance in the Truck Series at Daytona with Halmar Friesen Racing. He will be driving the #62 Toyota for the event, and DriveValue.com is sponsoring his limited entry with the squad. It would be an understatement to say that he is eager for the race.“I’m really excited to get back behind the wheel in the Truck Series, especially at a place like Daytona,” Nemechek stated.“I’m extremely grateful to Halmar Friesen Racing and Stewart [Friesen] for the opportunity to drive the No. 62 Toyota. Daytona is such a special track, and any time you get the chance to compete there, it means a lot. I’m looking forward to making the most of this opportunity and having a strong run with the support of HFR and DriveValue.com.”This will be Nemechek’s 150th race start in the Truck Series. It’s safe to say he has a lot of experience, as in the past decade, he has won 13 races in the series. While Tony Stewart is well-known for having an extended career in the Cup Series, his Truck Series numbers are fewer than Nemechek's.Stewart’s Cup Series experience was the only thing that set him apart in the Truck Series field this year at Daytona. Nevertheless, the participants’ list seems to be getting updated every few days. Henderson Motorsports announced Corey LaJoie, their unique competitor, before John Hunter Nemechek made his announcement. The veteran has raced 276 Cup Series races over the past decade, making him one of the most seasoned drivers on the Truck Series field at Daytona. Furthermore, in the nine Truck races he ran in 2025, LaJoie finished 7th in the top 10. Truly a legendary run.His more recent experience in the series will prove to be helpful, particularly when racing against Tony Stewart. Both of them, along with John Hunter Nemechek, will make the Truck Series race at Daytona an interesting run this year.","Tony Stewart's first appearance in the series in more than 20 years is the focus of all the excitement.

Vancouver Canucks continue to have one of their worst seasons ever

The Vancouver Canucks' nightmare season reached a new low on Tuesday night. A 5-2 defeat to the San Jose Sharks extended Vancouver's misery to three consecutive losses and dropped their record to a dismal 17-31-5.The loss capped another forgettable night at Rogers Arena, where the Canucks have managed just one victory through the first six games of their eight-game homestand. Elias Pettersson, who registered two assists in the losing effort, offered a brutally honest assessment of his team's struggles.""I think there are a lot of things that need to be better,"" Pettersson said. ""I think our structure can be better. I think when there's time to make a play, we need to make a play, and then that leads to the next play and the next play."" When asked to specify what needs improvement, Pettersson's answer was telling: ""Pretty well everything.""The Canucks' problems were evident from the opening minutes. After Tom Willander gave Vancouver an early lead just 1:15 into the game, San Jose responded with three goals in a devastating 4:04 span.Kevin Lankinen surrendered three goals on six shots before coach Adam Foote mercifully pulled him at the 5:55 mark of the first period.Nikita Tolopilo allowed two goals on 27 shots in relief as the Sharks extended their lead to 5-1 before Filip Hronek's third-period power play goal provided a consolation marker.The goaltending disaster came hours after Vancouver announced that Thatcher Demko will miss the remainder of the season following hip surgery, leaving an already depleted roster scrambling for answers between the pipes. Pettersson acknowledged the team's repeated failures without making excuses.""Every time we lose, it sucks,"" he said. ""We've been on that side a lot this year. We've just got to find a way or it's going to be... it's hard to put into words,"" he said. “I mean, obviously we're trying. Coach is trying; we're all trying. We're not going out to just give up. But we have to be better.""The numbers paint a grim picture. Vancouver has posted a 1-12-2 record over their last 15 games, transforming from playoff contender to lottery favorite in spectacular fashion.

Stonehenge mystery solved? Study reveals how 25-tonne stones reached the site in southern England,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/stonehenge-mystery-solved-study-reveals-how-25-tonne-stones-reached-the-site-in-southern-england/articleshow/127561744.cms,"Researchers uncovered the truth behind Stonehenge’s 25 tonne stones

Salisbury Plain shows no sign of ancient ice

Sarsens were local but still demanding

Bluestones point clearly to human effort

What the science changes and what it does not





Stonehenge, located on open chalk terrain in southern England, is identifiable but curiously unexplained. For decades, one practical question has hung over the site without being resolved. How did stones weighing hundreds of tonnes arrive here before wheels, metal tools, and written plans? A recent study done by geologists at Curtin University solidifies that disagreement. The researchers looked at small mineral grains in nearby river sediments to check if glaciers had transported the stones south during the Ice Age. The results indicate away from the ice and towards the people. The area surrounding Salisbury Plain has no chemical signs of glacial transit. Instead, sediments reflect local recycling. This lends weight to the hypothesis that Neolithic communities deliberately moved the stones over long distances on their own.The research “Detrital zircon–apatite fingerprinting challenges glacial transport of Stonehenge’s megaliths” focuses on detrital minerals, mainly zircon and apatite, found in streams that drain Salisbury Plain. These grains act as long-lived markers of where sediment has travelled. If glaciers had crossed the area, they would likely have left behind mineral signatures from Wales or northern Britain.That signal is absent. The zircon ages instead match rocks already known from southern England, suggesting the material has been recycled locally rather than dumped by ice. This matters because glacial transport has often been used as a convenient explanation. If ice sheets had carried the stones close to Stonehenge, human effort could be seen as minimal. The new data makes that position harder to hold.The study also reinforces a growing consensus among geomorphologists. There is little physical evidence that glaciers ever reached Salisbury Plain during the Pleistocene. No clear moraines, no consistent erratic trails, no buried till layers. While ice did extend far into Britain during earlier cold periods, its southern limits remain well north of the monument.Fine sediments can travel far beyond glaciers through meltwater. Large stones usually do not. The absence of glacial fingerprints in the surrounding sediment makes it unlikely that multi-tonne blocks arrived by chance.Not all of Stonehenge came from far away. The largest stones, the sarsens, were sourced from West Woods, about 25 kilometres to the north. That distance may sound modest, but the stones weigh around 25 tonnes each. Moving them would still have required planning, labour and time. The mineral analysis does not focus on sarsens directly, but it supports a broader pattern. Stonehenge was not constructed using random materials that happened to be located nearby. Its materials were selected and brought in with intent.The smaller bluestones tell a sharper story. Their geological fingerprints match outcrops in the Preseli Hills of west Wales, around 230 kilometres away. Some stones may have travelled by sea for part of that journey, others overland. Either way, the distances involved rule out casual movement. One stone stands out even more. The Altar Stone appears to come from the Orcadian Basin in northeast Scotland. If correct, that implies a journey of more than 700 kilometres. No known ice route explains this. Human organisation does.The study does not describe exactly how the stones were moved. Sledges, rollers and boats remain plausible tools. What it does change is the balance of probability. Stonehenge looks less like a monument finished by chance and more like one completed through sustained effort. There is no single moment where the mystery disappears. Instead, the space for easy answers narrows. The stones arrived because people brought them. That idea now sits more comfortably with the evidence, even if the work behind it remains only partly visible.","Researchers looked at small mineral grains in nearby river sediments to check if glaciers had transported the stones south during the Ice Age.

Former meteorologist Roland Steadham dies in a plane crash in Idaho



Roland Steadham's career



Passion beyond the forecast: His other passionate vision



Roland Steadham's family and legacy







Roland Steadham, a familiar face in South Florida and Idaho broadcasting, reportedly died Tuesday in a small plane crash in Idaho. It seems the accident occurred northwest of Boise on the Payette River. Deputies with the Gem County Sheriff’s Office responded before 11 AM after a report of the crash. Investigators believe the plane may have clipped a power line before crashing on ice in the river. Two men on board were fatally injured. Steadham, a veteran meteorologist and a commercially licensed pilot, was one of the victims. Friends and colleagues are remembering him not just for his skill on-air, but for his adventurous spirit and decades of weather forecasting across the country.Steadham leaves behind a large family, including his wife, six children, and grandchildren. His passing has reportedly shocked many in the broadcasting community and viewers who grew up watching him deliver forecasts with clarity and warmth.As reported by NBC 6 Florida, the accident occurred near the Payette River, northwest of Boise. Deputies reportedly responded before 11 am after receiving a call about a small plane crash.Investigators believe the plane may have clipped a power line, spun out of control, and then crashed on ice in the river. Both male occupants on board were fatally injured. One of the victims was confirmed to be Roland Steadham, formerly chief meteorologist at WTVJ-NBC6 and later at KBOI-TV in Idaho, beloved by colleagues and viewers alike.Steadham began his career in meteorology more than 35 years ago, according to Idaho News reports. He spent a significant part of that time forecasting hurricanes and severe thunderstorms in South Florida. Later, he moved west, where he reported on snowstorms and extreme weather across states like Utah and Idaho.At WTVJ-NBC6, he served as chief meteorologist from 1996 to 2006. His work during that period reportedly earned him respect for both accuracy and engaging presentation. After moving to Idaho, he continued to make an impact at KBOI-TV, the CBS affiliate, sharing forecasts with viewers while also mentoring younger meteorologists.It seems his experience ranged from tropical weather to blizzards;a rare mix that few in the field achieve. Experts say that kind of versatility makes a meteorologist not just competent, but memorable.Steadham’s life wasn’t limited to television. He was also an avid pilot and skydiver. According to his station bio, he had logged over 3,000 hours flying everything from competition aerobatics to twin-engine jets and gliders. He reportedly completed over 700 skydives. Mountains and rivers were his playground. In the summers, he kayaked Idaho rivers with his wife and daughters. In spring and fall, he rode dirt bikes through the mountains.It appears he lived life at full throttle, both on-screen and off. Colleagues often noted how his adventurous hobbies mirrored his fearless approach to broadcasting. Small details, like the twinkle in his eye during a forecast or an anecdote about flying, made him relatable to viewers.Roland Steadham was the son of a Cuban immigrant and reportedly took pride in his Latin heritage. He spoke fluent Spanish and often connected with diverse communities throughout his career. He attended Brigham Young University and the University of Utah, finishing his meteorology education through the Mississippi State Meteorology Program.He leaves behind six children, grandchildren, and a spouse who reportedly shared in his love of adventure. Many in the community remember him not just as a weather expert, but as a mentor, father, and friend.As reported, Steadham received both the American Meteorological Society and National Weather Association Seal of Approval, recognitions that highlight the respect he earned in his field.","Roland Steadham, a former chief meteorologist at WTVJ-NBC6 and later at KBOI-TV in Idaho, reportedly died Tuesday in a small plane crash in Idaho.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh government on Wednesday cleared its shooting team to travel to India for next month’s Asian Rifle and Pistol Championships, even as it recently refused permission for the national cricket team to take part in the T20 World Cup in India citing ""security concerns"".The continental shooting event will be held at the Dr Karni Singh Shooting Range in New Delhi from February 2 to 14. Seventeen countries are expected to participate, with over 300 shooters in action. The T20 World Cup, meanwhile, is scheduled across India and Sri Lanka from February 7 to March 8.Bangladesh will send two rifle shooters, who will compete in three events. The team will include 21-year-old women’s rifle shooter Arefin Shaira and 26-year-old Olympian Md Robiul Islam. Both will take part in the 10m air rifle individual events before pairing up for the mixed team competition.There had been uncertainty over Bangladesh’s participation in the shooting championships after the country pulled out of the T20 World Cup. However, the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) confirmed on Wednesday that the Bangladesh shooters are set to compete.“So far there is no news that the Bangladesh team is not coming.Their team is coming, no doubt about it,” NRAI secretary Rajiv Bhatia told news agency PTI.“We at NRAI are in regular touch with them (Bangladesh federation officials). The Ministry of External Affairs has given its clearance and we have forwarded it to the (Indian) embassy for visa process,” he added.A report in Dhaka’s Daily Sun said the Bangladesh government had formally approved the shooting team’s tour of India.“The Youth and Sports Ministry issued the official government order (GO) on Wednesday, clearing the team to compete in the championship scheduled to take place from February 2 to 14. The decision comes despite Bangladesh cancelling the national cricket team’s tour of India for the T20 World Cup earlier due to security concerns,” the report said.According to the report, the Bangladesh government believes the shooting event will “not pose significant security risks, as the competition is set to be held indoors at a secured venue (Karni Singh Range)”.The confusion followed the Bangladesh Cricket Board’s decision not to send its team to India for the T20 World Cup, citing security concerns after pacer Mustafizur Rahman was excluded by the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise KKR from its 2026 IPL squad.The International Cricket Council later confirmed that Scotland would replace Bangladesh in the tournament, saying the “difficult decision” was taken as it was not possible to accommodate the BCB’s request to move its matches to Sri Lanka so close to the event.The ICC also said there was no verifiable security threat to Bangladesh players, officials or fans in India and that changing the tournament schedule was not appropriate.","Bangladesh government clears its shooting team to travel to India for Asian Rifle and Pistol Championships.

NEW DELHI: Former Australia all-rounder Jason Gillespie has been named head coach of the new Hyderabad franchise in the Pakistan Super League . The 50-year-old will return to Pakistan cricket in a new role after a turbulent exit from the national setup in December 2024.Gillespie will build the Hyderabad squad from scratch at the PSL auction on February 11. He will then guide the team in the 2026 season, which begins on March 26. Hyderabad are one of two new franchises added for the upcoming season, along with a Sialkot-based team.This marks Gillespie’s first involvement in Pakistan cricket since he resigned as head coach of the Pakistan Test team just days before the South Africa series in December 2024.His sudden exit raised eyebrows at the time and led to several public statements from the former fast bowler.Reacting to his new role, Gillespie shared his excitement on social media. “Beyond excited to be part of the @KingsmenCricket family. So looking forward to being part of the Hyderabad team!” he wrote on X.However, Gillespie’s return comes after he accused the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) of not clearing some of his dues.He said he was still waiting for payment for work done during his time as Pakistan’s red-ball coach.“Yeah, without going into the details, obviously still waiting on some remuneration from work that has been done… Admittedly, that has been a little bit disappointing but look, hopefully that can get sorted sooner rather than later,” Gillespie posted on Instagram.The PCB strongly denied the claims and released a statement in response.“The Pakistan Cricket Board refutes claims made by a former head coach on the non-payment of his dues,” the PCB spokesperson said, adding that Gillespie left without serving a four-month notice period.Earlier, Gillespie had explained why he resigned from his Pakistan role. He said the removal of high-performance coach Tim Nielsen was a major factor.“I was completely and utterly blindsided by a decision to not have a high-performance coach,” Gillespie told ABC Sport, adding that poor communication made his role difficult.","Jason Gillespie named head coach of new Hyderabad franchise in the Pakistan Super League.

After taking key wickets against India in the fourth T20I, in Vishakhapatnam, left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner said his job in T20Is is to bowl defensively, build pressure, and take wickets. He said it was good to see the plan work in the match.Mitchell Santner took 3 wickets for 26 runs as New Zealand beat India by 50 runs at the ACA-VDCA Stadium.""I guess my role might be playing a little bit more defensive and trying to get wickets that way. At times you want to be smart, six singles are a good option. We've seen a lot of power hitting, a lot of big scores. So, I think the role as a spinner (in T20Is), unless there is spin, is to build pressure and get wickets that way,"" said Santner in the post-match press conference.""If you're defending a big score, then let the run rate go up. And if it's a lower score, the only way we stop these guys is getting wickets. So, I think, yeah, it's all about adapting and seeing what's on the table,"" he added.Santner said that the early wicket of in-form Abhishek Sharma helped New Zealand put pressure on India.Sharma was dismissed for a golden duck (out for 0 on the first ball) in the fourth T20I against New Zealand.""I think in the other games, the guys were flying. Abhishek, you know, it doesn't get any harder than that.And that's why I told the bowlers, that's as hard as it gets. So, it was nice to bounce back,"" he said.Santner explained his plan, pointing to his dismissal of Hardik Pandya . He said he changed the flight, and Pandya edged the ball to Zak Foulkes near the circle.""I've bowled a lot to Hardik in the Mumbai (Indians) nets and he knows me, I know him. So, I think in that situation, that (being defensive) was the only way we're going to kind of win that game because it's pretty tough to stop the Indian team when they're going,"" he added.The New Zealand captain praised Dube for his quick 65 off 23 balls""I've seen him (Dube) do that a lot and he hits it very far. But we knew that if we could get him out, they didn't bat as deep as they have in other games. They had Harshit at seven. But I think Dube is very clear in what he wants to do. When the spinner comes on, he knows that that's a good match-up for him.""Although India won the series, Santner said the experience of playing different situations in the ODIs and T20Is against the hosts will help New Zealand in next month’s T20 World Cup.""I said that at the start of the series, there's no better prep than playing India in India before the World Cup. Regardless of the result, we were tested a lot in the first few games. But, again, it's learning, it's putting guys in roles to perform.""If we come up against India at some stage or even, you know, the wickets, like we're most likely to get in the World Cup...when you do come up against those pressure situations, again, you can be clear.""",Mitchell Santner took 3 wickets for 26 runs as New Zealand beat India by 50 runs at the ACA-VDCA Stadium.

A bold prediction for Mike Evans

Does Mike Evans still want to win a title?

Mike Evans has been one of the faces of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for more than a decade. From Super Bowl glory to record-breaking consistency, the veteran wide receiver has spent his entire NFL career in Tampa Bay. But as the 2026 offseason approaches, uncertainty is finally creeping in around his future.He is set to become a free agent, and while many believe he will either re-sign with the Buccaneers or retire, one analyst has floated a surprising alternative: a move to an NFC rival. Fantasy Pros analyst Frank Ammirante recently predicted that Evans could leave Tampa Bay and sign with the Carolina Panthers. The idea has caught attention largely because of Evans’ long-standing connection with Panthers head coach Dave Canales, who previously worked as Tampa Bay’s offensive coordinator.During their lone season together in 2023 he finished with 79 receptions, 1,255 yards and 13 touchdowns. That familiarity, Ammirante argues could make Carolina a realistic landing spot if Evans decides to move on.The Panthers are also actively looking to build around young quarterback Bryce Young, and adding a proven, physical receiver like Evans could instantly raise the level of the offense.From a football perspective, the fit is easy to understand.Carolina lacks a true veteran No. 1 wide receiver, and pairing Evans with rookie standout Tetairoa McMillan would give the Panthers two big-bodied targets on the outside. That kind of setup could help Young with contested catches, red-zone efficiency, and overall confidence.His size, experience, and route-running remain valuable even at 32. Despite injury setbacks in recent seasons, he is still viewed around the league as a reliable playmaker when healthy.While the Panthers scenario sounds logical on paper, it also raises a key question: does Evans want to spend the final years of his career on a rebuilding team?Evans already has a Super Bowl ring and has repeatedly spoken about wanting to compete at the highest level. At the moment, Tampa Bay still offers a clearer path to contention than Carolina, which is in the early stages of a rebuild.That is why many around the league still believe Evans will return to the Buccaneers, especially if the team is willing to meet his contract expectations. Tampa Bay’s coaching staff has made it clear they value Evans, and it is hard to imagine the franchise letting its all-time receiving leader walk away easily. If the Buccaneers bring him back, Evans could finish his career with the team that drafted him, a rare achievement in today’s NFL.","Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans is set to become a free agent in 2026.

“I’d have a statue with Grizzlies by now”: Jayson Tatum explains why Boston’s standard makes greatness feel ordinary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/id-have-a-statue-with-grizzlies-by-now-jayson-tatum-explains-why-bostons-standard-makes-greatness-feel-ordinary/articleshow/127709590.cms,"Jayson Ttaum (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)

Jayson Tatum says Grizzlies would have erected a statue in his honor

Navigating the $314 million extension

For Jayson Tatum, it seems like there’s winning in the NBA, and then there is winning in Boston. This distinction has become the defining theme of his professional life. The Celtics’ cornerstone opened up about the unique, often sky-high expectations that come with playing as a Celtic.Jayson’s contribution in bringing home the 2024 NBA championship is irrefutable. In Celtics vs Mavs decisive Game 5, Tatum recorded 31 points, 11 assists, and 8 rebounds, and went 11-24 from the field with an efficiency of 45.8%. But despite these illustrious stats on his resume, Tatum believes that Boston’s weight of 18 banners changes the way a player's career is perceived.During a conversation on that latest episode of The Pivot Podcast with Ryan Clark, Channing Crowder, and Fred Taylor, Jayson Tatum opened about the expectations while playing for the City of Champions, drawing a stark comparison between the historical prestige of Boston and the reality of smaller NBA markets.“Let’s be honest, the career I have right now, if I had it with the Grizzlies, I would have a statue outside the arena right now. I am chasing like Larry Bird, where the standard is so much higher, and you don’t want to be the great Celtics players who didn’t win,” Tatum remarked.Tatum, currently 27 and working his way back from a significant Achilles injury sustained in the 2025 playoffs, already boasts a resume that includes an NBA Championship, multiple All-NBA First Team selections, and two Olympic gold medals.But his comment highlights a fascinating disparity in NBA culture.For a franchise like the Memphis Grizzlies, a team that is still searching for its first title, Jayson’s excellence on the court as per would lead to immediate immortalization. However, in Boston, Tatum finds himself measured against the likes of Larry Bird, Bill Russell, and Paul Pierce. For the Celtics fans, a single ring is often viewed as the entry fee to the conversation of greatness, rather than the conclusion of it.As per Spotrac, in July 2024, Jayson Tatum signed the largest contract in NBA history, a five-year, $314 million supermax extension. Under this contract, he’ll earn $54.1 million in 2025-26 and then a staggering $71 million in the final year of the contract. However, the 2025-26 campaign has been sidelined because of a torn right Achilles suffered in last year's playoffs.Now eight months post-surgery, Tatum continues to tease fans with explosive workout videos, but the franchise hasn’t set any date for his potential return. The Celtics (29-17) are currently sitting second in the East, and despite the absence of Tatum on the hardwood, they boast the second-best offensive rating with 120.8.","Jayson Tatum says Memphis Grizzlies would have erected a statue in his honor.

Tensions boil between Jeremiah Feas and Lu Dort at the buzzer

Thunder secured a win, whereas Pelicans face another loss

A hard-fought contest between the New Orleans Pelicans and the Oklahoma City Thunder ended in chaos on Tuesday night as rookie guard Jeremiah Fears had to be physically restrained and escorted from the floor after a scuffle with Thunder guard Lu Dort. The incident occurred at the final buzzer of the Thunder’s 104-95 victory at the Paycom Center, turning a standard regular-season matchup into a heated bench-clearing altercation.This was Fears’ 48th game of the season and first official on-court fight after being selected as the 7th overall pick by the New Orleans Pelicans in the 2025 NBA draft.In the final seconds of Pelican vs Thunder, Fears wanted to attempt the last layup but was closely guarded by Lu Dort. This physical contest led to an immediate verbal exchange and then escalated rapidly as both players grabbed each other's jerseys, prompting teammates, coaches, and security personnel to rush the court to separate the pair.The 19-year-old Fears, visibly fuming, had to be held back by multiple staff members as he continued to pursue Dort across the hardwood. Luckily, the entire scene happened after the final horn, therefore, the officials did not assess any technical fouls.But both are expected to face some disciplinary action after the league reviews the footage.Andrew Schlecht of The Athletic asked Oklahoma’s head coach about the altercation between OKC and New Orleans after the final buzzer, to which Mark Daigneault answered with, “Good guys. Good crew. But I thought they lost control of the game in the final minutes. I thought that altercation at the end started well before that with the Bey and J-Will situation. I thought they could’ve managed that cleaner.Daigneault added, “And then the second thing is I think that’s a foul on Dort. And if it was, they should put a whistle on that play regardless of the score and the time. If they do that, everybody stops playing, and you can legislate the situation as you normally would.”The reigning NBA champions extended their record to 38-10 and their first win after back-to-back losses against the Pacers and Raptors. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander anchored the victory with 29 points and stabilised the Thunder’s dominance atop the Western Conference.For the Pelicans, this was their 37th loss of the season, with only 12 wins. Fears contributed 7 points, but Zion Williamson led with a double-double of 21 points and 11 rebounds. While the night ended with animosity, the focus for both teams now shifts to the league's upcoming schedule, with New Orleans returning home to face Memphis and the Thunder looking to build on this momentum.",Oklahoma City Thunder beat New Orleans Pelicans 104-95 on Tuesday night.

Allen Iverson’s silent departure sparks fans' outrage



NBL veteran Jason Cadee calls out Allen Iverson



Basketball fans across Australia are burning with disappointment after NBA legend Allen Iverson’s highly anticipated promotional tour was scrapped at the eleventh hour. The Hall of Famer was visiting Australia for two events, first The Allen Iverson Experience 2026 and second the HoopsFest Perth, a major NBL festival.The 11-NBA All-Star was scheduled to appear at several high-profile events across Perth, Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, promising fans a rare opportunity to engage with one of the most influential figures in sports history. However, the sudden collapse of the tour has left ticket holders in a lurch and fueled their disappointment over the NBA MVP’s “no-show.”On January 22, Allen Iverson was to appear at a meet-and-greet in Melbourne, an event which was organised with Challenge-Supporting Kids with Cancer, a not-for-profit group. The event saw thousands of fans turning up to meet the NBA star.Despite the promised personal interaction, photos, and signing, all the fans got was an unenthusiastic Iverson after he spend 2-hours locked in his room. He refused to speak with the kids and told the families he was having “a bad day.”A fan via Reddit shared, “Allen Iverson came to Cavalo Prestige Melbourne to meet 12 kids who are battling cancer. My little brother, who is 12 years old and currently receiving chemotherapy for ALCL lymphoma, was so excited to meet one of his idols.He came out extremely disgusted and disappointed in Allen Iverson’s behaviour - and so were the other families.”The frustration peaked the next day when fans arrived at scheduled venues only to find empty seats and canceled notices as Iverson didn’t show up at all. The situation gained significant traction on social media, particularly after a fans posted about their long-distance journey and big bucks spent for a mere glimpse of the superstar.Jason Cadee via his podcast, Cut to the Jase, called out the NBA superstar and criticised his unprofessional behaviour. He said, “I landed Thursday (at HoopsFest) and by the time I landed, I had already heard how difficult he was being and how much of a shit show it was. Late to stuff, barely spoke, first interview they asked him how Australia was or something and he just laughed and said ‘I haven’t left my room’. Just things where I’m like ‘why would you come’ if you’re going to be like this. ”For the Australian basketball community, Iverson’s visit was to boost the local basketball programs, but instead, fans are now being directed to point-of-sale platforms to process their returns. Whether Iverson will eventually make his way Down Under to fulfill the promises made to his international fanbase remains unclear.","Allen Iverson’s highly anticipated promotional tour was scrapped at the eleventh hour.

Duran tops MLB network's 2026 left fielder rankings

Fan reactions and the controversial context

Fans and analysts alike were surprised this week when MLB Network ranked Boston Red Sox outfielder Jarren Duran as the No. 1 outfielder in Major League Baseball right now, in its annual ""Top 10 Left Fielders"", released January 27. The ranking, which was included as part of MLB Network's preseason positional rollouts, put Duran above established stars such as Cody Bellinger and Riley Greene, sparking debate on how talent is assessed and how deep the talent pool is at each position around the league.MLB Network's annual rankings, put together by the network's research team using a combination of traditional stats and advanced metrics, named Jarren Duran of the Red Sox as the No. 1 left fielder heading into the 2026 season on January 27. However, this ranking has caused a ripple effect amongst the fans and analysts questioning the positioning. Duran secured the top spot on the list after a productive 2025 campaign, hitting 159 hits and 16 home runs as a left fielder. His offensive contributions, including solid contact and power numbers, propel him to the top of the list ahead of other players on the list, including former MLB MVP winners and perennial outfield standouts.Cody Bellinger, fresh from a 29-home run season with the New York Yankees, stood at number 3, while Riley Greene of the Detroit Tigers ranked fourth. The positioning of some established defenders and producers outside of the top spots has raised controversy among fans, fuelling debate over the depth and strength of the left field talent despite Duran's emergence to the top.The announcement stirred reactions on social media platforms, with some fans questioning how a player such as Duran could be ranked above other perennial favorites or players with longer track records at the position. Critics cited left fielders such as Steven Kwan, who is a multiple-time Gold Glove winner, not making MLB Network's top 10, with some questioning whether the lists are too dependent on certain metrics or recent performance over reputation.On the other hand, Duran’s supporters countered that his consistency, versatility, and ability to both hit and play outstanding defense have made him a viable candidate for the top slot, particularly as teams are preparing for spring training and the 2026 season. With the positional rankings coming into play for the forthcoming weeks, all eyes will be on how the other outfielders play and whether or not these pre-season lists will reflect on-field results when the new season kicks off.","MLB Network ranked Boston Red Sox outfielder Jarren Duran as the No. 1 left fielder heading into the 2026 season on January 27.

Top contenders emerging in Giannis Antetokounmpo trade talks as Bucks listen to offers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/top-contenders-emerging-in-giannis-antetokounmpo-trade-talks-as-bucks-listen-to-offers/articleshow/127731173.cms,"Giannis Antetokounmpo.

Why this matters: Giannis Antetokounmpo could actually get traded for the first time

Who's pushing hardest for Giannis?

Something huge just dropped in the NBA world, two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo is reportedly ready for a new home and the Milwaukee Bucks are actually listening to trade offers either at the Feb. 5 trade deadline or in the offseason.After more than a decade in Milwaukee, the Greek Freak’s future with the Bucks has become the biggest story in the league, with teams throwing aggressive offers into the mix.Giannis has been the face of the Bucks since 2013, leading them to a championship and multiple MVPs. But things haven’t clicked this season, Milwaukee is struggling with an 18-27 record and currently outside the playoff picture, fueling serious questions about the franchise’s direction.According to sources, Giannis believes the moment has come to move on after 12+ years with the Bucks and while the team used to shut down trade talk, they’re now open to offers.If this actually happens, it would be one of the biggest trades in NBA history, a generational superstar switching uniforms right before the postseason. Giants really move in silence… until now.But while the Bucks are “listening,” they’re not desperate to dump Giannis.They’ve told interested teams they want a massive haul like blue-chip young talent + a stash of draft picks.In other words: they’d rather wait for a summer blockbuster situation than settle for mediocre return packages at the deadline. That’s pressure on every contender right now.League whispers say multiple franchises are champing at the bit to make a move before Feb. 5 especially the Miami Heat, Golden State Warriors, and Toronto Raptors, all reportedly “pushing hard” to get a deal done.There’s also chatter about the New York Knicks being a dream landing spot for Giannis, dating back to offseason rumors, though logistics like cap space and draft assets make that tricky at the deadline.Real talk, a deadline deal might happen but many insiders think this saga could stretch into the offseason if the Bucks don’t get the package they want.Either way, this trade story is now NBA-wide watercooler talk: if Giannis gets moved, it would reshape title races, rebuilds, and franchise futures across the league.Stay tuned, this World Cup-style drama is just getting started.","Giannis Antetokounmpo's future with the Milwaukee Bucks has become the biggest story in the league.

Patriots fan gifted Super Bowl tickets by Robert Kraft dies after cancer battle

“When I’m here, I don’t think about cancer, I watch the Patriots.”

It’s a heart-wrenching story from the Patriots world right now. Shelly Sepulveda, a devoted New England Patriots fan and former neonatal ICU nurse, has passed away after a two-year battle with ovarian cancer just weeks after Patriots owner Robert Kraft and his wife surprised her with Super Bowl LX tickets.Shelly died on January 26, 2026, only hours after the Patriots secured their spot in Super Bowl LX with a win over the Broncos. Her journey was one of strength, love, and real fandom and the Krafts’ gesture gave her one of her happiest moments during a really tough fight.Earlier this month, after the Patriots’ Wild Card win, Robert Kraft and Dr. Dana Kraft surprised Shelly on the field with Super Bowl tickets, a moment she visibly lost it over in a video shared by the team. Shelly told Kraft something really telling:That line sums up what football meant to her during her illness.Shelly wasn’t just a fan, she was a 42-year-old mother of six, a wife to Tami Sepulveda, and someone who gave back hard. She and Tami had adopted five kids and fostered more than 20 children, especially those affected by substance abuse. That’s a life dedicated to love and care, not just cheering on Sundays.Diagnosed with stage 3 ovarian cancer in 2024, she fought hard for her family while sharing her journey publicly and honestly.Shelly was hospitalized in mid-January with low blood counts, but moments earlier she had been filled with pride and joy after getting the Super Bowl tickets. She passed away just hours after the Patriots punched their ticket to the Super Bowl, a timing that’s hit many fans right in the feels.Tami Sepulveda posted a tribute saying Shelly “tried as hard as she could to stay here” and called her the best wife, mother, and friend. A GoFundMe to help with funeral and memorial costs has raised tens of thousands in support from people touched by her story.This isn’t just about a fan dying, it’s about someone who lived with purpose and used her love of football as a source of joy and strength through the hardest days. Stories like this hit differently because they remind us that behind every fan moment is a real human life with love, pain, and memories that matter.","Shelly Sepulveda, a devoted New England Patriots fan and former neonatal ICU nurse, has passed away after a two-year battle with ovarian cancer.

Los Angeles Lakers vs Cleveland Cavaliers Expectations and stakes

Thego into Wednesday night’s game in Cleveland knowing their top player will be available.and does not appear on the injury report ahead of the matchup at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.That matters for a Lakers team already short-handed. With injuries thinning the rotation, the offense will again run through Doncic and LeBron James as the Lakers try to keep pace in a crowded Western Conference race.There is no injury designation next to Luka Doncic’s name. He is not listed as questionable or doubtful and is expected to be in the starting lineup when the Lakers face the Cleveland Cavaliers.The Lakers’ injury report focuses elsewhere. Austin Reaves remains out with a calf injury, and rookie Adou Thiero is sidelined with an MCL sprain. With both unavailable, Doncic’s role becomes even larger on both ends of the floor.Doncic enters the game without any new health concerns. Over his last 10 games, he has averaged more than 30 points per night, along with roughly seven to eight rebounds and close to nine assists.His minutes reflect how much the Lakers rely on him. He is regularly playing between 37 and 40 minutes, handling the ball late and creating most of the team’s offense.That workload showed in the previous game against Chicago, when Doncic finished with 46 points, 12 assists, and seven rebounds.Cleveland will also be missing key players. Evan Mobley is out with a calf injury, and Darius Garland remains sidelined due to a toe issue. Those absences affect both rim protection and backcourt defense.With Cleveland leaning more heavily on Donovan Mitchell to carry the offense, the Lakers are expected to put the ball in Doncic’s hands early and often. Pick-and-roll actions and isolation sets should be a major part of the game plan.Betting lines reflect full confidence that Luka Doncic will play, with scoring projections around the mid-30s and rebound numbers set near eight.

Patrick Reed confirms LIV Golf exit and outlines PGA Tour and DP World Tour return plan

Patrick Reed has officially walked away from LIV Golf, sending shockwaves through the Saudi-backed league. The 2018 Masters winner confirmed his exit on Wednesday, just weeks after Brooks Koepka also left LIV Golf to return to the PGA Tour. This marks another major setback for the breakaway tour, which is already under pressure. Reed had hinted at this move last weekend. He revealed that his contract with LIV Golf had ended and said there was no promise he would sign a new deal before the 2026 season began. Now, that hint has turned into a clear decision.The American golfer will not return to the PGA Tour right away as a full member. However, the PGA Tour has confirmed that Patrick Reed will be allowed to play as a non-member starting in August 2026. His full return as a past champion member is set for the 2027 season. In the meantime, Reed plans to play on the DP World Tour after winning the Dubai Desert Classic on Sunday. This move follows Brooks Koepka’s recent return and raises fresh questions about LIV Golf’s future and its ability to keep top players.Patrick Reed joined LIV Golf in 2022 but has now decided to move on. In a clear statement, he explained why he is leaving and what comes next.“After careful thought and consideration, my family and I have decided that I will no longer compete on the LIV Golf Tour,” Reed said.He confirmed his long-term plan to return to the PGA Tour, adding, “I am excited to announce that I am returning to the PGA Tour as a past champion member for the 2027 season and am eligible to begin competing in PGA Tour events later this year.”Reed also shared his connection to traditional golf, saying, “I’m a traditionalist at heart, and I was born to play on the PGA TOUR, which is where my story began with my wife, Justine.”While waiting for his PGA return, Reed will play on the DP World Tour. He said, “I will continue to compete and play as an honorary lifetime member on the DP World Tour, which is something that I am truly honored and excited to do.”Reed thanked LIV Golf before leaving. “To Dustin Johnson, The Aces, and LIV Golf, I want to thank you for the memories we shared and created together,” he said.The PGA Tour also confirmed his status in a statement: “Patrick Reed has informed the PGA Tour of his desire to return. A nine-time PGA Tour winner, he is seeking reinstatement of his PGA Tour membership for the 2027 season.”The tour added that Reed can compete as a non-member from August 25, 2026, according to the PGA Tour.LIV Golf, however, takes another hit.

NEW DELHI: An Equestrian Federation of India (EFI) executive committee member accused of sexually harassing two women students has travelled with the Indian contingent to the International Tent Pegging World Cup qualifiers in Jordan, prompting the sport’s global governing body to write to their Indian counterparts asking how an official charged of molestation by police authorities could have accompanied the team.The Oman-based International Tent Pegging Federation (ITPF) has strongly objected to the presence of Colonel (retd) Tarsem Singh Warraich, EC member (Tent Pegging) at the WC qualifiers, after a parent of a junior category girl rider wrote to the world body fearing for the safety and well-being of her daughter as well as other female equestrian athletes.Warraich, who is out on bail on the condition that his sister-in-law is suffering from cancer and requires his presence for chemotherapy, has travelled with the four-member team (including two girls) as manager-cum-coach, despite objections from some other EFI members. “He bullied his way into accompanying the team. Some of the EFI’s EC members backed him to travel for the qualifiers,” sources told TOI.“I wasn’t consulted on team selection. I was kept in the dark. I had no role in the selection process or the choice of Mr Tarsem’s appointment as manager-cum-coach. EFI’s EC would better explain this matter. Also, no trials happened,” EFI’s secretary general, Col (retd) Jaiveer Singh said.It has been learnt that the team was sent by the federation without conducting any selection trials. Apparently, riding clubs in Delhi and Haryana were not available for trials due to prior bookings. The qualifiers, which will take place from Jan 29-31, will be contested between India, Algeria, Germany, Indonesia, Kuwait, Norway and Saudi Arabia. The Tent Pegging WC is scheduled for Nov also in Jordan.According to the documents available with TOI, Warraich was booked under sections 323 (voluntary causing hurt), 354A (sexual harassment and unwelcome physical contact), 376 (punishment for rape) and 511 (assaulting or using criminal force to outrage a woman’s modesty) by the police station authorities at Sector 27, Sonipat for sexually harassing two women students on the Jindal Global University (JGU) campus, when the EFI EC member was teaching there in Feb, 2023. An FIR was immediately filed against Warraich on the complaint of women students (who belonged to the Army families), and he was subsequently arrested and jailed.Warraich was later granted bail by a fast track court of Additional Sessions judge, Justice Dr Jasbir Singh, on the strict condition that the accused will be attending to his ailing sister-in-law and will remain present in India (a copy of the court order is available with TOI). The interim bail was granted until March 12, 2026, after which Warraich was instructed to surrender.However, Warraich travelled with the team to the Jordan WC qualifiers, much to the annoyance of some of the parents of girls’ riders.One of the parents wrote to the ITPF: “I’m writing to you as the father of a girl who is competing in the junior category in equestrian. It has been noticed that Col Tarsem Singh, who is presently on bail for a sexual harassment offence is representing the country as a coach for the Indian tent pegging team which will be competing in World Cup qualifiers. I’m deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of my daughter as well as other girl riders of the country when due to the infighting amongst the officials of the federation the state of affairs in the national federation has gone so low that we have an individual who is on bail for a sexual crime will be representing the country as a coach”.Upon receiving the complaint, the ITPF shot off a letter to the EFI, demanding explanation and immediate action into the case. “The complaint contains serious concerns related to the safety and well being of athletes. We request that this issue be treated with the utmost seriousness, and that appropriate action be taken after due verification of the information provided,” wrote the secretariat of the ITPF.","Colonel (retd) Tarsem Singh Warraich, EC member (Tent Pegging), is accused of sexually harassing two women students.

Nebra Sky Disc found on Mittelberg Hill reveals ancient star map



How the Nebra Sky disc changed over time



Some discoveries make you stop and stare. The Nebra Sky Disc is one of them. Unearthed in Germany, this 3,800-year-old bronze disc seems simple at first glance. A bronze circle. Gold inlays. Stars and moons. But experts say it could be the world’s oldest “astronomy app.” People back in the Bronze Age might have used it to read the sky, track seasons, maybe even plan rituals. It’s mind-blowing to think that nearly 4,000 years ago, humans were looking at the stars in ways that resemble our modern obsession with apps and tech.The disc itself is small. Yet, it packs a huge story. It hints at early Europeans’ understanding of the cosmos, long before written astronomy. Archaeologists are still teasing apart its mysteries. Every mark seems to have a purpose. Some stars might represent the Pleiades cluster. Others hint at solstices.The disc was discovered on Mittelberg Hill, near Nebra in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, in 1999. Treasure hunters reportedly dug it up illegally. Alongside swords, axes, and bracelets. Police recovered it. Archaeologists swooped in. Carbon dating suggests it was made between 1800 and 1600 B.C.It seems the disc wasn’t just lying around. Its placement, near a hill and open sky, might have mattered. Maybe it was used outside. Experts speculate it was part practical tool, part spiritual object. Made of bronze, inlaid with gold, the disc shows a crescent moon, a full moon or sun, and 32 stars. Seven of these stars appear to mimic the Pleiades. Some researchers think it acted as a celestial calendar. Tracking solstices. Guiding farmers on when to sow and harvest.The craftsmanship is striking. Tiny gold pieces, carefully placed. Not random. People back then clearly understood what they were doing. It’s easy to assume ancient people didn’t think like us. But this disc suggests otherwise. They observed, calculated, and recorded.Studies show the disc evolved over time. Initially, the moon and stars were the main focus. Then gold arcs were added, which experts think mark horizons at the summer and winter solstices. A third golden arc appeared later, perhaps a solar boat. One more phase added holes around the edge, maybe for mounting it during ceremonies.It seems every generation added something new. A cosmic tool that grew with knowledge. You can almost imagine ancient people holding it up, aligning it with the sun and stars. Feeling the power in understanding the sky. The disc wasn’t just practical. It likely symbolised power. Maybe owned by a chieftain or priest. Understanding the heavens gave authority. And using precious metals made it look important. Not just decorative. Sacred, perhaps.Alignment with nearby mountains adds to the intrigue. When set just right, the arcs line up with sunsets at solstices. Imagine Bronze Age people watching this happen, year after year. Tracking the sun, the stars, life itself.The Nebra Sky Disc connects science, myth, and human curiosity. Nearly 4,000 years later, it still inspires awe. Not just a piece of metal. A window into minds that looked up at the sky and wondered. That might be the first “app” humans ever made. Ancient tech, in its purest, starlit form.","Nebra Sky Disc found on Mittelberg Hill reveals ancient star map.

Dubai Police are taking community engagement to a new level by inviting UAE residents to capture the action at the upcoming UAE SWAT Challenge and win cash prizes. The move aims to blend high-adrenaline tactical competition with digital creativity and public participation. The announcement has quickly become one of the most talked-about local developments, especially among students, content creators and social media users across the Emirates.As a part of a new initiative called the SWAT Clip Award, Dubai Police will offer up to Dh30,000 (about $10,000) for the best short video made by residents during the event, which runs from February 7 to 11 at the Al Ruwayyah training grounds.The UAE SWAT Challenge is a high-profile international tactical competition organised by the Dubai Police General Command. Now in its seventh edition, this event attracts elite special tactical teams from around the world to compete across demanding scenarios, from assault and obstacle courses to officer rescue and tower challenges, testing teamwork, strategy and endurance.This year’s event has already drawn 114 teams from 48 countries, making it the largest edition yet and reflecting Dubai’s growing role as a global hub for police excellence and security cooperation.Unlike typical spectator events, the SWAT Clip Award is designed specifically to bring the community inside the action. Participants, especially students, are encouraged to submit 30- to 60-second creative videos showing anything from teamwork and tactical skills to cultural diversity and human values displayed during the challenge.Under the SWAT Clip Award -Additional cash rewards of up to Dh30,000 in total are on offer for the most compelling and well-crafted entries, making it a rare opportunity for residents to earn money while capturing a world-class event. Entrants must follow guidelines such as shooting in portrait mode (vertical), adhering to safety instructions at the venue and ensuring that content reflects the spirit of teamwork, discipline and fair competition. Drones are not allowed unless officially authorised.Officials say the competition is part of a broader strategy to foster closer ties between the police and the UAE community, especially young people who are active on platforms like Instagram, TikTok and YouTube. Brigadier Ali Al Mansouri, Director of the General Department of Community Happiness at Dubai Police, emphasized the SWAT Clip initiative’s goal of showcasing the professionalism of participating teams as well as “the human values that define the competition. ”By inviting residents to document the event, Dubai Police are tapping into a vibrant culture of mobile content creation, where authentic, resident-generated videos can boost awareness, pride and engagement far beyond traditional media coverage. This also enables the public to see elite policing in action and celebrate the discipline, courage and coordination that define special units.The UAE SWAT Challenge has a strong track record of global involvement. In 2025, it broke Guinness World Records for the number of participating nations and teams, underlining its reputation as one of the world’s most ambitious tactical competitions. The event combines practical tactical tests such as obstacle courses, hostage rescue simulations and tower challenges with opportunities for expert exchange between international police forces.Dubai Police also places a premium on professional benchmarking, with teams earning points across daily challenges leading to an overall champion trophy. By adding a public-facing video contest, organisers are broadening the appeal of the event beyond law enforcement circles to include students, creators, families and digital audiences. The initiative reflects how major sporting and tactical events can be amplified through community participation and social media storytelling.The response on social platforms has been enthusiastic, particularly among university students and young creators who see the SWAT Clip Award as a chance to combine creativity with real-world excitement. Many residents have already shared tips on filming mobile footage at large events, while social media groups are buzzing with suggestions on the best ways to capture striking angles, teamwork highlights and candid moments between competition heats.The reward has motivated some to plan storyboards, scout locations at the venue and prepare editing styles that underscore discipline, spirit and tactical precision. Overall, the challenge and its accompanying video contest are already shaping up to be a highlight of the UAE’s February event calendar, drawing not just elite police teams but also a growing network of creative residents and digital storytellers.The SWAT Clip Award demonstrates how law enforcement events can evolve into community-driven cultural moments, blending professional competition with creative expression. With cash prizes, international participation and high visibility, this initiative could set a precedent for how security agencies worldwide engage with the public in an increasingly interconnected digital landscape.As Dubai Police gear up for the event from February 7 to 11, residents and visitors alike are preparing to capture the action, tell their stories and potentially walk away with Dh30,000 in pocket, turning tactical excellence into public celebration and digital creativity.","Dubai Police offer residents up to Dh30,000 for best video at UAE SWAT Challenge.

What do these giant dinosaur footprints reveal about prehistoric life

Why this dinosaur footprint discovery is so important





Researchers have found some of the biggest dinosaur footprints ever. They are so huge that an adult could curl up inside one without a problem. It’s wild to imagine, honestly. This kind of find really turns our old ideas about prehistoric life on its head.This ancient print was uncovered along the Dampier Peninsula in Western Australia and is given the title of “ Largest dinosaur footprint ” by Guinness World Records. They are embedded in fossil-rich sandstone that dates to the Early Cretaceous, which was roughly 130 million years ago.The site stands out because the prints aren’t just massive; they’re deep and come in all kinds of shapes, showing off the variety of dinosaurs that wandered through this part of northwest Australia. It’s more than just proof of some truly gigantic creatures. These tracks give us a real peek into the world of Gondwana, the ancient southern supercontinent that once included Australia.A sauropod footprint that’s about 1.7 meters long, so just over 5 and a half feet, was found in this site. That’s the largest dinosaur footprint anyone’s ever found. Researchers from the University of Queensland and James Cook University matched these giant tracks to sauropods, those long-necked, plant-munching giants that once roamed the Earth.A vertebrate palaeontologist at the University of Queensland put it simply: some tracks here are so huge, most people could actually fit inside one. The dinosaurs that left them probably stood about 5.3 to 5.5 meters tall at the hip. Even for dinosaurs, that’s seriously massive.These footprints sit in what people now like to call Australia’s own Jurassic Park. Along the coast where the Broome Sandstone stretches out, scientists have found over 150 tracks from at least 21 different kinds of dinosaurs. We’re talking big meat-eaters like theropods, two-legged plant-eaters called ornithopods, armoured dinosaurs known as thyreophorans, and quite a few sauropods too.This makes the site one of the most varied dinosaur tracksites you’ll find anywhere, and it gives Australia some of its best proof of dinosaur life from the Early Cretaceous.The Broome Sandstone itself is seriously ancient. It started as river delta mud and sand, then, ages later, it showed up along today’s shoreline. What’s really cool is that a lot of these tracks sit out in the intertidal zone. They only appear when the tide’s out, so the timing has to be just right. It’s this odd bit of geology that’s turned the place into a goldmine for palaeontologists.For the first time in Australia, researchers have found confirmed stegosaur footprints. Evidence that these dinosaurs once roamed here, even though nobody had spotted them in the fossil record before.These tracks back up earlier discoveries highlighted by National Geographic , which pointed out how massive the Kimberley prints are and how much they reveal about dinosaur life in ancient times. And it’s not just about size. These trackways tell us how these giants moved, how they lived, and how they fit into their world. Footprints like these freeze a brief moment from the distant past, letting scientists study actual dinosaur behaviour, not just their bones.It’s wild to think about, but it really drives home just how huge and lively the ancient world was. These fossil tracks aren’t just old marks in the ground; they’re snapshots of colossal sauropods, bustling herds, and prehistoric landscapes frozen in stone. If you find yourself on the coast of Western Australia when the tide goes out, you’re literally walking over one of the greatest dinosaur stories we’ve ever uncovered.","Researchers have found some of the biggest dinosaur footprints ever.
