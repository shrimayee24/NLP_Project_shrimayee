The clip is raw, unfiltered, and packed with emotion, and fans are shook at how deep this rift might really go.In the now-viral YouTube video, Aiyuk sounded off about how the 49ers allegedly discussed trading him while he was laid up after knee surgery.The injury he‚Äôs referring to happened during the 2024 season, torn ACL, MCL, and meniscus. He had a long road back, and hearing that the front office was trying to shop him during that time clearly still stings.This isn‚Äôt a player airing casual frustration. This is a guy who felt forgotten. And he‚Äôs not staying quiet about it.Aiyuk also called out the 49ers‚Äô attempt to act like everything‚Äôs fine now. According to him, they‚Äôre trying to ‚Äúplay cool‚Äù but he‚Äôs not buying it.No sugarcoating. He‚Äôs still heated.

This isn‚Äôt about money. It‚Äôs about respect.Even after locking in long-term, Aiyuk clearly doesn‚Äôt feel like he was valued especially when he was at his most vulnerable. And from the way he‚Äôs talking, this wasn‚Äôt just a one-time miscommunication.Some fans are riding with Aiyuk for keeping it real, while others are wondering why he‚Äôs stirring the pot after getting paid. But most agree this clip just opened a whole new chapter in the 49ers locker room story.Brandon Aiyuk has said his piece and it wasn‚Äôt polished, pre-approved, or PR-friendly. It was real. And now that the smoke is out in the open, it‚Äôs up to the 49ers to either clear the air or risk this tension simmering all season long.Also read - Antonio Brown leaves country after attempted murder warrant but he can‚Äôt run forever","Brandon Aiyuk said the 49ers tried to trade him while he was recovering from a brutal knee injury.

The Boston Celtics start a busy offseason by moving Jrue Holiday for Anfernee Simons



Pros and cons of Jrue Holiday and Anfernee Simons swap



The Boston Celtics have officially traded veteran guard Jrue Holiday to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Anfernee Simons and two second-round draft picks. The deal, first reported by ESPN‚Äôs Shams Charania, marks a major shift for both franchises as they chart new paths heading into the 2025‚Äì26 NBA season. Holiday was a key part of Boston‚Äôs recent championship run, but with injuries and roster uncertainties, the team appears to be reshaping its future.Shams Charania broke the news on X, writing, ‚ÄúBREAKING: The Boston Celtics have traded Jrue Holiday to the Portland Trail Blazers for Anfernee Simons and two second-round picks, sources tell ESPN.‚Äù In a follow-up post, he elaborated: ‚ÄúPortland makes an aggressive move to re-acquire Holiday, who the franchise originally received from Milwaukee in the Damian Lillard trade in 2023 and later moved to Boston for a deal that included two first-round picks to the Blazers. Simons joins Boston on an expiring contract.‚ÄùThis marks the beginning of what could be a very active offseason for Boston. ‚ÄúAn extremely active offseason begins for the Celtics with the trade of Jrue Holiday, who played a critical role in Boston's 2024 NBA championship. The Celtics remain engaged in trade talks surrounding multiple key players on the roster, sources said,‚Äù Charania added.While Jrue Holiday brought championship pedigree, defensive grit, and veteran leadership to Boston, the team‚Äôs early exit in this year‚Äôs playoffs.Holiday, 35, is under contract for two more years, earning $32.4 million next season and $34.8 million the following year, with a $37.2 million player option for 2027‚Äì28. The Celtics opted to pivot before the aging curve became a problem. On top of that, for the Celtics‚Äô credit, they have secured two second-round picks.Anfernee Simons, meanwhile, offers youth and upside. The 26-year-old spent all seven seasons of his career with Portland and averaged 19.3 points per game last year. He is also coming off a three-year stretch where he averaged 20.7 points, 4.7 assists, shot 37.4% from three-point range, and hit 90.4% of his free throws.Though Simons‚Äô current deal is expiring, the Celtics have flexibility. If he underperforms, they walk away clean. If he flourishes, they‚Äôll be positioned to re-sign or extend a rising star. The trade also allows Boston to shed Holiday‚Äôs long-term salary commitment while betting on a player who fits their long-term timeline.For Portland, the move shows a renewed focus on defense and experience. Holiday‚Äôs championship background could serve as a stabilizing force in a young Blazers locker room.Also Read: Tyrese Haliburton breaks silence with a heartfelt message after Indiana Pacers‚Äô devastating Game 7 loss to OKC Thunder in NBA Finals While time will reveal who truly won this trade, for now, Boston has made a calculated move that balances immediate upside and future flexibility, and the league is watching closely.","The Boston Celtics have traded veteran guard Jrue Holiday to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Anfernee Simons and two second-round draft picks.

MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander cements his legacy as Oklahoma City declares a day in his name



Downtown Oklahoma City turned into a sea of blue and orange on Tuesday as thousands of fans poured into the streets to celebrate a moment more than a decade in the making ‚Äî the Thunder‚Äôs first-ever NBA championship. With the Larry O‚ÄôBrien Trophy finally in hand, players and coaches paraded through a roaring crowd, cheered on by a city beaming with pride. At the center of the celebration was none other than Finals MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, whose incredible postseason performance not only etched his name in franchise history but also earned him a citywide tribute that stunned the crowd. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander stood at the heart of it all ‚Äî shirtless, wrapped in a Canadian flag, and holding the NBA ‚Äôs ultimate prize high above his head. The 26-year-old guard had been electric throughout the playoffs, and the fans returned that energy tenfold as they celebrated with him during the Thunder‚Äôs championship parade.Across a grueling 23-game postseason run, he was nothing short of spectacular. Gilgeous-Alexander averaged 29.9 points, 6.5 assists, 5.3 rebounds, and shot nearly 88% from the free-throw line. His defining moment came in Game 7 of the NBA Finals against the Indiana Pacers , where he delivered 29 points, 12 assists, and played 40 critical minutes to lead Oklahoma City to a 104‚Äì97 win and its first-ever NBA title.But the most unforgettable moment of the parade didn‚Äôt come from the court ‚Äî it came from the stage at Scissortail Park.Amid the confetti and deafening cheers, Oklahoma City mayor David Holt took the microphone and made an announcement that instantly became part of franchise lore: July 30, 2025, will officially be recognized as Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Day.

Drafted by the Charlotte Hornets in 2018, he was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers on draft night and spent just one season there before being dealt to Oklahoma City in the 2019 blockbuster Paul George trade. Since then, he has grown into more than just a franchise player ‚Äî he‚Äôs become the face of the Thunder‚Äôs rebuild and now, its championship breakthrough.Under contract through the 2026‚Äì27 season, Gilgeous-Alexander is eligible for a four-year, $293 million supermax extension.

Gautam Gambhir Explosive Press Conference: On Drop Catches, Batting Collapse, Shubman Gill Captaincy

India Test captain Shubman Gill faced a challenging start to his leadership career as England secured a five-wicket victory in the series opener at Headingley, despite India's dominant position for most of the match. Head coach Gautam Gambhir called for patience with the young captain while praising his performance, particularly his century in the first innings.India seemed poised for their first victory at Headingley since 2002 during day four, but a second tail-end collapse and England's successful chase turned the tide against them.The match marked the beginning of a new era for India without veteran players Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, with Gill becoming India's youngest Test captain.""Look, first Test match, obviously, there are nerves. It's a great honour. As he's already mentioned, captaining the Test side, not many people get that opportunity, and he was phenomenal. More importantly, I think the way he batted in the first inning, obviously, I'm sure he would have had his own nerves, being the captain for the first time, and then getting a hundred,"" Gambhir said at the post-match press conference.""So, everything that it takes for him to be a successful captain, we've got to just give him time. We're still very early days, and he's only the captain for the first time. I'm sure he's going to get better. And these are tough places to captain. It's like pushing someone into the deep sea, and I'm sure he's going to come out as a proper professional,"" Gambhir added.Gill showcased his batting prowess in the first innings, forming a substantial 195-run partnership with vice-captain Rishabh Pant . His impressive innings of 147 runs from 227 balls ended when he hit the ball to Josh Tongue at deep square while attempting to reach his 150.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? In the second innings, Gill managed only 8 runs from 16 balls before being bowled.India's batting performance was bolstered by centuries from KL Rahul and Pant, helping the team reach a total of 364.Chasing a target of 371 runs, England's victory was secured through Ben Duckett's aggressive 149 and Joe Root's unbeaten 53, achieving their second-highest chase in Test cricket history.Despite the defeat, Gambhir remained supportive of Gill's leadership potential, emphasizing the need for time and patience as the young captain develops in his role.",England secured a five-wicket victory in the series opener at Headingley.

Poll Which part of Rishabh Pant‚Äôs performance impressed you more? His twin centuries under pressure His fearless and unique batting approach

India opener KL Rahul defended Rishabh Pant 's batting approach after the wicketkeeper-batter scored his second century of the match on Day 4 of the first Test against England at Headingley, Leeds. Pant's knock of 118 made him the first Indian wicketkeeper to score two centuries in a Test match and only the second keeper after Andy Flower to achieve this feat.Pant's innings, which came on a challenging surface, helped India set a target of 371 for England to chase on the final day. Despite playing some questionable shots early in his innings, Pant reached his century in the 70th over off Shoaib Bashir's bowling.The 27-year-old keeper-batsman's aggressive style of play has often been a subject of debate, but Rahul emphasised that there is a clear method behind Pant's approach to batting in Test cricket.""It is hard for us to understand his mindset but you let Rishabh Pant be Rishabh Pant. There is obviously a method to his madness as he is averaging 45 in Test cricket. There is a lot of thinking about the outrageous shots he plays. You just try to calm him down as much as possible between balls,"" Rahul told reporters after the day's play.The historic achievement by Pant has put India in a strong position going into the final day of the Test match.England started their chase, reaching 21/0 in six overs at stumps, with Zak Crawley showing more resilience compared to his first innings dismissal.Rahul expressed confidence about the match situation while acknowledging the challenge ahead. ""It's a blockbuster finish waiting tomorrow. At this stage of cricket I'm at, I'm a lot more calm in my head and not chasing numbers. Someone's got to win tomorrow, it'll be an interesting day,"" he said.The Karnataka-born cricketer also pointed out the deteriorating batting conditions. ""The wicket is not as easy as the first innings, they won't find it as easy to hit the ball on the rise,"" Rahul added, suggesting the target of 371 would be challenging for the home team.",Rishabh Pant is the first Indian wicketkeeper to score two centuries in a Test match.

India, however, has managed just a single victory in that same period, an unsettling statistic for a side once feared for its resilience in all conditions.The defeat at Headingley was especially bitter because India had dictated terms for much of the game. Centuries from Shubman Gill, KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant gave the visitors a hefty 371-run cushion to defend on the final day. But ‚Äògrown-up Bazball‚Äô from Ben Duckett, Zak Crawley and Joe Root turned the match on its head.

I was four and a half at the time.‚Äù Thereafter, his love for the sport led him to the 2025 NHL Draft! What happened in between? Let‚Äôs find out.When Simon‚Äôs mother found out about his love for hockey, she built an ice hockey rink for him; in fact, that‚Äôs how her rink-building company started. That is not all - she went on to purchase the Ontario Junior Hockey League team where Haoxi Wang played. Wang played ice hockey defenseman for King Rebellion of the Ontario Junior Hockey League.Wang shared with Kimelman, ‚ÄúWhen I was 10, she(Willa Wang) saw this upcoming market of hockey and the Winter Olympics in China for 2022 at the time.She gathered a few partners of her and built a new rink in Beijing. And started to own the hockey club and the figure skating club. And that‚Äôs when I have all these amazing facilities to train at, when I was a kid, and build a lot of fundamentals and fundamental skills for me when I moved to Canada. ‚ÄùIn Canada, Haoxi Wang played for the Oshawa of the Ontario Hockey League. Brad Malone, coach at Oshawa, could not stop praising Wang. He shared with Kimelman, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt teach size. You can‚Äôt teach his natural ability, his skating ability. I think his hockey IQ, both with and without the puck, is very high.He makes a lot of good decisions and a lot of really good reads. He‚Äôs a tough defender to beat. He understands the defensive side of the game.‚Äù Wang took a while to adjust to OHL, but his coach, Malone, did not see that. ‚ÄúFor me, it was right away. You saw so many good intangibles as a hockey player: his skating, his size, his stick detail, his physicality, his confidence with the puck. Just the way he carried himself.‚Äù17-year-old Haoxi ‚ÄúSimon‚Äù Wang is on the roster of 2025-2026 Boston University of the NCAA Division 1.

He‚Äôs right up there with the best skaters in the draft, and at 6-foot-5, that‚Äôs remarkable. You throw in the physicality and compete, and you have a kid who‚Äôs very intriguing to the NHL clubs. His puck game is improving, and he‚Äôs putting up some decent numbers.‚ÄùBack in October 2024, OJHL‚Äôs King Rebellion head coach Mark Joslin shared with Jim Mason of OJHL Communications, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been crazy.

"""We‚Äôre always gonna be cautious"": Dodgers manager Dave Roberts hints Shohei Ohtani may not return to full pitching form in 2025",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/were-always-gonna-be-cautious-dodgers-manager-dave-roberts-hints-shohei-ohtani-may-not-return-to-full-pitching-form-in-2025/articleshow/122055033.cms,"Image Source: Getty

Shohei Ohtani's pitching schedule will stay conservative, says Dave Roberts

Dodgers managing Ohtani‚Äôs dual role with long-term strategy in mind

The return of Shohei Ohtani to the mound has been a storyline that has been closely followed during the final stages of his recovery and his return to his level in baseball, but Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts had reins on intentions. Roberts said full build-up in the rotation this season, and perhaps the entire 2025, may never exist, even as Ohtani continues to pitch briefly this month.After Ohtani pitched one inning in his appearances against the Padres and Nationals, Roberts confirmed the Dodgers were not likely to follow a standard starter schedule for the two-way star. He was adamant that there is no finish line or a pitch count goal. Roberts added: ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre always gonna be cautious. I mean, I have no idea what it even looks like to be built up fully. I don‚Äôt think anyone knows what that looks like because it is not some ordinary starting pitcher. To say six (innings) and 90 (pitches), I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll even get to that point.‚ÄùWith Ohtani coming off a second major elbow surgery and his contributions as a designated hitter expected to be very high-value, the Dodgers are treating every inning Ohtani pitches as a bonus.The team is surviving on arms with a staggering 13 pitchers on the injured list. Instead of pushing Ohtani back into the rotation, though, they are taking a steady, thoughtful approach to maintain his overall well-being.Ohtani's unique value to the team stems from his command both on the mound and in the batter's box, which leaves the end goal of managing him far less straightforward than your average player. Roberts also acknowledged that marrying Roberts' elite hitting with the slow, careful building that continues on the pitching side of things will be crucial. Ohtani's bat is arguably the most important on the team, and with him leading the Angels in several offensive categories, it's dangerous to jeopardize that with an aggressive pitching agenda.Also Read: Shohei Ohtani touches 100 mph in electric 2025 pitching debut for Dodgers Ohtani quickly drew attention with good flashes in his two short outings (he allowed an earned run against San Diego but rebounded with a clean inning and two strikeouts against Washington). However, the hope is that he stays in short relief-type situations or as an opener. Volume is not a goal for the Dodgers, merely efficiency and durability. So, as Roberts pointed out, there is no normal for a non-normal human like Ohtani, and anything he gives you on the mound this year, or even next, is icing on the cake.","Shohei Ohtani's pitching schedule will stay conservative, says Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts.

PR crisis meets family group chat humor.

Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar has launched a scathing attack on all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja following India‚Äôs five-wicket loss against England in the first Test in Leeds.Jadeja scored 11 and an unbeaten 25 with the bat, but it was his bowling that proved to be the biggest letdown, as he managed to take only one wicket in the match.""Funnily enough, the pitch didn‚Äôt offer any lateral movement to India‚Äôs seam bowlers.

There are obvious areas of improvement, but I‚Äôm going to be critical of Jadeja because this was a final-day pitch.""There was rough for him to work with. And in the end ‚Äî yes, there were a couple of chances ‚Äî but we have to expect more from Jadeja.""These are not typical English conditions. This isn‚Äôt a pitch that offers nothing. I thought he didn‚Äôt use the rough effectively enough against Ben Stokes. He did later, but against Ben Duckett, it came very late in the innings. From experienced bowlers and against experienced batsmen, you expect more.""And somewhere, I think Jadeja was disappointing, because the seamers had nothing in the pitch for them ‚Äî but at least Jadeja had something,"" he added.","Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar has launched a scathing attack on all- rounder Ravindra Jadeja.

The Dallas Mavericks‚Äô front office, led by general manager Nico Harrison, prioritized retaining Kyrie Irving after the departure of Luka Donƒçiƒá , viewing him as a cornerstone for their next chapter. The alignment of contract timelines for Irving and Davis, along with the addition of a top rookie, positions Dallas as a contender in the Western Conference once Irving returns from injury.For Irving, the new deal and his social media message represent both a fresh start and an opportunity to further cement his legacy‚Äînot just as an elite scorer and playmaker, but as a leader capable of guiding a team through adversity.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors predicted to sign $18,001,011 Charlotte Hornets rookie to bolster squad around Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler and improve title odds Kyrie Irving‚Äôs social media message following his new contract reflects gratitude, resilience, and a clear vision for the future with the Dallas Mavericks.

Poll Do you believe India's win in the 1983 World Cup was a turning point for cricket in India? Yes, absolutely No, not really

By 1983, India already had a proud cricketing legacy and several iconic players, but they still lacked a major international trophy. One-day cricket was a relatively new format, and India‚Äîyet to don the now-famous blue kits and still playing in whites‚Äîstruggled to find their rhythm in it. Across the previous two editions of the World Cup, they had won just one out of six group-stage matches.Led by a young and spirited Kapil Dev , the 1983 squad held promise but were far from favourites. Even as they progressed steadily to the final, few gave them a real shot.Their opponents at Lord‚Äôs were the all-conquering West Indies‚Äîa side so dominant that their aura alone was enough to rattle teams. Unbeaten in both the 1975 and 1979 World Cups, the West Indies were expected to clinch their third consecutive title.Although India had stunned them once earlier in the tournament at Old Trafford, that 34-run victory was widely viewed as a fluke, especially in the face of West Indies‚Äô crushing wins that followed‚Äîby margins like 101 runs, 8 wickets, and even 10 wickets.Heading into the final, the script seemed clear: West Indies would crush India and complete a hat-trick of titles. And early in the match, it looked like that script was playing out.India, dismissed for just 183, appeared doomed.But Kapil Dev‚Äôs men believed otherwise. Sandhu removed Greenidge early, and soon the Windies found themselves five down for just 66. Kapil‚Äôs incredible running catch to dismiss Viv Richards turned the tide. Madan Lal and Amarnath cleaned up the rest.Against all odds, India sealed their place in cricketing history by being crowned world champions for the first time.",India beat West Indies in the 1983 World Cup final at Lord's.

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper‚Äôs Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline ‚ÄúPeople sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese‚Äù is technically accurate, but it doesn‚Äôt quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you‚Äôre hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper‚Äôs Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, ‚ÄúI risked my life for this. It‚Äôs my cheese. Back to back.‚Äù On the women‚Äôs side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, ‚ÄúIt felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it‚Äôs a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper‚Äôs Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

Every time I return for a season of Major League Cricket (MLC), I see progress. This is MLC Season 3, and it's already showing signs of becoming something truly special ‚Äì not just for the fans who show up in numbers, but also for the players, coaches, and everyone behind the scenes trying to make cricket big in the United States.When I first got involved, people were still unsure whether this was a passing interest or a long-term vision. Well, three seasons in, it's clear we‚Äôre here to stay. The quality of cricket has improved. The local talent has gotten better. The international stars are turning up in big numbers. And now, we‚Äôre playing in iconic venues like the Oakland Coliseum ‚Äì that's growth.Of course, there are challenges. The US isn‚Äôt like India or the Caribbean where cricket is integral. Most of the current fanbase comes from South Asian, West Indian or South African communities ‚Äì people who brought the game with them. The next step is getting more Americans involved, and that‚Äôs going to take time and investment. But you know what? We've already started, and that's what matters.As a coach, I love being part of this journey.My job isn‚Äôt just to strategise during the match ‚Äì it‚Äôs also to pass on what I‚Äôve learned, to help these young players understand the tempo of the game and to bring out their best. The skills are there. The passion is there. Now it‚Äôs about building confidence, playing fearlessly, and learning how to adapt.Infrastructure is another big piece to the puzzle. Our owners are already investing in a stadium in Los Angeles, and with the Olympics coming up in 2028, I hope that stadium will one day host cricket on the world‚Äôs biggest stage. That‚Äôs the vision. Franchises will hopefully build their own grounds and start academies. That‚Äôs how you create a pipeline.We‚Äôve already seen signs that this system is working. The USA national team surprised a lot of people at the T20 World Cup. Some of those players came through the MLC system. Imagine what can happen in five more years.Will cricket ever be as big as baseball or basketball in the US? I‚Äôm not sure. For a sport to reach that level here, it has to be homegrown, something the entire country embraces. But don‚Äôt count us out. There are powerful owners, passionate fans, and most importantly, players who are hungry.With the Olympics, World Cups and ICC events on the calendar, cricket now has the global stage. The US can be a part of that ‚Äì in fact, it already is.And me? I‚Äôm loving this phase. Coaching feels like my calling. I‚Äôve had my time on the field. Now it‚Äôs about helping others find their moment. Teaching players to love the game, stay grounded, and stay hungry ‚Äì that‚Äôs what matters.The US is learning to love cricket. The fans are coming.

NEW DELHI: It wasn‚Äôt one, it wasn‚Äôt two ‚Äî it was Yashasvi Jaiswal ‚Äôs fourth dropped catch of the match, and it came at a crucial juncture on the final day of the opening Test against England at Headingley.With India‚Äôs bowlers toiling hard for a breakthrough and the pressure mounting, Mohammed Siraj created a golden opportunity. He dug in a short delivery to Ben Duckett, who mistimed a pull and got a top edge. Jaiswal sprinted in, dived forward, got both hands to it ‚Äî but couldn‚Äôt hold on.The frustration was evident. Siraj looked visibly irritated, skipper Shubman Gill wore a look of disbelief, and when the camera shifted to head coach Gautam Gambhir , his anger was unmistakable.Jaiswal‚Äôs fourth drop in the match equals the most by an Indian fielder in a Test, as per available records ‚Äî a statistic he‚Äôll want to quickly forget.Earlier, India set England a target of 371 to win the first Test of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy after being dismissed for 364 in their second innings.KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant were the standout performers with the bat.

As Shubman Gill stepped onto the field at Headingley, all eyes were on India‚Äôs new, youngest Test captain. At just 25, Gill was handed the reins at a time of transition ‚Äî and immense expectation. However, his captaincy debut didn‚Äôt quite script a fairytale start. Despite India dominating large parts of the match, England‚Äôs remarkable chase of 371 handed Gill his first loss as skipper by five wickets. A promising first-innings century showed his intent with the bat, but the end result reminded everyone just how ruthless Test cricket can be for a young leader.Here‚Äôs a look back at how the previous 10 Indian Test captains before Gill began their journeys as leaders:Bumrah became the first fast bowler to captain India in Tests in decades. He picked up five wickets in the match, but England chased down 378 to win by seven wickets.Rohit began his captaincy tenure in style, leading India to an innings and 222-run victory. Though he scored only 29, it was a dominant team performance in his debut Test as skipper.Rahul scored a gritty 50 in the first innings but couldn‚Äôt stop India from slipping to a seven-wicket defeat.His brief stint as stand-in captain showed promise but lacked a result to match.Rahane led from the front with calm assurance, guiding India to a comfortable eight-wicket win. His knocks of 46 and an unbeaten 38* helped seal the series.Kohli‚Äôs captaincy debut was a memorable one. Taking charge in Adelaide, he scored centuries in both innings ‚Äî 115 and 141 ‚Äî and almost guided India to a dramatic win. Though India lost by 48 runs, Kohli made a powerful statement as leader and batter.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Dhoni‚Äôs Test captaincy began with a win. He made 32 in his only innings and India chased down a small fourth-innings target with ease.India‚Äôs legendary spinner had a dream start as captain, taking 7 wickets in the match and helping India to a six-wicket win in a closely contested Test.Sehwag had a forgettable outing with the bat with scores of 20 and 0 ‚Äî but India won by 259 runs, thanks to strong performances from others.Dravid‚Äôs captaincy debut ended in a draw. With the bat, he managed only 13 and 5, in a match dominated by New Zealand‚Äôs big first-innings total.Ganguly began with a commanding win against Bangladesh. He scored 84 and watched his side chase down a small target with ease, kickstarting a significant leadership era in Indian cricket.Shubman Gill‚Äôs first outing as India‚Äôs Test captain turned into a hard reality check as England pulled off a stunning chase of 371 runs to win the series opener by five wickets. Even though five Indian batters scored centuries, the team failed to capitalise when it mattered most. Missed catches, below-par outfielding and a lower-order collapse proved costly in the final moments.","India captain Shubman Gill made his Test captaincy debut against England.

NEW DELHI: England produced a brilliantly paced run chase to gun down a massive 371-run target and defeat India by five wickets in the series-opening Headingley Test on Tuesday ‚Äî with 14 overs to spare. The hosts pulled off the 10th highest successful run chase in Test history with clinical execution and unwavering confidence, even on a fifth-day pitch that initially seemed to favour India‚Äôs bowlers, particularly in the morning and afternoon sessions.A commanding 188-run opening stand between Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley laid the foundation, wiping out more than half of the required runs. The final flourish came in style, as Jamie Smith sealed the win with a towering knee-down six over long-on.Reflecting on the performance, England captain Ben Stokes credited his side‚Äôs relentless intensity and the crucial role of the bowlers in cleaning up India's lower order.""It was all about our attitude and commitment, day in and day out. That‚Äôs what we focussed on. Both teams played quality cricket ‚Äî a great way to start the series,"" Stokes said at the post-match press conference.""It was a very good wicket for batting. The way we knocked over the Indian tail was a big reason why we were able to chase down this score,"" he added.After a wicketless morning session, it was Prasidh Krishna and Shardul Thakur who unexpectedly provided India with breakthroughs in the afternoon. When Ravindra Jadeja dismissed Stokes after tea with 69 runs still needed, the tension briefly returned.However, Joe Root (53*) and Jamie Smith (44*) calmly guided England home, not allowing India even a glimmer of hope in the final stretch.With the win, England take a 1-0 lead in the five-match series. The second Test will be played at Edgbaston in Birmingham, starting July 2.""We're 1-0 up, but there are four more games. We'll celebrate and then quickly shift focus to Birmingham,"" Stokes said.The chase began under overcast skies with England resuming on 21/0, still needing 350 runs ‚Äî a daunting task by any measure. But England once again proved their chasing prowess under the guidance of coach Brendon 'Baz' McCullum, notching their 12th successful pursuit in 18 attempts during his tenure.This wasn't the usual high-risk ""Bazball"" spectacle ‚Äî it was a more measured and mature version of it. With a required run rate just under four per over, England managed the tempo smartly and stayed within that rate throughout.The contest also etched itself into the history books as only the third Test ever where all four innings crossed the 350-run mark.

WV Raman backs Shubman Gill to fire in England: 'He needs the right support'

England scripted a remarkable five-wicket win over India in the first Test at Headingley on Tuesday, chasing down 371 in record-breaking fashion to take a 1-0 lead in the five-match Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series. The hosts became the first team in over 60,000 first-class matches to concede five individual hundreds and still emerge victorious.Score: India vs England, 1st Test It was a day of milestones and heartbreaks. India posted a mammoth 835 runs across their two innings, with Rishabh Pant smashing centuries in both - only the second wicketkeeper in Test history to do so. Yet, collapses of 7 for 41 in the first innings and 6 for 31 in the second proved fatal, allowing England to stay in the hunt.Ben Duckett's blistering 149 set the tone, while Joe Root (53*) and debutant Jamie Smith (44*) polished off the chase with a calm, unbeaten 71-run stand. Smith fittingly sealed the win with a six, as England romped home at 373/5 in just 82 overs.India‚Äôs head coach Gautam Gambhir , however, chose to focus on the positives and refused to single out the bowling unit for blame.""We can‚Äôt question our bowlers after every Test.How will we groom them?

We lose together, win together.""On Shubman Gill ‚Äôs leadership in his maiden Test as captain, Gambhir was emphatic in his support: ""First Test, there are always nerves.

Poll Do you think India could have won the match if they had capitalized on key moments? Yes, they missed crucial opportunities. No, England played better overall.

Head down, Shubman Gill started that walk back to the change room with his team right behind him. Jamie Smith had clobbered Ravindra Jadeja for a maximum to seal the record chase, and give high-flying England a 1-0 lead over India in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.Smith and Joe Root were greeted by their teammates with warm hugs and high-fives but there was disappointment written all over the visitors' change room. The match was littered with moments where India could have landed the knockout blow but the inexperienced side failed to get over the line on the day where all three results were possible.Tension, drama, plenty of plays-and-misses and the sun kept playing hide and seek with the dark grey clouds until the last hour of Day 5 at Headingley. England were five down, needing 52 runs but the visitors kept coming hard at them, especially after the Ben Stokes wicket which lifted their spirits. There weren't a lot of runs to play with but Shubman Gill & Co. operated with a lot of self-belief and waited for the miracle. Miracles the likes of a double-wicket over, a wicket-maiden or the big wicket of local hero Joe Root to put the hosts under the pump.In search of that moment, after an attempt with the combination of Prasidh Krishna and Ravindra Jadeja, Gill went back to Shardul Thakur - the man who brought them back into the game with the wickets of Ben Duckett and Harry Brook - but even he couldn't do the 'Lordly' things the world is used to seeing when the ball is in his hand.The stadium was nowhere close to a full house but the ones who braved the cold, chilly winds, rain and the infrequent sun were having the time of their life and found their voice when drama peaked in the business hour.Oohs, aahs, Jaiswal getting ironically cheered for fielding the ball cleanly - they were well warmed up in the stands as India desperately sought the miracle.Luck wasn't going their way either. Edges would run between the slips, Root would continue doing Root things when on strike - solid, calm and composed. Bringing all his experience into play, the right-hander ensured he was calm in the eye of the storm. Jasprit Bumrah 's brief absence from the 67th over would have eased their nerves further as England, unlike their opponents, were not going to stage a lower-order collapse.The new ball was around the corner but Root got all his experience into play to up the tempo and ensure mere formalities were left when the shining red cherry became available again. Only 22 were left to be scored and Mohammed Siraj was handed over the new ball. There, however, was no late twist in store and the ending which was expected after that solid first session played out.Never has a side which scored five individual hundreds in the Test lost a game before India did in Leeds on Tuesday. Even after dominating for the majority of the Test, the visitors, in a comfortable position before Day 5 got underway, didn't get the result in their favour. They had runs to play with, they had a Bumrah and support cast around him but England's phased response, led by Ben Duckett, didn't allow the opposition to make any inroads.When the ball was still hard and new and the sky above continued to be dark and grey, both Duckett and Crawley frustrated India with a 188-run stand and the only way to stage a comeback at that point was going to be with wickets in a bunch. That didn't happen and England kept the run-rate in check to further deflate the opposition. It was extremely difficult for Gill, on captaincy debut, to find that balance between defence and aggression as the hosts comfortably overhauled the target with five wickets in hand.There is still some time before the second Test gets underway in Birmingham and India need to regroup and re-strategise for that fixture. The right bowling combination is going to be key and they definitely need to find the answers for both life with and without Jasprit Bumrah.","Jamie Smith clobbered Ravindra Jadeja for a maximum to seal the record chase, and give high-flying England a 1-0 lead over India in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.

India‚Äôs first Test of the five-match series against England ended in defeat at Headingley, and it brought with it a string of unwanted records for the Shubman Gill-led side, despite several sparkling individual performances.After setting a daunting target of 371 in the fourth innings, England overhauled it with remarkable composure, cruising to a five-wicket win after 82 overs on the final day. Ben Duckett‚Äôs sublime 149 set the tone, while Joe Root and Jamie Smith calmly steered the chase home.However, while England celebrated one of their finest modern-day fourth-innings chases, India‚Äôs unwanted records piled up. The biggest among them was that the visitors became the first team in Test history to lose despite notching up five individual centuries in the same match. This surpassed the previous record of four, set by Australia against England at the MCG way back in the 1928/29 Ashes.Pant‚Äôs pair of hundreds also made him only the second designated wicketkeeper to score centuries in both innings of a Test, joining Zimbabwe‚Äôs Andy Flower (2001).India‚Äôs batting effort across the two innings added up to 835 runs, making it the fourth-highest aggregate for a team in a losing cause in Test cricket Only England (861 vs Australia, Headingley 1948), Pakistan (847 vs England, Rawalpindi 2022), and New Zealand (837 vs England, Trent Bridge 2022) have scored more and still lost.For England, the 373-5 win over India is the second-largest target they chased in their history, only behind the 378-3 victory at Birmingham in 2022. Notably, two of England's biggest run chases have come in their last two home tests against India.This successful pursuit is also significant in terms of timing. It ranks as the second-largest target ever chased on the final scheduled day of a Test, behind only Don Bradman‚Äôs Australia (404 vs England at Leeds, 1948).As India look to regroup before the second Test begins on July 2, the records from Headingley will serve as an uncomfortable reminder that scoring big doesn't always necessitate results.","England beat India by five wickets in the first Test at Headingley.
