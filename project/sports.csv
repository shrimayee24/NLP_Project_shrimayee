'Making excuses is where our country will win gold medals': Gavaskar backs Prakash Padukone over Lakshya Sen criticism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/making-excuses-is-where-our-country-will-win-gold-medals-gavaskar-backs-prakash-padukone-over-lakshya-sen-criticism/articleshow/112470389.cms,"NEW DELHI: Legendary India batter Sunil Gavaskar voiced his support for badminton legend Prakash Padukone after he called for players to take responsibility and accountability following Lakshya Sen 's defeat in the bronze medal match at the Paris Olympics last week.Lakshya let slip an opening game advantage and an 8-3 lead in the second, ultimately losing 21-13, 16-21, 11-21 to Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia in a 71-minute match.Lakshya succumbing to the pressure left Padukone miffed as the former All England Open champion said it's high time that players learn to withstand pressure, become accountable and start delivering results after receiving support.However, Padukone's remarks sparked division within the badminton community, with doubles player Ashwini Ponnappa stating that his comments were equivalent to ""throwing the player under the bus.""But Padukone got the backing from none other than Gavaskar, who said our country has mastered the art of making excuses and would win gold medals every time if it were a competitive discipline.""He has always been reticent and publicity-shy, and he goes about his life with as much quiet as his famous dribble at the net. Therefore, his frank comments after the badminton disappointment came as a surprise to so many who have known him over the years to keep his counsel and not say much.""It also stirred up a debate where the majority tried, as is the modern way, to take the side of a current would-be champion and not that of a past-proven world champion. Making excuses is where our country will win gold medals every single time, so the debate around his assessment was more about that than looking without tinted glasses at what he said,"" Gavaskar wrote in a column for Sportstar.""And what did he say? He said that the players today get all the backing and facilities from their Federations and the government too. Therefore, they should take responsibility for their performances too. It was a point well-made and well-articulated too, without pointing fingers at anybody. Yet as it invariably happens in our country, which again is a champion at reading between so-called lines and imagining unintended poisoned arrows, we were quick to jump on him and denounce his comments rather than take the time to digest them and then come out with our comparatively uninformed views.""If a player is not going to take responsibility for his performance, then who is? So what wrong did he say? Some say the timing was wrong, but it's always better to say that when a player is searching for excuses and support rather than later. Yes, he could have said that privately in the changing room, but believe me, nothing has more impact on a player than a public rebuke. If he has the heart of a champion, then he will want to make the person who rebuked him eat his words. Otherwise, he will continue to flatter only to deceive,"" Gavaskar added.Gavaskar drew a parallel between Lakshya's performance and a recent comment made by the Indian cricket team Rohit Sharma. He had previously used the phrase ""Garden Main Ghoomne Vala"" to describe a certain situation.""To then see a 20-17 and 7-0 lead being squandered off in the semifinal and then lose the bronze medal match after winning the first game comfortably must have been gut-wrenching indeed. He, Vimal Kumar, the BAI and the government's TOPS had done everything possible, but when it came to the crunch, Lakshya was, in the famous words of the Indian cricket team captain,"" garden mein ghoomne wala,"" wrote Gavaskar.""For those who watched both the semifinal and the bronze medal matches, it did appear that Lakshya had lost his trend of thought and concentration in the way he looked at his racquet as he sipped from his water bottle in between points or at the changeovers. I could be completely wrong, but on TV, it looked like a blank expression, and that's usually a sign that the mind has wandered.""Concentration and focus are things that no coach or trainer can ever teach. It can be developed over the years by the athlete by observing other champions and having an inner resolve, but there's no specific programme for it. Yes, mind trainers are around, but they can only do so much and not more. It's got to be within the athlete,"" Gavaskar further stated.","Legendary India batter Sunil Gavaskar voiced his support for badminton legend Prakash Padukone. He said it's high time that players learn to withstand pressure, become accountable and start delivering results after receiving support. Lakshya Sen lost 21-13, 16-21, 11-21 to Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia in the bronze medal match.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112470428,imgsize-73896,width-400,resizemode-4/112470428.jpg"

"""I feel like I also am disappointed"" - Chad Gable sheds light on how the Sami Zayn feud disappointed him",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/i-feel-like-i-also-am-disappointed-chad-gable-sheds-light-on-how-the-sami-zayn-feud-disappointed-him/articleshow/112502753.cms,"I feel like I also am disappointed in the fact that I didn’t grab one during that whole run [against Sami Zayn],

From a storytelling perspective alongside the in-ring perspective, we got so much accomplished in such a short amount of time

Chad Gable desires to get his hands on a WWE Championship

Chad Gable and Sami Zayn were feuding pretty hard during the early months of this year. He added tons of credibility to his character when he turned heel, went after Zayn’s belt, and even managed to propel himself to the top of WWE. Gable was one of the best performers during his feud with Zayn, but unfortunately, he wasn’t able to get anything out of it.While speaking on the Insight podcast with Chris Van Vliet, Gable voiced his disappointment while shedding light on a number of other topics. He also spoke about his rivalry with Gunther and how beneficial that proved to be for his career. Let’s take a look at what else Chad Gable had to say:Gable was disappointed that he didn’t win the Championship belt from Zayn, but he’s still happy about that entire storyline because of all the good he and Sami were able to do in the ring. It’s not like Gable didn’t have his fair share of opportunities to take the belt off of Sami Zayn. There were a total of 12 title matches where Gable could’ve nabbed Zayn’s belt for himself.Unfortunately for Gable, Sami won all 12. Chad Gable has only won one out of the 13 matches he’s had against Sami since April. His luck has been so incredibly poor that the only match he won against Zayn was the only match that didn't have a title on the line. Then again, is it bad luck or just an incredibly poor performance from Chad Gable?Gable's hopes of getting his hands on the Intercontinental Championship belt came to an end when he lost against Sami on July 14, 2024. Since then, Chad has been beefing with the Wyatt Sicks. However, most of that feud has just been Chad running away any time the Wyatt Sicks show up.When Chad decides to stand his ground against the Wyatt Sicks by not running away, he gets beat up for it. Gable has also formed a new team by the name of American Made, which consists of him and the Creed Brothers. Chad tried putting up American Made against the Wyatt Sicks, but he and his new goons did not have enough in the tank.On the podcast, he also expressed his desire to get his hands on a title. However, 2024 has been incredibly poor for Gable. He has participated in 32 matches and has only managed to win six. If things continue this way, he can forget about ever getting his hands on a title in WWE. Gable needs to think outside the box and land himself a big win if he hopes to get back on the path to a championship belt.","Chad Gable and Sami Zayn were feuding pretty hard during the early months of this year.

By his own admission, 29-year-old Swapnil Kusale shoots more bullets than the words he speaks on a normal day. The shy Kolhapur rifle shooter doesn't plan to change this trait. He says it helps him focus more on his only priority - shooting.With a bronze in Paris Olympics, Swapnil became the first and only Indian to win a medal in the men's 50m rifle 3 positions event in Olympics history.Swapnil is only the second Olympic medallist from Maharashtra after Khashaba Jadhav's wrestling third-place finish in the 1952 Games. The soft-spoken, tall and 'fitness freak' shooter visited The Times of India's Pune office with his coach Deepali Deshpande , an Olympian herself (2004 Athens). They spoke about his journey to the Summer Games, his bronze-winning shot and how his dream of winning an Olympic gold is a work in progress.Swapnil said he was away from the social media for 6-7 months before leaving for Paris. ""I played some video games to de-stress and spend time with close friends,"" he said. The Kolhapur-born, Pune-based shooter is itching to get back to his routine and is ""avoiding overeating"" while his family and friends celebrate his success. He, however, doesn't mind a few extra servings of his favourite 'pooran poli', a Maharashtrian delicacy made of jaggery, chana dal and wheat.I am on a (forced) break for now. I am waiting for Deepali ma'am's call to resume practice. I am planning to slowly get back to my routine from September onwards and prepare for the World Cup Final.He feeds on shooting. Even after the Olympic trials, the team went to Munich; it was very hectic. I want him to take a break. But he cannot do without practice for more than four days.In his previous big finals, he had lost out on the medals because of the standing position. Prone and kneeling are his forte. He has been shooting in the prone since his junior days and defeated even Gagan Narang in prone final in the 2015 Nationals. But this time, prone was not bad, but somehow it was not on target. He made his weakness (standing) his strength and that made me quite happy.I was prepared to win (he missed the quota by a small margin) even for Tokyo. Our planning went for a toss due to the one-year delay due to the Covid pandemic.Because of the shorter Olympic cycle (three years), a few shooters, including Swapnil, were sitting on the fence. They were the easiest to train as they were already there (mentally and technically).I do not find thrill in 10m. I find 3P very challenging. My passion is 50 metres. It's thrilling, different, and an outdoor event. There are challenges of wind, light, managing three positions. The sound of the bullet excites me.I did not think much about the shots I missed. It was not worth thinking. What to think about the (preceding) bad shot in that fraction of a second (before the next shot) is also an art. My mentors taught me to just analyse why it happened and move on. I knew what went wrong at that point, so I corrected it and shot the next one.Though the noise is usually loud, this time I did not wear my earplugs. I tried this during the training too. Wearing earplugs made me conscious of my heartbeat and pulse. I was feeling those beats, which in a way put me under pressure. But when I removed the earplugs, the cheering from the Indian supporters motivated me and made me happy. I wanted to do even better in order to hear the cheer louder from the crowd.It is true. I like to listen more and talk less. It also helps a lot during shooting because we have to be at the lane all the time, so nobody talks to each other much. The self talk helps.I always tell them that once you talk to someone, you give them the right to talk to you. If you don't want anybody to talk to you, don't talk to them. His social circle is very small.When you see them grow, you get to know them in-and-out. Because of this long association, I got to know him so well that even while talking about his doubts from Paris on phone, I could sense the confidence from his voice. Such understanding happens only when you know somebody for a long time.(Vaibhav) Agashe sir has been helping me. He says talk to yourself as the anxiety lasts for a short time. It will go away only with self-talk. I go for a walk alone and speak to myself during such situations.My dream is to win an Olympic gold, which is still incomplete. I have been preparing for many years for this day. I applied these years of perseverance and made a promise to myself that come what may, I have to win. I enjoyed every bit of the journey from preparation for qualifications to the finals. I did not have any pressure as it may not help, so I chose to enjoy the road to the Olympics.Deepali ma'am is like my mother. She has seen my journey throughout my ups and downs, and my parents have always ensured I got everything I needed as I was building my career in shooting. Whether it was equipment or finances, they never let me know how they had arranged for the same for me. I had no idea how they arranged for all the money in the initial days, and I can never forget their sacrifices.(Laughs) Fortunately, I have been away from home since 2005 and led a hostel life from a very young age. I was in my village only till class IV.He is a very sincere boy. He has never misbehaved or been notorious. When I first went to the junior camp, I saw the boys, and I was thinking to myself how I would handle them. With Swapnil, however, there was never a problem. It never happened that he was called to a venue at a particular time, and he did not show up. He did not serve a single punishment in his three-year duration in the juniors category. Only once I remember in 2014, his match in the prone category was in the afternoon, and he and his teammates were shooting well. But they overslept and I saw swollen eyes. Shooters need alertness to apply the skills. If you don't sleep the entire night, you can still shoot well, but if you oversleep, then the coordination goes for a toss. That was the only time I was really angry with him. Otherwise, he is very disciplined, even with his eating habits. Once he decides some food item is not good for him, he will not touch it. Shooting is all about self-control.I miss everything about my home. In Maharashtra, we celebrate so many festivals, and I am not always there at home for the festivities, and I end up missing the family bonding during these occasions. Ultimately, these sacrifices are worth it when moments like these ( Olympic medal ) come your way. If you have a dream, you need to make these sacrifices and move on. I missed pooranpoli the most.","Swapnil Kusale won bronze in the men's 50m rifle 3 positions event at the Paris Olympics.

CAS defers verdict on Vinesh Phogat's appeal again; decision now on August 16,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/cas-defers-verdict-on-vinesh-phogats-appeal-again-decision-now-on-august-16/articleshow/112502834.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Court of Arbitration for Sport's ad-hoc division has once again postponed its ruling on Vinesh Phogat 's appeal against her disqualification from the Olympic finals. The new date for the decision is now set for August 16, which means the Indian wrestler will have to wait longer for a resolution to her case.Phogat, 29, was disqualified from competing in the women's 50kg freestyle final because she was found to be 100gm over the weight limit during the weigh-in process on Wednesday of the previous week.""The CAS ad hoc division president has allowed Hon. Dr Annabelle Bennett, Sole Arbitrator in the Vinesh Phogat vs. United World Wrestling (UWW) and the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) matter, an extension until 6-00 p.m. (Paris time) on Friday, August 16, 2024,"" a release from the IOA said.The case has been postponed for a third time, with no explanation provided for the delay.Vinesh, in her appeal, has requested that she be awarded a joint silver medal alongside Yusneylis Guzman Lopez from Cuba. Guzman Lopez had been defeated by Vinesh in the semifinal round but advanced to the final after the Indian wrestler was disqualified.Vinesh's legal representation consists of a team of French lawyers, including Joelle Monlouis, Estelle Ivanova, Habbine Estelle Kim, and Charles Amson. These attorneys have been assisting Vinesh and the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) throughout the process of submitting the application. The Paris Bar has assigned these lawyers to Vinesh's case, and they are providing their services pro bono.Additionally, senior counsels Harish Salve and Vidushpat Singhania were brought in to assist her with the case.The IOA had initially scheduled a virtual press conference with its president, PT Usha, and Salve, coinciding with the anticipated timing of the verdict. However, the invitation was swiftly retracted mere minutes after the CAS released its statement.Vinesh, a three-time Olympian, made the decision to retire from the sport just a day following her disqualification. She stated, ""I don't have the strength to continue,"" expressing her inability to carry on in the wake of the recent events.The world championships bronze-medallist took desperate measures to avoid disqualification, including cutting her hair, going without food and water, and working out through the night. Ultimately, she required IV fluids due to extreme dehydration, and her situation drew widespread sympathy.Top athletes like javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, hockey star PR Sreejesh, and cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar supported her and advocated for a silver medal.International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach later expressed understanding of her situation but questioned where the line should be drawn if small concessions were allowed in certain circumstances.""I must say, I have a certain understanding for the wrestler; it's clearly a human touch,"" Bach had said on Friday.""Now, it's (appeal) in CAS. We will, at the end, follow the CAS decision. But, again, the international (wrestling) federation, they have to apply their interpretation, their rules. This is their responsibility.""Nenad Lalovic, the United World Wresting (UWW) chief, however, remained doubtful that there would be any change in the results as they were only following the rules.""I am so sorry for what happened, but no matter the size of your country, athletes are athletes.

Memories of a lifetime for Manu Bhaker and Reetika Hooda,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/memories-of-a-lifetime-for-manu-bhaker-and-reetika-hooda/articleshow/112481404.cms,"PARIS: Manu Bhaker fuelled India’s hopes at the Olympic Games by bagging two bronze medals, so it was only fitting that the youngster came back from Delhi to carry the flag along with bronze winner and retiring hockey goalkeeper PR Sreejesh as the curtains came at the stroke of midnight here at the Stade de France.Manu, who won third place in women’s 10m air pistol and team events and narrowly missed another third place in the women’s 25 pistol final, enjoyed every moment of the three-hour long spectacle in front of more than 71,500 spectators, who filled the stands hours in advance for the program, that started with a musical performance followed by the entry of flagbearers from 205 delegations.Sreejesh and Manu walked in dressed in the official team colours with ‘India’ glittering in golden bold letters on the back as loud applause rang from the hundreds of Indians who had taken their seat for the closing ceremony. “It was an unforgettable moment and I’ll always cherish this day,” Bhaker said. The 22-year-old added that it was “such a great honour to carry the national flag”.Manu’s only disappointment was that she couldn’t capture some of the treasured moments on her mobile phone. “Manu lost her phone when she returned to Delhi. She put it in airplane mode and left it on her seat and forgot to take it with her after landing in Delhi. It was a big loss as it was the same phone that was gifted to her by the official sponsor at the Tokyo Games,” sources told TOI. “A complaint was lodged with the carrier and we searched in the lost-andfound items. But Manu’s mobile was not there,” sources added.Sreejesh, meanwhile, had no such problems and he was seen clicking away after they took turns to wave the national flag.Wrestler Reetika Hooda was among the lucky few in the Indian contingent who got to stay back to be part of the closing ceremony. “I felt very good to represent my country in front of such a large audience. It was a bitter sad moment for me as I missed out on a medal,” said Reetika, the first Indian wrestler to qualify in the women’s heavyweight category.For Reetika, the big moment was not to watch Hollywood star Tom Cruise take the Games flag to Los Angeles but to meet and greet Cuban wrestling legend Mijain Lopez. Lopez won his first gold at Beijing in 2008 and he retired here after winning his fifth straight gold in the men’s Greco Roman 130-kg category. “I’m not even a big fan of Bollywood, so Hollywood is very far,” she said with a smile. “But to meet and pose for a picture with Lopez sir was a priceless moment,” she told TOI.",Manu Bhaker and PR Sreejesh carry the national flag at the closing ceremony.

Kieron Pollard of Southern Brave delivered a match-winning performance by hitting Rashid Khan of Trent Rockets for five consecutive sixes during The Hundred on Saturday. His explosive batting helped Southern Brave to chase down a target of 127, achieving victory with just one ball to spare at the Rose Bowl in Southampton.Pollard's game-changing performance began when Brave needed 49 runs off the last 20 balls.Rashid Khan had been economical with figures of 1/10 from his first 15 deliveries, but Pollard dismantled his bowling in a single over.Pollard smashed the first two balls over cow corner and the long-off region, followed by a straight hit back over Rashid's head with the third ball. A powerful shot over deep mid-wicket came next, and Pollard topped off the over with a final six over long-off. This assault reduced the runs required to 19 off 15 balls.Despite being dismissed shortly after his blitz, Pollard’s rapid 45 off 23 balls had already shifted the momentum in Southern Brave's favor.

But I knew the lines and lengths he was likely to bowl,"" Pollard said.""I just backed myself - if he bowled short, I was going across; if he went full, I was going to hit straight. He bowled three fuller balls, and they were right in my arc. At that point, I couldn't hold back, I had to go for maximums. But Rashid is a world-class bowler; we've played a lot against each other,"" he added.Pollard's performance not only secured a crucial victory for Southern Brave but also underscored his reputation as one of the most formidable hitters in the sport.","Kieron Pollard hit five consecutive sixes during The Hundred on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: The sports community in India anxiously awaited the Court of Arbitration for Sport 's ( CAS ) decision on wrestler Vinesh Phogat 's appeal against her disqualification from the Paris Olympics gold medal match in the women's 50kg freestyle event.Vinesh had secured her place in the final with impressive victories, including a win over Japan's renowned wrestler Yui Susaki .However, during the mandatory morning weigh-in, she was found to be 100gm over the allowed limit, resulting in her disqualification.Devastated by the unexpected turn of events, Vinesh filed an appeal with the CAS last Wednesday, requesting a joint silver medal with Cuban wrestler Yusneylis Guzman Lopez , who had been defeated by Vinesh but was subsequently elevated to the final due to the Indian's disqualification.The day following her heartbreaking disqualification, Vinesh announced her retirement from wrestling, stating that she lacked the strength to continue. This announcement came as sporting icons from around the world rallied behind the 29-year-old wrestler, who was competing in her third Olympic Games.Prior to her journey to Paris, Vinesh had been at the forefront of a protest alongside fellow wrestlers Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik against the former Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who faced allegations of sexual harassment and intimidation from the renowned trio and other wrestlers.Numerous sports personalities expressed their support for Vinesh, including renowned Japanese Olympic champion Rei Higuchi, who experienced a similar situation in the Tokyo Olympics before claiming gold in Paris, and legendary American freestyle wrestler Jordan Burroughs, who urged the IOC to award Vinesh a silver medal.Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, who also believed Vinesh deserved at least a silver, champion shooter Abhinav Bindra, two-time Olympic medallist and superstar javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, and celebrated hockey player PR Sreejesh all voiced their support for Vinesh, reminding the nation of her contributions to the sport.On the day before the verdict, Vijender Singh, a bronze medallist boxer from the 2008 Beijing Olympics, also expressed his support for Vinesh.""Bhan @Phogat_Vinesh aap ke sath pehle bhi the ab bhi hai or aage bhi rahenge (Sister, I was with you earlier, with you now, and will be with you in future too),"" Vijender tweeted.Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), expressed his understanding of Vinesh's predicament. However, he raised concerns about the potential consequences of granting minor exceptions in specific cases. Bach questioned, Where would one draw the line after allowing small concessions in certain situations?On the other hand, Nenad Lalovic, the chief of United World Wrestling (UWW), maintained a skeptical stance regarding any potential alterations to the outcomes. He emphasized that they were strictly adhering to the established regulations. Lalovic's stance suggested that a revision of the results was unlikely, as the organization was bound by the rules in place.""I must say, I have a certain understanding for the wrestler; it's clearly a human touch,"" Bach had said on Friday.""Now, it's (appeal) in CAS. We will, at the end, follow the CAS decision. But, again, the international (wrestling) federation, they have to apply their interpretation, their rules. This is their responsibility.""Lalovic added, ""I am so sorry for what happened, but no matter the size of your country, athletes are athletes. This weigh-in was public, everyone saw what happened.

Salve, who served as the Solicitor General of India from 1999 to 2003, brings a wealth of experience to the table. He notably represented India before the International Court of Justice in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case.Should the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) rule in Vinesh's favor, she will be awarded a joint-silver medal in the women's 50kg freestyle category, recognising her outstanding performance and the merits of her case.",Vinesh Phogat was disqualified from the women's 50kg freestyle event.

The 41-year-old, who recently joined the England side as a bowling mentor for the remainder of the Test summer, believes he can still utilize his swing bowling skills at the highest level.Anderson's decision to consider franchise cricket comes after witnessing the ball swinging during The Hundred competition. ""I watch The Hundred and see the ball swinging around in the first 20 balls and I think, I can do that, I can still do that. I do not know if that is a viable option, to maybe see if I could do a job in white-ball cricket. Franchise cricket is something I have never done,"" he said on The Final Word Podcast, as quoted by Wisden.Despite his retirement from international cricket, Anderson has not completely ruled out the possibility of playing domestic cricket. The 42-year-old believes that his current physical condition and bowling performance in recent years suggest that he could still contribute to the game.""The way that my body feels, the way I have been bowling in recent years, I still feel I could potentially have something to offer on that front,"" he stated.James Anderson, the former England pacer who amassed an impressive tally of 188 Tests, 194 ODIs, and 19 T20Is throughout his career, expressed confidence in his ability to challenge English batsmen in the nets, despite his retirement from international cricket.""Bowling at the England lads in the nets, you have to have change-ups and slower balls. We constantly work it, so I do not think [the skills and variations] will be an issue. But I do not know how much people will want a 42-year-old bowler in their team so we will have to wait and see,"" Anderson remarked, acknowledging the potential hesitation teams may have in recruiting a veteran bowler.The retired seamer also shared insights into the discussions that took place with coach Brendon McCullum , team director Rob Key, and captain Ben Stokes prior to his decision to retire.Anderson revealed, ""I was told it was 'Lord's or never again' and I decided I wanted to have one more go in England; I wanted my family and friends to see me play one more time.""While England's management felt it was an opportune moment to explore other talent and pursue a fresh direction, Anderson maintained a composed demeanour.""England felt it was a good time to look at other players and wanted to go in a different direction. I would not say I was happy. But I did not kick off, I did not feel upset and having the opportunity to stay around the group in a different role interested me as well,"" he stated, expressing his openness to remaining involved with the team in an alternative capacity.",Former England pacer James Anderson has expressed his interest in exploring franchise cricket opportunities.

The veteran wicketkeeper-batter, who has always put the team before self, is ready to play in any capacity. With youngster Abhishek Porel shining behind the stumps for Bengal and also in the IPL for the Delhi Daredevils, Saha is ready to give the youngster his space. “Abhishek joined us (senior Bengal) after being part of India U-19 World Cup squad and I had told the then Bengal coach Lalji (Arun Lal) to give him more opportunities. So if the team management feels right, I have no objection in him keeping wickets. I will play as a batter,” Saha stated.Approaching the twilight of his playing days, the 39-year-old Saha is not looking too far ahead. Although the IPL mega auction is scheduled later this year, Saha is not focussing on that . “I could have quit playing some formats to focus on IPL only. But that’s not my plan. All I can say is that when I retire I will do it from all formats of the game at the same time,” the Siliguri boy said.Saha, who has played 40 Test matches, which is just three less than Bengal legend Pankaj Roy, also sounded content with his India career. “I have never played the game thinking of achieving milestones.

NEW DELHI: Manolo Marquez , the newly appointed head coach of the Indian football team , described his new role as a 'dream come true' but emphasized that in the future, the national team should ideally be managed by an Indian.The 55-year-old Spaniard's tenure, effective from last month, will span three years, during which he will fulfill a dual role as both the head coach of FC Goa and the national team.Marquez, who will manage FC Goa during the 2024-25 season alongside his national team responsibilities, will transition to exclusively coaching the Indian team from 2025.""Apart from Spain, India is the country where I have spent the most number of years. Long time ago, I thought I would like to be a national team head coach and I am here.

So, this has to be the target of Indian football in the coming years,"" he added.Marquez has been active in Indian football since 2020, having spent three successful seasons with Hyderabad FC. He also had a notable season with FC Goa, achieving a third-place finish in the Indian Super League (ISL ) this year. His upcoming international assignments include the three-team Intercontinental Cup, to be held in Hyderabad from September 3 to 9, featuring Syria and Mauritius alongside India.Following the Intercontinental Cup, Marquez will lead the team in the VFF Tri-Nation Series in Vietnam from October 9 to 15, competing against Lebanon and hosts Vietnam. Both tournaments will take place during the FIFA international match window, and the national camp for the Intercontinental Cup is scheduled to commence on August 30 or 31.Addressing concerns about potential conflicts of interest while serving as both India head coach and FC Goa manager, Marquez stated that this situation, although unusual, is not unprecedented.""It's not a normal situation, no doubt, but it's not the first time and won't be the last time regarding this situation.""I checked, in international level, there were big names earlier in same situation and in India, I am told there were many (such cases) earlier.""National team plays when there is no ISL.

That is how you grow as a player. That is why more Indian players should play in the ISL. That is why my advice to Indian players is to play abroad even if it is lower division leagues.""They will learn more and improve more (by playing abroad). But the Indian players are comfortable playing in the ISL, in India but I want them to play abroad,"" Marquez said, adding that Indian football has improved in the last five years but can improve further.Marquez also said he will pick I-League players for the national team, if they have the requisite level.Asked what is lacking in an Indian player as seen in his five-year association with the country at club level, he said, ""It's the mentality of the players, we need to improve on this. We have to develop that we can do something, we have to be stronger in mentality.""If the mentality is right, we will get good results.
