"Divided by conflict, Meiteis and Kukis unite on a football field",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/divided-by-conflict-meiteis-and-kukis-unite-on-a-football-field/articleshow/128361924.cms,"IMPHAL: In villages across the foothills near western Imphal, young men have spent nearly three years taking turns through the night, standing at the edge of their settlements with sticks and torches after elders decided vigilance was no longer optional. In Kuki villages, night patrols began almost immediately after clashes erupted on May 3, 2023. In Naga-majority ones, they intensified after tensions flared in Litan this week.Some of these youngsters were brought to Assam Rifles' New Keithelmanbi Garrison earlier this week after finishing guard duty that morning, reports Vishant Agarwala. They are footballers. From Monday to Thursday, 13 teams - eight Naga, three Meitei and two Kuki - from nearby villages gathered at the garrison's uneven, dusty football ground for Assam Rifles' Foothills Football Tournament, organised under Operation Sadbhavana.Keithelmanbi lies along the seam where the Imphal Valley rises into the surrounding hills, a geography that has hardened into buffer zones and guarded perimeters. The teams were named after nearby villages. But even a distance of 4km can carry more meaning than it suggests.The Kuki teams - including Haibung FC which reached Thursday's final - crossed the buffer zone for the first time since May 2023 in Assam Rifles buses with guards.Football has often mirrored deeper fractures within societies already under strain. The 1990 clash between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade came to symbolise Yugoslavia unravelling. The so-called ""Football War"" between El Salvador and Honduras in 1969 entered history as an example of how a match can ignite terrain already primed for conflict. In those instances, football did not invent grievance, it amplified it.In Keithelmanbi, football was asked to restrain.The organisers approached the tournament with caution. Senior Assam Rifles officers addressed the teams before kickoff and made the terms clear: play in the spirit of the sport; any attempt to injure an opponent would result in an immediate red card; an extremely severe offence would lead to disqualification of the entire team.""Refereeing is always contentious, so we used soldiers from outside the northeast,"" an officer told TOI. Security personnel lined the perimeter. From the commentary area, a Hindi voice narrated play and returned to one appeal whenever tackles grew heavy: ""Khel ki sadbhavana banaye rakhein. Referee ke nirnay ka paalan karein."" Maintain the game's spirit. Referee's decision is final.The first semifinal at 8am on Wednesday featured two 100% Meitei teams - New Keithelmanbi Team B and KTYWA Keinou. The second carried a heavier backdrop. Khonglong Naga Youth Club faced Haibung FC.Days earlier, violence had flared between Kukis and Nagas about 100km away in Litan in Ukhrul district. Though Khonglong's village had not suffered direct damage, anxiety spread quickly. Naga youngsters too began night patrols. Families hesitated before allowing the team travel. ""People were worried,"" one Khonglong player said. ""But if we stop meeting completely, that is not good for the future.""On the pitch, there was no spillover. Haibung dominated in a largely one-sided contest. When the match ended, the handshake was steady and unforced. It set up a final few had predicted - the first Kuki-Meitei football match since May 3, 2023.Haibung's story explains why reaching the final carried weight beyond sport. The squad's average age is 19. Instead of focusing on training, many found themselves playing night sentries. ""For our own safety,"" one said. ""That doesn't mean we want to fight another community.""""We don't sleep properly on those days,"" another player said quietly. ""But it is our responsibility."" They were excused from duty for the duration of the tournament.Haibung coach Ngamgoulen (30) had returned from Delhi, where he had been preparing for the Manipur civil services exams, on April 28, 2023. Within weeks, his village was attacked five times. His cousin Nilson Kuki's house burned down. Movement became restricted. Reaching the nearest airport required crossing a buffer zone. With routes to Imphal airport blocked, residents travelled via Aizawl or Dimapur.Gogo, as he is known, did not leave his village. ""As the younger brother of the village chief, it was my duty to be there for my people."" His belongings remain in Delhi.Haibung defender Seiminthang Haokip (20) now lives in a relief camp after his village was burned down twice and is still waiting for the next stage of his Territorial Army application. Fullback Thangkhopao Singsit (21) had been preparing for CDS examinations when his village was attacked in July 2023, leaving three villagers dead and one still missing.Goalkeeper Chongouman Kipgen (21) ran a private school with his father that employed teachers from Meitei, Kuki, Naga and smaller tribes, and they were in the process of starting another school before the conflict made coexistence impossible. Midfielder Thangminsei Kipgen (19) teaches at the only functioning community-run school in the area, managed by Kuki Students' Organisation, after most qualified teachers left the state.By the time the final began, the stands were full. Villagers had been brought in Army vehicles under armed escort, joining elders and locals. Senior Assam Rifles officers were present.The first half was intense. New Keithelmanbi was in control. By halftime, the Meitei side had built a 3-0 lead. Haibung regrouped during the break and scored two goals soon after the match resumed. Midway through the second half, a tackle triggered protests and brief shoves before Assam Rifles personnel intervened. The commentator's reminder - ""khel ki sadbhavana banaye rakhein"" - returned. The game concluded 5-2 in favour of New Keithelmanbi. There were five yellow cards in the match.When the final whistle blew, players formed a line and shook hands without hesitation. The exchange was brief and routine. ""We just played,"" one said afterwards.Security personnel remained until the teams dispersed. The Meitei side returned toward the valley. Haibung FC boarded Assam Rifles buses and travelled across the buffer zone under armed escort - to villages where night patrols would resume.","Assam Rifles' Foothills Football Tournament held at New Keithelmanbi Garrison. 13 teams - eight Naga, three Meitei and two Kuki - from nearby villages gathered.

Why Traditional Marriages Are Being Replaced By New Love Models

The many faces of gamophobia

Fear of dependency or vulnerability

Fear of repeating past relational trauma

Fear of losing one’s identity

Fear of failure in love

Fear of societal expectations tied to marriage

When love is easy, but forever is not

Not equal to inability to love

Why fear of commitment might be growing

A culture of choice and comparison

Individual identity over collectivism

Witnessing relationship breakdowns

Trauma and attachment styles

Changing gender roles and expectations

Gamophobia in India: Between tradition and modernity

Marriage as familial responsibility

Pressure to settle down early

Fear of “what will people say”

Arranged marriage traditions

Gendered expectations around roles

Not all fear is pathology

In a world where relationships have become both more visible and more complex, a curious psychological phenomenon has been quietly gaining attention — gamophobia, the fear of commitment or marriage.It is more than just the occasional cold feet, jitters before a proposal or hesitation about settling down. Gamophobia is a deeply rooted, lived experience that can colour every connection, shape life choices, and define what love looks like for many individuals. Increasingly, mental health professionals, writers and even everyday couples are referring to this concept not just as a quirky term, but as a genuine emotional resistance.Ankur Halder, 27-year-old IT professional, put it perfectly-The word “gamophobia” itself comes from the Greek gamos (marriage) and phobia (fear). At its core, it speaks about the fear of marrying or entering into long-term intimate commitment. Yet, in practice, it is far more nuanced. People who struggle with gamophobia are not necessarily afraid of love or companionship. Instead, they fear the permanence, vulnerability, expectations, and potential loss of autonomy that life-long attachment can entail.But why is this fear becoming more visible now? Why are more people open to calling themselves “afraid of commitment”? Is this simply a symptom of a generation spoiled for choice, or is it rooted in deeper psychological and social shifts? And importantly — what does this look like in a place like India, where marriage still carries cultural gravity unlike many parts of the world?To explore these questions, we must go beyond the label and into the lived realities that make gamophobia resonate in the twenty-first century.Gamophobia is not a clinical diagnosis in major psychiatric manuals like the DSM-V; it is a loosely defined term used in psychological, cultural and pop-psychology circles. Yet, its emergence reflects real emotional and relational patterns that therapists see every day.For some, it manifests as anxiety or panic when conversations about the future get serious. For others, it shows up as chronic relationship sabotage — starting strong, pulling away, or falling into self-fulfilling breakups before things get too real. Some experience sleeplessness, avoidance, or physical symptoms at the thought of tying their life to another.Importantly, gamophobia is not just about fear of marriage. It can express as:For a growing number of young Indians, this fear is not abstract. It surfaces at a very specific moment — when romance begins to gather weight.In this country, relationships rarely remain suspended in emotional possibility. They are expected to culminate. They must formalise. They must move toward marriage.And it is often at this threshold that something shifts.Aarav, 32, who works at an MNC in Mumbai said over the past decade, he has been in three serious relationships. Each followed a similar rhythm: an intense beginning, emotional intimacy, shared vacations. For months, sometimes years, everything felt certain.Then came the conversations about meeting parents. About timelines. About “where this is heading,"" and began to withdraw.“I don’t know what happens,” he says. “It’s like something switches off. I start imagining all the ways it could go wrong. What if I lose my freedom? What if I’m not ready? What if I choose wrong and can’t undo it?”Gamophobia often unfolds in exactly this way. Individuals form romantic bonds with ease. They are affectionate, attentive, emotionally engaged. But when a relationship approaches formal commitment — engagement, marriage, shared finances — anxiety spikes. The future stops feeling romantic and starts feeling irreversible.One of the most persistent myths about gamophobia is that it signals emotional immaturity or incapacity for deep feeling. This assumption could not be further from the truth.People who struggle with commitment anxiety often love intensely. They may be attentive partners, emotionally available in the present, and genuinely invested in their relationships. The difficulty does not lie in affection. It lies in anticipation.For some, the fear is rooted in childhood experiences. For others, it stems from witnessing marital dissatisfaction. And for many in contemporary India, it arises from the weight of making the “right” decision in a world that offers both endless choice and irreversible consequences.In that sense, gamophobia is less about rejecting love and more about fearing a mistake that cannot be undone.A 29-year-old woman (choosing to stay anonymous) grew up watching her parents argue behind closed doors while maintaining a composed public image. Divorce was never discussed. Silence was easier than separation.“When people talk about marriage,” she says, “I don’t picture romance. I picture staying even when you’re unhappy.”Children absorb more than they realise. When marriage is modeled as endurance rather than companionship, commitment can subconsciously begin to resemble confinement.We live in an age where options, especially romantic ones, feel infinite. Dating apps, social media, global mobility, and curated images of “the perfect relationship” create an illusion of endless possibility. When one believes that the next swipe might be better, committing to one person can paradoxically feel limiting rather than reassuring.This reflects deeper cognitive patterns of comparison, fear of missing out, and choice overload. Instead of narrowing options feeling comforting, it can trigger anxiety about losing potential alternatives forever.In recent decades, individualism has become central to people’s sense of self. Career goals, personal growth, and self-discovery are prioritized more than ever. While this is empowering, it also changes how relationships are viewed. Commitment starts to feel like a trade-off — balancing autonomy with attachment.Ankur Halder said, ""I believe a healthy relationship should consist of two independent individuals choosing to be together. Relationships today have evolved, unlike older generations like say my grandparents, where partners were often overly dependent on each other. I appreciate that relationships now allow more individuality.""We grow up surrounded by stories of failed marriages, divorces, and high-profile celebrity breakups. Seeing relationships fall apart shapes our ideas about commitment — making it feel risky rather than romantic.How we bond emotionally is influenced by early life experiences. People with avoidant attachment often fear losing independence in close relationships. Those with anxious attachment may fear being abandoned, even in healthy partnerships.Someone whose early friendships ended abruptly may struggle to fully commit to a partner, worrying that closeness will lead to inevitable loss.Traditional roles, like men as sole breadwinners and women as primary caregivers, have changed, but old expectations don’t disappear overnight. Women don’t want to be bound by household duties, and years of social conditioning have made many feel that, at some point, they’ll have to sacrifice their dreams to fulfill the expectations of a relationship.People everywhere often find themselves balancing new possibilities with inherited norms, creating tension in romantic relationships as they navigate who does what, how decisions are made, and what each partner “should” contribute.In India, marriage has long been treated as a central life milestone- expected, celebrated, and often orchestrated by family.Urbanisation, increased female workforce participation, and exposure to global culture have changed how young Indians think about partnership. Emotional compatibility and personal growth matter more than ever before.At the same time, entrenched expectations persist:In this environment, gamophobia can take on unique contours. For some, it becomes resistance against pressure, a boundary against societal coercion. For others, it reflects genuine uncertainty about whether traditional marital structures align with their evolving identities.Adding another layer of complexity, leaving a partner in India is often socially difficult. Relationships are not just between two individuals — they are entwined with family expectations, social judgment, and, in many cases, children.In India, many hesitate to end relationships even when they feel unfulfilled, fearing the stigma of separation or the impact on their children. This has created a common misconception: staying despite unhappiness is often interpreted as commitment or proof of love, when it may instead reflect social pressure and obligations.Intergenerational values also play a role. Many Indian families prize endurance and sacrifice in relationships. While admirable, these ideals can unintentionally silence emotional needs. Young adults may find themselves torn between honoring tradition and honoring their own readiness.Mental health awareness in India is still developing. Anxiety around commitment may be dismissed as stubbornness or irresponsibility rather than understood as emotional complexity. Without language for their fears, many individuals internalise guilt instead of seeking support.It is crucial to recognise that gamophobia is not always dysfunction. Fear can be protective, especially after painful or unstable relationships. It may signal the need for clarity, healing, or stronger identity formation.In a society that often equates marriage with success, choosing to pause or question is not necessarily avoidance. It may be discernment.Challenging conventional marriage norms, Ankur said, “I have a somewhat sceptical view of marriage. While I understand that it works well for many people, most marriages I’ve observed seem complicated and full of ongoing issues. That has made me question whether the institution itself is necessary, or whether commitment can exist in other forms.”Gamophobia is a mirror. It reflects personal insecurities and broader cultural change. It reminds us that commitment is not merely a social contract, but an emotional decision shaped by history, identity, and context.In India and beyond, the increasing visibility of commitment anxiety does not mean a generation is incapable of love. It suggests that people are thinking more deeply about what love demands.And perhaps, in asking those difficult questions, we are not drifting away from commitment but are learning to approach it with greater awareness.Love, after all, is not weakened by reflection.It is strengthened by choice.","Gamophobia is a deeply rooted, lived experience that can colour every connection, shape life choices, and define what love looks like for many individuals. People who struggle with gamophobia are not necessarily afraid of love or companionship. Instead, they fear the permanence, vulnerability, expectations, and potential loss of autonomy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128343268,imgsize-1504417,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-6.jpg"

Fans remain worried over Leon Draisaitl’s health once he returns to the NHL



Concern is mounting in Edmonton over the health of Leon Draisaitl after fans noticed the Oilers superstar repeatedly icing his right hand during Germany's Olympic Games. The injury appears to be lingering from an incident against the Minnesota Wild on January 31.Draisaitl left that game to have his right hand evaluated by the Oilers medical staff, but returned to play. With the Olympics on the horizon, any player would push through pain to represent their country at such a significant event. Unfortunately, the Olympics may be worsening whatever hand issue Draisaitl is dealing with.Fans have observed him icing his right hand on the bench after nearly every shift during Germany's first two games at the Milano Cortina 2026 tournament. Despite the apparent injury, Draisaitl continues to give his best effort for Germany.He has one goal and three assists through two Olympic games and leads all German players in shots on goal. Germany opened with a 3-1 victory over Denmark before falling 4-3 to Latvia in a stunning upset on Saturday morning. Draisaitl fired 10 shots in the loss to Latvia, over a third of Germany's total attempts.The 29-year-old center has been one of the tournament's most active shooters despite clearly managing discomfort.His willingness to play through pain shows his commitment to representing Germany on hockey's biggest stage.For the Oilers, this is major bad news. They are set to return for the home stretch of the league as they push for the playoffs. While Edmonton has managed to be within postseason contention with 64 points across 58 games, Draisaitl’s injury might put a stopper on their overall gameplay.Not to mention, the German center remains the Oilers' second-best point scorer this season with 80 points. Without him on their top line, their effectiveness could go down in a blink. In the scenario that his injury is worse than expected, he might miss the remaining regular season while his hand heals.The Oilers would prefer their superstar return at full health before the playoffs rather than playing through lingering discomfort. For now, Oilers fans can only watch nervously as Draisaitl continues representing Germany while managing what appears to be a significant hand issue.His dedication to playing through pain is admirable, but also worrying for a franchise counting on him. Germany faces the United States on Sunday at 3:10 p.m. ET to conclude Group C preliminary round play. How Draisaitl's hand holds up in that matchup could determine whether he needs treatment after returning to Edmonton.",Leon Draisaitl has been icing his right hand during Germany's first two games at the Milano Cortina 2026 tournament.

The end of a player’s time with a team is often measured in numbers, but for Chris Bassitt, his Toronto chapter will be remembered for something far more meaningful. As the veteran right hander officially begins a new journey in the American League East, the Toronto Blue Jays chose to highlight his impact beyond baseball. Before fans focused on contracts or roster changes, the organization made sure to recognize the difference he made in the community.Over three seasons, Bassitt and his wife Jessica committed themselves to Jays Care initiatives that support youth through sport and mentorship. Their Pitch-In initiative became a steady source of funding for programs aimed at helping children grow through baseball. The impact was not symbolic. It was financial, consistent, and deeply personal.“Thank you to Chris and Jessica Bassitt for their incredible support of Jays Care over the past three seasons. 💙 Through the Bassitts Pitch-In initiative, the Bassitt family generously donated over $500,000 CAD to kids in Jays Care programs and made an immeasurable impact on our community. We’re deeply grateful and wish you all the best in your next chapter!”That message captured why Bassitt’s departure carries emotional weight.His $500,000 CAD donation will continue supporting children across Canada, ensuring his influence remains long after his final outing in Toronto.Now, Bassitt turns the page with the Baltimore Orioles, staying in the competitive AL East. His move keeps him in a division he knows well, but in a new uniform and role.Last season, Bassitt went 11 9 with a 3.96 ERA across 32 regular season appearances as Toronto claimed the American League pennant. During the postseason, he stepped into a relief role and posted a 1.04 ERA with 10 strikeouts in seven outings. His flexibility and steady presence proved valuable in high pressure moments.Entering his 11th major league season, Bassitt will turn 37 on Feb. 22. Throughout his career with the Chicago White Sox, Oakland Athletics, New York Mets, and Toronto, he has compiled an 83 65 record with a 3.64 ERA. For Baltimore, he adds experience and stability. For Toronto, he leaves a lasting legacy that extends far beyond the mound.","Blue Jays thank Chris Bassitt for $500K commitment to Jays Care programs.

Matt Weston and Alex Howard-Jones plan their wedding after Milano Cortina Winter Olympics 2026



British skeleton racer Matt Weston is on the verge of winning Great Britain’s first medal of the 2026 Winter Olympics. The 28-year-old has made a strong start in Milano Cortina and leads the standings after the opening two runs. He holds a 0.30-second advantage heading into the final runs on Friday evening. Expectations were high because he arrived as the reigning world, European and overall World Cup champion, and he has so far matched the hype.Away from the ice track, Weston is also enjoying a big year in his personal life. He is engaged to his long-time partner Alex Howard-Jones, and the couple plan to marry in July after the Games. Their relationship has been visible on social media for years, with photos together dating back to 2016. They also share their home with a ten-year-old cocker spaniel named Logan.While Matt Weston chases Milano Cortina Winter Olympics 2026 success, his fiancée Alex Howard-Jones has built her own career. She is a chief operating officer (COO) and a founding member of pltfrm search, an executive search firm based in London. Reportedly, the couple plans to celebrate their wedding just months after the conclusion of the Winter Olympics, meaning 2026 could become the biggest year of Weston’s life both professionally and personally.Notably, Matt Weston did not begin his sporting journey in skeleton racing. He first played rugby and later trained in taekwondo. Many people expected that he would become one of Britain’s top winter athletes. He only started skeleton racing in the summer of 2017 and made his World Cup debut in January 2020.His rise was quick. In 2021, Weston won a World Cup gold medal. It was the first time a British man had done so in more than 13 years. He then became Britain’s first skeleton world champion in eight years in 2023. The last British champion before that was Lizzie Yarnold back in 2015, while Kristan Bromley was the last British male champion in 2008.Last season proved his most successful yet. Matt Weston secured back-to-back overall World Cup titles and also reclaimed his world championship. That form made him one of the favourites for the Milano-Cortina Games.","Matt Weston is on the verge of winning Great Britain’s first medal of the 2026 Winter Olympics.

2026: A torn shoulder, a silver medal, and a different kind of win

2018: Chloe Kim turns PyeongChang into a launchpad

2022: Beijing cements the back to back halfpipe champion

Where Chloe Kim sits now in snowboarding history

On a snowy night in Livigno, Italy, Chloe Kim led the women’s halfpipe final after an 88.00 opener, then watched 17 year old Gaon Choi snatch gold with a 90.25 on her last run. Kim fell on her own final attempt and settled for silver at the 2026 Winter Olympics.This was the shot at a once in a lifetime headline: the first three straight Olympic golds in any snowboarding event. Instead, Kim walks away with three Olympic medals total, two gold and one silver, and remains the only woman with back to back halfpipe titles while Shaun White still stands as the only rider with three golds overall.A month before Milan Cortina, Kim tore the labrum in her left shoulder during training in Switzerland and admitted she was unsure she would even make it to the Games.She still qualified first, then played it safe on her opening run in Livigno, banking that 88.00 while other riders slammed in heavy snow. Choi crashed hard in her first run, needed treatment in the pipe, then came back to land the run of the night and grab gold on her third attempt.Kim had a choice on that last drop: repeat the cleaner, safer first run or throw the hardest combo on her sheet, including the cab double 1080 that has defined her progression.She chose violence. She caught the wall, slid out, and the three peat vanished.Even then, she refused to mope. “In my eyes, I’m a winner, because I was able to persevere and fight through,” she told reporters, per Time. On the way down the hill she walked hand in hand with boyfriend Myles Garrett of the Cleveland Browns, who called watching her ride “exciting but terrifying.”She is expected to undergo shoulder surgery once she is back in the United States.Kim did not arrive in PyeongChang as a mystery. She already had X Games golds and had become the first woman to land back to back 1080s in competition.At 17, she turned that hype into something concrete, winning women’s halfpipe gold with a 93.75, then nearly touching perfection with a 98.25 on her final run. She became the youngest woman to win Olympic snowboarding gold and the youngest to land two 1080s in a row at the Games, jumping past Kelly Clark’s age record in the process.Four years later in Beijing, Kim arrived with fame, pressure, and time away from the sport behind her. She qualified first, then ended the final early with a 94.00 on her opening run in Genting Snow Park.Her last two attempts turned into lab experiments. She tried new tricks, fell both times, and still won by a margin that made everyone else look like they were fighting for silver. That result made her the first woman ever to win back to back Olympic halfpipe golds.There is still no true three peat in Olympic snowboarding. Kim’s silver joins failed bids this week from Ester Ledecka in parallel giant slalom and Anna Gasser in big air, both of whom also saw their runs at a third straight gold shut down in Milan Cortina.Kim’s resume is already in rare air: three Olympic medals, eight X Games golds and a stack of world titles, plus progression tricks like the double cork 1080 and a historic 1260 that moved the entire field’s ceiling.So yes, the golden three peat story died in the Italian snow. But the bigger picture is ugly for everyone else: even on a torn shoulder, even on a night when a teenager finally beat her, the bar in this sport still has Kim’s name on it.","Chloe Kim fell on her final run in the women’s halfpipe final in Milan Cortina, Italy.

Norway’s Johannes Høsflot Klæbo added another huge moment to his already legendary career after winning the men’s 10km freestyle race at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano-Cortina. The victory gave him his eighth Olympic gold medal, tying the all-time Winter Olympics record. Klæbo finished 4.9 seconds ahead of France’s Mathis Desloges, showing once again why he is one of the biggest stars in cross-country skiing right now.It was also his third gold medal at these Games, making him one of the standout athletes of the tournament so far. His win quickly became one of the most talked-about moments of the day. Fans have watched him dominate event after event, and many now wonder if he will go on to break the record before these Olympics end. With more races still ahead, the Norwegian skier has a real chance to make even more history in Milan.Johannes Høsflot Klæbo’s latest win added another chapter to a career that has already been packed with success.Before Milano-Cortina, he had won gold medals at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang and again at the 2022 Games in Beijing.His titles include victories in the individual sprint, team sprint, and relay events, making him one of the most complete skiers in the sport.Now tied on eight gold medals with Norwegian greats Bjørn Dæhlie, Marit Bjørgen, and Ole Einar Bjørndalen, Klæbo has placed himself among the biggest names in Winter Olympics history.More importantly, he still has three races left at these Games: the relay, team sprint, and 50km mass start, meaning the record could soon belong to him alone.Klæbo’s performances have also caught the attention of fans beyond the skiing world. A video of his uphill sprint from earlier in the Games went viral online, gaining over 15 million views on X.American skier Ben Ogden, who finished behind him in the sprint race, summed up the challenge of racing against the Norwegian by saying, “I like to go to every race thinking that it’s a race for the win, but these days, a lot of the time it’s a race for second.”With the final week of competition still ahead, all eyes are now on Klæbo to see how much further he can push his Olympic legacy.","Johannes Høsflot Klæbo won the men's 10km freestyle race at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano-Cortina.

Slovakia is making believers out of everyone in Milan. After shocking the hockey world with a 4-1 dismantling of defending Olympic champion Finland in their opener, Slovakia held off a spirited Italian side 3-2 at Rho Arena on Friday to remain perfect in Group B.It was not the blowout many expected, but captain Tomas Tatar and his teammates found a way to secure the victory. Italy, playing in front of a passionate home crowd, refused to go quietly against Slovakia; they pushed even harder in today’s game.Slovakia has been the biggest dark horse so far. Despite lacking any of the firepower of the “Big 4 Nations,” they have thrilled fans and critics alike. Meanwhile, the hosts had already proven against Sweden that they could compete with elite competition, trailing just 2-2 in the second period before eventually falling 5-2.The 35-year-old Tatar, who spent 14 NHL seasons with six different teams, has been instrumental in Slovakia's success. He recorded 496 points across 927 regular-season games at the highest level before returning to Europe this season with Zug in Switzerland's National League.His leadership on Slovakia's top line alongside Juraj Slafkovsky and Adam Ruzicka has given the Slovaks one of the tournament's most dangerous units.Slafkovsky, the 2022 Olympic MVP, already has nine career Olympic goals at just 21 years old, trailing only Marian Hossa and Miroslav Satan on Slovakia's all-time list.Despite the loss, Italy has earned respect throughout the tournament. With zero NHL experience on their roster, they have competed hard against Sweden and Slovakia, two teams loaded with professional talent.The host nation has shown they belong at this level, even if the results have not gone their way.

Influencer Clavicular and the Arizona State University fashion show that sparked the framemogging trend

The phrase “Clavicular Framemogging” suddenly took over social media this week. People saw it, paused, and read it again. It sounded confusing. Some even thought it was a medical term. But it is not. It is an internet joke that grew very fast after a viral video from Arizona State University. The trend began when an influencer known as Clavicular appeared at a fashion show at Arizona State University, often called ASU. A short clip from the event started spreading online.In the video, Clavicular is seen standing beside a much larger fraternity member. Viewers quickly began using the phrase “Clavicular was brutally framemogged” to describe what they saw. Within hours, the phrase turned into memes, reaction posts, and debates across social media platforms. Many users were confused at first, then they joined in and that is how the trend exploded.To understand the moment, it helps to know who Clavicular is. He is a niche influencer connected to online looks-focused communities. His content talks about posture, bone structure, shoulder width, and facial balance. He often breaks down how physical proportions affect appearance.The word “mogging” comes from online slang. It means someone visually overpowers another person. “Framemogging” focuses only on body frame, not clothes or face. It is about shoulders, build, and overall outline.During the Arizona State University fashion show livestream, Clavicular was standing next to a fraternity member with a broader build. Viewers noticed the clear difference in size and frame. Soon after, clips were reposted with captions saying, “Clavicular got framemogged.”The irony made people react even more. Clavicular’s content often studies body structure. In this clip, viewers felt he was outmatched in the very area he talks about. That contrast is what made the phrase funny to many users.Another reason the trend grew so quickly is the name itself. “Clavicular Framemogging” sounds dramatic and complex. Internet culture often turns strange, very specific words into viral jokes. Once a few big meme pages shared it, the phrase spread widely.There is no official medical or scientific meaning behind it. It is simply internet slang born from a viral moment at Arizona State University. Still, the influencer’s fashion show debut gave the phrase a face, a setting, and a story. That helped it move from confusion to full trend in less than a day. In the end, the trend shows how fast online language changes. A short campus clip turned into a catchphrase that thousands of people repeated within hours.",The phrase “Clavicular Framemogging” suddenly took over social media this week.

Italian tennis star Jannik Sinner shared heartfelt words for fellow Italian athlete Federica Brignone after her inspiring gold medal win at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano-Cortina. Brignone, who suffered a serious leg injury less than a year ago, returned to competition and claimed gold in the Super-G event. Her victory quickly became one of the biggest stories of the Games, not just because of the medal, but because of the difficult journey she went through to get back on the slopes.The 35-year-old skier had broken her left leg during the Italian championships and needed two major surgeries. Many people believed she might miss the Olympics completely. Instead, she returned in remarkable fashion and even set a new milestone by becoming the oldest Alpine skier to win Olympic gold. After the race, Sinner openly admired her determination and praised her effort in a moving reaction.Jannik Sinner spoke about Brignone’s achievement in an interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport, calling her comeback extraordinary.He said, “She’s a phenomenon. After everything she’s been through, being able to come back and achieve this result is something extraordinary.”Sinner had earlier spoken about how difficult injury recovery can be, especially in a sport like skiing. During the Australian Open, he explained that skiing carries huge risks and long recovery periods.He said, “Skiing and tennis are totally different sports because on the slopes, if you get hurt during the season, you’re out all year. It’s a really dangerous sport; when you step out of the gate, you have to be brave.”He also praised Brignone’s hard work behind the scenes, adding, “What Federica has done… to be able to experience the Olympics is incredible… she’s done something incredible that almost no one can do.”While Brignone celebrates her historic win, Sinner is now turning his attention back to tennis. The Italian started his 2026 season at the Australian Open but lost in the semifinals to Novak Djokovic.He is expected to return to action at the Qatar Open in Doha, where rival Carlos Alcaraz is also set to compete. Djokovic, however, has withdrawn from the tournament.Brignone’s victory and Sinner’s reaction have brought together two major Italian sports stories, showing how athletes from different fields often inspire each other during big moments like the Winter Olympics.",Federica Brignone won gold in the Super-G event at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano-Cortina.

This is such a special opportunity, and still feels pretty surreal to be here and be able to compete and put on this jersey and play with this group of guys. It’s a great start for us in this tournament, and we’ll look to build off it.”Matthews further spoke about the early adversities the team faced at the initial stage, “It’s fine. Those things happen all the time. You know, can’t really complain about it. The ref maybe didn’t see it. Was a little shaken up, but felt fine and just kept playing and just go from there,” he said.As per reports, Brady Tkachuk scored first at 5:29 in the first period with help from his brother Matthew. In the second period, Team USA took control as the team got three goals from Brock Nelson and Tage Thompson.

Chris Paul’s rise from rookie of the year to perennial All-Star

Chris Paul's retirement marks the end of a historic statistical legacy

Chris Paul, one of the best and most respected point guards in NBA history, has officially called it quits after 21 seasons in the NBA. Confirming the end of his storied career, the 40-year-old made the announcement in an emotional statement. Paul embodied elite leadership, precise playmaking, and fierce competitiveness over the next two-plus decades, cementing a legacy as one of the greatest floor generals in the history of the sport.Paul has been a consistent Hall of Fame-level talent since back when he was a teenage legend. The retirement closes the book on a career that spanned three eras of the NBA and signals the end of one of the most impactful careers the league has seen.Chris Paul was the fourth overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft, selected by the then-New Orleans Hornets; he quickly became a franchise player. Winning the NBA Rookie of the Year award in 2006, he was soon distinguished by his nearly unparalleled awareness on the court, his ball handling, and his defensive acumen.During his career, Paul was named to 12 NBA All-Star selections, received 11 All-NBA honors, and nine consecutive All-Defensive Team nods.His leadership made several franchises better, and most famously, he led the Los Angeles Clippers to heights they had never reached before, guiding the “Lob City” era and making the team a regular playoff team.Aside from his stint with the Clippers, Paul played a pivotal role for the Houston Rockets, Oklahoma City Thunder, Phoenix Suns, Golden State Warriors, and San Antonio Spurs. He took the Suns to the 2021 NBA Finals, two wins short of clinching the elusive title that eluded him during his Phoenix playing days.Chris Paul's retirement was swift, but it ended a career filled with records and consistent greatness. He's 2nd all-time assists and steals 2nd respectively, arguing his position as the greatest playmaker and best perimeter defender of all-time. Reinforcing his blend of scoring and distribution, Paul has scored more than 20,000 points while recording over 10,000 assists.Paul should have a room full of those fine letters, but no NBA title ever be displayed, crowning his résumé. He was president of the National Basketball Players Association, a trusty mentor to younger stars, and an embodiment of professionalism and basketball smarts.","Chris Paul has announced his retirement after 21 seasons in the NBA.

At present, the status of Morrissey’s injury is unclear, but if he is unable to return, his roster spot will be difficult to replace after Canada officially registered 25 players on February 10.Announcing the same on X/Twitter, Steven Ellis stated, “Both Brad Marchand and Josh Morrissey are listed as scratches for Canada today against Switzerland. Jordan Binnington also went dress. #Olympics.” Meanwhile, according to Kyle Bukauskas, ""Brad Marchand is taking a rest, too."" It is expected that Marchand will be back, but for now, he can recharge and get ready for the upcoming important matches.As per reports, in place of these players, Carolina’s Seth Jarvis will make his Olympic debut. He will play alongside Bo Horvat and Sam Reinhart on Canada’s third line. The other three forward lines will remain untouched, with Sam Bennett serving as the 13th forward.

Almost a year after JPMorgan made 5 days work from office compulsory and CEO Jamie Dimon said don't tell JPMorgan what to do at Townhall; some employees fear petition that they call ‘career ...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/almost-a-year-after-jpmorgan-made-5-days-work-from-office-compulsory-and-ceo-jamie-dimon-said-dont-tell-jpmorgan-what-to-do-at-townhall-some-employees-fear-petition-that-they-call-career-suicide/articleshow/128211254.cms,"When Jamie Dimon's angry outburst at Townhall went viral

In March 2026, it will be a year since America's biggest bank made 5-day work from office compulsory. The largest US bank, which employs more than 300,000 people globally, told all of its employees to return to the office five days a week starting in March, ending a hybrid work-from-home policy that took effect during the pandemic. Just days after CEO Jamie Dimon's order to all employees to come into the office five days a week, a petition surfaced. The petition, which was part of complaints over JP Morgan's call to bring employees back to office 5 days a week, asked CEO Dimon to reverse the change. The petition that continues to be live online is addressed to chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. In the petition, employees have complained about losing hybrid working arrangements. ""Some employees sought advice from the Communications Workers of America on how they might set up a labor union, a rare thing in the US finance sector.And now a year since the petition was set up, it has about 2,000 signatories out of the Bank's more than 300,000 global employees. According to a report in Financial Times, there are some who believe that signing the petition will be a ‘career suicide’. The report details internal backlash to the 5-day mandate.As per the report, employees at the America's largest lender told the Financial Times they were bewildered by management’s insistence on a full-time return to company offices, though teams are scattered across the globe. “My team is spread out through two continents and three time zones,” said a JPMorgan employee who signed a petition to bring back hybrid work. “JPMorgan is a global company — why can’t that include my home office?” “Hybrid is working and employees love the happy medium,” the staffer told the FT. ""We, the workers of JPMorganChase (JPMC), are concerned about the future of our workplace - its integrity, employee satisfaction, and the increasing toxicity that has metastasized in our company culture in the last couple of months,"" reads the petition.Dimon announced the five-day return to office policy on January 10, 2025, ahead of a March 2025 start date. Soon after announcing the change, Dimon went viral for angry outburst he had about the employee petition during a Town Hall meeting. When asked about the in-person work policy during the staff meeting, he said, ""Don't waste time on it. I don't care how many people sign that fucking petition,"" he said, drawing some laughter. Instead, Dimon demanded more efficiency and stressed employees have a choice whether to work at JPMorgan. The CEO told them not to be mad at him, and said it was a free country.Dimon, who has run the lender for 19 years, said some staff did not pay attention during Zoom meetings, which reduced their efficiency and creativity. In-office requirements will not be left up to managers, Dimon said. ""There is no chance that I will leave it up to managers,"" he said. ""Zero chance. The abuse that took place is extraordinary.""In an interview to CNBC, Dimon said, that he respects employees who don't want to come into the office five days a week, but said the policy will not change because it is best for clients and the company. ""I am not against working from home, I am against where it doesn't work,"" he said, adding that 10% of the bank's jobs are done remotely.Later in the year, in an interview to Bloomberg, Dimon said that he also understands the appeal of logging in from home; remote work can pan out well for some companies and certain roles. Talking about his angry response to a question on work from home, he said, “I gave a very detailed answer about why [work from home] doesn’t work for young people, why it doesn’t work for management, why it doesn’t work for innovation,” Dimon said. “I completely applaud your right to not want to go to the office every day. But you’re not going to tell JPMorgan what to do.”","JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon ordered all employees to return to the office five days a week starting in March 2025.

Olympic hockey captivates Dallas Stars fans as USA, Canada and Finland give must-see performances



Canada dominates with shutout in Olympic opener

Although Dallas Stars fans may be in their second week without NHL action, the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics games are ensuring that hockey fans are not left out. The fact that the men’s and ladies’ games are on, with some Dallas Stars players featuring in these games, ensures that Olympic action is the new alternative to NHL action for Stars fans.With Team USA’s dominance, along with Canada’s loaded roster and some surprising results for countries in the bracket early on, the Olympic tournament has provided no shortage of storylines and even some intra-club flair with Dallas players representing different countries.The men’s tournament has been intriguing. Finland entered the tournament as the defending Olympic gold medalists, but they fell in a major early upset to Slovakia. In the meantime, Canada started their tournament dominantly, dispatching Czechia 5-0, with Stars defenseman Thomas Harley recording two assists. Canada has a potent roster, highlighted by generational talents Connor McDavid and Nathan MacKinnon, a duo that speaks to the danger of the overall team.Meanwhile, in the women's tournament, the United States and Canada again appear to be the top teams favored to win. The United States blew through the preliminary games undefeated, scoring five goals in every game, giving up only one goal in the six games, including a shutout against Canada. Veteran forward Hilary Knight tied the United States Olympic Games point record at 32 points and may do it again during the medal games, creating another historic narrative.Team USA bounced back from a chaotic first period of play against Latvia, during which the Latvians had two goals called back, to post a convincing 5-1 win. Against the Latvians, the Stars' goalkeepers, including Stars goaltender Jake Oettinger, could see action in the team's upcoming games with Denmark and Germany. Even the Dallas fans were treated to an apparent near-scrap between teammates Radek Faksa and Harley during international play.The Dallas Stars begin NHL play on Feb. 25 with a six-game winning streak, but until then, Olympic hockey represents the ideal substitute—perhaps with the bonus of bragging rights for Stars players returning home with medals.","Olympic hockey captivates Dallas Stars fans as USA, Canada and Finland give must-see performances.

Sean Strickland questions division momentum and potential matchup



Former UFC middleweight champion Sean Strickland has criticized Khamzat Chimaev for what he calls long stretches of inactivity in the 185-pound division. Strickland believes the division’s momentum has slowed because top contenders are not fighting often enough. He argued that a championship scene depends on regular bouts and clear movement in the rankings, and that gaps between fights have made the title picture less exciting for both fighters and fans.Strickland also suggested the current situation affects the value of competing for the belt. According to him, the uncertainty around when top contenders fight makes it harder for athletes to plan their careers. Chimaev is widely regarded as one of the division’s most dangerous fighters, but injuries and delays have kept him from competing consistently. Strickland believes this lack of activity has reduced urgency around the championship and changed how fighters view title opportunities.Sean Strickland stated that the limited appearances of Khamzat Chimaev have weakened the division’s competitive structure. He claimed a top contender who competes only once a year slows rankings and creates confusion about who deserves a title shot. He also said fighters may now see regular bouts as more profitable than waiting for a championship opportunity.Speaking in a recent interview with ESPN MMA, Strickland said, “You brought a guy in that fights once a year… He’s just gonna sit on that f*** belt and wait until they force him to fight.” He added, “You would make more money not fighting for the belt than you would fighting for the belt. The belt is not even in my brain anymore. I’ll make significantly more money just fighting. Every time this f*** guy fights, he has a mysterious injury. ”He also spoke about a potential fight, expressing confidence in his abilities and suggesting he could defeat Chimaev. “That’d be a big fight. I think I’m probably the only one that could beat Chimaev. I honestly think Fluffy is a better wrestler than Chimaev. Over five rounds, Fluffy is a better wrestler than Chimaev.“ He further questioned Chimaev’s position, stating, “It’s kind of weird what the UFC did with Chimaev. You brought a guy that fights once a year - the guy doesn’t need to fight. He’s best friends with a warlord”, he added.Strickland believes frequent competition from elite fighters is necessary to maintain credibility and fan interest in the UFC middleweight division.",Former UFC middleweight champion Sean Strickland has criticized Khamzat Chimaev for what he calls long stretches of inactivity in the 185-pound division.

Zimbabwe’s 23-run win over Australia in the ongoing T20 World Cup has also drawn attention to a past trend involving India in global tournaments. On earlier occasions when Zimbabwe defeated Australia in a World Cup, India went on to lift the title.Zimbabwe recorded the first major upset of the ongoing T20 World Cup, defeating former champions Australia by 23 runs on Friday at R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.This was only the second time Zimbabwe have beaten Australia in this format. The previous win came in the 2007 edition of the tournament.After being asked to bat, Zimbabwe scored 169 for 2, led by opener Brian Bennett’s unbeaten 64 and contributions from other top-order batters. Australia were then bowled out for 146 in 19.3 overs on a slow pitch.In the 2007 edition, Zimbabwe, under Prosper Utseya, had beaten Australia by five wickets with one ball remaining in a low-scoring match in Cape Town.Blessing Muzarabani took 4 for 17. Brad Evans claimed 3 for 23, while Wellington Masakadza (1/36) and Ryan Burl (1/9) also picked up wickets.Chasing 170, Australia lost early wickets and were reduced to 29 for 4 in 4.3 overs.Josh Inglis (8), Travis Head (17), Cameron Green (0) and Tim David (0) were dismissed cheaply.Matt Renshaw scored 65 off 44 balls, while Glenn Maxwell made 31.

The partnership ended when Maxwell edged a delivery from Ryan Burl onto his stumps.Australia needed 56 runs from the last five overs. Marcus Stoinis, who had earlier left the field after being struck during the Zimbabwe innings, was dismissed for 6.Brian Bennett took a catch near the boundary to dismiss Ben Dwarshuis (7), giving Brad Evans his third wicket.Australia required 34 runs from 12 balls but lost Renshaw and Adam Zampa (2) in the 19th over.

NEW DELHI: Zimbabwe pulled off a major upset in Group B of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, defeating Australia by 23 runs at the R. Premadasa Stadium on Friday. After posting 169 for 2, Zimbabwe successfully defended the total, bowling Australia out for 146 in 19.3 overs.Despite the setback, stand-in Australia captain Travis Head urged calm, pointing to their turnaround in the 2023 ODI World Cup after a shaky start.""We've been there before. I said at the toss, we saw it in 2023 with a few defeats and injuries. We have a few guys here who were there in India in 2023 and we'll look to navigate this situation and use that blueprint.""Head explained that the decision to field first was influenced by the nature of the pitch, which he believed would play consistently across both innings. He felt the target was within reach.""We thought it's a good wicket. A bit tacky at the start and we thought it would be even through the two innings. Even though we only took two wickets, I thought they were a bit under par.""But we lost early wickets and came under pressure. They played well. I still felt like we'd have taken the score and were happy to chase that.""The feedback throughout was that it was a good wicket. We put ourselves under pressure by losing wickets.We found a partnership in the middle but we left ourselves with too many.""Australia’s campaign has also been impacted by injuries. Mitchell Marsh remains unavailable with a groin problem, while Tim David recently returned from a hamstring strain.Their pace resources are stretched as well, with Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood missing — marking the first time since 2011 that Australia are competing at a World Cup without Cummins, Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc together.","Zimbabwe beat Australia by 23 runs in Group B of ICC Men's T20 World Cup.

Talent alone decides the outcome, and Arshi's talent has spoken loudly.Her rise may appear meteoric, but behind the trophies lies a routine that would test even seasoned athletes. ""I wake up at 5 am, have breakfast, and I'm on the track from 8.30am to 4 pm,"" Arshi says. The long hours are not an occasional grind but a way of life.She embraced the schedule even more intensely before leaving for UK to train. ""She kept doing it because she enjoyed it,"" her relatives say.Arshi began karting at seven. Two years later, she stood atop the national podium — her journey built on discipline, sacrifice and relentless preparation. During the 2025 national season, she delivered multiple victories, including commanding wins in Chennai and Bengaluru, and excelled on neutral tracks where drivers are given equal practice time.""Neutral tracks bring out pure skill,"" says her father, Anchit Gupta. ""That's where Arshi performed exceptionally well.""Recognising the limitations of India's short racing calendar, the family looked abroad to sharpen her competitive edge. She trained extensively in UAE for five months, immersing herself in a high-intensity environment.The move paid off. Arshi secured a third-place finish at IAME UAE Championship, becoming the youngest Indian on an international karting podium. She followed it up with a strong fourth-place finish at Asia Pacific Motorsports Championship in Sri Lanka, competing against older and more experienced drivers.In UK, too, she adapted swiftly, steadily closing the gap to seasoned front-runners within weeks. Through it all, she has drawn inspiration from former Formula 1 world champion Max Verstappen. ""He trains very hard, and he is really professional in the way he prepares for races,"" Arshi says of her favourite driver, a reflection of the standards she has set for herself.Despite the punishing training schedule and frequent travel, academics are still firmly in her focus. ""I study on flights after races or whenever I have time. My mom teaches me,"" she says. The balancing act has earned her a principal's gold medal in school for excellence in academics and co-curricular achievements.What stands out most, however, is Arshi's composure. ""I don't get nervous. I just enjoy the sport and give my best,"" she says, betraying a mindset rare for her age and invaluable in a sport where fractions of a second define outcomes.With her selection to the F1 Academy programme, which will support her development through 2026, the road ahead looks bright for Arshi. At nine, she is not just racing competitors twice her age. She is racing against time, expectation and history. And so far, she is comfortably ahead of the pack.",Arshi Gupta is India's youngest national karting champion. The nine-year-old is also the only female in Asia in a mixed-gender format.

Dance, drums and fun! Team India land in Colombo | Hardik Pandya with Mahieka Sharmaindia arrival-

Kolkata: Some wobbles, some worries and in the end Mohun Bagan Super Giant got just what the doctor ordered — a 2-0 win over Kerala Blasters to start their defence of the ISL title here on Saturday.Jamie Maclaren put Sergio Lobera’s side in front in the 36th minute and Tom Aldred came off the bench to head home the second goal to polish the victory up deep into injury time.However, it was not the kind of rise-and-shine moment the 30,000-odd fans present at the stands would love to be thrilled with.The defending champions’ path to victory was strewn with some avoidable potholes here and there, something which one might be tempted to attribute to their opening match rustiness and ineptitude.It was Petratos who had a direct role in breaking the deadlock. The Bagan No. 9, receiving the ball inside the box from Apuia, laid it off quickly for fellow Australian Maclaren, who steered clear of Aiban Dohling’s challenge with a sharp turn to beat the goalkeeper Sachin Suresh with a left-footed low volley. Bagan thereafter had more possession and more territory, but they couldn’t control the opponents, who looked more ambitious in the second half, especially with the arrival of Kevin Yoke.Sensing the problem, Lobera introduced Aldred in the 81st minute, taking off Petratos. Defender Aldred calmed the nerves for his team, rising to the occasion to meet Anirush Thapa’s free-kick and beating the Blasters goalkeeper for the second time. It also ensured a perfect start to the Lobera reign at the club as the Spaniard has now kept the record of a winning debut in the ISL for all four clubs he has managed so far.",Mohun Bagan Super Giant beat Kerala Blasters 2-0 in ISL opener.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

Rourkela: The way the game began here on Saturday, it seemed as if it was going to be a repeat of the Argentina game.But the Indian men’s hockey team found their footing to make sure Belgium did not run away with the game even after scoring four goals in the first 17 minutes — all from the penalty corners. Unlike the last match, India also found the target twice with Aditya Arjun Lalage scoring the first in the 24th minute while Harmanpreet Singh converted a PC in the 37th to the delight of the capacity crowd at Birsa Munda Stadium.However, despite their better showing, the bottom line is India were handed their third defeat in as many matches as Belgium won 4-2 to make it seven wins in eight matches in the tournament.Coach Craig Fulton was not happy with the start but was satisfied with the structure.“We had a bit of a slow start. It’s never easy when you make one or two mistakes and a good team like Belgium will punish your mistakes. And that was on the PCs. So, we had a few too many soft turnovers that ended up in counter attacks,” said Fulton.“We had better structure and we were more organized. They didn’t have any one-on-one. It was better. Now we have to add more detail to not giving away as many PCs because that was the difference.”Earlier, India began well and created some good chances. Lalage even found the net once but it was ruled out following a video referral.However, it was after this that the Belgian onslaught began, as they won three penalty corners in the last four minutes of the first quarter. Hugo Labouchere converted the first; Alexander Hendrickx struck from the second, and Arthur de Sloover made it 3-0. As the second quarter began, the Belgians did not take their foot off the pedal and grabbed their fourth PC two minutes later. Once again Hendrickx found the net to make it four goals from four PCs.India, however, eventually pulled one back after Abhishek made a run down the middle and took a shot at the goal. It was saved by goalkeeper Loic van Doren but Lalage was able to scoop it out from underneath his legs and into the net.In the third quarter, India improved a lot and did their best to hold on to the ball. They showed grit and fought back. They grabbed their first PC, too, after a good run by Sukhjeet Singh into the D and Harmanpreet was able to convert it.They won another PC towards the end of the quarter but this time Harmanpreet’s shot was saved by de Sloover standing at the post. Vivek Sagar Prasad collected the ball and played it to Abhishek, who sadly failed to keep it on target.India played their best hockey in the fourth quarter but by then it was too late. Fulton even took away the goalkeeper with three minutes remaining but they failed to find the target.

Salman Agha press conference: Pakistan captain on hand shake, India and Playing XI

Colombo: The Premadasa was buzzing on Saturday afternoon. The general talking point one could overhear around the sizeable media contingent from both sides was on the lines of “let’s finish off the enemy”.Thankfully, there was no fire exchanged when Salman Ali Agha, the Pakistan captain, began his pleasantly surprising interaction.Agha displayed remarkable poise and an admirable, non-combative approach. His message was loud and clear — the Pakistan cricket team is here to play a game of cricket and not fight a proxy war.While almost every question from the Indian contingent was entertained, it was Agha’s response to a question on Abhishek Sharma’s health that revealed, most of all, what an excellent sports ambassador he was.“I really hope he recovers and plays the game. He is a terrific player and we want to play against the best,” Agha said, just showed all the respect that the best T20 batter in the world deserves.It sounded quite contrary to what Agha’s one-time teammate Mohammed Amir had said on a television show a couple of days ago, dismissing Abhishek as a “slogger”.It didn’t take long for the Pakistan media to rake up controversy, bringing up Harbhajan Singh’s comments on spinner Usman Tariq’s controversial bowling action. Agha was asked, “An Indian bowler whose action was questioned during his playing days is now questioning Tariq. What do you have to say?”Agha was in no mood to add fuel to the fire. “People are entitled to their opinion and they can say what they want to say.I can tell you, Tariq himself doesn’t care. He is smart and mature. For us, he is just one of the 15 players, nothing more, nothing less.”There was a smile on Agha’s face when another Pak journalist took a cue from their training methods on Friday and asked whether they are “targeting some of the Indian players like Abhishek”. “We are not ‘targeting’ any player, we are just trying to counter what India has to offer as a team,” the captain said.And that was not enough. Questions were asked about the recent acrimony, all that has happened since the Asia Cup last Sept and whether Agha would be interested in shaking hands with the Indian captain. “It’s not up to me. And it doesn’t matter what I expect. If you ask me, I think the game should be (played in) the same (manner) since cricket started. The rest is up to them, whatever they want to do,” said Agha.Liberal or not, Agha is still the Pakistan captain. The pressure is immense and the demand is to win every game. He accepted that “India have been better than us in World Cups”. Asked whether he loses sleep over the immensity of the assignment, Agha smiled again. “I am sleeping okay.
