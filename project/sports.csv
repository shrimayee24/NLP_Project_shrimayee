Tigress in 'boar' well: Prey and hunter's joint survival tale,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tigress-in-boar-well-prey-and-hunters-joint-survival-tale/articleshow/117928086.cms,"BHOPAL: Panchtantra met Jungle Book in the forests of Seoni , Madhya Pradesh, when a tigress chasing a boar fell into a well, along with the prey, in the heat of pursuit. Trapped in a battle for survival, both the hunter and hunted treaded the water together, often rubbing against each other in the closed confines.The two mostly faced away from each other. The tigress probably realised predation was pointless if it couldn't eat the kill. The boar, with nowhere to run, followed the predator's lead, even leaning on it when tired. Both were rescued by evening by forest officials with some jungle jugaad . Thereafter, each went its own way.Fittingly, this drama played out in the forest that was the setting for Kipling's 'Jungle Book'. Mowgli's Seoni is in Pench national park , around 400km from Bhopal. Villagers of Piparia Harduli, in Jikurai forest area, were in for a shock when they made their morning walk to the well to fetch water - a tigress and a boar were looking up at them. The tigress, exhausted from swimming, was visibly tired but remained calm. The boar would struggle from time to time just to stay afloat, trembling more from its proximity to the tigress than the cold water.Villagers alerted forest office. Kurai forest range assistant Shariq Khan got the call. A team from Pench tiger reserve, along with police, arrived on the scene and realised that there was no manual for such a rescue and they had to come up with some jugaad.The well was roped off to keep villagers well away from the scene of operation. Foresters worked out a system of ropes and tackles and used a JCB and a hydraulic crane to lower a cot and a cage into the well. The tigress lunged at it, and grabbed on to it, roaring, growling and refusing to let go. Foresters knew the cot would break under the tigress' weight and tried to push it away with a stick. The tigress snarled and roared and swiped at the stick, but it eventually got the message and went back into the water. When the cage was lowered, with its trapdoor open, the tigress attacked it. It took a while to understand that the metal beast wasn't going to swallow it and gingerly climbed into it, to cheers from the rescue team. The trapdoor fell shut.The boar, meanwhile, had realised that the cot was meant for it and climbed on to it. Both animals were pulled to safety. The boar was released back into the forest. The tigress, believed to be about three years old, will be released in Nauradehi sanctuary of Veerangana Durgavati tiger reserve in Sagar.","A tigress chasing a boar fell into a well, along with the prey, in the heat of pursuit.

Pat McAfee said he thought Travis Kelce was too polite to the media

Kansas City Chiefs superstar tight end Travis Kelce admitted that the storyline has been the fact that the Chiefs seem to be getting more slack from the referees during Super Bowl Opening Night. ESPN analyst Pat McAfee thought Travis was too nice to the media and said what he thought Travis wanted to say. Kelce and the Chiefs are trying to become the first team in the NFL to three Super Bowl wins in a row, but their streak has been tainted with controversy over the close calls the Chiefs had in the AFC Divisional Round and the AFC Championship Game.Travis Kelce, a Kansas City Chiefs star, addressed controversial topics during Super Bowl opening night, including his proposal to Taylor Swift and his NFL retirement timeline. His controversial comments on the Chiefs-refs conspiracy theory this postseason became the most headlined topic. Kelce criticized the NFL media for ""leaning into the whole ref thing"" during Kansas City's run to the Super Bowl, as Kansas City drew a series of calls that kept it winning in playoff games.ESPN analyst Pat McAfee said he thought Kelce was too polite to the media and let the reader wonder what he might really want to say. “Travis always tries to keep it positive,” McAfee said on his show on Tuesday. “But he was just like, ‘Hey media, the f---?’”“Like this is allowed to be an internet thing, but to actually start promoting this is absurd,” continued McAfee. “And I know that refs stink, so there’s going to be situations where maybe there’s a time like, ‘Hey, this ref’s daughter, massive Swiftie.’ And maybe that’s going to happen, and hopefully they get to the bottom of it. But I appreciate Travis just being like, ‘Yo, come on. Let’s use our brains here.’ The amount of people that have to keep this secret would be impossible.”NFL and Chiefs executives have attacked the viral narrative of Kansas City getting a friendly whistle on Super Bowl opening night, but the heated controversy is likely to persist.

Jalen Hurts Says Eagles’ Super Bowl Loss to Chiefs 'Lit a Fire' in Him for Redemption



Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts is set to make his second Super Bowl appearance in just three seasons. The young quarterback came agonizingly close to glory in Super Bowl 57 , delivering an outstanding performance before falling short against the Kansas City Chiefs in a 38-35 thriller. Now, as he prepares to take center stage once again, Hurts is fueled by past heartbreak and determined to turn lessons into triumph.Jalen Hurts' journey back to the Super Bowl has been defined by resilience and an insatiable hunger for success. Reflecting on the Eagles’ loss to the Chiefs two years ago, he admitted that the experience has shaped him into a better player. Speaking during Super Bowl Opening Night, he shared how the painful defeat became a source of motivation:""I've learned so much. It's the same as any other game and, you know, I think the moments are the moments. But ultimately, you know, every game has its lessons -- good, bad or indifferent. So, just being able to become wiser, grow and mature and take all these lessons in for the next season and the next games. It's had a great driving force. It lit a flame, lit a fire in me, and to have this opportunity again is exactly what you work for.""This fire has been evident throughout the season, as Hurts and the Eagles silenced critics and stormed back into championship contention. After a rough 2023 campaign, Philadelphia responded in dominant fashion, winning 14 regular-season games and setting a record for the most points in a conference title game with a commanding 55-23 victory over the Washington Commanders. The resurgence has been fueled by Hurts’ leadership and his relentless pursuit of excellence.Hurts has always been known for his level-headed approach, but the quarterback believes he has grown significantly since his last Super Bowl appearance. He acknowledged that experience and time have played key roles in shaping him both as a player and as a leader.""Just the growth and the time. Every day there's a new lesson and a learning opportunity. I'm a more mature person and a better leader. All of these things, I've been able to push the threshold of [through] my entire career.""His leadership will be crucial as he looks to overcome a formidable Kansas City defense that has allowed just 414 passing yards in two playoff games. The Eagles boast a talented roster around him, but ultimately, the weight of expectation rests heavily on Hurts’ shoulders. He understands that success isn't about silencing doubters but rather about trusting the work that has been put in.""This is not about them, it's about the work you put in and everything [in a game] is a reflection of that work. I've always had a focus on myself and trying to improve, and ultimately beating whoever's in front of you.""For Hurts, this opportunity is more than just another game—it’s a shot at cementing his place in NFL history. At 26, he has already proven his ability to perform on the biggest stage, but a Super Bowl win would elevate him into the league’s elite quarterbacks. As he put it himself, the chance to chase greatness is everything.""It means everything. To have an opportunity to pursue whatever it is you're passionate about, whatever it is you love, it's very important.""Also Read: Who will Tom Brady root for in the Super Bowl?

Chiefs Owner Claps Back at Referee Favoritism Accusations



The debate over NFL officiating has taken center stage ahead of the Kansas City Chiefs ' Super Bowl matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles. Once dismissed as baseless conspiracy talk, claims of the Chiefs receiving favorable calls have gained traction, dominating discussions during media week. With little actual football to analyze, the ""rigged"" narrative has become a talking point, despite lacking concrete evidence. Chiefs owner Clark Hunt firmly denied the speculation.With the Kansas City Chiefs on the verge of an unprecedented third consecutive Super Bowl victory, accusations of referee favoritism have emerged as a recurring narrative. However, Chiefs owner Clark Hunt has outright dismissed such theories, calling them nothing more than excuses from those unwilling to acknowledge the team’s well-earned success.Speaking to The Insiders on NFL Network, Hunt made it clear that any claims suggesting the league or officials have conspired to aid the Chiefs are baseless. “You almost have to laugh at it,” Hunt remarked, emphasizing that every team in the league is striving to win under fair competition. He further defended NFL referees, stating, “The referees are doing the best job they can. If you look at the stats, there are a lot of stats that show we've been on the wrong side of calls as often as we've been on the right side.”""There’s definitely no conspiracy, right? It’s the nature of the game. And when you start having a lot of success, people like to start making excuses for why you’re having the success.""Hunt’s comments arrive amidst heightened scrutiny following the AFC Championship game , where the Chiefs' victory over the Buffalo Bills reignited debates over officiating. Two specific plays fueled the controversy—Josh Allen’s fourth-down QB sneak, where some fans questioned whether he had been stopped short, and Xavier Worthy’s contested reception against Bills safety Cole Bishop, which had critics claiming Bishop had a firm grip on the ball. These moments led many to cry foul, but Hunt insists that the Chiefs' success has nothing to do with officiating and everything to do with execution.The notion of a league-wide conspiracy in favor of the Chiefs has not only been dismissed by Hunt but also by those directly involved in officiating. Scott Green, the executive director of the NFL Referees Association, responded to these claims with strong words, highlighting the logistical absurdity of such accusations. “Officiating crews do not work the same team more than twice in regular season,” Green stated via Good Morning Football’s Peter Schrager. “It is insulting and preposterous to hear conspiracy theories that 17 officiating crews consisting of 138 officials are colluding to assist one team.”Green’s comments underline the randomness of officiating assignments, making it virtually impossible for any organized favoritism to take place. Yet, the narrative persists, largely fueled by the Chiefs’ ability to win close games and make clutch plays when it matters most. Over the years, the team has executed an extraordinary number of 50-50 plays, which has led some to mistakenly equate their success with officiating bias.While officiating controversies dominate headlines, the true reason behind the Chiefs’ sustained dominance lies in their quarterback, Patrick Mahomes. Time and again, Mahomes has delivered in high-pressure moments, elevating his team with remarkable poise and playmaking ability. With the Chiefs now one win away from a third straight Super Bowl title, Mahomes' postseason performances remain a major driving force.Hunt acknowledged the historic nature of this Super Bowl run, recognizing what’s at stake. “Any opportunity you have to play in the Super Bowl is always special. Obviously, this year has a little bit more to it because we have a chance to make history,” he said. He credited head coach Andy Reid for keeping the team focused and ensuring they approached each game with the same level of intensity. “Coach Reid has done a great job of keeping the guys focused because you don’t get here unless you pay attention each week, take that week's opponent as seriously as you can and play your best football.”Also Read: Will Taylor Swift's dad ditch Travis Kelce and support the Eagles during the Super Bowl LIX? The Chiefs’ TE gave a head-turning answer As the Chiefs prepare to face the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LIX on February 9, the scrutiny surrounding officiating is unlikely to subside. Every call—or non-call—will be dissected in real-time, adding to the tension of an already high-stakes showdown. Yet, as Hunt and the Chiefs have maintained, their success isn’t the result of external factors but rather their relentless commitment to excellence. Whether they cement their place in history with a third straight Super Bowl victory will ultimately come down to what happens on the field—not in the referee’s whistle.","Chiefs owner Clark Hunt dismisses claims of referee favoritism.

Tom Brady reveals whom he will be rooting for in the Chiefs-Eagles Super Bowl

Tom Brady thinks the Philadelphia Eagles have a good chance of winning Super Bowl LIX, but the Kansas City Chiefs are going for history. The Chiefs, with Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce at the helm, could be the first team to win three Super Bowls in a row after defeating the Eagles 38-35 in 2023. Although the Eagles lost to the Chiefs in 2023, Brady believes they can get revenge if Jalen Hurts continues his strong play under center.Tom Brady will call his first Super Bowl in New Orleans, making history if the Kansas City Chiefs win the three-peat. Brady, who missed the NFL's record two decades ago, may not want to see the Chiefs achieve what he could never do.Brady, who has no jealousy towards the AFC champs, having defeated Patrick Mahomes twice in the postseason, said he does not have a favorite team in the big game but is happy if the Chiefs win their third consecutive Lombardi Trophy.“Well, I’m broadcasting the game, so I don’t really have a rooting interest per se,” Brady said on the Let’s Go! podcast. “The only thing I root for in these situations are great games. I will say if the Chiefs win, I will be very happy for them. I mean, what they’ve achieved is unmatched.”Brady went on to describe similarities between his former team’s dynasty and that of the Chiefs. “I think that’s cool because people always hated on us for so many years. And I didn’t understand it because all I did was like, we try to do things the right way, we try to go out there and compete for our job and win,” continued Brady.He further added, “And there’s an excellence that I appreciate about people who are doing other things at really high levels because you understand the commitment that it takes for them to do what they’re doing. And to be in this country and to not cheer for excellence is beyond me.”Although the Eagles came up short against the Chiefs in 2023, Brady believes they can get revenge if Jalen Hurts continues his strong play under center. ""The running game has been there all year. That's consistent,"" Brady said.""AJ Brown getting open in man coverage or DeVonta Smith, that's consistent. Goddard is consistent. The line blocking well, that's consistent.

Is Travis Kelce Planning a Super Bowl Proposal for Taylor Swift?



With the Super Bowl just days away, speculation is swirling not only about championship rings but also about a possible engagement ring. Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce , 35, added fuel to the fire when asked during the Super Bowl’s opening night in New Orleans on February 3 whether he planned to propose to Taylor Swift at the big game. Instead of shutting down the rumors, Kelce simply smiled coyly, keeping fans guessing.Travis Kelce found himself in the hot seat during Super Bowl LIX’s opening night in New Orleans, not just about football but about his high-profile relationship with Taylor Swift. With the global pop sensation expected to support him at the Caesars Superdome, the conversation naturally veered toward the possibility of an engagement.However, Kelce swiftly deflected any talk of popping the question. When asked directly whether he planned to give anyone a special ring, the Chiefs star quipped, “A Super Bowl ring? Next question.” Pressed again on the matter, he chuckled and responded, “Man, back-to-back, you guys are crazy. Wouldn’t you like to know?” The exchange, though brief, was enough to spark further speculation among fans.While he avoided discussing a potential proposal, Kelce had no problem speaking about Swift in other contexts. He praised her relentless work ethic and even gave a playful nod to her homemade pop tarts. “If she’s out here being the superstar she is, never taking no for an answer, and always working her tail off, I better match that energy for sure,” Kelce said. His words reflected the mutual admiration between the couple, who have been inseparable since going public with their relationship in 2023.Swift has become a frequent presence at Chiefs games, most recently seen cheering for Kelce during the AFC divisional-round victory against the Buffalo Bills. Her schedule, now free from the 2024 leg of her record-breaking Eras Tour, makes it highly likely she will be in the stands when the Chiefs face off against the Philadelphia Eagles on February 9.Beyond the football field, Swift has continued to make waves. Just a day before Super Bowl Media Day, she attended the 2025 Grammys in a striking Chiefs-red dress adorned with a subtle “T” charm. Although she left the ceremony without a win from her six nominations, she still managed to steal the spotlight with viral moments, including snagging Janelle Monáe’s jacket and sharing a dance with Alicia Keys' son Genesis.Also Read: Travis Kelce Shuts Down the Media After Having Enough of Referee Questions!

Travis Kelce opens up about the drug scandal

Chiefs TE Travis Kelce speaks at Super Bowl LIX opening night

It was rampant with rumors within the NFL world about Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce being arrested on drug charges, but on closer examination, those rumors disproved since there is no factual basis to support them. The phrase Travis Kelce Arrested on Drug Charges began trending across various social media platforms, and fans and critics began speculating about its validity. Some posts said that the NFL star was caught in possession of large quantities of marijuana, while others said he was detained in Las Vegas after a drug-related altercation.Travis Kelce has a dark chapter in his history that almost ended his football career before it could even start. Kelce spoke about the 2010 NCAA drug scandal that ended up suspending him from the University of Cincinnati football team as he appeared during Super Bowl Opening Night in New Orleans. Kelce, having earned a spot on the roster and changing his life, made an impact with his family by showing himself to be willing to confront his past mistakes.""I think it was a very emotional and meaningful thing that happened to me back in college, and I brought that all on myself,"" Kelce admitted. ""I think it was just me not living up to my family's expectations, and that was probably the biggest thing. Bringing negativity to them was probably the hardest part for me.”In 2010, Kelce was suspended for failing a marijuana drug test in New Orleans before the Sugar Bowl, causing uncertainty for his future in football, despite being considered a promising young talent for the Cincinnati Bearcats. Kelce, who shared his experience as a wake-up call on the Bussin' With the Boys podcast in 2023, has been transparent about the occurrence.""I partied a little too much down there [New Orleans], got hit with a drug test, and from that point on, I realized I've got to tighten the f** up,"" he said. Kelce interviewed his former college roommate, Zach Collaros, who shared a humorous and touching story about a specific period in his life. ""My mom visited one time when Travis was suspended. She doesn't like going to games, so she just stayed behind and cleaned the house,"" Collaros recalled.He added, ""She smelled something and walked downstairs in the basement, and it's Trav-smoking a joint. She goes, 'Travis, aren't you suspended for this?!?' And he just says, 'Hey Momma Collaros, it's all right. When are we going to the game?' And they walked to the game together.”Kelce later confirmed the story on his New Heights podcast, laughing about how wild those days were. ""I made sure to tell them, don't hold back-tell all the good stories. And sure enough, they mentioned all the really good ones, like Zach's mom walking in on me firing up in the garage before one of the games. Absolutely hilarious. That's how I was living back then,"" he noted.Also Read: “Find a way to get into another career”: Travis Kelce opens up on where he plans to be in three years",Travis Kelce was suspended from the University of Cincinnati football team in 2010 for failing a marijuana drug test.

Aaron Donald continues to give Tom Brady nightmares

Before he calls his first Super Bowl next week for FOX , Tom Brady talked about his experiences playing in the big game and named Los Angeles Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald as the toughest defender he faced in a Super Bowl. In Brady's final Super Bowl, the New England Patriots defeated Donald and the Rams, despite a 13-point win, making it the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in history, focusing on controlling Donald's impact and controlling his offensive game plan.Tom Brady may go down in the record books as the greatest ever quarterback, but Aaron Donald continues to give Brady nightmares about some of his otherworldly techniques. Former quarterback of the New England Patriots who now comments on Fox Sports came on FS1's The Herd with Colin Cowherd, and, in anticipation of calling his very first Super Bowl next week.""There's one guy late in my career who I went against who every time we played him he was an absolute nuisance,"" Brady said of Donald. ""I didn't get him very often, in fact he got me a lot. He beat me a lot, but in the Super Bowl in 2018 against the Rams, we faced Aaron Donald. We actually limited his ability to make a lot of plays in that game because we had a lot of double teams.”Brady continued, ""Every single play, run, pass, including pass protection, was designed to keep him out of the backfield and keep him from making negative plays. Now, he didn't make many negative plays, and at the same time, we only scored 13 points in the game.”He further added, “It was one of the hardest games and biggest challenges I ever faced because he forced us to do so many things that we didn't necessarily want to do from a game plan standpoint. Even though we limited his ability to impact the game on the stat sheet, it affected our ability to score points. Thank God our defense played so great or we wouldn't have won the game.”Super Bowl LIII was the lowest-scoring Super Bowl ever, with the Patriots scoring just 13 points against Wade Phillips' defense.

""Outside of showing their usual interest in LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Warriors have also held conversations with the Phoenix Suns about just how available Kevin Durant is.""

Will Kevin Durant be open to the Golden State Warriors trade desires?



Can the Golden State Warriors pull off this blockbuster trade for Kevin Durant?



Theare making a serious effort to landin a potential blockbuster trade, hoping to reunite him with Stephen Curry and strengthen their championship aspirations. While the Phoenix Suns have reportedly shut down talks of Durant being available before the Feb. 6 trade deadline, the Warriors' front office remains persistent in its pursuit.Golden State’s recent 104-99 victory over the Orlando Magic improved their season record to 25-24. While the win was crucial, it also highlighted a key issue—the lack of a reliable second-scoring option alongside Curry. The team managed to grind out a defensive battle against one of the league’s best defensive squads, but the narrow margin exposed the need for more firepower.With Curry now 36 years old, Golden State Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy appears determined to give the franchise’s all-time leading scorer the support he needs. As reported by ClutchPoints' Brett Siegel,Despite the Golden State Warriors ' interest, Phoenix has been quick to dismiss any speculation about trading Kevin Durant. However, the Suns have unexpectedly become a focal point in league-wide trade discussions. Golden State understands that acquiring Durant would require a significant trade package, but given their past success with him, the front office remains willing to explore all options.Durant previously played a crucial role in Golden State’s dynasty from 2016 to 2019, appearing in three consecutive NBA Finals and securing two championships alongside Curry. His return would immediately restore the Warriors’ status as title contenders, making the potential trade an enticing opportunity for both the team and its fanbase.Although Phoenix has turned down any trade speculation, the Warriors' aggressive approach suggests they will keep pushing for a deal until the deadline. While the odds may not be in their favor, the pursuit of Durant signals Golden State’s commitment to maximizing Curry’s championship window.Also read: NBA Trade Rumor: Los Angeles Lakers eye $48 million Warriors duo following blockbuster Luka Doncic trade For now, the Warriors continue to battle through the Western Conference with their current roster, but their front office remains on high alert, hoping for any opportunity to bring Durant back into the fold.","Golden State Warriors have held talks with the Phoenix Suns about Kevin Durant.

is listed as “probable” with a foot injury ahead of the team's matchup against the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday, February 4, at Intuit Dome. The Lakers, currently holding a 28-19 record, have been dealing with multiple injury setbacks, with six players on their injury report.Alongside LeBron James , the Los Angeles Lakers have Christian Wood (knee), Luka Doncic (calf), and Maxi Kleber (foot) ruled out for the game. Additionally, Cameron Reddish (personal) is listed as day-to-day, while Gabe Vincent (knee) is questionable to play. Despite these setbacks, James has been a dominant force for the Lakers this season, averaging 24.6 points, 6.8 rebounds, and 8.7 assists over the last 20 games.The Lakers have struggled on the boards, ranking 28th in the league in rebounds per game (41.4), a concern as they prepare to face the Clippers, who rank 14th in that category (44.5 RPG). LeBron James remains their most reliable rebounder, averaging 7.6 rebounds per game, but the team will need a collective effort against a Clippers squad that features Ivica Zubac (12.7 RPG, fourth in the NBA).The Clippers, with a 28-21 record, have fewer injury concerns, with Nicolas Batum (illness) and Cam Christie (ankle) ruled out. Led by LeBron James Harden (18.8 PPG, 7.9 APG) and Norman Powell (21.9 PPG, 2.6 3PM), the Clippers have a solid offensive core. They average 110.3 points per game (23rd in the NBA) but have been efficient defensively, allowing just 107.2 PPG (third in the league).With James listed as probable, it is likely he will suit up against the Clippers, but his performance could be impacted by his foot issue. The Los Angeles Lakers will rely on Austin Reaves (19.7 PPG, 7.3 APG) to provide additional scoring support, especially if James is limited in any capacity.Also read: Will Luka Doncic play tonight against the LA Clippers?

What is the update on Roman Reigns for Elimination Chamber following the assault at the WWE Royal Rumble 2025 event?



Is WWE building towards a Roman Reigns vs Seth Rollins match at WrestleMania 41?



A new update has emerged on Roman Reigns ’ status, moving forward on the road to WrestleMania 41 following the aftermath of the Royal Rumble 2025 event.Roman Reigns’ night at the 2025 Royal Rumble event was far from how he had expected it to be. The OTC was a part of the Men’s Royal Rumble match, entering the match at #16 and displaying a spectacular performance. Yet, it was a painful night for Reigns as an old foe decimated him and left him laid out.In a dramatic sequence in the match, the fans erupted at the sight of Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins sharing a moment. After CM Punk eliminated the duo, Rollins snapped and laid out Reigns with multiple stomps, including one on the steel steps.During the February 3rd edition of Monday Night RAW on Netflix, Michael Cole made an announcement that he had received some updates regarding Roman Reigns’ health following the WWE Royal Rumble 2025 event. Cole stated that he only had the information that Reigns permitted to share with the fans.Closing on his statement, Cole announced that Roman Reigns will out of action for the foreseeable future. This could mean that he will most likely miss out on WWE’s last Premium Live Event before WrestleMania 41, Elimination Chamber, which is set to take place in Toronto, Canada on March 1st.Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins have a long and storied rivalry. The duo came to WWE together in 2012 as part of the popular faction, The Shield. The animosity began when Rollins turned his back on the group and broke up the faction in 2014. Since then, the duo have collided against each other on multiple occasions, each of which has been a blockbuster.Moreover, the cinematic moment between Rollins and Reigns at the Royal Rumble event last week led the fans in the Lucas Oil Stadium to erupt. Rollins attacking Reigns was perceived as the early seeds planted for this rivalry. Following that, The Visionary took credit for taking out Reigns on the fallout edition of RAW.With the events that transpired since the Royal Rumble event, it seems that WWE is building towards a Roman Reigns vs Seth Rollins match for WrestleMania 41. So we will have to wait and see what happens when WWE reaches Las Vegas for The Show of Shows.Also read: Is This the Greatest Royal Rumble of All Time?

Kyrie Irving (shoulder), P.J. Washington (knee), and Daniel Gafford (ankle) are all day-to-day, while Dereck Lively (ankle), Dwight Powell (hip), and Anthony Davis (foot) are ruled out.

Los Angeles Lakers injury report for the game against the LA Clippers (February 4, 2025)



Luka Doncic’s Impact on the Los Angeles Lakers’ performance



LA Clippers look to take advantage tonight against the Los Angeles Lakers (February 4, 2025{)

When and where to watch tonight’s game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the LA Clippers (February 4, 2025)

has been ruled out for the team's upcoming game against the Los Angeles Clippers due to a calf injury. The marquee matchup, set to take place at Intuit Dome on February 4, will now see the Lakers without one of their key playmakers as they battle their cross-town rivals. Luka Doncic is one of six Los Angeles Lakers players currently listed on the injury report. Alongside him, Christian Wood (knee) and Maxi Kleber (foot) have also been ruled out, while LeBron James is listed as probable with a foot injury. Additionally, Cameron Reddish remains day-to-day for personal reasons, and Gabe Vincent is questionable with a knee issue.Doncic’s absence is a major blow for the Lakers, who rely on his playmaking and scoring ability. With the team already struggling to find consistency, missing a player of his caliber could make their task even tougher against a Clippers squad looking to gain ground in the Western Conference standings.Without Luka Doncic, the Lakers will need others to step up. LeBron James , who is averaging 24.6 points, 6.8 rebounds, and 8.7 assists over the last 20 games, will likely shoulder more of the offensive load. Austin Reaves, averaging 19.7 points per game, could also see an increased role.The Los Angeles Lakers currently sit 17th in the league in scoring, putting up 112.2 points per game, while their defense ranks 12th, allowing 112.3 points per contest. Their rebounding struggles continue, as they rank 28th in the NBA with just 41.4 boards per game. The absence of Luka Doncic, a solid rebounder and facilitator, only exacerbates this issue.The Clippers, who enter the game with a 28-21 record, have fewer injury concerns. They will be without Nicolas Batum (illness) and Cam Christie (ankle), but their core remains intact. James Harden (18.8 PPG, 7.9 APG) and Ivica Zubac (14.1 PPG, 11.8 RPG) have been key contributors, and Norman Powell has provided a scoring spark off the bench with 21.9 points per game.Currently ranking third in the NBA in points allowed per game (107.2), the Clippers’ defense could make things even more difficult for the short-handed Lakers.The Lakers will need to rely on their depth and seasoned leadership as they get through this phase without Doncic. Every game matters as the Western Conference standings become closer, so they'll need to figure out how to remain competitive even without important players.Also read: Will LeBron James play tonight against the LA Clippers?

Austin Ekeler thrashed the Giants for their baffling decision of letting Saquon Barkley go,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/what-a-joke-letting-that-guy-go-commanders-rb-austin-ekeler-thrashed-the-giants-for-their-baffling-decision-of-letting-saquon-barkley-go/articleshow/117897990.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

Austin Ekeler labeled the Giants' decision to let Saquon Barkley go as ""a joke”

New York Giants fans finally saw an end to the 3-14 season, but losing running back Saquon Barkley to the Philadelphia Eagles is the added insult to injury. Barkley's 60-yard run on Philadelphia's first play from scrimmage set the tone for the rout, ensuring New York would have two more weeks of discourse, none of which has been kind to the Giants, as they dismantled the Washington Commanders 55-23.Piling on was Commanders running back Austin Ekeler , who called out general manager Joe Schoen for his brutal Barkley decision.The New York Giants' decision to let Saquon Barkley walk in free agency last offseason, despite his position, has left the team haunted. Barkley later signed with the Philadelphia Eagles on a three-year, $37.75 million deal, proving the Giants' mistake. Barkley's experience with the Eagles highlights the importance of re-signing players.Barkley's first season as an Eagle was his best yet, as he became the ninth player in NFL history to rush for 2,000 yards in a season. He helped the Eagles reach the Super Bowl for the second time in three years. This postseason, he rushed for 442 yards and scored five touchdowns.Barkley's games for the Eagles had incurred weekly criticism of the Giants. Commanders running back Austin Ekeler lost to Barkley and the Eagles in the NFC championship game. He labeled the Giants' decision as ""a joke.”""It's really cool to see, especially the guys that were getting shuffled around, and 'oh I don't know if these guys can still play or if they'll make an impact.’ Like the Giants, what a joke letting that guy go.” Ekeler joked, ""Prime Saquon, 'I don't know who's gonna pay this guy $12 million dollars.' Well, he's gonna carry your offense. So, everybody. Don't get me started there.”Barkley, the key player for the Eagles, has been a stand-out player on the field with the best performance in every game he has played, though not a key part of New York's offense in recent seasons. Barkley's season has caused more controversy for the Giants than the Tennessee Titans' departure of Derrick Henry or the Las Vegas Raiders' departure of Josh Jacobs, both of whom achieved success with their former teams.Also Read: “Still the GOAT”: J.J. Watt weighs in on the ongoing debate over who among Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady holds the GOAT title Giants fans anticipate Barkley's Super Bowl performance against Kansas City Chiefs to end his reign of terror, allowing a new offseason to establish storylines and reshape New York's perception.","The New York Giants let running back Saquon Barkley walk in free agency.

Bucks Trade Scenario Involves Acquiring Martin Brothers for Defensive Boost

Milwaukee Bucks are looking to improve their perimeter defense and are secretly negotiating a trade for Caleb and Cody Martin , the twin brothers. The reports, from Marc Stein and Jake Fischer, indicate that the Bucks are considering both of the Martins, whose salaries would be cheaper than that of Pat Connaughton 's $9.4 million, in return for a deal that would send Connaughton.Forward for the Philadelphia 76ers, 6'5"" Caleb Martin has been playing up to snuff this season. He is averaging 9.1 points, 4.4 rebounds and 2.2 assists per game. He’s proven to be a trusted scorer at a shooting percentage of 43.5%. He’s taken on his role at that end of the floor across 31 games, averaging around 30.4 minutes per game.Forward Cody Martin, 6'6"", has been the rocks for a passing Charlotte Hornets team all season long. In 70 games with the MAGIC, he is averaging 7.8 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game. He’s been a man of dependable shooting percentage of 43.3%. He has averaged around 24.8 minutes on the court over 39 games and has been a vital player in the team’s setup over 39 games.The Bucks, within the context of getting more players who can help provide some much needed defense on the wings, are looking at the Martin brothers. The guys are fantastic defensively and can adapt, and that’s exactly what the team needs. Plus, their contracts are very friendly, so they are probably worth getting a trade for.One trade idea floating around is the Bucks acquiring Cody Martin and Nick Richards from the Charlotte Hornets, with Luke Kennard and MarJon Beauchamp heading to Charlotte. The Bucks would strengthen their defensive game and the Hornets would get much needed shooting skills with this swap.With the trade deadline looming, the Milwaukee Bucks are seeking to add more to its roster. To really help their championship aspirations, adding either Caleb or Cody Martin would help greatly to add depth and boost the defense. The fans eagerly can watch how the trade talks play out in the coming days.Also Read : NBA Trade Rumor: Los Angeles Lakers eye blockbuster 3-way trade for $151 million star trio after shocking Anthony Davis move","Milwaukee Bucks are looking to improve their perimeter defense and are secretly negotiating a trade for Caleb and Cody Martin, the twin brothers.

Final Thoughts—Goedert’s Got Bigger Things to Worry About

You Belong with Me

Super Bowl week is usually about game plans, matchups, and intense strategy talk, but Philadelphia Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert had social media in stitches for a completely different reason—heerased Taylor Swift from his pop culture memory. During Super Bowl LIX Opening Night, a reporter asked Goedert about Swift and to everyone’s shock the player doesn't know any of her songs.During Super Bowl LIX Opening Night, a reporter asked Goedert about Swift, given her high-profile relationship with Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce . Instead of playing along, Goedert hilariously shot back:Cue the collective facepalm. That song isn’t Taylor Swift—it’s TLC’s 1995 hit. And just like that, the internet had a new favorite Super Bowl moment.Despite acknowledging that Swift is an, Goedert admitted she’s nowhere near his playlist.Instead, he name-dropped Meek Mill and Kendrick Lamar as his go-to artists. And honestly, fair enough—the man prefersoverHis musical taste makes sense, given that Meek Mill is practically the soundtrack of Philly sports. But still, misidentifying one of the biggest artists in the world? That’s bold.As expected, Swifties wasted no time roasting Goedert for the blunder:Even non-Swifties found it hilarious, with many pointing out how out of touch NFL players can be with pop culture when they’re laser-focused on the game.The timing of Goedert’s comments is what makes them even funnier. Swift has been a major storyline throughout the NFL season, with her appearances at Chiefs games sparking constant media attention. And now? A Super Bowl player doesn’t even know her music.The irony is justgood.While this viral moment is pure gold, Dallas Goedert probably doesn’t care much. He’s locked in on winning the Super Bowl, and let’s be honest—he won’t be singingin the locker room anytime soon.But after this? Maybe it’s time for a Taylor Swift crash course—just in case another reporter decides to test his pop culture knowledge.Because next time? He might not shake it off so easily.Also read - Travis Kelce Shuts Down the Media After Having Enough of Referee Questions!",Philadelphia Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert doesn't know any of Taylor Swift's songs.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

Rohit Sharma's batting in ODIs has been game changing: Shubman Gill

NEW DELHI: India's vice-captain Shubman Gill on Tuesday defended Team India following their Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) series loss, stating that one match or one bad single day does not define the team’s capabilities.India experienced their first series loss in ten years of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, falling to Australia with a 1-3 scoreline in the five-match contest.The squad will see the comeback of key players including Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant, and Gill for the upcoming three-match ODI series against England, followed by the all-important ICC Champions Trophy with India matches slated to be held in Dubai.""One series does not define the form of the whole team. There are a lot of players who, in the past, have performed consistently in a lot of series and tournaments,"" Gill told mediapersons in Nagpur ahead of the first ODI against England.""Definitely, we did not play as per our expectations in the Australian series, but still we played some good cricket . We were unfortunate not to have (Jasprit) Bumrah on the last day and we would have won the match and the series would have been a draw and this talk wouldn't have happened.""One match and one day doesn't define us, we won there twice before and earlier won a World Cup and then reached the final of a World Cup, so we should keep all those things in mind.""The selection of Gill as the team's vice-captain became one of the major talking points as Team India announced its squad for the England series and 2025 ICC Champions Trophy.Addressing the media during the squad reveal, chief selector Ajit Agarkar shed light on this significant decision.“Gill has been vice-captain in Sri Lanka as well,” Agarkar stated. “You always want to be on the lookout for leaders. I won't look into it much but a lot of the feedback for these decisions comes from the dressing room.”At 25, Gill has already established himself as one of India’s premier batsmen across all formats, having amassed 2328 one-day international (ODI) runs in 47 innings with an average of 58.20.With his average backing his potential, Gill has emerged as a natural leader on and off the field, making him a fitting deputy to captain Rohit Sharma.India begin their Champions Trophy campaign on February 20 against Bangladesh, followed by high-octane clashes against Pakistan (February 23) and New Zealand (March 2).","India's vice-captain Shubman Gill defended Team India following their Border- Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) series loss.

The Eagles' attitude this time is significantly different from their previous Super Bowl performance

The Eagles are entering Super Bowl 2025 with a focused, business-like mindset. The team emphasized that their goal is to win, not to have fun. The team is determined to overcome the Chiefs, whom they’ve struggled against in recent years, including a loss in the 2023 season.The Eagles’ mindset this time is a sharp contrast to their previous Super Bowl appearance. After their loss to the Chiefs, they are coming in with a determined, business-first attitude, focused on securing the win. The Chiefs, on the other hand, have already established themselves as a dynasty, with a calm, experienced approach to the Super Bowl that has helped them succeed repeatedly.While the Eagles are treating the game more seriously this time, they hope their changed mentality will lead to a different, more successful result.The Eagles didn't blame lack of focus two years ago, but the Super Bowl distractions can be overwhelming. This time, they seem more prepared to stay focused and avoid getting sidetracked. ""All of this media stuff is cool, but none of this matters,"" A.J Brown said. ""It's all about the game.”“Focusing on us and kind of blocking you guys the media out, that's kind of been the focus all year,"" Mailata said. ""Making sure, as repetitive as it sounds, keeping the main thing the main thing.""In Super Bowl LVII, the Eagles gave the Chiefs a tough fight, with Jalen Hurts delivering one of his best performances. He led the Eagles to a tie with just over five minutes remaining. However, Patrick Mahomes showcased his clutch ability, leading the Chiefs on a long drive in the final minutes, setting up the game-winning score. Mahomes’ performance in crucial moments made the difference, securing the victory for Kansas City.""You can't really spend your time looking on the past. If you look behind you, you'll never go forward,"" defensive tackle Jordan Davis said. ""But obviously you want to learn from your mistakes.""We have another opportunity in front of our faces to rewrite a story that we have.""""As you go through any game in the NFL that you play, any game really that I've been coaching as you play, you think about the things that you did well, then you think about the things that you didn't do well and how you can improve on those things,"" Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni said.""That was something that we went through when we got back from the Super Bowl. Hey, here's what we did well, here's what we didn't do well, and you try to get better from those things. I won't get into the things that were changed through the daily organization of a Super Bowl week, but there's some things that we're doing a little bit different to try to get better from our last experience.""The Eagles’ Opening Night for the Super Bowl, like every other team before them, was filled with spectacle and fun moments. The players laughed at bizarre questions about Kendrick Lamar and quirky locker room habits. However, amidst the lightheartedness, they emphasized a more serious focus: this time, they’re determined to stay locked in on their goal of winning the Super Bowl.The reminder served not only for the media but perhaps as a mental checkpoint for the team itself, signaling their concentration on what’s ahead. ""It's being in the moment, being where your feet are at,"" Mailata said. ""Making sure we're not making the moment bigger than it is.""Also Read: “That's a ridiculous theory”: Rodger Goodell thrashed the theories of the Chiefs being favoured by the refs Despite the loss, Hurts' performance in the Super Bowl solidified his status as one of the top quarterbacks in the league, but Mahomes' clutch play and big-game experience once again proved why he's one of the best to ever do it.","The Eagles are entering Super Bowl 2025 with a focused, business-like mindset.

Sean Casey’s Hot Take: Comerica Park Might Turn Bregman Into a Ground Ball Machine



Jack Flaherty back w Tigers. Could Reds sign Pete Alonso? What do Verlander & Scherzer have left?

Alex Bregman - The Offseason's Most Tiresome Free Agent

Hold on to your baseball caps, ladies and gentlemen; former Major League star and now Tigers announcer Sean Casey just offered his strong opinion to Detroit fans about Alex Bregman . Casey feels Houston Astros ' third baseman might experience a ""terrible"" dip in offensive numbers if he were ever part of the Tigers. And not just any dip-a nose dive into the deep end.What is it about Comerica Park that warrants such a consideration? Why does Casey feel it would be so hard for Bregman to continue performing well in the Motor City? Well, it comes down to the configuration of the park. You know, the ""long"" outfield that turns simple fly balls into borderline heart attacks for hitters. Casey holds no punches. He says point-blank: ""Comerica Park? Great park to pitch in. Terrible park to hit in.""And he's done in this atmosphere, too. Casey's done his time in various ballparks and knows a country mile when he sees one. He recalls Jim Leyland, Tigers' manager, mentioning how a player did not hit home runs, to which Casey grinned in agreement over his next retort: ""Hey, you try hitting a ball to right-center at Comerica. It's like hitting a beach ball into a windstorm.""The commentary on right-center at Comerica? Well, it's one of those places with unusual weather. If he chokes a bit, by the time the ball lands, there will probably be a lot of adoring fans cheering in the stands. It is tough, finding the right spot, Casey says that Bregman will have a tough time with that kind of hitting.But then again, we all know how much of a great hitter Bregman is. He is certainly one of the best. He has a very clean swing and can hit the ball everywhere. But Comerica is a huge outfield. That type of hitter is not going to be helped by that. The notorious right-center depth is going to hurt Bregman's numbers, and Casey adds that has the potential to affect his overall offensive numbers big time.Dwelling on the far-off chance that Bregman could be acquired one day, Detroit fans might wonder what the stadium would do to affect his stats from the crafty side of left field in Houston. Look, maybe the Tigers are going to have to find another means of giving an injection to their offense because, with Bregman, it could just be that trying to fit a square peg into the round hole.Really the bottom line: Comerica may not be the right stop for Bregman to keep up with his eye-popping numbers. So should the Tigers really think about getting him, a lineup strategy revaluation may be in order before dreaming about homing in on glory.","Former Major League star and now Tigers announcer Sean Casey offered his strong opinion to Detroit fans about Alex Bregman.

Kristian Campbell , the second baseman/outfielder sensation whose climb was meteoric enough to cause many a stir and a few aches in the Boston camp.If you haven't heard about Campbell yet, better hang on! The 2024 Baseball America Minor League Player of the Year has been a monster in the minor leagues. And we do mean to say the young star does have a fan club that could rival a few of the bigger names in the game. When Campbell slashed .330/.439/.558, with 20 home runs and 32 doubles over three levels of minor league over the last season, the Sox were inclined to think, ""Maybe we don't really need to shell out our money on a star like Alex Bregman after all.And you can't fault them for thinking that. The buzz about Campbell is a tangible one. ""I can't wait to see this kid,"" said an insider within the camp. That pretty much encapsulates the buzz around Red Sox Nation . This kid is just someone who's been galloping through their system like a line drive off a Big Papi bat. But then again, there is this tiny little detail that gives them pause: 137 minor league games. Yes, that's it. Just 137 games. That's like putting a bet on your favorite minor league band to headline the Super Bowl halftime show after just a year in the gig-good shot, very risky. The second baseman/outfielder was a monster across three levels of minor league ball last season, slashing.And this is when it gets a little tougher in negotiations. Red Sox GM Chaim Bloom and newly appointed president of the team Craig Breslow carry a name for their caution, their methodical approach, and certainly will not make any rash decisions on Campbell. ""The Red Sox' faith in him being close is reassuring,"" said one scout, but it brings warnings against pushing the young star too soon. ""I hope their enthusiasm doesn't lead to rushing him."" After all, the last thing the Sox want is a bust of a season from jumping the gun on Campbell's development.But notwithstanding, the downside here? I mean, he's either got another year-plus hammering in the minors or he'll loaf around as a backup while Boston gets Bregman to anchor the infield. Having both would be the best situation possible. Yes, it would be quite an investment for Bregman, but with the upside of Campbell, that potential mix between proven talent and exciting prospects could just make sense for the Red Sox.Is Campbell going to deliver? And is Bregman likely to be signing on with the Red Sox fairly soon? Only time will tell; however, this is possibly going to be the most exciting Spring Training for the Sox in many years. Keep your fingers crossed, baseball fans.","Kristian Campbell is the 2024 Baseball America Minor League Player of the Year.

How Scott Boras has influenced Alex Bregman’s involvement with the NY Mets?

“He also has Boras as his agent and I am not suggesting that this is the case, but if I am Scott Boras, why would I want the Mets involved with Alex Bregman because that would eliminate them in theory from Pete Alonso.”

“So one less suiters for Alonso. Meanwhile Bregman already has these potential suiters. So there's a couple of reasons, from the real part of it and then there's my speculation as well as to that it also doesn't make sense from the player's side.”

Will the Toronto Blue Jays open the doors for Alex Bregman and Pete Alonso?

""The Blue Jays have offers for Pete Alonso (three years) and Alex Bregman (six years). The Jays are interested in signing either of them,""

Devin Booker made history Monday night, becoming the Phoenix Suns ’ all-time leading scorer during their game against the Portland Trail Blazers. By surpassing Walter Davis ’ franchise record of 15,666 points, Booker secured his place among the Suns’ greats. Proud father Melvin Booker has shared a heartfelt message after his son’s record-beaking achievement while remembering one of the all-time greats, Kobe Bryant Devin Booker has created a lasting impression on the Phoenix Suns. Certainly, he has been one of the star players for the team and it is no cakewalk to claim the 15,666 points— a franchise record that would be hard for many to break.Reflecting on Booker's loyalty to the Suns, Melvin couldn’t help but think of Kobe Bryant . Booker's commitment to one franchise, much like Bryant’s with the Lakers, stood out in an era of constant player movement. “That’s something he always said. He always wanted to stay here. Kobe had a big influence on him. Kobe played with one franchise. I hope we can pull that off and do the same thing here,” Melvin shared.Melvin further shared that his son, Booker is following the the footsteps of the late NBA legend who has spent the entire twenty years of his career with the Los Angeles Lakers. Booker is also expected to do the same, at least, according to his father.It’s no easy feat to achieve and Booker knows that but he has spent 10 years of his career with the Suns. Reflecting on his record-breaking achievement, he let his feelings known during the post-game interview. ""It means everything,"" Booker said. ""Just being drafted to a franchise that believed in me, taking a chance on me as an 18-year-old kid and going through a rebuild phase and just sticking with it. Keeping my head down. The love and support has always been there. I don't take it from granted,” he added.Like his father’s statement, Booker also asserted his loyalty to the Suns adding “I take it seriously putting 'Phoenix' across my chest.""Suns head coach Mike Budenholzer has also responded to Booker’s record. “What a great accomplishment for a great player, for a great human. Think his teammates, the organization, the city, all of us are just thankful grateful for his greatness. He’s one of the greats, maybe the all-time great Phoenix Sun,” Budenholzer said of the Suns' star player.Also Read: Anthony Davis shares first reaction after shocking trade sends him from Lakers to Mavericks: “Every great story has an exciting next chapter” The 28-year-old guard has been in his A-game this season averaging 26.1 points per game, 4.0 rebounds, 6.7 assists, and 45.1 field goal percentage. A first-round pick out of Kentucky in 2015, Devin Booker has already built an impressive career. With multiple All-NBA selections and four All-Star appearances, he’s long been one of the league’s top scorers.","Devin Booker made history Monday night, becoming the Phoenix Suns ’ all-time leading scorer during their game against the Portland Trail Blazers.

KOLKATA: Jamshedpur FC coach Khalid Jamil achieved an Indian Super League first 'double' over the weekend, when he became the first head coach — and also, the first Indian — to score a league double over Manolo Marquez , the FC Goa and current India coach. On Sunday, Jamil's Jamshedpur beat the Goans 3-1. In their away fixture in September last year, Khalid's men had won 2-1, their first game of the season.""All the credit goes to the players. They are working very hard and are motivated. They knew that the game was important and I just told them to give their best and play their natural game,"" Jamil told the broadcasters' post-match interview afterwards.Jamil corners a fair share of the credit as well. This is not the first time that he has been successful in ISL. In the 2020-21 season, he guided North East United FC to the playoffs — also a first by an Indian coach. This time, Jamshedpur have reached the second spot since they won the Shield under Owen Coyle in 2021-22. Furthermore, at home this season they have been unbeaten in nine of their ten games.On what this meant for the Indian coaches in the ISL, former India player and Bengaluru FC assistant coach Renedy Singh said, ""I'm happy that his season is going well, but it hasn't finished yet. Jamil should just continue and I'm sure a lot of Indian coaches will be hoping that he succeeds so that the others can follow.""That Khalid completely outsmarted his counterpart on Sunday, was quite evident from what Manolo said after the match. ""We didn't know how to play against them,"" conceded Manolo, ""In the first half if the score was 4-0 for them, it was fair. We started okay in the second, but when they scored their second ... Finished!""","Jamshedpur FC coach Khalid Jamil achieved an Indian Super League first 'double' over the weekend.

With head coach Andy Reid at the helm and a defense that has been dominant all season, the Chiefs enter the game as favorites to solidify their dynasty.Jalen Hurts and the Eagles are determined to avenge their previous Super Bowl loss and claim the franchise’s first title since 2017. Philadelphia boasts a powerful roster, including a strong offensive line, explosive playmakers, and a defense capable of pressuring Mahomes.Saquon Barkley has been a crucial part of the Philadelphia Eagles ' offense this season, playing a key role in their run to Super Bowl LIX. The star running back has delivered an outstanding performance, surpassing 2,000 rushing yards and proving to be a game-changer for the team. However, despite his impact, there is growing speculation about his long-term future in Philadelphia.Barkley signed a three-year, $37.75 million contract with the Eagles, keeping him under contract through the 2026 season. While his contributions have been vital, the Eagles' front office appears to be preparing for the future, considering the physical toll of the running back position and the potential need for a long-term replacement. Reports indicate that the team has already started evaluating other options, meeting with Miami (FL) running back Damien Martinez at the Senior Bowl.This move suggests that the Eagles are exploring a backup plan, possibly looking for a young talent to develop alongside or eventually replace Barkley.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

What does Shubman Gill's horoscope say about his captaincy future

NEW DELHI: As India prepare to get into ODI mode with a series against England ahead of the all-important Champions Trophy later this month, captain Rohit Sharma has been asked to communicate his ""future plans"" to the BCCI and selectors after the completion of the ICC event.TOI has learnt that the selectors are eager to set plans in motion for the 2027 ODI World Cup and start a transition process for Test cricket as well. They are keen to find a stable captaincy option in both formats. As for Virat Kohli , the selectors are willing to wait a bit more on his Test form, while his ODI prowess is not seen as a major problem.Opener Rohit turns 38 in April and will be almost 40 by the time the next ODI World Cup in South Africa comes around. He has endured a rough season in Test cricket in the last four months and even had to sit out of India’s last Test in Sydney in Jan. However, he hasn’t played enough ODI cricket after the 2023 World Cup.""The selectors and people in the board had this discussion with Rohit around the time of the last selection meeting. He has been told that he needs to decide how he wants to plan his future after the Champions Trophy. The team management has certain plans going into the next World Test Championship (WTC) cycle and the ODI World Cup. They want to ensure everyone is on the same page for a smoother transition,"" a BCCI source said.India travel to England for a five-Test tour after the IPL and the selectors will be tempted to have a long-term opening option in place along with fresh leadership. India have named Shubman Gill as the vice-captain of the ODI team for the Champions Trophy. However, there have also been some discussions around Hardik Pandya being given the responsibility, given his experience.As for the Test captaincy, with Jasprit Bumrah’s fitness under the scanner, it won’t be an easy call to pick a successor to Rohit. It is understood the selectors may want to give the captaincy to someone young who can take the team forward.""Bumrah’s chances of a long Test series or completing a full season will always be in doubt. The selectors may want a more stable option. Gill has been seen as a captaincy prospect but his returns in Test cricket have been average. Rishabh Pant could also be a strong candidate and maybe someone like Yashashvi Jaiswal can be groomed for the role,"" said a source.","Board, selectors seek clarity for smooth captaincy transition.

India’s updated squad for ODI series against England:

The suspense around Jasprit Bumrah 's fitness continues as the updated squad for the ODI series against England released by the BCCI on Tuesday does not feature his name, while he was earlier expected to be available for the third match of the series.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) added mystery spinner Varun Chakaravarthy to the squad, rewarding him for the 14 wickets, including a five-wicket haul, he took in the five-match T20I series against England. It earned him the 'Player of the Series' award.Initially, when India's ODI squad was announced last month, the BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar had expressed hope for Bumrah to recover in time from his back injury for the third match.Bumrah suffered back spasms during the Sydney Test and could not bowl during Australia's second innings.""With Bumrah, we are waiting to hear about his fitness and when he's likely to be available,"" Agarkar had said while announcing the squad for the England white-ball series and Champions Trophy. ""At the moment I don't think he is likely to be fit for the first couple of games (ODIs vs England) at least from what we gather. We will probably hear more in the next week or so about his fitness.""I know he was asked to offload for five weeks of bowling, which is early first week February if I'm not wrong. And we'll probably find out a bit more around that time what exactly and with regards to what his medical condition is...It's better it comes from the (BCCI) medical department than me trying to explain what exactly is wrong with him. But that's the time frame that we've been told. And hopefully, he's okay after that.""However, on Tuesday, the updated ODI squad for the England series released by the BCCI did not feature Bumrah's name.As reported by Timesofindia.com earlier, Bumrah reached Bengaluru on February 2 and was scheduled to undergo scans and further assessment under the watchful eyes of BCCI's medical team.Bumrah has been named in India's Champions Trophy squad but his participation in the eight-team tournament depends on the outcome of the scans and assessment at the National Cricket Academy.The first ODI against England will be played in Nagpur on February 6, and the next two on February 9 and 12.

MI Cape Town continued their rampant run in the SA20 when they beat Paarl Royals by 39 runs in the first qualifier on Tuesday. With their comfortable win at St George's Park in Gqeberha, MI Cape Town booked their place in the final at the Wanderers in Johannesburg on Saturday. Paarl Royals, meanwhile, will have another bite at the cherry when they take on the victor of the Eliminator between Joburg Super Kings and Sunrisers Eastern Cape.MI Cape Town will enter the final with momentum on their side, picking their fifth win in a row and extended their unbeaten streak seven. The last time they tasted defeat was against the Paarl Royals on January 15.Royals, on the other hand, are headed in the other direction as they succumbed to their third loss in a row, having waltzed into the playoffs courtesy a flawless home record - just like MICT.On Tuesday at St George's Park, the Royals never looked like bothering MICT. Even when three of MI Cape Town's wickets fell in the gap of six runs and eight balls. Or when David Miller and Dunith Wellalage built a 33-run stand and then Miller took the onus alongside Dinesh Karthik.The PR captain Miller slammed three boundaries in the ninth Corbin Bosch over. He then went big on two consecutive balls for back-to-back sixes in the 14th over. Despite this big hitting, the Royals never really looked like getting close to MI Cape Town's 200-run target.The game was put beyond the Royals' reach in the very first innings itself. St George's Park had seen an average total of 129 this season with the highest coming from the bat of MI Cape Town batters (174/7) at the start of the season.After the Royals won the toss and decided to field, they were put under the pump from the get go. Ryan Rickelton (44 from 27 balls) and Rassie van der Dussen (40 from 32 balls) continued their exploits this SA20 season. They quickly made their mark and raced off to 73/0 after the powerplay overs. Both the MICT batters dealt in boundaries with seven fours and four sixes between them.Just when Paarl Royals appeared to have applied the brakes with three quick wickets, up stepped George Linde (26 from 14 balls) to shift the flow of the game.MICT ended with a flourish, producing 74 runs from the last five overs - 15, 6, 9, 27, 17 respectively - to put the eventual outcome beyond any doubt. At the heart of the late flurry were Dewald Brevis (44* from 30 balls) and Delano Potgieter (32* from 17 balls).","MI Cape Town beat Paarl Royals by 39 runs in the first qualifier of the SA20 tournament.
