NEW DELHI: Controversial dismissals have been part of cricket ever since the game started. But this edition of the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) has been rocked by controversial dismissals on more than one occasion.The match between Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals in Delhi on Tuesday saw a controversial dismissal of the visiting team's skipper Sanju Samson make headlines.The incident occurred in the 16th over when Samson was caught by Shai Hope at the long-on fence off Mukesh Kumar .It was a tight catch at the long-on ropes and Hope somehow managed to grab it. Third umpire checked it and declared it out.Hope was close to the boundary and he made sure he didn't step on the rope despite a couple of wobbly movements at the end. But the replays were not clear if Hope completed that clean without touching the boundary.Samson was walking off but the Royals dugout believed the fielder touched the rope. The Royals skipper started walking off and only to return to the middle to have a heated discussion with the on-field umpires.Samson fell for 86 off 46 balls and the Royals lost the match by 20 runs.The official broadcaster shared a clip on X of former Indian cricketer-turned-commentator Navjot Singh Sidhu sharing his views on the controversial dismissal.In the video Sidhu says, ""The game changed at the dismissal of Sanju Samson. If we look at the replays side-on the foot touches the boundary twice and it's very clear. Either you don't use technology, but if you are using it, and if the technology errs, it's just like.""""So the foot touches the boundary line twice and after that if someone says it's out, the fans and a neutral person like me, then I would say now that you have shown it to me, now you're saying. It's not out. Whatever the rule may be, but you can see it clearly, some evidences are very strong to disbelieve. They are very conclusive. It's like finding a trout in a glass of milk. Then whatever happened there, the umpire didn't do it deliberately. No one is at fault. It happens. It's a part of the game. But the game changed there,"" Sidhu, who is known for his witticisms, added.This was only the third defeat for the Royals in 11 matches and they are still at the number two spot in the points table.With 6 defeats and 6 victories in 12 matches, Delhi Capitals are at the fifth spot.",The match between Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals in Delhi on Tuesday saw a controversial dismissal of visiting team's skipper Sanju Samson. The incident occurred in the 16th over when Samson was caught by Shai Hope at the long-on fence off Mukesh Kumar. Third umpire checked it and declared it out.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109931660,imgsize-73604,width-400,resizemode-4/109931660.jpg"

NEW DELHI: As the 17th edition of Indian Premier League ( IPL ) reaches its climax, every match becomes pivotal in the race to secure a spot in the Playoffs. Each point holds immense value, particularly for the teams in the middle of the table, who are engaged in a frenzied pursuit.The upcoming IPL encounter between Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Capitals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Tuesday is one such critical game.Rajasthan Royals are determined to cement their position in the Playoffs, while Delhi Capitals are fighting to keep their hopes alive in the tournament.Apart from the intense battle between the two sides, there is an intriguing subplot that will capture the attention of the fans.The face-off between the two captains, Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson, adds another level of intrigue to the match, with both players having been selected in India's squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup in America and the Caribbean. They will be eager to outshine each other to secure their place in the playing XI as the team's primary wicketkeeper-batsman.The challenge at the Arun Jaitley Stadium will encompass all aspects of the game – wicketkeeping, batting, and leadership abilities. It promises to be a thrilling contest as both captains strive to showcase their skills and lead their respective teams to victory.In the history of their IPL encounters, Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals have engaged in 28 head-to-head matchups. Among these, the Royals have maintained a slightly superior record, clinching victory in 15 of those encounters. However, the Capitals have proven to be formidable opponents, securing wins in 13 gamesThe Arun Jaitley Stadium has been a battleground for thrilling IPL encounters, hosting a total of 87 matches. The statistics reveal a balanced competition between teams batting first and second, with 40 victories for sides setting targets and 46 for chasing teams.

Notably, the powerplay phase has been productive, yielding an average score of 59.1 runs, while the death overs have seen teams accumulating 52.2 runs on average, underlining the significance of strong starts and finishes in matches at this venue.During the IPL 2024 season, the Arun Jaitley Stadium continued its trend of favouring teams batting first, with all three matches won by sides setting targets. These encounters witnessed an even higher average first innings total of 249 runs, indicating a propensity for explosive batting displays.The Kotla wicket has been a batting-friendly one this season. The scores of 200 runs were breached on three occasions. The Arun Jaitley wicket might assist the spinners if dew doesn't play a role in the night.DC head coach Ricky Ponting revealed a day before that the match will be played on the same wicket that hosted the DC vs SRH match. He also said that wicket might assist the spinner and it won't be easy to hit through the line as the game progresses.1) Given the batting-friendly nature of the Kotla wicket and the frequent breaches of the 200-run mark, selecting batsmen who have been in good form could yield high fantasy points. Look for players who have demonstrated consistency and the ability to score big runs in previous matches.SEE ALSO: IPL 2024 PURPLE CAP STANDINGS 2) With the Arun Jaitley wicket likely to assist spinners, especially if dew doesn't affect conditions, investing in quality spin bowlers could be a wise fantasy strategy.

'Rohit Sharma will undoubtedly be...': Michael Clarke downplays Indian skipper's slump in form,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/rohit-sharma-will-undoubtedly-be-michael-clarke-downplays-indian-skippers-slump-in-form/articleshow/109919563.cms,"(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Former Australia captain Michael Clarke has downplayed the significance of Rohit Sharma 's recent string of low scores, suggesting that the fatigued Indian skipper should consider taking a break to rejuvenate before leading India in the upcoming T20 World Cup .Rohit, set to captain India in the global tournament next month, has struggled with four single-digit scores in his last five matches for Mumbai Indians in the current IPL season.The 37-year-old has endured a demanding season, including a rigorous five-Test series preceding the IPL, with Mumbai Indians now almost out of contention for the playoffs.""Rohit, being the wise judge of his own performances, will undoubtedly be disappointed, especially considering his strong start. In my view, he might be feeling a bit fatigued as well,"" Clarke told Star Sports.""A break to freshen up could do wonders for him, but as the Indian captain and a key player for Mumbai Indians, you're not getting a break. He's going to have to find form,"" Clarke continued.Rohit made a brief appearance as an impact substitute against Kolkata Knight Riders last week, which raised some concerns within the Indian camp. However, just three days later, he played a full game against Sunrisers Hyderabad.Clarke expressed confidence that it's only a matter of time before Rohit returns to his usual form as a batter.""He was in a great mood. He's happy, which is a really good sign. He doesn't seem to be struggling with his timing; it's just a matter of getting out,"" he said.""With someone like Rohit, it's only a matter of time before he finds his form again. Hopefully, he stresses less and focuses on his game because he's too talented to keep missing out. He's at his best when he's timing the ball, rather than trying to force it,"" he added.Clarke, meanwhile, also had praise in store for Rohit's deputy for the World Cup and MI skipper Hardik Pandya , who returned with 4-0-31-3 in their seven-wicket win over SRH on Monday.""In the last couple of games, he's been taking wickets with his bowling, making some adjustments along the way. For an all-rounder, success in one department boosts confidence across the board,"" Clarke said.""This aspect is crucial for Hardik Pandya's cricket in any format - he needs to contribute with the ball. Initially, he didn't bowl as much as expected or desired in the first half of this tournament. However, in the last three or four games, he's returned to form.""Clarke also said Pandya used his bouncers effectively which is an essential weapon in his armoury.""He used his bouncer effectively, which I love seeing because it is a strong weapon in his arsenal. He executed the basics flawlessly, which is not only beneficial for Mumbai but also for Indian cricket as a whole, as it will enhance his overall performance,"" said Clarke.","Rohit Sharma has struggled with four single-digit scores in his last five matches for Mumbai Indians in the current IPL season.

HYDERABAD: Sunrisers Hyderabad will look to forget their recent seven-wicket loss to Mumbai Indians and boost their playoff chances against an equally desperate Lucknow Super Giants at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium on Wednesday.Sunrisers and Super Giants have 12 points each after 11 matches and the former are fourth owing to a better net run-rate. However, a loss can quickly change the equation, which the hosts are well aware of.They will count on home conditions to pocket two crucial two points as the tournament heads into its final leg. Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals top the standings with 16 points each and have virtually sealed the playoffs berths. The fight for the remaining two spots is heating up with Chennai Super Kings (12) and Delhi Capitals (12) also in contention.Sunrisers' batting came a cropper against five-time champions Mumbai, posting a below-par 173/8. Barring Travis Head (48), none of the batters contributed substantially. If not for captain Cummins' unbeaten 35, they would have ended up with a much less total. Abhishek Sharma has been quiet in his last two outings with 12 and 15, which has affected their scoring in the powerplay.Mayank Agarwal's inclusion failed to make an impact while Nitish Kumar, Heinrich Klaasen and Abdul Samad Klaasen failed to come good. Much was expected from Klaasen after the way he started the season with three half-centuries, but in the last five innings he has the scores of 2, 42*, 20, 7, 15. Their bowling, Cummins (13) and T Natarajan (15) have been shouldering the responsibilities well along with Bhuvneshwar.Meanwhile, Super Giants suffered a massive 98-run loss to table toppers Kolkata Knight Riders in previous outing and skipper KL Rahul expects his team to up their game against SRH.Rahul (431) has been doing the bulk of the scoring while Marcus Stoinis (352) and Nicholas Pooran (315) are lending a good hand. But they capitulated for 137 runs against KKR, exposing their vulnerability.Quinton de Kock has been below par while batters Ayush Badoni (152) and Deepak Hooda (134) haven't come up with any notable contribution yet. The performance of the bowling unit has been a major concern. While their pace unit, consisting Yash Thakur (11 wickets), Naveen-ul-Haq (10) and Mohsin Khan (9), has been leaking runs aplenty, the spinners - Ravi Bishnoi (7) and Krunal Pandya (5) - have had a poor run.",Sunrisers Hyderabad host Lucknow Super Giants on Wednesday.

During the hearing, the bench informed Kejriwal's lawyer, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, that if interim bail is granted, the chief minister should not perform official duties to avoid any potential conflict.

The court said that if had there been no elections, then it would not have given any interim relief, adding, ""We do not want interference at all in the working of the government.

NEW DELHI: After Delhi Capitals (DC) defeated Rajasthan Royals (RR) by 20 runs, captain Rishabh Pant praised his bowlers, especially Kuldeep Yadav , for their outstanding performance in the last overs.A masterclass from Sanju Samson nearly sealed the deal for RR, but the DC bowlers persevered to secure their sixth home victory of the year and maintain their hopes of making the playoffs.After the game Pant said, ""The way our bowlers executed at the back end was the main positive and it was really good to see. We will try to learn from every game. Even when we lose or win, we will keep our head down and keep moving forward. As always Kuldeep delivered which was great to see. It was close to par and at the same time we were thinking that if we can restrict them to 200 that would be fair and that was the thought process.""In the final three overs, DC scored 53 runs while RR only scored 20. The Royals have not pursued a target for the second consecutive game. Even though the Royals lost both of their openers during the powerplay, they were still able to stay within striking distance and looked like strong favorites to complete the chase.However, the game was flipped on its head when Sanju Samson and Shubham Dubey were removed from the game quickly, as the remaining batters were unable to keep up with the requisite rate pressure.Credit goes to Kuldeep for bowling a game-changing 18th over in which he picked up two wickets for just four runs. Overall, it was a much-needed victory for DC to improve their campaign, and aside from their problems with their plodding over-overs bowling, the Royals will be concerned about their second consecutive defeat.DC climbed to the fifth spot with six wins, six losses and 12 points. RR stayed second with eight wins, three losses and 16 points.","Delhi Capitals (DC) defeated Rajasthan Royals (RR) by 20 runs.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals secured a crucial 20-run victory over Rajasthan Royals in a must-win game at home on Tuesday to keep their IPL playoffs alive.The win for Capitals came courtesy an all-round effort with both bat and ball as Royals fell short in a steep 222 chase.The DC spinners Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav dished out impressive performances after batters fired in unison.Yet again, it was Jake Fraser-McGurk (50) and Abishek Porel 's (65) coruscating display of power-hitting that took DC to a challenging 221 for eight.Royals, needing a win to guarantee their spot in the playoffs, started their chase strongly. However, the dismissal of captain Sanju Samson, who scored a blistering 86 off 46 deliveries, in the 16th over proved to be a turning point. The Royals' innings lost its momentum following Samson's departure, and they ultimately fell short, finishing at 201 for 8.Wrist spinner Kuldeep (2/25 in 4 overs) and left-arm spinner Axar (1/25 in 3 overs) exhibited impressive control over line and length that did put brakes on Royals' scoring rate in the middle overs.The two bowlers gave away just 50 runs in their combined seven overs.After Tuesday's win, Delhi Capitals moved to fifth place with 12 points -- the same as three other teams -- but even if they win their remaining two contests, it will be difficult for them to make the knockout stage as the teams placed above them have better chances of logging 18 points. DC can have a maximum of 16 points.Veteran off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin had jolted the Capitals with wickets in his successive overs but pacer Avesh Khan bled runs.Samson's stroke-making was a treat to watch, even as Jos Buttler could not make the most of a dropped chance. Samson treated the seasoned pacer Ishant Sharma with utter disdain, scoring easy boundaries off him.Buttler struggled to get going and was handed a chance when he was on 8 as Jake Fraser-McGurk dropped a high catch off Mukesh Kumar.The England batter dragged one from left-arm spinner Axar, who displayed the art of containing the batters on a small ground like Kotla.Kuldeep too had the batters in a tight leash as the asking rate grew. Rasikh Dar cleaned up Riyan Parag after getting hit out of the park.Samson completed his fifty with a six off Kuldeep and then launched a severe attack on Dar, who leaked 18 in runs in the 13th over of the innings.Royals needed 91 runs from 42 balls. Debutant Shubham Dube supported his skipper well as he hit a monstrous six off Ishant after hitting a four.Left-arm pacer Khaleel Ahmed bowled four wides in a row before creating a chance to get rid of Samson, whose lofted shot just fell short of long-off fielder.However, after the departure of Samson, Royals innings fell apart.Earlier, had it not been some smart bowling by Ashwin and fellow off-spinner Riyan Parag in the middle overs, DC would have put more runs on the board.Young Australian batter Fraser-McGurk (50 off 20 balls) continued with his splendid form while Abhishek Porel contributed 65 off 36 balls. Tristan Stubbs chipped in with a useful 20-ball 41 but skipper Rishabh Pant's (15) bat did not talk much.Royals pacer Trent Boult and Sandeep Singh came in with hit-the-deck approach and largely succeeded in not letting home openers swing freely. The initial boundaries were largely well-timed drives and lofted shots in the 'V' space.Fraser-McGurk grew restless and began to throw his bat around. The Australian gradually got his rhythm and was harsh on Avesh, who he blasted for 28 runs, plundering four fours and two sixes in the fourth over of the innings to complete his half-century in just 19 balls.As fate would have it, Fraser-McGurk had a soft dismissal when he hit a full-toss from Ashwin straight to cover fielder Donovon Ferreira. Shai Hope too departed soon in a rather unfortunate fashion. Porel hit Sandeep straight, the ball touched the bowler's hand before crashing into the stumps, and caught the West Indian outside the crease.Yuzvendra Chahal (1/48 in 4 overs) began with a slightly fullish length and was hammered for six by Porel. Parag, though, did a great job with his off-spin as he managed to keep the batters quiet.Ashwin returned and got rid of Axar Patel, who had just hit Parag for a maximum. Porel though kept going strong and completed his fifty while Avesh continued to bleed runs. In his two overs, he conceded 42 runs.RR captain Sanju Samson handed the ball to Ashwin and he delivered yet again, this time sending back Porel with a back of the length ball that the southpaw could not connect well.The home skipper didn't do much, throwing his wicket away with a sweep shot off Chahal. DC gathered 65 runs from the last five overs.",Delhi Capitals beat Rajasthan Royals by 20 runs to keep IPL playoffs alive. DC spinners Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav give impressive performances. Jake Fraser- McGurk (50) and Abishek Porel (65) top score for DC.

NEW DELHI: Was it a clean catch or was it not? The match on a knife's edge - somewhat tilting towards Rajasthan Royals - and a debatable catch sparking a controversy of sorts.RR skipper Sanju Samson (86 off 46b; 8x4, 6x6) - in the form of his life - was going ballistic and looked set to singlehandedly win the game for his team against Delhi Capitals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Tuesday.It was the 16th over of the Royals innings and 60 runs were needed off 27 balls with Mukesh Kumar bowling. A gettable task in the modern T20 game. Samson got hold of an off-cutter from Mukesh and smacked it with ferocity, trying to clear the long-on boundary. But, Shai Hope - stuttering and stumbling - managed to hold on to the catch. TV replays showed that Hope's small strides - in pursuit of the catch - were almost parallel to the boundary cushion.The TV umpire decided that cushion didn't move, Samson felt Hope had touched it. Samson stayed on the field for a while, arguing with the umpires but finally had to saunter away to the dugout.The dismissal took the wind out of the sails of Rajasthan Royals, as Shubham Dubey (25 off 12b; 2x4, 2x6) - Samson's partner in a 59-run fourth-wicket partnership - fell in the next over to Khaleel Ahmed. Kuldeep Yadav 's double-wicket 18th over just sealed the deal for DC as the home team went on to win by 20 runs. The victory kept DC's hopes of a playoff spot alive, as they jumped to the fifth in the points table.Meanwhile, bowlers must be breathing a sigh of relief that Australian selectors did not pick Jake Fraser-McGurk for the upcoming T20 World Cup.JFM, as he is now being referred to, is in imperious form. The 22-year-old is meting out tennis shots to all kinds of bowlers. It was a sight to see Fraser-McGurk flat bat a tennis-like forehand to a great of the game, Trent Boult.The Delhi Capitals opener did so in the third over, evoking awe and surprise from the New Zealander. Fraser-McGurk (50 off 20b; 7x4, 3x6) went on to smash two more boundaries and take 15 runs from the over.But the next over (DC's fourth) bowled by Avesh Khan was even more special. Fraser-McGurk went berserk, clobbering the Royals bowler for 28 runs in the over. Four boundaries and two maximums ensured Fraser-McGurk brought up his fourth IPL fifty off just 19 balls.Rajasthan introduced Ashwin to stem the run flow, and the wily off-spinner had an immediate impact. Fraser-McGurk wanted to dominate Ashwin from the word go but could only push a full toss straight to the extra cover fielder, bringing curtains to a highly entertaining innings.Fraser-McGurk's opening partner Abishek Porel (65 off 36b; 7x4, 3x6) was enjoying the fireworks from the other end till the Australian was there at the crease. Soon after his departure, Porel took over the mantle of taking down the bowlers. Porel took a special liking for RR's spinners. The left-hander smacked a six each off Ashwin and Yuzvendra Chahal to make sure the run-rate didn't drop.Shai Hope's run-out and Axar Patel holing out to the long-off fielder did dent the DC innings a bit. Capitals skipper Rishabh Pant also couldn't do much, falling to Chahal after scoring 15 (off 13).Porel too was dismissed by Ashwin, who ended with figures of 3/24 on a turf that had runs written all over it.At this juncture, DC were losing their way ahead of the death overs. But, Tristan Stubbs (41 off 20b; 3x4, 3x6) had other ideas. The South African, in tremendous form, continued on his merry ways. Stubbs hammered Chahal's fourth - and the innings' 18th over - for 21 runs, and then kept the hitting process going against Boult and Sandeep Sharma in the next two overs as DC finished at 221/8 by the end of the 20 overs.","Sanju Samson's 46-ball 86 in vain as Delhi pull off 20-run win over Rajasthan Royals.

I have played against him (Ferreira) in South Africa and I knew he was a back foot player and wanted to stay a little full and quick and get him out first ball,"" Kuldeep said at the post-match presentation.""I bowled a couple of seam-up deliveries to read what the batters are doing.

If he picks me, I will give my best,” Parthib said during a freewheeling interaction with TOI.Parthib, along with Jithin this season, has been a bright spot in the Highlanders’ last two Indian Super League campaigns and has been getting better with time and experience. He had eight shots on target, of which three were goals, in 18 appearances in 2022-23 and continued the form at Durand Cup this year with his first hat-trick for NEUFC.Having extended his NEUFC contract till 2026-27, Parthib scored five goals for his team this ISL season while also providing two assists. But what captivated fans are three spectacular strikes from long range – against title winners Mumbai City, Chennaiyin and East Bengal.Parthib expressed his love for such piledrivers during the interaction. “That’s something I really love to do. Even while playing FIFA on Playstation, I always look for opportunities to shoot from distance,” he said.Having started his football journey as a two-year-old by following his brother Pragyan – also his teammate and “mental support” at NEUFC – to the field, Parthib has had the support of his entire family in his pursuit.“My father and his colleagues started a football training centre in 2005 that trains kids even today. My brother used to go there for training from 2005. My father, who was not a footballer but loves the game, used to carry me to the ground when I was two to watch my brother play and if I liked it, I could play it too. So that's how my football journey started in 2007. Also, papa used to get football clips on his phone, like those of Messi or Ronaldo, for us and watching these clips, I got attracted to the game,” Parthib said before adding with a laugh, “I have broken many doors in my house.”Having climbed through the ranks of Assam age-group teams, Bengaluru’s Ozone Football Academy and Indian Arrows, Parthib has also represented India at age-group competitions, the most recent being U23 AFC Cup Qualifiers in China followed by friendlies in Indonesia.But the bigger test begins for him this week as he looks to grab a place in Stimac’s scheme of things and add a goalscoring touch to the squad against Kuwait and Qatar.Asked about his future goal, the Messi fan and self-proclaimed “Barcelona boy” said, “I want to become one of the best footballers in India.”The dream bodes well for India, too, with the team in dire need of goal scorers as Chhetri approaches his twilight days with the team.",Parthib Gogoi named among probables for India's World Cup qualifiers. The 21-year-old is one of the new faces that head coach Igor Stimac chose to give a shot. He will join NEUFC teammate and fellow first-time India probable Jithin MS for the four-week camp.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109926665,imgsize-90938,width-400,resizemode-4/109926665.jpg"
Premier League: Manchester United thumped 0-4 by Crystal Palace amid uncertainty over Erik ten Hag's future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/premier-league-manchester-united-thumped-0-4-by-crystal-palace-amid-uncertainty-over-erik-ten-hags-future/articleshow/109901537.cms,"(Inputs from Reuters)

NEW DELHI: Michael Olise 's two goals propelled Crystal Palace to a resounding 4-0 triumph over Manchester United at Selhurst Park on Monday, marking the first time in their history that Palace have secured a league double over the Red Devils. The result will undoubtedly intensify the scrutiny on United manager Erik ten Hag .Palace's attack repeatedly exploited United's patchwork defence, which featured Casemiro playing out of position at centre-back.Jean-Philippe Mateta and Tyrick Mitchell also found the back of the net in the commanding victory.Despite the loss, United remain in eighth place with 54 points from 35 games, trailing sixth-placed Newcastle United by two points. Their chances of securing European football for the upcoming season are rapidly diminishing. Palace, on the other hand, sit in 14th place with 43 points from 36 matches.United's injury woes were compounded by the absence of Bruno Fernandes, who missed a match due to injury for the first time in his 230-game Old Trafford career. The ease with which they were defeated will be a significant concern for everyone associated with the club.This marks the first instance in the Premier League era that United have suffered 13 defeats in a single season, and the scoreline could have been even more lopsided.Under the guidance of new manager Oliver Glasner, Palace have found their rhythm, while United are stumbling towards the end of a season that cannot conclude soon enough for Ten Hag.","Crystal Palace defeated Manchester United 4-0 at Selhurst Park on Monday.

He scored from close range in the 36th minute following a corner kick and then set up Jackson for Chelsea's fourth goal in the 48th minute.Jackson added his second goal of the match 10 minutes from the end, latching onto a long pass from Moises Caicedo and remaining onside, as confirmed by a VAR review.The outcome propelled Chelsea to seventh place in the league table, surpassing Manchester United , who have a match scheduled for Monday.

And with India's back to the wall and a job at stake, coach Igor Stimac finally opened the doors for Indian talents in I-League to be included in the national team squad.On Saturday, the head coach announced the first list of probables for June's crucial World Cup qualifiers and it included four players - three of whom are from Mizoram - from the erstwhile top-division league that had lost its relevance in India team selection under the Croatian.With the job at hand being guiding India to end as one of the top two teams in Group A, Mohammedan SC's Indian top scorer David Lalhlansanga, Aizawl FC striker Lalrinzuala Lalbiaknia, Inter Kashi midfielder Edmund Lalrindika and Real Kashmir defender Muhammad Hammad were called for the four-week camp in Bhubaneswar starting on Friday.Former Aizawl FC forward Lalhlansanga, who played a vital role in Mohammedan's stupendous run to I-League title this season, scored five goals with two assists in 22 appearances for the champions this season.The 22-year-old's state-mate and an attacker in his former club, Lalrinzuala created history by becoming the highest Indian goal-scorer in I-League with 15 goals and broke the record held by his idol Sunil Chhetri and Mohammed Rafi .Meanwhile, 25-year-old playmaker Lalrindika had a productive season for debutants Inter Kashi, scoring four and providing eight assists.With veteran defender Sandesh Jhingan missing the vital qualifiers with injury, Real Kashmir centre-back Hummad could be an important addition to realise India's dreams.Stimac's commitment to finding recruits in the attacking department was also proved by the inclusion of four new faces to accompany veteran Sunil Chhetri and Rahim Ali as India's strike force.The northeast's continuing role as supply line saw one more player from the seven states to join the three debutants from Mizoram as Assam and NorthEast United FC 's Parthib Gogoi got a chance to prove his mettle after a couple of top-class goals in Indian Super League .His NEUFC teammate Jithin MS, too, was gifted with an opportunity for his four goals and three assists as Stimac looked to have paid heed to his critics with an interesting list of young new faces with dreams to shine for India.A final list is expected after Indian Super League final on Saturday with players from the finalists club missing from the first list of probables that will take on Kuwait in Kolkata on June 6 before travelling to face Qatar in Doha on June 11.The squad: Goalkeepers: Amrinder Singh, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu; Defenders: Amey Ganesh Ranawade, Jay Gupta, Lalchungnunga, Muhammad Hammad, Narender, Nikhil Poojary, Roshan Singh Naorem; Midfielders: Brandon Fernandes, Edmund Lalrindika, Imran Khan, Isak Vanlalruatfela, Jeakson Singh Thounaojam, Mahesh Singh Naorem, Mohammad Yasir, Nandhakumar Sekar, Rahul Kannoly Praveen, Suresh Singh Wangjam, Vibin Mohanan; Forwards: David Lalhlansanga, Jithin Madathil Subran, Lalrinzuala, Parthib Sundar Gogoi, Rahim Ali, Sunil Chhetri","Mohammedan SC's Indian top scorer David Lalhlansanga, Aizawl FC striker Lalrinzuala Lalbiaknia, Inter Kashi midfielder Edmund Lalrindika and Real Kashmir defender Muhammad Hammad called for the four-week camp in Bhubaneswar starting on Friday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109852202,imgsize-11402,width-400,resizemode-4/109852202.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Atletico Madrid took a step closer to securing a Champions League spot with a 1-0 victory against Mallorca in LaLiga on Saturday, thanks to an early goal from winger Rodrigo Riquelme .With only four matches left to play, Diego Simeone 's team sits in fourth place with 67 points, maintaining a six-point lead over fifth-placed Athletic Bilbao.Earlier on Saturday, Real Madrid clinched their record-extending 36th LaLiga title after Girona's comeback win against Barcelona , with a score of 4-2.This result gave Carlo Ancelotti's side an unbeatable lead in the standings.

KOLKATA: The referee's final whistle was yet to be blown but Lallianzuala Chhangte briefly came over to the Mumbai City FC bench and kissed the crest of his jersey. A couple of his teammates came out of their seats to bow down to him in deference.The packed stands of 62,000 had fallen silent by that time.It was Mohun Bagan SG's heartbreak and Mumbai City FC's hurrah. It was Chhangte's night.In a team game, Mumbai City's No. 7 painted the Salt Lake Stadium's canvass with one of the finest individual performances this season, guiding his team to a remarkable 3-1 win over Mohun Bagan to lift the ISL championship title and denying Antonio Lopez Habas 's Shield winners an opportunity of doing a 'double' in the league.Chhangte, who finished the league with 10 goals - the maximum among domestic players - didn't score this time. But such was his elegant menace that he almost single-handedly brought crowd favourites Mohun Bagan to their knees. His acceleration, vision and endless determination were too much for the home team. He simply eviscerated the opponents.Mumbai City started with such intensity that Chhengte was denied by the woodwork twice in the first half. Yet, the fickle hand of football seemed to turn the script on its head in a stunning way when Jason Cummings put Mohun Bagan ahead in the 44th minute in what was the team's second shot on target at that time.But Petr Kratky 's Mumbai - having certainly learnt from their Shield-losing defeat here three weeks ago - continued to control the game with their passing and possession and always looked threatening on the break. The equalizer came in the 53rd minute through Jorge Pereyra Diaz .Mumbai soon lost Pereyra Diaz and Alberto Noguera to injury. But their substitutes Bipin Singh and Jakub Vojtus rose to the occasion, scoring in the 81st and 95th minute, respectively, giving Mumbai the deserved victory.While Mumbai players sang and danced with the cup, the result also put a question mark on Habas's strategy. They missed the usual creativity, and the likes of Manvir Singh, Liston Colaco and Dimitri Petratos were not given the license to set the tempo until the final 15 minutes when they decided to throw the kitchen sink in desperation.Mumbai started on the front foot, flourishing in Petr Kratky's pass-and-move doctrine and leaving Mohun Bagan all over the place. The imperious Chhangte - the winger with exceptional work rate - was the heartbeat of their relentless pressure on the Bagan box.Soon after Chhangte saw his lay-off across the goalline go begging, he came calling again, this time his looping shot hit the crosspiece.The woodwork came to Bagan's rescue again when, receiving the ball from Vikram Pratap Singh, Chhangte took aim at the goal, the ball coming back into play after hitting the far post.The storm was heavy but Bagan somehow managed to weather it for a while, and then added a twist to the tale out of nowhere.Two minutes after Liston Colaco fired Bagan's first shot on target in the match, the Bagan winger initiated another move just on the cusp of halftime, with his usual brisk pace down the left flank. Petratos, receiving the ball from him, unleashed a ferocious strike from the edge of the box. Mumbai goalkeeper Phurba Lachenpa could only manage to block it but Cummings --just like the semifinal second-leg clash against Odisha FC here six days ago --reacted the quickest to slam home the rebound.But Mumbai came back and stole the home team's thunder with a remarkable second-half performance.","Mumbai City FC beat Mohun Bagan 3-1 to lift ISL championship title.
