- Korir triumphs in men's race -

Ruth Chepngetich of Kenya obliterated the women's world record by almost two minutes Sunday as she won the Chicago Marathon in 2:09:56, taking inspiration from the late Kelvin Kiptum.The 30-year-old Chepngetich, who became the first three-time women's winner of the Chicago race, broke the previous world record of 2:11:53 set by Ethiopia's Tigst Assefa last year in Berlin.""I feel so great, I'm proud of myself. This is my dream that has come true,"" said Chepngetich, the 2019 world marathon champion.""I've fought a lot, thinking about the world record and I have fulfilled it.""Chepngetich, who also won in Chicago in 2021 and 2022, dedicated her latest victory to Kiptum, who set the men's world record at last year's race just four months before he died in a car accident at the age of 24.""The world record has come back to Kenya, and I dedicate this world record to Kelvin Kiptum,"" said Chepngetich.Runners observed a moment's silence on the start line in honour of Kiptum. Organisers also handed out stickers displaying Kiptum's record-breaking time of 2:00:35 for the 50,000 participants to put on their race bibs.In the absence of Olympic champion Sifan Hassan, the 2023 Chicago winner, Chepngetich set a blazing early pace and reached the halfway point in 1:04:16, the fifth-quickest time in history for a half marathon by a woman.""The weather was perfect and I was well prepared. The world record was in my mind,"" said Chepngetich.Ethiopian Sutume Kebede, a former training partner of Kiptum's, battled valiantly to stay within sight of Chepngetich but gradually lost ground on the leader.At one point, Chepngetich was on track to shave more than three minutes off the world record. She slowed slightly in the closing kilometres but still had plenty in the tank and beat her own personal best five-plus minutes.Kebede came second on Sunday in 2:17:32, with Kenyan Irine Cheptai third in 2:17:51.John Korir of Kenya won his first major marathon title after running a personal best of 2:02:44 in the men's race.The 27-year-old Korir finished ahead of Ethiopia's Mohamed Esa (2:04:39) and another Kenyan, Amos Kipruto (2:04:50).Korir was part of a seven-man group at the head of the course 30 kilometres in before he hit the accelerator and shed his rivals following a relatively conservative start.Four of the top five were Kenyans, with Vincent Ngetich and Daniel Ebenyo finishing off the podium.""It was really nice to run my PB and win in Chicago,"" said Korir, adding that he too used the memory of Kiptum as a source of motivation.""Today I was thinking about Kiptum and I said 'last year if he could run under 2:01, why not me?'

'Can hit six sixes in an over'

HYDERABAD: Sanju Samson , who has been in and out of the Indian team , justified the faith of the team management with his maiden T20I hundred in India's crushing 133-run victory over Bangladesh on Saturday.Samson has been given opportunities but he failed to cement his place. He has so far played 33 T20Is scoring 594 runs. Before Saturday's match, he had only two half-centuries to his credit.Even on India's tour of Sri Lanka in July, Samson was out for a duck in the second and third T20Is.Indian cricketers are more prone to failure than success in the shortest format especially and it is the mindset that matters. His 47-ball 111 that helped India pile up 297/6 was proof of the aggressive mindset he advocated.""You have to stay aggressive, keep looking at the scoring options. The risk is high. With the experience of IPL and international cricket, I have learned to cope with pressure and failures,"" the 29-year-old said.The management's decision to inform him of his role made it clear the cobwebs in his mind. ""Three weeks before this series, I was told that I will open. That gave me proper preparation. I went back to RR Academy and played lots and lots of new bowlers. That preparation definitely helped.""Samson said that he understands his game better now. ""I like to fail or succeed in my own way. I just want to be myself. That's what I have been sticking to from the time I started playing this game. It's all about being true to yourself,"" he added.If the four consecutive boundaries off Taskin Ahmed set the tone in the second over, the five consecutive sixes off Rishad Hossain in the 10th over changed the complexion of the match.""I know what I can do to a spinner. For the past one year or two, I have been thinking that I can hit six sixes in an over. I have been working accordingly with my mentor, with my coaches.""Meanwhile, Bangladesh batter Towhid Hridoy , who made an unbeaten 63, conceded that Bangladesh were no match and lacked in all departments.","Samson has been given opportunities but he failed to cement his place.

Experienced pacer Mohammed Shami has been omitted from the team, while Jasprit Bumrah has been appointed as the vice-captain.The selectors have decided to drop left-arm pacer Yash Dayal, who was part of the squad for the Bangladesh series.The three Tests will be played in Bengaluru (Oct 16-20), Pune (Oct 24-28), and Mumbai (Nov 1-5).""The Men's Selection Committee has picked India's 15-member squad for the upcoming three-match IDFC FIRST Bank Test series against New Zealand,"" BCCI secretary Jay Shah informed in a release on Friday.Bumrah, who captained India in the Birmingham Test against England in 2022, has been elevated to the role of vice-captain.This move suggests that the selectors are grooming him to be the stand-in skipper when regular captain Rohit Sharma is unavailable. Bumrah's promotion is likely part of the team's plans for the upcoming five-match series against Australia.In the pace department, Bumrah will be supported by Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep if the team management opts for a three-pronged pace attack. The travelling reserves include young pacer Mayank Yadav, who impressed on his debut against Bangladesh, and Prasidh Krishna, providing additional cover if needed.Shami, who has been out of action since the Men's World Cup final against Australia in November last year, remains unavailable for selection.He underwent surgery after sustaining an injury during the World Cup and is targeting a return for the Australia series.The spin-friendly wickets in India have allowed Shami more time to recover and prepare for the crucial series against Australia.The squad remains heavily reliant on spin, with Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, and Kuldeep Yadav vying for spots in the playing XI.The selectors have not picked a backup opener, with Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal expected to take on the responsibility, as they did against Bangladesh.Shubman Gill is likely to continue batting at No.3, while Rishabh Pant and Dhruv Jurel are the wicketkeeping options.India currently lead the World Test Championships (WTC) standings, while New Zealand, the 2021 title-winners, sits in sixth place.The series against New Zealand is crucial for India to consolidate their position in the WTC standings ahead of the important tour of Australia later this year.India aim to reach the WTC final for the third time, having lost to New Zealand and Australia in the previous two editions.New Zealand last visited India in 2021-22 for a two-match series, which the hosts won 1-0.","India announce 15-member squad for three-match Test series against New Zealand.

Image: Screenshot

During the 17th over of the first innings in their Women’s T20 World Cup match at Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Sunday, Australia’s Phoebe Litchfield attempted a reverse sweep against India’s Deepti Sharma.Litchfield was initially given out leg-before after missing the ball, but she opted for a review of the on-field decision, which came out in her favour.The third umpire determined that the ball had pitched outside the line of leg stump and instructed the on-field umpire to overturn the call.The Indian team looked perplexed at the decision. They seemed to suggest that as the batter changed her batting stance, she should have been treated as a right-hander.However, as per the rules, the definition of off and on sides does not change even if the batter attempts to change their stance while playing a reverse hit. As a result, it would adjudged that the ball had pitched outside leg and given not out.The rule in question falls under Law 36.1.2 of the MCC, which states that a batter can only be ruled leg before wicket if “the ball, if it is not intercepted full-pitch, pitches in line between wicket and wicket or on the off side of the striker’s wicket.”Litchfield ended up scoring an unbeaten 15 runs from nine balls, contributing to Australia finishing strongly at 151 for eight.In reply, India were stopped short on 142/9 to lose by nine-runs . With that, Australia qualified for the semi-finals while India's hopes of progressing will depend on the outcome of the Pakistan vs New Zealand match today.","Australia’s Phoebe Litchfield attempted a reverse sweep against India.

Harmanpreet's 54* in vain as India go down to

Australia

by 9 runs; SF hopes hinge on Pak-NZ game

In a stern test of character, the Indian women's team may not have failed but they still fell short, crashing to a nerve-racking nine-run loss to Australia in their final league encounter of the Women's World Cup on Sunday.Chasing a challenging 151/8, India were in with a chance until the last over.Riding on skipper Harmanpreet Kaur 's timely, unbeaten 54 (47b; 6x4), India needed 14 runs off the last over with five wickets in hand.Of course, it was gettable. But call it nerves or lack of application or Annabel Sutherland's death-over brilliance, India crumbled losing four wickets in as many deliveries. The loss notwithstanding, India are still in with a chance of qualifying for the last four.While the defending champions qualify with eight points, India are placed second with four points and a NRR of 0.322. India's fate rests on the outcome of the match between New Zealand (0.282) and Pakistan on Monday. The Kiwis will have to lose heavily to bow out of contention.Indian top-order was plagued with the familiar woes of failing to convert the starts, but Smriti Mandhana (6) was a letdown on the day.Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur walked in the final over of the powerplay as India reached 41/2 after six overs. Jemimah again squandered a good start. After a boundary in the seventh over, Jemimah pulled it to Garnder at deep midwicket as India 47/3 in 6.5 overs. But recovering to score 110/4 in the 16th over, India lost the plot in the final over.Earlier, after Renuka Singh (2/24) gave India a strong start with a double blow, Ellyse Perry and Phoebe Litchfield injected life in the death overs.Sharing the new ball, off-spinner Shreyanka Patil kept it tight as she conceded just two in her first over.The 28-year-old Renuka put India in early control, picking up two-in-two. After being hit for a boundary, Renuka bounced back. A sharp catch by Radha Yadav , who came in for an injured Asha Sobhana, at backward point sent Mooney back.Coming in at No. 3, Georgia Wareham, facing RCB teammate Renuka, was back in the dugout for a golden duck. With Australia reduced to 17/2 in 2.5 overs, stand-in Captain Tahlia McGrath had a tough task. Australia toiled to 37/2 in the powerplay.McGrath picked a fuller delivery from Pooja Vastrakar in the eighth over to open her boundary count as she charged down the track to smash it through cover. It was an expensive over as Harris brought up Australia's fifty with a boundary. At the halfway mark, Australia recovered from the early blows to post 65/2.Radha came into the attack in the 12th over and picked up her first, but only after skipper Harmanpreet dropped McGrath. Much to Harmanpreet's relief, Radha gave India the breakthrough, as McGrath was stumped two deliveries later.Ashleigh Gardner brought up the team 100 with a beautiful shot down the ground off Vastrakar. After a failed review later, Vastrakar struck off the next delivery, as Radha picked up another catch, this time of Gardner.Ellyse Perry (32, 23b) upped the tempo. She first pulled Shreyanka's short delivery for a boundary towards square before lofting the next one over deep mid-wicket for a maximum. The seasoned Deepti accounted for the dangerous Perry, as she holed out to substitute fielder Sajana Sajeevan at deep mid-wicket.",India's fate now rests on the outcome of the match between New Zealand and Pakistan.

SHARJAH: Captain Harmanpreet Kaur struck an unbeaten 54 but India's nine-run loss to six-time champions Australia took her side's fate for a semifinal spot out of their hands in the women's T20 World Cup here on Sunday.With Australia marching into the semifinals undefeated, the defeat meant India will now have to wait for the outcome of third-placed New Zealand's match against Pakistan on Monday.A win for New Zealand will see them leapfrogging India - who currently have a better Net Run Rate but same points (four) - for the final four.Chasing 152, India were bolstered by Harmanpreet's fifty (54 not out off 47 balls, 6x4s) and her 63-run stand for the fourth wicket with Deepti Sharma (29), but they crumbled under pressure to be restricted to 142 for nine in 20 overs.With 28 needed off the last two overs, India took 14 off the penultimate over. Needing 14 runs from the last over, they lost as many as four wickets to concede the game to Australia, as Harmanpreet was stranded on the other end.India paid the price for sloppy fielding and also leaving it too late in run chase. Only two fours were hit between 7.4 and the end of 14th over as Harmanpreet hit her first boundary on her 15th ball.India's lack of initiative resulted in the asking rate zooming past 10 per over and 53 from the last five, but a four each from both Deepti and Harmanpreet in the 16th over did, even though momentarily, raised hopes.Deepti found Wareham at the deep midwicket, perishing for a 25-ball 29 with three fours.If Deepti's dismissal broke India's momentum, Richa Ghosh's (1) run out three balls later off a superb direct hit from Phoebe Litchfield dealt a body blow to India's hopes.Harmanpreet also had luck favouring her when Darcie Brown spilled a catch while diving forward at deep backward square leg, off Wareham in the 13th over, when she was on 15.At the start of run chase, Shafali showed the right intent but perished soon.Having hit a four and a six off Megan Schutt's second over, she found Annabel Sutherland at long-on off Ashleigh Gardner in the fourth over for a 13-ball 20.Jemimah Rodrigues hit consecutive fours off Sutherland to put pressure back on Australia, but Smriti Mandhana's struggle to find any momentum with the bat met a disappointing end.With leg-spinner Sophie Molineux angling the ball into the left-hander, Mandhana played a horrendous across the line shot, only to be hit in front of the wickets.It was indeed a surprise that Australia were forced to go upstairs after being rejected by the on-field umpire, which they successfully got overturned.India's misfortune persisted when Jemimah, looking in red-hot form, hit one straight to Gardner at deep midwicket who made no error in collecting a diving catch.Jemimah made a 12-ball 16 with three fours.Renuka Singh Thakur (2/24) and Deepti Sharma (2/28) played pivotal roles in the bowling department but Australia posted 151 for 8 after opting to bat.While Renuka struck twice early on, Deepti grabbed the crucial wickets of Grace Harris (40) and Ellyse Perry (32) in later stages.However, contributions from makeshift opener Harris, stand-in skipper Tahlia McGrath (32), veteran Perry and Phoebe Litchfield's late nine-ball 15 not out helped Australia set a tough target for India.","Australia beat India by nine runs in women's T20 World Cup quarter-final.

Leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed, who dealt with illness and was subsequently taken to hospital during the first Test, will also sit out, as per ICC.Taking to X, Hasan said that ""tough times make comebacks sweeter"" and told his teammates that they are ""champions"" and have done wonders for the country.""Tough times only make comebacks sweeter!

Keep believing and you'll be back stronger than ever, Inshallah!,"" posted Hasan on X.Haseebullah, Mehran Mumtaz , Kamran Ghulam , fast bowler Mohammad Aliand off-spinner Sajid Khan come into the squad.Babar made scores 30 and five across the two innings of the match, adjudged lbw to Chris Woakes in the first innings and edging to wicket-keeper Jamie Smith off the bowling of Gus Atkinson in the second. His last 50+ score in the format came back in December 2022, and in his last 17 Test innings, he averages just 20.70. In his last eight innings on home soil, where runs have flowed for others, Babar averages just 18.75.In the first Test, England became the first team to ever take a first innings lead of over 200 runs after conceding over 550 in the first innings. Pakistan by contrast became the first team to lose a Test match by an innings after scoring over 500 runs in the first innings, thanks to England's 823/7d, the fourth-highest Test innings total of all time, and the highest in the 21st century. Shaheen could get only one wicket while Naseem got two.

However, it was by no means inconsequential for Sanju Samson Samson is Indian cricket's biggest enigma in recent times. He has not been able to translate his massive potential into proven performances despite making his international debut almost a decade ago.The two successive ducks in the T20 series in Sri Lanka in July and the modest returns in the first two matches against Bangladesh meant that Samson's place was on the line.However, showing no signs of pressure, Samson strode out to open the innings in Hyderabad and hit a blistering hundred (111 off 47 balls, 11x4, 8x6), the second fastest by an Indian in T20 internationals, leaving the cricketing world in awe.The highlight of that breathtaking innings was the five consecutive sixes he smashed off leg-spinner Rishad Hossain . During the post-match presentation, Samson acknowledged that his mentor had told him 'to hit five sixes in an over' and that he was waiting for that opportunity.The mentor Samson spoke about is former Kerala captain Raiphi Vincent Gomez , who watched his ward's latest exploits on television, sitting thousands of miles away in Dubai. Raiphi himself produced something similar at the domestic level some years ago when he clobbered Hyderabad allrounder Ravi Teja for five sixes in an over during the Subbaiah Pillai one-day tournament in Chennai in 2010.""I knew Sanju always had the ability to hit five sixes in an over at the international level and I am glad that he has done that now,"" Raiphi told TOI from Dubai, where he is now the head coach of Danube Cricket Lab.Raiphi reveals that Samson's six-hitting feat wasn't an overnight thing and had its origin during Covid times when he and Samson trained and discussed the game for hours. More recently, Samson flew to Dubai for a couple of days before the Duleep Trophy and specifically worked with Raiphi on improving his back-to-back six-hitting ability.""Mastering the art of playing along the ground to all types of bowlers requires years of dedicated practice. It is only after perfecting this skill that a player can consistently unleash the ability to hit sixes with precision and control.""I worked with Sanju on the key elements such as body positioning, balance, rhythm, timing, and flow. Over time, these components align seamlessly, allowing the player to ignite the right muscle groups and activate muscle memory for each shot. By understanding and mastering these angles, a player like Sanju can unlock the true potential to dominate the game with consistent power and accuracy,"" Raiphi said.""We made Sanju play against all kinds of bowlers during training because the body positioning, balance, timing, flow, and angles he needs to be in will be different for each kind of bowler,"" added Samson's former Kerala teammate.""He hit Rashid Khan for three consecutive sixes in the IPL. So I knew he could do bigger things on the international stage. In the innings in Hyderabad, the four successive fours Sanju hit off Taskin early on in his innings were equally important. I think that gave him the confidence to go after Rishad. With the kind of talent he has, I won't be surprised if he repeats these exploits,"" warns Raiphi.The innings in Hyderabad may not have just salvaged Samson's international career but would also have given him a lot of confidence. If he is able to marry the priceless gifts of timing and stroke-making with consistency, the 29-year-old can expect to become a Team India regular in the shorter formats in the days to come.",Sanju Samson hit five sixes in an over in third T20 against Bangladesh. The innings was the second fastest by an Indian in T20 internationals. Samson's mentor Raiphi Vincent Gomez says he was waiting for the opportunity.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114194671,imgsize-26518,width-400,resizemode-4/114194671.jpg"
Match evenly poised as Pondicherry take 164 runs lead against Rajasthan in Ranji Trophy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/match-evenly-poised-as-pondicherry-take-164-runs-lead-against-rajasthan-in-ranji-trophy/articleshow/114194467.cms,"Ajay Rohera.

Anything above 200 will be tough for Rajasthan: Bais

JAIPUR: Pondicherry entered the match with a reputation of an underdog who would struggle against Rajasthan ’s bowling line-up that boasts of reputed players like Deepak and Rahul Chahar, Khaleel Ahmed, Aniket Choudhary and Manav Suthar.Despite the air around them, the visitors fought hard to finish at 207/6 with 164 runs lead on Day Three, leaving the match evenly poised.Starting at the overnight score of 234/6, centurion of Day Two, Rajasthan captain Deepak Hooda (128 off 197 balls) along with tailenders played for another 12.3 overs. They added 57 more runs before Pondicherry left-arm spinners Sagar Udeshi and Ankit Sharma bundled them out at 291.Coming out to set the target, openers Akash Kargave (54 off 50 balls) and Ajay Rohera (39 off 83 balls) gave Pondicherry a spirited start to overhaul the deficit of 43 runs and take a lead of 28 runs by 15.1 overs in their second innings of their Elite Group B Ranji Trophy 2024-25 game at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Sunday.For Rajasthan, giving the ball to Rahul immediately paid off as he struck twice on two consecutive deliveries of the 16th over to dismiss Kargave and Paras Ratnaparkhe on a golden duck.Like in the first innings, Rohera and Anand Singh Bais shared the responsibility to help set a good score. But it was Suthar who foxed Rohera with his left-arm spin to end the Pondicherry duo’s 45 runs partnership in the 30th over. Bais was then briefly joined by Ankit Sharma (23 off 27 balls) and his captain Arun Karthick (11 off 6 balls).Rajasthan seamers troubled the batsmen with reverse swing. Bais was a victim of it as he was adjudged LBW off Deepak Chahar and had to depart at 45 off 107 balls.Because of bad weather, the last 20 minutes of the game were lost. At stumps, Aman Khan was playing at 11 not out off 50 balls while Fabid Ahmed was at 3 off 12.Sharing his thoughts on the day’s play, the 33-year-old Bais said that it was not that difficult to bat on. “The plan was to stay long at the crease. Batting on the third day wasn’t that tough. It’s only that a few balls kept low. And with the old ball, Rajasthan experienced seamers were quite effective with their reverse swing that helped them get a couple of wickets later in the day,” the middle-order Pondicherry batsman stated.He added that the team will try to post a target of at least 200. “Batting on the fourth day is going to be tough. If we give them a target of 200 plus, it would be tough for Rajasthan.”He shrugged off the tag of underdog and said that Pondicherry cannot be taken lightly. “Almost all Rajasthan bowlers have played India, and Manav also comes with a lot of exposure and is in the India reckoning. We know they are a strong bowling unit, but we are also confident of our abilities and will make it tough for them,” he said.","Anything above 200 will be tough for Rajasthan: Bais.

Left-handers Kamindu Mendis and skipper Charith Asalanka guided Sri Lanka to a formidable 179-7 in the opening T20 against the West Indies at Dambulla on Sunday.Sri Lanka, asked to bat first, built a competitive total on the back of a dynamic 82-run partnership off 54 balls between Kamindu and Asalanka.Kamindu, riding a wave of remarkable form, registered his second T20I half-century.Earlier this month, he equalled the legendary Sir Don Bradman by becoming the third-fastest player to reach 1,000 runs in Test cricket -- a feat that underscored his rising stature.The left-hander's sparkling innings ended on 51 off 40 balls, studded with five boundaries and two sixes, when he mistimed a pull shot off debutant Shamar Springer Roston Chase completed the catch, diving forward running in from fine leg.Asalanka compiled a quickfire 59 off just 35 balls, including nine fours.His brisk knock concluded in the penultimate over when he could not quite clear mid-on, but not before giving Sri Lanka's innings a powerful boost.The West Indies are third in the global T20 rankings, while Sri Lanka languishes in eighth.The match began 30 minutes late due to a damp outfield, though the full 20 overs per side were retained. Romario Shepherd stood out among the bowlers, capturing two wickets for 39 runs in his four-over spell.The remaining two T20s against the West Indies, also at Dambulla, will be played on October 15 and 17, before the teams head to Pallekele for a three-match ODI series.Upbeat hosts Sri Lanka are hoping to continue a run of success after celebrating victories in Tests and ODIs.Sri Lanka ended a 27-year dry spell by winning an ODI series against India, celebrated a Test victory in England after a decade, and notched their first series win over New Zealand since 2009.",Sri Lanka beat West Indies in opening T20 at Dambulla.

Coach Mauricio Pochettino made a successful debut in charge of the United States, leading them to a 2-0 friendly win over Panama on Saturday.Pochettino, who left Premier League side Chelsea in May after one season in charge, was appointed last month to replace Gregg Berhalter, following his dismissal after a humiliating early exit from the 2024 Copa America .The new boss spent much of the first half on the sidelines giving instructions to his team, who were unable to find the back of the net despite threatening chances, the closest coming from former Chelsea striker Christian Pulisic , whose shot after a quick breakaway was blocked by goalkeeper Orlando Mosquera.Pulisic, however, found his rhythm and showed glimpses of his scintillating start to the season with AC Milan when he delivered a fine cross for Yunus Musah to finish with aplomb four minutes after the break.Goalkeeper Matthew Turner helped the Americans maintain their advantage, denying efforts by Yoel Barcenas and Jose Rodriguez as Panama failed to equalise, and substitute Ricardo Pepi put the icing on the cake with a late goal in stoppage time.Having won his first game in charge, Pochettino will be looking to continue that streak when the U.S. travel to Guadalajara to take on Mexico on Tuesday.",Mauricio Pochettino made a successful debut in charge of the United States.

India are still without a win in 2024, Manolo Marquez is yet to taste success after three games with the national team, yet the 1-1 away draw against Vietnam in an international friendly on Saturday was one of its better games over the last year.Bui Vi Hao expectedly put Vietnam ahead after 38 minutes at the Thien Trưong Stadium in Nam Dịnh, but India fought back with a goal from Farukh Choudhary (’58) in the second session.The visitors were under pressure in the last quarter but held on for a morale boosting draw with two players -- Aakash Sangwan and Lalrinliana Hnamte – making their national team debuts.The last time both teams faced each other, India were thrashed 3-0.A major part of the credit for the draw should go to goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu . The India captain watched in disbelief as the ball hit his leg and sailed inside in the first half. But for most part, he was simply unbeatable. He proved it with multiple saves, including an early penalty, and a stunning reflex late in the game. When the ball did move past him, Anwar Ali – another impressive performer – came to the rescue with a goalline clearance towards the closing stages.Farukh, too, deserves appreciation. Left out in the cold after his last game in October 2021 for India, Manolo handpicked the Chennaiyin forward after his impressive showing in the first three games for his club in the ISL. He didn’t disappoint and was lively with his movements. The first attempt on goal came from his left foot, a powerful drive from outside the box that went straight to the keeper.Another attempt from an acute angle, after Brandon Fernandes had cleverly picked him inside the box with a no-look pass, forced a low save from the goalkeeper, using his legs.Higher-ranked and technically superior Vietnam were the better side in the first half and forced mistakes from the India defenders. The pressure finally paid off in the 38th minute, when a clearance off a Vietnam corner fell to Vi Hao, whose attempt deflected off Anwar, then Gurpreet’s leg, before rolling in, despite a desperate dive.India are not known for their comebacks, particularly when playing away, but this team hit differently in the second session. It was midfielder Suresh Singh who created the goal out of nowhere: he sent a long ball from India’s own half that evaded Vietnam captain Que Ngoc Hai and Farukh showed remarkable composure to lob the ball with his left foot, over the stranded goalkeeper.The last time Farukh scored was against Nepal in Sep 2021. A month later, he played his last international game.Vietnam had chances to register a win at a venue they have won their last two games. India’s defence at times was brittle and were saved the blushes by Gurpreet’s inspired form.Only if Liston Colaco thought and finished better, India could have killed it on the counter in stoppage time.",Bui Vi Hao expectedly put Vietnam ahead after 38 minutes.

Manolo Marquez will have to wait for his first win as India head coach as his team played out a 1-1 draw in an entertaining international football friendly match against Vietnam here on Saturday. Vietnam took the lead in the 38th minute through Nguyen Hoang Duc before Farukh Choudhary equalised in the 53rd minute at the Thien Truong Stadium , around 100 km from Hanoi.In Marquez's two matches as head coach so far, India drew against Mauritius and lost 0-3 to Syria in the Intercontinental Cup in Hyderabad last month.Ranked 116th, Vietnam are 10 spots higher than India (126th) in the FIFA rankings .In an eventful first half, India goalkeeper and captain Gurpreet Singh Sandhu stopped a penalty kick awarded to Vietnam in the 10th minute after Rahul Bheke fouled a home side attacker. Vietnam captain Que Ngoc Hai's shot, however, went straight to Sandhu.Two minutes before that, Choudhary was let free in an Indian attack but his left-footer from just outside the box was stopped by Vietnam goalie Nguyen Filip.Vietnam were on the ascendency as the match progressed and Nguyen Van Toan's shot in the 17th minute went just wide off the mark.In the 27th minute, India also got a chance but again Choudhary's left-footed shot from a difficult angle off a pass from Brandon Fernandes could not beat the Vietnam goalkeeper.Chau Ngoc Quans almost gave Vietnam the lead in the 32nd minute when he outsmarted an Indian defender with his turn and his left-footed curler beat Sandhu but the ball went wide of the post by few inches.Vietnam's goal eventually came six minutes later. Bui Vi Hao's volley from inside the box deflected from an Indian defender and Gurpreet's outstretched leg was able to touch the ball but not enough to send it out of harm's way.All Nguyen Hoang Duc had to do was just push the ball into the open net from the goal-line.India played much better in the second half. They had periods of dominance and also found the equaliser in the 53rd minute.Defender Anwar Ali sent a long aerial ball from near the centre line and Choudhary won an aerial duel with Vietnam captain Que Ngoc Hai rather easily and he chipped the ball over an onrushing goalie Nguyen Filip into the empty net.Ten minutes later, Lallianzuala Chhangte 's chip into the Vietnam box almost found Choudhary's feet but the home side goalkeeper was able to lay his hand on the ball.India called the shots in the initial period of the second half and the Blue Tigers rattled the home team's defence quite often. In the meantime, Choudhary was substituted by Edmund Lalrindika.In the 71st minute, Chhangte's shot took a deflection and went out for a corner.But from there on, Vietnam came back strongly and dictated terms in the last 15 minutes. They created a series of scoring chances but could not convert any of them.In the 79th minute, Sandhu made a brilliant reflex save to deny Van Vu's snap shot from inside the box.Three minutes later, central defender Anwar Ali made a goal-line save as he headed out a goal-bound shot.Originally, India were to play in a tri-Nation tournament but Lebanon pulled out, citing difficulties in flying out of the country due to the ongoing crisis at home. The tournament was planned in the FIFA international match window from October 7-15.India were earlier scheduled to play against Vietnam on October 9 and against Lebanon on October 12 before Lebanon's pulling out left them to play just one match.",Vietnam took the lead in the 38th minute through Nguyen Hoang Duc. Farukh Choudhary equalised in the 53rd minute at the Thien Truong Stadium. India goalkeeper and captain Gurpreet Singh Sandhu stopped a penalty kick awarded to Vietnam in the 10th minute.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114174489,imgsize-49818,width-400,resizemode-4/114174489.jpg"

Shanghai, Oct 13, 2024 -Novak Djokovic insisted Sunday that he plans ""to compete and play next season"" despite suffering another loss at the hands of world number one Jannik Sinner .The 37-year-old Serb, the holder of a men's record 24 Grand Slam titles , went down 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 to the Italian in the final of the Shanghai Masters .However, Djokovic said he has no intention of following career-long rival Rafael Nadal into retirement even though he endured by his own admission ""one of the worst-performing seasons in terms of results"".""I don't know what the future brings, I'll just try to kind of go with the flow to see how I feel in a given moment but I still plan to compete and play next season,"" he told reporters.Djokovic failed to add to his Grand Slam haul in 2024 as Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz , who claimed the French Open and Wimbledon titles, took possession of the sport's major honours.However, Djokovic was crowned Olympic champion , winning an emotional roller-coaster of a final against Alcaraz in Paris in August. That was his 99th career title.Sunday's loss left him frustratingly short of becoming just the third man after Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer to win 100 titles.""It's not a live-or-die type of goal for me, I think I've achieved all of my biggest goals in my career,"" he said.""Right now it's really about Slams and about still seeing how far I can kind of push the bar for myself.""Djokovic hailed Sinner who at 23 is 14 years his junior. His title in Shanghai was his seventh of the year.""He's very solid from the forehand and backhand, doesn't make too many mistakes, and just tries to take away the time from the opponent,"" said Djokovic.""That's something that reminds me of myself throughout my career, that's what I've done for so many years consistently, playing fast-paced tennis , taking away time from the opponent, kind of suffocating the opponent in a certain way.""","Novak Djokovic says he plans ""to compete and play next season"" The Serb lost 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 to Jannik Sinner in the final of the Shanghai Masters. The 37-year- old Serb is the holder of a men's record 24 Grand Slam titles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114195001,imgsize-33394,width-400,resizemode-4/114195001.jpg"
