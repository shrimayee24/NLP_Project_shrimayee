Tigress in 'boar' well: Prey and hunter's joint survival tale,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tigress-in-boar-well-prey-and-hunters-joint-survival-tale/articleshow/117928086.cms,"BHOPAL: Panchtantra met Jungle Book in the forests of Seoni , Madhya Pradesh, when a tigress chasing a boar fell into a well, along with the prey, in the heat of pursuit. Trapped in a battle for survival, both the hunter and hunted treaded the water together, often rubbing against each other in the closed confines.The two mostly faced away from each other. The tigress probably realised predation was pointless if it couldn't eat the kill. The boar, with nowhere to run, followed the predator's lead, even leaning on it when tired. Both were rescued by evening by forest officials with some jungle jugaad . Thereafter, each went its own way.Fittingly, this drama played out in the forest that was the setting for Kipling's 'Jungle Book'. Mowgli's Seoni is in Pench national park , around 400km from Bhopal. Villagers of Piparia Harduli, in Jikurai forest area, were in for a shock when they made their morning walk to the well to fetch water - a tigress and a boar were looking up at them. The tigress, exhausted from swimming, was visibly tired but remained calm. The boar would struggle from time to time just to stay afloat, trembling more from its proximity to the tigress than the cold water.Villagers alerted forest office. Kurai forest range assistant Shariq Khan got the call. A team from Pench tiger reserve, along with police, arrived on the scene and realised that there was no manual for such a rescue and they had to come up with some jugaad.The well was roped off to keep villagers well away from the scene of operation. Foresters worked out a system of ropes and tackles and used a JCB and a hydraulic crane to lower a cot and a cage into the well. The tigress lunged at it, and grabbed on to it, roaring, growling and refusing to let go. Foresters knew the cot would break under the tigress' weight and tried to push it away with a stick. The tigress snarled and roared and swiped at the stick, but it eventually got the message and went back into the water. When the cage was lowered, with its trapdoor open, the tigress attacked it. It took a while to understand that the metal beast wasn't going to swallow it and gingerly climbed into it, to cheers from the rescue team. The trapdoor fell shut.The boar, meanwhile, had realised that the cot was meant for it and climbed on to it. Both animals were pulled to safety. The boar was released back into the forest. The tigress, believed to be about three years old, will be released in Nauradehi sanctuary of Veerangana Durgavati tiger reserve in Sagar.","A tigress chasing a boar fell into a well, along with the prey, in the heat of pursuit.

Milwaukee Bucks vs Charlotte Hornets matchup overview

Thewill face the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday, February 5, with superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo listed as questionable due to a patella injury. The two-time MVP is among five Bucks players on the injury report, raising concerns about Milwaukee’s lineup heading into the game.The Milwaukee Bucks, currently 26-22, will need to monitor Antetokounmpo’s status closely as they look to maintain their position in the Eastern Conference standings. The Hornets, struggling at 12-35, have seven players dealing with injuries, including LaMelo Ball, who remains out with an ankle issue. Giannis Antetokounmpo ’s availability is in question, but he’s not the only key player dealing with an injury. Damian Lillard is also listed as questionable with a groin issue, while Khris Middleton (ankle), Bobby Portis (personal), and Brook Lopez (back) are probable for the game. If Antetokounmpo and Lillard are sidelined, Milwaukee will have to rely more on Middleton and Lopez to step up offensively.In the last 20 games, Giannis Antetokounmpo has averaged 25.9 points, 11.1 rebounds, and 4.9 assists per game. His absence would leave a significant gap in Milwaukee’s scoring and rebounding efforts. Meanwhile, Lillard, who has contributed 21.7 points and 6.4 assists per game, would be another major loss if unable to play.Milwaukee has outscored opponents by an average of 1.5 points per game, ranking 12th in the league with 114.3 points per contest. The Milwaukee Bucks also rank seventh in three-pointers made per game (14.2) and second in three-point percentage (38.6%). However, their rebounding struggles—ranking 18th in the league—could be further exposed if Giannis Antetokounmpo is unavailable.On the other hand, Charlotte has faced challenges throughout the season, ranking 28th in scoring with 107 points per game. Miles Bridges has been the team’s leading scorer, averaging 20.8 points and 8.1 rebounds in the last 20 games.Also read: Will Khris Middleton play tonight against the Charlotte Hornets?

"Ex-Yankees HC Sean Casey claims Pete Alonso to sign $80,000,0000 deal with Reds in 2025",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/ex-yankees-hc-sean-casey-claims-pete-alonso-to-sign-800000000-deal-with-reds-in-2025/articleshow/117943075.cms,"Ex-Yankees HC Sean Casey claims Pete Alonso to sign $80,000,0000 deal with Reds in 2025 (Image Source: Getty)

Sean Casey's take on Pete Alonso's future with Reds

""Bro, I think it's a great move. Let him go there three years, 80 million. Opt out after year one. Go hit 50 tanks. Get his confidence back, swing back. Next thing you know, he's back on the market. And he proves himself. You don't think

Terry Francona

wants Pete Alonso in the middle of that lineup?""

""Of course he does. Like I said, Terry Francona wants, I bet you Nick Kroll and Castellini, you know, we're like, listen, we're going to put together a team for you to win now. And they have. They've done a really nice job. And that team they put together right now is a team that could win that central. No doubt about it,""

Jack Flaherty back w Tigers. Could Reds sign Pete Alonso? What do Verlander & Scherzer have left?

""I think, at this point, too much damage has been done. I think it would be a mistake for both sides to bring Pete back. I know it’s gonna happen. They’re gonna bring Pete back, the Mets fans are gonna be excited...ignoring a lot of facts here that can lead to a bad relationship.”

""The Mets may want him, but they don’t really want him. He may want to be back, but he doesn’t really want to be back. He had no other options...and the Mets don’t have other options at this point. I don’t think the Mets bringing back Pete Alonso is good for anybody.”

With the New York Mets out of the picture, the Cincinnati Reds have come out to be an interesting candidate in Pete Alonso 's hiring. In fact, according to the former head coach of the New York Yankees , the Reds can also offer Alonso a massive contract of $80 Million, which is more than the offer the first baseman received from the Mets.In Monday's episode of ""The Mayor’s Office with Sean Casey"" podcast, the former Yankees head coach talked about Pete Alonso's future with the Reds with his co-host Rich Ciancimino. When Ciancimino mentioned the possibility of Alonso receiving an impressive offer from the Reds, Casey said:he further added.There's a better chance for Pete Alonso's hiring with any other team than the New York Mets. MLB analyst Sal Licata recently claimed that the Mets ""don't really want"" Alonso and finds the decision to resign him as a ""mistake."" Talking about the same, the Licata said:Even if Pete Alonso wants to get signed with the Mets, Alex Bregman is a huge competitor that Scott Boras would have to beat first. However, according to a recent report, Boras wants to ""eliminate"" Bregman as a competition to make the way clear for Alonso to the Mets.","Sean Casey claims Pete Alonso to sign $80,000,0000 deal with Reds in 2025.

NBA Trade Rumor: Is Kevin Durant's Tenure At Phoenix Suns Over After Latest Buzz Surrounding Jimmy Butler,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/nba-trade-rumor-is-kevin-durants-tenure-at-phoenix-suns-over-after-latest-buzz-surrounding-jimmy-butler/articleshow/117947101.cms,"Image via Getty Images

The Jimmy Butler-Kevin Durant trade-off is getting a little complicated



Kevin Durant might be rejoining his ex-teammate in this massive trade-off



The NBA trading deadline is fast approaching, and teams are all over each other to find players that fit their style. While some others are trying to offload players from their roster and find them new homes. But it's all reaching a boiling point with so little time left in hand. And the latest rumors suggest there is a possible three-way deal in the works between the Phoenix Suns, Golden State Warriors , and Miami Heat, about Kevin Durant and Jimmy Butler.Miami Heat's relationship with Jimmy Butler took a hit after he wasn't offered a contract extension, and of course, the suspension for seven games for conduct detrimental to the team. Now he wants out of Miami, and Miami wants out of the Butler business. But the issue is with Kevin Durant, and what is his place in the team. Butler has been giving priority to the Suns during the trade, but that has a lot to do with his wish to play alongside Durant.But currently, the Suns can't retain Durant (and Beal) while also bringing in Butler. Although for Butler, Phoenix is his top priority should a trade happen, his camp has also been negotiating with the Heat to get past the issues they have had recently. Whether he stays or goes, is a matter of less than 48 hours. And with the Golden State creeping in to steal Durant back, it will be an interesting couple of days, to say the least.Currently, things are looking a little bleak about whether the trade-off will really take place. Or whether with so much conversation happening at the same time between so many people, the time will run out before things can firmly take shape. The Suns want Butler on their team, but that was in exchange for Bradley Beal. Unfortunately, his no-trade clause is not helping with the current situation, as Beal does not want to move to Miami. This leaves the Suns with no other option but to offload Durant if they want to be in Butler.“One reason for the significant uptick in Durant chatter, sources said, is that trading him appears to be the only way for Phoenix to acquire Miami's Jimmy Butler before Thursday's deadline. Why would the Suns want Butler if they no longer have Durant on the roster? No one asked by The Stein Line has been able to furnish a good answer to that question, but rumbles persist that a scenario that transports Butler from South Beach to the desert — with Durant moving back to the Bay Area — is indeed in play.”If Kevin Durant gets the chance to go back to Golden State and play alongside Stephen Curry once again, this will be the cherry on top. The Warriors are trying to absolve themselves of the guilt of trading off Durant back in 2019, against the wishes of Curry. But if they can bring him back now, it will be tremendous for the team to have the duo back inside the court together.Also Read: NBA Trade Rumor: Golden State Warriors Want To Go All-in On $194.2 Million Suns Star To Elevate Stephen Curry’s Title Hope","The NBA trading deadline is fast approaching, and teams are all over each other to find players that fit their style.

Travis Hunter And His Fiancee, Leanna Lenee, Get Brutally Trolled As Leanna Becomes Emotional On Meeting Lil Wayne



Travis Hunter And His Fiancee, Leanna Lenee, Have Stayed Away From The Spotlight



Travis Hunter, the Heisman Trophy winner , has been on the news lately as he tried to deal with the hate his fiancee, Leanna Lenee, has received from his fans. While the couple tried to move on from it, a new video has sparked controversy again and fans have started brutally trolling Travis Hunter and his fiancee, Leanna Lenee. In this undated video, Travis Hunter’s fiancee, Leanna Lenee, meets famous rapper Lil Wayne for the first time and gets visibly emotional. Travis Hunter can be seen laughing about it as Leanna Lenee has tears in her eyes.This undated video has sparked outrage on social media as fans questioned Travis Hunter’s fiancee, Leanna Lenee’s loyalty to Travis. A fan commented about their upcoming wedding, “He still gonna take that ""L"" and not sign that prenup i bet”, while another fan wrote, “Did she just say I love you 🤦🏾She just embarrassing on the regular!”A third fan wrote, ““She’s a fan” bro if my girl starts crying when meeting another MAN im leaving 😭”Another fan commented about the fact that how Travis Hunter’s fiancee, Leanna Lenee was not emotional when he received the prestigious Heisman Trophy in December. The fan said, “Oh but she couldn’t cry when he was getting those Awards ??? She is a piece of work hunny”Neither Travis Hunter nor his fiancee, Leanna Lenee, have issued any statements about the situation yet. However, Leanna Lenee has been a huge fan of the famous rapper Lil Wayne for a pretty long time.When Travis Hunter received his Heisman Trophy in December 2024, he said, ""Wayne, you don't know how you came into our life. My fiancée loves you. She told me, 'You gotta listen to this. If you're going to listen to music, listen to Wayne…When I get in that TRX, and I blast that music, I'm listening to Wayne.”A month later, Travis Hunter signed with Lil Wayne's Young Money APAA Sports agency.It is evident how much of an impact Lil Wayne has had on Travis Hunter and his fiancee, Leanna Lenee.The hate that Leanna Lenee received this time is not something new; in December fans questioned her “intentions” as many speculated she is in a relationship with Travis Hunter “only due to his wealth and fame”. However, both Travis Hunter and Leanna Lenee have constantly defended their relationship and spoke about the love they have for each other.But none of their statements really worked and the hate had an impact on Travis Hunter and his fiancee, Leanna Lenee. Both have continued to stay away from the spotlight since then. They are set to get married in May 2025.Also Read: Taylor Swift hints at something major amid Blake Lively-Justin Baldoni drama, ahead of Super Bowl 2025","Travis Hunter's fiancee, Leanna Lenee, meets famous rapper Lil Wayne for the first time and gets visibly emotional.

the game is rigged and you’re going to win the championship because you know someone from the NFL Officials

“All the refs are great, man. They do the best they can.” subtly answers Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes

Patrick Mahomes disagrees he + Chiefs get extra calls from NFL refs

The NFLRA issued a statement, “There are many things that fans can worry about over a 17-game season,”

NFL experts DESTROY crazy conspiracy theories about the Chiefs! | CND 1/29

When someone wins consecutively, people question if the game’s rigged. It's not the hard work that catches the eye, but winning a championship for the second time in a row, that makes an impression and invites all sorts of conspiracy theories .That’s what happened to the Kansas City Chiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes . He must be tired of answering the questions that hint that -. Patrick is tired, and that’s what he showed when Rich Shertenlieb asked him who his favorite referee was!Rich Shertenlieb’s point-blank question: “For your whole career, you have had so many great people help you win. So, who is your favorite Ref?”3-time Super Bowl Champion Patrick Mahomes answered, “That’s hilarious. All the refs are great, man. They do the best they can, and we go out there and play the game the right way.”Shertenlieb further pinched Patrick, “Is there one that you give a Christmas card to every year possibly?”3-time Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes pursed his lips and appeared to be lost in thoughts. After a moment, the Chiefs QB answered, “Not that I can remember. I’ll talk to some of my teammates to figure out.”Addressing the conspiracy theories, the NFLRA issued a statement on officiating integrity. It read:“Commissioner Goodell’s comments that it is ‘ridiculous’ to presume that NFL Officials are not doing everything possible to make the right call on every play is spot on,” said Scott Green, Executive Director of the NFLRA.“Officiating crews do not work the same team more than twice each regular season. It is insulting and preposterous to hear conspiracy theories that somehow, 17 officiating crews consisting of 138 officials are colluding to assist one team.There are many things that fans can worry about over a 17-game season, such as coaching decisions, player injuries, the weather, and, yes, even close calls on incredible plays made by incredible athletes. But you can rest assured that on every single down, NFL Officials, both on the field and in the replay booth, are doing everything humanly possible to officiate every play correctly.”","Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was asked who his favorite referee was.

Travis Scott BRUTALLY Handled by NBA Security After They FAIL to Recognize Him at the LA Lakers-Clippers Game

On Tuesday night, the shorthanded Los Angeles Lakers , led by a dominant LeBron James , delivered a resounding 122-97 victory over their city rivals, the Los Angeles Clippers. Despite missing key players like Anthony Davis , the Lakers displayed their championship mettle. However, the game was overshadowed by a bizarre incident involving rap superstar Travis Scott .Here's everything you need to know about what happened with the Highest in the Room rapper at last night's game.At the star-studded Intuit Dome, Scott was attempting to exit the arena when an overzealous NBA security guard, seemingly unfamiliar with the ""SICKO MODE"" artist, mistakenly identified him as an unauthorized individual. The guard proceeded to grab Scott's arm and attempted to forcibly remove him from the court.Furthermore, the Los Angeles Lakers , in their first game since the earth-shattering trade that sent Anthony Davis to Dallas for Luka Doncic , flexed their muscles against their crosstown rivals, the Los Angeles Clippers, with a resounding 122-97 victory. LeBron James , the King himself, put on a clinic, dropping 26 points, dishing out nine assists, and grabbing eight rebounds, while his future co-star, Doncic, watched courtside with a mixture of approval and anticipation. Doncic sidelined with a calf injury, was a picture of focused intensity, clapping and fist-pumping with the enthusiasm of a seasoned veteran.This victory wasn't just about the final score; it was a statement. A declaration that the Lakers, despite the seismic shift in their roster, remain a force to be reckoned with in the Western Conference. With the arrival of Dončić, a generational talent who can single-handedly take over a game, the Lakers have not only reloaded, but potentially supercharged their championship aspirations.ALSO READ: Dallas Mavericks' Kyrie Irving Reacts to Luka Doncic Los Angeles Lakers Trade: 'Just Really Shocked' Nonetheless, with the unfortunate incident with Travis Scott at LA Lakers-Clippers game, serves as a reminder that even global superstars can fall victim to misidentification, highlighting the importance of heightened awareness and better training for security personnel in high-profile events.",Travis Scott was forcibly removed from the Intuit Dome by NBA security.

When and where to watch the game between the Cavaliers and the Pistons (February 5, 2025)

Garland, who has averaged 22.7 points and 7.0 assists over his last 20 games, would likely take on a bigger scoring and playmaking role. Meanwhile, Jarrett Allen, who leads the team with 10.2 rebounds per game, would be crucial in maintaining dominance in the paint.Cleveland's success this season has been driven by its ability to outscore opponents, with a +10.5 point differential per game.

Rohit Sharma's batting in ODIs has been game changing: Shubman Gill

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

NEW DELHI: India's star all-rounder Hardik Pandya is brimming with confidence. He is eager to step onto the field, send the ball soaring into the stands, and rattle the stumps with his fiery bowling. Known for turning games on their head, Hardik Pandya is all set for the highly anticipated ICC Champions Trophy in Pakistan and Dubai, starting from February 19.India will play all their ICC Champions Trophy matches at the Dubai International Stadium, beginning their campaign against Bangladesh on February 20.The much-awaited clash against arch-rivals Pakistan is set for February 23, followed by their final league-stage encounter against New Zealand on March 2.In an interview shared by the International Cricket Council (ICC) on Wednesday, Pandya reminisced about the electrifying 2022 T20 World Cup showdown between India and Pakistan in Melbourne - a match India won by four wickets.Having claimed three wickets in that game, the pacer reflected on how he handled the immense pressure of the high-stakes encounter against Pakistan.""It is just about who handles pressure better. I don't play for Hardik Pandya; I play for the team. I play for India—that's the goal. Whether that means playing just two balls at the end or batting for 60 balls, the focus is on taking the game ball by ball and getting closer to victory. Let’s see who cracks under pressure,"" Pandya told in an interview posted by ICC.India began their T20 World Cup campaign against Pakistan, winning the toss and electing to field in front of a packed crowd at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground.""When I entered the field and saw the atmosphere—the kind of energy the fans and spectators were bringing—it was just amazing. I had to take a moment to absorb it. Even though I have played many games, it was overwhelming in a way that made me both excited and happy. The atmosphere for this match, especially since it was India vs. Pakistan, just took everything up a notch. This rivalry has existed for years. While we have intense competition on the field, there are also so many emotions involved. The engagement, the excitement—it's a clash that people remember and eagerly wait for.""My plan was very simple: to back my strengths and be smart about it. In the first two balls I bowled, I got a little too excited by the Australian bounce and the wicket. As a result, I bowled a couple of deliveries that turned out to be boundary balls in those conditions. When I came in for my second spell, we obviously needed wickets. I was aware that they were going to put the accelerator on and try to score boundaries to reach a decent total. That’s when I realized that sticking to good balls would be the key.""I have always been someone who relies on good length and lines—that is my strength. I definitely don’t have the variations or skill set of Jasprit Bumrah , but I do possess Hardik Pandya’s skill set. For me, bowling back-of-a-length deliveries has always been a strength. It's more about gamesmanship, awareness, and using my skills effectively.""I was aggressive—I wanted to take wickets. My mindset was: ‘If you want to hit me, hit me off a good ball.’ That approach helped me take those two wickets. Just before that, I had kept the mid-on and mid-wicket fielders up, but for that particular ball, I sent one fielder back because I sensed he was going to go after me. I knew where my deliveries were landing and where the most likely scoring areas were—especially mid-wicket. Taking those wickets was quite satisfying,"" Pandya, who dismissed Shadab Khan, Haider Ali and Mohammad Nawaz, said.India secured a thrilling four-wicket victory, driven by Virat Kohli 's masterful unbeaten 82 off 53 balls.","India's star all-rounder Hardik Pandya is brimming with confidence.

India captain Rohit Sharma expressed unease over questions around his future in international cricket at the pre-match press conference in Nagpur on Wednesday, ahead of the first ODI against England.After the Suryakumar Yadav-led India defeated England 4-1 in the T20I series, Rohit assumed captaincy of the ODI team for a three-match series, beginning on Thursday.Rohit, who is under the scanner for his poor run since the start of this season, said it's not relevant to talk about his career when there is the series against England and Champions Trophy after that lined up.""How is it relevant that I talk about my future plans when there are three ODIs and the Champions Trophy! The reports (on my future) are going on for a number of years, and I am not here to clarify those reports,"" Rohit said.""For me, the three games (against England) and the Champions Trophy are very important.

As cricketers, there will be ups and downs and I have faced those a lot in my career. This is nothing new to me. We know everyday is a fresh day, every series is a fresh series,"" said Rohit.""I am looking forward to the challenge, not looking at what has happened in the past.

NAGPUR: Exactly 15 winters ago, on a crisp Nagpur morning, a young man stood on the threshold of his biggest dream. February 6, 2010, was meant to be the day Rohit Sharma slipped into the hallowed Indian whites for the first time. At 24, brimming with nervous energy and promise, he strode onto the Jamtha ground, ready to script the first chapter of a storied career.The packed stadium at 8.45am buzzed with anticipation. But just as fate had lifted him to that moment, it pulled the rug from under his feet. A warm-up game of football turned disastrous - a twisted ankle, a cruel pause. Moments before receiving his maiden cap, Rohit's dream was snatched away, leaving him on the sidelines for three long years.Fast forward to Thursday, and Jamtha is once again set to be the stage for Rohit. This time not as a wide-eyed debutant, but as the captain, seeking not redemption but resurgence. As India gears up to face England in the first ODI at Nagpur - a curtain-raiser to the much-anticipated Champions Trophy in Pakistan and Dubai - Rohit will be looking to reignite the fire, both in himself and his team.Nagpur has been kind to him before. In 2017, it witnessed one of his masterclasses - a majestic unbeaten 102 against Sri Lanka. The surface this time, bereft of grass, promises another run-fest. If Rohit, alongside his dynamic deputy Shubman Gill , channels the template of their 2023 World Cup exploits, a score above 300 could well be on the cards. India's approach at the top has been ruthless. Since 2023, they boast the second-best powerplay run rate among the top ten teams. India, along with Australia, have smashed over 70 sixes in the powerplay in this period.Rohit's opening partner Gill has been in regal form in white-ball cricket. Since 2023, he has amassed the most ODI runs with an enviable average touching 60. His blend of elegance and precision makes him the perfect foil to Rohit's brute force.With Virat Kohli anchoring the No. 3 slot, the middle order presents a delicious dilemma. Three men - Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, and Rishabh Pant - jostle for two spots. All three have been in sublime touch, but the final XI might see Pant sitting out as Rohit hinted during the pre-match presser on Wednesday.In the bowling department, all eyes will be on Kuldeep Yadav, whose recent exploits have been pivotal to India's dominance. Alongside the seasoned Mohd Shami, who is making a comeback in ODIs, he will be crucial to India's Champions Trophy ambitions.Spinners have ruled India's bowling charts in ODIs since 2023, with Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja snaring 84 of the 115 wickets taken by Indian tweakers. If variety is what India craves, the late addition of Varun Chakravarthy might just throw a surprise into the mix. He troubled the England batters in the T20Is after bamboozling Bangladesh in another home series last October.England, meanwhile, arrive in Nagpur burdened by a string of setbacks. Their ODI form post-World Cup has been abysmal - three bilateral series, three defeats. A bruised and battered unit, their confidence teeters on the edge.Middle order holds the key for the visitors. The entry of Joe Root has boosted their chances. Apart from this, they will be banking on explosive batters like Harry Brook, Jacob Bethell, and Liam Livingstone to provide the firepower. Skipper Jos Buttler would further bolster their lineup. Wicketkeeper Jamie Smith is likely to miss the first two ODIs due to a calf issue.However, their bowling has been inconsistent, and the onus will be on Jofra Archer and Adil Rashid to put the brakes on India's formidable batting unit. Up against an Indian side eager to make a statement, England will need more than just resolve to turn things around.Rohit Sharma (C), Shubman Gill (VC), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Hardik Pandya , Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohd.

Butler, who averaged 17.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 4.8 assists this season, brings a veteran presence to Golden State.Butler’s trade was not surprising as the Miami Heat previously shared that they were open to a trade for the veteran star as his behaviors, according to the team, have been detrimental to the organization. The Heat imposed a total of three major suspensions in just a month sidelining the 35-year-old Texas native.Shams Charania broke the news of Butler’s trade to the Golden State Warriors in a recent post on X, “BREAKING: The Miami Heat are finalizing a deal to send Jimmy Butler to the Golden State Warriors for Andrew Wiggins, Dennis Schroder, Kyle Anderson and a protected first-round pick, sources tell ESPN,” he wrote.In another post, the sports reporter shared that Butler has secured his future with the Golden State Warriors, agreeing to a two-year, $121 million extension through the 2026-27 season, according to sources. As part of the deal, Butler is declining his player option for the 2025-26 season in favor of the new contract.“New Golden State Warriors star Jimmy Butler has agreed to a new two-year, $121 million extension with the franchise through 2026-27, sources tell me and @WindhorstESPN.

SA20 showcasing perfect balance between bat and ball: Vernon Philander

Sunrisers Eastern Cape 's bid for an unprecedented third consecutive SA20 title remains intact after a commanding 32-run victory over Joburg Super Kings in the Eliminator at Centurion on Tuesday evening. The defending champions will now face Paarl Royals in Qualifier 2 at the same venue on Thursday.Captain Aiden Markram led from the front with an unbeaten 62 off 40 balls (5x4, 2x6), propelling the Sunrisers to 184/6. Joburg Super Kings faltered in response, unable to form significant partnerships, ultimately finishing on 152/7.Reflecting on the win, Markram acknowledged the team's struggles in the competition but was pleased with their performance on the night. ""We haven't been at our best this comp and we've got a little bit closer to that tonight, which is great,"" he said. ""I might say this a lot in this press conference, but our bowlers have been really, really good for us. And from a batting point of view, our batters just haven't clicked the way we would have liked to. Before you know it, you're five games in, and you're like, 'sh*t, man.' Kept playing catch-up the whole time. But good signs tonight with the bat at least. Small things like that opening partnership go a really long way for us. And then for some of us to spend some time out there and to get to at least 180 is a step in the right direction, at least for now.""Markram credited the team's strong start for setting up the win. ""The start for me was massive. I think it was almost 50 on the board within four overs when we lost our first wicket. That allowed the team to absorb pressure, and then still get to 180. And I thought we probably could have got a few more as well.""SuperSport Park continues to be a happy hunting ground for the Sunrisers skipper. ""I don't have a spot in the change room. I always sort of drift around, to be honest. But I think all batters are going to say it's obviously a lot better batting here. It's nice when you're out there in the middle and you know a mis-hit can go for six. There's a quick outfield, the ball generally comes on really well, and if you're able to hit space, you get lots of twos and fours in between. It's a nice template of how you can almost have a set approach at this venue as a middle-order batter, which is quite a rare thing.""On their upcoming clash against Paarl Royals, Markram emphasised that the focus remains on improving their own game. ""To be honest, we don't look too much into where other teams are at. I don't think we've been particularly great this competition. So we're chasing, trying to play that perfect game. I know it's probably never ever going to happen, but that's what we're striving for. If we're able to get close to that, then whatever the result might be, you sleep a lot better at night.""Meanwhile, JSK coach Stephen Fleming reflected on his team's campaign after their exit. ""You probably have to unravel our season a little bit and put it in perspective. We were hanging on a little bit with the amount of injuries we had, and we just had holes during each game where we weren't able to be as accurate as we needed to be. Today they played well, got themselves out of a situation, and then put us under pressure in the last couple of overs. It was still a good score. We were happy with 185 as a pass score on that surface, but we just came off a little bit flat.""Fleming lamented the lack of significant contributions from his top order. ""We needed the bigger boys to stand up and get the 75-plus and lead the way. Unfortunately, we just gave wickets away too easily and too often. It's a pretty simple formula of losing, but I won't say proud, though I am satisfied with how we hung together in what's been a pretty tough season.""The JSK coach acknowledged that constant squad changes hampered their campaign. ""The turnover was high. If you look at our squad when we first put it all together, it was very strong with South African bowling and overseas batting. But we just weren't able to settle enough, and I take some responsibility with that as well. We were looking for calmness with the bat, but today we were anything but.""Sunrisers Eastern Cape now shift their focus to Paarl Royals, knowing another strong performance will take them to a second successive SA20 final and keep their historic hat-trick bid alive.","Sunrisers Eastern Cape beat Joburg Super Kings by 32 runs in Eliminator.

'How is it relevant for me to talk about my future?'

Pant out? Rohit hints Rahul might just make the cut

NAGPUR: Rohit Sharma 's press conferences usually carry a light-hearted charm, laced with wit and laughter. But on Wednesday, ahead of the first ODI against England, the Indian skipper's easy smile was missing on a few occasions. The air was thick with murmurs about his future in white-ball cricket — whispers that seemed to test his patience.""How is it relevant for me to talk about my future when we have three ODIs and a Champions Trophy ahead?"" Rohit shot back when quizzed about his plans. ""These reports have been around for years, and I am not here to clarify them.""While Rohit made it clear that his eyes are firmly set on the immediate challenges, rumours persist that the BCCI has asked him to spell out his future after the Champions Trophy.The speculation stems from Rohit's forgettable outing in Australia, where he managed just 31 runs across five innings at a dismal average of 6.20. However, the Indian captain was quick to dismiss any hangover from that tour. ""This is a different format, a different time,"" he said, his tone sharpening. ""Ups and downs are part of cricket, and I have faced plenty in my career. This is nothing new. Every day is a fresh day, every series a fresh series.""Determined to look ahead rather than dwell on the past, Rohit insisted his only focus was to begin the series on a high.Asked whether India would continue its aggressive approach from the 2023 World Cup, Rohit struck a balanced note. ""There's a certain style and brand of cricket we want to play,"" he said. ""We will try to replicate what we did in the World Cup, but that was 1.5 years ago. We need to reassess what's required for this series.""Rohit stressed that the team has enough experience to adapt without constant instructions. ""The players know their roles. It's about coming together and picking up from where we left off in the World Cup. If it takes time, so be it. It's not easy to immediately replicate past performances — we need to start fresh and build momentum.""With three ODIs and the Champions Trophy looming, Rohit made one thing clear — his focus is firmly on the present. The noise around his future can wait.The debate over India's preferred wicketkeeper in ODIs continues, but Rohit Sharma dropped a strong hint that KL Rahul might retain the gloves over Rishabh Pant . He said the choice between Rahul and Pant is a good headache to have.""KL has been keeping wickets for us in ODIs for quite some time now, and he has done really well,"" Rohit said. ""If you look at the last 10-15 ODIs, he has delivered exactly what the team needed."""" We have got an option of playing Pant too. Both are quite capable of winning games on their own. It's a good headache to have whether to play KL or Rishabh. But looking at what we have done in the past, having that continuity is also very important for us. That is where we stand as a team,"" Rohit said.India have included mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy in the ODI squad, and Rohit hinted that he could get a chance if the conditions allow. ""Varun has certainly shown something different. I understand that it is a T20 format but he's clearly got something different about him. So we just wanted to have an option and see what we can do with him.""If the series presents us an opportunity to play him at some stage, we will see what he's capable of. Right now, we are not thinking about whether we're going to take him to Champions Trophy or not. But he will be in contention if things pan out really well for us and he does what is required.""Rohit threw his weight behind veteran pacer Mohammed Shami who has been included in the CT squad despite underwhelming domestic games post his return from injury.""He has not played cricket for 1 or 1.5 years. Don't judge the player so soon. He has been playing cricket for the last 10-12 years and has won us matches single-handedly,"" he said.",Rohit Sharma says he is not interested in talking about his future in white-ball cricket.

Saquon Barkley urges Swifties to support the Eagles instead of the Chiefs in Super Bowl

Saquon Barkley, a renowned football player, has made an unexpected pitch to Taylor Swift , ahead of Super Bowl 59. Barkley, who is known for his aggressiveness, is preparing to face the Philadelphia Eagles in a rematch of Super Bowl 57.Swift's connection to Kansas City has been evident over the past two seasons, primarily due to her relationship with Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce , but she was also an Eagles fan before joining Arrowhead Stadium.

In her song Gold Rush from the 2020 album Evermore, she sings about ""my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door.""Swift clarified the meaning of her lyrics during her 2023 concert in Philadelphia, resolving fan debates about the NFL team or legendary rock band The Eagles.

Jimmy Butler has been traded to the Golden State Warriors



Jimmy Butler is in the headlines again, this time not for his not-so-unusual suspension updates but he has reportedly parted ways with his former team Miami Heat following months-long dispute. Ahead of his reported trade to the Golden State Warriors , Butler’s former teammate and Miami Heat’s captain, Bam Adebayo shared his honest opinion on how Butler’s conflict with the team actually helped them to focus more on winning games. Jimmy Butler will soon be in the Golden State Warriors jersey after a highly anticipated blockbuster trade that has made headlines. Before the news broke on the internet, Miami Heat captain Bam Adebayo shared his honest take on the months-long conflict Butler had with the team.Appearing for a chat with The Miami Herald, Adebayo shared the silver lining from the conflict. “We’ve grown as players when it comes to certain situations, we’ve actually grown as men,” Adebayo said. “Being able to focus and understand that games still got to get played. The schedule doesn’t change,” he continued.The off-court conflict between Butler and the team was certainly a headline grabber as the team had suspended the 35-year-old three times for his behavior detrimental to the organization.Adebayo added, “We still got to play games. We can’t sit around and do what everybody else is doing, thinking about it and worrying about it. No, we have to go out here and hoop. That’s what our coach expects us to do. That’s what this organization, the fans—they expect us to go out there and still play basketball no matter what we’re going through.”Adebayo also reflected on his captaincy for the team in the same interview asserting that he has been trying his best to manage the team amid the Butler-Heat drama. “I feel like I’ve handled it well. If I grade myself, it’s 50-50, honestly. It’s just handling it in a way where everybody understands we can still win through this,” he shared.The Miami Heat have honored Jimmy Butler’s trade request, sending him to the Golden State Warriors in a blockbuster deal. In exchange, Golden State is parting ways with Andrew Wiggins, Dennis Schroder, and Kyle Anderson, among other assets.

'Nothing new': Rohit Sharma on his struggles ahead of England ODIs

What does Shubman Gill's horoscope say about his captaincy future

Rohit Sharma's batting in ODIs has been game changing: Shubman Gill

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer and ex-head coach Ravi Shastri understands the significance of the intense rivalry between India and Pakistan in international cricket. He recently shared his thoughts on current head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s remarks ahead of their highly anticipated ICC Champions Trophy clash.India and Pakistan, both placed in Group A of the tournament, will face off on February 23 in Dubai. The two teams last met at the venue in an ICC event in 2021, where Pakistan secured a dominant 10-wicket victory.Gambhir recently stated that the Champions Trophy group-stage match against Pakistan holds the same importance as any other fixture in the tournament, emphasizing that all games carry equal value.Speaking on the latest edition of The ICC Review, Shastri acknowledged that he had expressed a similar sentiment during his tenure as head coach but hinted that there is more to it than meets the eye.“I was the coach for seven years. Whenever I was asked, I said the same thing (as Gambhir). But let me assure you, deep down, there's a lot more to that than you actually think, that's for the media,” Shastri said.“You have to say it. But deep down, you want to win that. Because if you don't, you'll be reminded of it until the next time you play against Pakistan.“People don't care what you have done in the past. They're not bothered about the last 10 games if you won eight or you won nine. But they'll remind you if you lose one, until the next time you play them.“It can be a taxi driver, it could be anyone on the street. What happened to India? The same question to Pakistan. What happened to Pakistan? So it always plays on your mind, so whether you like it or not, it's a different game. Different beasts altogether.”Shastri, however, believes that the throwback won’t be taking up much headspace for Indian players.“No, that won't play on their mind because that was a T20 game. This is a 50-over clash. It's totally different,"" Shastri said.“And it's a longer game which suits India more, because in T20 you can get upset. In 50-over cricket, if you've got experience and you've got depth in your batting and bowling departments and you know, it makes a massive, massive difference.“And when you look at India and Pakistan man to man, India is a far better side and far more experienced as well.”",Former India head coach Ravi Shastri understands the significance of the intense rivalry between India and Pakistan in international cricket.

A win there and they will square off with MI Cape Town on Saturday for a chance at doing a staggering hat-trick.Put in to bat, SEC scored 184/6 in their allotted 20 overs with skipper Aiden Markram playing a captain's knock of an unbeaten 62 runs from 40 balls. In reply, JSK got going in patches but never enough to overhaul the target. Eventually, they were halted on 152/7 with Jonny Bairstow's 37 runs from 17 balls the biggest contribution.With the Gautrain running adjacent to Centurion, gunning at high speeds of 160-180 kmph, so were Markram, Tristan Stubbs (26 from 21) and Marco Jansen (23 from 12 balls). As they went gung ho, much of the brunt was felt by Lutho Sipamla who went for 0/72 in the four overs - the most expensive spell in SA20 history.The difference, eventually, came down to one over. Just six balls. That is where the game was largely won and lost.It was the 19th over of the SEC innings, the band was in full noise, crowd were enjoying their beers and families preparing for the grills. The 26-year-old Sipamla prepared to bowl the penultimate over.First ball, six. Full, sixth stump line, smashed beyond the sightscreen. Third ball, short, outside off, pulled into the grassbanks for six more. Next one, a no ball. Cherry on the cake at this stage. Fourth ball, freebie four with the fielder making a mess of it. Next, four more. Once again, width offered, low full toss, square drive four. Last ball, length ball, on the off stump, Jansen whips it for a maximum over deep mid-wicket.6, 1, 6, 2nb, 4, 4, 6 -- 29 runs from the over. SEC had suddenly gone from 146/5 to 175/5 before finishing on 184/6.During the chase, Devon Conway and Faf du Plessis tried to provide the launchpad with a 40-run partnership for the opening wicket. There were further stands for 22, 29, 25 and 24 but none that could circumvent the damage done by that over.Bairstow tried to replicate the mayhem with 21 runs from six balls at one point - hitting 6, 1, 4, 6, 4 - but his attempts were halted with a missed reverse sweep.As he walked back, annoyed with himself, SEC could breathe easy. They had taken a virtual step into the second qualifier at this very ground.",Sunrisers Eastern Cape beat Joburg Super Kings by 32 runs in SA20 qualifier. It was SEC's fifth consecutive loss at the picturesque ground. Aiden Markram top scored for SEC with 62 runs from 40 balls. Lutho Sipamla took 0/72 in four overs - the most expensive spell inSA20 history.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117959742,imgsize-57448,width-400,resizemode-4/117959742.jpg"

We played a lot of cricket here in Dubai. It was a pressure game, and I love pressure games. With the ball, I used the surface. I used my variations a lot,"" said Player of the Match, Gulbadin Naib.""It was a tough night. It was a great game of cricket; obviously, dew came on and made the game difficult for us.

'Nothing new': Rohit Sharma on his struggles ahead of England ODIs

What does Shubman Gill's horoscope say about his captaincy future

Rohit Sharma's batting in ODIs has been game changing: Shubman Gill

NEW DELHI: ""India win the T20 World Cup after 17 years. The drought is over. Despair a thought for what Hardik Pandya has done i n the last half an hour"" — the passionate words of the former cricketer and ex-Team India head coach Ravi Shastri still resonate in the ears of Indian cricket fans. India clinched the T20 World Cup 2024 trophy after defeating South Africa in a thrilling final.India's star all-rounder, Hardik Pandya — who was one of the architects of India’s T20 World Cup triumph in Americas — spoke to the ICC in an interview, reflecting on the exhilarating final against South Africa and how he maintained his composure in the pressure-cooker atmosphere.Pandya also shared insights into his strategy for dismissing the dangerous South African batter Heinrich Klaasen ""There wasn't much spoken. Rohit and I have played together for so many years. He knows my character, my personality, and how much I value cricket awareness. Just before the ball, I told him that I was going to bowl wide to Klaasen. I just knew he would be expecting a delivery on the stumps. His stance was slightly leg-side dominant, so I anticipated he would try to hit me there,"" Pandya said.""Just before my run-up, right before I started, I looked at him and was about to say, 'I am going to bowl a slower one.' But I hadn’t set a field for a slower ball. I had to outfox him, to be one step ahead in the game so he wouldn’t anticipate the delivery. The way he was hitting was just tremendous. That moment, I think, opened the door for us.""I have always thrived in and enjoyed these high-pressure situations; they bring out the best in me. I have always visualized myself bowling the last over or scoring the winning run in a World Cup final.""In Barbados, there was a strong breeze blowing toward the dressing room side. If he wanted to drag me, he would have to hit against the wind, which increased the chances of a mistimed shot. My strength would have been a stump yorker, but we deliberately went outside off-stump for a specific reason—if he wanted to hit us, he had to do it against the odds, not in his favorable zone. That was pure situational awareness and understanding our strengths. I think that’s why we remained calm and composed with our plans.""Rohit and I spoke after the game as well. When the ball went up in the air, it initially looked like it would land inside the 30-yard circle or that a fielder would have to run in. But then we saw the wind carrying it farther and farther, and it just kept going—it didn’t stop.""And obviously, what Surya did in that moment, with such presence of mind and calmness, was sheer brilliance. We won as a team, but for me to play such a crucial role — it feels surreal. It’s a dream that actually came true.""It felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. The relief of the past six, seven, eight months just washed over me. I’m really, really proud of how I stood strong. Maybe I didn’t show much emotion, but everything I had been going through just came out in that moment. The pressure, the burden I had been carrying, just lifted, and I thought, ‘Yes… finally, I did it for my country,’"" Pandya explained.","India clinched the T20 World Cup 2024 trophy after defeating South Africa in a thrilling final.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

NEW DELHI: Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting believes the focus now shifts to Mohammed Shami as he returns from injury in India's ongoing limited-overs series against England. Shami, who last played for India, before the England series, in the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup final in November 2023, is seen as a crucial asset for the team ahead of the upcoming ICC Men's Champions Trophy ""My biggest concern about India when they came for Australia in the Test series was [Jasprit] Bumrah not having Shami there as a backup and him having to burden most of the load,"" Ponting said on The ICC Review.""And that's probably what happened, and might even have something to do with why he [Bumrah] got hurt. He probably ended up having to bowl a bit more in that series with Shami not being there.""So look, if Shami's fit, that's a positive.""Shami made his return in the third and fourth T20Is against England, putting up an impressive performance with figures of 3/25 in his latest outing.Former India head coach and cricketer Ravi Shastri emphasised the importance of managing Shami's workload in the upcoming ODI series against England.""It will be interesting to see if India play him out in all three, or they give him the first one and the third one, and then ease him into the Champions Trophy ,"" Shastri said.""But he'll be watched very closely because 10 overs is totally different to four overs, and then you're going to see how he pulls up in the field as well having bowled those 10 overs.""Shami's form and fitness will be crucial for India as they begin their ICC Men's Champions Trophy campaign against Bangladesh on February 20 in Dubai. With Bumrah already handling a significant workload, the return of a fully fit Shami could provide India with much-needed bowling depth and balance ahead of a crucial tournament.","Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting believes the focus now shifts to Mohammed Shami as he returns from injury.

NAGPUR: Always the talking point in cricket, Nagpur pitches haven’t been short of controversies. While the pitch was rated ‘poor’ by the ICC in 2015, the Test against Australia in 2023 also saw the visitors criticising the surface. For Thursday though, a fresh, hard surface has been rolled out for the first ODI between India and England.“It seems a 300+ wicket right now, with some help to the spinners in the second half. It looks grassy now, but it might be shaved off,” said a source from VCA.Indian vice-captain Shubman Gill reckoned the wicket will dry soon. “You can never really predict how the wicket is going to play. No instructions have been given by the Indian camp regarding the pitch. I haven't seen grass being shaved off the pitch. The wicket dries here soon, so they might have kept some grass so that the surface retains moisture,” he said while addressing the media.Only one Ranji Trophy match was played on the pitch between Vidarbha and Gujarat in November 2024.

Despite Rishabh Pant 's return to the ODI squad, KL Rahul will continue as India's wicketkeeper for the ODI series against England and likely for the Champions Trophy as well, India captain Rohit Sharma confirmed.Rahul took on wicketkeeping duties during India's 2023 World Cup campaign in Pant's absence while he was recovering from a car accident. Although Rahul performed well in the tournament, Pant made a successful comeback to the T20I squad for the 2024 T20 World Cup, which India won in Barbados.Rohit emphasised that Rahul has proven his worth in the ODI format and earned his place in the playing XI for the England series. He also noted that Pant’s return provides the team with flexibility in selection, calling it a ""good headache"" to have.""Look, obviously KL has been keeping wickets for us in the ODI format for a number of years now and he's done pretty well. You know, if you look at the last 10 or 15 ODIs, he's done exactly what the team required him to do.""Rishabh is well, you know, he's there. You know, we've got an option of playing either one of them. Both are quite capable of winning games on their own. So it's a good headache to have whether to play KL or Rishabh. But obviously looking at what we have done in the past, having that continuity is also very important for us. So that is where we stand as a team,"" said Rohit while addressing the press conference ahead of the first ODI against England in Nagpur.Rohit acknowledged that the team had limited ODI matches last year but affirmed their commitment to playing aggressive cricket.""There is a certain type of cricket that we want to play, certain brand of cricket we want to play and whether it means that we have to go and do what we did in the World Cup, we will try and do that.But again, the World Cup was one-and-a-half years back, you know. So clearly we need to regroup as a group now and think about what we need to do here. Obviously, there is a lot of experience in the squad so you can't keep telling them exactly how you need to prepare for every series. They understand what is expected of the team. So, there's not much talk about what kind of approach we want to have.These guys know exactly what is required of each one of us. So it's just about coming together now because it's been a while since we played this format. So, it's just about coming together and trying to do where we left off during the World Cup. If it takes a little bit of time. So we get, you know, it's not easy to start what we did in the World Cup. As I said, the World Cup was one-and-a-half years ago. So we need to try and think about what we need to do here now and start fresh,"" said Rohit.The India captain outlined the reasoning behind selecting leg-spinner Varun Chakravarthy in the ODI squad, despite already having Ravindra Jadeja , Kuldeep Yadav, and Axar Patel in the lineup.""He has certainly shown something different. I understand that it is in T20 format, but he's clearly got something different about him. So we just wanted to have an option and see what we can do with it. Clearly, during the series it presents us an opportunity to play him at some stage and see what he is capable of.When asked if the team management is considering Chakravarthy for the Champions Trophy, Rohit responded that while he isn't currently focusing on Chakravarthy for the squad, the leg-spinner is certainly in contention.""Right now we are not thinking about whether we're going to take him or not, but definitely he will be in contention. If things pan out really well for us and he does what is required, then definitely there is something that we need to think about,"" he added.India's captain refused to talk about who all are in the picture as replacements for a fast-bowling allrounder in case Hardik Pandya gets injured like he did in the 2023 World Cup. ""Why do you have negative thoughts,"" Rohit said. ""We should have positive thoughts.""Why do you want him to get injured? Let's all pray that every player is 100 per cent fit and remains fit,"" he added.",KL Rahul will continue as India's wicketkeeper for the ODI series against England and likely for the Champions Trophy as well.

Australia remain on high alert for a spin challenge as they head into the second and final Test against Sri Lanka in Galle on Thursday, despite already securing the series. Steve Smith ’s men dominated the opening Test, claiming victory by an innings and 242 runs — the heaviest defeat Sri Lanka has ever suffered in Test cricket.That match, also played in Galle, featured a good batting surface, but conditions for the second Test appear drastically different.“This looks like a very dry surface. Dare say it's going to turn square,” Smith said on Wednesday.While Australia is yet to finalize its playing XI, Smith suggested that a decision would be made on the morning of the match based on conditions.With the Warne-Murali Trophy already in the bag and a spot in the World Test Championship final confirmed, Smith remains focused on completing a clean sweep.“I thought we played really well last week, controlling the game from the outset. We didn’t do that last time we were here, so it would be a great achievement to win 2-0,” he added.Following their humbling defeat, Sri Lanka are expected to make changes. Opener Pathum Nissanka returns after recovering from a groin injury and will replace Oshada Fernando.The bowling attack is also set for a shake-up, with off-spinner Ramesh Mendis likely to replace Nishan Peiris, who endured a tough outing in the first Test, conceding 189 runs in 41 wicketless overs.“Pathum has been declared fit and he will play. But we haven’t finalized our bowling combination yet,” Sri Lanka captain Dhananjaya de Silva said.De Silva acknowledged his team’s batting struggles in the first Test and emphasized the need for improvement.“It wasn’t the typical Galle wicket last time around. It was a disappointing Test because we should have batted much better,” he admitted.“Too many guys got starts but failed to kick on. We know where things went wrong, and we’re looking to correct those mistakes.”A Farewell for KarunaratneThe Test will also mark a significant moment for Sri Lankan cricket as veteran opener Dimuth Karunaratne prepares to retire after his 100th Test appearance.“Dimuth has been a fabulous leader and an exceptional player,” de Silva said. “He has done amazing things for the team and, without a doubt, ranks as the best opening batter Sri Lanka has ever produced. We want to give him a fitting farewell.”With Australia eyeing a series sweep and Sri Lanka determined to bounce back, the final Test in Galle promises to be a gripping contest.",Australia face Sri Lanka in the second and final Test in Galle on Thursday. Steve Smith's men won the first Test by an innings and 242 runs. Sri Lanka suffered the heaviest defeat in Test cricket history in the first match. The hosts are expected to make changes to their side for the second Test.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117953235,imgsize-27702,width-400,resizemode-4/117953235.jpg"

England playing XI

:

Former England captain Joe Root will make his return to the ODI format for the first time since the 2023 World Cup when the visitors take field in the first match of the series against India in Nagpur on Thursday.Root's return to the squad aims to strengthen England's middle-order batting, particularly in conditions favouring spin, as the team prepares for the ICC Champions Trophy that commences on February 19.""Very excited, it’s great being back involved. It's obviously been a while so to be around the group, play with a few lads who I have not seen in a while is very exciting and of course what a great venue to get back to,"" Root said in a video posted by England Cricket .The England squad, led by Jos Buttler, enters this series following a disappointing 1-4 loss in the T20I series. The white-ball tour is also the first for coach Brendon McCullum since he was promoted to be the team's all-format coach.""We have had Baz (McCullum) for quite a while now in the Test team and you know what he’s going to bring. The way he looks at the game fits nicely with how the team sets up, the skillsets we have, I think it's a really exciting mix and when you put all of them together, the sky's the limit for this team,"" said Root.Root enters the ODI squad following a successful run with Paarl Royals in the SA20 tournament in South Africa. He scored 279 runs in the tournament, including two fifties, and also claimed five wickets with his off-spin bowling.“It’s pretty obvious, being the most senior batter in the team, I'm just looking forward to getting my teeth into it to be honest. The more you play, the more experience you have, the more you’ve got to give as well which is exciting when you’re working with such talented young batters in the squad. Watching their journey, being a part of it as well, I am looking forward to it,"" Root added.Phil Salt (wk), Ben Duckett, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jos Buttler (c), Liam Livingstone, Jacob Bethell, Byrdon Carse, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Saqib Mahmood","Former England captain Joe Root will make his return to the ODI format for the first time since the 2023 World Cup.
