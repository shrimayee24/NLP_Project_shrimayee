Yunus Govt Takes Responsibility Of Dipu Das Family After India Erupts Over Hindu Man's Lynching

KOLKATA: Tabla player Mainak Biswas and photographer Kallab Ghosh, who accompanied Sarod player Shiraz Ali Khan for his December 19 concert at Chhayanaut in Bangladesh, found themselves in a precarious situation in Dhaka after the event was cancelled.Recounting 48 hours of intense anxiety they endured before finally managing to return home on December 22, Biswas said he had never felt so vulnerable in the neighbouring country, which he has earlier visited at least five times. He said he had always received warmth from the people of Bangladesh.“However, this visit turned into my worst nightmare. I could never have imagined how difficult life could become as a Hindu trapped in Bangladesh when anti-Indian rhetoric was at its peak,” said Biswas after his return to Kolkata.The tension, he said, was suffocating, and every moment was spent in anticipation of what could go wrong. “It is easy to identify me as an Indian. Hence, the fear of being targeted was ever-present. The ordeal is a constant reminder of the vulnerability.”“My mother and grandmother were at home in Kolkata. But I didn’t call them up to share my tension. I still feel a shiver down my spine when I recall those helpless hours,” Biswas recounted.“I had switched off my phone. My mind went blank when I learned what had happened to Dipu Das. I couldn’t fathom what might await me if a mob attacked me.”The situation became increasingly challenging after Shiraz’s departure. “He had reputation of a renowned musician and the advantage of a Khan surname. Unlike him, I couldn’t even speak local dialect. They say those who can’t speak have no enemies. I decided to remain silent and pretend I couldn’t speak. Shiraz’s mother was with us, and I had the added responsibility of ensuring her safety,” Biswas said.","Tabla player Mainak Biswas and photographer Kallab Ghosh found themselves in a precarious situation in Dhaka after the event was cancelled.

“A severe brain imbalance” - Joe Rogan urges Jake Paul to consider retiring early after suffering a double broken jaw,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/a-severe-brain-imbalance-joe-rogan-urges-jake-paul-to-consider-retiring-early-after-suffering-a-double-broken-jaw/articleshow/126160289.cms,"Joe Rogan and Jake Paul.

Joe Rogan gives his two cents on Jake Paul suffering a double broken jaw



Can Jake Paul fight Francis Ngannou next?



Social media star Jake Paul , who turned professional boxer, has been the talk of the sport ever since making his pro-debut back in 2020. Since then, he has taken on former basketball players, social media influencers, former MMA superstars, and professional boxers.While Paul has garnered a lot of criticism for his choice of opponents in the past, the criticism was somewhat put to bed when he took on Anthony Joshua last weekend. However, taking on a challenge like Joshua proved to be costly for ‘The Problem Child’ as he ended up suffering a double broken jaw.When Paul entered the ring against Joshua at the Kaseya Center in Miami, many thought he wouldn’t survive more than two rounds. However, he managed to latch on for six rounds and managed to land a few shots himself. In the process, he looked extremely drained and ultimately got knocked out.Shortly after the fight, it was revealed that Paul suffered a double broken jaw. Despite this, it looks like he aims to return to boxing late next year, even though the injury could force a lot of fighters into retirement. Speaking about the same, UFC commentator and world-renowned podcaster Joe Rogan had one piece of advice for Paul.During a recent episode of his podcast, Rogan suggested that ‘The Problem Child’ should consider retiring early after suffering such a devastating injury. While suggesting that it’s not worth it considering the cost it comes with, Rogan said, “It’s not worth it and that price is depression, deep depression. A severe brain imbalance that’s going to lead you to addiction. It leads so many people to impulsive behavior. ”It is safe to say that Rogan is coming from a place of concern. That said, it remains to be seen what’s next for Paul in his boxing career, which has garnered the attention of millions of people worldwide.Suffering a double broken jaw doesn’t seem to have slowed Paul down or his ambitions to take on big names inside the squared circle. Before his fight against Joshua, it was revealed that there were talks for a fight against Francis Ngannou; however, the latter turned the offer down.The landscape is certainly different now as Paul managed to survive longer than Ngannou in his fight against Joshua. While there’s no certainty surrounding the fight happening as of now, this could be a real conversation when Paul recovers from his double broken jaw.Also Read: “I Want To Get In That Ring” – Not Anthony Joshua, Jake Paul’s Mom Wanted To Punch British Promoter After Son’s Devastating Loss","Joe Rogan gives his two cents on Jake Paul suffering a double broken jaw.

A 2008 Ford F-150 and a Cadillac Escalade SUV fill the garage space of Indianapolis Colts veteran quarterback Philip Rivers

The two most important things in Philip Rivers’ life are family and football preparation

After more than 17 years in the NFL with the San Diego Chargers, Los Angeles Chargers, and Indianapolis Colts, eight-time Pro Bowler and NFL Comeback Player of the Year Philip Rivers has over 63,000 passing yards, 400 touchdowns, and a passer rating of 95.1.At 44, Rivers surprised everyone by coming out of retirement to play for his former team and the late Jim Irsay’s Colts. Now, two games into the 2025 season, he has amassed over 397 passing yards, three touchdowns, and a passer rating of 86.6.Rivers’ drive as a quarterback remains strong on the gridiron. What about his mode of transportation? What about his car collection? Two vehicles reportedly fill his garage: a 2008 Ford F-150 [some reports say F-250] and a Cadillac Escalade SUV. The customized SUV costs about $200,000, while his everyday Ford’s estimated cost is not publicly disclosed. Let’s take a closer look at them.Francisco Cruz of Ford Authority reported in April 2020, that despite earning $215 million as an NFL quarterback, Philip Rivers is driving a 2008 Ford F-150 pickup truck. Rivers drives a heavy-duty truck that is almost 17 years old now. The multi-millionaire star’s primary vehicle boasts a towing capacity over 9,000 pounds and has a 5.4L Triton V8 engine with 300 horsepower and 365 pound-feet of torque.It can easily carry six people. Higher-end model features include powered and heated leather seating, dual-zone automatic climate control, entertainment options such as a CD or DVD system, a large center console, and folding rear seats for cargo flexibility. In September 2017, Kevin Acee of the San Deigo Union-Tribune reported that Rivers’ primary mode of transportation is a 2008 Ford F-250.The second vehicle to catch attention is a Cadillac Escalade SUV. Rivers contacted the makers of high-end vehicles for Hollywood elites like Dr. Dre, Stevie Wonder Jerry Seinfeld , and Barbra Streisand . Reportedly costing close to $200,000, the SUV was customized by Becker Automotive Design in Oxnard, California, in 2017. Amenities include a 40-inch TV, refrigerator, two captain seats with Rivers’ No. 17 on one headrest, satellite TV, wireless internet, a fresh-air ventilation system, a professional quality sound system, and electric leg extensions.Rivers spoke about the SUV with the San Diego Union-Tribune in 2017. “My two biggest things were my family time and my preparation and what I owe this football team,” Rivers said. “I was not going to sacrifice either of them in any big proportion. I can look at all the pluses and minuses and say, ‘Okay, this does it.’This allows me to get home in six to seven hours, which is when I got home the last 11 years, and it allows me to watch all or more of the film I watched before. I don’t want it to be - he’s stuck in a car all day, maybe that’s why he struggled.” The father of ten may be currently using this Cadillac Escalade to prepare for Colts’ matchups.According to Spotrac, Rivers’ career earnings total $244.2 million as of December 2025. He signed a one-year, $1.255 million contract with the Indianapolis Colts for the 2025 season.

Chris Jones’ heartfelt tribute to Travis Kelce

Questions mount over what comes next for Travis Kelce

Also Read:

As speculation grows around Travis Kelce’s future in the NFL, an emotional message from longtime teammate Chris Jones has added fresh weight to the conversation. With the Kansas City Chiefs preparing to host the Denver Broncos, what could be Kelce’s final home game at Arrowhead Stadium has suddenly taken on deeper meaning.Ahead of Thursday night’s matchup, Jones spoke candidly about the possibility that Kelce may be playing his last game in front of the Arrowhead faithful. His words reflected both respect and uncertainty.“It’s sad… I hope it isn’t his last ride, but if it is, I tip my hat off to him. Hell of a career,” Jones said, acknowledging the gravity of the moment.The message resonated across the fanbase, especially given the Chiefs’ disappointing campaign that saw them fall out of playoff contention. For many, Jones’ remarks felt like a quiet acknowledgment that the Kelce era in Kansas City could be nearing its end.Kelce, now deep into a career that has redefined the tight end position, has remained non-committal about his future. The Chiefs’ struggles this season have only intensified retirement talk, particularly with the franchise entering an uncertain transition phase.Head coach Andy Reid did little to shut down the speculation when asked about Kelce’s status, though his praise for the veteran was unmistakable.“I don’t know if it is. I haven’t talked to him,” Reid said. “But his numbers, his personality, the person - I think speaks for themselves. Phenomenal person. Great for the community. He’s everything you want from a player representing an organization.”Those comments, while supportive, stopped short of offering clarity, leaving fans to read between the lines.Whether or not Kelce chooses to walk away after this season, his impact on the Chiefs is undeniable. From redefining the offense to serving as a locker-room leader, Kelce has been central to Kansas City’s modern identity. For teammates like Jones, the thought of seeing him step away is both emotional and inevitable.The Broncos game, now framed by nostalgia and uncertainty, could serve as a symbolic farewell, or simply another chapter in a storied career that isn’t quite ready to close.For now, Kelce’s focus remains on the field. But as Arrowhead prepares to roar one more time this season, Jones’ message has ensured that whatever happens next, Kelce’s legacy is already secure.","Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has remained non-committal about his future in the NFL.

Long sees two possible paths for Kelce and the Chiefs moving forward

Travis Kelce's Big Moment: Kyle Long Explores His Future Post-Mahomes Injury!

Back-to-back losses for the Kansas City Chiefs have now created a sense of uncertainty, and Patrick Mahomes ’ season-ending knee injury has forced fans, analysts, and even team players to ask uncomfortable questions about what comes next. The most significant being the future of Travis Kelce, who’s undoubtedly the most dominant tight end of his era and a central figure in Kansas City’s rise.Popular analyst Kyle Long recently gave his perspective on the situation at hand. By referencing parallels and similarities from a children’s novel, he asserted that Kelce and Mahomes need each other and are inseparable. With Mahomes now in limbo due to his injury, he placed the ball on Kelce’s court regarding the future prospects of the Chiefs’ performance on the field.During a recent conversation with Chiefs Wire’s Ed Easton Jr., retired All-Pro lineman and CBS Sports analyst Kyle Long offered a thoughtful and relatable perspective on Kelce’s situation. Long, who is part of Netflix’s NFL Christmas Gameday coverage, framed the Mahomes-Kelce partnership as one built on incredible chemistry and an unmatched dynamic.Long said, ""Well, there was a book I read when I was younger. It's called 'Where the Red Fern Grows'.It was about, I don't really know what it was about, but there were two dogs in it, and they were so dang close. They did everything together, they hunted together, they ate together, they slept together. And once, one of the dogs got hurt on a barbed-wire fence. The dog didn't make it.""Long’s point was very clear as Mahomes and Kelce have been inseparable on the field since 2018, redefining a bona fide elite quarterback-tight end combo. With Mahomes expected to miss extended time after surgery to repair his ACL and LCL, uncertainty now surrounds Kelce’s motivation and timeline.Long laid out some possibilities, stating, ""Are we going to see Travis Kelce, like he did this past offseason, train his butt off, come in the best shape of his life, be a top-five producing tight end in football, and wait for his homeboy (Patrick Mahomes) to show back up at quarterback? They can take some names and kick some butts…” It remains to be seen how Kelce and the Chiefs strike back with a bang after some big disappointments.Also read: Is week 17 Travis Kelce’s last home game?

Is Khamzat Chimaev’s cautious performance against Du Plessis enough to justify a superfight with Alex Pereira?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/is-khamzat-chimaevs-cautious-performance-against-du-plessis-enough-to-justify-a-superfight-with-alex-pereira/articleshow/126161735.cms,"The question of whether Khamzat Chimaev is prepared for a crucial battle against Alex Pereira has been raised by his cautious victory over Dricus Du Plessis. His safety-first wrestling strategy has been questioned by fans and commentators as to whether it could withstand Pereira's knockout power.After Pereira turned his attention to other superfights and Chimaev demanded a light heavyweight title chance, the conversation became more heated. Chimaev's next move is still being watched, with people like Ben Askren voicing concerns and Jon Jones joining the story.But we can't ignore Jon Jones, who has been winning over admirers with a much-anticipated return at the White House event. Despite Dana White's disdain, Alex Pereira has his sights set on him.

What made Khamzat Chimaev accept the challenge from Alex Pereira?

Khamzat Chimaev is a 31-year-old Russian-Emirati professional mixed martial artist and freestyle wrestler. Since entering the professional ranks in 2018, he has won six fights by knockout and six by submission, including a face crank, heel hooks, D'Arce chokes, and rear-naked chokes. His nickname, ""Borz,"" means ""Wolf"" in Chechen, and nine of his fights have ended in the first round.What shook fans was to see their unstoppable wrestling hero's performance against Dricus Du Plessis, cautious and safety-first, rather than aggressive or dominating. This has questioned his upcoming matchup with Alex Pereira. Chimaev's ‘bear-hugging’ style of wrestling and position control has lost spacks amongst his fans. They believe that such a strategy would not be effective against a powerful, high-risk striker like Alex Pereira.An incident happened right after Alex Pereira defeated Magomed Ankalaev to win the championship. Khamzat Chimaev immediately demanded a light heavyweight title match, sparking the exchange. Instead, Pereira turned his attention to a possible White House fight with Jon Jones, but Chimaev continued the discussion by suggesting a grappling contest, which the champion did not completely rule out.Ben Askren questioned Chimaev's remarks about increasing his weight as the allegations persisted, pointing to his recent welterweight appearances. Additionally, he cited Chimaev's careful strategy against Dricus Du Plessis, implying that a vulnerability was revealed by avoiding high-risk inputs.Positional control is not very safe against a striker such as Pereira. Even though both fighters seem open to a battle, Chimaev may find it challenging to engage in longer grappling exchanges due to his size advantage and ability to stop fights with a single clean strike.After ""Poatan's recent Ankalaev victory,"" ""Borz"" had a clear plan to derail Pereira and turn his focus back onto him. Alex Pereira did not shy away from a challenge. However, he prevented Chimaev from controlling the story this time. Rather, he proposed a grappling fight outside of the UFC, where he stands to win greatly and has nothing to lose.There were only two choices available to Chimaev: accept the round or refuse it and risk having his reputation harmed online. It's easy to figure out which choice he chose. As he replied to Glover Teixeira, ""Let's go, I can submit you both on the same night,"" he actually intensified the situation and added still another twist. Easy cashJon Jones also remains part of the conversation, having generated fan excitement with the possibility of a long-anticipated return at a White House event. Despite Dana White’s reservations, Alex Pereira has continued to express interest in facing him.Also Read: UFC chaos: Khamzat Chimaev confirms Dricus Du Plessis' injury news, Paddy Pimblett warns Belal Muhammad, Alex Pereira becomes viral bunny","Khamzat Chimaev is a 31-year-old Russian-Emirati professional mixed martial artist and freestyle wrestler.

With Christmas just a day away, let’s take a look at the best NBA matches that gave fans more joy than unwrapping gifts. Upholding the tradition that was started in 1947, NBA continues to give the audience a thrilling day full of top-notch matches. In the first-ever Christmas Day game, the New York Knicks hosted the Providence Steamrollers at Madison Square Garden and handed the latter an 89-75 loss.Christmas Day defines NBA’s festive history where the most bitter rivals meet, and every player that graces the hardwood plays with an extra chip on their shoulders, while everyone else is tucked in their pajamas while sipping hot chocolate. From a monstrous 60-point game to bitter ex-teammates settling scores on the rectangle, these games have become an inseparable part of this tradition tree. So, while the world is preparing for this season’s matchups, let’s look back at the iconic battles that truly defined holiday hoops.Fresh off winning the NBA championship against the Warriors, the Cavaliers hosted the runners-up at the Rocket Arena. With tension reaching the roof, this match was peak basketball. LeBron James came off the bench and dropped 31 points, 13 rebounds, and 4 assists while going 4-8 for threes and 12-22 from the field.Cavs overcame the 14-point fourth-quarter lead, with Kyrie Irving hitting an impossible fadeaway over Klay Thompson with seconds left on the game clock. The 109-108 clutch performance proved Cleveland was the real deal.This was the ultimate showdown between Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal after the latter left the franchise due to their long-standing feud. This return to Staples Center was more dramatic than ever. With tension so thick that it could be cut with a knife, Heat remained dominant and secured a 104-102 win over the Lakers in OT despite Kobe dropping 42 points. It has officially cemented itself as one of the most famous feuds of the 2000s.The Nets travelled all the way to MSG to face off against the Knicks. Both remained on equal footing through all three 3 quarters, but it was the 4th that sealed the fate for the Nets with a 120-114 win over the Knicks. Despite the loss, Bernard King gave the Knicks’ fans a lifetime gift when he went berserk and dropped 60 points, while shooting 19-of-30 from the field. King’s scoring ability has set itself as the gold standard for Christmas Day performances.This was truly a nail-biter game. With 3.3 seconds left on the clock, the Bulls had the win in their hands, but a blunder from Steve Kerr sent the game into OT. Michael Jordan was off to play baseball, so Scottie Pippen had to carry the torch. He played all 53 minutes and came up with two massive blocks in the final seconds during OT to secure a 107-104 win over the Knicks.Having Wilt Chamberlain on your team was basically a cheat code. The Big Dipper dropped 59 points while setting a Christmas Day record for rebounds with 26 in a double-overtime game. Even though the Philadelphia lost by one point close contest of 135-136, Wilt Chamberlain’s numbers remain an everlasting memory for every NBA fan.These games made a mark because they transcend the box score. They represent moments when the league's narrative shifted and a regular-season game into a legacy-defining event. From Shaq and Kobe’s public beef or Kyrie’s cold-blooded shot-making, Christmas Day basketball matters because it’s where legends are made, rivalries are settled, and the history of the game is written in real-time, and sometimes in over-time (OT).Also Read: 2025-26 NBA playoff chances: Boston Celtics climb rankings as Eastern Conference rivals tighten race for","Christmas Day defines NBA’s festive history where the most bitter rivals meet, and every player that graces the hardwood plays with an extra chip on their shoulders.

A former college athlete and kinesiology/fitness trainer by profession, she has always worked in health and wellness arenas concerned with sustainability rather than celebrity. It is assumed that she earns profits from fitness coaching, wellness consulting, and a few brand collaborations instead of endorsing mass brands.Considering Drew McIntyre's WWE income history plus everything Frohnapfel has earned over the years while working as a professional, the most realistic estimates of their combined wealth place it somewhere between roughly $3 million and $10 million.Also Read: Torrie Wilson and Justin Tupper combined net worth in 2025: WWE history, investments, and lifestyle","Drew McIntyre and Kaitlyn Frohnapfel are a fresh and new power couple.

Legal trouble further deepens career decline for Andrzej Wawrzyk



Once seen as one of Poland’s top heavyweight boxers, Andrzej Wawrzyk is now facing serious trouble far from the boxing ring. The 38-year-old has been detained in Sarasota County, Florida, in connection with a shoplifting case. His arrest has raised fresh concerns about his future in the United States and added another low point to a career that has steadily declined in recent years.Wawrzyk was once linked with title fights and major opportunities. He competed at a high level and carried strong expectations from fans back home. Today, his name no longer appears on fight posters but in police reports. With previous legal issues already on record, this latest incident could have consequences that go beyond fines or court dates.According to authorities, Andrzej Wawrzyk was taken into custody on suspicion of stealing items worth more than $300. Police also allege that he was carrying tools meant to bypass store security systems. In addition, he is accused of resisting a law enforcement officer, though officials say no violence was involved. Together, the charges paint a serious picture and suggest more than a simple misunderstanding.This is not Wawrzyk’s first legal problem in the United States.Back in 2023, he was arrested on similar theft-related charges in Chicago. The repeated nature of these incidents has now led to concerns that deportation proceedings could be considered. If that happens, Wawrzyk may no longer be allowed to remain in the country.His boxing career has also struggled. Wawrzyk last fought in February 2025, when he suffered a third-round TKO loss to Damian Knyba. That defeat marked his third straight loss and continued a long slump. Once a WBA “Regular” heavyweight title challenger, he now fights mainly to stay relevant.Controversy has followed him before. In 2017, Wawrzyk withdrew from a world title fight against Deontay Wilder after testing positive for a banned substance. His team disputed the test results and pointed to a clean follow-up test in Poland. Still, the damage to his reputation was done, and the title opportunity never returned.Despite everything, Wawrzyk’s record remains strong on paper. He has 34 professional wins, including 20 knockouts, and he was once a national champion.With deportation now a real possibility, his story is turning into a warning.Also Read: Andrew Tate’s brother Tristan Tate claims the boxer earned $52 million from misfits mania despite shocking defeat against Chase DeMoor","Andrzej Wawrzyk has been detained in Sarasota County, Florida, in connection with a shoplifting case.

PJ Hall to Charlotte Hornets? Team to add fresh frontcourt depth on two-way deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/pj-hall-to-charlotte-hornets-team-to-add-fresh-frontcourt-depth-on-two-way-deal/articleshow/126165440.cms,"PJ Hall was in Memphis Grizzlies (Image via NBA)

PJ Hall earns another NBA opportunity after strong G League showing with Greensboro Swarm

Charlotte Hornets add PJ Hall to boost frontcourt depth amid injuries and youth-focused rebuild

Agent Matt Bollero tells Ohm Youngmisuk of ESPN that the Hornets have reached a two-way agreement with center PJ Hall, giving depth to their frontcourt. Throughout the 2025–26 season, they maintained the team's emphasis on internal growth. Ohm Youngmisuk was the first to report the move, citing ProMondo Sports' confirmation.Hall has played for the Memphis Grizzlies in seven NBA games this season. He attended Clemson to play collegiate basketball. Additionally, the big man participated in 19 games for the Denver Nuggets in 2024–2025. Charlotte, however, hasn't advanced to the postseason since 2016. Since selecting LaMelo Ball with the third overall choice in the 2020 NBA Draft, the team has only had one winning record.Hall, a former Clemson All-ACC standout, inked a new two-way contract with the Grizzlies this past summer after spending his debut season on a two-way contract with Denver in 2024–2025. Before being dismissed in November to make place for Jahmai Mashack, he only played 27 minutes in seven games for Memphis this fall and 66 minutes in 19 games for the Nuggets the previous season.After being waived by the Grizzlies, Hall joined Charlotte's affiliate, the Greensboro Swarm, and has since made a significant contribution in the G League.The 6'8"" big man has averaged 14.8 points, 9.1 rebounds, 2.2 assists, and 1.5 blocks in 27.5 minutes per game in 14 appearances with the Swarm and Memphis Hustle.Announcing the news, the management wrote on X:“The Charlotte Hornets are signing PJ Hall to a two-way contract out of their Greensboro Swarm G League team, Matt Bollero of ProMondo Sports tells ESPN. Hall, who has played 26 NBA games over two seasons, is averaging 14.8 points and 9.1 rebounds on 62.3% shooting in G League…”After centres Ryan Kalkbrenner (left elbow sprain) and Mason Plumlee (right groin strain) were sidelined for Tuesday's victory over Washington, Hall will provide Hornets head coach Charles Lee with another middle option.Hall mainly served as a developmental big man for Denver, averaging 1.7 points and 1.2 rebounds in little minutes. Later, in July 2025, he signed a two-way contract with the Memphis Grizzlies, where he played in seven games until being dismissed in November due to a roster change.Hall's offensive skill set has been most evident in the G League. He has averaged 15.7 points and 8.6 rebounds per game in 10 G League games this season, demonstrating enhanced finishing touch and improved glass placement.After a successful run with the Greensboro Swarm, where he averaged 14.8 points and 9.1 rebounds while shooting 62.3% from the field, Hall was awarded the deal. In addition to Ryan Kalkbrenner, Mason Plumlee, and Moussa Diabate, the signing provides Charlotte with another interior option.The organisation has placed a strong emphasis on assessing younger players while preserving roster flexibility because the Hornets are currently 10-20. Moussa Diabate, Charlotte's only healthy centre, had an incredible performance against the Wizards, finishing with 12 points, 18 rebounds, and a +38 rating in 36 minutes.However, during his 12 minutes on the bench, the club was outscored by 21 points, and if Kalkbrenner or Plumlee are likely to miss more time, the team could utilise more reinforcements at the five. Drew Peterson, a two-way forward, was waived by the Hornets to make room for Hall.Over the last two seasons, Hall has made a number of stops on his NBA journey. He joined the Denver Nuggets for Summer League after going undrafted in the 2024 NBA Draft. He eventually signed a two-way contract and made 19 appearances in the 2024–25 campaign.Also read: Washington Wizards vs Charlotte Hornets (12-23-2025) game preview: When and where to watch, expected lineup, injury report, prediction, and more","PJ Hall has played for the Memphis Grizzlies in seven NBA games this season.

Nyjah Huston continues to keep focus on his Olympic Dreams ahead of LA28



Nyjah Huston was spotted skating through Los Angeles International Airport recently, showing that his love for street skating never takes a break. The Olympic medalist cruised through the terminal on his skateboard while answering questions. Surprisingly, airport staff did not seem bothered by it. Huston said many workers are relaxed about him rolling through, making travel quicker and more fun for the skateboarding legend.Away from airports, Huston is also focused on the future of his sport. Widely regarded as one of the greatest street skateboarders ever, the 30-year-old is already thinking about the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. With the Games returning to Southern California, Huston says the location gives him extra motivation to continue competing at the highest level.Nyjah Huston believes airports could easily double as skateparks.“The airport would be sick to skate around. Surprisingly, they’re pretty chill about us cruising around”, Huston said.He added that reactions can differ depending on where he is, “Some people get pissed, I’m not gonna lie, but hey, it saves a lot of time.”Over the years, he has skated in many unusual places, including casinos and nightclubs. Still, one style remains his favorite.“Nothin’ beats street skating - especially here in L.A. It’s just so classic,” Huston added.Born in Northern California, Huston stepped on a skateboard at just three years old. He won his first competition by age 10. Inspired by Los Angeles skate videos, he moved to Southern California at 15. Now living in Laguna Beach, he remains deeply tied to the area.Huston competed at the Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024 Olympics. He admitted Tokyo was overwhelming. “It was the first time ever that we’re skating for our country, which means a lot to me, and was something that was totally new to skateboarding,” he said. In Paris, he adjusted his mindset and won bronze. “I tried to go into Paris more with an open mind and said ‘Let’s just see how it goes,’” he said.Despite Olympic success, Huston believes skateboarding is more than medals. “In my eyes, skateboarding is more of a lifestyle than it is a sport, more of a way of life,” he said.Looking ahead, his goal is simple: to be able to grind rails even when she is 60-70 years old.Also Read: Formula 1 2026 chaos begins early as Ferrari challenges Mercedes’ new engine power advantage",Olympic medalist Nyjah Huston was spotted skating through Los Angeles International Airport.

Breaking down Joel Embiid’s payday



How Joel Embiid’s Supermax Hits the 76ers’ Salary Cap



Joel Embiid’s addition to the Philadelphia 76ers roster was all due to GM Sam Hinkie, who believed in his controversial strategy, “The Process.” Eventually, with time, Embiid embraced the same strategy as his nickname. But he isn’t just the ""Process"" anymore, rather, he has become one of the highest-salaried NBA players this season and Philly's biggest investment.In the 2014 NBA draft, the 76ers chose Joel Embiid as their third overall pick, but the Jayhawks’ star had to miss his first two NBA seasons because of injuries. But upon his return in 2016, Embiid showed he was worth the wait when he averaged 20.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.1 assists and shot 46.6% from the field. Through 2014-17, Joel Embiid earned an average salary of $4.9 million as per his $19.8 million rookie contract. This contract paved the way for Embiid’s 2017 “supermax” rookie contract worth $148 million.Philadelphia’s intentions are clear about Joel Embiid: they want to keep this elite talent at home.Currently, Joel Embiid is under a 4-year $213 million veteran extension contract with the 76ers in 2012 that gives him an annual salary of $55.2 million for the 2025-26 season while carrying a cap hit of $55 million.This contract will keep at Philadelphia through the 2026-27.In September 2024, the 2023 MVP reportedly, signed a three-year maximum extension worth $193 million with a player option keeping him home through 2028-29. This extension solidified Joel's legendary status as the franchise's pillar and appreciated his loyalty and commitment towards 76ers. Along this because of the new extension, Joel Embiid’s annual salary will jump up to a staggering $62.7 million for the 2026-27 season, pushing his career earnings to a projected total over $500 million by the end of the 2028 season, which is currently at $321 million.Through this deal, Embiid is ready to enter the exclusive club, joining legends like LeBron James and Stephen Curry as the only players to surpass $500 million in career earnings, showcasing how an exceptional talents needs an exceptional contract.The next hurdle that teams in the league are facing post awarding their players with astronomical contracts, is the NBA’s luxury tax. The threshold for this season is $187.8 million, with more penalties and restrictions for any offenders.Philly’s total salary for this season is estimated at around $194.9 million, incurring a $7.3 million in luxury tax. Embiid’s deal consumes a significant amount of the team's total cap space, leaving a thin margin, and with the league’s stricter rules, the franchise has limited flexibility in free agency. Every contract going forward will have to be precise because they have traded their financial flexibility for the unguardable Joel Embiid.Also Read: Kevin Durant NBA contract details: Total earnings, salary cap, and more","Joel Embiid has become one of the highest-salaried NBA players this season.

Bryce Hall and Kick streamer Clavicular’s online fallout after viral livestream clip







warning to Kick streamer Braden “Clavicular.” The clash began after Hall shared a clip from Clavicular’s IRL livestream on December 23, 2025. In the video, Clavicular was seen speaking to a woman at what looked like a party.Hall reacted strongly to the clip and mocked the streamer online. The situation escalated when Hall said he would not tolerate any disrespect toward his girlfriend. His comments triggered a wider debate among creators about boundaries. The argument then moved from posts on X to livestream reactions, pulling in other controversial internet personalities.The controversy began when Bryce Hall reposted a short clip from Clavicular’s livestream. In the video, the streamer made forward and crude remarks toward a woman during a party interaction. Hall later said he had only recently learned who Clavicular was, adding that the repeated clips he saw were extremely embarrassing and hard to watch, which is why he shared them.Internet personality Nico “Sneako” stepped in and questioned Hall’s intentions. He suggested Hall was trying to tear down a younger creator.Hall pushed back and said he was not attacking Clavicular but offering a moment to grow. He added that approaching women at parties in a sexual way, especially while minors could be watching, was not good content. Hall also said he hoped the criticism would be taken as advice rather than a personal attack.Soon after, Hall posted again and drew a hard line. He said insults aimed at him did not matter. But if anyone spoke about his girlfriend in a disrespectful way, he would respond physically. He added that Clavicular should enjoy his stream, tagging him directly.Clavicular responded live on stream the same day. He brushed off Hall’s comments and claimed the woman in the clip was someone he already knew well. He said the interaction was being misunderstood and insisted he had behaved more respectfully on camera than off it.He also dismissed Hall’s relevance, saying people no longer cared about him and that his influence was in the past. He challenged claims that he was lying and said he could prove his point.As of now, Bryce Hall has not replied to Clavicular’s latest remarks.

Mamiko Tanaka built her identity long before global attention

Mamiko Tanaka did not enter the public eye because of her marriage. Her life already had structure, purpose, and years of work behind it before her name became familiar to baseball fans around the world. Long before she was known as the wife of a global sports icon, Tanaka had built her own identity through professional basketball in Japan.When she later married Shohei Ohtani , attention followed naturally. Cameras appeared. Interest grew. Yet Tanaka’s story did not begin there. Her calm presence today is rooted in a past shaped by discipline, routine, and competition far away from any spotlight.Born on December 11, 1996, Tanaka grew up balancing academics and athletics. She attended Waseda University, one of Japan’s most respected institutions, where playing basketball demanded commitment both on the court and in the classroom. The environment was intense and structured, and it helped shape her steady approach to sport and life.In 2019, she turned professional and joined the Fujitsu Red Wave in the Women’s Japan Basketball League. The move marked a major step. Professional basketball in Japan offers few shortcuts, and places are earned through consistency.Standing 5 foot 11, Tanaka played as a forward and became known for her reliability rather than highlight moments.Over four seasons with the Red Wave, she built trust within the team. Coaches valued her decision-making. Teammates relied on her composure. In her final season before retiring in 2023, Tanaka shot 47.7 percent from the field and 69.9 percent from the free-throw line across 28 games. The numbers reflected preparation and control, not flash.Her retirement came quietly. There were no long announcements and no public farewell. She stepped away from professional basketball without noise, closing one chapter on her own terms. At the time, her name remained largely within Japanese basketball circles.That changed in February 2024 when Ohtani announced his marriage through a simple social media post. While the news traveled quickly, Tanaka remained the same. During a press conference, Ohtani described her as a normal Japanese woman, a line that matched the life she had lived before public attention arrived.Since then, her appearances have been limited and measured. Whether walking beside Ohtani at official events or supporting him from the stands, Tanaka has carried herself with quiet confidence. Being a former basketball player and now the wife of one of the greatest baseball players, Mamiko Tanaka has built a life shaped by hard work and balance.Also read: Shohei Ohtani and Mamiko Tanaka’s networth in 2025: Los Angeles Dodgers star’s earnings, salary, family life, and more","Mamiko Tanaka grew up balancing academics and athletics.

A brief Hard Knocks moment that revealed how Dak Prescott leads when things are hard

The Dallas Cowboys did not expect a somber atmosphere as December is about to come to a close. Between a Christmas Day game streaming on Netflix and HBO’s in-season Hard Knocks focusing on the NFC East, Dallas has become one of the league’s most visible teams. The season opened with championship-level expectations but delivered shocking losses, uneven execution, and growing tension in the team dynamics.Amidst the frustrations, QB Dak Prescott recently had an inspiring and generous statement to share with his teammates. The QB put the focus on the support staff that has supported them time and time again, despite the results, and urged the team to make donations to them for the holidays.This show of inspiring leadership and big-heartedness from Prescott was seen in a short teaser from this week’s Hard Knocks episode. The QB stood in front of his teammates with a message that had nothing to do with the team’s stats. He encouraged players to donate money toward bonuses for the Cowboys’ support staff.Prescott pushed the group to give generously and reminded them “not to hold back during the holidays.” The clip struck a nerve with fans because it showed awareness at a time when frustration could easily turn inward.NFL support staff often work grueling hours with little public recognition, and their compensation does not always match the demands of the job.The NFL Players Association has raised this issue repeatedly, and Prescott’s message felt like action following those words. The Hard Knocks doc has shown the emotional weight of a season for the Cowboys that has not gone the way they hoped. In that environment, Prescott’s gesture reflected an understanding captain who is aware of the environment around himIt also offered fans a different lens through which to view the team. Moments like this showcase why Prescott continues to command respect and is admired by his teammates. His ability to recognize people who are vital for the team’s stability and take care of them whenever he can shows his incredible quality as a leader and is a moment of levity amidst the disappointments.Also read: “This is our job”: Dallas Cowboys QB Dak Prescott refuses to cheat the game after being eliminated from the 2025 NFL Playoffs",Dak Prescott urged his teammates to donate money toward bonuses for the Cowboys' support staff.

Marc-Andre Fleury's comeback rumor dominates Oilers' goaltending solutions

The NHL rumor mill is buzzing again. All because people are talking about retired goalie Marc-Andre Fleury again. This is because the Edmonton Oilers' crease is still up in the air. As the regular season comes to a close, teams all over the league are reevaluating their depth and experience at important positions.Fleury, who will be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame and is one of the most famous players in modern NHL history, officially retired after the 2023–24 season. But, according to recent insider talk, the veteran goalie hasn't completely closed the door on a return. Especially if it fits with his personal and competitive goals.Several NHL insiders say that Marc-Andre Fleury is open to the idea of coming back if the right conditions are met. This has led to more speculation about teams that need immediate help in goal. People often say that the Edmonton Oilers would be a good fit because they want to win the Stanley Cup and have a lot of experience in their core group. This season, they have had trouble being consistent in goal.People have been talking about the Oilers' goaltending because it hasn't been consistent enough to win close NHL games. Edmonton's management is still looking into traditional fixes like trades and call-ups, but the idea of bringing in a proven veteran like Fleury is appealing in a different way.For Edmonton, this situation is still only a possibility, not a reality. There is no proof that formal talks have happened, and Fleury has not said publicly that he will return. Still, in a league where trade rumors often come true because of injuries or poor play, the possibility is still there.Whether or not Marc-Andre Fleury makes a surprise return or stays retired, the fact that his name is linked to Edmonton shows how badly the Oilers need stability in net.His potential return would instantly boost team morale and provide invaluable leadership for Edmonton’s playoff push this season.Also Read: Net worth of Auston Matthews in 2025: Details on Toronto Maple Leafs captain's earnings, salary, and contracts","Marc-Andre Fleury's name is being linked to the Edmonton Oilers.

Mathieu van der Poel foils the crowd’s attempts to distract him in Belgium

Mathieu van der Poel keeps his 100% win record with a victory at the UCI World Cup in Koksijde!

Mathieu van der Poel once again showed his mental strength and racing class in Belgium. The reigning world champion won the X2O Badkamers Trofee race in Hofstade. It was his fourth victory in four cyclo-cross races since returning this season. The event marked the fourth round of the series, which had returned after a 17-year break and attracted a large crowd.The race ended with controversy. As Van der Poel charged toward the finish line on the final lap, a spectator leaned over the barriers and blew vape smoke directly into his face. For a brief moment, Van der Poel turned his head. He then looked forward again and kept riding. Wearing his racing glasses, he appeared calm and crossed the line first despite the distraction.Even with the interruption, Mathieu van der Poel finished 48 seconds ahead of Wout van Aert. Niels Vandeputte took third place. After the race, Van der Poel spoke about what happened near the finish line.“Yes, I felt it. That was right after the finish, wasn’t it? I don’t know if it was intentional, because I didn’t see,” he told reporters.Christoph Roodhooft, the team manager of Wout van Aert, also commented on the situation.He said, “I didn’t see it, but those are silly things. I don’t really want to say anything more about it. Isn’t reacting to something so stupid just plain stupid? It’s simply inappropriate and improper… It’s a shame that something so small gets so much attention. All the riders were very positive; this is a fantastic course… That’s much more important to take home than an action like this. ”Unfortunately, this was not an isolated incident for Van der Poel. In recent years, he has faced repeated crowd interference. Spectators have thrown beer and allegedly urine at him during cyclo-cross and road races. At Paris-Roubaix in April 2025, a spectator threw a full water bottle into his face. He was also spat at during the E3 Saxo Classic and had a cap thrown into his wheels at the 2024 Paris-Roubaix.After the Hofstade race, Van der Poel downplayed the vape smoke incident.“I saw it too, but I don’t know if it was on purpose. It didn’t really bother me. In any case, it’s better than beer,” he said.However, he has not always stayed calm. At the 2023 Cyclo-Cross World Cup in Hulst, he reacted after repeated abuse. Riders and officials have started to call for stronger action to stop dangerous fan behavior.Also Read: Who was Masashi “Jumbo” Ozaki?

Different versions emerge as the league takes a hard stance

Also Read:

The fallout from DK Metcalf’s sideline altercation with a fan has continued to ripple across the NFL, and one of the most direct responses has now come from inside the Pittsburgh locker room. Veteran player Cam Heyward did not mince words while addressing the two-game suspension handed to DK Metcalf, offering a message that was equal parts understanding and firm accountability.The incident occurred during the Steelers’ Week 16 win over the Detroit Lions, when Metcalf was caught on camera engaging in a heated exchange with a fan seated near the sideline. While officials missed the moment in real time, the league did not. After reviewing the footage, the NFL suspended Metcalf without pay for violating its strict policy against players entering the stands or making physical contact with fans.Speaking on his Not Just Football podcast, Heyward acknowledged the reality players face from the stands but stressed that certain boundaries can never be crossed.“Fans say some crazy stuff,” Heyward said. “I’ve heard a lot over the years. But you never put your hands on anybody.”The longtime Steelers captain revealed that most players on the sideline were unaware of what had transpired until after the game. Even so, Heyward was clear that while verbal abuse can take an emotional toll, physical retaliation is never an option in today’s NFL.“You don’t want to be treated like a caged animal,” he added. “But there’s a responsibility that comes with the platform we have.”The controversy has been further complicated by differing versions of events. A source close to Metcalf claimed the fan used racial slurs and made derogatory comments about the wide receiver’s family. The fan, however, has denied those allegations through legal representation.Regardless of what was said, the league’s stance was decisive. Metcalf will forfeit more than $555,000 in salary due to the suspension, and reports suggest the incident could also impact future guarantees tied to his contract. While the Pittsburgh Steelers have publicly backed Metcalf, the financial and reputational stakes are significant.Heyward stopped short of excusing his teammate but also redirected part of the conversation toward fan conduct. He emphasized that respect must work both ways.“There’s responsibility as a fan too,” Heyward said. “We don’t talk about people’s families. We don’t talk about them as individuals.”It was a measured stance from one of the league’s most respected voices, acknowledging the pressures players face while reinforcing that professionalism must prevail.As Metcalf prepares to serve his suspension and the Steelers adjust their plans without one of their top offensive weapons, Heyward’s message stands out for its clarity. In a league increasingly scrutinized for player-fan interactions, his words underscored a simple truth: emotions may run high, but crossing that line comes at a steep cost.",Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver DK Metcalf was suspended for two games after an altercation with a fan on the sideline.

"5 NBA Players with the highest salary in 2025-26: Joel Embiid, Stephen Curry, and more",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/5-nba-players-with-the-highest-salary-in-2025-26-joel-embiid-stephen-curry-and-more/articleshow/126163626.cms,"Joel Embiid, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant (Images via Getty)

1. Stephen Curry – $59.6 Million ( Golden State Warriors )



2. Joel Embiid – $55.2 Million ( Philadelphia 76ers )



3. Nikola Jokic – $55.2 Million ( Denver Nuggets )



4. Kevin Durant – $54.7 Million ( Houston Rockets )



5. Giannis Antetokounmpo – $54.1 Million ( Milwaukee Bucks )



If one compares the modern NBA salary to what it was in the 90s, the difference is astronomical. A million bucks in the 90s era would have broken the headlines, whereas in today’s time, a million bucks is what college students earn through NIL evaluation. With steady speed, the league continued to gain popularity, and with each passing decade, the salary cap hit an all-time high. Around 60 players are set to earn at least $30 million in salary this year.The NBA’s new media rights deal is rolling in big billion bucks, influencing and impacting the individual contracts while raising them to staggering amounts. The 2025-26 season has marked a historic peak in the league's economy, where the ""supermax"" contracts weren’t just increments, they showed the cream of the crop. These five players just do not play on the court, they are the flag bearers of their franchise and the leading face of their global fan club. Here’s who is taking home the biggest cheque of the season.It is no surprise that Chef Curry is placed at the top. He has ruled the list of the NBA’s highest-salaried players since 2017-18 and continues to do so. The greatest three-point shooter that the court has ever witnessed, Curry sits atop, soaking in all the appreciation with 4,161 three made over the span of 17 years.Even at 37, Steph is a legend being made in real time, and the Warriors know his worth.With $59.6 million set to be earned by the end of this season, Curry is the first player to ever push the boundaries toward that $60 million-a-year mark. For Golden State, Stephen Curry is more than a player, he represents loyalty, brand, and global exposure. Let’s not overlook the fact that Curry strikes fear into every opponent on the hardwood.Philadelphia’s GM’s embodiment of the strategic ""The Process,” Joel Embiid, has converted into one of the league’s biggest stars. Tied for the second spot with the Joker, Embiid, with his MVP status and 7 All-Star appearances, is set to earn $55.2 million this season.Despite the injury concerns, Embiid’s versatility at both ends of the court is undeniable, and this skill set has pushed him to become Philly’s undisputed face.Tied with Embiid at $55.2 per season, Nikola Jokic has proved that he’s worth every single penny. Nicknamed the Joker due to a pronunciation error, Joker is truly an unpredictable force on the court. Standing at 6 ft 11, Jokic might be listed as a center, but he has refined what centers could, and the Denver Nuggets will not let go of this generational talent.Kevin Durant defies every stereotype that suggests players slow down with age. Despite being in the later part of his career, KD remains one of the most efficient ""walking buckets"" in basketball history. After his move to Houston, he acts as a stabilizing agent for their young roster while dropping elite numbers. Equipped with killer ball-handling skills along with a blessed height, he can shoot from both inside and outside the arc. Durant’s contract proves that his game is truly timeless.Rounding out the top five is the Bucks’ ""Greek Freak.” Giannis Antetokounmpo’s 2025 season might not go in the most expected way due to injury, but this unstoppable force remains one of the highest-paid players this season. Giannis is the heartbeat of Milwaukee’s offense and defense. His play is a blend of immense raw physical power, along with his exceptional skills, that make any opponent fear him. Even with the ongoing trade rumors, Giannis Antetokounmpo remains Bucks’ hope to keep their championship window open.While these figures might make the head spin, it is advisable not to forget that they are backed by a player’s relentless efforts and decisions, and are a reflection of their skill set. And with each passing season, the salary caps will continue to climb even higher and will serve as proof of the league’s growth.Also Read: 5 Best NBA Christmas games of all time","The NBA's new media rights deal is rolling in big billion bucks, influencing and impacting the individual contracts.

She framed the comment as a personal preference and a reflection of where she sees her life heading. However, the clip quickly became a talking point across platforms like X, drawing strong reactions from both critics and supporters.As the clip spread, many users began offering opinions on Valkyrae’s choices, with some calling her outlookor predicting she would end up lonely. Others defended her right to choose a career-focused life without marriage or children.

Why Bryce Pickford earned a long-term commitment from Montreal Canadiens



Defenceman Bryce Pickford has been signed by the Montreal Canadiens, and a three-year entry-level contract was announced by the team on Wednesday. The agreement will take effect in the 2026–27 season, thereby allowing Montreal to further evaluate the player through junior hockey before he moves on to the big leagues.With a perfect combination of offense and defense, the 19-year-old player is now the captain of the Medicine Hat Tigers and is already giving the performances of the highest level across the league, which is why he is getting the most attention. The signing has been confirmed by Montreal's general manager, Kent Hughes, who has also reiterated the team’s strategic plan to incorporate youth in its roster.The Medicine Hat Tigers’ frontman has been a leading factor in the Canadiens’ decision. He is the leading scorer in the league with 25 goals and has also provided 19 assists for a total of 44 points in just 31 WHL games this season. His score is at the top of the league, while his point production is considered one of the best in the WHL, irrespective of the player's position.Moreover, the guy from Edmonton is about to reach another personal record as he merely needs three more points to tie his previous high of 47 points that he had scored last season. Even though it is Pickford’s 4th year in the WHL, he has been constantly growing and adapting to the NHL development staff’s requirements, which are the qualities they seek in prospects.Having won WHL titles in consecutive seasons, Pickford also brings championship experience to the team. He started with the Seattle Thunderbirds, and after winning the Ed Chynoweth Cup, he went on to complete another championship run with the Medicine Hat Tigers last season.The Canadiens picked Pickford in the third round, 81st overall, in the 2025 NHL Draft, and he quickly proved that the selection was right by his further development.The signing of Bryce Pickford to a three-year entry-level contract by the Montreal Canadiens has ensured that a defensive player of high potential with offensive production and good leadership who is still at the junior level has been obtained.Also Read: Cale Makar net worth 2025: NHL achievements, Career, contracts, prize money, endorsements and more","Bryce Pickford has been signed by the Montreal Canadiens, and a three-year entry-level contract was announced by the team on Wednesday.
