BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh high court declined permission for medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) of a 16-year-old rape survivor who is 29-weeks pregnant after she expressed her wish to give birth to the child.""The victim has categorically denied consent for termination of pregnancy and wants to continue with the pregnancy as she has solemnised marriage with the accused. The parents have disowned the victim,"" the bench of Justice Vishal Mishra noted in the recent order.The judge directed Child Welfare Committee of Sehore district to take care of the survivor and her child till the former turns 18. The court took up the case suo motu based on a reference from Sehore district court.""In view of the fact that the victim has refused termination of pregnancy and wants to continue with it, this court is of the view that permission for termination cannot be given. The delivery will be carried out in the presence of an expert team of doctors at Hamidia Hospital in Bhopal,"" Justice Mishra said.The court referred to a report of a medical board that advised against MTP at such an advanced stage of pregnancy, suggesting it could be risky for both the girl and the child. It also highlighted that a four-member counselling team had provided guidance to the survivor and recorded her and her parents' statements.",Madhya Pradesh high court declines permission for medical termination of pregnancy. 16-year-old rape survivor is 29-weeks pregnant and wants to give birth to the child.

""People Who Are..."" MEA Responds To Viral Mallya And Modi “Biggest Fugitive” Video

NEW DELHI: Reacting to a video that surfaced showing fugitives Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya at a party in London, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Friday reiterated that India remains firmly committed to bringing back individuals wanted by law to face justice in the country.“We remain fully committed that people who are fugitive and are wanted by law in India, they return to the country. For this particular return, we are in talks with several governments, and processes are on,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters at a weekly briefing in New Delhi.He added that there were several legal processes involved, but reiterated the government’s commitment to ensuring the return of such individuals to India.""As you know, in several of these cases, several layers of legalities are involved. But we remain committed to bring them back to the country so they can face trials before the court here,"" Jaiswal said.The MEA’s remarks come days after Lalit Modi shared a video on Instagram from Mallya’s 70th birthday celebrations, in which he referred to himself and his fellow fugitive as the “two biggest fugitives from India.”“Let me do something to break the internet again. Happy birthday my friend #VijayMallya.Love u,” he wrote in the caption.Modi hosted the celebration at his upscale six-bedroom residence in London’s Belgrave Square, among the most expensive neighbourhoods in the UK. Several of Mallya’s associates travelled from India to attend the party.Mallya, who turned 70 on December 18, is the former owner of the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines and previously owned the Bengaluru franchise in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He left India for the UK in 2016 after multiple cases were filed against him over alleged financial irregularities and loan defaults involving thousands of crores of rupees.Modi, a former cricket administrator and the founder of the IPL, left India in 2010 after investigations were launched into alleged financial misconduct and irregularities during the league’s early years.",A video surfaced showing fugitives Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya at a party in London.

NEW DELHI: The year 2025 is drawing to an end and most people are busy figuring out the New Year's resolutions. Every new year promises change and every December claims a reset.This year, India moved fast, yet some headlines felt like deja vu.In some cases, the names, dates and locations changed, but the storylines did not - a dominant BJP , a drifting Congress , toxic Delhi air, Pakistan‑linked terror. Several themes remained the same, think: sexist soundbites by netas, language wars and renaming frenzies.In 2025, BJP once again proved that the default setting of India remains “saffron”. The party registered emphatic wins in both Delhi and Bihar – two very different, politically crucial states.In February, BJP ended its Delhi drought and stormed back to power after 27 years. It won 48 of 70 assembly seats with around 46% vote share. The incumbent AAP government slumped to 22 seats and got around 44%.In Bihar, where the NDA was fighting an anti‑incumbency wave, the alliance swept the assembly with 202 of 243 seats. The BJP emerged as the single-largest party with 89 seats. The party got nearly 21% vote share.In Maharashtra, the BJP-led Mahayuti won 207 municipal councils and nagar panchayat seats of the 288, securing a single largest majority.The BJP won most of them, securing 117 seats, Shiv Sena 53 and NCP 37 seats. Congress won 28 seats.As the results were counted on various days for different elections, the headline still read - BJP starts favourite, BJP finishes first.If BJP’s script stayed familiar, so did the Congress’s. The party’s national brand continued to underperform even where local anger against incumbents was visible.This year, after failing to even open the account in the Delhi elections, the party held the AICC meet in Ahmedabad in April. Same age-old issues were raised: call to rebuild the organisation from booth‑level, sharpen the party’s ideological pitch beyond anti‑BJP rhetoric and regain lost ground in the Hindi belt.But again in Bihar, Congress managed to win only 6 seats with 8.7% vote share.This year, the Congress story, yet again, remained about its potential and plans rather than outcomes.Election after election, the analysis throughout the year kept throwing up the same words: ""fragmented"", ""faction‑ridden"", “no ground-level connection”.Cricket fandom in 2025 remained addicted to its favourite off‑field sport - guessing when India’s modern greats will walk away from the field.After announcing retirement from the T20 format last year, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli played reduced schedules. However, every match, series, or dip in form or rest sparked ""is this his last?"" debate.But RoKo ended the year as No. 1 and 2 batsmen in ICC ODI rankings. The duo were also back with a bang in the domestic Vijay Hazare Trophy after years.At home, MS Dhoni, long retired from international cricket but still a Chennai Super Kings totem, stayed in the retirement gossip each IPL match. Talking about reading too much into it, people went crazy this year over his t-shirt ahead of the IPL season that had ""one last time"" written in Morse code.He obviously went on to play in 2025 and also took over as CSK skipper mid-season after captain Ruturaj Gaikwad suffered an injury.From Diwali to winter, it was the same story in Delhi once again. By December, the city’s AQI remained in the “severe” to “hazardous” range for days at a stretch. GRAP restrictions were imposed repeatedly, cycling through Stages 1, 2, 3 and 4. One analysis showed sustained AQI levels above 500 through mid‑December, with peaks over 600 and no meaningful dips into safer categories, underscoring that this was not a one‑day spike but a chronic toxic wall.Flights were delayed, schools moved online, construction bans returned, and familiar visuals of masked children, disappearing India Gate and grey skylines flooded the feeds.Experts once more cited the same cocktail: winter inversion, low wind, vehicle and industrial emissions, and stubble burning. Policy responses remained reactive and short‑term.With this, the headline seemed copy‑pasted from almost any winter in the past decade: “Delhi chokes”, ""Delhi turns gas chamber"", ""Delhi air turns red"".In 2022, when Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman was asked about the sliding rupee, she had said: ""I would not look at it as rupee sliding, I would look at it as dollar strengthening.""In 2025, the rupee quietly set fresh records for weakness against the US dollar. After relative stability, it fell to an all‑time low of Rs 91 in December.The rupee has slid by 5-6% so far this year, making it Asia’s worst-performing currency this year.Addressing the concerns, the finance minister stated earlier this month: ""The rupee will find its own level.Meanwhile, analysts point to a wider trade deficit, foreign portfolio outflows, and Donald Trump’s 50% tariffs on Indian goods for the slide.2025 did not break the pattern of Pakistan‑linked terrorism. On April 22, a terrorist attack near Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir killed 26 civilians, mostly Hindu tourists. The probe revealed that the mastermind of the attack was a Lashkar‑e‑Taiba offshoot, The Resistance Front.This was followed by India's strong response with Operation Sindoor in which the missiles destroyed the terror infrastructure linked to Jaish‑e‑Mohammed and Lashkar‑e‑Taiba in Pakistan and the Pakistan‑occupied Kashmir region.Islamabad once again refused to own up while its Army majors were seen attending funerals of the terrorists.The headline “Terror strains India–Pakistan ties yet again” remained sadly accurate.If there is one genre of political controversy that never goes out of fashion, it is misogynistic remarks by our leaders. This year gave us multiple examples, cutting across parties and states. In early January, BJP MP Ramesh Bidhuri drew outrage for a sexist comment about Priyanka Gandhi, prompting Congress and AAP leaders to call it proof of a “deeply anti-women” mindset.“Lalu said in Bihar that he would make roads like Hema Malini’s cheeks, but he lied, he could not do it. I assure you that just as we made the roads in Okhla and Sangam Vihar, we will make all the roads in Kalkaji like Priyanka Gandhi’s cheeks,” Bidhuri had said.In Kerala, a CPI(M) leader won a panchayat seat, took out a victory rally, and said that “women are only for sleeping with husbands”.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar stirred a row by pulling the naqab of a hijab-wearing woman at an event. What followed was even more disturbing. BJP leader Giriraj Singh defended the CM’s act, saying Kumar had behaved like a “guardian” and that the woman could take the job or “go to hell”. Bihar governor Arif Mohammad Khan also spoke along similar lines and added that Nitish “considers female students his daughters”.This year, Bihar also threw up other such moments. Nitish found himself in trouble after saying, “Girls have become so confident. They speak so well and dress up so well. Did we see them wearing such fine clothes earlier?”RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad Yadav, too, passed a lewd remark about Nitish, suggesting he was participating in a women’s rally to “ogle at women”. “Nayan sekne ja rahe hain,” he said when asked about Nitish’s Mahila Samvad Yatra.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee also invited criticism after resorting to victim-blaming while defending her government following a gangrape case. “Why was she out at midnight?” Mamata asked.The response cycle was identical each time: viral clip > outrage > absurd defence > forgotten. The headline “Neta’s sexist remarks trigger storm” could have been reused almost every month.India’s language politics remained combustible. In 2025, much of the heat centred on school language policy and perceived “Hindi imposition” in non‑Hindi states. In Maharashtra, a BJP‑led government's move to make Hindi compulsory from Class 1 to 5 triggered a backlash.Parallel debates raged in southern states over NEP’s three‑language formula and the balance between English, regional languages and Hindi with Tamil Nadu MK Stalin taking the charge. The core storyline of the “language war” – Centre‑pushed Hindi vs regional pride and access concerns – remained unchanged.Renaming towns, villages and roads stayed a favourite symbolic tool. In 2025, Uttarakhand grabbed headlines by renaming 11 places across four districts, replacing names like Aurangzebpur and Mohammadpur Jat with Shivaji Nagar, Mohanpur Jat, Shri Krishnapur, Ambedkar Nagar and Jyotiba Phule Nagar, among others.The finale came during the Winter session of Parliament when the Centre came up with the Viksit Bharat—Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) aka VB—G RAM G Bill that replaced the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 (MGNREGA).Even as India debated war, the rupee and air quality, one light but telling constant stayed in pop‑political culture: the obsession with the marital status of the eternal bachelors of India. Salman Khan, about to celebrate his 60th birthday, and Rahul Gandhi, still unmarried and still central to the Congress story, remained prime targets of perennial “shaadi kab karoge?” question.In fact, during the run-up to the Bihar Assembly elections, Rahul occasionally used the topic to lighten the mood at press conferences. While sharing a stage with Tejashwi Yadav, he revealed that Lalu Prasad Yadav had advised him to get married soon.Tejashwi, however, used the same platform to turn the spotlight on another eligible bachelor - his rival Chirag Paswan - publicly urging him to tie the knot.","The year 2025 is drawing to an end and most people are busy figuring out the New Year's resolutions.

Kerala gets its first BJP mayor: Is the 'red fortress' collapsing? What it means for state assembly elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-gets-its-first-bjp-mayor-thiruvananthapuram-is-the-red-fortress-collapsing-what-it-means-for-state-assembly-elections-cpm-udf-vv-rajesh/articleshow/126189956.cms,"What local body polls show?



Will the 'red fortresses' collapse?



NEW DELHI: Kerala got its first BJP mayor, VV Rajesh, after the National Democratic Alliance won Thiruvananthapuram civic body elections, marking an end to 45 years of Left Democratic Front's (LDF) rule in the city.Thiruvananthapuram was treated like ""inherited property under Left–Congress dominance for decades,"" said state BJP general secretary Anoop Antony Joseph.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had already hailed the saffron wave in the red-dominated region as a ""watershed moment"", saying: “Thank you Thiruvananthapuram! The mandate the BJP-NDA got in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation is a watershed moment in Kerala’s politics.”In Kollam corporation, UDF’s AK Hafeez was elected mayor, while Kochi saw four-time councillor VK Minimol assume the mayor’s post. Thrissur also went the UDF’s way with Dr Niji Justin elected mayor, though the result was accompanied by internal dissent after councillor Lali James alleged she was sidelined following bribery by party leaders. In Kannur too, the UDF strengthened its position, with P Indira set to take charge as mayor.One of the standout moments of the results came from Pala municipality, where 21-year-old Diya Binu Pulikkankandam was elected chairperson with UDF backing, becoming the youngest municipal chairperson in Kerala. Diya, along with her father Binu and uncle Biju, won as Independents before extending support to the UDF — a move that ended Kerala Congress (Mani)’s long-standing dominance in Pala, once considered its political citadel.The NDA, meanwhile, posted selective but symbolically significant gains. The BJP retained control of Thiruvananthapuram and also emerged victorious in the municipalities of Tripunithura and Palakkad, underlining its expanding footprint in urban local bodies. While the LDF managed to hold its ground in Kozhikode by winning the majority of wards, it secured only one of the six corporations overall.As the CPI(M) looks ahead to the 2026 Kerala Assembly election, it does so from a position of growing vulnerability. A strong wave of anti-incumbency and governance fatigue has begun to weigh on the Left after a decade in office.These fault lines were evident not just in the local body polls, but also in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The Left struggled badly at the national level even as the Congress regained momentum in the state and the BJP carved out space in what was long considered a near one-party arena. The parliamentary contests exposed a shrinking footprint for the Left beyond state politics.In both the 2019 and 2024 general elections, the CPI(M) won only a handful of Kerala’s 20 Lok Sabha seats, while the Congress-led UDF dominated and the BJP managed to open its account. This contrast has underscored a weakening appeal in national elections, even as the Left retains power in Thiruvananthapuram. That control was reaffirmed in 2021, when the LDF secured a decisive Assembly victory and achieved the rare feat of a second consecutive term in Kerala.

Pizhaiththa Thennandhoppu—The Spared Grove

Rain can create havoc and harm; yet for those

afflicted, rain alone becomes refuge.

I was standing by a glass window, watching the rain . The sound was muted, yet the sight was anything but gentle. Jets of water struck the glass ferociously, as though the sky itself was knocking—urgent, restless. I was reminded that nature often speaks most powerfully even when unheard.As I watched, my thoughts drifted to poets across eras and cultures, separated by time and geography, and to how rain has unfailingly served as a spring of creativity.Keen observation, emotional depth, and mastery over language allow them to distil fleeting moments into enduring truths. Whether ancient or modern, poetry repeatedly returns to the same elemental concerns—love and loss, despair and hope , destruction and renewal.Tamil poetry offers a striking illustration of this convergence. From the Sangam era onward, poets lived in intimate dialogue with their landscape. Nature was never a passive backdrop; it was a symbolic language. Love, separation, anticipation, and sorrow were mapped onto hills, forests, seashores, and rain-laden skies.Kapilar, one of the greatest Sangam poets, exemplifies this sensitivity. In a celebrated verse, he describes a lovelorn heroine stringing a garland of 99 flowers after bathing in a waterfall. Each flower suggests a slightly different shade of love—desire, tenderness, hesitation, ache.On Nov 30, 1916, Subramania Bharati, then living in Puducherry, witnessed a devastating cyclone that ravaged the coast. In its wake, he composed, often described as the ghostly dance of divine rain. For Bharati, rain a cosmic force—fierce and sublime.The day after the storm, he walked along the shore and found dead birds scattered on the beach. It is said that he gathered them using his turban cloth and buried them. Later, he visited a coconut grove owned by a poor friend. While neighbouring farms lay uprooted, this small grove alone had survived. From this experience emerged. Bharati marvels at the rain’s benevolence in protecting the poorest, seeing in it both fury and compassion.Centuries earlier, Andal had offered a different, equally radical vision. In one evocative passage, she watches thunderous rain and imagines it as Krishna himself. The dark raincloud becomes his blue form; lightning is likened to the Sudarshana Chakra; thunder becomes the Panchajanya conch, the sound of cosmic creation. Yet she asks the rain to nourish the world, not to destroy it. Emotion, theology, and ecology merge seamlessly.Thiruvalluvar, earlier still, devoted an entire chapter to rain. One couplet captures its paradox with timeless clarity:Keduppadhoong Kettaarkku Charvaaimatr AangeEdupadhoom Ellaam MazhaiValluvar had already distilled its essence into a few spare lines. Rain may wound and rain may heal, he reminds us, but it is rain alone that sustains life. In that truth lies the shared wisdom of poets across time: what falls from the heavens carries both burden and blessing, and it is in learning to receive it with humility that the world endures.It was perhaps the last rain of this calendar year. The clouds had emptied themselves, the windowpane stood clear again, and the world returned to stillness. Yet rain, like poetry, does not obey calendars. It will return—in another season, another century, another line of verse. Long after dates are forgotten, rain will continue to fall, and poets will continue to listen.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126189865,imgsize-57334,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/126189865.jpg"

Bangladesh Election Turmoil Deepens, Hasina's Awami League Rejects Poll Timeline Under Yunus Re

NAGPUR: Amidst the brutal persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh in the run-up to the February polls, a party registered in April hopes to fight its maiden elections, seeking Hindu and other minority votes.Bangladesh Minority Janta Party (BMJP) is preparing to contest 91 of 300 seats of Jatiya Parishad (national parliament), hoping to win 40 to 45 seats, said the outfit's president, Sukriti Kumar Mandal.Talking to TOI on phone from Dhaka, Mandal said, ""We have zeroed in on constituencies where the minority, especially the Hindu vote-bank, ranges from 20% to 60%.""Scrambling to file nominations before the Monday deadline, Mandal feels Hindus need to feel safe to come out and vote. A tie-up with any mainstream party - be it Tarique Rahman's BNP or Jamaat-e-Islami - can help. ""With an alliance with these parties, minorities can come out of their houses without fearing retaliation. Awami League is off the radar, and BMJP is the only voice of persecuted Hindus,"" Mandal told TOI.Mandal said the party candidates would be finalised in a day or two. ""By Saturday, all nominations would be filed,"" he said.He said India should change its stand on Bangladesh and only back the cause of Hindus, instead of supporting the Awami League.""If India shifts from its pro-Awami League stand, mainstream Bangladesh parties will sit up and take note. India must know that BMJP is the sole voice of minorities,"" Mandal said. A change in stand could also lead to a change in Bangladeshi mindset towards India, he said, adding the Awami League only used India to gain power.The five-point agenda shared with TOI includes working towards a secular Bangladesh, establishing a federal system by carving out five provinces, and establishing fundamental and constitutional rights of each state. BMJP also proposes changes in textbooks with a secular and scientific approach, apart from ensuring fair rights for minorities.","Bangladesh Minority Janta Party (BMJP) is preparing to contest 91 of 300 seats of Jatiya Parishad (national parliament) The outfit's president, Sukriti Kumar Mandal, hopes to win 40 to 45 seats.

"Acting on 'sixth sense', Supreme Court quashes rape conviction",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/acting-on-sixth-sense-supreme-court-quashes-rape-conviction/articleshow/126195906.cms,"Supreme Court

Unnao Rape Convict Kuldeep Sengar's Bail Triggers Protests In Delhi, Victim’s Mother Demands Hanging

NEW DELHI: It is justice by ""sixth sense"". While going through bail petition of a rape convict, Supreme Court got the sense this was a consenting relationship that turned sour and resulted in conviction and a 10-year prison term for the man.It then decided to tread a different path for adjudicating the case. It interacted with the convict and the victim, along with their parents, and the case ended with their marriage and quashing of conviction.As the convict was in jail, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma directed MP police to bring him to SC under police protection. It took the court nine months to decide the case as notice was issued in March on his plea and conviction was quashed in Dec and in between they got married.""This is one of those rare cases where on intervention of this court the appellant herein, who had applied to seek suspension of his sentence, was ultimately benefitted by quashing of his conviction as well as the sentence. ...when the matter came up before this court by assailing the rejection of suspension of sentence by HC, on a consideration of facts of the case, we had a sixth sense that the appellant and the prosecutrix could be brought together..."" the bench said.On direction of the court, both the parties, along with their parents, appeared in court and the judges personally interacted with them in chamber to know about the nature of their relationship. As they expressed willingness to get married which was also approved by their parents, SC granted the man bail to come out of jail for marriage. The two got married in July.Court thereafter posted the case for Dec to take stock of their married life and passed the final order for quashing of conviction after court was informed that they are living happily together.""Consequently, we invoked our powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to do complete justice in the matter by quashing the complaint as well as the conviction and sentence passed against the appellant... owing to a misunderstanding the consensual relationship between the parties was given a criminal colour and converted into an offence of false promise of marriage whereas the parties, in fact, intended to marry each other. It was only owing to the appellant seeking postponement in the date of marriage which may have led to insecurity in the mind of the respondent and filing of the criminal complaint,"" the bench said.In this case, both became friends in 2015 on a social media platform and both developed a liking and fondness for each other. Thereafter, both the parties entered into a consensual physical relationship. As marriage between them could not fructify, she filed an FIR in 2021 under Section 376 and 376(2)(n) of IPC (regarding rape).He was convicted by trial court which sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years. He challenged the order in HC where his appeal is still pending. He moved SC after his bail plea was rejected by HC.SC also directed his job at a govt hospital be restored with back wages. He was suspended after conviction.

Heavy traffic blamed for delay

CHITRADURGA/BENGALURU: The passengers who escaped the bus fire after a collision with a truck near Hiriyur, Karnataka, in the early hours of Thursday said surviving the flames was only the first battle; the second was the long wait in the bitter night cold for medical help.While three passengers in the sleeper coach survived serious wounds including burns, 25 others suffered minor injuries. Most passengers were asleep when the crash jolted them awake. Thick smoke quickly filled the bus, leaving many gasping for breath. With no time to think, several passengers kicked open windows and jumped out of the burning vehicle, sustaining injuries as flames engulfed the bus behind them.Hemaraj, who was travelling with his wife Kalpana and eight-year-old son to Gokarna, said: ""We were in deep sleep. I suddenly felt something falling on my head from above. When I looked around, everything was dark and filled with smoke. I realised a fire had broken out, and I immediately pushed my son out through the window. Then my wife jumped. I looked towards the back of the bus and heard people crying for help and shouting in panic. By then, the fire had reached us. I had no choice but to jump out through the window,"" he said.For many passengers who escaped, panic soon turned into anger.""We were alive, but in pain. We were shivering in the cold, injured, with the bus still burning in front of us.

We helped them escape,"" he said. With ambulances still missing, locals eventually helped shift the injured to Hiriyur and Shira govt hospitals once vehicles arrived.The drivers of the ambulances which reached the accident spot maintained that they got delayed because of a massive traffic jam on the highway. ""With vehicle movements coming to a standstill on the highway after the crash, we took a long time to reach the spot.

Gautam Gambhir's year as India coach ends like it started - on a chaotic note

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who largely keeps a low profile away from the cricket field, made a rare public appearance when he attended Bollywood superstar Salman Khan’s 60th birthday celebrations in Panvel, Maharashtra. Khan marked the milestone with a midnight party at his farmhouse, which was attended by close family members, friends and colleagues from the film industry. Dhoni’s presence at the event quickly became a talking point, underlining his enduring popularity even years after retiring from international cricket.As Dhoni left the venue and settled into his car, fans gathered outside broke into loud chants of “Mahi bhai! Mahi bhai!”, a reminder that his aura remains untouched by time or absence from the international stage.While Dhoni now limits his cricketing appearances to the Indian Premier League, his fan following continues to be unmatched, cutting across generations and sporting loyalties.Dhoni will once again be seen in Chennai Super Kings colours in the IPL 2026 season, having been retained by the franchise he has led with remarkable success over the years. Under his captaincy, CSK have built a reputation for stability, backing experience while seamlessly integrating young talent.Notably, Vijay played eight IPL seasons for CSK, all under Dhoni’s leadership, a testament to the former skipper’s ability to foster long-term player development.The influence of Dhoni is already evident on CSK’s latest recruits. Kartik Sharma, one of the franchise’s newest entrants, admitted he was overwhelmed by the intense bidding war that unfolded for him at the recently concluded IPL auction and said he was “extremely excited” at the prospect of sharing a dressing room with the veteran.Watch the video here Kartik, along with Prashant Veer, became the joint-highest-priced uncapped players in IPL history after CSK paid a staggering Rs 14.20 crore each for the duo, who had entered the auction with a base price of Rs 30 lakh. The investment highlighted CSK’s clear intent to nurture emerging Indian talent alongside established names.Speaking to JioStar, Kartik described the emotional rollercoaster of auction night. “First of all, a special thank you to all my family members and friends. Without their support, I don’t think I would have reached this stage. My entire family is very happy, everyone is celebrating and dancing,” he said. Kartik added that playing with Dhoni was a dream come true, revealing that he broke down in tears as the bids kept climbing.Recognised for his aggressive middle-order batting and reliable wicketkeeping, Kartik has scored 334 runs in 12 T20 matches at a strike rate of 164, hitting 28 sixes and featuring among the top six-hitters in the Ranji Trophy. He has also impressed in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and earned praise after training with CSK last season, particularly for his ability to handle both spin and pace — qualities that could flourish under Dhoni’s guidance.","MS Dhoni made a rare public appearance when he attended Bollywood superstar Salman Khan’s 60th birthday celebrations in Panvel, Maharashtra.

Speaking in public, O'Malley questioned the availability or preparedness of well-known figures including Alex Pereira, Conor McGregor, Jon Jones, and Ilia Topuria.



There is increasing pressure on Dana White to produce a roster befitting of the historic occasion as a result of injuries, personal breaks, and internal hesitations impacting a number of elite competitors.

Sean O’Malley says the UFC White House Card is lacking superstars and the organization needs him! 😳

Sean O’Malley shared that uncertainty grows as star availability comes into question

Sean O’Malley is a mixed martial artist from the United States who competes in the Ultimate Fighting Championship's (UFC) bantamweight division. He became one of the promotion's most marketable figures and a former UFC bantamweight champion after becoming well-known for his flamboyant style, knockout power, and highlight-reel finishes. Dana White, CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), said that the White House UFC show is already having problems that it was supposed to face. As the event's rumors grew, so did the worries associated with it about whether there would be enough big-name acts to lead the historic show. Former UFC bantamweight champion Sean O'Malley has now added to those worries after talking about the matter in public.

He mentioned in the conversation that Conor McGregor may not be ready to compete by the proposed date. Not just this, O'Malley even raised a question whether Jon Jones would be able to make an appearance.Sean O’Malley even highlighted that Ilia Topuria has left for personal reasons and won't be back until early 2026. O'Malley has raised doubts about another important player, Alex Pereira, who might not be available. This has created a lot of buzz amongst the fans.Additional complications arose when more popular names on the card, including Sean Strickland and Khamzat Chimaev, were discussed by Sean O’Malley. Islam Makhachev has reportedly shown interest in competing on the White House card, though there are rumors that his mentor, Khabib Nurmagomedov, does not fully support the idea. Heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall's recent eye injury has raised concerns about his future availability, stated O'Malley.Dana White and the UFC are under pressure as the announcement date comes closer to the uncertainty around fighters' availability. There are still possibilities, but the increasing number of unresolved issues and unavailability raises concerns about whether the White House card can live up to the historic expectations.

Alexa Bliss’ WWE success and evolving career earnings

Ryan Cabrera’s music career, royalties, and lifestyle choices

Alexa Bliss and Ryan Cabrera’s combined net worth in 2025 is estimated at around $6 million, reflecting two very different entertainment careers that intersect through marriage. It's one from the worldwide circus tent of pro wrestling, where a star's name value and staying power have always counted every bit as much, if not more than, wins and titles. One stems from the early-2000s pop-rock explosion when radio singles and CD sales could shape a career for decades. Combined, they give us a glimpse of what modern celebrity means in terms of money: less of one dominant moment and more of all the outlets contributing to success, the many streams and tributaries flowing into one range.Neither of them is one of the top 10 richest names in their industries, but their combined earnings reflect steadiness, brand, and the long-term dividend of remaining relevant. Their 2025 net worth includes WWE contracts, music royalties, occasional appearances, and a lifestyle that is comfortable but not flashy.Alexa Bliss has been one of the biggest women's stars for WWE over the last 10 years. A former several-time Raw and SmackDown Women’s Champion, her earnings have been primarily based on WWE base contracts, pay-per-view bonuses, merchandise royalties, and premium live event appearances.Her return to the active roster in 2025 elevated her earning capacity, since special presentation talent generally receives a much greater appearance fee and merch showcasing.Outside of the ring, Bliss makes plenty of money off sponsorships, media appearances, and a huge social media presence that opens up partnerships with brands. These extra income sources keep her finances stable, especially during times when she isn't in the ring full-time. Her personal fortune is estimated at between $3 million and $4 million, so she is the financial heavyweight of the couple.The early 2000s hitmaker had chart-topping singles and a certified-platinum debut album. Despite the loss of his mainstream radio presence, however, his catalogue lives on, earning money through streaming, licensing, and royalties. These long-term revenues often underpin the earnings of artists from that era.Cabrera also works as a catalyst; his income comes from occasional live performances, television appearances, and music-related projects. His estimated net worth in 2025 stands at roughly $2 million. Together with Alexa Bliss, their combined net worth of about $6 million reflects diversified income rather than explosive growth.Also Read: John Cena retired: List of all celebrities and WWE superstars who paid tribute to the GOAT","Alexa Bliss and Ryan Cabrera’s combined net worth in 2025 is estimated at around $6 million.

Seattle’s toughest stretch reshaped the conversation around the team

For much of the 2025 NFL season, the Seattle Seahawks have lived outside the national spotlight. While fans and analysts spent weeks arguing over the Super Bowl credentials of the New England Patriots and Denver Broncos, Seattle kept stacking important wins. They have now earned the respect of none other than Tom Brady.Brady expressed his surprise at the team’s rise and performance, admitting that he is now a big fan. With an 18-16 win over the Colts and an incredible triumph of 38-37 against the Rams, the Seahawks are becoming the team that everyone is turning to as they continue to deliver consistent performances.The Seahawks’ early success was often brushed aside as predictable by critics and detractors, who insisted that the real test would come when faced with the elite teams. That moment arrived with the big wins against the Colts and the Rams. Head coach Mike Macdonald has emphasized trust and teamwork for the season as he addressed the media recently.He said, “It's who we are. It's what we do. You believe in who you are, and then you keep doing it and keep proving it, really to yourself and to our guys.” After the Rams win, Macdonald reinforced that mindset, stating, “They understand who they are, and when it's time to put it on the line, they're ready to go.”The rise of the Seahawks surprised many, even veteran Tom Brady, who was initially skeptical. As a FOX Sports analyst, Brady had previously kept Seattle just outside the top spot in his power rankings. They sat at No. 4 in week 14. This week, he has placed the team at No. 1, as stated, “I can admit I was a little slow to come around on this team.”He further added, “But they've proven their worth. The only question surrounding this team might be those uniforms. Are you feeling the Oregon vibes?” With two games left against the Panthers and 49ers, the Seahawks now shift from proving their worth to maintaining their consistency.Also read: Will Charles Cross play against the Los Angeles Rams tonight?

How the Celtics vs Pacers game may play out

, 2025, when the Boston Celtics visit the Indiana Pacers at Gainbridge Fieldhouse. He remains out as he continues to recover from right Achilles repair surgery and was officially listed as unavailable on the NBA injury report.This game was already shaping up to be uneven because of injuries on both sides. With Jayson Tatum still sidelined, Boston again enters without its top scorer and main offensive option. Indiana is dealing with similar problems, leaving both teams short-handed heading into a late-December matchup.Jayson Tatum injured his right Achilles during last season’s playoffs and had surgery on May 13, 2025. The original recovery timeline was eight to nine months, and there has been no indication that he is close to returning. There were no late updates or signs of a surprise appearance for this game.Without him, Boston leans on Jaylen Brown, Derrick White, and Payton Pritchard to carry most of the workload. The Celtics have managed stretches without Tatum before, but the offense is simpler and more predictable when he is not on the floor.Boston Celtics’ roster is further limited by several additional absences.Jordan Walsh is listed as probable and could play, but Boston’s main rotation remains thin.Indiana’s injury list is just as long, with several regular contributors unavailable.With Haliburton out, Indiana relies more on Pascal Siakam and Andrew Nembhard, but the team plays at a slower pace without its lead guard.Boston Celtics recently beat Indiana Pacers 103-95 while dealing with similar injuries, and this matchup looks like another low-scoring game shaped by depth and execution. Brown is expected to take on a larger scoring role, while Indiana looks to stay competitive through half-court offense.Also read: Boston Celtics vs Indiana Pacers regular season game: Full injury report, who's out, where to watch, and more (December 26, 2025) Tip-off is scheduled for 7:00 PM ET on NBA TV and local broadcasts.

Joel Embiid listed as doubtful as Philadelphia 76ers manage key injuries ahead of Bulls clash

Injury update ahead of Bulls game: Joel Embiid remains doubtful, while several Sixers are battling illness

After the Christmas break, the Philadelphia 76ers will play five games on the road starting on Friday against the Chicago Bulls. After losing to the Brooklyn Nets at home on Tuesday, the Sixers will be trying to climb back into the win column. According to the most recent injury report, Joel Embiid is expected to play if there are no problems during pregame warm-ups.Careful management has shaped Joel Embiid's 2025–26 campaign. Due to problems with both knees, he missed time earlier and has hardly ever played on consecutive nights. Last season, Embiid struggled with a knee issue that eventually necessitated in-season surgery. In less than a year, he underwent his second knee surgery. Due to injury, he missed the first two years of his NBA career and didn't play for the 76ers until the 2016–17 campaign.With the players' injuries largely resolved, the Philadelphia 76ers are getting ready for their regular-season game against the Chicago Bulls on December 26, 2025. According to the injury report, the Sixers will be without Trendon Watford (left adductor strain) and Kelly Oubre Jr. (left knee sprain).In an effort to get back on the floor, both players are still working through their customised exercises.Joel Embiid is doubtful against the Bulls due to his right knee ailment. He had a scare in the third quarter when he momentarily departed after grabbing at the knee, but he was still able to play against the Nets.His listing is related to regular knee care rather than a recent injury. That distinction is important. The Sixers have been transparent about Embiid's absences throughout the season. The squad did not hesitate to rule him out when his knees flared up earlier. The team feels he is healthy enough to be on the floor this time.When the 76ers lost to the Brooklyn Nets in their most recent game, Embiid was back in the starting lineup. In just over 31 minutes, he concluded that game with 27 points, six rebounds, four assists, and two blocked shots. He had missed two straight games before that one. Due to an injury scare, Embiid briefly left the Nets game.Embiid has only made 12 appearances overall for the 76ers this season. With splits of 43.5 percent from the field, 24.1 percent from the 3-point line, and 82 percent from the free-throw line, he has been averaging 21.0 points, 6.6 rebounds, 2.9 assists, and 1.3 blocked shots.Even though former MVP Joel Embiid has missed a lot of time this season, Tyrese Maxey and the Philadelphia 76ers have been among the NBA's more unexpected teams. The Chicago Bulls, who are 14-15 this season and on the periphery of the East play-in picture, will be the Sixers' slight road favourites on Friday.Due to illness, Dominick Barlow, Quentin Grimes, and VJ Edgecombe are all classified as questionable. They were all absent from the Nets' defeat on Tuesday. After winning four straight games, Chicago is now ranked No. 10 in the East, although it is still ranked 23rd in the league in net rating and 28th in opponent points per game.The Sixers, on the other hand, have recently made significant progress on defence, rising to the 11th spot in the league in defensive rating. On Friday, the Sixers and Bulls will tip off at the United Centre at 7:30 p.m. EST.Also read: NBA injury update: Will Luka Doncic suit up for Christmas Day as Los Angeles Lakers await big decision vs Houston Rockets?","Joel Embiid listed as doubtful as Philadelphia 76ers manage key injuries ahead of Bulls clash.

Frank Warren fuels talk of a blockbuster Tyson Fury fight



Tyson Fury’s comeback plans have taken a new turn after his promoter hinted at a huge fight announcement. Just weeks after confirming he plans to return to the ring, Fury is once again at the center of boxing speculation. The former two-time heavyweight champion had announced another retirement in January. That decision came shortly after his second straight loss to Oleksandr Usyk. Many believed that the chapter was closed for good.However, Fury has continued to tease fans with mixed signals over the past few months. Earlier this month, the 37-year-old made it clear that he sees unfinished business in boxing. His words suggested a renewed hunger and a desire to reclaim his place at the top.Tyson Fury recently broke his silence with an emotional message about returning to the ring. He said the journey back would be difficult and lonely but hinted that greatness and legacy awaited him at the end. His statement was widely seen as confirmation that another comeback is coming soon.Soon after, Frank Warren stirred excitement among fans. The Queensberry Promotions boss shared that a huge fight deal has already been agreed.He said an announcement would be made in the coming days or weeks and described the matchup as something special. His message instantly sparked debate across the boxing world.Many British fans are hoping the news involves a long-awaited clash between Fury and Anthony Joshua. Joshua recently added to the drama after his dominant win over Jake Paul in Miami. Speaking after the fight, AJ said he was ready for bigger challenges in 2026. He openly questioned Fury’s seriousness and challenged him to stop talking online and settle things in the ring. Joshua made it clear that if Fury truly believes he is the best, then a fight between them should finally happen.Despite the excitement, Warren poured some cold water on immediate plans. In an interview with The Sun, he explained that Fury fighting as early as February would be unrealistic. He noted that Joshua is expected to fight around that time, which complicates scheduling. Warren also said that if the fight happens at Wembley Stadium or in Riyadh, timing becomes even more difficult. Wembley, in particular, would likely mean waiting until summer.He added that Fury would not want to stay inactive for several more months after already being out of the ring for nearly a year. One thing Warren made very clear was that Fury’s return will not involve facing a YouTuber.For now, fans must wait. But with both Fury and Joshua speaking openly, the biggest fight in British boxing may finally be edging closer to reality.Also Read: Frank Warren names perfect time in place for Tyson Fury vs Anthony Joshua showdown",Frank Warren fuels talk of a blockbuster Tyson Fury fight with a huge announcement.

Steelers maintain silence amid growing scrutiny

Also Read:

Veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers has addressed the controversy surrounding DK Metcalf, as questions continue to mount following the Steelers star’s sideline altercation with a fan during Week 16 action.Metcalf was suspended for two games by the NFL after video surfaced showing him shoving a fan seated near the field during Pittsburgh’s win over the Detroit Lions. While Metcalf’s associates have alleged the fan used an offensive slur, the individual has publicly denied the accusation. After reviewing available evidence, the league chose to uphold the suspension, signaling that no mitigating circumstances were found.Rodgers, who had a close view of the incident from the field, offered measured remarks when asked about the situation. While stopping short of defending Metcalf’s actions, the veteran quarterback emphasized that player-fan interactions have grown increasingly volatile.“I don’t condone what happened,” Rodgers said. “But I think there’s a mindset that you buy a ticket and can say whatever you want. There should be some kind of code of conduct.”Rodgers also noted that players are subjected to more personal and aggressive remarks than ever before, particularly in high-stakes environments. He stressed that while accountability matters, context should not be ignored.Although the league discipline appears settled, the matter may not be over. According to Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio, the fan involved is planning a press conference, a development that has fueled speculation about possible civil action.If legal proceedings follow, analysts warn that public statements made by players or team personnel could become relevant. While no lawsuit has been filed at this stage, the NFL’s decision to uphold Metcalf’s suspension may carry weight if the issue moves beyond league governance.The Pittsburgh Steelers haven't said much in public, which is in line with head coach Mike Tomlin's long-standing propensity for dealing with delicate issues behind closed doors. Since Metcalf won't be able to play for the rest of the regular season, it seems like the organization's major goal right now is to keep things stable throughout this important stretch of games.Rodgers' calm and thoughtful words show how hard it is for players to talk about difficult events, especially those that could lead to legal problems.For now, Metcalf will serve his suspension, but we don't know what will happen next. What happens off the field in the near future may be just as important as what happens on the field when it comes to whether the incident goes away or gets worse.The NFL is still trying to figure out how to deal with changing fan behavior and player safety, both physical and personal. The Metcalf case is a reminder that things that happen near the edge of the field can quickly become problems that go beyond the game itself.",Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers says he doesn't condone DK Metcalf's actions. Rodgers says there should be a code of conduct for player-fan interactions.

Kendall Wesenberg looks forward to a tough comeback and final push for the 2026 Winter Olympics



Chasing an Olympic dream is difficult at any age. Doing it at 35, after a serious spinal injury, is even harder. Kendall Lorraine Wesenberg is proving it can still be done. The American skeleton racer, who competed at the 2018 Winter Olympics, spent nearly 600 days recovering from a major back problem. Many believed her career was over. Instead, she returned to competition and is now pushing for a spot at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan.Wesenberg recently spoke honestly about her long recovery journey. She shared how every step forward brought a tougher challenge. Making the World Cup team again was a major milestone. With Olympic qualification approaching, her focus is clear and unwavering.Kendall Wesenberg reflected on her recovery journey in a recent Instagram post.“Each time I’ve reached a milestone in this recovery, the next goal that follows has been an even more difficult one. And when I made our World Cup team in November, I was well aware that racing on the top tour would be the biggest challenge yet”, she wrote.Her return showed promise early. At the Fall Selection Races at Utah Olympic Park, she finished second overall in women’s skeleton. The following day, on November 1, she won the race with the fastest two-run combined time of 1:39.49.The result earned her a place on the 2025-26 World Cup circuit.However, the World Cup season brought new struggles. At Cortina d’Ampezzo, Wesenberg placed 23rd. In Lillehammer, she finished 27th individually, though Team USA won silver in the mixed team event. Looking back, she admitted the start was harder than expected.“Some errors on my part, some unlucky draws, and my push not being back in the way I hoped it would be have led to missing more cuts in half of a season than in the rest of my career combined. This has put me in a tough spot in terms of qualifying, but it’s not over until it’s over”, she added.Despite the setbacks, USA Bobsled & Skeleton named her to the official World Cup roster on November 1, 2025. Wesenberg now looks ahead to tracks she knows well. Winterberg, St. Moritz, and Altenberg are next on her schedule. She wrote, “My three best tracks on circuit this year are up next, and I plan on giving it everything I have in the final World Cup races of the season.”Team USA will announce its Olympic skeleton team on January 17.

How LaMelo Ball’s Availability Changes the Game

for the Charlotte Hornets’ game against the Orlando Magic on December 26, 2025. He has not been ruled in or out, leaving Charlotte without a firm answer as game time approaches.The Hornets have dealt with injuries all season, and Ball’s situation fits that pattern. He has played through ankle and wrist problems for months. While his name continues to appear on injury watchlists, the team has not given a final update. Anyone waiting to see him play will need to check the official report closer to tip-off.LaMelo Ball remains listed as uncertain. No new injury has been specified for this matchup, but his recent history includes left ankle soreness and wrist issues that have affected his availability throughout the season.Charlotte Hornets’ injury concerns extend beyond LaMelo Ball. Ryan Kalkbrenner is out with a left elbow sprain. Mason Plumlee will miss the game with a right groin strain. Grant Williams remains sidelined after right knee surgery. With several rotation players unavailable, Charlotte’s margin for error is thin.Orlando Magic also enters the game short-handed. Franz Wagner is out due to a left high ankle sprain, removing one of the Magic’s main scoring options.Jalen Suggs is listed as doubtful with a left hip contusion. Goga Bitadze is questionable because of a left knee strain.Even with those absences, Orlando has played well at home. The Magic are 10-4 at the Kia Center this season and have relied on defense and depth to stay steady when starters are missing.When LaMelo Ball plays, Charlotte’s offense looks different. In recent games when healthy, he has been around 23 points and nine assists per night, while also stretching the floor with his shooting. Without him, the Hornets have struggled to generate consistent offense.If Ball does not play, more responsibility will fall on Miles Bridges, who leads the team at 20.6 points per game.

Quinton Rampage Jackson gifts son Elijah Jackson a rare Audi R8 after keeping childhood promise

Quinton Rampage Jackson made Christmas very special this year. The former UFC light heavyweight champion surprised his youngest son with a gift many people only dream about. Just days before Christmas, Jackson shared that he spent about $275,000 on a car for his son, Elijah “Rampage” Jackson. This was not a last-minute idea. Jackson said it was a promise he made when his son was very young. Years later, he finally kept that promise.The moment quickly went viral after Jackson posted it on X. Fans saw a proud father and a shocked son sharing a quiet but powerful moment together. The gift stood out not just because of the price, but because of the meaning behind it. Jackson did not buy something for himself. He chose to reward his son and celebrate family during the holidays. That message made the story travel fast across social media.Jackson revealed the surprise on X, where he posted a video from his garage. In the clip, Elijah Jackson walks in and sees a black Audi R8 waiting for him. He pauses, clearly stunned, and asks if the car is really his.Jackson replies with a calm smile and says, “Like I promised you when you were a kid.” He then reminds his son to drive carefully, warning him that the car is very fast.After that, he hands over the keys.The Audi R8 is one of the brand’s top sports cars. It comes with a V10 engine and a carbon-fiber body. According to Edmunds, newer Audi R8 models can cost up to $275,000, depending on features. Older versions can be cheaper, but Jackson did not share the exact model.Audi officially ended R8 production in March 2024, as confirmed by Audi. That has made existing models more valuable among car lovers.Jackson shares Elijah with his former wife, Yuki Imoto. He is also a father to other children, including daughter Naname Nakia Jackson. Still, this moment was fully about a father and son.Later, Jackson also spoke about his income today. During a livestream, he said streaming has paid him more than fighting ever did. “I have been streaming for eight months, and I made more than I did in my fighting career,” he said. He added that sponsors support him more now because more people watch his streams.Quinton Rampage Jackson streams travel videos, home life clips, and content with other creators. He also shared that having two kids in college pushed him to focus on streaming full-time. The success of that move made this Christmas promise possible.Also Read: Ex-UFC Champion Sean O’Malley Flags Trouble For Dana White As The White House Card Faces Major Concern","Quinton Rampage Jackson surprised his son with a rare Audi R8 for Christmas.

Candace Owens, Charlie Kirk, Erika Kirk, and George Farmer: what TikTok claims and what dates show

Alex Jones’ RARE Warning Over Candace Owens’ ‘WILD’ Charlie Kirk Theory | ‘DANGEROUS & Troubling’





A viral TikTok has pushed an old rumor back into the spotlight. The video claims Candace Owens once had strong feelings for Charlie Kirk , and that she stayed bitter after he married another woman. The post spread fast and pulled in thousands of comments. Some users say the story explains years of tension. Others say the timeline does not match the facts.According to the ibtimes , TikTok says Owens was “100% falling over to this dude” before Kirk met his future wife. It adds that Kirk seemed interested too, and that Owens pictured a future with him. When Kirk later married Erika Kirk, the creator says Owens felt she lost “the one that got away.” The claim also suggests Owens rushed into her own marriage after Kirk’s engagement. That last part is where many viewers stopped and checked dates.The TikTok, shared by creator The Older Millennial, goes further. It says Owens accepted a proposal over FaceTime just 18 days after meeting her husband, and that this was a reaction to Kirk’s engagement. The creator ends by saying Owens’ anger toward Erika comes from believing she “stole her man.”Comments split right away. Many users agreed with the tone of jealousy. One wrote, “Her behaviour is the epitome of a woman scorned.” Another added, “She’s giving bitter ex girlfriend and if my spouse was talking about a friend like that I would be super suspicious.” Others piled on with short takes like, “All her drama is jealousy,” “She just low-key jealous,” and “Massive jealousy.”But several viewers pushed back with dates. One comment said, “She met her husband before he met Erika. So that time line doesn’t work.” Another added, “She married two years before Charlie got married to Erika.”Public timelines back this up. Owens married George Farmer in 2019. Charlie Kirk married Erika in 2021. That means Candace Owens was already married well before Charlie Kirk’s wedding. Because of this, the claim that Owens rushed her marriage due to Kirk’s engagement does not hold up.As the debate grew, some comments went far beyond romance. A few users made extreme claims, with one writing, “The more she talks the more I’m convinced she was involved.” Others quickly called that a “holy reach” and said it had no proof at all.The story shows how fast online talk can grow. A short TikTok video about her old feelings turned into claims about jealousy, and wild accusations. The dates are clear, but the gossip keeps moving.Also Read: Candace Owens Faces Pushback As Alex Jones Questions Her Charlie Kirk Claims After Laura Loomer Talks","A viral TikTok has pushed an old rumor back into the spotlight.

Gautam Gambhir's year as India coach ends like it started - on a chaotic note

As the year drew to a close, Indian cricket found itself sharing space with an unfamiliar kind of headline. Vaibhav Sooryavanshi, still three months short of his 15th birthday, was named a recipient of the Prime Minister’s National Award for Children, the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar. It is the country’s highest civilian honour for achievers between the ages of five and 18. No cricketer had ever received it before. That alone set him apart. The fact that he now sits alongside names like chess stars R Praggnanandhaa and R Vaishali only underlined how extraordinary his rise has been.The award felt like a natural conclusion to a year in which Sooryavanshi did far more than chase records. He rewrote expectations of age, time and readiness. In 2025, no Indian cricketer was searched more on Google. Not Virat Kohli. Not Rohit Sharma. Instead, it was a schoolboy left-hander from Motihari, Bihar, whose name kept reappearing on screens across the country. What began as curiosity soon turned into understanding. This was not noise built on novelty. It was attention driven by performance.The defining moment arrived quietly, without television cameras or primetime build-up.In a Vijay Hazare Trophy match against Arunachal Pradesh, Sooryavanshi produced an innings that seemed to belong to another era. He smashed 190 off just 84 balls, striking at 226.19, with 16 fours and 15 sixes. That knock made him the youngest player in the history of List A cricket to score a century, breaking a 39-year-old world record previously held by Pakistan’s Zahoor Elahi.Yet this was no sudden eruption. Months earlier, on April 28 in Jaipur, Sooryavanshi had announced himself on the IPL stage with startling clarity. At 14 years and 32 days, he scored a breathtaking 101 off 38 balls against Gujarat Titans. It was fearless, explosive and unapologetic. Seven fours, eleven sixes, and a tally of maximums that equalled Murali Vijay’s IPL record. At 14, he also became the youngest player ever to score a T20 century.Even his final appearance of the IPL season felt scripted. Against Chennai Super Kings, he struck 57 off 33 balls to seal a Rajasthan victory. Broadcasters framed it as “Gen Bold vs Gen Gold”. By then, the identity of the poster boy was already clear.Records trailed him everywhere. He made his Ranji Trophy debut at 12 years and 284 days, becoming India’s youngest first-class cricketer. At just 13, he earned an IPL contract worth Rs 1.1 crore, the youngest player ever to be bought at an auction.His impact stretched beyond domestic cricket. Against Australia Under-19, he blasted 104 off 58 balls, the fastest Under-19 century by an Indian and the second-fastest worldwide. Across consecutive Under-19 Asia Cups, he remained central to India’s batting narrative. In 2025, he went even further, hammering an audacious 144 off 42 balls against UAE, an innings that included a 32-ball hundred.Indian cricket has known prodigies before. Very few, however, have shaped an entire year around themselves before finishing school. Vaibhav Sooryavanshi did exactly that.","Vaibhav Sooryavanshi was named a recipient of the Prime Minister’s National Award for Children, the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar.

Gautam Gambhir's year as India coach ends like it started - on a chaotic note

On this day in 2020, December 27, Ajinkya Rahane played an innings that quietly altered the course of Indian Test cricket. It did not come wrapped in noise or bravado. It arrived in the aftermath of trauma. India had been bundled out for their lowest-ever total in the previous match - a humiliating 36 all out in Adelaide. Captain Virat Kohli had flown home on paternity leave. Mohammed Shami was ruled out of the tour. Umesh Yadav was injured. Confidence was fractured, belief questioned, and Australia sensed blood. What followed at the Melbourne Cricket Ground was not merely a response but a reclaiming of dignity, led by a stand-in captain who spoke with his bat.India began the second Test carrying the weight of collapse and expectation. When Day 2 started, they were 36 for 1 after Australia had been bowled out for 195, the echoes of Adelaide still loud. The morning was overcast, the ball moved, and Australia’s fast bowlers bowled disciplined lines.Australia struck early. Shubman Gill and Cheteshwar Pujara fell in quick succession, briefly threatening another collapse.Yet Rahane stood firm. From the very first delivery he faced, there was clarity in his intent. He drove straight when the ball was full, pulled with control when it was short, and trusted his defence when Australia searched for errors. A dropped catch on 78 off the second new ball proved decisive. Rahane marched on, making Australia pay for every missed chance.He stitched the innings together patiently. Partnerships with Hanuma Vihari, Rishabh Pant, and eventually Ravindra Jadeja rebuilt India’s hold on the match. Vihari and Pant showed promise before falling, but Jadeja became the perfect partner. Jadeja left well, chose his scoring areas carefully, and allowed Rahane to dictate the tempo. Their century stand for the sixth wicket broke Australia’s resistance. The bowlers tired, the new ball lost its threat, and frustration crept in. Even when Starc struck Rahane on the handle late in the day, fortune stayed with him as another chance was spilled. By stumps, India had surged to 277 for 5 and momentum had firmly shifted. Rahane’s century was not just technically sound; it was emotionally stabilising. It gave India belief when very little existed.Rahane’s stay ended on 112 off 223 balls the following morning, in unfortunate fashion — run out after a mix-up following Jadeja’s call. There was no visible frustration or anger. Instead, Rahane walked back and gently patted Jadeja on the shoulder, a quiet acknowledgement that such moments are part of the game. Only a week earlier in Adelaide, Rahane himself had been involved in Virat Kohli’s unfortunate run-out, a moment that triggered India’s dramatic collapse in the first innings. Perspective came easily to him. India eventually added a few more runs to be bowled out for 326, but by then the damage to Australia had already been done.Australia’s second innings only deepened the shift. India strangled their scoring, conceding almost nothing. Australia were bowled out for 200 in 103.1 overs, their slowest home Test innings in decades. They did not manage a single half-century. R Ashwin closed it out, Jasprit Bumrah provided the hostility, and Mohammed Siraj continued his remarkable rise. India were left chasing just 70.There were flickers of tension. Mayank Agarwal fell early. Pujara followed. Memories of 36 briefly hovered. But this was not the India from Adelaide. Shubman Gill batted with freedom, and fittingly, it was Rahane who struck the winning runs. India went from humiliation to dominance in the space of a week.That hundred at Melbourne did more than win a Test. It reset the tour. It restored belief. It laid the foundation for what would become one of India’s greatest Test series victories. Quietly, without theatre, Ajinkya Rahane played one of the most important innings in Indian cricket history.Rahane will forever remain an enigma in Indian cricket. Over the years, he played several outstanding overseas innings, often in some of the most difficult conditions imaginable. He remains one of the rare Indian batters whose Test average away from home is better than his record in India, a statistic that speaks volumes about his technique and temperament. Remarkably, India have never lost a Test match when Rahane scored a century, and under his captaincy, the team remains unbeaten in Test cricket.At the same time, his overall numbers never quite reflected the full extent of his ability. An average of 38.46 does not truly capture the quality of a batter who delivered when conditions were hostile and margins were fine. Rahane’s last few home series were particularly challenging, played on surfaces where batting was extremely difficult and excessive turn made run-scoring a constant struggle. These conditions did not affect him alone. The averages of Cheteshwar Pujara, Rahane, and Virat Kohli all took a hit during this phase, largely because India played on wickets where survival itself was an achievement.Rahane played his final Test in 2023 against the West Indies. He had earned a recall for the World Test Championship final earlier that year and responded by finishing as India’s highest run-scorer in the match, with scores of 89 and 46 in the two innings. That performance briefly suggested a late-career revival.However, the subsequent tour of the West Indies proved disappointing. India played two Tests, but the runs did not come. Soon after, he was dropped from the Test side. Since then, Rahane has remained out of the national team, and it appears highly unlikely that he will represent India in Test cricket again.His career, much like his personality, defied easy definition. Understated, resilient, and often underappreciated, Rahane leaves behind a legacy that stats alone cannot fully explain.",Ajinkya Rahane scored an innings that quietly altered the course of Indian Test cricket.

Gautam Gambhir's year as India coach ends like it started - on a chaotic note

INDIAN CRICKET CRICKET IN 2025

Champions Trophy (ODIs, Dubai; Feb–Mar):

T20 Asia Cup (UAE; Sept):

Tests in England (Jun Aug):

Dressing-room unrest:

T20I dips:

No handshakes:

Test dips:

Chinnaswamy stampede:

What an odd, bewildering year this has been for the Indian men’s cricket team. While the women largely dominated the happy headlines and crafted a legacy-shaping, narrative-defining first World Cup win, we watched the men play in split screen mode in 2025.Between Champions Trophy glory and the brisk, bittersweet red-ball goodbyes from Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma came the rise of the new order, embodied by Shubman Gill’s fine run in England. And yet, running through it all was the constant hand-wringing and incessant tweaking of personnel by a team management which has often, from the outside, seemed mired in doubt.The defining feature of Indian cricket’s 2025 campaign was the overshadowing of some fine wins by the self-sabotaging of a proud home Test record.It was almost as if there were two Team Indias. One was the usually assured, monopolistic winning machine that is the white-ball setup, which will face its big test in the T20 World Cup early next year. The other was a confused jumble of a Test team which was undone by misplaced strategy: the quest to manufacture advantage on doctored, spinning pitches on home soil, a throwback-era move for which the largely inexperienced batters were completely ill-prepared.If there was a silver lining, it was that most of Indian cricket’s lows seemed avoidable to everyone but those involved in the decision making. If there was a warning bell, it was that the dismantling of a top Test side can take so little time. The scale of the two defeats to South Africa, in Kolkata and Guwahati, was staggering. Of course, India bounced back in style in the white-ball leg.The pitch, then, rose to become symbolic of India’s 2025 Test campaign. Queer it, and the team came undone. Play it straight, like on the batting-conducive surfaces in England, and the team thrived. It was an early promise of better times which unfortunately petered out by the end of the year. The England tour, where Gill rose to become the kind of match-shaping colossus he is expected to be, was eventually an aberration. The quiet home Test series win of the year, against the West Indies — Gill’s first as Test captain — too did not stick.The 12-year period during which India won every home Test series and built a fierce reputation is now a distant memory. In just over 12 months, the team has lost two out of three home series: a 0-3 loss to New Zealand, followed by the 0-2 drubbing against the well-prepared South Africans. The downslide started, as it turns out, with the appointment of Gautam Gambhir as head coach in July 2024.The Test defeats had a ripple effect — some much-needed intro spection — and an important course-correction followed in an other format. Gill, the anointed one, was dropped from the T20I side for poor form two months ahead of the World Cup. It was a late acknowledgment that in sport, as in life, narratives aren’t always constructed. Poster boys cannot always be manufactured on the field of play.Long-term sporting success is as much organic as strategic. The team management must adjust plans accordingly. Sides that seek to consistently dominate need an element of magic: a rare, ethereal quality that stems from talent and thrives on encouragement. Constant boardroom tinkering and incessant backroom analysis can often undermine this quality. Add to that the punishing cross-format scheduling and one wonders how Gill — who had a long run without a T20I fifty and seemed prone to injury — would have kept up with it all.There may be pressure from all sides to replace Kohli and Rohit’s aura with a new face, someone who can straddle easily across formats and make things easy for both the leadership group and the broadcasters. For now, though, Gill, the ODI and Test captain, will have to bide his time even as World Cup glory beckons the others in the T20 side.The rollback could be an important lesson for the men at the centre of all the attention: Gambhir and selection committee chief Ajit Agarkar. Both are proponents of flexibility and horses-for-courses strategies. Yet they have come across as surprisingly intractable — until the Gill move — when it comes to pushing their vision through.It is now clear that Gambhir, who is more of a public face than Agarkar, was brought in with the clear task of replacing under performing seniors and reshaping the side in his own image. He is yet to command the kind of public respect that his predecessors Ravi Shastri and Rahul Dravid did, and there could be a reason for that. Indians still tend to view the ideal coach as a stern, disciplinarian father figure, especially when it comes to shepherding a young team. As previous such misadventures have shown, with Greg Chappell here and Justin Langer in Australia, the move doesn’t always work out at the international level and only spurs chaos.As commitments end with the likes of Kohli and Rohit hammering inconsequential tons against hopelessly weaker sides in domestic List A games, it almost seems as if Indian cricket is back in the late 1990s. Whispers, innuendo, speculation and perceived agendas have again become talking points. Method and manipulation seem to go hand in hand.The T20 World Cup in the coming year could, however, showcase Gambhir at his strategic best in a format he is clearly more comfortable with. The team also has Abhishek Sharma, who had a standout year. For now, the Test side, having sunk to sixth in the World Test Championship table, can take a backseat. Gambhir and India will be hoping there will be good T20 times to come.HIGHSWon title with a 5–0 record after the 3–1 Test loss in Australia, that too without Bumrah.

BGT lost 1-3. England series drawn 2-2; WI beaten 2-0. South Africa won first series in India in 25 years. India lost in Kolkata by 30 runs (India 93 chasing 124); in Guwahati by 408.

BCCI criticised organisers and RCB executives were arrested. The Chinnaswamy was banned.","The defining feature of Indian cricket’s 2025 campaign was the overshadowing of some fine wins by the self-sabotaging of a proud home Test record. It was almost as if there were two Team Indias. One was the usually assured, monopolistic winning machine that is the white-ball setup, which will face its big test in the T20 World Cup early next year. The other was a confused jumble of a Test team undone by misplaced strategy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126199127,imgsize-77094,width-400,resizemode-4/team-india-champions-trophy.jpg"

Gautam Gambhir's year as India coach ends like it started - on a chaotic note

(With inputs from AFP)

NEW DELHI: A total of 20 wickets tumbled on the opening day of the fourth Test between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Friday, with Australia bowled out for 152 before dismissing England for just 110.The dramatic collapse on both sides sparked concern within Cricket Australia, with chief executive Todd Greenberg warning that shortened Tests were bad for business, even as several of the biggest names in the game criticised the condition of the MCG pitch.It was the highest number of wickets to fall on the first day of an Ashes Test since 1909, following the 19 wickets that fell on day one of the series opener in Perth.That match ended inside two days, costing Cricket Australia millions of dollars in lost revenue, and the Melbourne Test is also shaping up as a potential financial blow for the governing body.""I didn't sleep well last night, put it that way,"" Greenberg said on SEN radio after more than 94,000 packed into the MCG for Friday's first day.""It was an amazing day of Test cricket, so for that record number of people who were here, boy, they've had an experience.""But our challenge is to make sure we can continue those experiences day after day. That's the challenge for all of us.""The Melbourne pitch was prepared with 10 millimetres of grass on the wicket, making it heavily favourable for the bowlers with plenty of movement and bounce under overcast skies.Greenberg said a trend towards shorter Test matches was not in Cricket Australia's interest.""A simple phrase I'd use is short Tests are bad for business. I can't be much more blunt than that,"" he said.""So I would like to see a slightly broader balance between the bat and the ball.""A host of former greats have been critical of the Melbourne pitch with former England captain Michael Vaughan on Saturday calling it ""a joke"".""This is selling the game short,"" he added, while another ex-England skipper Alastair Cook branded it ""an unfair contest"".Curators in Australia are traditionally independent when it comes to preparing pitches, both from captains and Cricket Australia.Greenberg suggested a more interventionist approach might be needed.""It's hard not to get more involved when you see the impact on the sport, especially commercially, he said.""I'm not suggesting I'll go around talking to ground staff, but we do have to have a careful eye on what our expectations are over the course of a summer.""","A total of 20 wickets tumbled on the opening day of the fourth Test between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

India T20 World Cup squad: In search of ideal combination, Agarkar & Co. drop Shubman Gill

Brief scores

BENGALURU: Age, they say, is merely a number. For proof, look no further than Virat Kohli The former India captain, who turned 37 last month, continues to defy the passage of time. With the bat, he still makes prolific youngsters look ordinary. In the field, his energy and intensity can outdo even the quickest. On Friday, at the BCCI Centre of Excellence here, it was vintage Kohli once again — only the opposition had changed.Less than 48 hours after opening Delhi’s Vijay Hazare Trophy campaign with a century against Andhra, Kohli returned to the middle, this time against Gujarat. Though he fell short of another three-figure score, stumped on 77 (61b; 13x4;1x6), his 81-minute stay at the crease was unmistakably Kohli — authoritative and brimming with control.His innings, combined with a mature knock from Rishabh Pant (70), laid the foundation for Delhi’s thrilling seven-run win. Fittingly, Kohli — who was scheduled to feature in only two matches — signed off from the tournament by pouching the winning catch, dismissing Ravi Bishnoi as Delhi sealed the contest. He was also named the man of the match.Asked to bat, Delhi posted a competitive 254/9 on a testing surface before bowling out Gujarat for 247 in 47.4 overs.At 213/6 in the 42nd over, Gujarat appeared to be in control, but a dramatic 47th over, which yielded two quick wickets, swung the momentum. As the chase tightened, Prince Yadav (3/37) delivered the final blow to close out the game.Earlier, Kohli was forced into action early after Chintan Gaja sent Priyansh Arya back in the second over. From then on, Kohli assumed command, dealing largely in boundaries. He looked in sublime touch, and a trademark on-drive off Arzan Nagwaswalla in the seventh over stood out as one of the shots of the day. The introduction of leg-spinner Bishnoi coincided with Kohli’s half-century, which he brought up in just 29 balls by slashing through the covers for four.Imperious and seemingly unstoppable, Kohli’s stay ended when he went down the track to left-arm spinner Vishal Jayswal (4/42) and missed, allowing wicketkeeper Urvil Patel to whip off the bails in a flash.At the other end, Pant, who last played an ODI in Aug last year, shelved his usual aggression for caution. Walking in with Delhi at 98/3, Pant focused on rebuilding. His half-century off 62 balls was highlighted by a clean strike off Bishnoi over long-on. His resistance ended on 70 (79 balls; 8 fours, 2 sixes) when he dropped to one knee to work Jayswal on the leg side, only to miss and see his stumps disturbed.Delhi: 254/9 in 50 overs (Virat Kohli 77, Rishabh Pant 70, Harsh Tyagi 40; Ravi Bishnoi 2-50, Vishal Jayswal 4-42)beats Gujarat: 247 in 47.4 overs (Aarya Desai 57, Urvil Patel 31, Abhishek Desai 26, Saurav Chauhan 49, Jayswal 26; Ishant Sharma 2-28, Prince Yadav 3-37, Arpit Rana 2-39)",Virat Kohli scores 77 as Delhi beat Gujarat by seven runs in Vijay Hazare Trophy. Rishabh Pant scored 70 as Delhi posted 254/9 in 50 overs. Kohli was named man of the match.

Kylie Jenner and Jordyn Woods' relationship from scandal to sisterhood

The beef between celebrities often gets stretched for decades, but not for the makeup mogul, Kylie Jenner . The young billionaire just showed that mistakes made in the past should remain there, and one should move forward with the years.When Jordyn Woods announced her engagement to New York Knicks’ Karl-Anthony Towns, the first thing the internet did was scan the comments for a reaction from her former bestie. And guess what? Kylie Jenner didn’t disappoint. Her comment painted over all the buzz around her and Wood’s relations since the scandal on Keeping Up with the Kardashians.KAT has been Wood’s rock in one of her toughest times when the internet collectively went against her over the scandal, and seeing them finally locking each other for life seems earned.Jordyn Woods, via her Instagram on Christmas Day, dropped a series of images showing KAT’s proposal, and captioned it as “Merry Christmas.”The proposal looked straight out of a romance movie as the NBA star, Karl-Anthony Towns, seemed to pull out all the stops from selecting the historic Chateau de Vaux-le-Vicomte as the proposal venue to surprising Jordyn with a massive diamond. A setting truly fit for royalty.The duo has known each each for a long time but didn’t begin dating until May 2020.That September, Jordyn told Extra, “The right person will bring a lot out of you. We have been friends for a long time. Naturally, we both connected about losing a parent at a very young age … so it was a very organic relationship that we’d been best friends for a while.”From Bella Hadid to the Olympic gold medalist, Simone Biles, multiple celebrities reacted to this post with heartfelt congratulatory messages and blessings. But what grabbed the netizens’ eyes was Kylie Jenner’s name amongst these.Jenner commented, “jordyyyyyyy” followed by a series of ""crying"" emojis. It was a moment that officially signaled the end of any lingering tension between the friends. Jordyn’s sister, Jodie, also commented, “The most deserving woman, so proud of both of you this is EVERYTHING.”Kylie Jenner’s comment might seem to some as a friend being happy for their friend, but the history behind these two makes this moment much more special. After a decade of friendship, the duo hit a rocky road in 2019 when Woods and Tristan Thompson’s were caught in a scandal during the filming of KUWTK, while the latter was dating Kylie’s sister Khloe Kardashian Following the nature of the reality show, the fallout was messy and heartbreaking while it got broadcast across the globe. It headlined the entertainment tabloids for years. However, it seems like time is truly a healing medicine. In 2023, Kylie and Jordyn were seen grabbing sushi, signaling the reconciliation. By celebrating Jordyn’s engagement today, Kylie is proving that they’ve traded the old drama for a supportive and mature friendship as it turns out that even the most complicated histories can have a happy ending.Also Read: “I’m ready to get home” — Stephen Curry shares heartfelt message for wife Ayesha Curry following Christma","Jordyn Woods announced her engagement to New York Knicks’ Karl-Anthony Towns.

A decision that remains fluid behind the scenes

Brian Schottenheimer: I Want to Take That Next Step | Dallas Cowboys 2025

Also Read:

As the Dallas Cowboys stumble toward the end of a disappointing 2025 season, one thing is no longer up for debate - Dak Prescott intends to play in Week 18.Following Dallas’ 30-23 Christmas Day win over the Washington Commanders, Prescott made his stance clear amid growing speculation that the Cowboys could rest starters in a season finale with no playoff implications. For the veteran quarterback, sitting out is not an option.“I want to play,” Prescott said when asked about the possibility of being held out. “I love this game. If I get the opportunity, I’m going to prepare the same way and give it my best.”The Cowboys enter Week 18 with a 7-8-1 record, officially eliminated from postseason contention. Expectations were far higher at the start of the year, but inconsistency on both sides of the ball - combined with injuries and defensive lapses, derailed Dallas’ playoff push.Despite the bigger picture, Prescott views the regular-season finale as more than a formality. Finishing strong, especially in a divisional matchup, still carries meaning for a locker room searching for momentum heading into the offseason.“There’s pride in that,” Prescott added. “I want to win. I want to be out there with my guys.”The Christmas Day victory came at a physical cost. Prescott was sacked six times by Washington and absorbed repeated hits behind an offensive line that struggled in the second half.Even so, he finished with 307 passing yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions, a performance that reinforced his value to the offense.Teammates were quick to rally around their quarterback, praising his toughness and leadership. Running back Javonte Williams publicly called out protection issues while commending Prescott for playing through the punishment.Head coach Brian Schottenheimer has so far echoed Prescott’s mindset, indicating that the plan remains to start the franchise quarterback in the finale. Still, with the offseason looming, the Cowboys must weigh long-term health against short-term morale.A late injury would be catastrophic for a team already facing hard questions about roster construction, coaching continuity, and overall direction.Dallas will close its season on the road against the New York Giants, offering Prescott a final chance to set a tone before months of uncertainty. Whether the Cowboys finish strong won’t change their playoff fate, but it could influence how the offseason conversation begins.For Prescott, the message is simple: seasons don’t end quietly, even when the playoffs are out of reach. As the Cowboys limp toward January, their quarterback has drawn his line, and he intends to cross it on the field.",Dak Prescott intends to play in the Dallas Cowboys' season finale.

Kenny Stills believes “Trump curse” played a part in Detroit’s late-season setback



What looked like a season heading toward meaningful January football has ended with frustration, questions, and a sense of opportunity wasted. The Detroit Lions’ campaign unraveled at the wrong time, and their 23-10 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Christmas night finally closed the door on any postseason possibility while clearing the way for the Green Bay Packers to secure their place instead.The defeat was not an isolated stumble. It capped a worrying run of form in which Detroit simply could not hold its footing during the most demanding stretch of the schedule. Performances dipped, execution failed, and the Lions repeatedly found themselves second best. By the time Minnesota controlled Thursday night’s contest, it felt like the end result had been building for weeks.As the disappointment settled, an unexpected angle resurfaced online. Former Miami Dolphins receiver Kenny Stills revisited an earlier moment from Detroit’s season, sharing a clip of Amon-Ra St. Brown’s celebration from the Lions’ convincing win over Washington. Stills suggested that the celebration invited bad luck, even calling it a “Trump curse” on Twitter, sparking debate rather than being brushed aside as harmless commentary.That celebration once symbolized Detroit’s swagger, coming in a game they controlled comfortably.What followed tells a harsher story: only two wins in seven outings, momentum gone, confidence shaken, and ultimately the playoff push slipping away. Supporters can joke about superstition, but the real issue lies in how quickly standards dropped when pressure intensified.Against Minnesota, the shortcomings were clear. Drives failed to sustain, defensive gaps appeared at crucial moments, and the Vikings showed greater composure in decisive situations. It wasn’t a curse that ended Detroit’s season; it was a mix of stalled offense, lapses in execution, and timing that worked entirely against them.Now the Lions head into the offseason knowing this one will hurt. A promising position dissolved into a late-season slide that cost them everything they were chasing. The challenge ahead is not about addressing online narratives; it is about restoring consistency, rediscovering belief, and ensuring a collapse like this does not define the group moving forward.",Kenny Stills believes “Trump curse” played a part in Detroit’s late-season setback.
