Spirit without the spirits: The coolest New Year party is now hangover-free,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/spirit-without-the-spirits-the-coolest-new-year-party-is-now-hangover-free/articleshow/126259642.cms,"Motta Maadi Music Sober Party, started by Chennai-based musician Badhri Narayanan Seshadri, is a New Year’s concert for teetotaller

'Wanted to show how one can have fun without booze'

For years, New Year's Eve came with a familiar script: you drink, you party, you recover (or regret it) later. But a growing number of Indians are now opting for a 'sober' start to 2026. ""There was a time I drank to drown my sorrows,"" says 45-year-old Mumbai-based entrepreneur Madhu Gupta. This New Year's Eve, though, her plans look very different: an early dinner at a hotel, followed by a 'Stranger Things' marathon with her teenage daughter. Alcohol doesn't figure anywhere. Even her 30-year-old niece in Bengaluru is skipping the usual party scene.Gupta and her niece are part of a growing global sober curious movement - people who are reshaping their relationship with alcohol. For some, it means giving it up entirely and for others, it might mean a shift to low-alcohol options. Health reasons and the desire to have more meaningful interactions/experiences without being wasted are driving the shift.For this crowd, the perfect Dec 31 is about music, community, and being home before the streets get wild. That's the spirit behind the Motta Maadi Music Sober Party, started by Chennai-based musician Badhri Narayanan Seshadri as a mischievous jab at New Year's excesses.Seshadri is quick to clarify that it wasn't planned as an anti-alcohol event. ""The entire team is largely teetotallers, so this is how we celebrate. Otherwise, where do teetotallers go on Dec 31? Watch television?"" he laughs. This year, their Dec 31 show will be held at Sir Mutha Venkatasubba Rao Concert Hall, with two performances at 3pm and 7pm, both featuring Tamil film music. The evening ends not with a countdown. ""We finish with 'Ilamai Idho Idho', a popular New Year song by Ilaiyaraaja,"" says Seshadri.The shift is also showing up in how venues are programming the night. In Hyderabad, rooftop cafe Ce La Vie is advertising a 'sober and sensational' New Year's party complete with a DJ, a midnight countdown and an elaborate mocktail menu. In Indore, Kaner Baag is hosting a sober New Year's Eve built around a familiar party template - a DJ night, live dhol, unlimited buffet, zero-proof cocktails and a midnight countdown with fireworks - just without the booze. The event is aimed at ""families, couples and groups looking for a safe, elegant, and premium alternative to crowded club parties"".For 21-year-old Raj Dashore, a partner at Kaner Baag and one of the organisers, the idea is a pushback against how celebrations in the city have changed over generations. ""In our parents' generation, drinking became the centre of every celebration in Indore. Every month, there's a new pub launching,"" he says. ""At Kaner Baag, we wanted to show that you can be surrounded by nature, have fun and feel calm without alcohol. ""Dry doesn't mean dull. Across the country, mixologists are leaning into technique-driven creations - think beetroot negronis and kiwi collins - designed to deliver flavour, not buzz.Hyderabad-based Meera Girija Tadimeti, an architect-turned-chef who specialises in homestyle Telugu food, says this New Year's Eve she will simply sip sparkling water or soda. ""There is more research now that shows no amount of alcohol is safe, so I made a conscious decision to say no to alcohol,"" says Tadimeti, who was a social drinker earlier. ""I don't succumb to social pressure and respect my body's limitations,"" she adds.Others are stepping away from the pressure to ""do something big"" altogether. Instead of hosting traditional New Year's Eve events, Kolkata's The Barge Company is planning a 'River Reset' weekend on Jan 3, 4 and 11 aboard its heritage vessels, Riviera and the restored Bengal Paddle. ""The first weekend of Jan should be a sober weekend. We wanted to do that by channelling the tranquillity of the river with activities like sound bath, yoga flow and iceberg mind mastery on the cruise,"" say Rishika Das Roy, marketing director at The Barge Company. ""As for drinks, we will have tea-tasting and mushroom coffee,"" she says.",A growing number of Indians are opting for a'sober' start to 2026.

Referring to the 1.12-minute teaser, which has crossed over 20 million views in three days, it quoted a Chinese expert as saying Bollywood films offer an entertainment-driven, emotionally charged portrayal. It added that no amount of cinematic exaggeration could rewrite history or shake People's Liberation Army's determination to defend China's sovereign territory.The teaser opens with a voice-over by Salman's character saying, ""Soldiers, remember, if you get wounded, treat it like a medal, and if you see death, salute it,"" and shows Indian soldiers bracing for combat as Chinese troops run towards them. According to Army sources, Indian soldiers led by Col Babu regrouped quickly and launched a ferocious response during the high-altitude standoff there.","A teaser of Salman Khan-starrer Battle of Galwan has been racking up viewership in millions.

EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: What He Saw On Fort Huachuca The Day Before Charlie Died. | Candace Ep 282

Candace Owens’ SHOCKING Declaration After 4.5-Hour Meeting With Charlie Kirk’s Widow Erika | Watch

Mitch Snow, Candace Owens, and the claims linked to Charlie Kirk’s death explained





Conservative podcaster Candace Owens has shared new details after strong online questions grew around Mitch Snow, a man she called an eyewitness in the death of Charlie Kirk . The focus is now on what Snow says he saw at Fort Huachuca in early September and whether those claims match real timelines. Candace Owens says she never treated Snow’s words as final proof. She says the real need now is clear facts that can be checked. The debate has pulled in people linked to Turning Point USA, media voices, and public figures named in Snow’s account.As the story spreads, many are asking simple questions. Who is Mitch Snow? What did he say? And what is known for sure right now? Owens says answers must come from verified records, not guesses or online anger. She has asked anyone with proof to contact her team directly so the case can move forward in a clear way.According to the Dive Pirates Foundation , Mitch Snow is a retired US Army staff sergeant. He has said he trained in Special Forces and worked as a combat medic. Snow has shared that his goal since childhood was to become a Green Beret. His military career ended after a serious training accident while scouting a drop zone. He has said he fell more than 80 feet.Mitch Snow has described injuries to his ankles, feet, knees, back, neck, and a dislocated shoulder. He says he was medically discharged and that the end of his service was very hard for him. Until recently, Snow was not known to the public.That changed after he appeared on Owens’ podcast. There, Snow said he was at Fort Huachuca in early September, around the time of Charlie Kirk’s death. He claimed he saw people he later linked to Turning Point USA. Snow said he saw Brian Harpole, described as Kirk’s head of security, leaving what he called a “top brass meeting” around 7:30 am. He also said he was “95 to 99 percent sure” he recognized Erika Kirk, either in person or from an image.“I do not know these people from TPUSA, never been associated with it,” Snow said in full during the interview. “They were there, and the head of security was one of the people walking out with the congressman,” he added.Online, many users questioned Snow’s memory and details. X user Sam Parker posted on 29 December 2025 that he was unsure if Snow was lying, mistaken, or confused. Others raised doubts about travel times and records tied to Mark Amodei. Supporters noted Snow’s son said Snow was at Fort Huachuca, but also agreed that sightings of specific people are not confirmed.Candace Owens later responded. She said she never relied only on Snow’s memory and called some attacks a “bizarre misinformation campaign.” She said, “We now need solid information on the whereabouts of all mentioned so we can move on.” Owens said claims by Alex Jones about flight records did not fully cover the time of the alleged meeting. She also noted silence or limited responses from people named, including Cabot Phillips.Right now, Mitch Snow’s claims remain allegations. No official probe has confirmed them, and no public proof has backed them. What happens next depends on clear records and verified facts, not online noise.Also Read: “Why she’s out there”: Tim Dillon highlights public confusion over Erika Kirk’s appearances following Charlie Kirk tragedy","Conservative podcaster Candace Owens has shared new details after strong online questions grew around Mitch Snow, a man she called an eyewitness in the death of Charlie Kirk.

Do y’all agree with Max’s answers?! 🤣 #anime #nba #dallasmavericks

4. Jaylen Brown (Boston Celtics)



5. Steven Adams (Houston Rockets)



Anime has come a long way from getting fully Americanized and rewritten to upholding its authenticity. It transcended the niche fandom and language barriers and showed people the world above the subtitles. In the era of global connectivity, the bridge between world-class athleticism and anime has never been shorter. And the NBA is not untouched by this wave.It is no longer surprising to see world-class athletes rocking a Naruto cloak on the hardwood or discussing the nuances of Jujutsu Kaisen during a post-game presser. Zion Williamson once famously estimated that 80% of the league watches anime, and today, that passion is visible in custom sneakers, tattoos, and pre-game rituals. Here are five NBA stars who truly live the ""otaku"" life.Zion isn't just a casual viewer, he is essentially the league's anime ambassador, especially after tattooing Naruto’s Eight Trigrams seal on his stomach. His obsession with Naruto is so deep that he has collaborated with Jordan Brand on several Naruto-inspired colorways like Rasengan. To Zion, the show is a blueprint for his career, dealing with massive expectations and internal power.He famously wore a Hokage-style outfit to Comic-Con and views the protagonist, Naruto’s way of the Ninja, as a direct parallel to his own journey through injury and scrutiny.The Kings’ explosive guard is a lifelong Dragon Ball Z fanatic. Fox has often credited the high energy of the series for his style of play. He identifies most with Vegeta, the Prince of Saiyans, admiring the character's relentless passion and drive to surpass his rivals. Fox’s love for the anime can be seen through his special Dragon Ball edition sneakers with a custom ""Vegeta"" logo featured. He has been frequently spotted at conventions, proving his fandom goes far beyond just watching the show on the team plane.Mavericks’ Daniel Gafford is an avid anime fan, especially of Dragon Ball Z and recently of Demon Slayer. He has a prominent tattoo of Goku, Vegeta, and Gohan on his left knee, representing his admiration for his childhood heroes. Recently, Gafford also added a fresh tattoo on his hand of Rengoku from Demon Slayer. Gafford doesn't just watch for the action, he uses it as a mental reset to never give up.Celtics star guard Jaylen Brown is a known anime fan and is drawn to the creative storytelling, along with the psychological and philosophical plots. He has praised Death Note for its complex morality and Demon Slayer for its stunning animation. The 2024 Finals MVPviews anime as something that challenges the brain and often shares his recommendations with younger teammates to help them expand their creative horizons beyond the court.The NBA’s strongest man and Rockets star center is a big One Piece fan. The anime’s pirate-like personality fits Adams perfectly. In an interview, Adams admitted that he spent much of his downtime during injury rehab catching up on the 1,000+ episodes of One Piece. In 2019, Crunchyroll tweeted promoting Steven Adams for the All-Star Game. Other anime that Adams has shown interest in are: One Punch Man, Naruto, and Hunter X Hunter.The stigma around being an anime-head in professional sports is slowly evaporating, and these players prove that you can be a ruthless competitor on the hardwood while still finding inspiration in the vibrant, emotional worlds of Japanese animation. Whether it’s a Kamehameha celebration or a custom pair of kicks, the Anime NBA era is officially here to stay.Also read: 6 heartwarming Klay Thompson and Megan Thee Stallion moments fans couldn’t stop smiling about in 2025","Anime has come a long way from getting fully Americanized and rewritten to upholding its authenticity.

Nikola Jokic suffered a knee hyperextension vs Heat, MRI Tuesday, return timeline unclear

Nikola Jokic has faced multiple injuries over his career, with a fresh left knee setback in 2025 now under review

Fans of the Denver Nuggets are eagerly awaiting word on the condition of three-time MVP Nikola Jokic, who suffered a left knee injury against the Miami Heat on Monday night. With just six seconds remaining in the second quarter, Jokic sustained the injury. Despite being listed as questionable to return, he never played again.The Denver Nuggets may soon be put to the test after spending the offseason assembling a team that could at least survive without Nikola Jokic. Fans of the Nuggets and the NBA as a whole who like seeing an all-time great player fill the stat sheet were alarmed when Jokic left Monday night's game against the Miami Heat due to a knee injury and did not return.During Monday's game against the Heat, Jokic seemed to hyperextend his knee after teammate Spencer Jones stepped on him beneath the basket. A hyperextension is defined by the Cleveland Clinic as ""an injury that happens when your knee is bent backward beyond its usual limit.""Usually, a hyperextension is an occurrence that can result in knee ligament damage rather than a diagnosis in and of itself. Jokic must thus have an MRI on Tuesday to ascertain the precise nature of his knee injury.As they assess how long the former MVP will be sidelined, the Nuggets hope that Jokic largely avoided ligament injury, with the ACL being the most important of the group. Jokic, meanwhile, left with a noticeable limp after collapsing to the ground in agony and never came back.David Adelman, the coach of the Nuggets, claimed that Jokic realized the injury right away. On Thursday, January 1, 2026, the team will play the Raptors. Nuggets coach David Adelman said after the game:“Immediately, he knew something was wrong… This is part of the NBA. Anyone who gets hurt, it’s gut-wrenching, especially somebody as special as he is.”Apart from announcing that Jokic would get an MRI on Tuesday, Nuggets coach David Adelman was unable to provide much of an update following the defeat. Adelman stated that the Nuggets ""will go through the process properly"" and that he is ""hoping for the best.""It is anticipated that Jokic's timetable won't be known until after Tuesday's MRI.Jokic might still miss a lot of time even if he doesn't get a serious injury. That would be an uncommon development for the three-time MVP, who hasn't missed more than five straight games since 2017. During his rise to MVP status, Jokic established himself as one of the NBA's most resilient players.Throughout his career, Nikola sustained several serious injuries. This prevented him from appearing in court for a considerable amount of time. But each time he went back to the court, he made sure to make an impression.The athlete's most recent injury occurred during the Miami Heat game. Due to a serious knee injury, he was unable to play in the second half of the match. Let's examine all of the significant ailments the Nuggets player has suffered over his career while supporters wait for an update on his setback.Jokic's most recent injury was a left knee injury in 2025. It happened in the closing minutes of the Miami Heat game's first half. Jokic unintentionally tread on Spencer Jones' toes. Jokic did not return for the second half of the game after hobbling off the court. We are awaiting the team's comprehensive report.In terms of injuries, the athlete's year does not appear to be going well. Both Jokic and Jamal Murray had to miss a few games in the first half of the season owing to injuries. Jokic has a bruise to his right shooting elbow in addition to an ankle impingement that limited his range of motion. The sportsman was given a severe instruction to rest by Denver Nuggets coach Michael Malone. Jokic's ankle ailment kept him out of several games.Also read: ""He wasn't the superstar he is now""- Michael Porter Jr. opens up on doubting Nikola Jokic’s greatness in Denver Nuggets training camp","Nikola Jokic left Monday night's game against the Miami Heat due to a knee injury and did not return.

Nikita Kucherov finishes the year on good note as Tampa Bay Lightning star named NHL’s First Star of the Week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nikita-kucherov-finishes-the-year-on-good-note-as-tampa-bay-lightning-star-named-nhls-first-star-of-the-week/articleshow/126252253.cms,"Nikita Kucherov named NHL First Star of the Week (Image via: Getty Images)

Nikita Kucherov named NHL’s First Star of the Week, Lightning get their game back on track



Ending the year on a good note, Nikita Kucherov has stepped up once again for the Tampa Bay Lightning at exactly the right time. The star forward has delivered a strong stretch of hockey, scoring four goals and putting up six points in his last three games while helping Tampa Bay win all three matchups during an important part of their season.This run has earned him the NHL’s First Star of the Week, and it feels fitting. Kucherov didn’t just pile up numbers in easy situations. He produced when games were physical, tense, and could have slipped away, showing the kind of control and composure that separates elite players from everyone else.The Lightning needed leadership and finishing, and Kucherov provided both. After a heated, demanding rivalry game against the Florida Panthers, Tampa Bay nearly let a comfortable 4–1 lead vanish against the Montreal Canadiens before pulling through in a shootout. Even with momentum swings and pressure moments, Kucherov stayed sharp, continued creating offense, and played with the calm presence his team relies on.His overall season numbers back up the recognition. With 17 goals and 49 points in 34 games, Kucherov remains one of the league’s top offensive producers and sits firmly in the NHL’s scoring race alongside names like Connor McDavid Nathan MacKinnon , Macklin Celebrini, and a handful of other elite forwards.His pace may be slightly behind last season’s extraordinary production, but that does not take away from the impact he is still having.There is also plenty of time ahead. With more than half the schedule still remaining, Kucherov has room to push his totals even higher and possibly work his way back toward the 120-point range once again. If he does that, the Art Ross Trophy conversation will quickly include him, although the competition remains extremely tight.For Tampa Bay, his current form brings stability and confidence. It reassures the team that their star forward is still driving the attack and capable of lifting them when games get difficult. For the wider NHL picture, it simply reinforces what has been true for years: when Kucherov is locked in, he remains one of the most dangerous and reliable offensive players in the league, and he is making sure the Lightning close the year with real momentum.Also Read: What is Nikita Kucherov's net worth in 2025?

Stefon Diggs’ legal battle: Court developments and impact on Patriots’ season

New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs is facing serious legal trouble in Massachusetts, with assault and strangulation charges filed against him following an alleged December 2 incident. This has rapidly evolved into a central issue for the Patriots, introducing legal concerns and organizational challenges just as the team moves into a critical stretch.According to court filings reported by CBS Boston, the 32-year-old receiver has been charged with felony strangulation or suffocation along with misdemeanor assault and battery. The case has been brought in Dedham District Court, though limited information about the alleged incident is publicly available at this stage.Stefon Diggs has strongly denied the accusations, calling them “categorically false” through statements released by the New England Patriots and his legal team. The Patriots said they support the player while continuing to collect information and cooperating with authorities and the NFL. Diggs’ attorney David Meier went further, describing the accusations as “unsubstantiated” and linked to a financial dispute, arguing that the claims were never investigated because “they did not occur.Diggs is scheduled to appear in court for arraignment on January 23. During a recent court appearance, attorney Michael DiStefano asked that the contents of the police report be kept sealed for now, pointing to the ongoing nature of the case. Prosecutors didn’t oppose the request, but the judge stressed that there is a clear public interest and said transparency also matters in a situation like this. DiStefano also revealed that Diggs has made a financial offer to the alleged victim, and both sides are currently discussing a possible resolution.The NFL has not publicly addressed possible league action. Diggs joined New England in March on a three-year, $69 million deal after returning from an ACL injury and quickly became a central offensive weapon. He played a key role in the team’s AFC East title win over the New York Jets last weekend, finishing with 101 receiving yards and a touchdown. Off the field, Diggs is also a father, having welcomed a baby boy with rapper Cardi B in November, which has added to the public interest in his personal and professional life.At this point, the case remains an active legal matter. The Patriots, the league, and fans across the NFL are now waiting on the court process to determine what comes next, both legally and for Diggs’ playing future.Also Read: Stefon Diggs contract incentives explained after Patriots shuffle roster","New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs is facing assault and strangulation charges.

Memphis Matchup and Game Outlook

ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers’ game against the Memphis Grizzlies on December 30, 2025. The Sixers listed their star center as questionable, leaving his availability unresolved just hours before tip-off.Philadelphia enters the game at 16-14 and riding a three-game losing streak. Injuries have played a role in that slide, and Embiid’s absence has been especially noticeable. Memphis, sitting at 15-17, is dealing with its own inconsistencies, but the matchup carries weight for both teams as the season reaches its midpoint.Joel Embiid missed Philadelphia’s last game, a 129-104 loss to Oklahoma City, due to a right ankle sprain along with ongoing right knee injury management. The ankle issue is new, while the knee has been a recurring problem throughout the season.He has since been upgraded from out to questionable. Head coach Nick Nurse is expected to make a final decision after his pregame evaluation. At 31, Embiid has already missed enough games to put award eligibility at risk, making every lineup decision more significant.Before sitting out against the Thunder, Joel Embiid showed he can still control games when available.He scored 31 points against Chicago, shooting 10-of-19 from the field in 32 minutes.On the season, he is averaging 21.8 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 2.8 assists while shooting 44.3 percent. Those numbers are lower than his MVP season, but his presence still changes how defenses play Philadelphia.The Philadelphia 76ers remain thin in other areas. Kelly Oubre Jr. is out with a left knee sprain, and Trendon Watford continues to miss time due to a left adductor strain. Two-way players MarJon Beauchamp and Johni Broome are listed as doubtful.Tyrese Maxey and Paul George are expected to play. Maxey has carried the offense at 30.7 points per game. If Embiid cannot go, Quentin Grimes and Andre Drummond take on larger roles, with Drummond anchoring the paint.The Memphis Grizzlies are ninth in the West and rely heavily on Jaren Jackson Jr. for interior defense.

Iyo Sky’s WWE salary and contract growth

From Stardom to global star, Japan career and legacy earnings

Endorsements, merchandise, and net worth outlook in 2025

With the Japanese wrestling star now regularly in the main-event picture for WWE women, Iyo Sky's net worth in 2025 has been a popular conversation piece. Her earnings today, from championship bonuses to merchandise sales, attest to a career that has transitioned over time from cult fandom to global household name.Although numbers aren't released, the path from Japan's top promotions to WWE's biggest stages paints a picture of how the best wrestlers create generational wealth. Whether it be salary, bonuses, licensing fees, or the value of the brand she continues to create, all will impact her financial position in 2025.According to the report, Iyo Sky has built her earning potential significantly since signing with WWE and moving up the ranks from NXT to the main roster. Wrestlers of her stature usually earn a base salary, plus performance bonuses, pay-per-view bonuses, and a cut from merchandise sales. With observers estimating the annual WWE revenue at Sky in recent peaks to be at a mid-to-high six-figure amount, with recent high-profile title changes typically triggering renegotiated rights prices or bonus clauses.Individual contracts are not a matter of public record with WWE, but women’s champions find numbers on the high end of roster averages, applied through exposure and marketing value of a particular talent, although the far-appraised annual salary is difficult to determine.This places Sky in a strong negotiating position as WWE becomes her number one income source in 2025, and we're not talking her sole means of income.Sky made a name for herself in Japan prior to WWE, particularly in World Wonder Ring Stardom, where she was one of the promotion's defining talents. They were years that delivered long-lasting value to the brand as well as reliable income. Profits are still used to provide art for the calendars and T-shirts of the time, and continued popularity with fans in Japan contributes to her earnings from there too, despite her fully switching to the WWE a while ago.She gained a higher notoriety in foreign countries, which in turn made her transition into WWE a lot easier and money better! Analysts include these early career earnings in net-worth estimates, as well as the ongoing royalty checks, which, though small compared to her WWE pay today, add up over time.Outside of her wrestling pay, Sky also makes money from WWE merchandise, video games, and there have also been some brand deals here and there. For performers with stronger fan bases, such as champions who regularly appear on TV, merchandise royalties can add to significant sums. She also gets a cut of WWE's digital and licensing ecosystem that includes collectibles and gaming.Also Read: Roxanne Perez net worth in 2025: WWE earnings, contracts, endorsements, brand deals, and rising career","Iyo Sky's net worth in 2025 will depend on her WWE earnings, endorsements, and brand deals.

Belle Delphine and twomad’s 2022 collaboration resurfaces after viral tweet







Belle Delphine is alive. A viral post on X confused many people, but the claim about her death is not true. The rumor started after an old photo of Belle Delphine and YouTuber twomad began trending again on Monday, December 29. The image was shared by the X account @LostMemeArchive with the caption, “this did not age well at all.”Soon after, another user, @neo_jery, quote-posted the image and wrote, “notice how everyone in this image is dead.” That single line caused panic online. Many users believed both people in the photo had passed away.However, X later added a Community Note to the post to clear the confusion. The note said, “While the poster is correct about the death of Twomad (on right), Belle Delphine (on left) is still alive and active to this day.”The facts are clear. Twomad died in February 2024 at the age of 23. Belle Delphine is alive and has been fully active on social media. She is sharing posts as recently as last week. No news outlet has reported her death. The viral claim is false and misleading.Belle Delphine, whose real name is Mary-Belle Kirschner, became famous online for her cosplay style and bold internet persona. She first went viral in 2019 after selling her bath water for $30 a bottle, a move that shocked and amused the internet.On June 23, 2022, Belle Delphine shared photos from a collaboration with YouTuber twomad, whose real name was Muudea Sedik. The pictures showed them dressed as Buzz Lightyear and Woody from Toy Story. The shoot took place in a hotel room and featured playful poses. Belle Delphine captioned the post, “Hosting the paralympics in a hotel room was weird…”Twomad was best known for gaming videos and comedy skits. Because of that, the collaboration surprised many of his fans. Some questioned the pairing and shared mixed reactions online. Later, a second set of images from the same shoot showed twomad dressed as Donkey Kong, while Belle Delphine appeared as Princess Peach from the Mario franchise.After Twomad's death in 2024, these photos began circulating again.

What happened to Kyren Williams in Week 17?

What this means for the Rams

Also Read:

The Los Angeles Rams took a breath of relief after Week 17, as concerns around Kyren Williams’ health ultimately proved to be a scare rather than a setback. The Rams’ lead running back was evaluated late during the game against the Atlanta Falcons, but all signs now point toward him being available moving forward.Williams, who has been central to Sean McVay’s offensive plans this season, briefly raised alarm bells when he appeared to be dealing with ankle discomfort during the fourth quarter. Television cameras caught the 25-year-old wincing on the sideline, prompting speculation about another potential injury at a critical stage of the year.Williams admitted postgame that he was checked for an ankle issue late in the loss to Atlanta. The concern stemmed from multiple awkward tackles around his lower leg and ankle area, including one at the end of a key 22-yard run in the closing stages.However, Williams revealed that recent medical history worked in his favor. He credited a previous tightrope procedure designed to stabilize the ankle joint for preventing what could have been a far more serious injury. The running back did not miss any snaps and finished the game strongly despite the brief evaluation.As of now, the Rams have not placed Williams on the injury report with any major designation. There is no indication that he suffered a high-ankle sprain or structural damage, and team officials remain optimistic about his availability.The situation is especially significant given the Rams’ thin backfield depth at the moment. Blake Corum exited the game earlier with injury and did not return after halftime, while Ronnie Rivers was forced into a larger role behind Williams. Had Williams gone down as well, Los Angeles would have been left dangerously short-handed.Williams’ importance to the Rams cannot be overstated. Against the Falcons, he finished with 92 rushing yards on 13 carries and added 38 receiving yards, with most of his production coming in the second half. His ability to push through discomfort and remain effective highlighted his value as both a runner and a pass-catching option.With the postseason picture already settled for Los Angeles, maintaining Williams’ health is now a priority rather than pushing him unnecessarily. Head coach Sean McVay is expected to take a cautious approach if there is any lingering soreness, especially with Corum’s status still uncertain.Barring any setbacks in practice, Kyren Williams is expected to remain available for the Rams in the season finale and beyond. While the ankle scare drew attention, the outcome appears favorable, with no long-term concerns at this stage.",Los Angeles Rams running back Kyren Williams was evaluated for an ankle injury late in the game against the Atlanta Falcons.

Taylor Swift’s Christmas Day appearance at Arrowhead Stadium wasn’t the only time she was around the Kansas City Chiefs during the holiday season. While she was seen supporting fiancé Travis Kelce during the game, another moment from her time with the team quietly surfaced later and offered a calmer, more personal glimpse into the festive week.A year-end Instagram Reel shared by Ana Demmer, partner of Chiefs center Creed Humphrey, included a photo from a Chiefs holiday gathering. The image showed several players’ partners posing together, and Swift appeared casually in the back-left corner. Brittany Mahomes stood on the opposite side in a blue dress, while Swift’s familiar red lipstick stood out even though her full look wasn’t visible. It was a simple snapshot, but it highlighted how she has become naturally present around the team and the people connected to it.With off-field moments noted, attention turns directly back to football. The Kansas City Chiefs have just one regular-season game remaining on January 4 against the Las Vegas Raiders on the road. Their loss to the Los Angeles Chargers on December 14 confirmed that the Chiefs are out of postseason contention, meaning this final matchup will officially close their 2025–26 campaign.That situation has intensified discussion around Kelce at a professional level.Two straightforward questions surround him at this stage: Will he play in the final game, and is this going to be his last NFL season? His workload, age, and long career have already fueled conversations about whether retirement may come sooner rather than later. Missing the playoffs adds another layer to that conversation, simply because it marks the end of competitive football for the team this season, and decisions often take shape around moments like this.Kelce remains a central figure in Kansas City, and any decision he makes carries real importance for the organization. Whether he suits up against the Raiders or not, the final game becomes significant because of what it could represent for both the veteran tight end and the Chiefs moving forward.As the regular season winds down, the Chiefs finish a challenging year, and clarity on Kelce’s future becomes the key storyline.

GM Bibisara Assaubayeva Exclusive: Sindarov’s World Cup win, Candidates ambitions, and more #chess

NEW DELHI: World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen once again showcased his endgame brilliance, clinching a record-extending ninth World Blitz title to go with the Rapid gold medal he won two days earlier. However, Indian Grandmaster Arjun Erigaisi endured a dramatic collapse in the semifinals and had to settle for a bronze medal at the World Blitz Championship on Tuesday.In the title match against young Uzbek GM Nodirbek Abdusattorov, Carlsen turned down a draw and produced a stunning, unexpected pawn move in the fourth game to seal a 2.5–1.5 victory, further cementing his dominance in blitz chess.After the first three games, both the players were tied at 1.5 points each.The victory was all the more sweet and fulfilling for the Norwegian after a string of losses in the qualifying (Swiss round) where he literally struggled to secure a place in the knockout semifinals.A draw in Round 19 against Abdusattorov saw both Carlsen (13.5 points) and the Uzbek (13 points) secure the last two slots in the semifinals on Tuesday behind sole leader Erigaisi (15 points) and American GM Fabiano Caruana (14 points).Carlsen then went on to beat Caruana 3-1 to secure a place in the final, while an impeccable Abdusattorov inflicted a shattering 2.5-0.5 semifinal defeat on Erigaisi, as the Indian settled for a second bronze, after taking the third-podium spot in Rapid on Sunday.Nonetheless, the two bronze medals is a remarkable achievement for the 22-year-old Erigaisi, who will return home more resolute.The achievement also made Erigaisi only the second Indian male player after the legendary Viswanathan Anand to win a World Blitz medal in the 'Open category'.Earlier, Erigaisi, after stunning the likes of Carlsen and Abdusattorov to emerge sole leader with 10 points from 13 games, went through the remaining six rounds on Tuesday with steely resolve.He won four and drew two to remain sole leader with 15 points to secure a place in the semifinals.The Indian was drawn against 2021 World Rapid champion Abdusattorov, who secured a place in the last-four by the skin of the teeth, nudging Frenchman Maxime Vachier-Lagrave to fifth spot on 'best tie-break' rule after both the Grandmasters had ended on 13 points each.With Erigaisi in stunning form and having the advantage of beating Abdusattorov on Monday, the Indian was expected to go full steam.But things took a different and difficult turn for Erigaisi. He could not convert the advantage with white in the opening game, losing in 47 moves to be 0-1 down.A resurgent Abdusattorov turned things decisively his way in the second game by playing Rc5' on the 75th move and finishing the game in 83 moves.With the Uzbek needing only half-a-point to seal his place in the final, Abdusattorov settled for a quick draw with black pieces after just 33 moves despite being in a winning position, rendering the fourth game redundant.(With inputs from PTI)","World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen wins ninth World Blitz title.

With the medals, he also became the first Indian player to register podium finishes at both events since Viswanathan Anand won the Rapid section and finished third in Blitz back in 2017.This came after he had already won a bronze in the Rapid section earlier in the tournament. Winning medals in both formats at the same championship is very rare and shows the player's consistency.

Abdusattorov won the first two games, while the third game ended in a draw.As a result, Arjun had to settle for the bronze medal, while five-time World Champion and top-ranked chess player Magnus Carlsen and Abdusattorov moved on to play the final, where Carlsen's astute end-game manoeuvres eventually earned him a coveted win over Abdusattorov with a 2.5-1.5 score.Subsequently, Carlsen clinched the Blitz gold here as well after becoming champion in the Rapid section on Sunday.On the other hand, Bibisara Assaubayeva of Kazakhstan became the Women's World Blitz Champion.Despite the disappointment at the end, Arjun’s overall performance in the Blitz Championship was impressive.On both occasions, Arjun came very close to reaching the final and fighting for the championship title.He topped the Swiss segment of the Blitz tournament with a strong score of 15 points out of 19. But perhaps luck was not in his favour.Still, the bigger picture remains very positive.Arjun Erigaisi finished third in the Blitz event and added another bronze medal to his tally, meaning he has wrapped up his final tournament of the year, the World Rapid and Blitz Championships, with two bronze medals.While the ending may have been painful for him and his fans, as the result could've been better, Arjun’s performance showed that he belongs among the world’s best.",Arjun Erigaisi won bronze medals in both the Rapid and Blitz events.

What has it been like playing under UP captain

Dhruv Jurel’s maiden List A century — an unbeaten 160 off 101 balls against Baroda in Rajkot on Dec 29 — has come at a time when India are set to play a three-match home ODI series against New Zealand. The Uttar Pradesh wicketkeeperbatter’s form has pushed him into the selection conversation. Jurel has begun the Vijay Hazare Trophy by scoring 307 runs in three matches at an average of 153.5.Winning is what matters. All 11 players work towards one goal. Every contribution counts — someone scoring 30 off 15 balls can be as valuable as someone scoring 100. Matches are won through team effort, so I’m very happy.I’m always excited to play red-ball cricket and am very fortunate to have played Tests for India. Test cricket has its own value. When you go abroad and people call you a Test cricketer, it feels good. Red-ball is close to my heart and brings a different kind of respect. I’m already thinking about our series in Sri Lanka in 7-8 months, how I can prepare, the sessions we get with spinners, how I can tackle spin better. These little things — the planning and visualisation — keep going on.I don’t set too many goals for myself. I focus on the process. Even before the Vijay Hazare Trophy, when I got some time, I was batting for 4-5 hours and creating scenarios in my mind about what I can do. Whatever the result and selection may be, no one can take my hard work away from me. That’s why I work hard. It has brought me this far and will take me further.It has been very good.

Dwight Freeney explains why winning may push Maxx Crosby toward change



Also read

For a long time, Maxx Crosby was the last player anyone expected to question his future with the Las Vegas Raiders. He played hurt, spoke about loyalty, and made it clear he wanted to be part of the franchise’s turnaround. That is why the current situation feels different. As the offseason approaches, Crosby’s name is suddenly at the center of trade talk.The reason is simple. Winning has not followed him. Crosby has done his part year after year, but the Raiders have not taken the next step. Tensions inside the locker room have grown, and recent events around his health only added fuel to the conversation. Former players are now openly wondering if staying in Las Vegas still makes sense for him.Former NFL star Dwight Freeney shared his thoughts on Up & Adams, focusing on what Crosby is missing most in his career. “The feeling of winning; there’s no feeling like that,” Freeney said. “When you win in the playoffs, and when you go to the playoffs, win a Super Bowl, those are the moments that stay with you forever.”The Raiders last made the playoffs in 2021. Since then, Crosby has collected Pro Bowl selections and signed a massive three-year, $106.5 million extension with $91.5 million guaranteed.His effort has never been questioned. His frustration, however, is becoming harder to ignore.Crosby injured his knee during the Raiders’ 31-0 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 7 but kept playing. In Week 17, Las Vegas finally shut him down against the New York Giants, placing him on injured reserve even though he wanted to stay on the field. Head coach Pete Carroll later said Crosby could also miss the season finale. Reports followed that Crosby wanted to leave the facility after hearing the decision.The timing matters. Crosby’s contract looks huge, but it is flexible. If the Raiders move him early in the 2026 league year, the dead-cap hit is small and the cap savings are large. After March 17, trading him becomes far more difficult. He also has no guaranteed money after 2026, which puts pressure on both sides to act soon.Trade ideas are already forming. Kay Adams has openly backed the Chicago Bears. “I’m rooting for him to be a Bear,” she said. “He’s a Michigan kid. He’s going to thrive in the cold, wherever that stadium is built.”Teams like the Baltimore Ravens, Dallas Cowboys, Los Angeles Chargers, Detroit Lions, and Cincinnati Bengals could also make sense. But, nothing is decided yet.","Dwight Freeney explains why winning may push Maxx Crosby toward change.

A moment of respect after a frustrating loss

Shedeur Sanders continues to grow under pressure

Shedeur Sanders Postgame Press Conference | Week 17 vs. Pittsburgh Steelers

Also Read:

The Cleveland Browns’ 13-6 upset win over the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 17 delivered more than just a shake-up in the AFC playoff picture. It also produced a rare postgame moment that resonated well beyond the final score, as veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers shared a message of encouragement with Browns rookie Shedeur Sanders.With Pittsburgh needing a victory to clinch the AFC North, the pressure was squarely on Rodgers and the Steelers offense. Instead, Cleveland’s defense controlled the tempo, and Sanders did just enough to guide the Browns to a gritty divisional win. But it was what happened after the final whistle that lingered longest.As cameras rolled on the field at Huntington Bank Field, Rodgers was spotted approaching Sanders with a smile. Despite the disappointment of a loss that complicated Pittsburgh’s postseason path, the 42-year-old quarterback took time to acknowledge the rookie’s effort.“Good job, man. Rooting for you. I’m proud of you,” Rodgers was heard telling Sanders, a brief exchange that quickly made the rounds on social media.For Sanders, still navigating the steep learning curve of his first NFL season, the words carried weight. Praise from a future Hall of Famer, especially one known for his competitive edge, offered validation during a year filled with scrutiny and adjustment.On the field, Sanders’ performance reflected progress rather than polish. He finished the game with controlled decision-making, avoided major mistakes, and leaned on the Browns’ defense to secure the win. The result moved him to 2-4 as a starter, a modest record that nonetheless highlights incremental growth.Facing a Steelers defense built on pressure and physicality, Sanders showed composure in key moments. While Cleveland’s offense scored just 13 points, it was enough on a day when defense ruled.After the game, Sanders downplayed the significance of sharing the field with Rodgers, sticking to the grounded tone that has defined his rookie season. At just 23, he has repeatedly emphasized learning and enjoyment over legacy moments.Sanders also received encouragement from Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin, who embraced the rookie and offered his own words of support. The exchange underscored a broader theme from Sunday: respect across generations, even in defeat.The moment carried an added historical layer. Nearly two decades ago, Sanders’ father, Deion Sanders, faced Rodgers when the latter was a rookie in Green Bay. This time, the roles were reversed: Rodgers the veteran, Sanders the newcomer with Cleveland emerging on top.For the Cleveland Browns, the win offered reassurance amid a rebuilding season. For the Pittsburgh Steelers, it meant a delayed celebration and a tense Week 18 ahead.And for Shedeur Sanders, the quiet exchange with Aaron Rodgers became a reminder that even in a learning season, respect from the league’s elite can mark meaningful progress.","The Cleveland Browns beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 13-6 in Week 17.

From overwhelming love in Angola to a personal DNA reveal planned for the tour finale

irl stream in Angola 🇦🇴





Darren Watkins, aka “IShowSpeed,” has been teasing his Africa tour for quite some time, and the popular streamer kept his word. The 20-year-old YouTube and Twitch star officially kicked off his highly anticipated Speed Does Africa tour on December 29, 2025, starting in Angola. He was immediately struck by the ambiance and the welcome he received during his stream.Watkins was also pretty much swept up by all the love and lively atmosphere during the tour while also reflecting on his Angolan roots. The streamer also promised fans that he would reveal proper detailed information about his ethnicity by the end of the tour. Safe to say, this journey has been his most personal and introspective so far among his travels around the world.Midway through his Angola broadcast, IShowSpeed paused to take in his environment and to reflect on what he was feeling in the moment. Surrounded by locals and the constant attention, the streamer could not hide his excitement. He told viewers, ""Bro, I'm not going to lie, bro, I love the love in Africa, bro. The energy here is crazy. The energy and love, bro. I really do love the love and energy here, bro. Oh, I keep speaking Portuguese.That same stream also showed a rather quirky moment between Speed and a local individual. A man on a motorcycle approached Speed asking for money, leading to an awkward but calm exchange. Speed addressed it directly on stream, where he told the individual asking for $100 to wait, as he does not have cash at hand.Further on, Speed confirmed that his African tour will end with a long-awaited reveal of his ethnicity and DNA test results. He has teased this for months, telling fans he is 80% African and 20% European. During the Angola stream, he hinted strongly at Angolan roots, responding to a viewer’s question by saying, ""'How much Angola DNA you have?' It's a lot. It's a lot of percent. I'm not going to reveal, like, how much percent. ”With plans to visit 20 countries, including Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt, Kenya, and Ivory Coast, Speed Does Africa is shaping up to be more than a tour for the streamer. It was a more personal and spiritual journey for a man coming back to his home country and connecting with his roots. With all the love and support he’s receiving, he is bound to revisit and feel it all over again.Also read: Full list of countries on IShowSpeed’s Africa tour as it officially begins","Darren Watkins, aka ""IShowSpeed,"" officially kicked off his Africa tour on December 29, 2025.

Unnao Rape Case: Activists Protest Outside Delhi High Court Over Sengar Bail

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

GURGAON: A 25-year-old woman who took a lift in a van on Monday night was allegedly raped and assaulted by two men inside the moving vehicle and thrown out while it was still in motion on Gurgaon-Faridabad road, leaving her with deep facial injuries that needed 12 stitches.Police said she was held captive for nearly three hours as the van made its way through isolated stretches in Faridabad amid dense fog.Following a complaint by the woman's family, a case was registered at Kotwali police station. A crime branch team detained two suspects on Tuesday, police sources said.According to the complaint, the woman had left home around 8.30pm on Monday after an argument with her mother and told her sister she was going to a friend's house. Although she had said she would return home in two to three hours, she got delayed while leaving.By the time she eventually left, it was around midnight. Unable to get any transport, the woman accepted a lift in the van.There were two men inside it, police said.

Police said she was taken beyond Hanuman temple on the stretch.The woman screamed for help but with few people on the road in biting cold and fog, none heard her cries. The two men, the family alleged, took turns to rape her. Around 3am on Tuesday, the woman was pushed out of the van near Mula Hotel at Raja Chowk in SGM Nagar.The woman managed to contact her sister, who took her to hospital. Doctors later referred her to a Delhi hospital, but her family admitted her to a private facility in Faridabad.","A 25-year-old woman who took a lift in a van on Monday night was allegedly raped and assaulted by two men inside the moving vehicle.
