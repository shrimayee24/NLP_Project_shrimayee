The man behind Taylor Swift's love songs: Why Joe Alwyn’s influence may outlast Travis Kelce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/the-man-behind-taylor-swifts-love-songs-why-joe-alwyns-influence-may-outlast-travis-kelce/articleshow/120408796.cms,"Joe Alwyn’s quiet impact on Taylor Swift’s music (Images via Getty Images & GC)

Joe Alwyn’s quiet impact on Taylor Swift’s music still echoes beyond her romance with Travis Kelce

Before Travis Kelce became the center of Taylor Swift ’s high-profile love life, there was a quieter presence who may have shaped her art in ways the public never fully grasped—Joe Alwyn. The British actor and longtime partner of Swift spent six years in a deeply private relationship with the pop megastar, one that influenced some of her most emotionally layered songs.While Swift has moved on to a whirlwind romance with the NFL superstar, fans and critics alike are beginning to question whether Alwyn’s impact might be more lasting—not just emotionally, but artistically.Alwyn wasn’t just a partner behind the scenes. He was a collaborator too. Credited as “William Bowery,” Alwyn co-wrote several songs on Swift’s Folklore and Evermore albums, including fan favorites like “Exile” and “Betty.” These albums marked a dramatic shift in Swift’s musical direction—stripped-down, intimate, and emotionally raw. Many argue that this era, shaped heavily during her time with Alwyn, may be one of her most critically acclaimed periods.In a recent interview, Alwyn made it clear that he has moved on, stating: “We’re talking about something that’s a while ago now in my life… that’s for other people.” Still, his calm detachment hasn’t stopped fans from dissecting every lyric, every metaphor, and every song believed to be inspired by their relationship.Meanwhile, her current romance with Kelce has sparked headlines, stadium appearances, and viral videos. But while it's certainly generated buzz, it hasn’t yet shown signs of shaping her music in the same profound way.Swift’s connection with Alwyn was largely hidden from the spotlight, allowing for a level of emotional intimacy that fans say they felt in her lyrics. In contrast, her relationship with Kelce is all over social media, paparazzi pages, and football broadcasts.The question remains: will this new, ultra-public chapter of Swift’s life translate into the same kind of soul-stirring music? Or will Joe Alwyn, the invisible muse, continue to cast a longer shadow over her songwriting legacy?Also Read: Is Taylor Swift too ‘white bread’ for Coachella’s cool crowd?

The last SmackDown before WrestleMania 41 set the tone for what fans can expect at the two-night weekend extravaganza in Las Vegas.WWE brought the final SmackDown before WrestleMania 41 from the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. The night featured the traditional Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, a top title match, memorable moments, and an intense clash between John Cena and Cody Rhodes in the main event segment.Seth Rollins came to the ring and sat in CM Punk's style on the mat to cut his promo. He called his upcoming main event match against CM Punk and Roman Reigns 12 years in the making and berated both of his opponents. Rollins also spoke about how Paul Heyman brought all three together years ago and claimed to save the future of the business by beating both of the WWE superstars.The match started with 26 superstars from RAW and SmackDown. It was a jam-packed action contained in the ring as superstars began to toss each other over the top rope. The match came down to the final four: Shinsuke Nakamura, Andrade El Idolo, Carmelo, and Rey Fenix. Nakamura was the first to be eliminated by Andrade. El Grande Americano appeared out of nowhere to eliminate Rey Fenix.The segment began with Rhea Ripley addressing her triple-threat match at WrestleMania 41 for the WWE Women's World Championship. She was then joined by her opponents, IYO Sky and Bianca Belair. As tensions heated, Naomi made her presence to confront Bianca about ignoring her and was ready to talk down Jade Cargill. Just then, Cargill arrived in the ring, and Naomi pushed her to Rhea Ripley. This led to all five women brawling, with the segment ending in chaos.This match was for the WWE Tag Team Championships. Both teams went back and forth against each other in tag team wrestling action. However, the ending saw DIY interfere and cause a disqualification. They attacked both teams outside the ring and took off with the tag team titles.Randy Orton came down to the ring to make it clear that he will not sit out this year at WrestleMania 41. The Viper announced that it would be the 20th time he competed at The Show of Shows. Following a loud cheer, Orton made it clear that he would be in his wrestling gear at the show and ready to battle any opponent sent his way.This was a non-title match between the two SmackDown stars. It was a slow-paced yet exciting match to witness. In a surprise turn of events, Zelina Vega connected with a top rope Super Code Red and scored the pinfall over Chelsea Green.LA Knight cut a promo, and as Solo Sikoa arrived, the brawl began outside the ring before the match started. The match between LA Knight and Solo Sikoa was a short one, as Jacob Fatu attacked LA Knight. However, Braun Strowman arrived to save LA Knight, and the duo took out Sikoa and Fatu. GM Nick Aldis came out and made an impromptu tag team match. In the end, LA Knight connected with a BFT on Solo Sikoa to pick up the win for his team.This was a six-man tag team match pitting all members of both teams against each other. It was an exciting contest that ended withRey Fenix connecting the Meteora from the top rope on Julius Creed to pick up the win for his team.John Cena shut up Cody Rhodes before he could speak. Cena berated Rhodes for not accepting The Rock's offer at Elimination Chamber. Cena revealed that in that moment, he realised it was easy to beat him at WrestleMania. After Cena gave some more heated remarks, Rhodes fired back by calling Cena overrated, over timed, and mocked his physical shape and his Hollywood appearances. The segment ended with John Cena hitting a cheap shot and trying to drop Rhodes with an AA before Rhodes countered it with a Cross Rhodes.Also read: WrestleMania 41 Night 1 and 2 matches, main event, full predictions and more","WWE brought the final SmackDown before WrestleMania 41 from the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Gujarat Titans:

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals (DC) take on Shubman Gill’s Gujarat Titans (GT) in Match No. 35 of the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Saturday. The Capitals currently sit atop the points table with 10 points from six games, while Gujarat trail just behind with eight points from eight outings.DC will walk in high on confidence after their edge-of-the-seat Super Over victory against Rajasthan Royals -- a game where Mitchell Starc turned the tide with his ice-cold death-over brilliance. The Aussie speedster, known for his pinpoint yorkers and late swing, was the architect of that heist and continues to lead the pace attack with authority.But Starc and co. will be up against a GT top order that’s looked ominous. Shubman Gill’s fluent strokeplay, Sai Sudharsan’s consistency, and Jos Buttler’s explosiveness have powered Gujarat’s batting thus far. Between them, they’ve notched up at least one fifty in every match — and DC will know that cracking that code early could unravel the Titans.On the flip side, all eyes will be on Mohammed Siraj, who’s found his groove after a testing season of international cricket. Siraj, fresh and firing, has bagged 10 wickets with a miserly economy of 8.50 — especially potent in the Powerplay. His matchup against Delhi’s young openers Jake Fraser-McGurk and Abishek Porel will be one to watch. The duo has shown flashes of potential but faces a stern examination under the Ahmedabad sun.And should early wickets fall, the Capitals will lean on veterans KL Rahul and Karun Nair to anchor the innings. Local lad Axar Patel, who plies his domestic trade for Gujarat, will be keen to shine at his home ground — especially now that he’s back in form with both bat and ball.Spin could prove decisive on a dry Ahmedabad deck. GT will back their seasoned duo of Rashid Khan and R Sai Kishore to keep things tight in the middle overs, while DC’s Kuldeep Yadav — if fit — will be their X-factor. His wrist spin has been Delhi’s trump card, ably complemented by the promising Vipraj Nigam. But Kuldeep’s availability remains in question after a shoulder niggle saw him leave the field in their last outing.Traditionally a true surface with pace and bounce, the Ahmedabad pitch this season has played slower than expected in afternoon games. Batters who apply themselves early can reap rewards later, but spinners and cutters into the surface have found assistance. With the match scheduled for 3:30 PM, dew won't be a factor, but dryness might.Jake Fraser-McGurk, Abishek Porel, KL Rahul, Karun Nair, Axar Patel (c), Tristan Stubbs, Mitchell Starc, Mukesh Kumar, Mohit Sharma, Dushmantha Chameera, Kuldeep Yadav (if fit) / Vipraj NigamAshutosh SharmaShubman Gill (c), B Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler (wk), Shahrukh Khan, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, R Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Kagiso Rabada, Washington SundarKarim JanatA dry and hot afternoon is expected in Ahmedabad, with temperatures hovering between 33°C and 41°C.

Bam Adebayo: The Ideal Frontcourt Upgrade

How Adebayo Fits with the Golden State Warriors

Thenarrowly escaped a Play-In disaster against the Memphis Grizzlies , securing the No. 7 seed in the Western Conference. But even with their postseason spot locked in, changes may be necessary this offseason—starting with moving on from Buddy Hield and pursuing Miami Heat star, as predicted by Caleb Hightower of Sporting News Buddy Hield’s early-season promise as a Klay Thompson replacement has faded. His three-point shooting, once reliable, has plummeted to concerning lows:- December: 30.5% from three- January: 31.5% from three- Play-In performance: 1-of-4 from deep against MemphisWhile Hield finished the regular season at 37.0% from beyond the arc, his inconsistency makes him a liability. As Caleb Hightower noted,If the Golden State Warriors exit the playoffs early, targeting Bam Adebayo in a trade could reshape their roster. The three-time All-Star has evolved into a complete two-way force:- 2024-25 Stats: 18.1 PPG, 9.6 RPG, 4.3 APG- Shooting Splits: 48.5% FG, 35.7% 3P- Versatility: Scores inside, handles the ball, and stretches the floorAdebayo’s growth from a defensive specialist to an offensive weapon addresses Golden State’s need for a dynamic big man.1. Scoring Boost: Provides interior scoring and mid-range efficiency.2. Playmaking: Adds a facilitator from the high post.3. Defensive Anchor: Complements Draymond Green’s versatility.The Trade ScenarioA Hield-Adebayo swap wouldn’t improve the Warriors’ outside shooting, but it would give them a proven All-Star to pair with Stephen Curry and Draymond Green.

John Rocker fumes over canceled bout with Patrick Mahomes Sr., blames “woke liberals”

Brittany and Patrick Mahomes reportedly stepped in to halt the fight

Former MLB pitcher John Rocker is once again in the spotlight, this time for launching a scathing attack on Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany Mahomes . On April 18, Rocker took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to blame the couple for canceling a scheduled celebrity boxing match against Patrick Mahomes Sr., a former minor league pitcher and father of the NFL star.“Today is the day I was supposed to fight Pat Mahomes Sr.,” John Rocker wrote in a heated post. “Instead of fighting today he backed out like a little b*tch because his son and his loser wife decided it'd be a bad look to the family name for him to get in the ring. Bunch of f***ing woke liberals.”The match, originally announced by Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, was part of the ""Rough N Rowdy"" boxing series and scheduled to take place in Wheeling, West Virginia. It stemmed from a staged altercation between Rocker and Mahomes Sr. on Bourbon Street during Super Bowl week, reportedly crafted as a publicity stunt to build hype around the fight.Court filings from Mahomes Sr.’s recent DWI case later confirmed the confrontation was orchestrated for entertainment purposes, with Mahomes Sr. standing to earn a minimum of $85,000 for his participation before the event was scrapped.Dave Portnoy weighed in on the cancellation during an episode of The Unnamed Show podcast, stating that Patrick Mahomes and Brittany played a pivotal role in putting a stop to the bout. According to Portnoy, “Mahomes' agent and Brittany – from what I am told – intervened and were like, ‘There's no way this fight’s happening. We’re going to cut this guy off if he does it.’”Neither Patrick nor Brittany Mahomes have responded to Rocker’s outburst. Instead, Brittany has been focused on family, recently sharing heartwarming photos from a Disney vacation with their three children—Sterling, Bronze, and Golden Raye.As the Chiefs look ahead to the 2025 NFL season, Mahomes is coming off a strong campaign with 3,928 passing yards and 26 touchdowns. Despite finishing the season with a 17-3 record, Kansas City fell short in Super Bowl LIX, losing to the Philadelphia Eagles.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes called ‘biggest loser’ as the Chiefs' face major issues on offensive line after Joe Thuney trade This latest clash between Rocker and the Mahomes family adds a bizarre offseason twist to the NFL drama, one that continues to blur the line between sports and spectacle.","Former MLB pitcher John Rocker is once again in the spotlight, this time for launching a scathing attack on Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany Mahomes.

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings produced an outstanding bowling effort, which laid the foundation for their five-wicket triumph over the Royal Challengers Bengaluru in a rain-affected IPL encounter.The match was reduced to 14 overs per side due to a rain delay, and the Royal Challengers Bengaluru could only muster a paltry total of 95 for 9.Tim David's unbeaten 50 off 26 balls accounted for more than 50% of RCB's inadequate score.Despite facing initial hiccups, the Punjab Kings chased down the target in 12.1 overs, scoring 98 for 5, and extending RCB's winless streak at home this season.The Kings' hard-hitting openers, Priyansh Arya and Prabhsimran Singh, struggled initially on a pitch that offered considerable bounce to the pacers.Arya, known for his ability to hit through the line, misjudged the conditions and skied a mistimed shot off Josh Hazlewood to David.Prabhsimran fell to Bhuvneshwar Kumar, and the Kings were jolted further when the in-form captain Shreyas Iyer was dismissed, edging Hazlewood to the wicketkeeper.With the score at 53 for 4, the Kings found themselves in a precarious position, but Nehal Wadhera's composed innings of 33 not out off 19 balls, including a couple of sixes off Suyash Sharma, steadied the ship.Wadhera's calm approach played a crucial role as the Punjab Kings eventually crossed the line, boosting their tally to 10 points and moving up to second place on the points table behind the leaders Delhi Capitals.Earlier, the Kings' clever bowling restricted RCB to a disappointing total after Shreyas opted to bowl first. The decision proved fruitful as the bowlers claimed three wickets in the powerplay.Phil Salt perished in the first over, trying to hit Arshdeep Singh out of the park, while Virat Kohli and Liam Livingstone also departed without making a significant impact.Yuzvendra Chahal, making his return to his former IPL home ground, Chinnaswamy Stadium, had a memorable outing, claiming the wicket of Jitesh Sharma. Rajat Patidar played some handsome shots, including a six off Bartlett, but RCB suffered a setback when Patidar (23 off 18) was dismissed by Chahal's tossed-up delivery.Marco Jansen (2/10) used short-pitched balls effectively, dismissing Krunal Pandya and Manoj Bhandage, as the RCB innings unravelled.Despite a few big blows by Player of the Match Tim David, including three consecutive sixes off Harpreet Brar, who also claimed two wickets, RCB's total proved insufficient against the Kings' disciplined bowling effort.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru could only muster a paltry 95 for 9. Tim David's unbeaten 50 off 26 balls accounted for more than 50% of RCB's inadequate score.

“I think we have a great team. We have guys who are willing to go to war. Everybody is staying together, the chemistry is high. So I think we, for sure, have a chance.”

has been determined to win the Championship title, and he has been highly vocal regarding this in a recent interview. Thehave entered the 2025 NBA playoffs as the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference, setting up a first-round matchup against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Central to the Los Angeles Lakers’ renewed championship aspirations is their superstar acquisition, Luka Doncic, who has dramatically transformed the team since joining midseason.Since Luka Doncic’s arrival, the Los Angeles Lakers have posted an 18-10 record when he’s on the court, a 64.2% winning percentage that underscores his immediate impact. Averaging 28.2 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 7.5 assists per game in 28 outings with Los Angeles, Doncic has brought elite-level production and playmaking to a team that had been searching for a consistent offensive leader.Luka Doncic recently showed confidence in his team by saying,His presence alongside LeBron James and rising star Austin Reaves has created a potent trio, bolstered by a solid supporting cast and high team chemistry. Luka Doncic’s playoff pedigree is well established. Just last year, he led the Dallas Mavericks to the NBA Finals despite battling significant injuries, showcasing his ability to elevate his game under pressure. Now healthier and more integrated with the Los Angeles Lakers, Doncic is eager to embrace the challenges of postseason basketball with his new team. He has expressed confidence in the Lakers’ championship potential, emphasizing the team’s unity and willingness to “go to war” together. His career playoff scoring average of 30.9 points per game ranks second only to Michael Jordan, highlighting his capacity to deliver in critical moments.The upcoming series against the Timberwolves promises to be a compelling battle, especially with Doncic’s anticipated matchup against Rudy Gobert, a defensive stalwart and multiple-time Defensive Player of the Year. Doncic thrives in pick-and-roll situations and relishes the opportunity to test his skills against Gobert, which could prove decisive in the series.Despite some skepticism from outside voices, including former champions predicting a disappointing playoff run, the Los Angeles Lakers and their fans are buoyed by the optimism of their star player and coaching staff. Head coach JJ Redick has voiced strong confidence in Doncic’s abilities, noting that no defender can truly contain him. The Lakers’ recent form—19-12 since Doncic’s arrival—combined with the veteran leadership of LeBron James and the dynamic scoring of Doncic, positions them as a formidable contender.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers in Trouble?

In sum, the Lakers’ 2025 playoff outlook is bright, fueled by Luka Doncic’s exceptional talent and the team’s cohesive chemistry. While the path to the championship will be challenging, the blend of experience, skill, and hunger for success makes the Los Angeles Lakers a legitimate threat to claim their 18th NBA title this season.

From gridiron greatness to emotional vulnerability



When public image collides with private battles



Even the most successful athletes face challenges that stats and accolades can’t capture—and Tom Brady is no exception. Widely regarded as the greatest quarterback in NFL history , Brady's legendary career boasts an unmatched seven Super Bowl titles, yet behind the shine of championship rings lies a more vulnerable, human side he’s beginning to share with the world.For two decades, Tom Brady maintained a laser focus on football, becoming the ultimate symbol of discipline and competitive excellence. But recently, the 46-year-old has revealed glimpses of his personal struggles, particularly in the wake of his divorce from supermodel Gisele Bündchen . Brady, who is usually tight-lipped about his private life, opened up about the emotional toll of navigating heartbreak, admitting he’s dealt with moments of “willful blindness.”This phrase—suggesting a conscious decision to ignore uncomfortable truths—points to the complexities Tom Brady faced in his marriage’s unraveling. While he didn’t name names, the context was unmistakable, especially given recent headlines surrounding Bündchen's ongoing relationship with her jiu-jitsu trainer, who is now widely rumored to be her partner and the father figure in her children’s lives.“Willful blindness” is not just a phrase—it’s a powerful acknowledgment of emotional compromise. Brady’s reflection reveals the cost of chasing perfection on the field while personal issues simmer in the background. The quarterback, once seemingly invincible both in his career and family life, now speaks like someone reckoning with the pain of being left behind. For fans, it’s a rare and raw admission: the GOAT is still just a man.The emotional fallout of watching Bündchen move on publicly is undoubtedly difficult for someone so accustomed to control and success. Reports of her being seen with her new partner and children add emotional weight to Brady’s recent comments, suggesting a sense of betrayal or at least loss.Also Read: Fresh discussion on Tom Brady and Gisele’s Bündchen’s marriage reignites debate over missed red flags Tom Brady’s recent openness signals a shift—not just for him but for the culture surrounding sports icons. His words serve as a reminder that personal pain doesn't discriminate by fame or fortune. As he transitions into the next chapter of his life, his legacy will now also include emotional authenticity—proof that true greatness isn't only measured by rings, but by the willingness to confront what hurts behind closed doors.","Tom Brady has revealed glimpses of his personal struggles, particularly in the wake of his divorce from supermodel Gisele Bündchen.

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings registered a five-wicket victory over Royal Challengers Bengaluru in a rain-curtailed Indian Premier League match on Friday. With this win, PBKS climbed to second place on the points table with 10 points, having won five out of their seven matches so far.Batting first in the 14-overs-per-side contest — shortened due to evening showers — RCB posted 95 for nine. Tim David led the charge with a counter-attacking 50 off just 26 balls. However, the rest of the RCB batting lineup struggled to get going.In reply, Punjab chased down the target with ease, reaching 96 in 12.1 overs. Nehal Wadhera played a crucial hand with a brisk 33 off 19 deliveries. Despite a commendable spell from Josh Hazlewood, who finished with figures of 3/14, RCB couldn’t stop the Punjab batters from cruising to victory.After the match, PBKS skipper Shreyas Iyer praised his team’s adaptability and instinctive decision-making under pressure.""As they say variety is the spice of life. We are able to experience all kinds of games over here. It is a great challenge. There was no thinking to be honest. I was making instinctive moves and obviously we were getting wickets. I didn't want the new batsman to come in and settle straightaway. Marco was able to extract little bit of bounce on this wicket. He was bowling lethal. He basically steadied the ship. And the rest of the bowlers they helped him. To be honest, we didn't know how the wicket was going to play and I personally feel the bowlers they adapted according to it,"" Iyer said after Punjab Kings win.""When I had a chat with Arshdeep, he said, the hard length balls were very difficult to hit on this wicket because I didn't see a single six off a fats bowler hit down the ground. That was the chatter going around and they were fantastic in executing it. Yes absolutely, you need one batsman to take the charge. Nehal was brilliant in his approach today. The attitude was top notch. I hope he continues the same form.""Personally I had a chat with Chahal. I told him you are a match winner and you need to get us wickets as much as possible. You don't need to be safe in your appraoch and he has got the capability of bouncing back. That's what we appreciate of him as a leggie. Probably he is the best bowler in the IPL so far. You to back that all the time.

Ohtani and his wife Mamiko are expecting their first child. Team manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the leaves, while Eddie Rosario has been stepped up to fill the active roster spot.The Los Angeles Dodgers’ Manager Dave Roberts, had informed the reporters, right before the Dodgers' series opener on Friday night against the Texas Rangers, that Dodgers’ wife, Shohei Ohtani was with his wife, Mamiko and he’ll be going on MLB's paternity list. He said:.""Shohei Ohtani had shared the news of Mamiko’s pregnancy on Instagram in late December. Mamiko is a former professional basketball player from Japan. In the post he wrote:The cute photo included Ohtani’s adorable dog, Decoy, along with a pink onesie, with blue baby shoes and a sonogram.As per MLB rules, Ohtani can miss up to three games while he’s on paternity leave.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

’s return to theroster is undoubtedly a sigh of relief for the team as the standout star previously left everyone concerned after his blood clot diagnosis. As Lillard made his return, he shared his horrid experience following the health scare, revealing in a candid admission, Lillard said that the diagnosis left him in a panicking state.Milwaukee Bucks star Damian Lillard is on the verge of returning to the court after a harrowing health scare that shook his world off the court. Lillard, diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right calf last month, made his first public comments on April 18, just ahead of the team’s playoff opener against the Indiana Pacers.The seven-time All-NBA guard revealed that basketball wasn’t his first concern after the diagnosis. “Obviously that’s a thing that can affect your life,"" Lillard said. ""I’ve got kids. I’ve got a big family. I’m tight with my family. So automatically I start thinking about what it could mean for me personally, so that was the scariest part.""The diagnosis came shortly after Lillard was sidelined on March 20 with what was initially believed to be calf soreness. But the swelling and discomfort didn’t sit right with him. “My leg just felt swollen,” he recalled. “It was like super tight… I was just like ‘This ain’t normal.’ We went from there.”Medical tests revealed a blood clot, which quickly shifted the focus from basketball to survival. Lillard began blood-thinning medication immediately and did not travel with the team during their next few games. “I mean, just looking at the time that I spent just not playing and the millions of thoughts that went through my head like man, what if this, what if that, I was panicking,” he said. “My back randomly started hurting, my chest started hurting and I’m like man, is it moving? I’m thinking all kind of stuff.”Doctors monitored Lillard closely with weekly ultrasounds and lab work, which allowed them to track his progress inch-by-inch. The results were surprising even to specialists. “They were just like, 'We don’t see this,'” Lillard said. “Then it just reached a point where it just got a lot smaller out of nowhere.”By mid-April, he was off medication and cleared for full basketball activity. Head coach Doc Rivers praised Lillard’s mindset during recovery. “He just kept saying, ‘I’m going to get through this.’ The energy of positive thinking, there may be something there.”As for his first playoff game, Lillard says he’s close. “The moment that I feel I can go, I’m going to go,” he said.“You never know when something could come up and change your life,” he reflected. “You just can’t take days and opportunities and things in your life for granted.”Also Read: Gregg Popovich health update: Fan favorite San Antonio Spurs coach suffers scare in restaurant For Bucks, Lillard’s return would be a huge advantage as the superstar would aid dominant Giannis Antetokounmpo in the upcoming games.","Milwaukee Bucks star Damian Lillard was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right calf last month.

'Our never-give-up attitude won us the game': Nehal Wadhera

In what was an evening for the bowlers, it was a batter whose resolute display made the difference in the end at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium . All of Arshdeep Singh, Marco Jansen, Yuzvendra Chahal and Harpreet Brar took two wickets for Punjab Kings . In the second essay, Josh Hazlewood picked three while Bhuvneshwar Kumar took two wickets.But it was Nehal Wadhera 's unbeaten 33 from 19 balls that made the difference as PBKS beat Royal Challengers Bengaluru and inflicted the third home defeat on the Rajat Patidar-led side.There were valuable runs in the first innings too. Tim David , the Player of the Match, struck an unbeaten fifty, his first in the IPL , as RCB reached a respectable 95/9 in the rain-affected match that was reduced to 14 overs.But Wadhera's tide-turning show, hitting three fours and three sixes, came against the run of play. As Hazlewood breathed fire and took two wickets in an over, PBKS desperately needed someone to stand up and face the onslaught.The 24-year-old left-hander pummelled leg-spinner Suyash Sharma for a couple of sixes to allay his team's worries.A composed Wadhera played a big hand as Punjab Kings eventually crossed the line, swelling their tally to 10 points to move up to second place on the points table behind leaders Delhi Capitals.The job was half done by the PBKS in the first innings. Clever bowling restricted RCB to a disappointing total after Shreyas Iyer opted to bowl first.The decision proved right as his bowlers plucked three wickets in the power play segment.Phil Salt perished in the first over itself, trying to hammer Arshdeep Singh (2/23) out of the park and stumper Inglis completed a good catch.Virat Kohli did not last long either, as Marco Jansen peddled 20 metres back to pull off a terrific catch off Arshdeep.The Royal Challengers' power play phase score read a sorry 26 for three as Liam Livngstone too departed without making any effect.Yuzvendra Chahal (2/11) made his return to his one-time IPL home Chinnaswamy Stadium memorable with the wicket of Jitesh Sharma.Amidst the ruins around him, skipper Rajat Patidar played some handsome shots, and none better than a pick-up off his pads off Bartlett that soared over mid-wicket for a six.But RCB soon received a body blow as Patidar (23, 18b) could not clear Bartlett at sweeper cover off Chahal, who teased the batters with those tossed up, fuller deliveries.Jansen (2/10), who used short-pitched balls to good effect, had his own moments as he jettisoned Krunal Pandya and Impact Sub Manoj Bhandage as RCB innings unravelled.It was despite a few big blows by Player of the Match David that included three sixes in a row off left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar, who also had a share in RCB's spoils with two wickets.","Punjab Kings beat Royal Challengers Bengaluru in IPL 2025. Nehal Wadhera's unbeaten 33 from 19 balls made the difference. Tim David struck an unbeaten fifty, his first in the IPL. RCB reached a respectable 95/9 in the rain-affected match.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120415472,imgsize-45804,width-400,resizemode-4/Nehal-Wadhera-RCB-PBKS.jpg"

Bombay Sport Exchange EP 3: Kane Williamson exclusive on NextGen cricketers to watch out for

NEW DELHI: ' Koi garden mein nahi ghoomega ’—a fiery on-field remark by Rohit Sharma during a Test match—took social media by storm earlier this year. The Indian skipper has now finally opened up about the story behind the viral line that quickly became a fan favourite.The incident took place during the second Test against England in Visakhapatnam in February 2024. Rohit was caught on the stump mic urging his teammates to show more urgency during a critical phase of the match. The phrase instantly struck a chord with fans and has been widely shared online ever since.Rohit has now explained the context of his now-famous words.“It was in Vizag, I saw the over ended and the players were leisurely walking as if they were in a garden. No one was running, there was no urgency in the field. I was fielding in the slip, we had spinners bowling from both ends. The game was hanging by a loose thread, it was an important game, we had to win. I had told the players in the morning that we need to put in some extra effort but they were having fun in the ground,” Rohit said on JioHotstar.He added that India desperately needed a breakthrough at that point, and he was frustrated with the lack of intensity.“So I saw it for two-three overs and then said things can't go on like this, you can't play cricket like this. Everyone was just going with the flow which annoyed me and then I told everyone not to be like that. A partnership was going on, I was desperate to get a wicket. In such moments everyone needs to put in a collective effort. At that moment, I saw everyone being busy with themselves which I didn't like,” he added.Meanwhile, Rohit’s recent form in the IPL continues to be a concern. On Thursday, Mumbai Indians skipper Hardik Pandya brought him in as an Impact Player against Sunrisers Hyderabad, but the veteran batter’s struggles persisted. He managed just 26 runs before falling to Pat Cummins.So far, Rohit has scored only 82 runs in six innings at a disappointing average of 13.66.The lean patch has drawn sharp criticism from former India opener Virender Sehwag, who has not held back in his assessment. Sehwag cautioned Rohit to safeguard his legacy and even suggested that it might be time for the former MI captain to consider stepping away from the format.",Rohit Sharma's 'Koi garden mein nahi ghoomega' comment took social media by storm.

NEW DELHI: New Zealand’s batting icon Kane Williamson shared his vision for the next era of cricketing greatness during an exclusive conversation with senior journalist K. Shriniwas Rao on TimesofIndia.com's latest episode of Bombay Sport Exchange When asked to name his “next Fab Four,” Williamson chuckled and replied, ""The five players that come to mind would be Yashasvi Jaiswal (India), Shubman Gill (India), Rachin Ravindra (New Zealand), Harry Brook (England) and Cameron Green from Australia.""Also See: MI vs SRH Coming from a player who is himself part of the modern ""Fab Four"" alongside Virat Kohli Steve Smith , and Joe Root, this endorsement carries tremendous weight.With over 9,276 Test runs at an average of 54.9, including 33 centuries, Williamson’s words reflect not just respect but a keen eye for future legends.The young Indian opener is enjoying a meteoric rise in the longer format, having already scored 1,798 runs in 19 Tests at an average of 52.9, including 4 centuries.His calm temperament and aggressive shot-making have made him a force at the top of the order.He was also part of India’s T20 World Cup-winning team, showing his growing presence in white-ball cricket, although he is yet to make his ODI debut.Gill’s classical style and adaptability have seen him become a regular in all three formats.In Tests, he has scored 1,893 runs in 32 matches with 5 centuries, averaging 35.While he hasn't quite replicated his white-ball dominance in the Test arena, he is widely regarded as the future captain of India's white-ball sides, thanks to his maturity and consistency in ODIs and T20Is.One of the most consistent and dependable new faces in the New Zealand setup, Rachin has been a key figure across all formats.In Tests, he’s scored 1,057 runs in 15 matches, averaging 37.8, with 2 centuries, including a career-best 240.His ability to slot into any role and contribute with both bat and ball makes him an all-format asset for the Kiwis.Harry Brook has been a revelation in red-ball cricket for England.In just 24 Tests, he has amassed 2,281 runs at a stunning average of 58.5, with 8 centuries and a high score of 317.His explosive style and aggression align perfectly with England’s ""Bazball"" strategy.Recognizing his potential as a leader and limited-overs performer, Brook has now been appointed England’s white-ball captain, marking a new chapter in his career.Despite battling recent injuries, Cameron Green remains a crucial all-rounder for Australia, offering balance with both bat and ball.In Tests, he’s scored 1,377 runs in 28 matches at an average of 36.2, with 2 centuries and a top score of 174*.His 13 sixes and 152 fours reflect his ability to shift gears, and when fully fit, Green is a game-changer in all three formats.Williamson’s nod to these five reflects both current performance and future potential.As the ""Fab Four"" era edges toward its twilight, this ""Fab Five"" could well be the torchbearers of the next golden generation of Test cricket.","Kane Williamson names five players to watch out for in next generation of cricketers.

Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) spinner Varun Chakravarthy has raised questions over a controversial ""no-ball"" call during the Mumbai Indians vs Sunrisers Hyderabad match at the Wankhede Stadium on Thursday.In the seventh over of the match, Mumbai Indians opener Ryan Rickelton was dismissed by leg-spinner Zeeshan Ansari, with Pat Cummins taking an easy catch at cover.However, the drama unfolded when the fourth umpire stopped Rickelton near the boundary rope, and the delivery was called a no-ball.The third umpire found that wicketkeeper Heinrich Klaasen had his gloves in front of the stumps when the ball made contact with the bat. Rickelton received a free-hit, but he failed to capitalize on it.The third umpire's decision was not appreciated by Varun Chakravarthy.""If the keeper's gloves come in front of the stumps, it should be a dead ball and a warning to the keeper so that he doesn't do that again!!! Not a no-ball and a free hit!! What did the bowler do? Thinking out loud!! What do you all think???"" he wrote on X.However, Rickelton was dismissed in the next over as Harshal Patel deceived him with a slower delivery. He scored 31 off 23 balls.Mumbai Indians defeated Sunrisers Hyderabad by six wickets with eleven balls to spare.Earlier, Sunrisers, who had successfully chased 246 in their previous match against Punjab Kings at home, failed to get going and ended up with a below-par score of 162/5.Sunrisers' next opponent will be Mumbai again on April 23 in Hyderabad.

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma 's scores in the ongoing Indian Premier League season read: 0, 8, 13, 17, 18, and 28. The Mumbai Indians stalwart, who has led the franchise to five IPL titles, is currently enduring a rough patch with the bat.On Thursday, skipper Hardik Pandya brought Rohit in as an Impact Player against Sunrisers Hyderabad , but the veteran batter’s struggles continued. He managed just 26 runs before being dismissed by Pat Cummins.In six innings so far, Rohit has scored only 82 runs at a disappointing average of 13.66.His lean run has drawn sharp criticism from former India opener Virender Sehwag , who didn’t mince words. Sehwag cautioned Rohit about protecting his legacy and even suggested that it might be time for him to consider stepping away from the format.“If you look at Rohit's IPL numbers in the last 10 years, he scored more than 400 runs only once. So he is not the kind of player who thinks that I need to score 500 or 700 runs. If he thinks, he might. When he became the Indian captain, he said that he wanted to be the player who wants to cash in on the powerplay and take the chances, so he wanted to make all the sacrifices alone, but he is not considering the fact that at the end of the day when he is not performing, it is your legacy that is getting hurt,"" Sehwag told Cricbuzz.""Ab uska jaane ka time aa gaya, (It's already time for him to retire), and before retiring, you would want to give fans something to remember you by, and not moments that force them to think, why are they not dropping him,” he said.“Take 10 balls extra, but at least play and give yourself a chance. He has been getting out to that pull shot many times against the back of the length deliveries. So he should decide that in one innings he will not play the pull shot at all. But who will explain it to him? There should be someone telling him to play normal cricket. When I was there, Sachin, Dravid or Ganguly used to tell me to play normal cricket,” he added.A disciplined performance from the bowling unit, spearheaded by Jasprit Bumrah and captain Hardik Pandya, powered Mumbai Indians to a four-wicket win over Sunrisers Hyderabad in a low-scoring clash at the Wankhede Stadium.Will Jacks emerged as the standout performer for Mumbai, picking up two key wickets and contributing a crucial 36 with the bat to steer the team to their second consecutive victory in IPL 2025 .This marked Mumbai Indians’ third win of the season, taking their tally to six points and lifting them to seventh place in the standings—breaking free from the congestion of teams stuck at four points near the bottom.

Rajat Patidar-led Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) will lock horns against Shreyas Iyer's Punjab Kings (PBKS) in Match No. 34 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Friday. RCB are currently placed at the third position, whereas Punjab are at fourth.As a team, Punjab will be high on confidence after their 16-run win over KKR in a recent low-scoring thriller. But they will be well aware that RCB, which has depth in batting and bowling, will be a harder opponent to overcome.Two former RCB players, Yuzvendra Chahal and Glenn Maxwell, will have noticed Bengaluru batters' struggle against slow bowlers R Sai Kishore, Kuldeep Yadav, and Vipraj Nigam in Bengaluru. RCB mentor Dinesh Karthik mentioned after their loss against Delhi Capitals that the Chinnaswamy pitch was surprisingly on the slower side, and both Chahal and Maxwell will be eager to exploit that.Chahal, fresh from his four-wicket haul against Kolkata Knight Riders, is a master of lengths rather than of ""magic balls."" The leg-spinner lures with offerings wide of off-stump, and the batters need to reach out to the ball for big hits, often resulting in catches in the deep.After RCB's consecutive losses, Dinesh Karthik hinted that the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium pitch has not delivered what the team management desires. “In the first two games, we have asked for good pitches. But it’s turned out in this way where it’s been challenging to bat on for sure. So we try and do the best with whatever we get,"" Karthik had said. “This is not a pitch that’s helping the batters too much. It’s a challenging pitch. That has been the case in both the games that we have played."" The Chinnaswamy Stadium pitch has historically been a batter's paradise, but in this year's IPL, it has been a bit tricky. When asked if the RCB team management will follow up with the curator, Karthik replied, “We will obviously have a chat with him, and we trust him to do his job.”Phil Salt, Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar (c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash DayalSuyash SharmaPriyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, Shreyas Iyer (c), Josh Inglis (wk), Nehal Wadhera, Glenn Maxwell, Shashank Singh, Marco Jansen, Xavier Bartlett, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra ChahalYash Thakur331617The forecast for Friday indicates that the sky will be mostly clear.
