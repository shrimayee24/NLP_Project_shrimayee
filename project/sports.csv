The environment might not have been good. I am not at all surprised that he will feel slightly relaxed and relieved after donning India's and not the Mumbai Indians ' blues.

NEW DELHI: The Norway Chess tournament witnessed significant shifts in standings as Magnus Carlsen solidified his lead while Indian players R Praggnanandhaa and R Vaishali faced setbacks in their respective sections.Carlsen, the world number one, capitalized on a blunder by Ding Liren to secure a victory, propelling him to the top with 12 points. This win was further bolstered by Fabiano Caruana 's victory over Hikaru Nakamura , leaving Nakamura trailing Carlsen by a single point. Ding Liren, the reigning World Champion, continues to struggle, sitting at a distant last place with a meager 2.5 points.Praggnanandhaa, after a hard-fought draw in the Classical game, lost to Firouzja Alireza in the Armageddon tiebreaker. This defeat places him third with 9.5 points, still within striking distance of the leaders.In the women's section, Vaishali suffered a loss against the reigning Women's World Champion, Wenjun Ju, who expertly navigated the endgame to secure victory. This loss allowed Wenjun to share the lead with Anna Muzychuk, who won her match against Tingjie Lei in Armageddon. Both leaders stand at 10.5 points, a mere half point ahead of Vaishali.The tournament, with four rounds remaining in both sections, promises further excitement. Carlsen appears poised for victory, but with Nakamura close behind, the fight for the title remains open. Praggnanandhaaa, despite the recent setback, still has the opportunity to climb the ranks. Similarly, Vaishali will be aiming to bounce back and reclaim the top spot in the women's section.The tournament has also sparked discussions about the upcoming World Championship match.

Pakistan

's white-ball coach, another interesting challenge awaits him

Man-of-the-tournament in the 2011 World Cup Yuvraj Singh labels him the best coach he's ever played under. Other members of that victorious campaign like Suresh Raina and Harbhajan Singh also speak glowingly about his man management skills.Former South African opener Gary Kirsten holds a special place in the hearts of Indian cricket fans as Guru Gary for the calm way he operated in the background for three years (2008-2011) after a turbulent two-year phase under Greg Chappell.After a successful stint with Gujarat Titans in the IPL where he acted as mentor and batting coach, Kirsten will be plying his trade with Pakistan as the country's white-ball coach.India take on Pakistan on June 9 in the T20 World Cup in New York's Nassau County Ground and Kirsten, who will be in the green dug out, could be carrying some trade secrets about the Indian players which the Pakistan team can exploit.Or would he? Noted mental conditioning coach Paddy Upton, who worked with the Indian team as part of Kirsten's support staff doesn't think so. ""These days video analysis and data on all players is detailed and well known to all opponents. Most players in the world have a deep and personal insight into players from other teams which they gain from playing in various leagues around the world. Given this extensive and in-depth knowledge that's already out there, I don't think there is much 'insider advantage' that Kirsten can bring to the India v Pak clash,"" Upton told TOI.Kirsten also worked closely with video analyst Prasanna Agoram for South Africa from 2011 to 2013 and with Delhi Daredevils from 2014 to 2015 and for Agoram it is Kirsten's man management skills that stand out.""He is a process-driven coach, not a coach who relies much on matchups and too much confusing data. Unless the performance of a player is coming down drastically, he will just focus on the process driven things where he keeps all boxes ticked. Only if a player is failing for two or three months while making the same mistake, does he step in after seeing the footage and data that I would have given him. But he is someone who builds strong relationships with players,"" Agoram told TOI.Kirsten is also good at avoiding aimless practice. An instance of that can be seen in the Adelaide Test of 2012 vs Australia that Agoram takes us back to.""He chose the playing XI and used to change the 12th man every day. The 14th and 15th member of the squad had the option of coming to the ground, go out, or just relax in the hotel.""Dashing former Indian opener Virender Sehwag , who enjoyed a productive second wind to his career under Kirsten, had alluded to this in a chat with reporters about how Kirsten recognised how much practice each player needs.""The coach should know who needs how much practice. In this the best was Kirsten. He used to give me 50 balls in the nets. Rahul Dravid used to play 200. Sachin Tendulkar 300. Gautam Gambhir 400. After that he told us to go the hotel and relax,"" Sehwag had said.Kirsten though could also talk sternly. During the 2009 T20 World Cup, he told Yuvraj that at 41, he was fitter than the big-hitting left-hander. It struck a chord with the gifted player, and he set about making better off-field choices that culminated in a man-of-the-series performance in the 2011 World Cup.Referring to the ability of giving players tough love, Upton says, ""Gary prefers diplomacy over conflict. He brings a natural calm to the environment, but he is also sufficiently professional to have tough conversations when required. Even these, he has in his uniquely calm way. When it comes to challenging senior players, it's always important to first develop the trust and relationship."" So, what is the advantage that Kirsten will bring to Pakistan?""His experience of working in a foreign culture, and the awareness that goes with this. He will do a lot of listening and seek to understand. He will also understand the emotions and fanaticism of fans and the media. He will have developed something of a thick skin, which is very important in this type of environment,"" feels Upton.Agoram too highlights Kirsten's man management skills and his ability to invest time and energy in a player-coach relationship.""If he wants to tell Fakhar Zaman, who has opened all his life to bat at no.4, it boils down to trust. If a player trusts his coach, he will say, ""Ok, I am game."" Many times, when players are asked to change roles, they say we are not comfortable. But I am sure Gary's God fatherly love he gives players will help him in such situations. He is an extremely levelheaded coach and does not get excited by wins or disheartened by losses. I have never seen him get angry. Pakistan have made an excellent choice,"" Agoram stresses.Over to Babar's boys to prove this right.","India take on Pakistan in the T20 World Cup in New York on June 9. Gary Kirsten will be Pakistan's white-ball coach for the tournament. Former South African opener Kirsten is known as Guru Gary for his calm approach.

NEW DELHI: Co-hosts West Indies faced a tough challenge from a spirited Papua New Guinea side before securing a hard-fought five-wicket victory in their T20 World Cup opener in Georgetown on Sunday.Despite losing their first four wickets for just 50 runs, PNG managed to post a respectable total of 136 for eight, thanks to a gritty half-century from left-hander Sese Bau (50 off 43).The two-time champions, boasting a power-packed lineup, were expected to chase down the modest target with ease. However, PNG's spinners and medium pacers made the hosts work hard for their win on a slow surface.Roston Chase (42* off 27) and Andre Russell (15* off 9) provided a crucial rearguard action to guide the West Indies home in 19 overs.The West Indies' innings was briefly interrupted by a 20-minute rain delay, but no overs were lost.The passing shower arrived with the home team at 8 for one in the second over and they could have been two down at the same score had right-arm pacer Alei Nao won an lbw review against the dangerous Nicholas Pooran.Earlier, PNG's innings was in disarray at 50 for four before Bau shared a vital 44-run partnership with Charles Amini (12) to steady the ship.The West Indies, anticipating turn, selected three spinners and opted to field after winning the toss.The spinners found assistance from the pitch as early as the first over, bowled by Akeal Hosein.However, it was pacer Romario Shepherd who picked the first wicket by having Tony Ura caught behind in the second over of the game. The ball seamed away, inducing a thick edge from the batter.Hosein got rid of number three Lega Siaka with an arm ball before Alzarri Joseph sent back Vala (21 off 22 balls). Vala came up with a couple of crisp hits in the cover region before being caught brilliantly by Roston Chase at backward point.Vala's six over extra cover off spinner Chase in the previous over was one of the highlights of PNG's innings.Bau then ensured that the odd boundary kept coming as PNG tried to consolidate their innings.Bau, a leftie like Vala, smashed left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie for a six and couple of fours to give the innings much needed momentum.After his departure, the associate nation did rather well to get close to the 140-run mark.",West Indies beat Papua New Guinea by five wickets in their T20 World Cup opener. PNG posted 136-8 thanks to a gritty half-century from Sese Bau (50 off 43) Roston Chase (42* off 27) and Andre Russell (15* off 9) guided West Indies home.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110645434,imgsize-97218,width-400,resizemode-4/110645434.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The much-awaited first-round clash between archrivals India and Pakistan in the T20 World Cup is scheduled for June 9 at the 34,000-capacity newly-constructed Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York.India and Pakistan are favorites to make it to the Super 8 stage from Group A, which also includes Ireland.India have banked on experienced players such as captain Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli , perhaps playing for the last time in a T20 World Cup, to win back the title they won at the inaugural tournament in South Africa in 2007.Speaking on Saturday at the opening of the Blue Ocean Corporation-organized International Procurement and Supply Chain Conference in Mumbai, former Indian captain and former BCCI president Sourav Ganguly discussed his thoughts on the marquee clash.Ganguly stated that although India is better than Pakistan, the bitter rivals will present a formidable challenge in the Twenty20 format when the two teams play on June 9.""Our record against Pakistan has been very, very good over a long period of time. In the T20 format, probably Pakistan is more dangerous compared to 50-overs (format). We beat them in Ahmedabad when they came to India and we beat them easily.""India is superior and if they play well, if they play freely and I keep saying the word 'freely' all the time because (in) the last World Cup in Australia, I don't think we played freely,"" he said.""Just put all the cobwebs behind. Don't worry about winning or losing. Don't think about winning the World Cup. Just go and play every game,"" he added.On India's prospects, Ganguly said India has a strong possibility to win the T20 World Cup. The USA and the West Indies will co-host the event, and it starts on Saturday.""India have very good chances in the World Cup. India will have to play like a T20 team. There is enormous talent,"" he said.Ganguly also said India's chances are ""very good"" in the T20 World Cup but the team should play with ""freedom"".""...play without fear and just keep hitting. There is enormous talent, (this is) a team which has (Virat) Kohli, Rohit (Sharma), Surya (Suryakumar Yadav), (Rishabh) Pant, (Shivam) Dubey, (Hardik) Pandya, (Ravindra) Jadeja, Axar (Patel), (Jasprit) Bumrah, Sanju (Samson),"" he said when asked about India's chances.""That's why I say everyone is capable of winning it for India and the only way they will do it is (if they) just play with freedom.""Play with that extra batsman and hit from the first ball, hit till you have to defend (and) play like the last ball,"" he added.Ganguly supported Rohit and Kohli as the Indian opening duo.""It is Virat and Rohit, both should open. Virat has been in tremendous touch in the IPL , he is a great player,"" he said.The former opener claimed that the drop-in pitches used in the USA World Cup leg, which were brought in from Adelaide, should be batting-friendly.""I am very keen to see how the conditions are in the US.

as the new

captain, needs to put his recent travails behind him & rise to the occasion in the

T20 World Cup

...

In the World Cup, will Hardik Pandya find himself on the crest or in the trough of his rollercoaster career? The Pandya situation is no doubt being handled with utmost care in the Team India camp right now. Coach Rahul Dravid and captain Rohit Sharma will be eager to get the best out of one of India's most important T20 contributors and the only true seam-bowling allrounder in the ranks.Pandya is also vice-captain of the team, another appointment dogged by controversy and mired in innuendo, like everything else with the cricketer lately. It's not Pandya's credentials that are under the scanner. He has been retained in Grade A in the BCCI 's central contracts list in spite of recurring injuries since 2018. Having played only in the IPL following an ankle injury during the ODI World Cup late last year, the entire focus should have been on the cricketer's quest to regain peak fitness in time for the big one.Instead, his world seems to be unravelling around him.Both Pandya's private life and public persona have come under such intense scrutiny in recent times that often, from the outside, it has seemed things are at breaking point. It's a curious turn of events for one of the most colourful, exciting and emotional cricketers India has ever produced, one who possesses both rare skill and naked ambition.Since he burst on to the scene for Mumbai Indians in 2015, Pandya has not shied away from showcasing the kind of swagger that can attract the wrong kind of attention. People may scoff at his extravagant ways but having seen some real hard times growing up, Pandya is entitled to live it up if he wants to. He has chosen to be all flash and glitter. He has lived life on his terms.At times that has got him into trouble too, like when he was suspended for some ill-conceived comments on a TV talk show. This recent implosion in the Mumbai Indians camp and the hostility of spectators, however, has been particularly unsettling to watch. Fans across venues have raged against Pandya and rained slurs on him. They seemed incensed by Pandya's switch from Gujarat Titans and the dethroning of the more popular Rohit Sharma as Mumbai Indians captain.Then again, the trigger may well be Hardik's loud public persona.Either way you see it, this public castigation of Pandya across stadiums has showcased the worst of the IPL's oddball fan-loyalties at play.It could also be the management's choice to overlook the optics altogether. CSK, after all, underwent a similar transition and there wasn't a peep from the crowds. Cricketers routinely switch club loyalties in the auction process and there is no outcry. To the fans, the MI captaincy swap may have seemed like a midnight coup.The appointment as MI captain seemed plagued with trouble from the start. The likes of Suryakumar Yadav and Jasprit Bumrah - among four players from the MI setup in the World Cup squad - have seemingly, in cryptic social-media posts, expressed displeasure at being overlooked. It seemed even Rohit Sharma, having been named India's captain for the T20 World Cup in a surprise return to the old guard, had been caught unawares.Many ex-cricketers thought Pandya was faking and blustering his way through the doomed campaign, that his leadership style was muddled. Kevin Pietersen said Pandya was ""smiling too much"" and ""trying to act like he's happy"" when ""everything away from the game was affecting him so much"". Graeme Smith said MI have been a ""very confused team"".Pandya may have thought he was the most hated Indian cricketer ever. There may have been moments when he lost direction.After a loss to CSK, Pandya alluded to Dhoni's presence in the opposition and said, ""There's a man behind the stumps who tells them what's working."" This spurred Adam Gilchrist to say, ""That line about Dhoni is interesting. It tells that maybe Pandya is feeling a bit of a lone wolf.""AB de Villiers said he loved Pandya but ""his captaincy style is quite bravado. It's ego-driven, chest out"".Perhaps Pandya was too abrasive for Mumbai Indians, even though the style may have worked at Gujarat Titans. The public criticism of Tilak Varma for not taking on DC's Axar Patel and whispers of an alleged dressing room showdown did not help either. MI coach Mark Boucher admitted in the end that all the happenings may have ""clouded"" Pandya.All chief selector Ajit Agarkar would say about Pandya's selection is, ""The good part we have looked at is that he has got through all the games so far for MI.""That, however, doesn't answer the question - is Pandya in the best frame of mind to perform at his peak in a tournament like this? The relentless antagonism from spectators also spurred an ongoing social-media trial that puts him under immense pressure to perform in the World Cup.In one of his rare moments of candour, Pandya said, ""We've seen better days but seen worse days as well. I don't think these things surprise me anymore.""If there's one cricketer who swears by his resilience, it's Hardik Pandya. His first post after joining the India squad in the US contained the words: ""On national duty.""Remember, India have had alleged flare-ups between captain and vice-captain in a T20 World Cup before, back in 2009, when Dhoni paraded the whole team in front of the media to quell reports of a rift in the team.This time, the calming presence of both Rohit and Dravid may serve to erase any lingering bitterness. Team India needs Pandya to step up to win the World Cup. He was, after all, their best performer with the bat in that semifinal defeat to England in Adelaide in 2022.",Hardik Pandya's world seems to be unravelling around him.

Ronaldo, who joined Al-Nassr in December 2022, was visibly distraught, collapsing to the ground before being comforted by his teammates at King Abdullah Sports City.The disappointment came after the conclusion of the Saudi Pro League four days ago, where Al-Nassr finished second, trailing Al-Hilal by 14 points. Ronaldo's individual achievement of setting a new league record with 35 goals provided some solace, but it was not enough to offset the team's longing for the championship.The final match was marked by intensity, witnessing two goals and three red cards. Al-Hilal took an early lead with Aleksandar Mitrovic's header after just seven minutes. Al-Nassr suffered a setback in the second half when goalkeeper David Ospina was ejected for handling the ball outside the area.The drama escalated when Ali Al-Bulaihi of Al-Hilal was also sent off for a headbutt on Sami Al-Najei. Al-Nassr seized the opportunity, equalizing with Ayman Yahya's header moments later.As tensions soared, Al-Hilal's Kalidou Koulibaly received his second yellow card, reducing his team to ten men. After the stalemate in extra time, the fate of the match was decided by a penalty shootout.Although both teams missed their initial attempts, Ronaldo converted his penalty. However, Al-Hilal emerged victorious as Bounou saved crucial penalties from Ali Al-Hassan and Al-Nemer, securing their 11th King’s Cup title.For Ronaldo and his team, the wait for silverware continues into the next season.","Al-Nassr lost 5-4 on penalties to Al-Hilal in the King's Cup final in Jeddah.

NEW DELHI: Considered strong contenders for T20 World Cup 2024, West Indies narrowly escaped an upset in their opening match against Papua New Guinea (PNG), ultimately securing a five-wicket victory. Despite the win, West Indies captain Rovman Powell acknowledged his team's need for improvement across all facets of the game.PNG, exceeding pre-match expectations, delivered a commendable performance, challenging the favoured West Indies throughout the match.Sese Bau anchored the PNG innings with a well-constructed half-century, while Kiplin Doriga provided late impetus with a crucial unbeaten knock of 27 runs. Their contributions propelled PNG to a respectable total of 136/8.SEE ALSO: T20 World Cup Schedule The PNG bowlers, maintaining disciplined lines and lengths, made scoring difficult for the West Indies batsmen. They effectively defended their total, forcing the West Indies to work hard for every run.Powell acknowledged PNG's tactical acumen, stating, ""Credit has to be given to PNG. I think their plans were simple and they played good cricket.""He did, however, admit that his bowling unit could have restricted PNG to a lower score, adding, ""I think it (PNG's score of 136 for 8) is a little, 10 or 15, too much.

This venue hosted its first international fixture on Saturday, when India defeated Bangladesh by 60 runs in a warm-up game.In that match, India's seamers were particularly effective, claiming seven wickets among them.

Sometimes life puts you in situations where things are tough, but I believe that if you leave the game or the field, the battle that is, you won't get what you want from your sport, or the results you are looking for,"" Hardik said in an interview with Star Sports.""So, yeah, it has been difficult, but at the same time, I have been process-driven, I have tried to follow the same routines I used to follow earlier.""At the same time these things happen; there are good times and bad times, these are phases that come and go. That is fine. I have gone through these phases many times and I will come out of it as well.""""I don't take my successes too seriously. Whatever I have done well, I have forgotten about them immediately and moved forward. Same with difficult times,"" he said. ""I don't run away from it. I face everything with [my] chin up.The all-rounder said that his 16-year-old self is his biggest motivator and believes that while coming out of the bad phase, it all comes down to self-belief.""As they say, this too shall pass. So coming out [of these phases] is simple: just play the sport, accept that [you need to] maybe get better at your skillset, keep working hard - hard work never goes to waste - and keep smiling.""""I think it comes down to self-belief. I believe a lot in hard work. You can succeed only if you put in the effort for it. I want to give myself the opportunity to… why do I prepare and commit myself every time? The only reason is that while I am not guaranteed success, I am guaranteed an opportunity to be successful. I focus simply on how do I keep getting better. Speak to myself. Try to know my real version.""Hardik Pandya right now at 30 is a much, much easier job compared to what Hardik Pandya was when I was 16. So I go back to the 16-year-old and I ask him how did you do it, why did you do it? At that point of time, I didn't have facilities or opportunities. Hard work gave me opportunities and opened doors for me. So I am in that zone right now [where] I am going and asking the 16-year-old - because he is my actual motivator, because if that guy hadn't set the platform I probably wouldn't have been here.""In the T20 World Cup warm-up against Bangladesh on Saturday, Hardik showed glimpses of his return to form as he fired a solid 23-ball unbeaten 40.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan captain Babar Azam shared his thoughts on the team's performance in the last T20 World Cup. He believes that Pakistan had the potential to not only defeat their long-time rival, India, but also to secure the championship title.In the previous edition of the tournament, Pakistan found themselves just two victories away from clinching the coveted trophy for the first time since their inaugural win in 2009.However, their hopes were dashed when they faced Australia in the semi-final match. Despite their best efforts, the Men in Green suffered a narrow 5-wicket loss against the Baggy Greens.Looking back on the crucial encounter, Babar expressed his belief that the outcome could have been different if his team had managed to deliver a couple of dot deliveries in the final phase of the game.""I think the semi-final we lost against Australia, we could have won that. In that match, fielding was the reason that made a different impact. If we had bowled two or three dot balls in the final stages, then the pressure would have got to them. But we lost as a team and not due to an individual,"" Babar said in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) podcast.Pakistan showcased an exceptional performance throughout the 2022 tournament, reaching the final with an almost perfect record. However, their dismal streak against India in World Cup matches persisted as they faced a narrow four-wicket loss in the championship match.Pakistan had a commanding lead for most of the game against their rivals. With only eight balls remaining, India found themselves in a daunting position, requiring 28 runs to secure the win.""For me, in 2022 [World Cup], we could and should have won the India game, but they took it away,"" Babar noted.As Virat Kohli faced Haris Rauf, he retreated slightly before launching a colossal six directly over the Pakistani paceman's head. Amidst the intense atmosphere, commentator Gerard Whateley immortalized the moment with the unforgettable words: ""That is a shot of an emperor,"" encapsulating Kohli's brilliance.The subsequent delivery was dispatched for another six, setting the stage for India's successful pursuit of 160 runs. The encounter exceeded expectations, and spectators eagerly anticipate another thrilling contest.Pakistan secured a spot in the final, but their hopes were dampened when Shaheen Afridi , their star fast bowler, suffered an injury during the match against England, significantly contributing to their eventual defeat.""Shaheen's [Afridi] injury was impactful because, at that time, the pressure was on them [England]. We were forced to give an over to a spinner and that made a difference,"" he said while recalling the T20 World Cup 2022 loss against England in the final.Pakistan are placed in Group A and will begin their campaign against the co-hosts USA on June 6 at the Grand Prairie Stadium, Texas.",Babar Azam believes Pakistan had the potential to win T20 World Cup 2022.

NEW DELHI: During India's optional nets session at Cantiague Park, Long Island, on Friday, Rishabh Pant energetically practiced his reverse sweeps under the watchful eyes of batting coach Vikram Rathour and head coach Rahul Dravid , who were keenly assessing his aggressive stroke-play abilities.Pant's prowess was on full display during India's warm-up match against Bangladesh. Playing on a challenging drop-in pitch at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, the left-handed batter scored a fluent 53 runs off 32 balls before retiring out, marking the most significant takeaway from India's 60-run win in the warm-up game.Initially struggling after coming in at number three following Sanju Samson's dismissal, Pant managed just one run off his first six balls. However, he quickly accelerated, hitting three sixes off Shakib Al Hasan, including an audacious reverse-sweep.Pant showcased his versatility by stepping out against Mahedi Hasan and executing a one-handed swipe off Mahmudullah. He also targeted the inverted 'V' region, twice performing no-look flicks over short fine leg off Soumya Sarkar, utilizing his wrists and hands skillfully.In total, Pant hit four fours and as many sixes, demonstrating his proficiency against both spinners and pacers. This performance has made the Indian think-tank seriously consider including Pant in the playing eleven for the campaign opener against Ireland on June 5.""As a batter, he's got that ability to explore angles which a normal batter doesn't. He gets into different positions and is so strong that he can connect with the ball to hit sixes – one-handed, off-balance, or while falling – you name it, he's done it. He can bat at number three or four and can even be a finisher – a left-handed batter with so much power.""When he is set and going, there's no limit to what he can do; he's very, very destructive. During the IPL, people were targeting his stumps as everyone knew he would hit shots through point or cover if someone bowls outside the off-stump to him. So, he was using that angle and it was not like, he's leg-side dominant,"" says Biju George , the Delhi Capitals ' fielding coach, in a conversation with IANS on Pant's propensity to nail unorthodox shots with ease.This year's IPL marked Pant's highly anticipated return to cricket after nearly 15 months away due to multiple injuries sustained in a life-threatening car accident in December 2022, which included a right knee ligament reconstruction surgery performed in Mumbai.George, a former fielding coach for the India women's team, closely monitored Pant's recovery journey and finally met him during the Delhi Capitals' pre-season camp in Visakhapatnam. George believes that Pant is savoring every moment on the field and is back to his peak form, particularly in terms of fitness.""If you talk about just before that incident and now, he's become much better. He's leaner and fitter now. I first met him when he was around 19 or 20 at the NCA wicketkeepers' camp. The shape and fitness levels he had at that time, now it can be said he's at the same level, as also his skillset is supreme.""His mind is very, very strong and very focused on what he has to do on the field. He has now realised how fragile life can be and is now enjoying every moment of it. At the ground, he is ready to give every bit of himself towards every ball. Plus, he's so intense now while fielding, keeping and batting every ball.In addition to scoring 446 runs in 13 games for the Delhi Capitals in IPL 2024, Pant resumed his wicketkeeping duties from the start, demonstrating remarkable fluency with 11 catches and five stumpings. George admitted he was surprised when Pant took over as the wicketkeeper for the Delhi Capitals' campaign opener in Mullanpur in March.""I was really surprised as I never thought he would get up and keep wickets during initial phases of the IPL. Probably, the plan on discussing with the trainer was to field at mid-off or mid-on, where there is not much lateral movement.""Once he would get used to the load, he would start keeping, probably in second phase of the IPL. But I was surprised with the way he came good in keeping right from the first day, and his stumping of Jitesh Sharma at Mullanpur was amazing.As the season progressed, Pant became increasingly fluent in his skills, ultimately earning a spot in India's T20 World Cup squad. Although there were reports suggesting he might be named India's vice-captain for the tournament, this did not materialize. George noted how he observed Pant developing as a leader for the Delhi Capitals during IPL 2024.""He's literally one of the best cricketing minds you can come across. He's always thinking about angles; where to put a fielder and who would be the best person at a particular fielding position. He's also inspiring the bowlers, like he once said to someone like Ishant Sharma in a game, 'no paaji, you are good enough'.""He has got the best out of bowlers and is a captaincy material for sure. He's always around the players, telling them that they have the abilities to execute as per the demand of the situation, like 'come on, you can do it'. I call him one-man cheerleading arm,"" said George.George believes Pant will perform well in the T20 World Cup due to his quick adaptability. ""In IPL 2024, I felt there were couple of pitches which was very much like American conditions. So, I feel he will adapt well to the conditions in USA for the T20 World Cup, as he's shown his adaptive qualities previously, while succeeding at the Test level.""He's currently at his best now in terms of keeping. During IPL 2024, he would join for fielding drills, throw himself around and he would be enjoying himself there. In the World Cup, I feel he will win at least a few matches for India and really hope he lifts the trophy,"" he said.The clash against Punjab Kings in Mullanpur on March 23 marked Pant's return to competitive cricket action. The sight of him taking the field and pursuing his greatest love - of playing cricket again - reduced George to tears and left him feeling overwhelmed with emotion in the DC camp.The long-awaited opportunity to represent India again after the accident might finally come for Pant on June 5 against Ireland, a moment which will generate unforgettable elation among the spectators in the stadium.One would wish for Pant to continue from where he left off in the warm-up game against Bangladesh last Friday. ""I really love this guy and nobody thought it (him returning to elite cricket) was possible, but that day (at Mullanpur), magic panned out. So many people can draw inspiration from him.""People write you off, but from nowhere, you can come back to be at your best.

NEW DELHI: Italian defender Giorgio Scalvini has been ruled out of the upcoming European Championship after suffering a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee. The injury deals a significant blow to Italy 's defensive lineup and casts a shadow over their Euro 2024 campaign.The incident occurred during Atalanta's final Serie A match of the season against Fiorentina on Sunday. In the 84th minute, while attempting a tackle, the 20-year-old defender landed awkwardly and immediately signalled for medical attention. Visibly distressed, Scalvini was helped off the pitch by medical staff, unable to bear weight on his left leg.Initial tests conducted at a local hospital revealed a rupture of the ACL, a serious knee injury that typically requires surgery and a lengthy rehabilitation period. While further evaluation is scheduled in the coming days, the diagnosis effectively rules Scalvini out of contention for the European Championship.Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini confirmed the severity of the injury during the post-match press conference, saying, ""Let's hope it's not the worst thing, clearly the cruciate ligament. The dynamics of the injury aren't the best.""Scalvini's absence leaves a significant void in Italy's defensive lineup. The young defender was poised to be the youngest player in Luciano Spalletti 's squad and was considered a key prospect for the future of Italian football .His absence adds to the defensive woes of the Italian team, who are already grappling with the withdrawal of Inter Milan defender Francesco Acerbi due to a groin injury.Italian media reports suggest that Juventus defender Federico Gatti is the likely candidate to replace Scalvini in the squad. However, replacing the young defender's potential and versatility will be a significant challenge for Spalletti as he prepares his team for the tournament.Italy's Euro 2024 campaign kicks off on June 15 against Albania, followed by matches against Spain and Croatia.

Karim Adeyemi, Niclas Füllkrug, Julian Brandt, and Marcel Sabitzer all came close to breaking the deadlock, but Thibaut Courtois, in his fifth appearance of an injury-interrupted season, produced several crucial saves to keep Real Madrid level.Despite Dortmund's early pressure, Real Madrid remained composed and gradually grew into the game in the second half.

NEW DELHI: Borussia Dortmund coach Edin Terzic believes ""anything is possible"" as his team prepares to face the formidable Real Madrid in the Champions League final at London's Wembley Stadium on Saturday.Real Madrid enters the final as heavy favorites, aiming to secure their 15th European title and sixth in the last 11 seasons. They face a Dortmund side that has already defied expectations by reaching the final.Despite Real Madrid's dominance this season, having lost just twice in 54 games and clinched the La Liga title with a 10-point lead, they had to overcome significant challenges to reach the Champions League final, as described by coach Carlo Ancelotti .""We have to enjoy being here,"" said Ancelotti at his pre-match press conference. ""But knowing it can go wrong because we are close to the most important thing in football – winning a Champions League – but having the fear this can escape us.""Ancelotti's squad showcased resilience by overcoming defending champions Manchester City on penalties in the quarter-finals and staging a legendary late comeback against Bayern Munich in the semi-finals at the Santiago Bernabeu.""We never stop believing, no matter how the circumstances are,"" said Luka Modric . Along with Nacho, Dani Carvajal, and Toni Kroos—playing his final match for the club—Modric could win the European Cup for a record-equalling sixth time. ""We always believe, keep believing, keep pushing, fighting until the end. In the end, we manage to find a way to beat opponents. Many people say there is luck, but when it happens so many times, I think it's not just luck.""Borussia Dortmund faces the challenge of overcoming a significant financial gap with Real Madrid as they aim to secure their second Champions League title. Last season, Madrid boasted record revenues of 831 million euros ($901 million), while Dortmund's stood at 420 million euros, according to Deloitte.The trajectory of Jude Bellingham 's career underscores Dortmund's challenge. Initially signed from English Championship side Birmingham as a teenager, Bellingham was developed by Dortmund before being transferred to Madrid for over 100 million euros a year ago. Dortmund struggled in the Bundesliga this season, finishing fifth and trailing Bayer Leverkusen by 27 points.Despite these challenges, Terzic's team has excelled in the Champions League, reaching the final for the third time and the first since their defeat to Bayern Munich at Wembley 11 years ago. Dortmund emerged as the victors of a challenging group that included Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan, and Newcastle. They then defeated PSV Eindhoven and Atletico Madrid before a remarkable defensive effort secured a victory over PSG in the semi-finals.""They are the favourites but we don’t care,"" said Terzic. ""We haven’t been the favourites against Atletico or against PSG. But if we are brave and not here to watch Real Madrid lift the trophy, if we are here to give them a game, then we have a chance.""Despite Dortmund being allocated only 30,000 tickets for the 90,000-capacity stadium, over 100,000 fans are estimated to have traveled to London. UEFA will aim to keep the focus on the on-field action, hoping their choice of Wembley for the final won't be scrutinized. The Euro 2020 final saw violence as ticketless fans breached the stadium, prompting the English Football Association to invest £5 million ($6 million) in enhancing safety and infrastructure at Wembley.

As the team convened for training ahead of the crucial World Cup qualifier against Kuwait on June 6, which marks Chhetri's final international appearance, Sandhu expressed the responsibility lying on the players to fill the void left by the departing legend.During a media interaction at the National Centre of Excellence, Sandhu stated, ""The onus is on the players to take up the mantle. Eventually, this was going to happen, and we have to learn to cope without him (Chhetri). We have also experienced playing without Sunil Bhai in some matches in the past. It's not that we have done really badly; we need to manage things without him. New players need to show up and take the nation forward.""India notably secured a goal-less draw against formidable opponents Qatar, the two-time Asian Cup champions, in a 2022 World Cup qualifying round match in September 2019, when Chhetri was absent due to illness.Chhetri, with 94 goals from 150 matches spanning a remarkable 19-year career, currently ranks as the third leading active international goal scorer, behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi .Sandhu acknowledged the enormity of Chhetri's legacy, stating, ""In my personal opinion, it's impossible to replicate what Sunil Bhai has done in these years. But Sunil bhai has given us the blueprint, the map, and if you follow that you may not become the next Chhetri but can come close enough to his greatness.""India's journey in the World Cup qualifiers has seen highs and lows, starting with a historic 1-0 away victory over Kuwait, their first in over two decades.

This achievement would mark a significant milestone for Indian football , promising further challenges and opportunities on the international stage.Gurpreet reiterated the importance of maintaining normalcy and consistent preparation, expressing hope that Chhetri's winning goal against Kuwait would serve as a fitting farewell.""Everything is pretty normal, and we are keeping it that way.
