‘Don’t let Rambo die alone like Shankar’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-let-rambo-die-alone-like-shankar/articleshow/124017909.cms,"When 20-year-old Nikita Dhawan heard of Shankar’s death on Wednesday, it felt as if she had lost a close family member. For years, she had fought for the rescue of Delhi’s only African elephant, kept in solitary confinement at the city zoo.Now, she hopes Shankar’s passing will prevent a similar fate for Rambo, the only remaining African elephant in captivity at Mysuru Zoo.Dhawan first saw Shankar four years ago on a trip to Delhi Zoo with her parents, and felt something shift inside her. The elephant, one of two brought to India in 1998 as a diplomatic gift from Zimbabwe, stood alone, his feet bound with metallic chains. His companion had died in 2001, and since then, the elephant named after former Indian president Shankar Dayal Sharma lived in isolation — a cruel fate for a species known for their social nature and desire for companionship.“At that time, he was chained for 17 hours a day. He was also in the proximity of trains, which was very harmful to his ears. He was showing a lot of stressful behaviour,” she said.Dhawan, whose love for wildlife stemmed from the many trips she made with her parents to sanctuaries, decided to channel her heartbreak into action. She started a non-profit called Youth for Animals to mobilise support and help Shankar get out of the zoo.Soon, other young volunteers joined, filed RTIs and sent letters to the Delhi Zoo and the Prime Minister. They also gathered video evidence of his physical and mental state. In 2022, they officially filed a public interest litigation in Delhi high court.“An inspection report for Shankar was ordered, but it was not done by an independent third-party. So, we didn’t feel like the results accurately reflected his condition,” Dhawan says. It was decided that Shankar would be kept at the zoo. Then, in March 2023, the Supreme Court increased the jurisdiction and powers of a high-powered committee led by Justice (retd) Deepak Verma, to conduct necessary checks and fact-finding exercises concerning wild animals, including those in captivity, across India. That brought hope to Dhawan, and she focused on getting transfer options ready for Shankar.“We knew something had to be done urgently. Elephants are very social animals, and you can’t just rip them out of the wild and make them live on their own. For nearly 13 years, Shankar had no visual or oral communication, even with the other Asian elephants at the zoo,” says Dhawan.UK-based Aspinall Foundation, which runs multiple sanctuaries across Africa, agreed to shift the lonely elephant, and take care of the expenses too. However, the domestic authorities wanted to keep Shankar in India, Dhawan says. Hence, the search for a domestic alternative began. Last summer, she visited Vantara, the animal rescue arm of Reliance Foundation in Jamnagar, which expressed interest in housing Shankar alongside other African elephants. “We sent that option to the high-powered committee, but received no response,” she says.Meanwhile, pressure began to mount on the Delhi zoo authorities. In Oct 2024, the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums suspended its license over concerns about Shankar’s living conditions. The body asked the authorities to either improve the conditions or relocate him. However, before that could happen, Shankar passed away at the age of 29, years before the species’ average life expectancy of 70. An inquiry has been ordered into the cause of the death, while zoo officials claim that Shankar showed no signs of illness and the collapse was sudden. “I feel that the zoo had the option and the funding to make a better life for Shankar, but they chose not to take it. I do believe his death was preventable,” Dhawan emphasises.Currently studying at Stanford University, she hopes that the death will urge more Indian youngsters to speak up against the exploitation of animals for public entertainment. Her focus is now Rambo, the African elephant in Mysuru who has been alone since 2016 following the death of his father. “I really hope that Shankar’s death highlights the need to save Rambo before it’s too late.”","Shankar, Delhi's only African elephant, died on Wednesday at the age of 29.

Charlie Kirk’s assassination has shocked the world and now, his old controversial comments about Taylor Swift have resurfaced. While Taylor Swift has remained silent about it, Charlie Kirk’s wife and his business partner, Erika Kirk, has dragged in the billionaire pop star into the drama again. This has sparked outrage among fans.A few hours ago, right wing podcast host and an employee of Charlie Kirk’s organisation, Turning Point USA, Alex Clark made a post on X that read as, ""Last night Erika gave us specific direction: 'I want the Taylor Swift concert to look like nothing compared to this.'

The India-Pakistan Asia Cup Super Four clash in Dubai delivered yet another spicy moment when Abhishek Sharma and Haris Rauf locked horns in the middle, forcing the umpire to intervene.The incident unfolded in the fifth over of India’s chase. Shubman Gill, already looking in fine touch, faced Rauf’s short-of-a-length delivery outside off.With minimal fuss, Gill swivelled and short-arm jabbed the ball wide of mid-wicket, splitting the gap perfectly for four.The stroke raced away to the fence, intensifying pressure on Pakistan’s premier fast bowler.But instead of the camera following Gill’s brilliance, attention quickly shifted to the non-striker’s end.Abhishek Sharma and Rauf were seen exchanging words, with tempers flaring enough for on-field umpire Gazi Sohel to step in between the two.Though the microphones didn’t capture the exact words, the animated body language told its own story, with the young Indian opener refusing to back down and the fiery Pakistani quick just as unwilling to let things slide.Watch:This latest exchange came on the heels of earlier flashpoints involving India’s openers and Pakistan’s fast bowlers.Abhishek had already rattled Shaheen Afridi with a first-ball six followed by a verbal jab, while Gill had pointed out the direction of a boundary after cutting loose against the left-arm spearhead.By the time Rauf got involved, the rivalry had gone well beyond bat and ball.For India, these charged-up moments underlined a fearless approach in chasing 172, Pakistan’s highest T20I total against them batting first.

What did Suryakumar Yadav, Kuldeep Yadav and others say on playing Pakistan? | Asia Cup 2025

The India-Pakistan Asia Cup Super Four clash in Dubai erupted with early drama as India’s openers Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill both went after Pakistan’s premier fast bowler Shaheen Afridi — with the bat and with words.The fireworks began on the very first ball of the chase.Shaheen went short, angling it into Abhishek, who swivelled, caught a top edge on the pull, and watched the ball sail over fine leg for six.Instead of walking away, Abhishek turned towards the bowler and had a few words, setting the stage for a charged contest.But the tension didn’t end there.Two overs later, Gill joined the act. Dancing down the track to a length delivery outside off, he smashed Shaheen past extra cover for four.The shot screamed authority, but what followed lit up the moment even more, Gill pointed with his hand in the direction where the ball sped away, almost as if to remind Shaheen exactly how cleanly he had been struck.The Pakistan pacer, visibly irritated, chose not to engage and simply turned his back.These fiery exchanges added to an already high-stakes chase after Pakistan had posted 171/5, their highest total against India when batting first in T20Is.Sahibzada Farhan’s half-century and Faheem Ashraf’s late burst powered the innings, while India’s sloppy fielding — including four dropped catches — only piled on frustration.For Abhishek, who had been guilty of two dropped chances in the field, the intent to counter-attack was both a redemption arc and a statement of confidence.With Gill backing him up in equal measure, India’s openers not only provided a brisk start but also sent a clear message: Shaheen Afridi, Pakistan’s strike weapon, would not have it easy tonight.","India's openers Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill both went after Pakistan’s premier fast bowler Shaheen Afridi.

Who is Chelsea Wolfe: Past controversies, clashes with US cycling and Olympic journey

Chelsea Wolfe, a transgender BMX freestyle rider from Florida, is facing huge backlash after celebrating the murder of Charlie Kirk. On September 10, 2025, Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old conservative activist, was shot and killed while giving a speech at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.

She made history in June 2021 by qualifying as the first openly transgender athlete for Team USA at the Tokyo Olympics, where she was listed as an alternate in women’s BMX freestyle.But Wolfe has long courted controversy.

WNBA reportedly fines Caitlin Clark over comment on referees during playoffs

Indiana Fever advances to semifinals without Caitlin Clark after dramatic win over

WNBA sensation Caitlin Clark recently claimed that she was fined $200 by the league for reportedly criticizing referees on Instagram on Saturday. At Saturday's Indiana Fever practice, Clark garnered attention by yelling at reporters across the room. She then later took to Instagram to reportedly mock the referees of the match. Meanwhile, after being sidelined in early September due to a groin injury, she is not anticipated to participate during the postseason. Indiana Fever player Caitlin Clark recently claimed that the WNBA reportedly punished her for a remark she made on Instagram against the league referees. Clark shared several crying and laughing emoticons on her X account on Saturday and wrote:""Got fined $200 for this. BENCH MOB WILL BE EVEN MORE ROWDY TOMORROW LETS GOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!”A screenshot of a post Clark made on Instagram on September 17, the day after the Indiana Fever's Game 2 win over the Atlanta Dream in the first round of the WNBA playoffs, was also shared with the post.The post featured a picture of the Fever bench partying after their win that was uploaded on the team's account with the caption, ""the bench was ROCKIN' tonight.""Clark replied by commenting:""Elite bench mob"" and ""Refs couldn't stop us.""She further claimed that the Fever bench would be even more active for Sunday's Game 1 of their semifinal series against the Las Vegas Aces. Meanwhile, in the WNBA's opinion, that second remark probably deserved a fine.Clark, however, has been out since July 15 due to a groin injury.Later, Clark's teammate, Sophie Cunningham reposted Clark's post and joked that someone ought to start a fundraising to help Clark cover the fee. Cunningham wrote:""That’s gonna really break the bank for her. Starting a GoFundMe now!""Late in Game 2 of the first-round series against the Golden State Valkyries , a Fever player seemed to have hurt her foot. The Fever then recovered from their Game 1 loss to beat the Dream 87-85 in Game 3 of the three-game series despite being without Clark and a number of other players due to season-ending injuries.The Indiana Fever will now hit the road on Sunday to play Game 1 of the WNBA semifinal series against the Las Vegas Aces.

NFL issues warning: No protection for players joining Tom Brady’s Saudi flag football game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-issues-warning-no-protection-for-players-joining-tom-bradys-saudi-flag-football-game/articleshow/124022729.cms,"The NFL has cautioned players about participating in Tom Brady's flag football event in Saudi Arabia.

NFL warns players of consequences without league backing

Star power adds intrigue, but risks loom large

The NFL has sent a clear message to its players: think twice before stepping onto the field for Tom Brady’s upcoming flag football showcase in Saudi Arabia. Despite the excitement surrounding the March 2026 event, the league is distancing itself from the exhibition, warning players that participation carries risks outside official protections.According to a memo circulated to all 32 teams, the NFL emphasized that it “will not be part of Saudi exhibition game” and reminded organizations that player involvement requires written approval. The league clarified, “This Event is not an NFL-sanctioned event, and the league has no role in the organization or production of the game.”More critically, the statement highlighted that “any injury sustained while participating in the Event will be considered a Non-Football Injury.” In plain terms, this means no salary protection, no insurance coverage, and no team responsibility if a star player gets hurt while competing. For athletes whose livelihoods depend on their health, that’s a high-stakes gamble.Still, the roster Brady has assembled is hard to ignore. Saquon Barkley, Christian McCaffrey, CeeDee Lamb, Maxx Crosby, Sauce Gardner, Myles Garrett, George Kittle, Fred Warner, and Rob Gronkowski are among the headliners expected to play.The event mirrors the Olympic-style format set to debut at the 2028 Los Angeles Games, adding to its prestige and appeal.For many players, the Saudi tournament represents more than an exhibition—it’s a chance to grow the sport globally and share the field with icons in a lighter, faster-paced version of football. Yet the NFL’s firm stance introduces a sobering reality: athletes may have to weigh personal ambition against career security.Also Read: Controversial Josh Allen kneeldown sparks Dolphins–NFL discussions, Mike McDaniel believes ball was fumbled With Brady and Gronk bringing their star power back into the spotlight, fans are eager to see history in the making.

Why Ryan Helsley is being linked to Chicago

The gamble vs reward involved in this trade for the Cubs

Here’s a quick breakdown of the situation:

Aspect Pros Cons Cubs’ bullpen need



Helsley could fill in immediately with Palencia sidelined



Risk if Palencia cannot return and Helsley also struggles



Helsley’s profile



Proven velocity and dominance before trade



Performance fell sharply with Mets



Financial side



Lowered price tag after poor Mets stint



Still requires multiyear commitment





Themay be forced to take a bold approach in fixing their bullpen this winter. With injuries and underperformance leaving their closer situation in flux, Sports Illustrated’s Zach Pressnell suggests the team could take a chance on, a once-dominant reliever whose stock has dropped following a disappointing stint with the New York Mets.The Cubs entered the season with Ryan Pressly as their designated closer after signing him over the winter. However, Pressly’s struggles quickly led to a change. Daniel Palencia stepped in and thrived in the role, becoming a steady presence at the back of the bullpen.• Palencia appeared in 52 games this year• He posted a 3.00 ERA across 51 innings• He converted 22 saves before suffering a right shoulder strainPalencia is now on the 15-day injured list, and his postseason availability remains uncertain. This setback leaves the Cubs with a significant hole in their bullpen as they prepare for potential October baseball.The Mets acquired Ryan Helsley at the trade deadline in an effort to boost their relief corps. But his performance took a nosedive after joining New York. While he pitched effectively in the first half of the season, his struggles in a Mets uniform have diminished his free-agent value heading into the offseason.Pressnell believes this is where the Cubs could pounce: “Helsley was dominant in the first half, but fell off when he joined the Mets. His price tag is likely a bit lower now than it was a few months ago, though his talent is still there. The Cubs could target him on a four-year deal to make the flamethrower the closer of the future in the Windy City.” – Zach Pressnell, Sports IllustratedIf the Cubs pursue Helsley, it will be a calculated risk. His struggles in New York have raised questions, but his track record shows he has the talent to dominate when healthy and confident.The Cubs are expected to target bullpen help this winter regardless of Palencia’s health status. Helsley represents a high-risk, high-reward option. If he returns to his pre-trade form, he could become one of the biggest steals of the offseason and stabilize the closer role in Chicago for years.Also read: MLB Trade Rumors: Detroit Tigers Reportedly Eyeing $120 Million Boston Red Sox All-Star in Aggressive Free Agency Pursuit The coming months will determine if the Cubs are willing to take that gamble and make Helsley a key piece of their future bullpen plans.","The New York Mets acquired Ryan Helsley at the trade deadline in an effort to boost their relief corps.

The Kansas City Chiefs face a pivotal challenge on Sunday Night Football as they take on the New York Giants in a must-win battle to avoid an 0-3 start. While Patrick Mahomes leads his team on the road under the bright lights of MetLife Stadium, his wife Brittany Mahomes is tackling her own demanding game plan at home with their three children.Brittany, who has been a constant presence cheering on her husband, recently showed fans a glimpse of her lively household. In an Instagram Stories video, she revealed a movie theater room scattered with toys as daughter Sterling, 4, and son Bronze, 2, turned it into what looked like a playground. “Every room in our house has turned into a playground,” Brittany joked, giving followers a candid look at life behind the scenes.This isn’t the first time the Mahomes kids have taken center stage. From Bronze diving into a ball pit to mom and dad setting up elaborate obstacle courses, the couple often embraces the chaos. Just last week, Brittany stunned in a red crop top at the Chiefs’ home opener while cradling baby Golden, then switched gears to celebrate Patrick’s 30th birthday at 1587 Prime Steakhouse—his new Kansas City restaurant with Travis Kelce—where she even snapped a memorable photo with Taylor Swift.Kansas City Chiefs battle pressure in must-win matchupWhile Brittany manages the whirlwind at home, Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid are facing one of the toughest stretches of their careers. The Chiefs are 0-2 for the first time in Mahomes’ eight seasons as the starting quarterback. Counting their Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, Kansas City has now dropped three straight games—something that has never happened under Mahomes.The challenge grows bigger against a fired-up Giants crowd, but history shows the Chiefs rarely stay down for long. Much like the Patriots dynasty under Bill Belichick and Tom Brady, the Mahomes-Reid duo remains a constant Super Bowl threat as long as the quarterback stays healthy and the head coach keeps leading.As Patrick tries to steady the Chiefs on the field, Brittany is proving that sometimes the toughest job isn’t under the stadium lights—it’s keeping order in a house full of toddlers.Also Read: Pregnant Cardi B fiercely addresses paternity drama surrounding Stefon Diggs with unapologetic message to critics",Brittany Mahomes shares playful chaos inside family home with her three children.

Cardi B addresses Stefon Diggs’ paternity case in fiery Instagram rant



Real life and music collide for Cardi B



If there was any doubt about where Cardi B stands, the rapper made it crystal clear—she is standing firmly by Stefon Diggs . The Grammy-winning artist, who recently revealed she is expecting a child with the New England Patriots wide receiver, took to Instagram Live to address the headlines surrounding his ongoing paternity case. Her fiery words left no room for speculation.In a moment that instantly went viral, Cardi B referenced Shirley Brown’s 1974 soul classic “Woman to Woman” to deliver her own scathing twist. “That’s your baby daddy, bh? That’s my baby daddy, too… What now? I don’t fing know. We’ll figure it out, b***h,” she said, refusing to back down from critics while making it clear she won’t let the situation shake her relationship.Her comments came after court documents surfaced showing model Aileen Lopera, known online as Lord Gisselle, had filed a petition in Los Angeles Superior Court. The filing, submitted while she was still pregnant, named Diggs as the father of her now five-month-old daughter, Charliee. Lopera requested full legal and physical custody, leaving the NFL star visitation rights only, while also asking him to cover medical costs and attorney fees.Diggs, 31, has not denied the possibility of paternity but filed for a DNA test in July, stating he was “not certain” of the child’s parentage. The matter escalated when TMZ released footage of Diggs leaving a hospital carrying a baby carrier. Lopera’s attorney, however, clarified that the woman in the clip was not his client.Cardi B, 32, is no stranger to living in the spotlight, and this latest controversy unfolded just as her new album Am I the Drama? soared to the top of the Billboard charts. The rapper, already a mother of three with her estranged husband Offset, now finds herself navigating new motherhood with Diggs while their names dominate both gossip columns and sports pages.For now, her message is simple: she is standing by Diggs, no matter how messy the headlines get. And if her words are any indication, Cardi B is ready to face the drama head-on.Also Read: Najee Harris leaves fans worried after being carted off with serious-looking leg injury vs. Broncos","Cardi B addresses Stefon Diggs’ paternity case in fiery Instagram rant.

Chargers running back Najee Harris suffers non-contact injury



Harris’ career achievements and impact



Los Angeles Chargers running back Najee Harris was carted off the field in the second quarter of Sunday’s game against the Denver Broncos after suffering a concerning lower left leg injury. The 27-year-old went down in a non-contact situation at SoFi Stadium, leaving both teammates and fans holding their breath as he was ruled out for the remainder of the game.The moment unfolded as Harris planted his left leg while preparing to take a handoff in the backfield. Almost immediately, he collapsed to the turf in visible pain and was unable to get up. Medical staff rushed to his side before he was carted away, unable to put weight on his leg. Later, the Chargers announced he had sustained an ankle injury.It was another tough setback for Harris, who had already dealt with adversity this year. He missed much of the offseason while recovering from an eye injury caused by a fireworks accident on July 4. Despite limited training camp participation, Harris was cleared in time for the regular season and had shown flashes of promise before Sunday’s scare.Prior to exiting the game, he recorded six carries for 28 yards, adding to his season total of 61 yards on 15 carries and three receptions for 25 yards.Harris has built a reputation as a reliable workhorse since entering the league. A first-round draft pick out of Alabama, he was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2021 and earned Pro Bowl honors in his rookie season. Over five NFL seasons with the Steelers and Chargers, Harris has logged 4,373 rushing yards, 28 touchdowns, and 183 receptions for 1,174 yards with six additional scores.His consistent production and ability to carry an offense make his absence a huge concern for the Chargers. While the team awaits further updates, the hope is that this injury is not as severe as it initially appeared. For now, fans will be watching closely, hoping Harris can return to the field and continue the career that has already made him one of the league’s most dependable backs.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes and wife Brittany turn heads during date night at his and Travis Kelce’s new dining venture","Los Angeles Chargers running back Najee Harris was carted off the field in the second quarter of Sunday’s game against the Denver Broncos.

At the Aramis launch event in Bloomingdale this week, rookie guard VJ Edgecombe of the Philadelphia 76ers had an amazing experience. During the same, he connected with Dwyane Wade , a player he was compared to prior to the draft. Wade has been collaborating with Aramis, an Estée Lauder fragrance brand, as part of his off-court commercial endeavors. Images that Edgecombe met Wade at the Aramis launch event have recently gone viral on social media as well.The Philadelphia 76ers wanted to improve their lineup for the upcoming season after the 2024-25 NBA season ended in disappointment. In the 2025 NBA draft, they chose VJ Edgecombe with the third overall pick.Edgecombe was regarded as one of the best players in the 2024 class and a five-star prospect by most. He started getting attention shortly after he joined the league as Benedict Mathurin made headlines by disparaging him before his NBA debut.During his first summer league match against the Utah Jazz, VJ Edgecombe left a mark even after reportedly facing hate speech. The 76ers fans eagerly awaited him during the 2025–2026 NBA season. Edgecombe, however, got a chance to meet a legend before the season started.He met NBA legend Dwyane Wade at the widely shared Aramis launch, according to the social media images that went viral. Wade and Aramis work together on his off-court commercial endeavors. Seeing him at the launch ceremony was expected, but for Edgecombe, it was surreal.The Hall of Famer was present there because he has been aggressively building his post-NBA portfolio through ownership, sponsorships, and the media. However, it was a full-circle introduction for Edgecombe Edgecombe had been compared with D-Wade. Wade was a skilled scorer who could dominate in crucial situations and create the half-court when he first joined the NBA. In contrast, Edgecombe remains undeveloped in areas such as creating shots, pulling up shots, and managing significant offensive responsibilities. Nevertheless, he is talented and with right guidance and enough practice, he can actually be like Wade.NBA legend Dwyane Wade made news last month when it was announced that he would be the new face of the high-end fragrance line Aramis. Gabrielle Union-Wade , his actress wife, then posted a touching Instagram story that captured his husband's recent achievement.During an event of Aramis, the couple were dressed in matching black and white outfits. The event took place three months after the NBA icon announced that he will serve as Aramis' global ambassador.Later, during an interview, while talking about it, D-Wade said:“As a young boy, you’re very impressionable. And I was impressed by my father and my uncles growing up.. I saw them do [it] every time they got ready: when they got fresh, they hit themselves with the cologne before they walked out the door. I used to wear my dad’s cologne when I was a kid—it was way too strong for me back then.”Aramis and the player also collaborated on the campaign's artistic direction.Also read: Gabrielle Union shares Instagram story in matching outfits with Dwyane Wade to celebrate his Aramis debut","Philadelphia 76ers rookie guard VJ Edgecombe met NBA legend Dwyane Wade at Aramis launch in a surreal moment before 2025–26 season.

Fire, fury, and fireworks

Pakistan cash in on India’s sloppy fielding

""The best mirror is an old friend,” is a classical line by famous English poet George Herbert.Those lines seemed to have been written for Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma when the duo were batting together against Pakistan in their Super 4s clash at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.Gill and Abhishek were matching each other shot-for-shot and put on 105-runs for the opening wicket.On the eve of yet another highly-anticipated India vs Pakistan clash, only three Indian cricketers turned up for the optional practice session. Shubman Gill and Abhishek were two of them. Gill was struggling for runs, and it was Abhishek who lent him the comforting arm . He bowled in tandem with the net bowlers for an hour to Shubman. He challenged him to play sweep shots, teased his inability to hit the reverse sweep, and requested Varun Chakravarthy to trouble Gill with his variations. A day later, the duo, who have batted together since their U-12 days in Punjab , were at their destructive best.Chasing a stiff target of 172, India’s chase got off to a fiery start as Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill smashed a 100-run stand in just 8.4 overs. If Abhishek was at his destructive best, it was Gill who showed why he is such a delight to the eyes. In an expected high-voltage clash, which became even more dramatic due to the events of the past weeks , the Pakistani seamers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf started to abuse them in Punjabi. Shaheen had a go at Abhishek after being smacked for a six off the first ball.Shaheen then hurled a few abuses at Shubman, who looked at Shaheen and pointed with his hand where the ball went. There was a shade of Aamer Sohail vs Venky Prasad from 1996 to it. Haris Rauf hurled abuses at Abhishek, who hammered him for two boundaries, and the umpires had to intervene to separate Rauf and Abhishek.Abhishek set the tone by pulling Shaheen Afridi for a six off the very first over, while Gill, who had worked tirelessly in the nets on the eve of the match, struck boundaries with authority off Saim Ayub's off-spin. Their aggression only grew, with Abhishek dispatching Abrar Ahmed for towering sixes and Gill unfurling a reverse sweep — a stroke his partner had teased him about less than 24 hours ago.Abhishek raced to a 25-ball fifty, surviving two dropped chances along the way, while Gill kept the tempo high with crisp drives and sweeps. The partnership was finally broken at 105 when Gill, after battling cramps, was bowled by Faheem Ashraf for a brisk 47 off 28.India’s openers had set the chase alight with their fearless strokeplay and fiery exchanges, leaving Pakistan searching for answers. Abhishek departed for a sizzling 39-ball 74.India did lose quick wickets - Gill and then Suryakumar Yadav in the space of four balls - but it was too late for Pakistan. India chased down the total in 18.5 overs with six wickets in hand.India’s fielding woes came to the fore as they spilled five chances, allowing Pakistan to post a competitive 171/5.Sahibzada Farhan, the biggest beneficiary, rode his luck to a breezy half-century after being dropped twice by Abhishek Sharma.Abhishek first misjudged a regulation chance at third man when Farhan was on zero. The opener made India pay with crisp strokeplay, taking on Jasprit Bumrah for two boundaries and carting Varun Chakravarthy for back-to-back fours. He even finished the powerplay with two more boundaries off Bumrah as Pakistan raced to 55/1 after six overs.Farhan’s second life came in Varun’s over when Abhishek, stationed at long-on, covered ground to his right and leapt full stretch but failed to hold on, palming the ball over the ropes for six. The right-hander didn’t look back, slamming Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel for towering sixes to bring up his fifty, and his celebration took you back to MS Dhoni's first hundred against Pakistan.At 91/1 in 10 overs, Pakistan looked in control before Shivam Dube’s golden arm turned things around. He broke the 72-run stand by deceiving Saim Ayub with a slower one; this time Abhishek made amends with a diving catch running in from deep square. Dube then accounted for Farhan with another slower ball, Surya Yadav holding his nerve despite the batter’s bat flying out of his hands mid-shot.Kuldeep tightened the screws as Pakistan endured 21 balls without a boundary. Hussain Talat fell cheaply before skipper Salman Ali Agha ended the boundary drought, which lasted for 37 balls, with a six off the first ball of the 17th over. Dube’s fine spell, however, was blemished when Nawaz plundered 17 runs. Nawaz was then found napping as he didn’t plant his bat in the crease and Surya’s direct hit connected on the bounce.Fielding lapses continued to haunt India. Shubman Gill spilled a sitter at deep mid-wicket, giving Faheem Ashraf a reprieve. Bumrah endured a rare off day, finishing wicketless for 45 runs in his four overs. Pakistan eventually closed at 171/5, aided by India’s butterfingers as Faheem’s late six came off yet another dropped chance, this time the culprit was Shivam Dube, who misjudged a catch at the third-man region.For India, despite the five missed opportunities, their bowlers kept Pakistan in check, but the lack of discipline in the field left the contest delicately poised heading into the chase.",Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma put on 105-run stand for the opening wicket. Pakistan seamers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf started to abuse them in Punjabi. India's fielding woes came to the fore as they spilled five chances.

'My job is to play': Haris Rauf stays calm as Pakistan ride out Asia Cup drama

WATCH:

WACTH:

NEW DELHI: The high-octane India vs Pakistan clash in the Asia Cup 2025 Super Four in Dubai on Sunday, did not just serve up a six-wicket win for India — it also delivered fresh controversy. Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf found himself in the middle of a storm after he taunted Indian fans with a provocative “6-0” gesture near the boundary ropes, a moment that has since gone viral on social media.The gesture, captured in multiple videos and photos, showed Rauf raising his hand to signal “6-0,” a reference to Pakistan’s unverified and politically charged claims of downing six Indian fighter jets during a four-day military scuffle following Operation Sindoor. During the match at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, the pacer even acted out the motion of a crashing plane, further fuelling tensions.The incident unfolded while Rauf was fielding close to a packed Indian section of the crowd. Fans had been chanting “Kohli, Kohli” to rile him up, a reminder of Virat Kohli’s iconic straight six off his bowling in the T20 World Cup 2022. In response, the 31-year-old pacer gestured towards them with the controversial signal, triggering loud boos from Indian supporters and sparking outrage online.The cricket, however, was dominated by India. Chasing 172, Abhishek Sharma hammered a blistering 74 off just 39 balls, including six fours and five towering sixes. His 105-run opening stand with Shubman Gill (47) laid the perfect platform, as Tilak Varma (30*) and Hardik Pandya (7*) sealed the win in 18.5 overs.On-field tensions between Rauf and Indian players also flared. In the fifth over, after Gill cracked a crisp boundary, Rauf exchanged heated words with Abhishek Sharma, forcing umpire Gazi Sohel to step in. Though tempers cooled quickly, the episode added to the charged atmosphere.",Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf taunts Indian fans with '6-0' gesture.

How Shubman Gill is getting ready for Pakistan challenge in Asia Cup

Poll Should the Indian players have shaken hands with their Pakistani counterparts after the match? Yes, it's a sportsmanlike gesture No, tensions are too high

The handshake controversy between India and Pakistan refused to die down on Sunday, with Indian players once again walking past their opponents without doing the customary gesture at the Asia Cup Super Four clash in Dubai.The incident mirrored what unfolded in the group-stage meeting a week earlier, when India captain Suryakumar Yadav had avoided shaking hands with Pakistan skipper Salman Agha at the toss.That moment had sparked heated discussion among fans and media, with questions raised about whether the tension would spill over into their next encounter.At the toss this time, Suryakumar ignored Agha once again, heading directly to commentator Ravi Shastri before greeting match referee Andy Pycroft. The Indian captain later said, “We are going to bowl first. It is a good pitch. Some dew came during our practice session last night. I am really looking forward to this game. Jasprit Bumrah comes back, Varun Chakaravarthy also comes back in for Harshit Rana and Arshdeep Singh. ”The absence of a handshake at the end of the game drew even more attention. After completing the chase, India batters Tilak Varma and Hardik Pandya turned towards their dressing room and headed straight to the team camp, skipping the traditional handshake with the Pakistan players.To make things even more tense, Indian players headed out of the dressing room after the win, started to walk towards the Pakistani players, only to shake hands with the umpires and match officials and turn back.India, thanks to an aggressive chase, won the game in style, with Tilak Varma hitting the winning four, meaning India won by six wickets and with 7 balls to spare. The 172-run target set by Pakistan proved to be too less to avoid a second defeat to the defending Asia Cup champions.Ahead of the clash, Suryakumar had already faced questions about the issue during a press conference, though he deflected them. When asked indirectly about whether India’s “no-handshake” stance would continue, he replied: “What other things are you talking about? You are talking about our performance with the ball? It is a good contest between bat and ball. The whole stadium is packed to the rafters. The best thing is to put your best foot forward and do the best for your country. ”The episode made sure that the spotlight stayed on the off-field tensions, even as the cricket itself provided its own drama. The handshake row has now become one of the biggest talking points of the Asia Cup 2025, and shows no signs of fading.",India beat Pakistan by six wickets in the Asia Cup Super Four clash in Dubai.

Poll Who should be credited as the standout player in India's victory over Pakistan? Abhishek Sharma Suryakumar Yadav Shivam Dube Shubman Gill

India maintained their dominance over Pakistan in international cricket and the Asia Cup , defeating their arch-rivals by six wickets in the Super 4s clash on Sunday. Opener Abhishek Sharma led the charge with a blazing 74, putting on a record 105-run opening stand with Shubman Gill as India chased down 172 with seven balls to spare.The contest was played under tense conditions following the handshake controversy from their previous group-stage meeting, but Suryakumar Yadav, India’s captain, focused on the on-field performance rather than off-field drama.Speaking to reporters after the win, Suryakumar downplayed the idea of a rivalry. “You guys should stop asking questions about the rivalry between India-Pakistan. According to me, if two teams play 15-20 matches, and if it is even, then it is a rivalry. 10-0, 10-1, I don't know what the stat is, but this is not a rivalry anymore. I think we played better cricket than them (Pakistan), and also from a bowling point of view,” he said, referring to India’s dominant head-to-head record in T20Is, which now stands at 12-3.India faced some fielding challenges during Pakistan’s innings, with several catches dropped early on. The captain joked about the errors, saying, “I think the fielding coach has already emailed players whose hands had some butter on them. It’s good that this happened early on because we have more crucial games going forward.” He also rejected the idea that floodlights were to blame.Abhishek Sharma’s innings was the highlight of the chase. Yadav praised the opener’s composure and game awareness: “He is very selfless. He can bat in the same way after the powerplay. But he analyses it beautifully. He is learning every day.”He also showered praise on the opening duo, saying, ""They are ice and fire. They complement each other very well.""On the team’s strategy, he explained the decision to field first after winning the toss: “When we played on the 14th, the wicket was better from the batting point of view. The wicket has improved.”India’s bowling heroics also received praise, with Shivam Dube’s four overs turning the match in India’s favour. “Shivam Dube’s spell was the turning point. He bowled his entire quota and he was very happy,” Yadav added. Dube claimed key wickets of Pakistan opener Sahibzada Farhan and Saim Ayub to dampen the flow of runs early in the innings.The win not only strengthened India’s position in the Super 4s but also showed the balance between power-hitting and bowling in their squad, with Suryakumar choosing to focus on performance over rivalry.",India beat Pakistan by six wickets in Super 4s clash in Dubai.

Tyler Herro sends a strong message amid injury recovery



Miami Heat facing early challenges and looming contract talks



Tyler Herro will not be on the court when the Miami Heat tip off their 2025-26 campaign. The guard underwent surgery on his left foot and ankle to repair posterior impingement syndrome, an injury that had plagued him since the offseason. The procedure, performed last Friday, is expected to sideline him for about eight weeks, pushing his return into mid-November and forcing Miami to start the season without its leading scorer.25-year-old guard Tyler Herro initially attempted to avoid surgery through platelet-rich plasma and cortisone injections, but the pain persisted, according to Herald. Doctors ultimately recommended surgery, which was deemed successful. The projected timetable means Herro could miss the team’s first 14 games.Herro didn’t stay quiet after the procedure. From the hospital bed, he took to Instagram to share his mindset during recovery: “Imma tear the league back down once I get off this weak off bed.” The post, which included a photo of Herro flashing a middle finger, sent a strong message about his determination to return.His absence is a significant blow for Miami. Last season, Herro delivered a career year, averaging 23.9 points, 5.5 assists, and 5.2 rebounds in 77 games while shooting 47.2 percent from the field and 37.5 percent from deep.He earned his first All-Star selection, won the Three-Point Contest, and quickly established himself as the Heat’s primary scoring option. The team scored 8.6 fewer points per 100 possessions when he was not on the floor.With Herro sidelined, Miami will look to offseason acquisition Norman Powell and second-year guard Pelle Larsson to absorb more playmaking responsibilities. Bam Adebayo’s versatility will be critical, but the Heat will be hard-pressed to replace Herro’s offensive creation during the opening stretch of the season.Beyond basketball, the injury arrives at a delicate moment in Herro’s career. He becomes eligible on October 1 for an extension that could add three years and $149.7 million to his existing deal. If no agreement is reached by October 20, he would be in line for a four-year, $206.9 million extension next summer.Also Read: Stephen Curry shares candid remarks about his off-court duties as parent alongside wife Ayesha Curry","Tyler Herro underwent surgery on his left foot and ankle to repair posterior impingement syndrome.

Stephen Curry has built an astonishing legacy on the NBA hardwood. However, away from the spotlight, his most demanding role happens at home. The Golden State Warriors star is the father of four children with his wife, Ayesha Curry , and he admits that life beyond basketball is filled with unpredictability, laughter, and plenty of lessons for the 37-year-old. In a recent interview, Curry shared details of parenting with his wife.The four-time NBA champion Stephen Curry says raising children at completely different life stages has shaped him as a parent. His oldest daughter, Riley, is now 13, Ryan, 10, and Canon, 7, while his youngest, Caius, is just 15 months.“Every day is a wild experience, and I’m enjoying every little bit of it,” Curry told PEOPLE. “Fans would see there’s no such thing as balance, but you try every day to figure it out.”The spread of ages, Curry explains, forces him and Ayesha to adapt constantly. “Your ability to communicate and build trust with each one individually — like, you set up rules for the house, but each one has to be parented a little differently. That’s the cool part of the experience as a parent, and I’m loving every single minute of it.”Beyond the challenges, he says the true reward is watching his children grow into unique personalities.“They all teach me something every day… they’re hilarious — they ask questions that make you think. They all came from the same place, but they have such different personalities.”Curry also points out that consistency is central to how he and Ayesha raise their family. One rule they enforce is a strict no-games policy on school nights. It’s a tradition he borrowed directly from his parents, Sonya and Dell Curry.“That’s the one part of the parent playbook that we kept — just cut, copy, and paste,” Curry said. “On school nights you gotta make sure you’re getting your rest so you can get to school, have a good time, and learn.”Still, when game days roll around, rules soften. “They’re spoiled when they come to games,” he joked. “They try to get every snack, candy, treat — whatever you wanna call it. There’s really no limit at games ’cause I want ’em to have fun.”Also Read: ""Mind your fkn business""- Stephen Curry's heartwarming defense of Ayesha Curry gets instant support as Killer Mike faces wrath from fans online Curry and Ayesha have been one of the NBA’s power couples, and they are certainly the proud parents.","NBA star Stephen Curry is the father of four children with his wife, Ayesha.

Michael Beasley had a bone to pick with Miami Heat’s coach Erik Spoelstra

Michael Beasley gradually understood Erik Spoelstra’s ideologies

Being a Miami Heat player is a big deal, as it comes with dire consequences. Apart from all of these, being with coach Erik Spoelstra is not for the weak, and Michael Beasley made it very clear. The franchise has had some exceptional players, including Beasley, largely due to their extremely talented coach, Erik Spoelstra. However, the ex-Heat star claimed that he still held some grudge against their head coach, Spoelstra. Most importantly, if one is not ready to give their hundred percent, they can’t be on the team either, and Erik Spoelstra is the epitome of dedication, discipline, and hard work. Here’s why the former Heat star used to have beef with Erik Spoelstra:There is no doubt that Erik Spoelstra has been a great coach of the Heat. However, some players might still have a bone to pick with him, including former Heat star Michael Beasley. “Everything that happened to you, good and bad, you are the common denominator”, Beasley said on “All the Smoke”. “Whether it was your fault or not, you gotta understand what you did wrong and what you could have done better.”Michael Beasley claimed that during his early years with the franchise, he used to blame coach Erik Spoelstra for all his struggles.However, when asked about his true feelings for Spoelstra, he made sure to keep himself out of controversy and gave a diplomatic answer.Had this been a decade ago, Michael Beasley would be in his “beefing” era. But as time went on, he gradually understood the true nature of Coach Erik Spoelstra. “I don’t blame no coaches. But I used to blame Spo a lot”, Michael Beasley said. “The older I got, the more I realized. My rookie year was his rookie year. Just as scared as I was of Riles, he was probably more (scared)”“From a 19-year-old’s perspective, you gotta think… It could have been SpongeBob in that coach spot, and I respected it because it was the head coach. I was more scared of Spo than he wants to believe. I didn’t know how to display my frustration in any other way but anger. Because it would just blow up, right? I was 19”, Beasley explained further. Well, faceoffs with Spoelstra are just as tough as playing against Beasley, but Beasley facing Spoelstra is quite a challenge, and both understood it well.Also read: Golden State Warriors trio want Jonathan Kuminga to stay with the team for upcoming season","Former Miami Heat star Michael Beasley had a bone to pick with Erik Spoelstra.

Wendell Smallwood’s fall from NFL glory to $645K COVID-19 fraud sentence

Former Eagles running back charged with fraud tied to COVID-19 relief programs

Wendell Smallwood expresses regret: ""I have nobody to blame but myself""



Former Philadelphia Eagles running back Wendell Smallwood Jr., once a promising NFL talent, now faces a harsh reality. On September 18, Judge Richard G. Andrews sentenced Smallwood to 18 months in federal prison for orchestrating multiple pandemic-era fraud schemes worth over $600,000. The fall from NFL glory to criminal conviction has stunned fans and marked a dramatic turn in the life of the Wilmington, Delaware native.Smallwood’s football journey began in Wilmington, Delaware, with dreams of making it to the NFL. Drafted 153rd overall by the Eagles in 2016, he achieved a career highlight as part of the 2017 squad that secured Philadelphia’s first-ever Super Bowl title. However, his NFL career faced setbacks, with the Eagles cutting him from the final 53-player roster in 2019. Brief stints with the Washington Redskins (2019) and Pittsburgh Steelers (2020) failed to reignite his professional career, leaving Smallwood at a crossroads.After leaving football, Smallwood turned to criminal activity. Federal prosecutors revealed that from 2020 to 2023, he orchestrated three separate schemes defrauding the U.S. government. Using fake Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) applications, along with fraudulent IRS tax filings, Smallwood siphoned or directed $645,000 for personal gain.Investigators revealed that Smallwood’s scheme involved a network of accomplices, using shell companies and kickbacks to execute the fraud. A 2023 raid at his New Jersey home uncovered assault-style firearms and high-capacity magazines, adding a separate layer of legal trouble he must still address.At his hearing, Smallwood expressed remorse. “I feel like I let the community down. I let my family down. I have nobody to blame but myself,” he told Judge Andrews. His attorney sought probation, citing his volunteer work with Wilmington’s Police Athletic League and challenging upbringing. Prosecutors highlighted the intentional and prolonged nature of the fraud.Also Read: Browns’ playoff hopes take a hit: Kicker and Punter injured ahead of Week 3 vs. Packers Once a promising NFL talent, Wendell Smallwood now faces a stark reality.

Inside the extraordinary family life of the world’s oldest woman honored by King Charles

In a touching moment of history and humanity, King Charles III visited the world’s oldest living person, 116-year-old Ethel Caterham, at Hallmark Lakeview Care Home in Lightwater, Surrey. The meeting took place shortly after the King completed his official duties, including bidding farewell to US President Donald Trump at the end of his state visit.Unlike formal royal ceremonies, this encounter was personal and heartfelt. For the King, it was an opportunity to pay respect to a woman whose lifetime spans more than a century of world events, and for Mrs. Caterham, it was the fulfillment of a wish she had expressed—to meet the monarch in person after celebrating her milestone birthday.Ethel Caterham was born on 21 August 1909, in Shipton Bellinger, Hampshire, making her a witness to over 11 decades of world history. Her long life has seen humanity transition through wars, revolutions, pandemics, and technological transformations that reshaped the modern world.In April 2025, she officially became the world’s oldest living person following the death of Brazilian nun Sister Inah Canbarro Lucas, who was also 116 at the time of her passing.Beyond her age, what makes Mrs. Caterham’s life even more extraordinary is that she remains the last surviving subject of King Edward VII, connecting her directly to the Edwardian era and Britain’s early 20th-century monarchy.Throughout her 116 years, Ethel Caterham has lived through defining moments in global history. As a young child, she grew up in the aftermath of the Edwardian period, only to witness the First World War during her formative years. By the time she was 20, the world was in the grip of the Great Depression, and within a decade, she would see the devastation of the Second World War unfold.She also lived through monumental shifts such as the Russian Revolution, the decline of colonial empires, the rise of modern technology, and most recently, the Covid-19 pandemic. Few people alive today can claim to have seen the world transform in so many profound ways.As BBC reported, when King Charles III greeted Mrs. Caterham, the interaction was filled with warmth and wit. She reminisced about his 1969 investiture as the Prince of Wales, telling him: “I remember when your mother crowned you in Caernarfon Castle.”She went on to add with a smile that during his youth, “all the girls were in love with you and wanted to marry you.” The King responded with laughter and a humorous grimace, joking: “Yes well, all that’s left of him anyway.”This exchange highlighted not only Mrs. Caterham’s sharp memory but also her sense of humor, which continues to shine even after 116 years of life.Ethel Caterham’s personal life is as rich as her historical experiences. She was the second youngest of eight siblings and grew up in Tidworth, Wiltshire. At 18, she moved to India to work as an au pair for a military family, an adventure that shaped her independence at a time when international travel for women was rare.She returned to the UK at 21, where she met her future husband Norman at a dinner party in 1931. Together, they raised two daughters, building a family legacy that now includes three granddaughters and five great-grandchildren.Remarkably, she lived an active life well into her later years, even driving until the age of 97. For the past 50 years, she has made Surrey her permanent home, remaining close to her family.When Mrs. Caterham turned 115 in 2024, she received a personal congratulatory letter from King Charles, praising her for reaching a “truly remarkable milestone.” While her birthday celebration was kept quiet, she expressed that she would have gladly traded the occasion for a meeting with the King.This year, her wish came true. The King’s personal visit underscored the royal family’s long-standing tradition of honoring the nation’s oldest citizens. In the UK, it is customary for monarchs to send birthday greetings to those turning 100 or older, but in Mrs. Caterham’s case, the tribute went even further—a royal encounter in person.Supercentenarians, people who live beyond the age of 110, are extremely rare. There are fewer than 100 verified individuals alive worldwide who have reached this milestone, making Mrs. Caterham’s achievement extraordinary on a global scale. Longevity researchers study individuals like her to understand the genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors that contribute to such remarkable lifespans.In Ethel Caterham’s case, her resilience, sense of humor, and family support appear to be key contributors to her well-being. Her ability to drive until nearly 100 and remain mentally sharp well past her centenary suggests an active lifestyle played a role in her long life.","Ethel Caterham was born on 21 August 1909, in Shipton Bellinger, Hampshire, making her a witness to over 11 decades of world history.

Brian Burns exits with apparent leg injury after standout first half performance



Giants fans hold their breath but Brian Burns returns to action before halftime



Also read:

A tense first half between the New York Giants and Kansas City Chiefs took a worrying turn on Sunday Night Football when outside linebacker Brian Burns exited the game with an apparent leg injury. The two teams, both searching for their first win of the 2025 NFL season, entered the game with matching 0-2 records, and every snap felt like it could swing momentum. But Burns’ injury halted the pace of an already intense battle.Before going down, Burns had been the engine behind a fired-up Giants defense that was holding Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs to just six points. The game was tied 6–6 late in the second quarter when Burns leapt high at the line of scrimmage to bat down a Mahomes pass. It was an athletic play – but the landing didn’t look right.As Burns came down, he immediately reached for his leg and limped toward the sideline. Giants medical staff quickly checked on him, and while he was able to walk off the field under his own power, the stadium fell quiet. Before the injury, Burns had already made a major impact. In less than two quarters, he had recorded four total tackles, one sack, a tackle for loss, two passes defensed, and a quarterback hit – constantly disrupting Mahomes and making life difficult for the Kansas City offense.At that point, the Giants defense had been playing with high energy, and Burns was at the center of it. His exit not only affected the defensive line but seemed to momentarily take the air out of the team.There was a mix of concern and hope as fans watched Burns walk off without assistance. Although there was no immediate word from the team, his ability to leave the field on his own gave some optimism that the injury may not be serious. That moment briefly shifted the tone of the game, with the Giants defense looking noticeably unsettled in the minutes that followed. The potential loss of one of their top defensive players had the crowd and sideline on edge. Fortunately for New York, the scare didn’t last long. Burns rejoined the defense before halftime, a massive relief for the Giants, who are fighting to avoid a disastrous 0-3 start to the season. His return sparked energy on the field and restored confidence in a unit that had been playing inspired football.While an official update on his condition is still pending, his return to action suggests the Giants may have dodged a major bullet in this high-stakes Week 3 showdown.",Brian Burns had been the engine behind a fired-up Giants defense that was holding Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs to just six points.

Travis Kelce faces NFL fine for obscene gesture during Kansas City Chiefs matchup against Philadelphia Eagles

Kansas City Chiefs struggle to convert opportunities in close loss

Travis Kelce admits accountability on New Heights podcast after loss to Los Angeles Chargers

The Kansas City Chiefs began the 2025 NFL season with two straight losses, which dropped their record to 0-2 and left them sitting fourth in the AFC West division. This sluggish start has exposed ongoing challenges with the team's offense and defense. On September 14, 2025, during a 20-17 home loss to the Philadelphia Eagles at Arrowhead Stadium, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce made a rude gesture after a 23-yard catch, leading to a $14,491 fine from the NFL for unsportsmanlike conduct.The incident occurred during the second week of the 2025 season in the Chiefs' game against the Eagles. After catching a 23-yard pass, 35-year-old Kelce ran down the Philadelphia sideline and made a gesture towards his groin.The NFL categorized this as ""obscene gestures"" under unsportsmanlike conduct rules, resulting in a fine of $14,491. This is Kelce's third fine since 2021, according to reports. This year, game officials have been directed to pay more attention to such actions.Right after the game, the video of the moment went viral on social media. The fine was announced shortly after, with details coming out on September 21, 2025.In a related penalty from the same game, Eagles running back Saquon Barkley was fined $46,371 for ""impermissible use of the helmet/launching"" after he lowered his helmet before colliding with Chiefs safety Chamarri Conner. Barkley's fine was higher, underscoring the league's commitment to player safety rules.On September 14, 2025, the Chiefs faced a 20-17 loss, making it their second consecutive defeat after losing to the Los Angeles Chargers in the season opener. The offense had a tough time, with quarterback Patrick Mahomes completing 40 out of 56 passes without any interceptions, but he only averaged 211 passing yards per game in the first two weeks.

One user pointed out on X that Travis Kelce ""was so bad Friday night that not only did he never get open, but he took out our best deep threat for the year on the first drive of the game then cost us a TD in the redzone for inexplicably stopping his route on 2nd and goal.""Another post raised some worries, ""I’m not worried about Mahomes. He’ll get it figured out. I AM worried about the rest of the offense. Run game isn’t working, WR room is gutted, Kelce attracts defenders like mosquitos. Taylor f**kin sucks still.

Jonathan Kuminga rejects $75M offer as contract talks hit major roadblock

Jonathan Kuminga has repetitively made headlines for the Golden State Warriors this summer as they look forward to win their fifth championship since 2015. Although the offseason has mostly focused on Kuminga and his contract impasse, his agent just provided a significant update that may lead to him signing a contract shortly. Aaron Turner, Kuminga's agent, recently sent a direct warning amid a rumored $75.2 million contract impasse.As the October 1 qualifying offer deadline draws closer, Turner reportedly sent a warning to the Warriors' front management, according to Joseph Azizi of The Warriors Talk. Kuminga 's agent, shared his thoughts on the player's feelings throughout the negotiations on The Hoop Collective podcast.Additionally, he stated that although Kuminga would prefer to accept the player option, he would also accept the qualifying offer. If the Warriors want Kuminga to re-sign with them, they must treat him ""fairly,"" according to the agency. Turner then said:""There’s a lot of upside.. He wants to pick where he wants to go. So the QO is real for sure.. for sure there's no it's being considered completely. It's being talked about…”He continued:“We've gotten a disability policy out for him that would, you know, hedge out some of the injury risk. Um, but it's not something, you know, anybody wants to do. Neither side. I mean, Brian, you know this, right? Clearly that we wouldn't be here on September 18th on this podcast discussing this if either side wanted that to be the outcome…”He then added:“This is really a one-off situation. I can't remember where you're in the middle of the negotiation. and you're willing to bring the fans in um to hear this because I'm telling you there's incredible amount of interest in Jonathan's free agency more than I can remember..”Further talking about it, he said:“And probably because he's on the Warriors and partially because it's September and he's the number one free agent on the market and there's this and the Warriors have signed nobody officially at this point…”Since July, negotiations between Kuminga's team and the Warriors have stalled.According to reports, he first rejected Golden State's $45 million offer in search of a better offer. If the Warriors were to re-sign him on the $7.9 million qualifying offer, he would reportedly be tied under a no-trade clause for the 2025–2026 season and become an unrestricted free agent.However, he reportedly turned down the Warriors' upgraded offer of a three-year, $75.2 million contract once more because the third year had a team option rather than a player option. According to reports, Kuminga would rather accept the qualifying offer than the most recent two-year, $45 million offer from the Warriors.Furthermore, Kuminga is reportedly taking control of his future top priority. Reportedly, he is even willing to accept Golden State's initial $45 million contract if it includes a player option for the second year, which would give him more freedom with the team going forward.However, Kuminga will have to accept the one-year, $7.9 million qualifying offer if no deal is negotiated by October 1. Nevertheless, recently, Turner has reportedly cautioned the franchise that such a move might cause a great deal of tension in their partnership.Also read: NBA trade rumor – Jonathan Kuminga rejects Golden State Warriors’ $45 million offer, holds out for better deal before 2025–26 season","Jonathan Kuminga's agent, Aaron Turner, recently sent a direct warning amid a rumored $75.2 million contract impasse.
