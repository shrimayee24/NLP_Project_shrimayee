Donald Trump extends White House invite to Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes in unexpected move



The Kansas City Chiefs are set to receive a long-overdue honor as former President Donald Trump has extended an invitation to celebrate their Super Bowl LIV victory at the White House. The unexpected move comes five years after the Chiefs’ championship win was overshadowed by the global COVID-19 pandemic, preventing them from visiting Washington, D.C., at the time. Now, Trump aims to rectify the missed opportunity by welcoming Patrick Mahomes , Travis Kelce , and the rest of the Chiefs roster after hosting this year’s Super Bowl champions, the Philadelphia Eagles .On February 2, 2020, the Chiefs secured a historic victory over the San Francisco 49ers at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, lifting their first Super Bowl title in 50 years. However, just weeks later, the world was brought to a standstill by the coronavirus outbreak, leading to the cancellation of their traditional championship visit to the White House. While other Super Bowl winners in subsequent years were able to partake in the ceremonial tradition, Kansas City was left without the recognition that many teams before and after them received.In a conversation with OutKick founder Clay Travis aboard Air Force One, Trump addressed the situation and outlined his plans for upcoming celebrations. ""I look forward to having the [Philadelphia Eagles],"" Trump stated, adding, ""And one other thing, we're going to have the Kansas City Chiefs after that because they missed their turn because of COVID."" The Chiefs, who recently suffered a heavy defeat against the Eagles in Super Bowl LIX, are yet to publicly comment on the invitation, but the possibility of finally closing this chapter in their franchise history remains on the table.The announcement adds an interesting dimension given the political backdrop surrounding key figures within the Chiefs organization. Travis Kelce, who is in a highly publicized relationship with pop superstar Taylor Swift, finds himself at the center of intrigue. Swift was an outspoken critic of Trump in the lead-up to the 2024 election, openly endorsing Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party. Kelce, on the other hand, maintained a neutral stance on political matters, emphasizing his excitement about the game itself when asked about Trump’s attendance at the Super Bowl. ""That's awesome. It's a great honor,"" Kelce said at the time. ""I think, you know, no matter who the president is, I know I'm excited because it's the biggest game of my life.""Trump's admiration for the Mahomes family also adds another layer to the story. The former president has been vocal about his appreciation for quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ mother, Randi, and his wife, Brittany. ""I love those two women. They're so great and so loyal. I met Patrick's mother... at the game [the Super Bowl],"" Trump remarked. ""She came over. And Brittany, I've seen so much of Brittany that just, you know, being so loyal and great and beautiful.""The Chiefs’ previous White House visits came under President Joe Biden in 2023 and 2024 after their consecutive Super Bowl victories. Now, under a different administration, the dynamics surrounding their potential visit introduce an element of curiosity and speculation. If they do accept Trump’s invitation, the event will undoubtedly generate significant public and media attention.Also Read: ""My heart goes out to you!”: Donna Kelce shares heartfelt message to Kylie Kelce after tragic loss As of now, no official date has been set for the Chiefs’ White House visit, and the team has yet to publicly confirm their acceptance of Trump’s invitation. With many eyes on how the players, particularly Kelce, will navigate this political landscape, the visit—if it takes place—will be more than just a sports celebration. It will be a moment of historical reflection, political undertones, and perhaps, a testament to the unifying power of sports despite personal and ideological differences.","Kansas City Chiefs are set to receive a long-overdue honor as former President Donald Trump has extended an invitation to celebrate their Super Bowl LIV victory at the White House.

Northville coach fired after controversial incident

Brett Favre applauds the school’s swift action

A shocking incident in high school basketball has sparked widespread outrage, with former Northville coach Jim Zullo fired for grabbing a player’s ponytail after a championship loss. NFL legend Brett Favre weighed in, applauding the school's swift action.During the New York Class D state championship game, Northville suffered a tough loss to La Fargeville. However, what happened after the game became an even bigger story.As the players walked off the court, Jim Zullo was caught on video grabbing senior player Hailey Monroe by her ponytail. The footage quickly went viral, sparking outrage from the public and sports figures alike.In response to the backlash, Northville School District released a statement emphasizing that they are taking the matter seriously and will be following up with the affected players and their families.""We assure the public that this matter is being taken extremely seriously, and the District is actively addressing it. The District will be following up with the affected players and their families to provide support and outline the actions we are taking in response to this incident.""Among those who reacted strongly to the situation was NFL Hall-of-Famer Brett Favre, who took to X (formerly Twitter) to voice his disapproval. ""This one really surprised me. No room for this, and good on the school for acting quickly,"" Favre posted.Zullo later defended his actions, claiming that Monroe had directed an expletive at him after he told her to shake hands with the opposing team. However, this explanation did little to change the public’s perception of the incident.The swift firing of Zullo signals the school district’s zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate behavior toward student-athletes.In a separate controversy involving Brett Favre, former New York Jets defensive end Mark Gastineau has filed a $25-million lawsuit against ESPN for using footage of his confrontation with Favre without permission.The encounter, which took place at the Chicago Sports Spectacular event in 2023, stemmed from a long-standing grievance. Gastineau confronted Favre over an infamous moment in 2001, when Favre seemingly took a dive to allow Michael Strahan to break Gastineau’s single-season sack record.Also Read: ""You can't stop me"": Kylie Kelce reveals bold plan to induce labor by running sprints at 38 weeks pregnant with baby No. 4 The footage of this heated exchange was later featured in ESPN's 30 for 30 documentary, The New York Sack Exchange.

As of now, ESPN has not commented on the lawsuit.","High school basketball coach Jim Zullo was fired for grabbing a player's ponytail after a championship loss.

Erin Andrews on managing a hectic career while adjusting to the realities of motherhood

Episode 312: CAN YOU GIVE ME A MINUTE?! | Calm Down Podcast

Erin Andrews on juggling a successful broadcasting career, a growing business, and motherhood

Renowned sports broadcaster Erin Andrews is no stranger to navigating a demanding career while balancing personal responsibilities. However, during a recent episode of the Calm Down podcast, Andrews got emotional as she reflected on what she described as an incredibly difficult year juggling work, motherhood, and her personal life.As a veteran Fox Sports reporter, Andrews has spent years covering the NFL with relentless dedication. But now, as a mother to nearly 2-year-old Mack—whom she shares with husband and former NHL player Jarret Stoll—she’s finding that the demands of her career and family life are harder to balance than ever.“It’s really hard, it really is,” Erin Andrews admitted during a live taping of her podcast with co-host Charissa Thompson. “My better half [Stoll] works in the hockey world, and so his season is going on at the same time. This was a really, really hard year. I’m going to get emotional about it.”Andrews recalled that during Mack’s first year as a newborn, it was easier to leave for work. But now, as he grows older and more aware of her departures, the emotional toll has increased. “I had this attitude like, ‘I have this career and this is how it’s going to be.’ And then he starts talking and realizing you’re leaving, and it was just really, really hard.”Beyond her broadcasting career, Andrews is also deeply involved in her clothing line, WEAR by Erin Andrews, making her schedule even more demanding. She shared how she often felt like she wasn’t giving enough to any aspect of her life.“I would just have multiple meltdowns with Charissa saying, ‘I feel like I’m not giving 100 percent of myself to my son, or my job, or my clothing line, and I feel like I am barely above water,’” Andrews revealed. “And then your relationships start to suffer.”She admitted that the intensity of the football season kept her from seeing friends and maintaining personal connections. Once the season ended, she looked back and thought, “I don’t know… excuse me, how the f–k I did that.”Reflecting on the past year, Andrews recognized the need to be kinder to herself. “I need to go easier on myself, and I’ve realized that. I was so worried I wasn’t giving all of myself to both things that I was doing the best I could, and everybody’s fine. I just need to give myself a little grace.”Her openness about the struggles of working motherhood resonates with many, especially those juggling high-pressure careers with raising children. As she moves into the next NFL season, Andrews hopes to apply the lessons she’s learned, prioritizing balance and self-compassion.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s iHeartRadio speech hides a secret—Fans think they’ve uncovered it Her journey, marked by resilience and honesty, continues to inspire, proving that even the most accomplished women face the challenge of finding harmony between career and family.","Erin Andrews is a veteran Fox Sports reporter and mother to nearly 2-year-old Mack.

Sunrisers Hyderabad:

Rajasthan Royals:

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) will start as favourites against Rajasthan Royals (RR) in their opening Indian Premier League (IPL) match at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Sunday. Armed with a balanced squad featuring powerful hitters like Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan and Heinrich Klaasen, SRH are well-equipped to post a massive total on the batting-friendly track. The return of all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy after injury adds more depth to their lineup.Abhishek Sharma’s recent form is a significant boost, as he smashed 135 off just 54 balls against England in his last T20I appearance. With such explosive capabilities, SRH could potentially set the much-anticipated 300-run record if they bat first. Last season, they breached the 250-run mark thrice, including 287 against Royal Challengers Bangalore and 277 versus Mumbai Indians.Captain Pat Cummins and Mohammed Shami lead SRH’s experienced pace attack, supported by spinner Adam Zampa. In contrast, Rajasthan Royals look underwhelming, especially without their captain Sanju Samson, who is nursing a finger injury. Riyan Parag will lead in Samson’s absence, but the Royals’ bowling lacks depth beyond Jofra Archer.SRH dominated both encounters with RR last season, winning narrowly in the league stage and comfortably in Qualifier 2. With momentum and firepower on their side, SRH appear poised to continue their dominance.The match between Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Rajasthan Royals (RR) will take place at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad.The highly anticipated clash is scheduled for Sunday, March 23.The match will begin at 3:30 PM IST, with the toss at 3:00 PM IST.The match will be broadcast live on the JioStar Network.Fans in India can stream the match live on the JioHotstar app.Pat Cummins (c), Travis Head, Ishan Kishan, Heinrich Klaasen, Abhishek Sharma, Sachin Baby, Mohammed Shami, Adam Zampa, Aniket Verma, Abhinav Manohar, Rahul Chahar, Eshan Malinga, Harshal Patel, Kamindu Mendis, Wiaan Mulder, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Atharva Taide, Brydon Carse, Simarjeet Singh, Jaydev Unadkat, Zeeshan Ansari.Riyan Parag (c), Sanju Samson, Shubham Dubey, Shimron Hetmyer, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Dhruv Jurel, Nitish Rana, Kunal Singh Rathore, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Wanindu Hasaranga, Jofra Archer, Ashok Sharma, Tushar Deshpande, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Kumar Kartikeya, Akash Madhwal, Kwena Maphaka, Sandeep Sharma, Maheesh Theekshana, Yudhvir Singh.","Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) will start as favourites against Rajasthan Royals (RR) in their opening Indian Premier League (IPL) match at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.

Sunrisers Hyderabad will open their campaign against Rajasthan Royals in the second match of the Indian Premier League season 18 today. It is the first double-header of IPL 2025 with the evening fixture taking place at Chepauk between Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians. Before that, though, the focus will be on the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.Sunrisers have some of the most explosive batters in their line-up in Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan and Heinrich Klaasen, and with a belter of a track likely to offer, they would fancy a massive total in the afternoon match.Sunrisers posted 250-plus totals three times last season, including 287 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru in an away match and 277 against Mumbai Indians at home. The explosive duo of Abhishek and Head scored the highest IPL powerplay total of 125 against Delhi Capitals in the third instance when they posted 266.In fact, if any team can get to the much talked about 300-run total after batting first, it is Sunrisers that is expected to achieve the feat with the firepower they have.Rajasthan are under new leadership with Riyan Parag having been named as the stand-in captain for the first three matches as full-time skipper Sanju Samson is still recovering from an injury.Samson, though not cleared to wicketkeeper or field yet, can still play a part as a specialist batter.The batting-friendly pitches at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium produced explosive hitting last season. With Sunrisers retaining their core power-hitters and Rajasthan fielding a formidable top order, fans can brace for another high-scoring spectacle. This ground has been a record-breaking arena over the past year, and more fireworks seem inevitable.SRH Predicted Playing XI: Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Ishan Kishan, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen, Abhinav Manohar, Sachin Baby/Aniket Verma, Pat Cummins, Harshal Patel, Adam Zampa, Mohammed Shami.Impact Sub: Rahul Chahar/Jaydev Unadkat.RR Predicted Playing XI: Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, Nitish Rana, Riyan Parag, Shimron Hetmyer, Dhruv Jurel (wk), Shubham Dubey, Wanindu Hasaranga, Jofra Archer, Sandeep Sharma, Fazalhaq Farooqi.Impact Sub: Kumar Kartikeya/Tushar Deshpande.Sunrisers Hyderabad: Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Ishan Kishan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen(w), Abhinav Manohar, Sachin Baby, Pat Cummins(c), Harshal Patel, Adam Zampa, Mohammed Shami, Rahul Chahar, Jaydev Unadkat, Kamindu Mendis, Zeeshan Ansari, Wiaan Mulder, Atharva Taide, Simarjeet Singh, Eshan Malinga, Aniket Verma.Rajasthan Royals: Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, Nitish Rana, Riyan Parag(c), Shimron Hetmyer, Dhruv Jurel(w), Shubham Dubey, Wanindu Hasaranga, Jofra Archer, Tushar Deshpande, Sandeep Sharma, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Kumar Kartikeya, Akash Madhwal, Yudhvir Singh Charak, Maheesh Theekshana, Kwena Maphaka, Ashok Sharma, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Kunal Singh Rathore.Sunrisers Hyderabad and Rajasthan Royals have squared off 20 times in IPL history.

How do Alex Albon and Lily Muni He Keep their relationship strong while always on the move?

Alex Albon and Lily Muni He didn’t meet in some grand, star-studded way. There was no encounter at a glamorous event, no mutual friends setting them up. Instead, it all started the way plenty of modern relationships do—on social media.Back in 2019, Lily, a professional golfer , was just starting to get into Formula 1 . She had always loved cars, butpulled her into the sport, and soon, she was following a few drivers, including Alex. Meanwhile, Alex had been getting into golf himself. Before long, they took notice of each other and started talking. Then came a trip to L.A., a round of golf, and the beginning of what would become one of F1 ’s most well-known relationships.Lily was born in Chengdu , China, in 1999, but her family moved around quite a bit—first to Vancouver, then to San Diego. By the time she was five, she had a golf club in her hands, and she never really put it down. She turned professional as a teenager and earned her LPGA Tour membership in 2020, but she also sacrificed a lot to get there.“It was difficult growing up being a student athlete ,” she told. “I only had so much time in the day and I tried my best to balance everything.”That kind of dedication is something she and Alex understand about each other. “On top of everything, we understand and we get each other,” Alex told Golfweek. “The highs and lows of being an athlete, I think you can resonate that with any athlete.”Being in a relationship with a professional athlete means spending a lot of time apart, but Alex and Lily have figured out how to make it work. They support each other’s careers, give each other space when needed, and even found a creative way to stay connected—virtual reality golf.“I’m still losing, but I’m losing less,” Alex joked toin 2023.Also Read: The future of women in F1: Will we See a female driver in formula 1 soon?

Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc disqualified from Chinese GP in Ferrari’s latest Formula 1 heartbreak



The Chinese Grand Prix delivered a shocking twist as Ferrari ’s Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton , along with Alpine’s Pierre Gasly, were disqualified for technical infringements. The post-race scrutiny revealed that their cars failed to meet FIA regulations, leading to a major shake-up in the final race classification.During the routine post-race checks, Leclerc and Gasly’s cars were found to weigh 799kg after fuel removal—1kg below the minimum weight requirement. In Leclerc’s case, a damaged front wing had been replaced with a spare during weighing, yet the final measurement still fell short. FIA delegate Jo Bauer noted, “The car was weighed again on the FIA scales (with the official spare front wing assembly of car 16) and the weight was 799.0kg.” This breach of Article 4.1 left no room for mitigation, leading to an immediate referral to the stewards.Hamilton’s disqualification, on the other hand, stemmed from excessive wear on his car’s underbody skid block. Measurements showed the rearmost skid block had worn below the minimum 9mm thickness, registering values between 8.5mm and 8.6mm. The FIA’s report clarified, “The recorded measurement was 8.6mm (LHS), 8.6mm (car centerline) and 8.5mm (RHS).” As a result, Hamilton’s car was deemed non-compliant under Article 3.5.9, sealing his disqualification.Ferrari’s hopes for a strong finish in Shanghai were crushed as both Hamilton and Leclerc lost their hard-earned fifth and sixth places, stripping them of 18 crucial points. While Gasly had finished outside the top ten in 11th, his disqualification added to Alpine’s woes.Interestingly, this is not the first time Hamilton and Leclerc have faced such setbacks. The 2023 United States Grand Prix saw both drivers disqualified for excessive skid wear, further underscoring the fine margins in modern Formula 1 regulations.The race had already been eventful for Ferrari, with Hamilton and Leclerc making contact on the opening lap. The minor clash resulted in damage to Leclerc’s front wing, yet he managed to maintain competitive pace throughout the 56-lap race. Oddly, despite the damage, he displayed superior speed, prompting Ferrari to instruct Hamilton to yield position midway through the race.Leclerc later dismissed the incident, stating, “Honestly, it’s not Lewis’s fault at all… It’s a racing incident, it’s not the first or last time it will happen.” His refusal to change the damaged wing at the pit stop was a calculated gamble, as he explained, “We didn’t want to take the eight seconds to change the wing, didn’t want to take that risk.”With Hamilton, Leclerc, and Gasly’s results nullified, Esteban Ocon surged to a surprising fifth-place finish for Haas. Andrea Kimi Antonelli, Alex Albon, and Oliver Bearman gained valuable positions, while Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll and Williams’ Carlos Sainz moved into the final points-paying spots.Also Read: Emotional tribute to Eddie Jordan brought F1 family together at Chinese Grand Prix This unexpected outcome has delivered a significant blow to Ferrari’s championship ambitions early in the 2025 season. Meanwhile, Alpine will be left reeling from yet another setback. As the F1 circus moves forward, teams will be under immense pressure to ensure full compliance with FIA regulations to avoid similar heartbreaks.","Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc disqualified from Chinese GP in Ferrari’s latest Formula 1 heartbreak.

NEW DELHI: On a day when Rohit Sharma became the second-most capped player in Indian Premier League (IPL) history, he also etched his name into an unwanted record.In Mumbai Indians' season opener against Chennai Super Kings at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Sunday, Rohit was dismissed for a four-ball duck by pacer Khaleel Ahmed in the very first over.This dismissal marked Rohit’s 18th duck in the IPL, equalling the dubious record held by Dinesh Karthik and Glenn Maxwell for the most ducks in the tournament's history.The dismissal also marked Rohit’s first T20 outing since India’s T20 World Cup 2024 final against South Africa in Barbados. Despite his personal setback, the milestone of becoming the second-most capped player in IPL history was a significant achievement. Making his 258th appearance, Rohit surpassed Dinesh Karthik (257 matches) and now trails only MS Dhoni, who leads with 265 IPL appearances.Rohit’s IPL journey began in 2008 with Deccan Chargers before he became the face of Mumbai Indians, leading them to a record five IPL titles. Over 17 seasons, he has accumulated 6,628 runs, including two centuries, and has maintained a solid average of 29.72.

NEW DELHI: In a moment that lit up Chepauk and sent social media into a frenzy, MS Dhoni once again proved why age is just a number.The 43-year-old wicketkeeper pulled off a stunning stumping to dismiss Mumbai Indians ’ captain Suryakumar Yadav , leaving fans and commentators in awe of his reflexes and presence behind the stumps.The dismissal came in the 11th over of MI’s innings when Suryakumar looked to up the ante against debutant spinner Noor Ahmad.Trying to take on the left-arm wrist-spinner with an ambitious inside-out lofted drive, SKY was beaten in the flight.The ball spun away sharply, and before his bat could even complete its arc, Dhoni had already whipped the bails off with a swift, textbook gather and a sharp forward push -- hallmarks of his legendary glovework.Watch:Suryakumar's 29-run stay was ended in a flash, and Dhoni’s magic had once again turned the tide.The stumping wasn’t just quick; it was clinical, cold, and classic Dhoni. It also gave Noor Ahmad his maiden wicket for CSK, making it even more special.The wicket proved pivotal as Mumbai, who had started recovering from an early collapse, lost momentum.CSK’s bowling unit, led by Noor Ahmad’s 4/18 and Khaleel Ahmed’s fiery 3/29, kept the pressure on.Tilak Varma (31) offered brief resistance, but the Super Kings tightened the screws through the middle overs.Despite a late cameo from Deepak Chahar (28* off 15), Mumbai Indians managed just 155/9 in their 20 overs.While Noor's dream debut and Khaleel’s powerplay strikes were standout moments, Dhoni’s stumping stole the show.It was a reminder that no matter how fast the game moves, MS Dhoni still moves faster -- and when he does, something special always happens.",MS Dhoni pulls off a stunning stumping to dismiss Mumbai Indians’ captain Suryakumar Yadav.

IPL 2025: How will KKR, MI, CSK, SRH, RCB fare this season?

Mumbai Indians: 155 for 9 in 20 overs

Chennai Super Kings: 158 for 6 in 19.1 overs

In a thrilling debut for Chennai Super Kings , Afghanistan mystery spinner Noor Ahmad showcased his talent by taking four wickets, helping the team secure a four-wicket victory over their arch-rivals, the Mumbai Indians , in the Indian Premier League on Sunday. After CSK opted to bowl first on a slow pitch, Ahmad's impressive performance restricted Mumbai to a modest total of 155/9.CSK's captain Ruturaj Gaikwad contributed significantly, scoring a brilliant 53 runs off just 26 balls while batting at number three, instead of his usual opening position alongside Rachin Ravindra. Ravindra later played a crucial role, finishing the match with an unbeaten 65 off 45 balls to guide CSK home in 19.1 overs.IPL debutant Vignesh Puthur, a left-arm spinner from Kerala, made a remarkable impact despite having no prior experience in senior cricket. He claimed 3/32, taking down Gaikwad, Shivam Dube, and Deepak Hooda in quick succession, putting CSK under pressure as none of the batsmen could effectively tackle the rookie spinner.Ravindra brought excitement to the crowd by hitting a couple of sixes off Puthur towards the end. The atmosphere peaked when M. S. Dhoni came to bat with just four runs needed, but it was Ravindra who sealed the victory with a six.With this loss, the Mumbai Indians continued their unfortunate streak of failing to win their opening match of the IPL since 2012..

As it happened:

NEW DELHI: Afghanistan's mystery spinner Noor Ahmad made an unforgettable debut for Chennai Super Kings (CSK), claiming a sensational four-wicket haul to script a memorable four-wicket win over Mumbai Indians (MI) in their IPL 2025 opener at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai, on Sunday.Ahmad’s figures of 4 for 18 were not only the best by any CSK spinner against MI but also pivotal in restricting the visitors to a modest 155/9 on a typically slow Chepauk surface.In a match that continued MI's unfortunate streak of not winning their opening game since 2012, Noor Ahmad was the undeniable game-changer. His spell broke the backbone of MI's batting, leaving them struggling to gain any momentum. After Khaleel Ahmed (3/29) struck early by dismissing Rohit Sharma for a duck and Ryan Rickelton for 13, Ahmad took over the middle overs with his deceptive variations.The highlight of Ahmad’s spell came when he dismissed MI's stand-in captain Suryakumar Yadav (29 off 26) with a lightning-quick stumping by MS Dhoni , who showcased his evergreen reflexes behind the stumps. Dhoni’s brilliance not only highlighted his continued prowess but also underlined Ahmad’s skill to fox the batter with a well-disguised delivery.Ahmad followed it up by trapping Tilak Varma (31 off 25) with a googly and dismissing Robin Minz and Naman Dhir in quick succession. The MI middle-order was left in tatters as Ahmad's wizardry spun them into disarray.Despite Deepak Chahar’s late resistance with a fiery 28 off 15 balls, MI could only muster 155/9, a total that never looked threatening.Chasing 156, CSK got off to a steady start, anchored by skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad, who smashed 53 off 26 balls before falling to IPL debutant Vignesh Puthur (3/32). Puthur briefly troubled CSK with his left-arm spin, removing Gaikwad, Shivam Dube and Deepak Hooda in quick succession. However, Rachin Ravindra’s unbeaten 65 off 45 balls ensured CSK’s march towards victory.The crowd erupted when MS Dhoni walked out to bat with just four runs needed, but it was Ravindra who sealed the win with a towering six, as CSK reached the target in 19.1 overs.With this victory, CSK extended their dominance over MI, having won six of the last seven head-to-head encounters since the second leg of IPL 2021.","Chennai Super Kings (CSK) beat Mumbai Indians (MI) by four wickets in their IPL 2025 opener at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai, on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Batter Ishan Kishan announced his arrival at Sunrisers Hyderabad in style on Sunday, smashing his maiden IPL century for the Men in Orange in just 45 balls to spearhead a breathtaking assault on Rajasthan Royals On a day when nearly every batter found rhythm, it was Kishan who stood tallest, turning the spotlight firmly on himself with a power-packed performance that helped SRH post a towering 286/6 -- just one short of their own record for the highest total in IPL history .Walking in after a fiery opening stand between Travis Head (67 off 31) and Abhishek Sharma (24 off 11), Kishan made his intentions clear from the get-go.He blended timing with brute force, taking apart the Royals' bowling, especially England’s Jofra Archer , whose four-over spell leaked a staggering 76 runs -- the most expensive in IPL history.Kishan’s 85-run partnership with Head laid the perfect platform before he switched gears, peppering the field with boundaries and bringing up his century with a mix of finesse and fearless hitting.With 34 fours and 12 sixes in the innings, SRH’s batting blitz was nothing short of historic.Though Rajasthan Royals mounted a spirited chase with Sanju Samson (66) and Dhruv Jurel (70) stitching together a 111-run stand, Kishan’s ton had already put the result beyond doubt.Despite a late flurry from Hetmyer and Dubey, the Royals fell short by 44 runs.For Kishan, this was more than just a century.

As Delhi Capitals (DC) and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) prepare to clash in their opening Indian Premier League 2025 match on Monday, both teams face fresh challenges under new leadership and revamped squads. The Dr YS Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Stadium will host the encounter as DC’s temporary home venue for two matches this season.One of the most anticipated storylines is Rishabh Pant ’s move to LSG for a staggering Rs 27 crore during the mega auction. Having been benched during the recent Champions Trophy, this IPL season serves as a crucial opportunity for Pant to showcase his white-ball prowess.On the other hand, KL Rahul , who previously led LSG for two seasons, has transitioned to DC, taking on the role of a key batter rather than captain. Instead, the leadership mantle has been passed to Axar Patel , despite the presence of experienced candidates like Faf du Plessis.DC boasts a balanced lineup featuring the experience of du Plessis and the pace of Mitchell Starc , who recently joined after missing the Champions Trophy. The middle order looks formidable with the likes of Karun Nair, Tristan Stubbs, Sameer Rizvi, Ashutosh Sharma, and Rahul. The bowling unit is equally strong, with spin spearheaded by Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav, while pacers T Natarajan, Mohit Sharma, Mukesh Kumar, and Dushmantha Chameera add depth.LSG, meanwhile, relies on domestic talent alongside overseas stars such as Mitchell Marsh, David Miller, Aiden Markram, and Nicholas Pooran. The team faces challenges with limited overseas availability and Indian pacers Mayank Yadav, Avesh Khan, and Akash Deep currently in rehabilitation.Shardul Thakur bolsters LSG’s bowling strength following his impressive Ranji Trophy performances, replacing the injured Mohsin Khan. Additionally, Rajvardhan Hangargekar and Ravi Bishnoi are expected to play key roles in the pace and spin departments, respectively.With both teams aiming to establish momentum early in the tournament, the clash between DC and LSG promises to be an exciting and unpredictable battle.",Delhi Capitals (DC) and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) prepare to clash in their opening Indian Premier League 2025 match on Monday.

forwardis set to return to Miami for the first time since his dramatic exit from the Heat following his recent mid-season trade. His highly anticipated comeback game on Tuesday has stirred plenty of emotions among fans, but for Butler, it’s simply business as usual. Butler’s beef with the Heat management was in the headlines multiple times as he faced several suspensions just in a month in the final days of his time with the team. Jimmy Butler ’s final days in the Miami Heat were nothing but a sort of disdained back-and-forth clash as the veteran NBA star continuously pushed for the trade. He had three major suspensions for multiple games in a month but he was still determined to stand for his voice to leave the organization. When asked if he still reflects on his time in Miami, Butler gave a blunt response.“I was traded from there, yada, yada, yada…Yeah, it didn’t end the way people wanted it to, yada, yada, yada. But that’s so far behind me now. I don’t even think about it. I don’t pay attention to nothing except for the trajectory of this squad,” Butler told ESPN.Butler has fully embraced his new role at the Golden State Warriors. Since joining the Warriors in early February, the team has thrived with him in the lineup, posting an impressive 16-3 record. While Stephen Curry remains the heart of the team, Butler, alongside Draymond Green, has brought an edge to both ends of the floor. Over the last four games, Butler has averaged over 16 points per game alongside his strong defense.He seamlessly fit into Steve Kerr’s system, helping the Warriors stay competitive in the tightly contested Western Conference. However, his upcoming matchup against Miami is one that fans and analysts have been circling on the calendar.Butler, however, isn’t dwelling on the past. After the Warriors’ recent loss to the Atlanta Hawks, he made it clear his focus is on securing another win, regardless of the opponent.“It’s just another game for me. Another game we’re expected to win, for sure,” Butler said. “I love the Miami fan base, but right now, I’m here to win. I’m on the opposing team.”Also Read: Jimmy Butler steps up to lead Golden State Warriors after Stephen Curry Injury: ""That's just more perfect basketball that we're going to have to play"" Miami has struggled since Butler’s departure, holding a 4-17 record since the trade. As Butler steps onto the Heat’s home court in a Warriors jersey for the first time, all eyes will be on how he performs and how Miami fans react to the highly anticipated match-up.","Jimmy Butler is set to return to Miami for the first time since his dramatic exit from the Heat following his mid-season trade.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals pacer Jofra Archer etched his name into the Indian Premier League (IPL) history books for the wrong reasons as he delivered the most expensive spell in the tournament’s history during his side’s 2025 season opener against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Sunday.The English speedster was hammered for a staggering 76 runs in his four-over spell at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.Archer’s forgettable performance broke the previous record held by Mohit Sharma, who conceded 73 runs in four overs for Gujarat Titans against Delhi Capitals in 2024. Before that, Basil Thampi had given away 70 runs in his spell for Sunrisers Hyderabad against Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2018. Archer now tops the unenviable list of the most expensive spells in IPL history .The disastrous outing began right from Archer’s first over during the PowerPlay, where Travis Head took charge and smashed the bowler for 23 runs. The onslaught included four boundaries and a towering six, setting the tone for what would become a historic drubbing.Archer’s subsequent overs fared no better, as Sunrisers Hyderabad’s batters displayed relentless aggression. By the end of his quota, Archer had leaked 76 runs without taking a single wicket. This record-breaking spell left the Royals reeling, as they failed to contain the explosive batting display from the hosts.Sunrisers Hyderabad continued their ruthless assault, amassing a mammoth total of 286 for 6 in 20 overs. This became the second-highest team total in IPL history, only behind their own record of 287 for 3 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru in 2024. Ishan Kishan led the charge with a blistering century off just 45 deliveries, while Travis Head, Nitish Kumar Reddy, and Heinrich Klaasen contributed with quickfire knocks, following the same aggressive template.The Royals’ bowling unit had no answers to the SRH batting onslaught. Apart from Tushar Deshpande, who managed to concede less than 50 runs in his full quota, the rest of the bowlers faced a merciless assault.","Jofra Archer gives away 76 runs in four overs in Rajasthan Royals' 2025 season opener against Sunrisers Hyderabad.

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad displayed a jaw-dropping power-hitting spree in IPL 2025 by posting a staggering 286/6 against Rajasthan Royals on Sunday.This was the second-highest total in IPL history and their own second-best as well. This explosive performance comes hot on the heels of their record-breaking 287/3 against RCB last season.Opening the innings, Abhishek Sharma wasted no time setting the tone, hammering 24 off just 11 balls.Travis Head followed up with a brutal 67 off 31, featuring nine fours and three sixes.But the real carnage came from Ishan Kishan, who lit up the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium with a sensational 106 not out off 47 balls, striking 11 fours and six sixes at a jaw-dropping strike rate of 225.53.Supporting knocks from Nitish Kumar Reddy (30 off 15) and Heinrich Klaasen (34 off 14) ensured SRH never lost momentum.Even as wickets fell in the death overs, the scoreboard kept ticking, with SRH smashing 94 runs in the powerplay and finishing just one run short of their own all-time IPL record.Rajasthan Royals’ bowling unit found no answers. Jofra Archer bore the brunt of the onslaught, conceding a brutal 76 in his four overs -- the most expensive spell of the day. Tushar Deshpande was the only bowler to escape somewhat unscathed, picking up 3 for 44.This is now SRH’s fourth 260+ total in the last two IPL seasons, underlining their transformation into the league’s most fearsome batting unit.Chasing 287 is virtually uncharted territory, but RR will need to go all guns blazing. With a lightning-fast outfield and plenty of firepower in their ranks, the Royals have no option but to swing for the fences.","Sunrisers Hyderabad post second-highest total in IPL history.

MI in IPL 2025: After wooden spoon, Mumbai Indians target better show

IPL 2025: How will KKR, MI, CSK, SRH, RCB fare this season?

TimesofIndia.com in Chennai: Four players made their Indian Premier League debut in the Chennai Super Kings vs Mumbai Indians clash at Chepauk on Sunday but it was the little-known Vignesh Puthur who made a splash in front of a packed house. The 24-year-old chinaman bowler , son of an auto driver, from Malappuram in Kerala was the latest dispatch from MI's scouting stable, and the youngster made instant impact with 3/32 against a star-studded CSK outfit.Puthur's journey to MI's blue and gold is a fascinating one as he was picked up at the auction for Rs 30 lakh after an impressive show in the franchise's trials. Amongst the many who had assembled, Puthur caught the attention with his accuracy, consistent turn and ability to keep a cool head under pressure. It was enough to raise the paddle and from there on, the management chalked out a plan to groom the inexperienced spinner who had very little exposure at the higher level.The MI Cape Town unit was set to assemble in South Africa for the SA20 in January and Puthur was summoned as a net bowler and spent a lot of time working on his skills with the likes of Rashid Khan. The invaluable experience of rubbing shoulders with the greats of the game did his confidence a world of good and he even played three games for the Reliance team in the DY Patil T20 tournament before the pre-season preparations got underway.In the nets, during match simulations and practice fixtures, the management led by head coach Mahela Jayawardene were convinced to give the boy an early chance in the IPL and feedback from Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav also pushed his case.""Rohit, Surya, Tillak, all these guys batted against him (in the nets)... it wasn't easy that easy (to pick him). So one of the reasons we felt that we have the confidence of pushing him in this game. And it turned out to be excellent. It was a good decision,"" said MI bowling coach Paras Mhambrey .He lavished praise on the scouting team, who unearthed Puthur from the Kerala Cricket League, for unearthing a talent like him and further explained what they look for when picking these youngsters.""We have good guys who can spot talent. I think the idea with MI is seeing the potential more than anything else. And when we saw him for one of our trials, we saw the potential in him. Rather than looking into how much cricket he's played in the past. But it's purely thought that he has the potential. And you saw that today,"" added Mhambrey.Amidst deafening whistles and chants, Puthur returned with the wickets of Ruturaj Gaikwad, Shivam Dube and Deepak Hooda but what impressed the MI dugout the most was his ability to hold nerves and handle the pressure. It was something they had worked on behind the scenes and the regular conversations with coaches Mahela, Kieron Pollard and senior players like Rohit helped Puthur understand his role, expectations of the team and the culture of the MI dressing room.""Yes, he hasn't played much cricket. But we got an opportunity where he worked a little bit. Got an opportunity to work with him after we had a couple of trials. Not purely on the skill work so much really. I think that he is pretty much sorted out there I feel. But more about the conversations that he had an opportunity with MJ. Or Pollard. Or the batters, especially Surya and Rohit. I think that really helped with him in understanding the requirements. And understanding his role in the team. And what we expect out of him,"" explained Mhambrey.Sharing the dressing room with India and overseas stars, having a post-match chat with MS Dhoni is the stuff dreams are made of, and Puthur lived that on Sunday night. The social media traction sky-rocketed in lightning quick time but the bowling coach asserts he is a ""sweet kid"" just soaking it all in ""like a sponge"".""He's a lovely kid to have in the team. He's more like a sponge right now, just absorbing everything, looking around, you know, having conversations. I thought not everyone gets an opportunity in a dressing room to get an opportunity to chat with MJ, someone who has so much experience. Surya, Tilak, Rohit, you know, all these guys. He's just listening.""You have heroes, you see them playing on the TV, and all of a sudden you're sharing that dressing room with them, sitting next to someone like Rohit. It's a dream come true for a lot of these guys, right? But purely the way he responded... never looked like he was under pressure from the very first ball. And that was good to see,"" says Mhambrey.The first impression has been a good one and now everyone in the MI dugout would hope it turns out to be a long and successful innings like their previous boy wonders - Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Krunal Pandya, Tilak Varma - who went on to become household names.",Vignesh Puthur made his IPL debut against Chennai Super Kings on Sunday.

He took 3/32 against a star-studded CSK outfit at Chepauk.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119404032,imgsize-137206,width-400,resizemode-4/119404032.jpg"
