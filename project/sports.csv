Ruturaj Gaikwad press conference: Reveals Gautam Gambhir message, No.4 and more

Poll Do you believe Kohli can maintain this form for the upcoming matches? Yes, he can No, it's temporary I'm not sure

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli hasn’t just returned to form — he has set off a nationwide frenzy strong enough to sell out an entire stadium. Back-to-back centuries in Ranchi and Raipur have turned what was shaping up to be a low-interest ODI in Visakhapatnam into the hottest cricket ticket in India this week. According to officials at the Andhra Cricket Association (ACA), Kohli’s stunning run-scoring spree single-handedly reversed sluggish online bookings for the third ODI against South Africa at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Stadium.When tickets first went on sale digitally on November 28, the association braced for a disappointing turnout. The lack of buzz even pushed the ACA towards the rare option of setting up offline ticket counters despite committing to a fully digital system this time. But everything changed the moment Kohli unfurled a spectacular century in Ranchi on November 30. Suddenly, Phase 2 and 3 of ticket sales disappeared in minutes.“The first phase response wasn’t good,” confirmed Y. Venkatesh from ACA’s Media and Operations department to The Indian Express. “After Kohli’s hundred at Ranchi, the second and third phases vanished in minutes. Nothing was left unsold.”It wasn’t just victory that fans chased — it was the chance to witness a phenomenon.Kohli’s numbers in Vizag fuelled the madness: an average of 97.83 in seven ODIs, featuring three centuries and a 99. Even ticket prices ranging from Rs 1,200 to Rs 18,000 couldn’t slow demand.The frenzy spilled into real life, too. Hours before Team India landed in Vizag, hundreds gathered at the airport, waiting through repeated flight delays from Raipur. Security guards were bombarded with one question in multiple languages: “When are they landing?” The answer mattered because Kohli was on board.After his 53rd ODI century in Raipur, cricket legends poured in praise. But the loudest came from Mohammad Kaif, who summed up a nation’s emotion in eight simple words: “Without Kohli cricket is nothing… pure vintage!”","Back-to-back centuries in Ranchi and Raipur have turned what was shaping up to be a low-interest ODI in Visakhapatnam into the hottest cricket ticket in India this week.

The Battle Pakistan Lost To India Days Before 1971 War | I Witness

NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Thursday marked the historic air operations carried out on December 5, the third day of the 1971 war, underscoring how air power proved decisive in shaping the conflict’s outcome and paving the way for India’s victory and the creation of Bangladesh.In a post on X, the IAF recalled its strike on the Sakesar radar station, which crippled Pakistan’s key western air defences for two days.“On the third day of the 1971 war, the IAF was everywhere the enemy looked — and many places where they didn’t expect. Hunters tore through Drigh Road and Karachi, smashing storage hangars. Canberras kept up relentless pressure, delivering 1,44,000 lbs of ordnance across four major airfields,” the post said.The IAF added that 132 missions were flown on the western front, with An-12s and Canberras “raining devastation on enemy concentrations.” On the eastern front, with the Pakistan Air Force effectively grounded, 104 offensive sorties by the IAF cleared the way for the Indian Army’s rapid march into East Pakistan, ultimately leading to the birth of Bangladesh.It also recalled the legendary Battle of Longewala, fought from December 4 to 7, 1971, in Rajasthan’s Longewala sector, where heavily outnumbered Indian troops held their ground against a major Pakistani assault — a defence in which the IAF also played a crucial role.“Four Hunters rewrote history — shattering an enemy armoured thrust and leaving 27 tanks destroyed and 10 more damaged. Jaisalmer stood safe because air power arrived when it mattered,” the post highlighted.The 1971 India–Pakistan war began on December 3 with Pakistan launching pre-emptive strikes on Indian air bases amid the Bangladesh Liberation War in East Pakistan. The conflict ended on December 16 with Pakistan’s defeat, the surrender of 93,000 troops — the largest military capitulation since World War II — and the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent nation.","The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Thursday marked the historic air operations carried out on December 5, the third day of the 1971 war.

was unwell & crying... I’m worried, says her mother

KOLKATA: Birbhum resident Sunali Khatun, nine months and 12 days pregnant, returned to India along with her son, Shabir, 8, on Friday evening, six months after the family’s ordeal began with Delhi Police detaining them as “illegal immigrants”, BSF pushing them into Bangladesh, and authorities there jailing them for illegal entry.Mother and son entered Bengal through the Mahadipur border checkpoint in Malda around 7pm and were received by zilla parishad sabhadhipati Lipika Ghosh and other Trinamool functionaries. Officials took them to Malda Medical College and Hospital, where doctors ran tests to decide when she can travel four-and-a-half hours by road to reach her home in Birbhum.Bangladeshi couple Farooq and Mumtaj Hossain, who hosted Sunali Khatun and her family after they received bail a few days ago, said doctors in Chapai Nawabganj had planned to induce labour. They abandoned the plan when Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) said she needed to be handed over to BSF immediately. Sunali’s husband Danish Sk remains in Bangladesh, awaiting completion of repatriation formalities along with fellow Birbhum resident Sweety Biwi & her two sons.All six were deported on June 26 despite having Aadhaar and other identity documents, their lawyers said. Sunali, Danish and Sweety had been earning a living as ragpickers in Delhi when they were rounded up on June 17 on suspicion of being Bangladeshis living illegally in India.With 26-year-old Sunali’s repatriation getting delayed despite Supreme Court’s Dec 3 directive to govt to ensure her return “during the course of the day”, her counsel had mailed the court’s registry early Friday for an urgent hearing by the bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi.Things began to move around 3.30pm after a BGB team and Indian embassy officials reached Chapai Nawabganj to escort Sunali and her child from the house where they were being kept, till the international border. Rampurhat chief medical officer Sovan De said all possible medical arrangements were made for Sunali’s arrival in Birbhum. Social worker Mofijul Sk, who was in Bangladesh to facilitate her return, said an ambulance would take her from Malda to her home once doctors certified her fit to travel.Sunali’s mother Jyotsna and her daughter Anisha returned to their Birbhum home from Delhi on Friday. Both had travelled to the national capital for the SC hearing on Dec 3. “We boarded a train from Delhi as soon as we were told Sunali was coming back. I am worried about her health. She was feeling unwell and crying when I spoke to her at noon,” Jyotsna said. West Bengal Migrant Welfare Board chairperson Samirul Islam, who led the legal battle for Sunali’s repatriation, wrote on X that her return would be remembered as “a historic moment that exposes the torture and atrocities inflicted on poor Bengalis”.(With inputs from Subhro Maitra in Malda and S Boral in Suri)","Sunali Khatun, nine months and 12 days pregnant, returned to India along with her son, Shabir, 8, on Friday evening.

Wife’s suicide threats amount to mental cruelty: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wifes-suicide-threats-amount-to-mental-cruelty-hc/articleshow/125795968.cms,"Representative image

RAIPUR: The Chhattisgarh high court has observed that a woman’s repeated threats of dying by suicide amounts to mental cruelty towards her husband. Also, attempts at ‘self-harm’ and persistent pressure on the husband to convert his religion, too, amounted to mental cruelty, the court noted.A division bench of Justices Rajani Dubey and Amitendra Kishore Prasad on Thursday made the observations while upholding a family court order that granted divorce to a resident of Balod district in Chhattisgarh. The wife had challenged the June 2024 order.The bench stressed that cruelty isn’t physical alone and can include “conduct causing reasonable apprehension in the petitioner’s mind.”The court noted that the husband had lodged a written complaint with Gurur police station in Balod district on Oct 14, 2019, reporting multiple suicide threats by his wife — including attempts to consume poison, stab herself with knife and set herself ablaze by pouring kerosene. He stated that he lived in constant fear. They were married in May 2018.The bench recorded that in cross-examination, the husband admitted he had left his wife at her parental home because he feared she may harm herself. “The wife’s repeated suicide attempts and threats created a situation of sustained mental harassment for the husband,” the court observed, adding that such conduct “satisfies the legal test of cruelty”.The HC took note of a testimony from a community representative who stated that the wife and her family pressed the husband to adopt Islam, an allegation the appellant denied.The bench found the parties had been living separately since Nov 2019 and the wife did not return despite multiple attempts by the husband and village elders. While the wife argued she always wished to resume cohabitation and the husband sought divorce only after she filed cases under Section 125 CrPC and the Domestic Violence Act, the court held that the overall evidence showed she had deserted him without just cause.",The Chhattisgarh high court observed that a woman’s repeated threats of dying by suicide amounts to mental cruelty towards her husband.

Who Wins This Trade?

has emerged as one of the most realistic trade pathways of the offseason, a move that would instantly upgrade the team’s lineup while giving the Dodgers financial flexibility and roster breathing room. The framework aligns with current trade chatter, where one MLB-ready Braves arm plus 1–2 mid-tier prospects could be enough to bring the veteran slugger to Atlanta.Below is a complete analysis of how the deal works, why both teams would consider it, what Hernández brings on and off the field, and which side would ultimately win the trade.Teoscar Hernández is not a free agent. He is under contract with the Dodgers on a three-year, 66 million dollar deal running through 2027, a structure that includes significant deferred money and a buyout on a 2028 club option. With roughly 33 million owed over the final two years, any transaction is a straight MLB trade.• Los Angeles Dodgers send: Teoscar Hernández (2 years of control, age 33–34 seasons)• Atlanta Braves send: One MLB-ready young starter/swingman; Plus 1–2 mid-tier prospects. Dodgers may include salary relief or take back a small contractThe Braves would use Hernández mainly as a full-time DH and occasional corner outfielder to minimize defensive pressure.The Dodgers, meanwhile, would gain arms, prospect depth, and valuable payroll flexibility as they pursue other outfield targets.Atlanta Braves have spent recent offseasons searching for one specific piece: a middle-of-the-order bat who deepens the lineup behind Ronald Acuña Jr. and Austin Riley. With DH and a rotating corner-outfield spot available, they have room for a true power presence capable of impacting postseason matchups.Teoscar Hernández fits that mold cleanly.• Produced 33 homers, 99 RBI and an .840 OPS in 2024 for the Dodgers• Delivered a .350 average during their 2024 World Series run• Maintains elite hard-hit rate, barrel rate, and power metrics• Hit .284 with an .830 OPS with runners in scoring position in 2025, including .318 and .893 with two outs• Option for immediate lineup protection behind Acuña, Riley, and OlsonEven in his “down” 2025 season, Hernández still hit 25 home runs with 89 RBI in 134 games - easily above-average DH production.For most clubs, trading a 30-plus homer bat makes little sense. For the Dodgers, it aligns with how they manage the long-term roster.• His remaining 33 million dollar obligation affects future payroll planning• They want room for younger, cheaper internal options or a bigger-name outfield acquisition• They aim to preserve payroll space for the rotation and future mega-extensions• Trading him returns controllable pitching and prospects, which their development system thrives onBy moving Hernández now, Los Angeles can redistribute money into pitching, reinforce their depth chart, and maintain flexibility while still competing.Even with fluctuations, his power remains constant, a critical trait for a contender like Atlanta. The 2024 ceiling is the version the Braves believe they can unlock in a hitter-friendly environment.• Age: 33 (entering age-34 and 35 seasons of his contract)• Profile: Right-handed hitter/thrower• Contract: Three years, 66 million; 33 million remaining; includes deferred money and a club option buyoutFor a club firmly in its competitive window, the financial commitment aligns well with Atlanta’s cost-controlled core.• Adds a proven 30-homer bat with postseason success• Ideal DH/corner-outfield fit• Contract size aligns with Atlanta’s win-now approach• Strikeout-prone and streaky at times• Prospect and financial cost reduce flexibility• Defensive limitations require careful handling• Clears a meaningful salary slot• Opens outfield/DH lanes for cheaper or star-level additions• Gains controllable pitching and prospects• Enhances long-term payroll positioning• Loses a power bat instrumental in their 2024 title• Replacement bats must step up immediately• Risk of public backlash if Hernández thrives in AtlantaShort-term, the Braves likely win if Hernández delivers anywhere near his 2024 level. One season of top-tier production during a championship chase is often worth far more than a mid-rotation arm or mid-tier prospects.Long-term, the Dodgers could easily come out ahead if the acquired arms produce value or are flipped into a bigger star. Their front office excels at maximizing these types of deals.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Los Angeles Dodgers predicted to chase $80 Million Chicago Bulls MVP as Michael Conforto filler Either way, the move creates a rare win-now versus long-view dynamic between two contending organizations, the kind of trade rumblings that make December baseball interesting.","Teoscar Hernández is not a free agent.

What a Reunion Would Mean for the Warriors

Themay be eyeing a reunion that would a fan-favorite veteran ahead of the trade deadline. With the franchise looking to sharpen its three-point firepower for the rest of the season, recent speculation suggests the team could target a familiar face: Dallas Mavericks guard Klay Thompson, a four-time NBA champion currently on a $50 million deal.The discussion gained traction after Blue Man Hoop’s Nick San Miguel suggested that Dallas, now in organizational transition, could move on from some of its higher-priced veterans. As Miguel wrote, “With the Mavericks in a state of flux after firing general manager Nico Harrison, it would not be surprising if they traded away some of their pricier players like (Klay) Thompson or Anthony Davis.”Golden State’s intentions have been clear from the moment they signed Seth Curry on Monday. A franchise built on outside shooting needs more consistency from deep, and Curry’s arrival already looks promising.In his first game with the Warriors, the 35-year-old guard delivered 14 points while shooting an impressive 85.7 percent from the field and 66.7 percent from three against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Still, the front office appears to be exploring additional depth options.The Golden State Warriors have rotated through several shooting guards this season, hoping someone would seize the role.Here’s how the current situation stands:Nick San Miguel emphasized this instability, noting, “Golden State has cycled through the shooting guard position this season.” That context opens the door to the possibility of bringing back Thompson, a move that would be both sentimental and strategic. (H/t: Sporting News)Dallas Mavericks’ front office changes have created uncertainty around the roster. Klay Thompson, now 6-foot-5 and 21 games into the season, has delivered a mix of high-ceiling performances and off nights that have raised questions about his consistency.His performances have ranged widely, with games where he “set the nets on fire” and others where he “looked washed-up in every aspect of the game.” That unpredictability makes him a gamble=, but one the Warriors may feel is worthwhile.Bringing Klay Thompson back would tap into a decade of history. The Golden State Warriors’ four championships with Stephen Curry all came with Thompson by his side. While his current form is less reliable, the franchise might view the reunion as a chance to recapture some of that magic as Curry’s career winds down.• Familiarity with Steve Kerr’s system• Deep playoff experience• Ability to stretch the floor• Potential second-unit scoring sparkEven with concerns about consistency, Thompson’s long-range resume remains elite. If he can rediscover rhythm in a familiar environment, he could become a valuable contributor for a team still chasing another title in the Curry era.If Golden State does pursue a trade, expectations would need to be tempered. Thompson is no longer the 20-point scorer he once was, but his shooting gravity and veteran presence could elevate a second unit that has lacked stability.The move would also carry emotional weight. For fans, players, and even the organization, welcoming Thompson back would feel like closing a circle—one more run with a core that defined an era of NBA basketball.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to land $186 million Milwaukee Bucks superstar to form Big 3 with LeBron James and Luka Doncic As of now, it remains speculation, but the idea is no longer far-fetched. The Warriors want shooting, the Mavericks may be recalibrating, and Thompson sits right at the intersection of both storylines. Whether nostalgia or strategy ultimately drives the decision, Golden State could find itself revisiting one of the most iconic partnerships in franchise history.","The Golden State Warriors have rotated through several shooting guards this season.

The wife of LA Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford has found her own way to rebound from Sunday’s exhausting Week 13 loss. Kelly Stafford skipped the gloomy weather and the sting of the Rams’ 31–28 defeat and headed straight to Mexico, where sunshine, warm water and good friends offered the perfect escape. She shared on Instagram that she has been in Cabo celebrating the 40th birthday of her close friend Jess Clausen, the wife of former NFL quarterback Jimmy Clausen. The trip has turned into a cheerful break filled with laughter, ocean views and a reminder that life moves forward.Kelly posted a carousel of photos showing the group relaxing on a boat, taking fishing trips, enjoying long beachside meals and even squeezing in a friendly tennis match. The podcaster looked confident and carefree in a bikini, soaking in the moment far from the rain-soaked stadium in Charlotte, where she had watched the Rams fall short after Matthew Stafford’s late fourth-quarter fumble. She had also been busy that night searching for the football from her husband’s record-breaking pass, which teammate Davante Adams had unknowingly given away.Matthew Stafford’s wife, Kelly, uploaded a series of sunny photos from the celebration in Los Cabos.She wore a green bikini as the centerpiece of her look, pairing it with soft layers and warm colors that highlighted the playful feel of the trip. The top carried a bright geometric print with emerald, lime and turquoise woven together. The matching bottoms had slim side ties resting high on her hips. She added a moss green wrap loosely knotted at her waist that showed off her toned midriff.Her accessories stayed simple. Kelly wore sleek black oval sunglasses, and in some photos, she added a silk bandana in warm oranges and pinks. The relaxed styling matched the tone of her caption, where she wrote, “Celebrating you is easy @jessclausen,” and added, “Happy birthday to one of my best friends, may this be the best decade yet ❤️❤️❤️.”Matthew Stafford, meanwhile, has already shifted gears. He said getting over losses “just feels like it comes easy to me” and reminded reporters that another game always waits. The Rams head next to State Farm Stadium for a division showdown with the Cardinals, and Kelly seems to be carrying that same forward-looking spirit.Also Read: Kylie Kelce reveals how Jason’s endless patience keeps their home calm amid four daughters’ nonstop “why” questions","Matthew Stafford's wife, Kelly, is enjoying a vacation in Mexico with friends.

Charlie Kirk Killing Firestorm: Owens Goes To War With TPUSA; Live Showdown Confirmed

TPUSA sets the livestream time, and Candace Owens gets upset

Candace Owens says the time clashes with her own show





Is Candace Owens backing out on TPUSA livestream?





Candace Owens and Turning Point USA (TPUSA) are fighting again, and this time it is over a meeting time that she says she never agreed to. On Thursday, Candace Owens said TPUSA set a livestream time about her remarks on Charlie Kirk ’s death without asking her first. She shared her anger on X and said she was surprised to learn about the plan only through a tweet.This whole issue started after Charlie Kirk was killed on September 10 at Utah Valley University. Since then, Candace Owens has shared many ideas and claims about what happened, even saying TPUSA leaders “betrayed” Charlie Kirk. She has not shared proof for these claims.Because her comments got a lot of attention, TPUSA’s Tyler Neff invited her to The Charlie Kirk Show to clear the air. At first, Candace Owens said yes. But when the date and time were posted without her input, things got heated again.Tyler Neff posted on X that the livestream would take place on Monday, December 15, at 4 pm Eastern.

Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa’s journey from power couple to breakup

Former tennis couple Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa were once seen as a bright, happy pair in the sport. But now, Tsitsipas’s mother, Julia Tsitsipas, has shared a very open view of why their romance did not last. She told Telegraf that the relationship was “complicated from beginning to end” and said both players entered it while already “traumatised” by injuries. Julia explained that their love was never simple. She said, “Their relationship was not ordinary, everyday,” and added that the breakup shook her son even though he never thought about ending his tennis career because of it.Julia also shared that the long-distance nature of the relationship made things even harder. She said Badosa did distract Tsitsipas at times, but the emotional pain after the breakup was stronger. As a former tennis player herself, she believed players should stay calm during such moments, but she still understood how difficult it was for him.Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa became one of tennis’s most loved pairs when they went public in 2023. Fans called them “Tsitsidosa,” and their photos and videos quickly spread online.But behind the attention, the two were dealing with their own struggles.When they started dating, Badosa was still recovering from injuries, and Tsitsipas was moving from event to event around the world. The distance made it tough. They first broke up in May 2023, saying it was friendly, but within three weeks they were back together. Their bond looked strong again, and fans were excited.However, by July 2024, things changed. Both players lost in the first round at Wimbledon, and soon after, they split again. A source told ¡Hola! magazine that the breakup “just happened” and said their injuries and rough period in tennis affected their emotions. The source also said there were no fights, no family issues, and no third person involved. It was simply two adults trying hard but unable to make it work.After their breakup, both unfollowed each other on social media and removed past posts. And in November 2024, Badosa quietly confirmed she was single by wearing a sash that read “Sexy and single” at her 28th birthday celebration in Dubai.Their story showed how even famous players face real feelings and real challenges, just like anyone else.Also Read: Andre Agassi shows rare soft side in Maryland as his sweet surprise for Steffi Graf turns into a cherished moment","Former tennis couple Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa broke up in 2024.

Michael Annett’s cause of death, racing career and achievements



Family and community mourn Michael Annett’s untimely demise



Former NASCAR driver Michael Annett has tragically passed away at the age of 39, his former team JR Motorsports confirmed on December 5. Annett, a respected figure in the motorsport community, raced for JR Motorsports from 2017 until his retirement in 2021.During his career, he earned a victory in the 2019 Xfinity Series season opener at Daytona International Speedway, marking a major highlight in his racing journey. Details regarding the cause of his death have not yet been released.The news has left fans and colleagues in shock, with tributes pouring in across social media. Annett’s career was defined by perseverance, skill, and a dedication to racing that inspired teammates and fans alike. Over the course of his professional journey, he established himself as a key contributor to every team he joined, leaving a lasting legacy in NASCAR.As of writing, the cause of death of Michael Annett is under wraps. Annett began his NASCAR career in 2008, driving in the Craftsman Truck Series for Bill Davis Racing. He made seven starts that season, achieving a best finish of second at Kentucky. He then progressed to the Nationwide Series (now Xfinity Series) with Germain Racing in 2009, finishing tenth in points during his rookie season.Over the next several years, Annett drove for multiple teams including Rusty Wallace Racing, Richard Petty Motorsports, Tommy Baldwin Racing, and HScott Motorsports.His return to the Xfinity Series in 2017 with JR Motorsports revitalized his career. That year, he scored seven top-10 finishes and achieved a career-best second-place finish at Road America. Annett also qualified for the playoffs, ultimately finishing ninth in the points standings. His first and only Xfinity Series victory came in 2019 at Daytona, where he started third and led 45 laps to secure the win.Following the announcement, JR Motorsports released a heartfelt statement: “Our thoughts and prayers are with the entire Annett family with the passing of our friend Michael Annett. Michael was a key member of JRM from 2017 until he retired in 2021 and was an important part in turning us into the four-car organization we remain today.” Fans, former teammates, and NASCAR enthusiasts expressed their grief online, praising Annett for his dedication and contributions to the sport.Annett’s career was ultimately cut short due to a stress fracture in his right femur in 2021, which forced him to miss several races and led to his retirement. Despite the early conclusion to his racing career, Michael Annett’s influence on NASCAR remains significant, and his memory will continue to be celebrated by fans and colleagues alike.Also Read: ""Complicated from beginning to end"": Paula Badosa and Stefanos Tsitsipas breakup mystery deepens as his mum points to injuries and emotional struggles","Former NASCAR driver Michael Annett has tragically passed away at the age of 39.

Blackhawks' Connor Bedard and Chloe Primerano relationship rumors explained



The hockey world erupted this week after Chicago Blackhawks sensation Connor Bedard was linked to Team Canada women’s defenseman Chloe Primerano. The speculation began when the two were photographed in the same setting at Hockey Canada’s Olympic preparation events, instantly giving rise to questions about whether there was more than a professional connection between them.As one of the NHL’s brightest young stars, Bedard has been under constant public scrutiny on and off the ice. Even casual sightings tend to go viral. And this interaction with Primerano was no exception. Social media quickly filled with theories, jokes, and fan hopefulness. Thus, turning a simple moment into a trending NHL storyline.Despite the excitement, no confirmed information supports the idea that Bedard and Primerano are dating. Sources close to Bedard have emphasized that he continues to keep his private life out of the spotlight. This aligns with his earlier dismissal of dating rumors. That is involving TikTok creator Emma Loken in 2023. The moment when he made it clear such speculation was baseless.On the other hand, Chloe Primerano, a rising figure in Canadian women’s hockey, has been preparing for future national team opportunities.Her presence at Hockey Canada’s camp appears tied to her development and Olympic evaluation; not any personal involvement with Bedard. She previously shined with the Minnesota Golden Gophers, posting 31 points in 35 games.The fan reactions ranged widely. Some supporters expressed excitement at the idea of two elite young athletes connecting, while others joked that Bedard should “focus on hockey” as he heads into the 2025–26 NHL season after a strong 67-point campaign. The situation also highlights how quickly parasocial narratives form around modern athletes, especially those in the spotlight as intensely as Bedard.For now, Connor Bedard remains officially single, and the Chloe Primerano rumors fall squarely into the category of fan-driven speculation. Unless either player chooses to address the story directly, the buzz remains just that; another chapter in the ongoing fascination with one of hockey’s most followed young stars.Also Read: NHL Update: Brad Marchand and his family hosts Thanksgiving to comfort teammates missing home","Chicago Blackhawks sensation Connor Bedard was linked to Team Canada women's defenseman Chloe Primerano.

Who Wins the Deal?

' front office is quietly positioning itself for a move that could reshape the late innings of the 2026 season. According to widespread reporting, including coverage from Sporting News and Seattle-based outlets, the Mariners are showing serious interest in Philadelphia Phillies left-hander Matt Strahm, one of the league’s steadiest high-leverage arms. As original writer Caleb Hightower noted, the Mariners are circling a move that would be received as a major statement around the league: “The Golden State Warriors have a chance to make a move that would stun the NBA world.” While referencing a different sport, the sentiment from Hightower reflects the magnitude insiders are attaching to a potential Strahm deal for Seattle.The Seattle Mariners, who finished 2025 with a top-10 bullpen ERA but limited left-handed depth, appear focused on Matt Strahm over other Phillies southpaws such as José Alvarado and Tanner Banks. With the Winter Meetings underway, league chatter suggests Seattle wants to solidify the final innings next to Gabe Speier, especially after falling one win shy of the 2025 World Series.No formal offer has been submitted, but analysts agree that the cleanest path involves a one-for-one swap: Matt Strahm goes to Seattle, while the Philadelphia Phillies receive top catching prospect Harry Ford.Strahm, owed $7.5 million in 2026, is entering his final year of club control.Ford, ranked No. 4 in Seattle’s system and No. 40 overall by MLB Pipeline, has long been considered one of the organization’s most dynamic young players. He hit .283 with 16 homers and an .868 OPS at Triple-A Tacoma before his late-season promotion in 2025. With Cal Raleigh entrenched as Seattle’s everyday catcher and coming off an AL MVP runner-up campaign, Ford’s long-term path is blocked.Philadelphia Phillies' interest makes sense. Ford’s 35 steals in 2024 minors showcase a rare speed-power profile for a catcher, and the Phillies are facing looming outfield needs, payroll adjustments, and succession planning behind J.T. Realmuto.Matt Strahm has quietly become one of MLB’s most reliable late-inning relievers. His .499 OPS allowed in high-leverage scenarios during 2025 underscores why Seattle Marinewrs view him as a playoff weapon. His ability to miss bats, paired with a 93rd-percentile chase rate, fits perfectly into a bullpen that ranked ninth overall but lacked left-handed strikeout juice.Seattle’s bullpen posted a collective 3.72 ERA in 2025, but with only Speier providing consistent left-handed production, the need for another late-inning southpaw grew increasingly obvious as October approached.• Immediate upgrade in high-leverage innings• A proven postseason arm with strong command• No long-term salary burden• Strahm’s profile matches T-Mobile Park’s pitcher-friendly environment• Helps address a bullpen that converted just 62.3 percent of save opportunitiesSeattle Marainers are also in an aggressive stage of its competitive cycle. Coming off a near-pennant run, the front office is attempting to maximize its window without sacrificing core pieces.• Harry Ford offers controllable years and fills both catching and outfield depth concerns• Phillies save $7.5 million for 2026, preserving flexibility for outfield or right-handed relief upgrades• Ford’s speed-power potential could address a lineup that needs athleticism and long-term planning• Allows Philadelphia to move a reliever before free agency rather than risk losing him for nothing• Strahm enhances the bullpen instantly with strikeouts and late-inning poise• Complements Seattle’s dominant starting rotation• Avoids long-term payroll commitments while keeping the roster competitive• Acquire an MLB-ready prospect with valuable versatility• Maintain roster balance amid impending outfield uncertainties• Add future cost-controlled production• Trading Ford thins catching depth behind Cal Raleigh• Strahm is 34, limiting multi-year upside• Reliever performance is naturally volatile• Losing Strahm removes their most reliable left-handed reliever• Ford’s defense still lags behind his bat and athletic toolsFrom a pure impact standpoint, the Seattle Mariners come out ahead in the short term. Their push to capitalize on a championship window makes Strahm’s role clear and immediate. His high-leverage steadiness, postseason readiness, and ability to neutralize AL West lefty-righty sluggers offer value that far outweighs the risk.Philadelphia, meanwhile, benefits from adding a high-end prospect without absorbing financial strain, but the loss of Strahm undeniably weakens their bullpen until internal arms or external signings fill the gap.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Chicago Cubs refocus on $80 million Boston Red Sox superstar to compensate for Kyle Tucker departure Both sides satisfy key organizational needs, but Seattle’s immediate return gives them the edge.","Matt Strahm has quietly become one of MLB’s most reliable late-inning relievers.

Connor McDavid talks Oilers’ offensive bounce-back against Kraken



POST-RAW | Connor McDavid 12.04.25

Edmonton Oilers’ star Connor McDavid expressed relief and optimism after the team displayed a potent offensive performance against the Seattle Kraken, scoring nine goals in a dominant display. After a challenging start to the season, this game offered a glimpse of the scoring rhythm that helped the Oilers reach back-to-back Western Conference finals. McDavid’s comments highlight both individual and team confidence returning at a crucial stage of the campaign.The Oilers improved to a 12-11-5 record with the victory, sitting just outside the Western Conference wild card playoff spots. For a team that has struggled to consistently replicate its playoff form, Thursday’s win provides a much-needed morale boost and underscores the offensive potential McDavid has consistently delivered throughout his career.During his media session, McDavid acknowledged the team’s offensive struggles this season but praised the collective performance against the Kraken. “Yeah, I feel like we haven’t really had that all year,” he said. “Feels good to get a couple as a group, and hopefully guys are feeling good about themselves and we can build on it.”Edmonton’s ability to score in bunches was on full display, with McDavid himself noting the uniqueness of the performance.He compared the moment to his first career hat trick in Dallas, emphasizing both the excitement and rarity of such an offensive surge. “You guys might think I’m crazy, but the only one I can remember like that would have been my first hattrick goal in Dallas. Definitely a unique one,” McDavid explained.Consistency will be key for the Oilers as they aim to climb the standings and secure a playoff berth. With McDavid leading the charge, Edmonton has the offensive firepower to challenge any Western Conference team. Analysts and fans alike will be watching closely to see if the Oilers can sustain this momentum and return to the form that made them one of the league’s top contenders in recent seasons.Thursday’s 9-goal performance not only boosts confidence but also sends a message to opponents that when the Oilers’ offense is clicking, they remain a formidable force. For Edmonton, the focus now shifts to maintaining this level of play as the season progresses, with McDavid at the center of their scoring efforts.Also Read: Connor Bedard extends goal streak as Blackhawks secure 2-1 win over Kings: Coach Jeff Blashill praises rookie’s “big step” forward","Edmonton Oilers' star Connor McDavid expressed relief and optimism after the team displayed a potent offensive performance against the Seattle Kraken.

With updated figures for 2025 now available, fans are comparing which teammate leads in earnings, salary structure, and overall net worth.While the two play very different roles in the Chiefs’ success, both have become global sports brands with rapidly growing financial portfolios.As of 2025, both Mahomes and Kelce hold an estimated net worth of around $90 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. The figures show how close their financial standings currently are, despite Mahomes signing a significantly larger playing contract.Kelce’s wealth comes from a blend of long-term endorsements, business ventures, and consistent All-Pro performances. Meanwhile, Mahomes’ meteoric rise, combined with major investment activity and one of the largest contracts in NFL history, has helped him build wealth rapidly.Mahomes currently holds one of the most lucrative deals in league history, a 10-year extension worth over $450 million, signed in 2020.His contract is structured with roster bonuses, proration adjustments, and incentives tied to MVP and championship performances. For the 2025 season, Mahomes’ base salary sits at $1,255,000, with over $21 million in prorated bonuses added to his cap figure.Kelce, on the other hand, signed a two-year, $34.25 million extension in 2024, which keeps him with the Chiefs through 2025. He earns an average annual salary of $17,125,500, including guarantees and roster bonuses. His 2025 season marks one of the most financially rewarding phases of his career.Mahomes and Kelce are also among the NFL’s most marketable athletes. Mahomes represents major brands including Adidas, State Farm, Subway, and Oakley. He also owns stakes in multiple sports franchises, including the Kansas City Royals and Sporting KC.Kelce’s endorsements include Nike, T-Mobile, Papa John’s, Walgreens, and Old Spice. He has also invested in brands such as Hydrow and Kodiak and has launched products including Hilo Gummies and his clothing brand, Tru Kolors.Mahomes leads in long-term potential earnings due to the size of his contract and expanding investment portfolio. Kelce, however, remains close in total net worth and continues to gain business opportunities and media visibility.For now, the financial battle remains nearly neck-and-neck - much like their chemistry on the field.","Kansas City Chiefs stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce continue to dominate the NFL headlines, both on the field and financially.

Also read:

As the Buffalo Sabres continue to carry with their three goalies on their active roster, which includes Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen, Alex Lyon, and Colten Ellis, the goaltending situation at the team might change as the team may be approaching a turning point. Reports suggest that Sabres general manager Kevyn Adams will have to make at least one goaltending move, and probably two, before the next season clears out the logjam.Meanwhile, rumors are doing the rounds that the Montreal Canadiens and the Edmonton Oilers have emerged as potential trading partners for Sabres goalie Luukkonen. While the situation remains uncertain, the interest appears serious, with both teams reportedly monitoring the situation closely. Let’s take a close look at the speculations that are currently hovering around the team.The Buffalo Sabres are still operating with three goaltenders, however, the setup may not last much longer, as the Buffalo Sabres are expected to move Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen.As per reports, the Montreal Canadiens and Edmonton Oilers have reportedly shown interest in Luukonen, and it has also come to light that the general manager, Kevyn Adams, is expected to make possibly two goalie-related moves before next season to resolve the growing roster congestion.Meanwhile, David Pagnotta of the Fourth Period stated, ""This may be something to look at around the draft... and this isn't the first time UPL's name has come up.

He has compiled a 2.51 goals against average and a .899 save percentage across eight games (seven starts) this season.According to the NHL , Luukkonen has signed a $23.75 million extension deal through 2028-29 after a 2023–24 campaign that saw a 2.57 goals-against average (GAA) and .910 save percentage that made him a promising rising star in the league.However, his recent form has been very inconsistent as the goaltender has posted a 2.51 GAA and .899 save percentage in the 2025–26 season so far, across eight games (seven starts).

Rumors are currently doing the rounds as the Nashville Predators’ center, Steven Stamkos, has once again emerged as a potential trade candidate amid growing speculation around his long-term fit with the team. For a long time, Stamkos hasn’t had a great relationship since he signed a four-year deal in the 2024 offseason.According to reports, several Eastern Conference contenders have quietly begun exploring the possibility of acquiring Stamkos. While no formal trade negotiations have been publicly confirmed yet. It has also come to light recently that, despite reports claiming the Predators haven't approached the 35-year-old right winger about his future, but his name continues to surface as a trade candidate.As per the NHL, Stamkos is signed through 2027-28 with an average annual value of $8 million and a full no-movement clause. The two-time Richard Trophy winner and Stanley Cup champion has seen a deterioration in his performance since tallying 40 goals in 2023-24 with his former club, the Tampa Bay Lightning.The Nashville Predators' disappointing season has put Steven Stamkos at the center of growing trade speculation. Reports suggest that several teams have approached the player to acquire him, and one of them is the New Jersey Devils.Meanwhile, Sportsnet’s Ryan Dixon suggested five potential destinations for Stamkos, provided he agrees to waive his no-movement clause. The teams he identified were the Montreal Canadiens, Winnipeg Jets, Seattle Kraken, Carolina Hurricanes, and Detroit Red Wings.Reports suggest that the Canadiens were reportedly looking into his availability in early November, but none of the others is believed to have made calls yet. However, NHL insiders and analysts are pointing towards New Jersey’s huge potential to acquire him.In fact, Pierre LeBrun, in his most recent article for The Athletic, stated, “My understanding is that the New Jersey Devils have discussed his name internally, among many other trade targets, of course.” He further added, “The Devils were also among the suitors for Stamkos when he was a free agent in 2024. So there’s a bit of history there. It’s something to keep an eye on as we get closer to the March 6 trade deadline.”But, it won’t be as easy as it seems to acquire him, as Stamkos has a full no-move clause on his contract, which makes it tricky for any team looking to acquire him.As for his current performance, Steven Stamkos has scored almost 53 points in 82 games last season, a 28-point drop-off from the previous year’s total. Despite recording six points in his last five games, he is currently on track for 33 points in 82 games this season.","Nashville Predators' Steven Stamkos at center of growing trade speculation.

Pokimane explains why she supports and chooses celibacy over a real relationship







Twitch star Imane “Pokimane” has gone viral once again after making a personal confession about her lifestyle choices. Recently, a short video of the streamer began circulating across X, TikTok, and Instagram. In the one-minute-14-second clip, Pokimane shared what she described as a “secret” with her fans, sparking widespread discussion online within hours.In the viral video, the 29-year-old streamer said she is “really into celibacy.” She explained that pacing herself when it comes to intimacy has many benefits. Her comments quickly drew strong reactions from both supporters and critics. The video also added to her recent string of viral moments, including her self-proposal on TikTok in November.In the clip, Pokimane openly explained her views on celibacy and intimacy.She told her viewers, “Can I tell you a secret? I’m really into celibacy. And that can range from not kissing on the first day to saving yourself for marriage. It’s a whole spectrum. And honestly, there are so many upsides to pacing yourself when it comes to intimacy. For starters, you can avoid becoming attached to the wrong person. We all know what that’s like.And that’s because both physical and emotional intimacy releases oxytocin, which makes you feel connected to someone, even though you may not be compatible. We often think that falling in love is a mystical, rare experience, but sometimes it’s really just hormones and chemicals.”She also said that staying celibate helps her focus on her personal goals. Pokimane added, “2 - I get to preserve my energy, and instead of constantly pouring it into someone else, I can focus on the things I want to accomplish first. A surefire way to avoid an emotional vampire is simply not to get so close that they can sink their teeth into you.”Later in the video, Pokimane spoke about the emotional safety she feels from her decision. She said being celibate leads to “less stress, less liability, and less risk of anything unwanted happening.” She further explained her views on modern culture by saying,“Last but certainly not least, less stress, less liability, and less risk of anything unwanted happening. There’s just about no downside to taking your time, but all the risk in rushing things. It’s truly up to you. And in a world that’s become only more hypersexual, it kind of feels like pacing oneself is the new counterculture. Whatever you choose to do, don’t forget to respect others’ choices and above all else, stay true to yourself. ”The viral moment follows another recent headline from Pokimane. On November 25, 2025, she surprised fans by buying a wedding ring for herself and proposing to herself in a TikTok video.Also Read: Plaqueboymax blasts disrespectful fans, defends woman he “cared about” during emotional livestream amid Keenyah Hill controversy","Twitch star Imane ""Pokimane"" has gone viral after making a personal confession about her lifestyle choices.

Dak Prescott sounds off after offensive pass interference call against Cowboys



Cowboys’ defensive lapses and controversial call prove too much to overcome



The Detroit Lions halted the Dallas Cowboys’ three-game winning run with a 44-30 victory on Thursday night, but the outcome quickly shifted from football to officiating. A fourth-quarter penalty on tight end Jake Ferguson became the focal point, sparking immediate backlash and putting the NFL’s officiating standards back under the microscope.For the Cowboys, the defeat wasn’t just about missed tackles or stalled drives, it was about a moment that flipped the momentum of a tight game. And Dak Prescott made it clear that he wasn’t buying the explanation behind the flag that derailed a crucial scoring opportunity.On a pivotal 3rd-and-3 from the Detroit 11-yard line, officials flagged Ferguson for offensive pass interference, wiping out a promising chance for Dallas to close the gap. The call stunned the Cowboys’ sideline and triggered immediate reaction across the league. While Pat McAfee took a playful jab at the officiating crew on his show, Prescott didn’t hold back when asked about the decision.“Do I get fined for talking about this? I’m sorry, that was bad,” Prescott said, choosing his words carefully before criticizing the ruling. “I got to look at the film, maybe I can see it from their vantage point.I talked to the ref after, he said [Ferguson] aggressively pulled through. I’ve never seen a call like that.”Prescott finished the night with 376 passing yards on 31-of-47 attempts, throwing one touchdown and two interceptions. His strong yardage output wasn’t enough to overcome Dallas’ defensive struggles, as the unit allowed 17 points on three consecutive Detroit drives in the second half. Those lapses, combined with the questionable penalty, created a deficit the Cowboys couldn’t erase.Detroit, meanwhile, executed with poise, capitalizing on Dallas’ mistakes and controlling key moments. Their balanced offense kept the Cowboys off rhythm, and the controversial call only widened the gap late.As debate over the penalty grows, the loss leaves Dallas with more questions than clarity. For Prescott, the frustration comes from seeing a crucial moment taken out of the Cowboys’ hands, and the impact of that call is sure to remain a major talking point in the days ahead.Also Read: NFL injury update: Baker Mayfield hopeful as Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan inch closer to Tampa Bay comeback",Dallas Cowboys lost 44-30 to the Detroit Lions on Thursday night.

Sal Licata reacts to Edwin Díaz, Devin Williams and why the Yankees’ stance feels odd

Edwin Díaz is one of baseball’s best closers and he is a free agent after opting out of his Mets contract at the end of the season. The New York Mets and other teams are talking about bringing him back, but reports say the New York Yankees are not seen as a serious threat to sign Díaz right now. That surprised many voices in baseball this week.Edwin Díaz closed big games for the Mets for years and he still throws hard and shuts down lineups. The Mets moved quickly this week by signing Devin Williams to a three-year deal, a move that could change Díaz’s market but teams, writers and radio hosts are asking why the Yankees would not at least try to chase him. The question came up on New York radio and on MLB coverage as free agency unfolded in early December 2025.Radio host and MLB commentator Sal Licata told listeners on WFAN that the Yankees should always be in the running for top players like Edwin Díaz.Licata asked why the Yankees “wouldn’t be a threat” to sign a top closer and made the simple point that big teams should pursue elite talent whenever they can.His comments aired after news broke that the Mets had agreed to terms with Devin Williams. The New York Mets signed reliever Devin Williams to a reported three-year, $51 million deal on December 2, 2025.That deal was reported by multiple outlets and confirmed by MLB sources. The move gives the Mets bullpen depth but does not remove Edwin Díaz from the team’s radar; MLB.com reported that the Mets remain interested in Diaz even after the Williams signing.Still, some insiders say Williams’ arrival lowers the Mets’ urgency to offer a long, costly extension to Díaz. Edwin Díaz is a three-time All-Star and one of the best closers available this winter.If the Yankees truly step away, it shifts the market and narrows Díaz’s choices. Licata and others see the Yankees’ reported posture as strange because New York has payroll room and a history of chasing top free agents.The radio reaction shows how quickly one signing Williams to the Mets can change roster plans across the league.Also Read: Bo Bichette Contract Talks Hit Another Pause After Analysts Explain Major Risks Facing The Toronto Blue Jays","New York Mets signed reliever Devin Williams to a reported three-year, $51 million deal on December 2, 2025.

Los Angeles Lakers’ bold Austin Reaves trade dream hits a harsh reality in Giannis Antetokounmpo chase

Giannis’ uncertain future takes a dramatic turn with injury amides trading issues

The NBA trade deadline of February 5 is quickly approaching, and conjecture surrounds Giannis Antetokounmpo's future. As the Milwaukee Bucks' star player, his status is a heated topic among both fans and analysts. According to recent projections, there are several prospective trading partners for him.As Giannis Antetokounmpo trade rumors heat up, the Los Angeles Lakers have emerged as a potential dark horse option to snag the Milwaukee Bucks superstar. In fact, multiple teams are emerging as strong competitors to sign Antetokounmpo. According to reports, the New York Knicks are the favorites, with a 28% probability of acquiring the two-time MVP via trade.The Los Angeles Lakers' decision to trade Austin Reaves for Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic, and LeBron James has generated significant attention. However, NBA expert Jake Fischer believes it may not be enough to close the deal.According to NBA insider Jake Fischer of The Stein Line, Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo told at least one teammate this summer that he believed a trade with the New York Knicks was virtually complete.Additionally, according to Shams Charania of ESPN, Antetokounmpo and his agent, Alex Saratsis, are ""having conversations with Milwaukee"" about ""whether his best fit is staying or [pursuing] a move elsewhere."" Naturally, the rumor mill has been in full swing ever since, with ""several teams"" allegedly considering trade packages for the two-time MVP.Furthermore, Fischer shed light on the growing Antetokounmpo trade environment, defining the Bucks' greatest odds for recouping value if they part with their long-time franchise cornerstone.While Fischer identified the Atlanta Hawks and San Antonio Spurs as potential trade partners, he was less optimistic about the Lakers' chances of pulling off a major deal. The league insider emphasized the organization's few trade assets outside Reaves, as well as the uncertainty of how Milwaukee will build around the fifth-year player.He wrote:“The Lakers simply don’t appear to have anything close to the draft capital — or the young talent — to truly make a competitive offer to tempt the Bucks … unless Milwaukee sees Austin Reaves as a [Trae] Young-esque talent who will emerge as a perennial All-Star to build around moving forward.”Nonetheless, Kalshi's market estimates indicate that Antetokounmpo will remain with the Bucks after the trade deadline by 29%. Despite trade rumours, Milwaukee is presently the top contender for his services.Antetokounmpo recently suffered a calf injury, prompting questions about his future with the organization. According to ESPN's Shams Charania, he is in talks with the Bucks about whether to stay or move on to another organization.The San Antonio Spurs also have a 15% probability of acquiring Antetokounmpo. Pairing him alongside rookie sensation Victor Wembanyama could result in a deadly tandem in the league.When healthy, Antetokounmpo has shown MVP-level skill this season, averaging 30.6 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 6.4 assists while shooting at an incredible 64%. However, he has already missed six games this season and is set to be out for another two to four weeks owing to a calf problem.Also read: Is Giannis Antetokounmpo playing tonight?

Kyler Murray’s foot injury forces Cardinals to evaluate QB future, contract, and trade options



The Arizona Cardinals’ 2025 season has taken a major blow, as star quarterback Kyler Murray will not play again this year. Murray, sidelined since Week 5 with a foot injury sustained against the Tennessee Titans, recently underwent additional testing and sought a second medical opinion. With recovery not progressing as expected, the former No. 1 overall pick’s season is officially over, leaving the Cardinals to reassess their quarterback situation.Head coach Jonathan Gannon provided clarity on Murray’s status during a Friday press conference. “Kyler underwent more tests this week and even went out of state for another opinion,” Gannon said. “Unfortunately, his foot isn’t improving enough for him to return, so he’ll be done for the year.” Gannon expressed disappointment but emphasized that the team’s focus remains on finishing the season strong while evaluating next steps for the franchise.Kyler Murray, the 2019 Heisman Trophy winner and NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, has delivered standout moments despite battling injuries. He earned Pro Bowl selections in 2020 and 2021 and led the Cardinals to a playoff appearance in 2021. However, consistency has been a challenge, and this latest injury raises questions about his long-term role in Arizona.From a financial perspective, Murray’s contract complicates the Cardinals’ decision-making. He is guaranteed $36.8 million for the 2026 season, with $19.5 million of his 2027 base salary guaranteed if he remains on the roster five days after the new NFL league year begins. Releasing him before June 1 would result in a $57.7 million dead cap hit, while a post-June 1 release lowers the 2026 impact to $50.5 million and adds $7.2 million in 2027.

Ryan Kesler’s new criminal case details and court ruling





Former NHL star Ryan Kesler, a two-time U.S. Olympian and longtime Vancouver Canucks standout, is once again in the spotlight. And, this time, due to a major legal development. The case against him, involving two misdemeanor counts of fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct, has officially been ordered to proceed to trial on Thursday.According to the criminal complaint, the alleged incident occurred on January 1 in Orchard Lake, Michigan. Kesler is accused of having sexual contact with a 16-year-old who was reportedly a friend of his daughter. The complaint further states that the actions involved force or coercion or that Kesler knew the victim was physically helpless.This new update follows a preliminary examination in which District Judge Marc Barron ruled that prosecutors had established sufficient probable cause. The charges stem from allegations filed on October 23, 2025, to which Kesler, now 41, pleaded not guilty. The decision marks a significant shift in the ongoing legal process. This is at the same time, intensifying public and league attention.The details outlined in the complaint have fueled widespread discussion, especially given Kesler’s high-profile status as a former Vancouver Canucks alternate captain and key figure of the mid-2000s and 2010s NHL landscape. His career included multiple 20-goal seasons. Along with a Selke Trophy win, and a memorable run to the 2011 Stanley Cup Final.The latest ruling ensures the case will now advance toward a full trial, where both sides will present arguments, testimony.Also Read: NHL Update: Brad Marchand and his family hosts Thanksgiving to comfort teammates missing home","Ryan Kesler's criminal case has officially been ordered to proceed to trial on Thursday.

Magic Johnson backs Austin Reaves after breakout night



Austin Reaves strengthens his All-Star case



The Los Angeles Lakers walked out of Toronto with a tense 123-120 win, yet the biggest story came from one of their most reliable young guards. Austin Reaves delivered the type of performance that shifts a season, lifting a short-handed Lakers squad while also drawing strong support from franchise icon Magic Johnson. The victory mattered, but the night also placed a fresh spotlight on Reaves’ rise as a central figure in the team’s push through the Western Conference standings.The Lakers entered the matchup missing Luka Doncic and saw LeBron James struggle with his shot, ending his long streak of double-digit scoring games. Reaves responded by taking control of the offense and attacking every possession with purpose. His calm playmaking, steady scoring bursts, and late-game poise helped the Lakers survive a Raptors team that had been nearly unbeatable at home.Magic Johnson made his stance clear after watching Reaves dominate the game. The Hall of Famer praised the guard’s leadership in a tough environment and highlighted the impact of his stat line. “Austin Reaves continued his dominant play this season scoring 44 points with 11 assists to lead the Lakers to a 123-120 victory over the Toronto Raptors!” he wrote on X. “Reaves should definitely be playing in the NBA All-Star game this year!”Reaves’ night was built on steady control of the offense, especially in the second half.He scored 30 of his 44 points after the break and attacked Toronto’s defense with a mix of drives, pull-up jumpers and confident threes. The Raptors entered the game with an 8-2 home record and leaned on Scottie Barnes and Brandon Ingram, yet Reaves carried the Lakers in every key stretch.Reaves’ performance adds to a season that already stands out across the league. He is averaging 28.9 points, 6.8 assists and 5.7 rebounds while ranking among the league’s top scorers and most efficient guards. His production without Luka Doncic has been even stronger, with averages of 41.0 points and 10.0 assists in four games.National voices are also taking note. ESPN’s Zach Kram placed Reaves in his “On the Bubble” tier but still projected him to make the final Western Conference group. “If I had to pick the 12 West All-Stars today,” he said, listing Reaves among his selections.Reaves’ role becomes even more valuable when the Lakers face nights like Thursday. James scored eight points and said he focused on “playing the game the right way” after finding Rui Hachimura for the decisive three. The win improved the Lakers to their 16th victory of the season, keeping them near the top of the West.Also Read: LeBron James sacrifices his 1,297-game double-digit streak to deliver the winning assist and lift Lakers past Raptors","Magic Johnson says Austin Reaves should be in the NBA All-Star game.

Blackhawks’ team effort shines against Kings’ continued offensive struggles



Connor Bedard’s remarkable rise continued under the bright lights of Los Angeles, as the rookie phenom found the back of the net for the third straight game in the Chicago Blackhawks’ 2-1 win over the Kings on Thursday night. With Chicago striving to build consistency on the road, Bedard once again delivered the momentum-shifting play that set the tone early.His presence has transformed the Blackhawks’ offensive rhythm, and each outing seems to strengthen his claim as one of the NHL’s fastest-emerging stars. The 20-year-old is not just scoring, but he’s driving the pace, dictating chances, and elevating those around him, turning every shift into a threat for opposing defenses.Bedard opened the scoring at 6:17 of the second period, crashing the crease and sweeping home Tyler Bertuzzi’s centering pass just nine seconds into a power play. The goal extended his red-hot stretch to four goals and six points across his last three games. Over his past 19 outings, Bedard now has 32 points, a level of production that underscores his growing command of the NHL stage.Blackhawks coach Jeff Blashill didn’t shy away from acknowledging the significance of Bedard’s climb, emphasizing that this surge is more than a promising stretch.“I think he’s obviously taken that big, big step this year to that next level,” Blashill said. “This isn’t a good start to me. It is kind of what he is. We see it on a nightly basis. He does it different ways, gets opportunities different ways, and sets up a lot of guys too. ”Wyatt Kaiser added Chicago’s second goal, while rookie forward Frank Nazar chipped in two assists in another strong supporting effort. Spencer Knight delivered a composed performance in net, making 26 saves, including crucial stops during a tense final stretch when the Kings pushed with a 6-on-4 advantage after Bedard was called for hooking.For Los Angeles, Trevor Moore scored the lone goal and Darcy Kuemper stood tall with 34 saves, but the offensive issues persisted. The Kings have now scored two or fewer goals in six of their past eight contests, a slump that forward Warren Foegele admitted has weighed on the group.The teams will meet again on Saturday in Los Angeles, giving the Kings a quick chance to respond and giving Bedard another opportunity to extend a streak that’s rapidly shaping his rookie campaign into something special.Also Read: Capitals’ Alex Ovechkin and Ryan Leonard makes NHL history with age-defying multi-goal performance",The Chicago Blackhawks beat the Los Angeles Kings 2-1 on Thursday night.

Joseph Woll’s injury's impact on Maple Leafs at Hurricanes game



The Toronto Maple Leafs faced another difficult night as goaltender Joseph Woll exited their NHL match today against the Carolina Hurricanes after two periods due to a lower-body injury. The timing could not be worse for the team, especially considering their struggles in the NHL standings and the ongoing pressure to regain stability in the Atlantic Division.Woll’s departure came without much warning, and head coach Craig Berube offered no detailed update postgame. By stating only that the team is still evaluating the extent of the injury. Fans are worried because of this lack of clarity. Especially given Woll’s importance in recent games. Also, in his role in keeping the Maple Leafs competitive. Despite defensive inconsistencies.Backup goaltender Dennis Hildeby was thrust into action for the third period, stepping in admirably to help secure a hard-fought performance against the Hurricanes. While Hildeby managed the situation well, the reality remains that the Maple Leafs are now without both Joseph Woll and Anthony Stolarz, who has already been sidelined due to injury.With two key netminders out, Toronto’s depth will be tested heavily as they attempt to stay afloat.This situation also raises questions about potential NHL trade rumors. As the Maple Leafs may be forced to explore emergency backup options or short-term moves. All depending on how long Woll and Stolarz remain unavailable.The injury concerns overshadow what was otherwise an important outing for the Maple Leafs, who continue searching for consistency. With their goaltending core depleted, every upcoming NHL match preview will revolve around who gets the nod in net and whether the team can remain competitive under the circumstances.For now, Toronto can only hope that Woll’s injury is not long-term; because without him and Stolarz, the road ahead becomes significantly more challenging.Also Read: NHL Update: Brad Marchand and his family hosts Thanksgiving to comfort teammates missing home","Goaltender Joseph Woll left the game after two periods due to a lower-body injury.

Pete Alonso and Kyle Schwarber seen as Boston’s strongest chance to upgrade the offense

Pete Alonso and Kyle Schwarber are now the two main power hitters the Boston Red Sox are looking at for this offseason. This comes after the Red Sox were knocked out by the New York Yankees in the postseason last month in New York. The team wants strong bats, and these two names are seen as the best way to fix the middle of the order, according to The Athletic reporter Jen McCaffrey, who wrote this in a detailed report published in late November 2025.Boston already added Sonny Gray and Johan Oviedo to help the pitching staff, but the club still needs a hitter who can bring steady power every day. The Red Sox lost Rafael Devers before last season in a trade, and Alex Bregman chose free agency this month. Because of that, the front office believes a strong hitter in the heart of the lineup is now the top need.Jen McCaffrey wrote that Pete Alonso and Kyle Schwarber “represent the best opportunity to upgrade the offense,” and the Red Sox front office agrees with that view.Alonso, who played first base for the New York Mets last season, is known for long home runs and steady run production.He becomes one of the top power bats on the market this winter.Published during the last week of November 2025, just before the start of the winter meetings, the report was made public.Having played for the Philadelphia Phillies in 2025, Kyle Schwarber hit 56 home runs last year. He is free to sign a long-term contract having earlier this month rejected the Phillies' qualifying offer in Philadelphia.Many MLB insiders predict he will sign a roughly five-year, $145 million deal.Having played in Boston in years past as well, Schwarber knows Fenway Park and how hitters adapt to the wall in left field.At the GM meetings this month, Red Sox chief baseball officer Craig Breslow told journalists and verified that the team is striving for a potent middle-order bat.Breslow said, “Someone who is a threat who can hit in the middle of the order and can lengthen our lineup is something we want to pursue.”His comments came during his on-record session with reporters, held at the annual meetings in Arizona earlier this month.These moves matter because Boston needs instant power. Both Alonso and Schwarber can change a game with one swing.If the Red Sox land even one of them, the lineup becomes much harder to pitch to, especially in tight games or late innings.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: Toronto Blue Jays Eying Kyle Tucker This Week As Pete Alonso Becomes A Key Red Sox Move","Pete Alonso and Kyle Schwarber seen as Boston’s strongest chance to upgrade the offense.

Khamzat Chimaev, Pavel Durov and what comes next for ‘Borz’

Khamzat Chimaev posted on X this week asking Telegram founder Pavel Durov to be in his corner for his next fight. The message came while Chimaev is off the fight list for a foot surgery and a planned recovery that will stretch into and after Ramadan 2026.Khamzat Chimaev said he wants a big name with him when he steps back into the Octagon. The post read in part, “Brother @durov in my corner next …” and the invite quickly made headlines across MMA sites and social feeds. Promoters and media now watch to see if Durov, the billionaire Telegram CEO will accept.Khamzat Chimaev is injured and will have a small operation on his foot, sources say. He told reporters he will pause full training until after Ramadan.That timing means he likely will not fight until late March or April 2026, depending on recovery. While he heals, Chimaev has named Nassourdine Imavov as a possible next challenger and has also answered calls for a superfight with Alex Pereira.Chimaev’s public invite to Pavel Durov adds a new twist. Durov is a tech billionaire (listed at about $17.1 billion by some outlets) and he has recently worked with former fighters like Khabib Nurmagomedov on Telegram projects.Khabib sold digital papakha collectibles on Telegram and helped raise roughly $4–4.5 million in November 2025, showing how the platform can link fighters and rich backers. That history makes Durov a logical target for Chimaev’s request.There is also history between Chimaev and Team Khabib. The two sides had a near-brawl after UFC 280 in Abu Dhabi in October 2022 when Chimaev pushed Abubakar Nurmagomedov.Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and Khabib later helped calm things down. Recently, Chimaev posted a message praising Islam Makhachev and showing he wants peace with the Dagestani group.That all makes a Durov cornering moment possible, since Khabib and Durov have worked together before.Chimaev’s X post and the reports appeared in late November to early December 2025.His surgery and plan to resume full training after Ramadan were reported during the same period by MMA outlets covering UFC offseason news.If recovery goes well, Khamzat Chimaev’s comeback fight could happen in spring or early summer 2026.Also Read: Joe Rogan Claims Jesus May Come Back As Artificial Intelligence And Sends Social Media Into Debate","Khamzat Chimaev is injured and will have a small operation on his foot.

Shilo Sanders’ NFL career and bankruptcy case raise questions about NIL earnings



Shilo Sanders, the NFL free agent and son of legendary coach Deion Sanders, is at the center of a growing financial and legal storm. The former Colorado safety, who recently filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, is now accused of making unauthorized transfers totaling $250,000. The controversy revolves around money earned from his college football name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals, raising questions about compliance with bankruptcy law.The dispute has attracted significant media attention, as Sanders’ attorney strongly challenges the claims. Keri Riley, representing Sanders, insists the allegations are fundamentally flawed and argues that the funds in question were legitimately earned after the bankruptcy filing. According to Riley, the earnings, processed through companies created by Sanders, Big 21 LLC and Headache Gang LLC, should not be considered part of the bankruptcy estate.The trustee handling Sanders’ bankruptcy case claims the NFL player improperly transferred funds post-petition, potentially violating federal bankruptcy rules. These transfers, linked to Sanders’ NIL income during and after college, are now under legal review.Riley maintains that the money was generated legitimately and was separate from any pre-bankruptcy liabilities, emphasizing that Sanders’ NIL agreements are a modern revenue source increasingly used by college athletes.Adding complexity, Sanders faces a longstanding financial obligation stemming from a 2015 lawsuit. A former high school security guard in Dallas alleged Sanders caused injuries during an incident, and a default judgment of nearly $12 million was awarded. While Sanders filed for bankruptcy to manage this liability, the current allegations over NIL transfers complicate his path to financial resolution.Despite off-field challenges, Sanders briefly joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an undrafted free agent. Reports indicate he signed a three-year contract worth roughly $2.97 million, although he earned just $1,572 in guaranteed money after being released during the preseason. His professional prospects now remain uncertain, with both legal and career questions looming.As this case unfolds, it highlights the intersection of bankruptcy law and modern NIL earnings, an emerging issue for athletes navigating financial and legal obligations. With Sanders’ attorney disputing the trustee’s claims, the outcome could set an important precedent for how post-bankruptcy NIL income is treated in the future.Also Read: “Never seen a call like that”: Dak Prescott slams referees after controversial penalty in Lions’ 44-30 win over Cowboys","NFL free agent Shilo Sanders faces $250K NIL transfer dispute amid bankruptcy case.
