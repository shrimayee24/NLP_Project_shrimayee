Saquon Barkley is the cover of Madden 26 — Should the Eagles star worry about falling prey to the Madden curse?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/saquon-barkley-is-the-cover-of-madden-26-should-the-eagles-star-worry-about-falling-prey-to-the-madden-curse/articleshow/121576414.cms,"Eagles superstar RB Saquon Barkley is officially on the cover of Madden 26! (Getty Images)

Will the Madden curse strike again with Saquon Barkley gracing the cover this year?







When Saquon Barkley pulled off his jaw-dropping reverse hurdle last season, it didn’t just electrify fans — it etched his name into football history. That kind of play doesn’t just dominate highlight reels; it earns the ultimate pop culture nod in the NFL universe: a Madden cover. And for the 2026 edition of EA Sports’ iconic video game, it's Barkley's moment in the spotlight.The Philadelphia Eagles' star running back has officially been announced as the cover athlete for Madden NFL 26, a recognition that puts him in elite company. Not only that, Barkley has been named to the prestigious Madden 99 Club — becoming the first Eagles offensive player to receive the honor. “Starring on the cover of Madden NFL 26 and being named to the Madden NFL '99 Club' are both dreams come true,” Barkley said. “I'm grateful to my teammates, coaches and Eagles fans for their support, and I can't wait to hit the field again to give Madden players more highlight-reel moments in Madden NFL 26.”After a season where he shattered records with 2,504 rushing yards — the highest single-season total in league history — Barkley’s spot on the cover seems more than justified. He also walked away with the AP Offensive Player of the Year award, further cementing his status as one of the league’s most dominant forces.But with this honor comes a shadowy question — is Barkley destined to be the next victim of the infamous “Madden Curse”?The so-called Madden Curse has been a part of NFL lore since the franchise began featuring players on its cover in 1999. The theory? That a featured athlete’s following season is marked by injury, underperformance, or sheer bad luck. Over the years, it’s claimed some of the biggest names in football — Marshall Faulk, Michael Vick, and even reigning stars like Odell Beckham Jr. and Christian McCaffrey.Of the 27 athletes who’ve graced the cover since 1999, 16 have ended up injured the following season. Others saw steep declines in performance. The curse may not come for everyone, but it has shown up often enough to spark superstition among fans and players alike.However, recent trends suggest the Madden Curse might be losing steam. Only 2.5 of the last 10 cover stars from 2014–2024 have suffered what could be called a “cursed” season. Even in cases like Josh Allen (Madden 24), while his interceptions spiked, he still produced a strong season overall. Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady, co-cover stars for Madden 22, delivered top-tier performances even if they fell short of Super Bowl glory. So while the curse has certainly touched careers, its grip seems to be loosening in the modern era.Saquon Barkley isn’t stepping into this spotlight blind. He’s coming off a historic campaign with the confidence of someone who already conquered the physical and mental hurdles that come with elite-level football. His addition to the 99 Club puts him in a rare tier — joining Eagles legends like Brian Dawkins (Madden 04) and David Akers (Madden 06) — and reaffirms that he’s not just making plays; he’s redefining the running back position.EA Sports VP Evan Dexter summed it up perfectly: “Saquon's reverse hurdle was one of the rare, defining moments in NFL history that would have once been described as 'something out of a video game.'” Now, it’s literally in one.The real question is whether the so-called curse will interrupt Barkley’s momentum. Given his physical condition, surrounding offensive talent in Philadelphia, and the calculated way he trains and manages his body, he might be one of the most prepared cover athletes to date.Let’s not forget — superstition doesn’t score touchdowns, and curses don’t chase down safeties. Preparation, grit, and a powerful offensive line do.Also Read: Chiefs’ 2025 comeback mission begins with Super Bowl heartbreak and Patrick Mahomes’ hunger for revenge","The Philadelphia Eagles' star running back has officially been announced as the cover athlete for Madden NFL 26.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is the heart of Oklahoma City’s title run

Tyrese Haliburton is Indiana’s engine and emotional leader

Pascal Siakam brings championship experience to the Pacers

Jalen Williams is Oklahoma City’s rising two-way star

Myles Turner is Indiana’s rim protector and defensive anchor





The 2025 NBA Finals are taking place and this time it’s a different experience. On June 5 at the Paycom Center, the Indiana Pacers will fight the top-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 1. The attention is at its peak since Oklahoma City has yet to win the championship since relocating and Indiana is looking for their very first win. Some players might take over from early in the series and here are five to look out for from the opening tip.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander leads his team into this first game as the league’s MVP and honestly, he fully deserves the title. In leading the Thunder, he helped the team to a stunning 68-14 season and averaged 32.7 points, 6.4 assists and 5.0 rebounds each game.In addition, in the postseason, he has consistently delivered with 29.8 points, 6.9 assists and 5.7 rebounds. Because of his ability to get a good shot, dribble around teammates and control the game, Young is a major concern to Indiana’s guards.The revival of the Indiana Pacers depends on Tyrese Haliburton. The All-Star guard has taken over, contributing 9.8 assists, 18.8 points and 5.7 rebounds each game so far in the postseason.In the Eastern Conference Finals, he improved his numbers, scoring 21.0 points and assisting on 10.5 every game against the Knicks. If Indiana is to win, it will rely on Kyrie Irving's great vision, quick decisions and ability to take shots.Pascal Siakam’s case shows why it matters. Chosen to help the young Indiana team in the playoffs, Siakam has played well when it matters most. Frequency of scoring inside, guarding different spots and spacing the floor means he can harm opponents in multiple ways. The presence of Siakam with experience from winning a title in Toronto could make all the difference in this young team.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is coming into Game 1 as the league's MVP, and honestly, he really earned it. He led the Thunder to an impressive 68–14 regular season, scoring an average of 32.7 points, 6.4 assists, and 5.0 rebounds each game. And it doesn’t stop there—he’s been just as effective in the postseason, averaging 29.8 points, 6.9 assists, and 5.7 rebounds across 16 playoff games. His talent for creating his own shot, cutting through defenses, and managing the pace makes him a serious threat against Indiana’s backcourt.Myles Turner’s ability to block shots is a major factor in why Indiana has been solid defensively during the playoffs. He changes the trajectory of shots, dominates the boards, and stretches the floor with his three-point shooting. Facing an OKC offense that’s quick and unyielding, Turner’s defense in the paint will be crucial for Indiana’s chances in Game 1.Also Read: NBA trade rumors point to a bold Toronto Raptors offseason with Giannis Antetokounmpo emerging as a potential target Game 1 of the 2025 NBA Finals is going to be explosive.

This angered Cardi B who later made a post that read as, “So dating because I’m single means I’m just worried about d–k?? You sound like a dummy.. trying to be fake nice after you did what you wanted from the beginning trying to push a narrative to these people. Congratulations!! F**k off.

Stephen A. Smith says teams like Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder prove depth beats superstar stacking in today’s NBA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/stephen-a-smith-says-teams-like-indiana-pacers-and-oklahoma-city-thunder-prove-depth-beats-superstar-stacking-in-todays-nba/articleshow/121580220.cms,"(Image source - Getty Images)

Stephen A. Smith Highlights the Rise of Depth-Driven Teams in the NBA Finals

THE PAUL GEORGE EFFECT 💥 Stephen A. on why teams SHOULDN’T stack stars in today’s NBA | First Take





The 2025 NBA Finals showcase a significant transformation in basketball strategy. The time when having three superstars ensured victory is behind us. Stephen A. Smith points out this change, referencing the Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder—teams that have chosen to emphasize depth and youth instead of star power—as models of a new, successful method for building championship teams. Their experiences challenge the old norms and indicate a rethinking of what it means to win in the current NBA.Stephen A. Smith has openly discussed how forming superteams isn't yielding the results people hoped for. He points out that even with star-studded groups like Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal, and Devin Booker in Phoenix, or LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook in Los Angeles, these teams haven't met the hype. On the flip side, the Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder have succeeded by building well-rounded teams with up-and-coming players and adaptable role players.The Thunder's rise is definitely impressive. Wrapping up the regular season with an outstanding 68–14 record, they were spearheaded by MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who put up an average of 32.7 points per game. With All-Star Jalen Williams by his side and key additions like Isaiah Hartenstein and Alex Caruso, Oklahoma City shows how teamwork can beat a bunch of solo stars.The Pacers' trek to their first NBA Finals in 25 years emphasizes the importance of depth and resilience. After dealing with some early-season hiccups, Indiana charged through the playoffs, beating strong opponents such as the Milwaukee Bucks and Cleveland Cavaliers. Their triumph is due to a solid roster featuring Tyrese Haliburton, Pascal Siakam, and Myles Turner, all playing key roles without any one player overshadowing the others.Both of these stories back up Smith's point that a well rounded, flexible team can be better than pouring everything into only the very best 2 people that you have. Adaptability, teamwork and having a good game plan is what is key towards making a championship worthy team in the current NBA scene exhibited by the Pacers and the Thunder.Also Read: Tom Thibodeau’s future with New York Knicks safe despite ECF loss to Indiana Pacers and fan criticism The NBA Finals of 2025 point to changes in how teams are created in professional basketball.

Elijah Moore praises Buffalo’s support and Josh Allen’s leadership amid Bills’ receiver overhaul,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/elijah-moore-praises-buffalos-support-and-josh-allens-leadership-amid-bills-receiver-overhaul/articleshow/121580178.cms,"Moore grateful for Buffalo’s warm welcome (Image via: Getty Images)

Elijah Moore ’s fresh start in a changing Buffalo receiving lineup







The Buffalo Bills are once again shaking up their wide receiver lineup, leaving fans wondering how Josh Allen will adapt without his top targets. Amid these changes, new arrival Elijah Moore is already praising the team’s passionate fanbase and supportive environment. With proven stars gone, Buffalo is putting its faith in fresh talent and a new chapter.For the second consecutive offseason, the Bills have made major moves in their wide receiver room. After trading Stefon Diggs and letting Gabe Davis walk in 2024, Buffalo watched Mack Hollins sign with the Patriots this year. Meanwhile, Amari Cooper’s future with the team remains uncertain. These departures have left a void for Josh Allen, who led the league with MVP-level play last season despite losing his top two weapons.Into this gap steps Elijah Moore, a reliable target in Cleveland with over 60 catches each of the past two seasons. Moore is optimistic about his new opportunity, sharing on social media, “Buffalo already has been nothing but great to me already. This place really takes care of they people.” His excitement reflects a player ready to embrace the challenge of stepping up in a high-powered offense undergoing transition.Moore also expressed admiration for Allen after observing him up close in practice. While Moore acknowledged the challenge of adjusting to a new team, he’s encouraged by Allen’s focus and precision. With Keon Coleman and Josh Palmer expected to start as boundary receivers, Moore could quickly emerge as a key weapon in Buffalo’s revamped offense.The Bills’ gamble on youth and new faces is bold, especially in a competitive AFC where reliable targets are crucial. But if Moore and the other newcomers can gel quickly with Allen, Buffalo’s offense may remain explosive despite the roster turnover.Also Read: ‘Gotta stay focused’: Stefon Diggs speaks out after controversial boat video surfaces As the season quickly approaches, all eyes will be on how these fresh pieces fit together and if Josh Allen can once again carry the Bills’ title hopes with a brand-new, untested receiving corps behind him.",Elijah Moore is the latest wide receiver to join the Buffalo Bills.

Olympic gold medalist Imane Khelif's medical report reveals she's 'biologically male',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/olympic-gold-medalist-imane-khelifs-medical-report-reveals-shes-biologically-male/articleshow/121566346.cms,"Imane Khelif ’s medical report contradicts IOC’s official position

Controversy around the Imane Khelif’s gold medal at Paris Olympic



IOC calls findings misinformation



Response of World Boxing Federation

Fairness and safety concerns from athletes and federations



Ongoing debate on gender and sport eligibility





A leaked medical report from the 2023 World Championships has revealed that Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelif is biologically male, according to chromosome analysis. The report, made public just days after World Boxing ordered Khelif to undergo sex testing for eligibility in future female competitions, shows she has a male XY karyotype. This revelation challenges the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) earlier dismissal of such tests and has intensified debate over fairness and safety in women’s boxing. The findings come amid ongoing controversy surrounding Khelif’s participation in women’s events, sparking calls for stricter verification procedures in sport.The report, published on the 3 Wire Sports website, states that Khelif’s chromosome analysis is “abnormal” and confirms a male karyotype. It was conducted by Dr Lal PathLabs in New Delhi, a lab accredited by the American College of Pathologists and certified by the International Organisation for Standardisation. This directly challenges the IOC’s spokesperson Mark Adams, who had described such test results as “ad hoc” and “not legitimate” during a press conference at the Paris Olympics.The controversy surrounding Imane Khelif’s Olympic gold medal run began as early as her first bout in Paris, where she faced Italy’s Angela Carini.Carini, an experienced and respected boxer, was visibly shaken during the match. Overwhelmed by Khelif’s strength and intensity, she appeared distressed and left the ring in tears after the fight, later telling media she had feared for her safety. The unease only deepened in the final bout, where Khelif defeated Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting in a dominant display that many felt was physically one-sided. The power difference between the fighters drew sharp criticism, with commentators and athletes calling it “uncomfortable to watch” and likening it to watching a man beat a woman in the ring. The moment became one of the most controversial of the Paris Games, fuelling an international debate over fairness and inclusion in women’s sport.IOC president Thomas Bach dismissed the report as part of a Russian-led misinformation campaign, citing ethical and financial issues within the International Boxing Association (IBA), which conducted the tests. Despite these claims, the legitimacy of the Indian lab’s certification has increased pressure on the IOC to clarify its position and respond to questions about Khelif’s eligibility.Following the leak, World Boxing has declared that Khelif must pass mandatory chromosome testing before competing in any future female events. The 26-year-old Olympic champion, who was allowed to compete in Paris due to her female passport status, has so far not provided evidence to confirm female chromosomes. World Boxing now requires all athletes over 18 in its competitions to undergo PCR genetic testing to verify their sex, a measure introduced in response to this controversy.The case has raised serious safety and fairness concerns within the boxing community. Opponents like Italy’s Angela Carini and Mexico’s Brianda Tamara have spoken out about the physical challenges they faced competing against Khelif. Latin American federations have been particularly vocal, urging that women’s competitions be restricted to athletes assigned female at birth, in order to protect fairness and athlete safety.The Khelif controversy highlights the complex and sensitive issues surrounding transgender and intersex athletes in competitive sport. It underscores the need for clear, consistent policies that balance inclusivity with fairness and safety. As governing bodies reassess their rules, the case remains a key example of the challenges faced in maintaining the integrity of women’s sports.The ongoing debate around Imane Khelif’s case brings to light just how complex and emotionally charged the conversation about gender and eligibility in sport has become. At the heart of it are real athletes — women who train for years and step into the ring expecting fairness. Many feel blindsided and unheard when competing against opponents whose physical attributes raise legitimate concerns about safety and equality. This isn’t about exclusion, but about protecting hard-won opportunities for women in sport. Khelif’s story reminds us that governing bodies must act transparently, thoughtfully, and with empathy for all athletes involved.","Leaked medical report from 2023 World Championships reveals Imane Khelif is biologically male, according to chromosome analysis.

Rickea Jackson claps back at pregnancy rumors with viral post

Los Angeles Sparks forward Rickea Jackson is breaking her silence after fans on social media began circulating baseless pregnancy rumors due to her absence from the team’s recent game. The 2024 No.4 WNBA draft pick, who was listed as “out for personal reasons,” wasn’t on the court during the Sparks’ 85-80 home loss to the Phoenix Mercury on Saturday. But while her team was dealing with an on-court loss, Jackson was addressing internet speculation most unexpectedly, with humor and a basketball.In response to rumors that she might be pregnant, Rickea Jackson took to X and posted a photo holding a basketball to her stomach, mockingly playing into the speculation. Her caption? “#ItsAGirl”That was followed up with another tweet to clear the air and warn fans not to trust social media accounts falsely claiming to have inside information. “1. My friends don’t use twitter. Yall gotta stop linking people because of a follow,” she wrote. “2. Yall come to conclusions everyday it’s hilarious, but I’m a ‘rich auntie’ typa gallll.”The direct response instantly caught fire online, with fans praising her for turning the rumor into a laughable moment instead of feeding the negativity. Many applauded her for protecting her peace while still staying playful.Jackson, who averaged 13.4 points in her rookie season, has had a quieter sophomore year so far, appearing in just three games and averaging 7.3 points on 31% shooting. With the Sparks reshuffling their roster this year, including the blockbuster acquisition of Kelsey Plum, Jackson’s role has slightly shifted, but her potential remains unquestioned.Following the loss to the Mercury, Sparks head coach Lynne Roberts addressed Jackson’s status, emphasizing support from the organization. “Rickea is a big part of our team,” Roberts said. “She is taking personal time, and we support her. We’re excited to get her back when she’s ready.”

For now, the rising WNBA talent is making it clear that she’s still in control of her own story, basketball in hand, rumors behind her, and a sense of humor firmly intact.Also Read: WNBA Issues verdict on investigation into racism claims during Angel Reese-Caitlin Clark game","Los Angeles Sparks forward Rickea Jackson has addressed pregnancy rumors.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli’s nearly 20-year-long quest for an Indian Premier League title with Royal Challengers Bengaluru reaches its most defining moment as RCB face Shreyas Iyer’s Punjab Kings in the IPL 2025 final at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Tuesday. But there’s a twist — rain could play spoilsport, with forecasts hinting at a brief drizzle in the evening.RCB cruised into the final with a commanding win over PBKS in the Qualifier 1. However, Punjab Kings bounced back with a gritty victory over five-time champions Mumbai Indians in Qualifier 2, setting up a high-stakes battle between two teams still chasing their first-ever IPL title since the league began in 2008.There’s an emotional layer to the contest as well. Kohli, who recently stepped away from Test cricket, is expected to take a break from all formats after the final. With no immediate ODI assignment on the horizon, this could be fans’ last glimpse of Kohli in action for some time.RCB have been a transformed unit this season — clinical, consistent, and composed. After years of heartbreak and missed chances, they’ve stormed into the final for the fourth time riding on big wins and rock-solid performances.A short delay won’t threaten the game, as up to 120 minutes of extra time is available to complete the match. However, if rain prevents play from being completed on Tuesday, the final will shift to the reserve day—Wednesday, June 4.If conditions don’t improve and no play is possible even on the reserve day, the team that finished higher in the league stage will be declared IPL 2025 champions.That gives Punjab Kings the edge.

Shohei Ohtani is one of the biggest names in the baseball community right now, and the Los Angeles Dodgers fans are excited to know if their star will play tonight against the New York Mets at Citi Field. The talented player has been amazing this season, but injuries have made people wonder if he'll be in the game. As the Dodgers take on the Mets in a big series, everyone wants to know if Ohtani will hit tonight.Ohtani looks set to play in the game tonight against the Mets, which begins at 10:10 p.m. ET. In September 2023, he had elbow surgery, and in November 2024, he had shoulder surgery, so he has only started hitting this season. He's doing great with a .310 average and 22 HR's, which is tied for most in MLB. He faced live hitters for the first time since his elbow surgery yesterday and threw 22 pitches in a practice session.While he won't pitch tonight, he's expected to be the designated hitter. Manager Dave Roberts said Ohtani's shoulder still has some stiffness, but it doesn't affect his hitting. The team is being careful with him. Fans are excited, hoping Ohtani will lead off and help the Dodgers win with his amazing hitting skills.Also Read: $765M man Juan Soto may be overthinking at the plate, Mets exec hints at mental strain Ohtani is a big part of the Dodgers' plan to beat the strong Mets team.

The Dodgers want him to be a two-way player again later this season, maybe after the All-Star break. His presence in the lineup makes the team stronger and excites everyone. Even Mets players watched his practice yesterday, showing how special he is.With other players like Mookie Betts dealing with a toe injury, Ohtani's hitting is super important. Manager Roberts will watch him closely to make sure he stays healthy while hitting well. Tonight's game could be a big moment for Ohtani to help the Dodgers win this important series at Citi Field with his incredible talent.Ohtani's possible return adds excitement to this Dodgers-Mets matchup.

George Russell hinted at Dan Ticktum while commenting on Spanish Grand Prix incident

Dan Ticktum responds to George Russell’s remark





Cupra Kiro driver Dan Ticktum has reacted to Formula 1 driver George Russell’s “one British driver in Formula E” mention when the latter was asked if he had ever seen a driver who did what F1 champion Max Verstappen did, that is, deliberately hitting another during a race. Ticktum responded to Russell’s remark by thanking him for “free publicity” and likening himself to none other than Verstappen, who is currently the reigning number 1 champion in Formula 1.Red Bull driver Max Verstappen was handed a 10-second penalty during the race and a three-point penalty on his licence for hitting George Russell’s Mercedes during the Spanish Grand Prix. One more mistake and he can face a one-race ban. When Russell was asked if he had seen any other driver do such a thing, he told the media, ""Not in Formula 1. Maybe in Formula E. Maybe one British driver in Formula E.”Dan Ticktum took note of Russell’s mention. Ticktum had received a two-year ban for deliberately hitting another driver during an MSA Formula (now British F4) race. He recently clinched his first podium of the season at the Tokyo E-Prix.Taking to Instagram to share a recorded response to Russell’s remark, Ticktum said, ""I have just had a very nice evening with the team and some of the guys from Porsche here in Shanghai.I’m just on the way back to the hotel. It has come to my attention via the Twittersphere that a certain driver in Formula 1 - not to name names but his name is George Russell - has made some rather choice comments about a certain Formula E driver. ”Thanking Russell for the mention, he further said, ""He hasn't named my name, but it's quite obviously pointed at me. We'd like to address those comments that he made I believe on the team radio. Number one, thank you for the free publicity. We'll take that any day of the week. And two, while what Max did today was a little bit sceptical, to be likened to him at any point in my career is a positive if you ask me. Goodbye.""Also Read: “Everyone doubts me”: Dan Ticktum after claiming first-ever podium at Tokyo E-Prix 2025 Round 9 Max Verstappen later penned a note in which he accepted that the mistake was not right and it “shouldn’t have happened.” Meanwhile, Dan Ticktum is now preparing for the Jakarta E-Prix.

IPL 2025 Final, RCB vs Punjab Kings: The wait will finally end in Ahmedabad

Poll Who do you think will win the 2025 IPL final on Tuesday in Ahmedabad? Royal Challengers Bengaluru Punjab Kings





: On December 15 last year at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru, chants of ‘RCB! RCB!’ during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20 finale seemed woefully out of place. Mumbai squared up against Madhya Pradesh, with MP’s skipper Rajat Patidar being the only RCB connection. Patidar’s unbeaten 40-ball 81 was overshadowed by Shreyas Iyer and his men’s fivewicket title triumph. A little over five months later, the duo is back as captains in the IPL’s final countdown.On Monday, the eve of the final, Patidar and Iyer sat on either side of the trophy, strung together by the commonality of their respective teams, RCB and Punjab Kings, chasing an elusive maiden title. The similarity between the duo probably ends there.Before the start of the previous domestic season, Patidar hadn’t led at the senior level, ever. Who would have imagined that Patidar, with a little help from his deputy Jitesh Sharma, would lead RCB, which has always been helmed by superstars of the sport, would find himself having a shot to history.In sharp contrast, Iyer, both as a captain and player, is a man of many accomplishments. He was skipper when Kolkata Knight Riders were crowned champions last season and led Delhi Capitals to the 2020 title contest.Patidar, the captaincy armband notwithstanding, is a subdued persona, but his Mumbaikar counterpart doesn’t shy away from pulling up his players on the field or showing who the boss is. Their contrast spills over to their confidence in public speaking as well. While Patidar is still learning the ropes, Iyer has mastered the art of fielding questions with assurance and aplomb.“No one can deny the expectations. For me, it’s important to be in the present. I always look at what is in my hands, what we can control. So, I always believe in controlling the controllables,” said the middle-order batter, who turned 32 on Sunday.Patidar is light on captaincy experience but is backed by a think-tank which has relied heavily on performance rather than star value. Will that be enough for RCB’s fourth shot at the title to finally bear fruit or will Iyer lift the trophy again, this time to end Punjab’s 17-year wait?","IPL 2025 Final, RCB vs Punjab Kings: The wait will finally end in Ahmedabad on Tuesday.

IPL 2025 Final, RCB vs Punjab Kings: The wait will finally end in Ahmedabad

Poll Will Virat Kohli finally lift the IPL trophy this year? Yes, it's his time to shine! No, Shreyas Iyer will claim it





: Some narratives run larger than the sport itself. For years, debate raged on whether Lionel Messi would be able to win a World Cup. Would the talented duo of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown lift the NBA trophy? Would Rory McIlroy be able to complete the career Grand Slam? As it turned out, they all had it in them to win the ultimate prize in their sport. Messi went on to win the World Cup in 2022, Tatum and Brown guided the Boston Celtics to a record-setting 18th NBA championship in 2024 while McIlroy won the Masters to earn a career Grand Slam this year.A similar narrative is taking shape here ahead of the IPL final between Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Punjab Kings (PBKS). RCB’s white-ball colossus Virat Kohli has a 50- over World Cup win, two Champions Trophy titles and one T20I World Cup triumph to his name. But the missing cup in the cabinet is the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) trophy. RCB have reached the final thrice before this but come up short on all three occasions. Will Kohli be fourth-time lucky or will a Shreyas Iyer-inspired PBKS walk away with their maiden title?Kohli and Phil Salt have been the ideal combination for RCB at the top, though the PBKS newball pair of Arshdeep Singh and Kyle Jamieson will pose a stern test. Mayank Agarwal has been steady at No. 3 and is followed by captain Rajat Patidar. The skipper has been aggressive from the word go.His ability to take on spinners will be key against leg spinner Yuzvendra Chahal. The trio of Liam Livingstone, wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma and allrounder Romario Shepherd provide the fireworks down the order. The overs delivered by PBKS medium pacers Vijaykumar Vyshak, Azmatullah Omarzai and Marcus Stoinis will prove to be decisive.Tim David’s injury is a question mark.Man to man, PBKS have a team to match RCB. Uncapped openers Priyansh Arya and Prabhsimran Singh have been fearless in their approach at the top while Australian Josh Inglis provides the impetus at No. 3. Iyer is the glue that binds the team. His calmness will be crucial to this team. Australia’s premier pacer Josh Hazlewood, along with pacers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Yash Dayal, will look to test the PBKS top order.Southpaw Nehal Wadhera in the middle order will be key to counter left-arm spinner Krunal Pandya and leg spinner Suyash Sharma. Lower-order batters Omarzai, Stoinis and Shashank Singh lend heft in the batting at the end overs.All in all, this looks like a contest in which the team that holds their nerve better will lift the trophy for the very first time.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) face Punjab Kings (PBKS) in the IPL 2025 final.

NEW DELHI: Cricket is often described as a game of fierce competition, but sometimes, moments of warmth off the field steal the spotlight. One such moment emerged after Punjab Kings defeated Mumbai Indians in Qualifier 2 of the IPL 2025 on Sunday at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.Despite Mumbai Indians’ spirited campaign — which saw them bounce back from four losses in their first five games with a stunning six-match winning streak — their journey ended with a five-wicket defeat to PBKS. Leading MI’s fight was none other than Suryakumar Yadav , who enjoyed a dream season, smashing 717 runs in 16 games at an average of 65.18 and a strike rate of 167.91, including five half-centuries.On the other side, Arshdeep Singh has been a pillar of Punjab’s bowling unit, claiming 18 wickets in 16 matches. While the two are fierce competitors in the IPL, they are teammates and friends beyond franchise lines.After the match, PBKS shared a heartwarming video that quickly went viral.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

IPL 2025 Winner Prediction: What Greenstone Lobo's Astrology says





: Outside the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, there are big cutouts of two captains Shreyas Iyer and Rajat Patidar. The handful of fans hoping to see Virat Kohli were perplexed to see the image of Rajat Patidar. ""Who is he?,"" asked one of the fans outside Gate No. 1. The vendor, who was busy selling jerseys, replied angrily, ""he is the captain of the team whose jersey you are buying.""The poor guy had no clue about Rajat Patidar, and murmured, ""wasn't Kohli the captain?""The vendors aren’t particularly fans of the sport but they have a lot of hopes riding on the proceedings and the outcomes.""There isn't a buzz this time around. We failed to sell Rohit Sharma's jersey ahead of Qualifier 2, and now we are struggling to find buyers for Kohli's. We don’t care who wins as long as we are selling jerseys. Hopefully, we will have more sales on Tuesday,"" said Krupal, before he started chanting the rates of the jerseys.Like Krupal, Mohammed Aslam sells wristbands, caps, and flags. Aslam jogs down memory lane and reminisced about the IPL 2023 final match between Gujarat Titans and Chennai Super Kings.""Despite the heavy rain, the fans from CSK, who had travelled from Chennai, were so passionate.We sold all our items, but this time around, there is no such hype,"" he laughed.Krupal and Aslam are not wrong about the mood ahead of the final. On Sunday, hardly 50,000 people turned up to watch the Qualifier 2 match between Punjab Kings and Mumbai Indians. There were no buyers for many of the hospitality boxes as they were empty.The IPL final, which was shifted to the world's biggest stadium in Ahmedabad, has failed to create any buzz in the city. Hyderabad and Kolkata were supposed to host the playoffs as per the original dates but the venues were changed citing ""weather conditions."" The rain, however, has continued to follow the business end of the cash-rich league as there was a heavy shower ahead of Qualifier 2 and a light spell is expected on Tuesday as well.Even if the weather permits and the match goes ahead, it would be interesting to see whether the title clash will be able to fill the Narendra Modi Stadium.In the pre-match press conference, both captains chose to keep cards close to their chests. Shreyas Iyer spoke about lack of sleep while a soft-spoken and very un-RCB-like captain Rajat Patidar reserved praise for the fans and vowed not to get bogged down by the unreal expectation.The PBKS players, tired from their rain-affected marathon match, didn't turn up for the training session. Captain Shreyas left the venue after the photo shoot but RCB did train for around two hours.Once RCB left the ground, the pitch and the inner ring were immediately covered, and final touches were applied to the makeshift stage for the closing ceremony. India's leading musician Shankar Mahadevan, accompanied by his sons Siddharth and Shivam, will deliver a special performance in a tribute to India's armed forces.“See you at the FINAL tomorrow ❤️ What an honour this is!!!” Shivam Mahadevan shared his excitement on Instagram.Buzz or no buzz, one thing is for sure: there will be a new IPL champion. Between Bengaluru and Punjab, the wait of one franchise will end.","The IPL final has failed to create any buzz in the city.
