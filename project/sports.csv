Burning rage or selective storm?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/burning-rage-or-selective-storm/articleshow/119014561.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

A year ago, I was invited to speak at a prison. Before the programme, I noticed a frail young man fixing a laptop. He looked like any other techie in a corporate office—small-built with inquisitive eyes, neatly dressed.

“I thought he worked here,” I said to the jailer, and swallowed my shock as the jailor called him over. The young man introduced himself as an engineer who was once a team leader at a tech firm. Work was demanding, but life was good—until that fateful night. “My wife and my mother never got along. One night, I returned home—exhausted, stressed and hungry. My mother was visiting the next day, and I had agreed to pick her up from the station without consulting my wife. My wife was furious. I tried to explain, but she wouldn’t be pacified. Something snapped inside me,” he said.

“Blood rushed to my head. I leaped at her like an animal, slapped her hard, and banged her head against the wall. She collapsed. Her eyes, frozen in disbelief, haunt me even now. A momentary rage shattered my life. My child is in her grandparents’ custody; I may never see her again. I don’t know what took over me in that moment. It wasn’t me.” He turned back to his work, a man forever burdened by the question—who was that stranger within him?

Life throws an endless supply of provocations at us-the impatient honking behind us at a red light; the maid taking off on an important day; an overlooked promotion. But for some, anger is not a flicker—it’s an inferno.

Though anger is listed as one of the deadliest of sins, for generations, some men wore their tempers like a badge of masculinity. A Tamil adage says, “The hand that strikes is the hand that embraces”. These are all extensions of the myths about anger – that it helps one succeed and inspires respect; that the supreme hand of the caregiver can hit the vulnerable under their care. But the reality is different. A short-tempered person may be tolerated but never loved.

They are a menace—to themselves and to those who endure their wrath. Anger is not just an emotion; it is a storm that ravages the body. Cortisol levels surge, the pulse races, blood pressure spikes, pupils dilate and sweat pours. Once, this response helped our ancestors fend off wild animals. Today, it fuels tragedies—a husband striking his wife over a trivial quarrel, a father lashing out at a child, a moment of fury obliterating a lifetime of love.

Science corroborates what wisdom has long warned: those who explode are 25% more likely to develop coronary artery diseases. Still, they take pride in ruling their tiny worlds with the assumed authority their anger gives them. It is equally interesting that even the most hot-headed individuals control their tempers before their superiors. Instead, the vulnerable become dumping grounds for bottled-up rage—children, spouses, aging parents.

Thiruvalluvar devoted an entire chapter to anger. He posed a question to those who claim to have tamed their fury:

‘Chellidaththu Kaappaan Sinam Kaappaan: Allidaththu

Kakkin En? Kaavakaal En? ‘

If you claim you are managing your anger, restrain it to those who cannot resist you.

If you boast of suppressing it with the powerful, how does it matter?

Before we pride ourselves on self-control, let us ask: does our restraint extend to those who depend on us, or do we unleash our wrath on them because we can? For anger, like fire, first consumes the hand that holds it.

Wayne Gretzky and Gary Bettman to follow Alex Ovechkin’s historic chase

Hockey history waits to be rewritten, and the all-time leading goal scorer, Wayne Gretzky , will be there to see it. The Great One will be on hand for games as Alex Ovechkin approaches breaking his historic mark of 894 career goals.With only eight goals to reach and 16 games left in the Washington Capitals' regular season, the excitement is building to a fever pitch. The NHL is going all out to celebrate this historic milestone, including a special in-arena ceremony when Ovechkin finally scores goal number 895.NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman will also be tracking Ovechkin’s journey across North America. Though details on when Gretzky and Bettman will begin attending games remain unclear, their presence underscores the significance of this record-breaking moment.""Alex Ovechkin's pursuit of the NHL's all-time goal-scoring record is a major milestone not just for hockey, but across the entire sports world,"" said Jon Weinstein, the NHL’s chief communications officer. ""We're looking forward to marking this historic chase in multiple ways that reflect the magnitude of this incredible moment.""Unlike Gretzky, who established his goal-scoring marks early in his career with jaw-dropping seasons of 92, 87, 73, and 71 goals, Ovechkin has sustained his dominance over more years. The 39-year-old has reached an incredible nine 50-goal seasons and has reached at least 40 goals 13 times. Even after breaking his left leg earlier this season, he only missed 16 games, showing the resilience that has characterized his career.The pursuit of 895 occurs in the midst of unusual circumstances. Ovechkin has played under a lockout-compressed season, two COVID-interrupted seasons, and the Russia-Ukraine war, adding another layer to his legacy. Others would suggest that if it weren't for those interruptions, he would already be over Gretzky.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky: The Great One reflects on his legacy, Hockey culture, and life lessons amid ongoing backlash With the NHL and hockey world in attendance, Ovechkin's quest to break Gretzky's goal record is more than a player milestone—it's a tribute to two eras of hockey greatness.

Jason Kelce reveals the toughest NFL player he ever faced during his 13-year NFL career,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jason-kelce-reveals-the-toughest-nfl-player-he-ever-faced-during-his-13-year-nfl-career/articleshow/119017584.cms,"Credit: Getty Images

Jason Kelce Reveals His Most Challenging Opponent – And It’s Not Who You’d Expect



After battling some of the NFL's most dominant defensive linemen for 13 seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles , Jason Kelce recently opened up about the most difficult opponent he ever faced—and the answer has surprised many. Despite facing elite players like Aaron Donald and Dexter Lawrence, Kelce named journeyman defensive tackle Poona Ford as the player who consistently gave him the most trouble throughout his career.During his 13-year career, Jason Kelce went head-to-head with some of the best defensive linemen of his era. Naturally, Aaron Donald—a future Hall of Famer—was the obvious choice when Kelce was asked about the best player he ever faced. While appearing on the Pardon My Take podcast, Kelce admitted, ""The best player I ever played against was Aaron Donald, for sure."" However, Kelce explained that Donald often lined up against guards rather than centers, which meant that direct matchups between them were rare.Kelce also acknowledged the challenges posed by other elite players, including Dexter Lawrence and Damon ""Snacks"" Harrison. Lawrence, in particular, emerged as a major challenge in the latter part of Kelce's career due to his size and strength. Harrison, known for his dominance in the interior line, also made a lasting impression on Kelce.However, when pressed to name the player who gave him the most consistent trouble, Kelce’s response was unexpected: Poona Ford.Kelce’s explanation of why Ford gave him so much trouble highlights the nuances of NFL trench battles. Ford, despite being just 5-foot-11 and 310 pounds, possessed a rare combination of shorter height and longer arms that made him uniquely difficult to handle. Kelce admitted, ""I was always for some reason like not the best guy (against) Poona Ford... He had longer arms and he's shorter than me. At least with the bigger guys I can get under him and get leverage on him, and if I play a shorter guy, at least I have longer arms. So when you play someone shorter with longer arms, I've negated every technical advantage I have.""This physical mismatch stripped Kelce of the leverage and arm-length advantage that he typically relied on against other defenders. ""I have no mass advantage... I hated playing Poona,"" Kelce added, highlighting just how frustrating these encounters were for him.What makes Kelce's revelation even more surprising is Ford's relatively low profile in the NFL. Unlike Donald or Lawrence, Ford hasn’t earned Pro Bowl nods or major accolades. However, his stats reflect his quiet effectiveness. Over seven seasons, Ford has accumulated 11.5 sacks, 229 tackles, 37 tackles for loss, and 39 quarterback hits—solid numbers for a player who has quietly made a significant impact despite not being a household name.Ford’s journeyman career has seen him play for three teams, and he is set to join his fourth for the 2025 season. While most fans might overlook him, Kelce's respect for Ford’s unique skill set speaks volumes about his effectiveness.Also Read: Did Travis Kelce record his podcast at Taylor Swift’s NYC home? Swiftie spot key detail Kelce’s career saw him take on the best in the league, but it was Ford's rare combination of size and reach that gave the veteran center the most trouble. For someone with Kelce’s resume to single out a lesser-known player like Ford as his most difficult matchup underscores just how much of an impact Ford quietly made on the field.","Jason Kelce recently opened up about the most difficult opponent he ever faced.

Anna Marie Kupp reacts to Cooper Kupp’s release



The Los Angeles Rams have officially parted ways with Super Bowl LVI MVP Cooper Kupp after eight seasons, marking the end of an era for one of the franchise’s most decorated players. Kupp’s departure on Wednesday came after the team failed to find a suitable trade for the veteran wide receiver, despite his instrumental role in the Rams' recent success. The news was met with an emotional response from his wife, Anna Kupp, who took to social media to express her unwavering support.Although the announcement didn’t come as a surprise—given that Kupp had previously revealed the team’s intentions to trade him—it still marks a significant shift for the Rams and their fan base. The 30-year-old receiver, who was drafted in the third round of the 2017 NFL Draft, quickly established himself as one of the league's most consistent and dynamic playmakers. His standout 2021 season, in which he secured the NFL’s Triple Crown (leading the league in receptions, receiving yards, and touchdowns), culminated in a Super Bowl MVP performance that cemented his legacy.However, injuries and the natural effects of aging have slowed Kupp’s production over the past three seasons. He’s set to turn 32 in June, and despite his declining numbers, Kupp remains confident that he can still contribute at an elite level. His release reflects the Rams’ broader effort to reshape their roster and manage salary cap constraints, but Kupp’s departure leaves a noticeable gap in the team’s offensive lineup.Following the announcement, Anna Kupp shared an emotional and inspiring message on Instagram, underscoring her confidence in her husband’s future. She posted a picture of Cooper in his Rams uniform, paired with heartfelt words about his leadership and impact both on and off the field:“Wherever we go, wherever we land, is going to be so f*ing lucky to have you in their building. You have the ability to turn the tides of any organization you step foot into.”Anna continued, highlighting Kupp’s unwavering dedication and influence on those around him:“The man that you are, the leader that you embody, the brother on and off the field. The standard you hold yourself to and bring others along in your pursuits. People want to be better because of who you are and how you conduct your business.”Her tribute concluded with an expression of faith in Kupp’s ability to thrive in the next phase of his career:“The joy and passion you exude in your preparation and execution is contagious. I am so excited for the impact you will have in these coming years, the relationships waiting for you, and for you to continue to tear apart your opponents. To the moon, my King.”Kupp also addressed the situation himself, posting a confident message on X (formerly Twitter):“Next chapter starts now. Best is yet to come.”Anna has been a constant presence in Kupp’s life since they began dating in 2012 while attending different high schools in Washington state. The couple, who are set to celebrate a decade of marriage this summer, have weathered the ups and downs of Kupp’s career together. From his rise to becoming a Super Bowl champion to now facing the uncertainty of free agency, Anna’s unwavering support remains a driving force for Kupp.Also Read: ""What is $5 million more going to do"": Bills’ Josh Allen jokes about giving the team a $5 million “discount” on his new contract As Kupp prepares to join a new team, the football world will be watching closely to see if he can reclaim his spot among the NFL's elite.

Is Rodgers headed for a coaching role in San Francisco?



Aaron Rodgers Caught Deeply Contemplating His Future On Beach | Pat McAfee Show

Why the 49ers and Why now?



Aaron Rodgers’ future in the NFL remains one of the biggest talking points in football. While teams like the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Giants are rumored to be in the mix, a surprising alternative has emerged—coaching. Reports suggest Rodgers may step away from playing in 2025 and join the San Francisco 49ers ’ staff, potentially setting the stage for a major leadership role in the future.Rodgers has repeatedly dismissed the idea of coaching post-retirement, but circumstances change. As one of the most intelligent quarterbacks in NFL history, he possesses the strategic mind that could make him a successful coach. With insiders predicting that he may not suit up in 2025, some believe he could step into a coaching role with the 49ers, possibly positioning himself as Kyle Shanahan ’s eventual replacement.""While Kyle Shanahan is safe for the 2025 NFL season, there is a real chance that his future in 2026 is not,"" Marissa Myers noted. ""With that in mind, it presents the perfect opportunity for Rodgers to take the next step in his career, and enter the realm of coaching."" (via: Sporting News)Also Read: Steelers set to sign veteran QB in 2025 Free Agency, but it’s not who you think Shanahan has guided San Francisco to multiple deep playoff runs, but his tenure has also been marked by inconsistency. With four playoff misses in eight seasons, concerns about his long-term viability continue to grow. Critics argue that his inability to adapt is holding the 49ers back. Rodgers, a four-time MVP, could bring a fresh perspective and serve as a mentor for young quarterback Brock Purdy, helping the team transition into its next phase.Adding to the intrigue, Rodgers’ California roots make this move even more compelling. A lifelong 49ers fan, he once dreamed of being drafted by them. If he transitions into coaching, leading his hometown team would be a full-circle moment in his storied career.Rodgers remains unpredictable, keeping fans and analysts on edge. But if he decides to swap his helmet for a headset, the 49ers could be his next big move, one that shakes up the NFL landscape and redefines his legacy.","Aaron Rodgers may step away from playing in 2025 and join the San Francisco 49ers ’ staff.

Jimmy Butler and Steve Kerr Exchange Heated Words After Controversial Late-Game Shot in Warriors' Win Over Portland Trail Blazers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/jimmy-butler-and-steve-kerr-exchange-heated-words-after-controversial-late-game-shot-in-warriors-win-over-portland-trail-blazers/articleshow/118941015.cms,"Image Via Getty

Steve Kerr Explains Why He Told Jimmy Butler to Break NBA’s Unwritten Rule

Jimmy Butler’s Triple-Double Overshadowed by Controversial Shot

Jimmy Butler single handedly forces a shot clock violation

Gary Payton II Scores Career-High 26 Points to Lead Golden State Warriors to Victory

What should have been a straightforward win for the Warriors turned into a mess after the game. Jimmy Butler 's triple-double was overshadowed by a last-second shot that really upset the Portland Trail Blazers players — and it looked like it got under Butler's skin too. A video from after the game showed a tense moment between him and coach Steve Kerr , who later revealed he was the one who told Butler to take that shot. Here’s the whole story behind that unexpected twist.As the clock wound down in the Warriors' 130-120 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, Jimmy Butler was in a bit of a bind. With Golden State comfortably ahead and only a few ticks left, he had to choose between holding the ball or taking a shot. Usually, teams would just let the clock run out in these moments. But after a quick glance at Steve Kerr on the sideline, Butler decided to take an open jumper, which ruffled a few feathers among the Trail Blazers players.Footage from after the game showed Jimmy Butler frustrated during a brief but intense talk with Steve Kerr. Kerr later explained his reasoning, saying, “I told him, we don't do shot clock violations. If there’s a shot clock differential, we always shoot.” Kerr’s firm stance on this philosophy put Butler in a tricky situation, even though he seemed a little reluctant on the court.Butler had a standout performance that evening! He scored 15 points, pulled down 10 rebounds, and tallied 10 assists, marking his second triple-double this season and his first as a Warrior. His previous triple-double was on December 16 while he was with the Miami Heat. The Warriors are sitting pretty with a 12-1 record when Butler plays, highlighting his significant role in their success.While all this is happening, Stephen Curry keeps shining this season, hitting five 3-pointers and bringing his total to 251. This is his 11th season with 250+ threes, which is an NBA record. He’s just two 3-pointers away from being the first player to hit 4,000 career triples.Even with the fuss going on, the Warriors' depth was a key factor in their victory. Gary Payton II had an impressive night, scoring a career-high 26 points and tying his record with four 3-pointers. Buddy Hield also made his mark with six 3-pointers and 20 points, showing off the Warriors' strong offensive lineup.The arguments between Jimmy Butler and Steve Kerr after the game definitely caught some attention, but it doesn't take away from how well the Warriors played. With Stephen Curry on the verge of hitting a major milestone and Butler stepping up with his all-around skills, Golden State is proving they're a force to be reckoned with.Also Read - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander vs Nikola Jokic: Who Truly Deserves the 2025 NBA MVP?

NEW DELHI: Yuzvendra Chahal is set to return to Northamptonshire for the 2025 County Championship season after impressing during his stint with the club in 2024. The India leg-spinner’s new deal will see him join the squad from June—once his IPL 2025 commitments with the Punjab Kings are complete—and stay on until the end of the English season.Chahal will feature in both the County Championship and the One-Day Cup, with his first match expected to be on June 22 against Middlesex. In 2024, he made an immediate impact, taking five wickets on debut against Kent in the One-Day Cup and later delivering a sensational 9-99 against Derbyshire in the County Championship—a career-best performance.His contributions proved vital as Northamptonshire secured back-to-back wins against Derbyshire and Leicestershire, with Chahal finishing the season with 19 wickets at an average of 21 across just four first-class games.“I thoroughly enjoyed my time here last season, so I’m very happy to be coming back. There are some great people in that dressing room, and I can’t wait to be part of that again. We played some great cricket towards the back end of the season, so hopefully, we’re able to replicate that and big up some victories,” said Chahal.Despite not featuring for India since 2023, Chahal was part of the squad that won the 2024 Men’s T20 World Cup. His international experience, coupled with his county success, makes him a prized asset for Northamptonshire.New head coach Darren Lehmann shared his enthusiasm about Chahal’s return: “I’m really excited that one of the best leg spinners in the world is returning to Northamptonshire this season. He brings invaluable experience, and he’s an absolute gentleman who loves the game.

Colin Cowherd says Aaron Rodgers reminds him of Donald Trump — here’s why



NFL free agency is in full swing, with teams across the league reshaping their rosters, particularly at the quarterback position. Major moves have already been made — Sam Darnold has joined the Seattle Seahawks, Justin Fields has landed with the New York Jets , and Geno Smith has been traded to the Las Vegas Raiders. However, one notable name remains without a new home: Aaron Rodgers . Following his departure from the New York Jets, Rodgers is now a free agent, leaving fans and analysts speculating about his next move.Aaron Rodgers' uncertain future has stirred up intense discussion among sports commentators. On Wednesday's episode of ""The Herd,"" Fox Sports 1 analyst Colin Cowherd made headlines by comparing the four-time NFL MVP to former President Donald Trump — a comparison bound to create waves.“I think Aaron is a little like Trump, they give off the same energy that they receive,” Cowherd remarked to co-host Jason McIntyre. “I’ve known people who I wouldn’t think would get along with Trump, who have gotten along with Trump. If you give Trump a certain energy, you can get along. I think Aaron gives you the energy that you give him, and that’s his personality.”Cowherd’s comparison stems from Rodgers’ perceived polarizing nature, which has mirrored Trump’s divisive public persona. Both figures have cultivated loyal followings while simultaneously alienating others. Rodgers' outspoken stance on controversial issues, including his friendship with anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has added to this perception. Interestingly, RFK Jr. had reportedly considered Rodgers as his running mate for the 2024 presidential election — a proposal Rodgers turned down to remain focused on football.Rodgers’ time with the Jets unraveled during the 2024 season after he failed to return to peak form following his Achilles injury in 2023. The Jets' struggles on the field, combined with Rodgers’ perceived lack of accountability, seemingly convinced the organization that it was time for a fresh start. The team has since appointed a new general manager, a new head coach, and a new starting quarterback, signaling a clear desire to move forward without Rodgers.At 41 years old, Rodgers’ playing window is closing fast. His personality and history of turbulent exits — first from Green Bay and now from New York — have made potential suitors cautious. While Rodgers’ talent is undeniable, his strong personality and the potential for off-field drama could deter teams from taking a chance on him.Also Read: Texas judge grants protective order to woman who accused Chiefs’ WR Xavier Worthy of assault A decision on Rodgers’ future will likely need to be made soon, both by the quarterback himself and any interested teams.

MUMBAI: It won’t come as a surprise if Saturday’s WPL finalists—Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals—opt to chase if the toss rolls in their favour.Both teams have enjoyed success while hunting down targets this edition.MI have opted to bat second on five occasions and have won four games. DC decided to chase on six occasions and succeeded in five of them, twice against their rivals on Saturday.With both teams batting deep, they feel more comfortable chasing. Many matches going down to the wire this season is a testimony to that as well.MI may look top-heavy with Hayley Matthews, Nat-Sciver Brunt, and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur batting at No. 2, 3, and 4. The small but effective contributions of Amanjot Kaur and Sajeevan Sajana give them that confidence. It’s similar to DC as well. While Meg Lanning , Shafali Verma, Jemimah Rodrigues, and Jess Jonassen have done the heavy lifting for them, they have the likes of Niki Prasad, Sarah Bryce, and Shikha Pandey, among others, to provide that back-up in case the top order has an off day.MI have an edge when it comes to their bowling, especially in the spin department, with off-spinner Matthews and leg-spinner Amelia Kerr among the top two wicket-takers in the tournament.On the eve of the final, while both captains didn’t reveal their cards, they agreed that backing their skills and strengths is what matters. MI’s Harmanpreet said that their decision depends on the “conditions” and they “plan accordingly for it,” but the focus is on doing things they are “comfortable about.” “We never thought too much about winning the toss. It’s just going out there and performing,” she added.Her DC counterpart Lanning assessed: “It’s about what your strengths are and backing that. And throughout the tournament, we’ve done that.” She added: “We’re not too bothered about what we do first. The conditions seem to be similar throughout the match. It’s just about doing whatever we can in that first innings and then backing yourself.”In the last two finals, DC won the toss both times, but their batters failed to put on a fighting total on the board. In the 2023 final, MI restricted them to 131 before registering a seven wicket win. Last edition, Royal Challengers Bengaluru shot them out for 113 before recording an eight-wicket victory.Lanning is aware of it, and she admitted that there’s more on the line in the final than a round game. “We’ve just been focusing on what we can do this year and playing to our strengths, backing ourselves. What’s happened in the round games, doesn’t count for anything. It’s about performing tomorrow night,” said Lanning.MI will be playing their fourth match in six days, while Capitals have had a seven-day break. Both captains had a different take on their schedule. While Harmanpreet felt that it “will play to their advantage” as they “now know the conditions well”, Lanning felt that the break gave them time to “refresh” themselves and the conditions won’t be alien as a lot of their players have played here.","Both teams have enjoyed success while hunting down targets this edition.

The Street Profits vs DIY

The first WWE SmackDown as part of their European tour was a remarkable night of excitement, huge moments and a surprising title change.WWE SmackDown was presented from the Olimpic Arena in Barcelona, Spain. This was the company’s first show as part of their European tour and was a night of explosive in-ring matches, some of the loudest fans in the world and top notch main event showdown which saw WWE titles changing hands.The match was made by SmackDown GM Nick Aldis following an altercation that involved all six men in the opening segment. Both sides competed in an explosive back and forth contest that had the fans in Spain on their feet. In the end, Braun Strowman delivered a huge splash and Powerslam on Tama Tonga to pick up the win for his team. However, the action did not stop there as both sides continued to brawl even after that.This was Charlotte Flair’s first match back on SmackDown for the first time since she got injured in 2023. The young upstart, B-Fab, put up a great effort against Flair, but it was not enough to put her down. Flair made her tap out to the Figure 8 and refused to let her go. This led to Tiffany Stratton coming to her aid and a brawl breaking out between them. Even when the Miz TV segment started, they came back outside to continue the brawl. It finally came to an end after Tiffany dived from the top of the entrance screen onto Flair and the security officials.The Miz dismissed fans singing along Cody Rhodes’ theme song with him. This led to Rhodes knocking him down with a punch. He then turned his attention to his WrestleMania 41 opponent, John Cena and told him that should he decides to grace him and the fans with his presence, he will be waiting in Brussels on RAW for him.A backstage altercation made the match official. Damian Priest and Shinsuke Nakamura put up an excellent match for the Spanish audience. A huge back-and-forth action saw Drew McIntyre appear ringside just as Priest was about to put away Nakamura. He avoided the distraction and countered Nakamura. But McIntyre interfered, causing disqualification, followed by a beatdown on Damian Priest by both McIntyre and Nakamura.The Spanish crowd loudly sang Randy Orton’s theme song as he came out and was in full support of The Viper. Carmelo Hayes displayed an excellent showing against the future WWE Hall of Famer. But a thunderous RKO outta nowhere sealed the win for Orton. However, Kevin Owens intervened after the match as Orton was about to inflict more damage on Hayes, and Owens himself narrowly escaped his wrath.Gunther insulted the Spanish audience and then brought his opponent for the night, Spain’s own and current one-half of the NXT tag team champions, Axiom. The masked superstar put up a great effort against Gunther, and both men delivered a captivating showdown for the loud Spanish fans. However, Axiom fell to the wrath of The Ring General as he delivered two Powerslams to seal the win and added insult to injury by locking in the sleeper hold on Axiom after his victory.Paul Heyman came out for an in-ring segment. He announced that it was Roman Reigns's day, marking the release of WWE 2K25, whose cover star is The OTC. He dismissed all CM Punk chants and announced that Reigns would be on SmackDown in Bolonga, Italy, next week.The main event of the SmackDown in Barcelona saw The Street Profits challenging DIY for their WWE Tag Team Championships. The action was jam-packed and garnered loud reactions from the Spanish audience. It was an excellent display of classic tag team wrestling. Towards the final moments of the bout, Angelo Dawkins hit a Sky High on Johnny Gargano with Tomasso Ciampa being taken out already. Montez Ford followed it up with a huge Seven Star Frog Splash to cover him for the three count. With their win, The Street Profits were crowned the new WWE Tag Team Champions.Also read: WWE 2K25 The Island Guide: How to start, Missions, Multiplayer Gameplay and More","WWE SmackDown was presented from the Olimpic Arena in Barcelona, Spain.

A day after dethroning reigning champion Jonatan Christie , Lakshya Sen faltered against Li Shi Feng of China 10-21, 16-21 in the men’s singles quarterfinals of the All England Championships in Birmingham on Friday.Soon after, the Indian challenge ended as the women’s doubles pair of Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand lost to Chinese second seeds Liu Sheng Shu and Tan Ning 14-21, 10-21.Given his 7-4 win-loss record and having won the last two matches against Li last year, Lakshya was expected to fare well in the quarterfinals. But the Indian was a pale shadow of the shuttler on show against Christie.From 4-4, Li widened the gap. He scored eight points on the trot and Lakshya was out of the first game even before he had warmed up.Emboldened by the easy victory in the first game, Li started on an aggressive note while Lakshya crawled his way back. With good netplay and by pushing the shuttle to the corners with good effect, Lakshya secured a crucial three-point lead (11-8) at the halfway stage. However, Li toned down his aggression and scored the next four points by engaging the Indian in long rallies, mostly close to the net. It was anybody’s game till 15-15.Thereafter, Li came up with two smash winners and a lucky net drop to widen the gap to 19-15. Li produced 10 smash winners in the second game to silence Lakshya.The 87-minute three-game second round contest against Koreans Kim Hye Jeong and Kong Hee Yong, late on Thursday affected TreesaGayatri, who had only 14 hours to recover for the quarterfinal.Though they led 10-7 at one stage the duo struggled to move well on the court. The Chinese took off from 7-10 and won 14 of the next 18 points to pocket the first game. In the second game they were even more dominant. “We were slow on the court today.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Champions Return: Rohit, Hardik, Shreyas, Gambhir return after India's title triumph

NEW DELHI: Retired Test opener David Warner has cast doubt on whether England’s high-octane "" Bazball "" approach will hold up on Australian soil, insisting it’s a risky tactic against the conditions Down Under.“I don’t know if 'Bazball' is a myth now, but I can’t see it happening in Australia,” the 38-year-old told reporters this week, as quoted by Fox Sports.Warner, who called time on his international career last year, had a front-row seat to England’s aggressive style during the 2023 Ashes . While the approach earned praise for its entertainment value, he believes the fast-paced batting might falter on bouncier Australian pitches .“With the bounce and everything, the fields Australia set last time in England, it would be pretty high risk to play that in Australia,” he said.“It’s probably not the way to go about it. If that is the way they go … it’s going to be high tempo, high energy and we’ll all get a couple of days off at the back end.”England’s ""Bazball"" era, led by Test captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum , has seen mixed results since kicking off three years ago. The team surged to a dominant home summer in 2022, then made headlines with a record-breaking 3-0 whitewash in Pakistan.However, their fortunes turned in 2023. England failed to retain the Ashes on home soil and later slumped to a 4-1 series loss in India, reigniting doubts about the long-term sustainability of the ""Bazball"" strategy in varied conditions.Meanwhile, Warner is gearing up for a new challenge. Earlier this week, he was picked up by the London Spirit for AU$245,000 in The Hundred Draft . He’ll reunite with former Australian coach Justin Langer as the 100-ball tournament kicks off in August.Warner’s home ground will be Lord’s—where tensions famously boiled over during the 2023 Ashes, as he and his teammates clashed with MCC members in the Long Room. Asked about the reception he expects from Spirit fans, Warner was candid.“We’ll just have to wait until I step foot on that park first, won’t we? Then we’ll see how the reception is,” he said.“I’ll have to walk past the Long Room first to get to the changing room! I actually want them to come at Australians. I love that stuff, that’s what gets me going but I want them to support London Spirit.ALSO SEE: Why all 50 Pakistan cricketers went unpicked in The Hundred Draft “If they want to boo me, boo me, but don’t boo the team.

Excerpts:

How should Bumrah be managed, given he has had his share of injuries?

How invaluable is Bumrah to India’s scheme of things?

Was Bumrah’s performance in Australia the best by a visiting bowler?

What do you make of India’s Champions Trophy triumph?

Did India have an unfair edge in the CT?

How do you look at India’s white-ball dominance? Can it be extended?

How can India become a bigger force in the longest format?

CHENNAI: Legendary Australia fast bowler Glenn McGrath has backed Jasprit Bumrah to make a strong comeback from his back injury, saying that the premier India pacer has to be “smart” about it as he is no longer young. Bumrah missed the Champions Trophy with a lower-back issue and is likely to be unavailable for the first few weeks of the IPL season . McGrath, the director of the MRF Pace Foundation here, also praised India for making the best use of the conditions during their CT triumph and asserted that they did not have an unfair advantage although they played all their matches at one venue.He puts more stress on his body than the other bowlers. He has found ways to manage it, but unfortunately not all the time. He has done it before (making a comeback from injury), he will know better than anyone (about) the recovery time, the time in the gym. He is not as young as he used to be, so he has to be smarter about what he does.He has to work even harder off the field. Being a fast bowler is like driving a car. If you do not top it up with fuel, you are going to run out of fuel sooner or later. My fuel tank was bigger than Jasprit’s because I did not bowl as quickly as him. These guys know how they work at their best. If India are under the pump, they need him.He is an experienced fast bowler and is one of the best in the world. He is unique. I take keen interest in Jasprit and the way he goes. The recent Australia-India Test series showed how important he is to India. If you take Bumrah out of that series, it could have been very one-sided. If he had been fit enough to bowl in the second innings of the last Test (Sydney), you never know. To play five Tests in a row is a massive ask and you have to look after him.The stats say that. Without a doubt, he was unplayable sometimes. It looked like he would get a wicket every over. I would not have minded playing on those pitches.They were the team to beat and they played well. Virat Kohli came back to form, as did the other guys. Australia had their chances in the semifinal, obviously we had a few of our bowlers who were out. The pitches took spin and India played well.It is the way it is. India does not travel to Pakistan anymore. There was only one other thing — the matches had to be played in Dubai. You have to give credit to India, they played to the conditions. They know how to play on spinning tracks. I do not think that they had an unfair advantage. It is like saying there is an unfair advantage if India play all their matches in India, if Australia play all their matches in Australia.Their IPL and T20 cricket has had a positive impact on one-day cricket. India are confident and they know their game well. It is important to protect Test cricket, but ODIs and World Cups are very important as well. India know the ODI game very well. It is a challenge for other teams to come over to India and play well. I like them to be challenged, but India are a quality team.They have quality players, there is no doubt about it. Test cricket needs India to be strong. They have got the batting lineup and the bowlers. They just need to make sure that their second-tier bowlers, who bowl around Bumrah, have the quality.",Glenn McGrath backs Jasprit Bumrah to make a strong comeback from back injury.

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

Dinesh Karthik (C) spoke at the RCB Innovation Labs, Indian Sports Summit in Bengaluru.

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

COUNTRY VS FRANCHISE TALENT IDENTIFICATION

Had India not won the Champions Trophy in Dubai, it is quite conceivable that Rohit Sharma ’s place at the helm of the Indian cricket team would have come under scrutiny. He was on a perilously slippery slope, having fared poorly with the bat in back-to-back series losses against New Zealand and Australia in red-ball cricket. Forget captaincy, his place in the side was questioned. And in Dubai, he faced criticism over his fitness.But success in the white-ball version has shone the spotlight on his leadership acumen. Former Indian wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik , who was part of the Indian team when they won the Champions Trophy in 2013, watched Rohit and his men’s successful journey from the commentary box recently. He believes Sharma’s leadership skills are second to none.Speaking at RCB Innovation Labs, Indian Sports Summit here on Friday, Karthik said: “In the past nine months, this Indian team has won two massive competitions (T20 World Cup and Champions Trophy). So, I think the sky's the limit for them because they are led by a very able leader in Rohit Sharma. You can see that he’s got the respect of his peers. Most importantly, he walks the walk and talks the talk with how cricket needs to be played.”Still, even with the best leadership, one needs a smattering of talent to go the distance in a multi-team event and the fact wasn’t lost on Karthik. “The beauty of this Indian team is the strength and depth that they have in terms of the number of players that they've got,” he said. “Not many countries today can say that they can field two or three teams in international cricket and have them competing with each other.”Did the IPL have a role in India’s near dominance of white-ball cricket? “India right now is in a very privileged and blessed place where they have such a good assortment of cricketers across skill sets. They could easily compete for the next decade or so considering the assembly line of players that the IPL and Indian domestic cricket are producing. The value in terms of understanding pressure, the big moments is what makes this Indian team really special,” said Karthik, who was in conversation with former England player and commentator Isha Guha and Mo Bobat , Royal Challengers Bengaluru ’s Director of Cricket.The 39-year-old gloveman went on to say: “In a lot of sporting environments, superpowers don’t go on to win tournaments. It’s always a challenge sometimes to just manage and assemble a group of players that produces results.”Once known as the T20 ‘razzmatazz’, Karthik believes the IPL, which turns 18 this year, has ensured a paradigm shift in perception and practice.“For a long time, Team India has been a cricketing nation which used to be happy competing, but now that attitude has changed. We want to win, and fans expect the team to win. That is what IPL has done. The influx of money has meant financial benefits that teams and stakeholders earn and a lot of it has gone back into infrastructure. When infrastructure grows, eventually the quality of sport develops and that’s the two biggest takeaways I think post the introduction of IPL in 2008,” said the current RCB batting coach and mentor.Karthik, who made his IPL debut for the erstwhile Delhi Daredevils, reflected on playing alongside Australian pace Glenn McGrath and the takeaways from it “For me the whole ideology of how Australia played at that time was a massive shock. They felt like a pack of wolves out to win every game. But with IPL, in my first year I got to spend time with Glenn McGrath in close quarters and practice with him. I got to know him better and became comfortable, that helped the confidence and mindset of competing with the best,” he said at the Padukone Dravid Centre of Excellence.Highlighting the difference between talent identification for a national team and a franchise, Bobat, who quit his role as performance director of the England men’s team to join RCB in 2023, stated, “In international cricket we often found that you were trying to really unpick and make sense to identify talent that was playing at a level beneath international cricket and making predictions about whether that talent could thrive at the level above. Coming over to RCB, firstly, it's an international market because you have overseas players. Understanding Indian talent is quite hard because of the volume and unstructured nature of it as well. So, finding talent in India is a much bigger challenge than it is finding it in the UK, but in a good way.”","Dinesh Karthik is the batting coach of the Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian football superstar Neymar has been ruled out of the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Colombia and Argentina due to fitness concerns.The Brazilian Football Confederation announced this decision through a video statement by coach Dorival Júnior, who cited unspecified reasons for the exclusion of Neymar, goalkeeper Ederson, and defender Danilo from the squad.The 33-year-old striker, who recently rejoined his former club Santos in January, last played on March 2 but was substituted due to an apparent left thigh injury. As a precautionary measure, he was rested for the Sao Paulo state championship semifinal against Corinthians a few days later.Neymar's absence has paved the way for Real Madrid's promising young striker, Endrick, to be called up to the national team squad. Ederson's replacement is Lyon's Lucas Perri, while Flamengo defender Danilo has been replaced by his club teammate and Brazil veteran, Alex Sandro.Neymar's return to the national team setup this month marked a significant milestone, as he had been absent for almost 1 1/2 years due to an ACL injury sustained in October 2023 while playing for Brazil against Uruguay. His recent recovery and return to action had raised hopes for his participation in the upcoming qualifiers.Brazil, currently fifth in the South American qualifying standings, faces a crucial double-header, hosting Colombia on March 20 before traveling to Buenos Aires to take on the group leaders, Argentina, five days later.The absence of key players like Neymar, Ederson, and Danilo undoubtedly presents a challenge for the Brazilian team. However, it also provides an opportunity for emerging talents like Endrick and others to step up and showcase their abilities on the international stage.","Neymar has been ruled out of the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Colombia and Argentina due to fitness concerns.

MUMBAI: ""Form goes up and down,” says Nat Sciver-Brunt , so she wants to make the most of it as the “feeling when you are not so confident isn’t that nice.”It’s a captain’s delight to have someone like the England allrounder on the roster. The 32-year-old has unlocked her beast mode for Mumbai Indians this season, topping the Orange Cap list with 493 runs in nine games at an average of 70.42, with the help of five fifties. She already became the first player to score 400-plus runs in WPL history and is just seven runs short of crossing the 500-run mark in a season. She also has nine scalps in her kitty, putting her in the driver’s seat to take the Player of the Tournament award.She also played a stellar role in MI’s title run in the inaugural edition in 2023, scoring 332 runs and taking 10 wickets.A trait of top players is that they always find a way to improve their game consistently, and Sciver-Brunt is among those. During this campaign, she has impressed with her ability to score at a brisk rate through the middle overs. Her career strike rate in T20Is is 118.12, while in WPL it is 143.24, but in this edition, her strike rate stands at 156.50.Other MI batters have benefited from it, as well as her calm approach while batting, which has given the likes of Hayley Matthews and Harmanpreet Kaur the time to build their innings.Sciver-Brunt stressed that she didn’t try anything different in the lead-up to the tournament. “I haven’t done anything different in terms of my preparation or how I go about my innings. I have stuck to my strengths quite a lot and have played what is in front of me,” she said.Besides scoring briskly, what has made her more dangerous is her ability to score all around the park. Fuller lengths have been dispatched down the ground or through the covers, while anything slightly wide or short has been sent to the boundary with ferocity.Sciver-Brunt and Matthews have developed a nice understanding between them, which has seen them stitch match winning partnerships for MI. Like the 71-ball 133-run association against Gujarat Giants in the eliminator on Thursday, which was also their second 100-plus stand of the season. They also put on a 133-run association against UP Warriorz (UPW), besides two 50-plus stands—92 and 57 against UPW and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), respectively. She has also taken on the lead role while mentoring the West Indian, who at times has found it difficult to construct her innings.“Apart from this tournament, I haven’t really batted with Hayley, but we seemed to click well from the first year. (Against Giants) she wanted to go off after a quicker start, but it was good she stayed out there and didn’t give her wicket away. I was just reassuring her that you only need to time the ball, you don’t need to whack it,” reasoned Sciver-Brunt.","Nat Sciver-Brunt has scored 493 runs in nine games for Mumbai Indians.

Champions Return: Rohit, Hardik, Shreyas, Gambhir return after India's title triumph

NEW DELHI: Pakistan cricket has once again found itself in the middle of controversy and chaos following its first-round exit from the Champions Trophy 2025 — a tournament they were hosting on home soil after 29 years.The disappointment has not only triggered fan outrage but also exposed deep divisions among past and present coaching figures. Mickey Arthur , who led Pakistan during one of their more successful white-ball phases, was brutally honest in his criticism. Speaking to talkSport, Arthur said, “I love this quote, to be brutally honest. Jason Gillespie is a wonderful coach, wonderful man. Pakistan cricket just continues to shoot itself in the foot. It is its worst enemy.”Arthur believes Pakistan had made the right moves by appointing Jason Gillespie and Gary Kirsten to helm the red-ball and white-ball squads, respectively.However, he expressed regret at the ongoing instability that continues to plague the system. “There are so many good players; they’ve got the resources now; there's so much young talent. They have incredible skill. And yet, it's still so chaotic. It's really disappointing to see.”In a sharp rebuttal to Aaqib Javed’s comments blaming Pakistan’s recent struggles on “too many changes”, Gillespie accused the newly appointed coach of trying to “undermine them” and even called Javed a “clown.”Arthur echoed those concerns, pointing to deeper issues in Pakistan’s cricketing structure. “They had got some really good coaches who could take them forward. But then that machine that works in Pakistan just keeps undermining, and agendas are driven in the media,” he said.ALSO SEE: Jason Gillespie calls Pakistan's Aaqib Javed a 'clown' “It's a jungle out there and I feel desperately sorry for Gary and Jason.

ICC defends protocol as controversy erupts over missing Pakistani representative

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal has stirred controversy with his blunt remarks regarding the absence of a representative from host nation Pakistan during the prize distribution ceremony of the recently concluded ICC Champions Trophy Akmal asserted that Pakistan did not ""deserve"" to have a representative on stage, citing the team's poor performance and lack of respect on the international stage.""The ICC showed us the mirror,"" Akmal said on his YouTube channel. ""The tournament's director (Sumair) was there. He was available, and why wasn't he in the ceremony? It is because we don't deserve to be there. We are not playing good cricket. Minow teams have shown us the mirror.""He further expressed his disappointment with the current state of Pakistan cricket, adding, ""No one discussed how Pakistan hosted the tournament. If we play such cricket, we will be treated like this. If you play for yourself, there will be no respect.""The controversy erupted when Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief executive and Champions Trophy tournament director Sumair Ahmad Syed, who was present at the venue in Dubai, was not invited on stage for the final presentation. India clinched the Champions Trophy title for the third time by defeating New Zealand by four wickets, but Pakistan's absence from the ceremonial proceedings drew widespread criticism back home.The PCB lodged a formal complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC), calling the incident ""unacceptable."" A PCB official was quoted by PTI as stating, ""We have filed a formal complaint with the ICC as what happened is unacceptable to us.""ALSO SEE: 'Pakistan is its worst enemy': Former coach Mickey Arthur backs Jason Gillespie after ‘clown’ jab at Aaqib Javed However, ICC sources have reportedly dismissed the complaint, indicating that the PCB is unlikely to receive a formal explanation or apology. The ICC maintained that the protocol did not mandate the presence of the tournament director on stage.Responding to the criticism, an ICC source explained to PTI, ""If the PCB mandarins look up, even ICC CEO Geoff Allardice wasn't present on stage. The reason is protocol. Sumair Ahmed is an employee of the PCB and not an office-bearer. Also, please check when has a tournament director been on stage for presentation?""During the prize distribution ceremony, BCCI president Roger Binny presented white jackets to Indian players and handed medals to match officials, while ICC chairman Jay Shah presented the trophy to India skipper Rohit Sharma. Other dignitaries on stage included BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia and New Zealand Cricket CEO Roger Twose.","Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal has stirred controversy with his blunt remarks regarding the absence of a representative from host nation Pakistan.
