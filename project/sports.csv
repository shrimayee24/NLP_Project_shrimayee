No more tour, all touchdowns—Taylor Swift to support Travis Kelce every step of the 2025 season







As the NFL gears up for the 2025 season, Taylor Swift is preparing for a quieter, more grounded fall — and it’s all by choice. For the first time since her relationship with Travis Kelce began in 2023, the global superstar will head into football season without the weight of a world tour pulling her in opposite directions.“Taylor is really looking forward to the upcoming NFL season. Not just because she loves supporting Travis, but because for the first full season since they started dating, she’s not juggling a packed tour schedule,” an insider shared exclusively with PEOPLE. The change marks a significant shift in their relationship dynamic, offering both Swift and Kelce the rare luxury of time.In the past two seasons, the couple managed to stay close despite crisscrossing continents and balancing high-pressure careers. “The past two seasons were a whirlwind between performing across multiple countries, long flights, and trying to squeeze in alone time together wherever possible. It wasn’t easy but they made it work,” the source added. Their ability to maintain their connection through it all has become a testament to their commitment.Swift officially wrapped her record-breaking Eras Tour in December 2024 in Vancouver. Spanning five continents and grossing over $2 billion in ticket sales, the tour became the highest-grossing in history.But now, without rehearsals, flights, and nightly performances filling her calendar, the 14-time Grammy winner has space to breathe — and cheer.With her schedule finally free, Swift is expected to be a more regular face in the Arrowhead Stadium stands. “Her schedule is much more open now that the Eras Tour is wrapped and she’s genuinely excited to have the time and flexibility to show up for Travis more consistently,” the source noted. “Taylor plans to be at as many of his games as possible.”That’s good news for Kansas City fans. While all eyes remain on Patrick Mahomes and his offensive arsenal — including Rashee Rice, Xavier Worthy, Hollywood Brown, and, of course, Kelce — the added energy from Swift’s presence brings its own kind of buzz to game day.After their public debut in September 2023, Swift’s regular appearances at Chiefs games, including the AFC Championship and Super Bowl LVIII, became headline moments. Now, without international flights cutting into her weekends, she and Kelce have a chance to settle into something more stable.“It’s a chance for them to settle into more of a routine and they’re both really happy about that,” the insider added.With football season approaching and fewer distractions in the way, Swift and Kelce are entering a new chapter — one that could be defined less by chaos and more by companionship.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld gives first clear look at massive engagement ring after secretive romance with Josh Allen","For the first full season since they started dating, Taylor Swift is not juggling a packed tour schedule.

Patrick Mahomes may have fallen just short of a historic Super Bowl three-peat at the end of the 2024 NFL season, but his life off the field has never looked brighter. As 2025 kicks into high gear, the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback is thriving in both his personal and professional life, celebrating the arrival of his third child and preparing for yet another demanding NFL season.The Mahomes family welcomed a new member on January 12—a baby girl named Golden Raye. She joins her siblings Sterling Sky, born in February 2021, and Patrick “Bronze” Lavon, born in November 2022. With the addition of Golden, the Mahomes household has grown to five, and the couple seems perfectly content with that number.Brittany Mahomes, Patrick’s wife and longtime partner since their high school days, shared her thoughts on growing their family during a candid chat on the WHOOP Podcast. “Nope. We're done, we're done for a while. Three,” she said with a smile. “I don't know, I mean I feel like you can never like say you're done, but I think three is all I need.”Patrick echoed his wife’s words in a press conference shortly after Golden’s birth. “I'm good with three for right now,” he stated. “We'll see down the line, maybe. But my goal was always three. So, we've had three. And we'll stick there for a while and see if we need to come back and get another one later on.”The couple, who began dating in 2012 and married in a stunning Hawaiian ceremony in 2022, have navigated life’s biggest transitions together—from college sweethearts to NFL fame, and now parenthood. Their bond remains strong as they juggle high-profile careers and family responsibilities.As a three-time Super Bowl champion, Mahomes isn’t taking his foot off the gas. He’s already back in action, attending OTAs with the Chiefs ahead of his ninth season. The team is gearing up for a global showcase, with their season opener set in Brazil against the Los Angeles Chargers—marking an international milestone for both the franchise and the league.Away from the stadium lights, Mahomes also opened up about the support he receives from Brittany, especially in terms of inspiration. “I admire my wife Brittany's confidence,” he told People. “Whether it's in business, or supporting our family, she always leads with strength and purpose. That kind of confidence is powerful; it pushes me to be better every day.”With family fulfillment and football focus going hand-in-hand, Mahomes seems more driven than ever.

Jason Kelce can’t believe Eagles fan got him tattooed nude







Jason Kelce has always had a unique relationship with Philadelphia Eagles fans — built on mutual love, grit, and a healthy dose of humor. But even the future Hall of Famer was left scratching his head when a rather bold tribute started making rounds on social media.The buzz began when Crossing Broad shared a video featuring a passionate Eagles fan who got a tattoo of Jason Kelce — completely nude, pin-up style. Tattoo artist Joe the Wizard created the unconventional ink, complete with an eagle drawn strategically over Kelce’s groin area. The tattoo, permanently inked on a forearm, quickly went viral for all the obvious reasons.Jason, known as much for his personality as his dominance on the field, took to X (formerly Twitter) after seeing the tattoo and delivered a classic Kelce reaction:""I'm not sure if I should be offended or flattered."" He later replied to his own post, ultimately deciding, ""I think it’s more flattered, it’s a generous bird, good sized head."" That prompted a playful comment from fellow former NFL star Andrew Whitworth, who added,""I was going to say strong Beak!""Kelce’s reaction struck the perfect balance of humor and humility — much like the man himself, who spent 13 seasons with the Eagles, earning six first-team All-Pro selections and anchoring one of the NFL's toughest offensive lines. Even in retirement, Kelce’s popularity hasn’t faded. If anything, his post-football charisma — now amplified by his podcast and TV appearances — is fueling even more fan devotion.However, no one was more surprised than his wife, Kylie Kelce. Commenting on the original TikTok video, she expressed a mix of amusement and disbelief: ""Excuse me???"" She followed that up with, ""I don’t even know where to start.""The tattoo drama comes right as Kylie prepares for Father’s Day festivities.On the June 12 episode of her Not Gonna Lie podcast, Kylie jokingly considered gifting Jason something outrageous to match his unique fashion sense.""I'd probably buy him a banana hammock,” she laughed, referencing the infamous Borat outfit. Then she added with a smile,“Just kidding. Four kids is enough.”Despite the chaos, Kylie did confirm she’s made dinner plans at a restaurant both she and Jason love: “The key is that Jason also loves it, so that's a win-win right there.”From outrageous tattoos to heartfelt family dinners, the Kelce household continues to live at the intersection of hilarity, humility, and heart — making them one of football’s most beloved families.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s fall Sundays are booked, ready to back Travis Kelce’s quest for another Super Bowl: ""She’s not juggling a packed tour schedule""","A Philadelphia Eagles fan got a nude tattoo of Jason Kelce on their leg.

A complicated family dynamic with children from multiple relationships

Balancing NFL stardom with fatherhood isn’t always easy





Tyreek Hill may be known to NFL fans as the explosive wide receiver for the Miami Dolphins, but off the field, the 31-year-old juggles an equally demanding role: being a father to seven children. Known as ""Cheetah"" for his unmatched speed, Hill’s family life has often sparked headlines—not just for the number of children he has, but also for the complexities that come with raising them while maintaining a high-profile sports career.Tyreek Hill reportedly shares his seven children with multiple women, including his now estranged wife, Keeta Vaccaro. Their youngest, Capri, was born in 2024. Before Vaccaro, Hill was in a long-term relationship with Crystal Espinal, with whom he shares three children: Zev (born in 2014), and twins Nakeem and Nyla (born in 2017). The twins were born after the couple had split, which led Espinal to file a paternity suit to dispel rumors surrounding the timeline of their breakup and the children’s birth.Despite the legal complexities, Hill embraced fatherhood wholeheartedly. “I just feel like I’m truly blessed,” he told USA Today in 2020. “Each and every day I get up, I get a chance to play the game that I love, be around people who are loving, and then I get a chance to be around my kids and be in their lives.I feel like I’m truly blessed.""Managing life as a professional athlete and a father to seven kids is no small feat. Hill candidly discussed this during a 2023 appearance on the It Needed to be Said podcast. “Earlier in my career, bro, I'd come home and my kids would be like, ‘Dad, it's play time, let's play, let's play, let's run around.’ I'm like, 'Bro, I'm tired. Your dad is tired.' Like I got to learn these plays and I gotta watch these films.""These struggles reveal a more human side to the NFL superstar—one that fans rarely see behind the game-day highlights and touchdowns. Over time, Hill has adjusted to the demands of being both a dedicated father and an elite athlete.Also Read: NFL legend Brett Favre opens up on Parkinson’s battle and reveals heartbreaking fear and blames NFL for the diagnosis As Hill prepares for another NFL season, one thing is clear: while the field may be where he shines, home is where his heart—and his biggest challenges—truly lie.","Tyreek Hill is an NFL wide receiver for the Miami Dolphins.

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa Bryant shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip. After the viral response via memes, Vanessa has seemingly closed the chapter as she did not extend the matter any further with any other comments about it afterwards.Also Read: Is Vanessa Bryant pregnant with her 5th child?

How Wiggins Fits With LeBron and Doncic





Theare weighing their options this offseason, and according to a popular NBA analyst, one potential move involves swapping a key forward for a proven NBA champion.The Los Angeles Lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player to bolster their championship aspirations. According to recent reports, the franchise may lean toward the latter by targeting Miami Heat star Andrew Wiggins.Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk suggests the Lakers could package forward Rui Hachimura in a deal to acquire Wiggins from the Miami Heat.""The fit of Rui Hachimura alongside (Luka) Doncic and (LeBron) James has quickly come under scrutiny after a premature first-round exit to the Minnesota Timberwolves,"" Rovenchuk wrote. ""This has led many to believe the Lakers are better off trading the starting forward."" (H/t: Sporting News)Andrew Wiggins could provide the Los Angeles Lakers with much-needed perimeter scoring and defensive versatility. Here’s why this trade could work:- Salary Match: Hachimura ($17 million) plus another expiring contract could match Wiggins’ $28.2 million salary for 2025-26.- Proven Playoff Performer: Wiggins was instrumental in Golden State’s 2022 title run, averaging 17.2 points and 4.5 rebounds per game.- Immediate Upgrade: While Hachimura is solid, Wiggins offers better two-way impact and championship experience.Once considered an underachieving talent in Minnesota, Wiggins revitalized his career with the Golden State Warriors . His improved motor and efficiency made him a key piece in Golden State’s success.However, after a slow start in 2024-25, the Warriors traded him to Miami in the Jimmy Butler deal.Wiggins’ skill set complements the Lakers’ star duo:- Reliable three-point shooting for better floor spacing.- Strong perimeter defense to ease the load on LeBron James.- Playoff-tested mentality, crucial for deep postseason runs.With the Heat struggling, Wiggins may welcome a move to a contender like the Lakers.While Hachimura has been a steady presence, Wiggins represents a clear upgrade for a Los Angeles Lakers team in win-now mode. If Los Angeles can structure the right deal, adding the former Warriors champion could be the move that pushes them back into title contention.","The Los Angeles Lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player.

New look, new game: How Travis Kelce’s transformation reflects a career reboot





Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has once again found himself at the center of attention—but this time, it's not for his jaw-dropping touchdown grabs or viral podcast moments. Instead, the three-time Super Bowl champion has debuted a brand-new look that has fans and critics alike buzzing, and it may say more about his mindset than it does about his hair.Kelce appeared at his cousin Tanner Corum’s wedding in Knoxville, Tennessee, with noticeably longer hair—a sharp departure from the polished, clean-cut image he’s carried for much of his career. Accompanying him was none other than Taylor Swift , making yet another public splash for one of pop culture’s most talked-about couples.While photos of Kelce’s new hairstyle quickly went viral, social media reactions were anything but unanimous. One fan joked, “Looks like someone’s grandfather,” poking fun at the dramatic transformation. But others praised the look, interpreting it as a sign of growth—both personal and professional.And that interpretation may hold weight.After a difficult 2024 season that ended in a crushing Super Bowl LIX loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, retirement whispers grew louder for the 35-year-old tight end. But instead of walking away, Kelce doubled down, signing a reported $17 million extension to stay with the Chiefs.According to those close to the team, Kelce’s energy has shifted. He’s leaned into wellness, taken up padel as a low-impact fitness tool, and slimmed down considerably. “He looks like he’s dropped a few pounds and is moving better than I’ve seen in a while,” a Chiefs insider shared. Even Patrick Mahomes commented that Kelce looks “fresher” and “leaner” heading into 2025.While Kelce’s commitment to excellence on the field is nothing new, his relationship with Taylor Swift has added an extra layer to his off-field persona. Whether it’s showing up at weddings or appearing in commercials, Kelce seems more comfortable than ever in the spotlight.Also Read: Is Travis Kelce preparing for a graceful NFL exit? 5 veterans who might retire after the 2025 season With his physical transformation, mindset reset, and strong connection with Mahomes still intact, the Chiefs veteran is clearly not done chasing greatness.

'Cricketers Aren’t Cattle... ': Harish Thawani on the IPL and Business of Indian Cricket





NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh has backed young left-hander Sai Sudharsan to bat at No. 3 in India’s upcoming five-Test series in England, calling it a crucial opportunity for the youngster.""In my opinion, Sai Sudharsan should play at No.3. He's a left-hander, in top form, and just came off a very impressive IPL. His technique is sound, and I believe he could be the solution at that position,"" Harbhajan said, as quoted by IANS.The Indian squad for the England tour indicates a substantial change. Following the retirement of veterans like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and R Ashwin from the format, an altered 18-member team will compete under 25-year-old Shubman Gill 's leadership, with Rishabh Pant serving as his deputy.Selection head Ajit Agarkar explained that Jasprit Bumrah was not considered for captaincy due to workload management concerns.""Gill is a new captain, and the team is quite young — there's no Rohit, Virat, Pujara, or even Ajinkya Rahane. It's going to be challenging, but I expect our youngsters to rise to the occasion and perform well,"" Harbhajan said.He requested supporters and analysts to remain understanding during the team's development: ""Just because they don't win right away doesn't mean we start criticising them.The team needs support right now. They're going through a transitional phase — a new team, a new era — and I hope it turns out to be a successful one for Indian cricket.""""The team needs to believe in themselves — believe that they can win. This team has the ability,"" Harbhajan added. ""These are the same youngsters — Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant — who broke Australia's fortress at the Gabba. Now it's their turn to make history again. The opportunity is massive, and they should grab it with both hands.""The squad selection features first-time Test call-ups for B. Sai Sudharsan and Arshdeep Singh, whilst Karun Nair and Shardul Thakur return. The exclusion of Shreyas Iyer and Mohammed Shami has generated discussion, with both fans and former captain Sourav Ganguly expressing concerns about Iyer's omission.""Shreyas Iyer is a very fine player. He's proven himself in ODIs, performed in the World Cup, Champions Trophy, and IPL. So yes, he should've been in the squad. But maybe the selectors don't see him as a red-ball player right now,"" Harbhajan said. ""If I were part of the selection committee, I would have considered him. But this is not the end — his journey is long, and he might even be a future ODI captain. One missed tour doesn't mean his career is over.

Stephen Curry’s Influence Extends Beyond Basketball as He Builds a Fanbase the NBA Never Had

Magic Johnson joins Get Up! 👏 His message to Luka Doncic 🗣️ 'IN LA, WE EXPECT CHAMPIONSHIPS!' 🏆





Drawing in a massive following of young fans and rewriting the rules of basketball, Stephen Curry is not just altering the Golden State Warriors — he’s changing the definition of an NBA superstar. Magic Johnson, the Lakers icon, pointed out on ESPN’s Get Up that Curry’s reach is much greater than his remarkable four NBA championships, two MVPs, and exceptional shooting ability. Discover how this superstar has connected generations, influenced the culture, and claimed his position at the top of the game.Magic Johnson didn’t hold back — “kids love Steph Curry… they love how he shoots the basketball, but also how he carries himself.” That feeling really sums up what makes Curry so special—his influence goes way past the usual basketball stats. For sure, Curry broke records—more than 3,390 career three-pointers, the highest in NBA history—and he was the first player to be a unanimous MVP in 2016, helping the Warriors achieve a 73-win season.The magic of Curry lies in his ability to pull in a new generation of fans—kids who admire his long-range shooting and his chill demeanor.This isn’t just luck — Curry is among the NBA’s leading jersey sellers, and his family-oriented image featuring adorable snapshots of his daughter Riley and wife Ayesha—is crucial to his widespread brand influence.Curry's on-court achievements really solidify his impact: he's got four championships (2015, 2017, 2018, 2022), one Finals MVP, and two league MVPs, with one being the only unanimous choice ever. His success has propelled the Warriors to worldwide fame and sparked a change in basketball strategy—now, hitting deep threes is a must.According to Magic Johnson, Curry’s greatness isn’t just in scoring—it’s in making his teammates better: “there’s very few guys… who’s ever made their teammates better.” Curry's selfless style of play, shown through his knack for assisting, leadership qualities, and mentor-like vibe, has built strong trust and unity in Golden State.Also Read: Tyrese Haliburton scores 22 points in NBA Finals Game 3 and then roasts his dad John Haliburton Beyond basketball, Curry's impact keeps growing through charity work and cultural projects.

Peja Stojakovic Accuses Rich Paul of Blackmail in De’Aaron Fox Trade From Sacramento Kings to San Antonio Spurs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/peja-stojakovic-accuses-rich-paul-of-blackmail-in-deaaron-fox-trade-from-sacramento-kings-to-san-antonio-spurs/articleshow/121812022.cms,"(Image Source- Getty Images)

Peja Stojakovic claims Rich Paul controlled De’Aaron Fox trade destination to the San Antonio Spurs





What began as an exciting three-team trade has now turned into a scandal. Peja Stojakovic, the former Sacramento Kings star and executive, has made a shocking claim — he says that agent Rich Paul essentially ""blackmailed"" the Kings into trading De’Aaron Fox to the San Antonio Spurs, not for the best deal, but to push Klutch Sports’ interests.On the NBA Out of Bounds and NBA Mozzart podcasts, Peja Stojakovic mentioned that Rich Paul gave a ""directive"" about where De’Aaron Fox should go, essentially ""blackmailing the Kings"" into sealing the deal with the San Antonio Spurs. Consequently, Sacramento Kings was said to have missed out on the chance to consider offers from other teams, which Peja Stojakovic thinks restricted their negotiation options.At the center of the deal was a three-team swap in February 2025 that sent De’Aaron Fox and Jordan McLaughlin to the San Antonio Spurs, while Zach LaVine, another Rich Paul client, landed in Sacramento King from the Chicago Bulls, along with multiple future draft selections. The Kings received three first-round picks (for 2025, 2027 and 2031) plus three seconds, and flipped prospect Sidy Cissoko for center Jonas Valanciunas.Statistically, De’Aaron Fox had impressive stats in his 17 games with the San Antonio Spurs, averaging 19.7 points, 6.8 assists, and 4.3 rebounds before a finger injury at the end of the season put him out of action.On the other hand, Zach LaVine joined Sacramento’s backcourt, but the team ended up with a 40–42 record and didn’t make the playoffs.Peja Stojakovic believes that if the Kings had explored more options for trading De’Aaron Fox, they could have gotten a better return than just draft picks and one standout player.This isn't the first time Rich Paul has faced accusations of manipulating things behind the scenes: critics were quick to blame him during the Anthony Davis trade to the Lakers back in 2019.Now, the growing claims from a well-respected former executive highlight how influential agents, particularly those representing several high-profile clients, can sway trade dynamics and impact franchise decisions.Peja Stojakovic's statements make us rethink if NBA trades are just a front-office thing or if agents like Rich Paul actually have a say in the matter. If teams are limited by what their clients want, especially with the risk of losing star players, it seems like the power dynamics in trade discussions could be changing. For Kings fans, the lingering question is: was De'Aaron Fox really worth the price they paid?","Peja Stojakovic claims Rich Paul controlled De’Aaron Fox trade destination to the San Antonio Spurs. The former Sacramento Kings star and executive said Paul essentially ""blackmailed"" the Kings into trading De'Aaron Fox to the Spurs, not for the best deal, but to push Klutch Sports' interests.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121812031,imgsize-154396,width-400,resizemode-4/121812031.jpg"

Vaibhav Suryavanshi, a 14-year-old prodigy from Bihar and Rajasthan Royals ’ latest find, has once again captured national attention after smashing a jaw-dropping 190 off just 90 balls in a practice match at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru.The video of his explosive knock, recorded during an India Under-19 team camp, has since gone viral, sending social media into a frenzy.Watch:This latest innings adds to the rapidly growing legend of Suryavanshi, who has already rewritten the record books in his debut IPL season.This year, the teenager became the youngest-ever centurion in men's T20 cricket when he hammered 101 off 38 balls against Gujarat Titans, a blistering knock that included the second-fastest century in IPL history, off just 35 deliveries.Suryavanshi made his IPL debut against Lucknow Super Giants under unexpected circumstances, stepping in for the injured Sanju Samson.He made an immediate impact, smashing his very first ball, bowled by Shardul Thakur, for six, and finishing with a quickfire 34 off 20 balls. By the end of the season, he had tallied 252 runs in seven matches, cementing his place as one of the most promising young talents in Indian cricket.His IPL journey began in unprecedented fashion when, at just 13 years old, he was picked up by Rajasthan Royals for Rs 1.1 crore during the 2025 auction, making him the youngest player ever to sign an IPL contract.But Suryavanshi's brilliance isn’t limited to T20s. He notched a 58-ball century in a four-day match against Australia U-19, played a key role in India’s run to the final of the 2024 ACC U-19 Asia Cup, and famously scored an unbeaten 332 in the Randhir Verma Tournament, a remarkable triple-century in junior cricket.","Vaibhav Suryavanshi scores 190 off just 90 balls in practice match.

After day two of the World Test Championship Final at Lord's, South Africa's position remains challenging despite Australia finishing at 144/8, holding a 218-run lead. The Proteas were earlier bowled out for 138 in their first innings, but their bowlers, particularly Lungi Ngidi and Kagiso Rabada , fought back to keep them in contention.Ngidi, who claimed three crucial wickets on day two, expressed confidence in the team's ability to stay competitive despite the difficult situation.""We were still in the game. They did bowl really well, but at the end of the day, we still had a job to do. The coach asked us whatever we do, to do it with conviction, and if you go out, go out on your own terms. You can also be that guy to turn the game around for the team, that was the mindset,"" Ngidi stated after the day's play.The South African seamer acknowledged his initial struggles but explained how he overcame them with captain Bavuma's support.""It was tough in the first innings, there was no rhythm, it looked like I was fighting a lot while bowling. Couple of nerves coming back after tea, especially knowing who the guys were in the middle, but he (Bavuma) was asking me to do certain things, I just said let me get into my spell, let me get some rhythm and once I felt it was clicking I just kept running with it.""Ngidi drew energy from the crowd's support during his extended bowling spell and remained optimistic about the team's chances.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? ""It was pretty exciting, I could hear my name in one of the corners, that's what actually gives you energy when you are bowling such a long spell, the crowd gets behind and you keep going. We are in a good position now, two balls can wrap it up, and we are focusing on that. If we are chasing anything under 230.. It won't be easy with the bowling line-up they have, but we want to give ourselves the best chance.""Kagiso Rabada continued his impressive performance, following his first-innings five-wicket haul for 51 runs with three more wickets on day two. This achievement elevated him to become South Africa's fifth-leading wicket-taker across all formats.The match remains poised with Australia holding the advantage, but South Africa's bowlers have kept their team's hopes alive with a strong showing on day two.","South Africa bowled out for 138 in their first innings on day two of World Test Championship Final at Lord's.

14 years ago, LeBron James gave his most talked-about comments before the press

Fans respond to the vintage LeBron James video as it resurfaces 14 years later





Fourteen years ago, LeBron James faced the most intense wave of backlash in his career after a crushing NBA Finals loss. Now, a resurfaced clip from that infamous post-game press conference is once again fueling online outrage. Fans are not forgetting his remarks from 2011, and social media has lit up with fresh criticism, as many argue the NBA icon’s words still reflect the arrogance that once made him basketball’s most polarizing figure.In 2010, LeBron’s decision to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers and form a superteam in Miami created an earthquake in the NBA landscape. Fans across the league turned on him overnight, accusing him of abandoning his hometown team and compromising the competitive balance of the sport. When James joined forces with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, the trio became both the most feared and most hated unit in the NBA.The hatred reached its peak in the 2011 NBA Finals. Miami entered the series as heavy favorites but collapsed under the pressure, losing in six games to the Dallas Mavericks. The defeat was especially painful because LeBron, the face of the Heat’s new era, delivered an underwhelming performance throughout the series.Critics and fans rejoiced in his failure, with many calling it the most disappointing moment of his career. Post-game, James delivered the most talked-about presser that still puts the NBA world into frenzy.""All the people that were rooting on me to fail, at the end of the day, they have to wake up tomorrow and have the same life that they had before they woke up today,” James said.“They have the same personal problems they had today. I’m going to continue to live the way I want to live and continue to do the things that I want to do with me and my family and be happy with that. They can get a few days or a few months or whatever the case may be on being happy about not only myself, but the Miami Heat not accomplishing their goal. But they have to get back to the real world at some point,"" he added.It was brutal; instead of taking the conventional route of humility, LeBron’s post-Finals demeanor struck a nerve. While his teammates, including Wade, praised the Mavericks and accepted the loss with grace, James’ tone rubbed people in an unexpected way.His decision to speak candidly about the critics seemed to backfire, especially considering the context of his disappointing on-court showing. Even today, fans are not over the comments despite James accomplishing many great things over the years since.“This why people hate on him. Cause he says dumb s*it like this lol,” one fan wrote on X.Another went to extreme lengths to condemn the now-Lakers legend. “What a bi*ch….What an embarrassment….”“Sooo is the fans that’s rooting for you to fail made you lose the finals Lebron? You really don’t care about the game or the fans. I have one to say to you Lebron just retire and stay away from the game for 6 months and you will see how you will be forgetten,” another slammed James.One fan wrote, “That’s when I lost respect for him. He’s great, but without fans the platform isn’t as big and neither is the money. He reacted to his emotions that not everyone likes him or sees life through his eyes.”“This was so extra and unnecessary, “rooting for me to fail”?! Bro nobody wanted to see you destitute & homeless, they wanted the other team to win, it’s a basketball game. So were the ppl rooting for his team “rooting for the failure” of Dirk?!” another shared.What followed, however, was one of the most impressive comebacks in modern sports. LeBron returned the next season with a sharpened mentality and went on to win back-to-back NBA championships with the Heat in 2012 and 2013. After a successful four-year stint in Miami, he made his way back to Cleveland, where he finally delivered the city its long-awaited championship in 2016.Also Read: LeBron James talks about how the NBA Bubble 2020 was nothing short of a ""mental warfare"" Currently with the Los Angeles Lakers, James has added another title to his name and is still rewriting records in Year 21 of his career.","LeBron James faced the most intense wave of backlash in his career after a crushing NBA Finals loss.

Magic Johnson endorses Kevin Durant to the New York Knicks





NBA legend Magic Johnson feels the New York Knicks’ performance has been pretty slow this season, as they couldn’t make it to the NBA Finals, where only the Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder made it big. While the Knicks are one of the top teams, it has been pretty stressful to see how they performed. But Johnson feels, there’s somebody who could save the Knicks, and it is Kevin Durant.Kevin Durant has had a brilliant career. A 15 time NBA star with a record breaking career, might have to leave Phoenix Suns this summer. The team secured Durant’s spot from Brooklyn Nets back in 2022-2023. The Suns managed to keep stars like Devin Booker and Bradley Beal, but Durant and his team couldn’t perform well.The team knows there are changes required urgently. Even as the Suns are trying hard to get Durant back, there are many speculations round the corner, but there is no conclusive confirmation yet. Teams like the Houston Rockets, San Antonio Spurs, Miami Heat, Minnesota Timberwolves, and New York Knicks have shown interest. Fans could wait for any new update.On Thursday, NBA legend Magic Johnson was on ESPN's ""Get Up.”He feels, Kevin Durant to join the Knicks, since he feels, the team is too slow.He said, “I think Giannis [Antetokounmpo] stays in Milwaukee, but Kevin Durant, that’s an interesting piece. The Knicks are too slow….They’re gonna get a little faster. To me, Kevin Durant will allow them to get faster and be a guy that can help Brunson in the fourth quarter. … I like Kevin Durant playing with the Knicks. I really do.”Further, Johnson explained why Durant is the best idea of Knicks. He said, ""They got to get a little faster, right? And to me, Kevin Durant will allow them to get faster and be a guy that can help Brunson in the fourth quarter.”He said, ""You're relying on Brunson so much, one guy can't get you there. You got to give him some help. Kevin Durant will be a guy who will give you some help on the offensive end. Plus, he's able to put the teams that they play against in foul trouble,” he added.""I like Kevin Durant playing with the Knicks. I really do. A champion, he can teach the other guys how to win the championship. That would be important.

The All-Pro cornerback is showing up, putting in the work at training camp, and making it clear, he’s here to lead.Entering Year 3 of his rookie deal, Sauce Gardner is eligible for a fifth-year option that could extend through 2026.

Houston Texans safety Jimmie Ward was arrested in Texas on a felony family assault charge just as the team wrapped up mandatory minicamp

Jimmie Ward’s off-field reputation under spotlight after felony assault arrest in Texas





Just as the Houston Texans were closing out their offseason program on Thursday morning, unexpected news broke involving one of their veteran leaders. Safety Jimmie Ward, a 12-year NFL veteran and former first-round pick, was arrested in the early hours of June 12 in Magnolia, Texas. The charge? Third-degree felony family assault with allegations of impeding breathing—an incident that now places Ward’s immediate future in question as the Texans head into a pivotal 2025 season.According to jail records from the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office, Jimmie Ward was taken into custody at 5:38 a.m. Thursday and officially booked at 6:37 a.m. He remains held without bond as of Thursday evening.The arrest charge stems from an alleged domestic altercation that escalated to the point of “impeding breathing,” which elevated the incident to a third-degree felony under Texas law.When reached for comment, Texans senior director of communications Omar Majzoub told NFL.com on Thursday, “We are aware of the report involving Jimmie Ward. We are gathering information and have no further comment at this time.”The 33-year-old defensive back was in his third season with Houston after signing a two-year contract with the team in 2023. Prior to joining the Texans, Ward spent nine years with the San Francisco 49ers, who selected him 30th overall in the 2014 NFL Draft.In 126 career games—99 of them starts—he has amassed 549 tackles, 51 passes defensed, and 10 interceptions.In the 2024 season, Ward started 10 games for Houston, logging 48 tackles, four pass breakups, two interceptions, and a defensive touchdown. He was expected to be a key contributor in the Texans’ secondary again this season.Known as “Neko” to friends and fans alike—a name he also uses on his Instagram—Ward has largely maintained a low profile off the field. Though not frequently active on social media, his last post in February was a brand collaboration.In November 2024, he was recognized for participating in a local anti-bullying event at an elementary school, where he addressed students and posed with the Texans’ mascot. “Thank you @texanstoro1 for having me help out with this initiative. Let’s keep attacking bullying together,” he wrote on Instagram at the time.Ward's agent has not responded to media inquiries, and no official legal statement has been released on his behalf.The arrest casts a shadow over what was expected to be a leadership-driven year for Ward, who is entering the final season of his contract. While the Texans have yet to comment further, the timing—on the final day of mandatory minicamp—adds a layer of disruption to an otherwise focused offseason. With the legal process now underway, questions loom about Ward’s availability come training camp and beyond.Also Read: Philadelphia Eagles' Jihaad Campbell faces setback—but Nick Sirianni hints at star potential upon return","Jimmie Ward was arrested in the early hours of June 12 in Magnolia, Texas.

NEW DELHI: Australia skipper Pat Cummins delivered a breathtaking bowling performance at Lord’s, grabbing 6 for 28 to rip through South Africa’s batting order and tilt the World Test Championship final heavily in his side’s favour.Cummins’s masterclass saw him register his 14th five-wicket haul in Tests and reach a major personal milestone, surpassing Indian great Bishan Singh Bedi and matching Richie Benaud with nine five-fors as a Test captain, the second-most in history behind Pakistan's Imran Khan (12).The South African innings collapsed spectacularly on Day 2, skittled out for just 138 in reply to Australia’s modest 212.Cummins, who had already taken two wickets in the morning session, returned after lunch to produce a blistering burst, four wickets for one run in just 17 balls, leaving South Africa reeling.Temba Bavuma and David Bedingham had briefly steadied the ship with a 64-run partnership for the fifth wicket. Bavuma, who started the day on 3 not out, showed some fight with a stylish six off Cummins and a lofted drive off Starc, but was dismissed soon after, caught at cover by a diving Marnus Labuschagne.Cummins struck again quickly after lunch, removing Kyle Verreynne lbw and trapping Marco Jansen for a duck in the same over. He then ended Bedingham’s 111-ball effort by inducing an edge to the keeper before the lower order completely disintegrated.A farcical run-out of Keshav Maharaj only added to South Africa’s woes, and Cummins fittingly wrapped up the innings with his 300th Test wicket, dismissing Kagiso Rabada , caught at deep square leg by Beau Webster.With this performance, Cummins not only reaffirmed his status as one of the premier fast bowlers of his generation but also etched his name alongside the game’s greats as a captain who leads by fiery example.","Cummins takes 6 for 28 as South Africa are skittled out for 138 on Day 2.

Depth moves signal doubt beneath the surface

New mindset, same pressure





The Miami Dolphins have gone all-in on Tua Tagovailoa, handing the quarterback a massive $212 million extension. But as the 2025 season approaches, the deal is under increasing scrutiny—with durability doubts, playoff pressure, and a growing chorus of critics questioning if he’s truly a franchise cornerstone.The four-year deal, signed in 2024, includes over $147 million in guarantees—making Tua Tagovailoa one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in the NFL. But Miami’s commitment comes with risk, Tagovailoa has dealt with multiple concussions over his career, and he missed significant time as recently as late 2024. His injury history has raised persistent concerns about whether he can stay on the field long enough to deliver postseason success.While he started all 17 games in 2023 and led the league in passing yards, playoff struggles and cold-weather inconsistencies have kept critics vocal. With a competitive AFC field, the Dolphins know they need more than regular-season fireworks from their franchise QB.To hedge their bet, Miami brought in Zach Wilson on a one-year deal this offseason and added rookie Quinn Ewers to the quarterback room. The message is clear- while Tua remains the starter, the Dolphins aren’t leaving themselves exposed if injuries or performance issues return.Even within the building, the approach seems to have shifted from blind faith to calculated risk. Coaches have publicly supported Tua, but their offseason moves reflect a front office preparing for multiple scenarios.Tagovailoa, for his part, appears aware of what’s at stake. This offseason, he’s spoken openly about improving decision-making and protecting himself more. He reported to minicamp leaner and more focused, signaling a renewed mindset ahead of what could be the defining season of his career.Also read: Tua Tagovailoa faces uncertain future in Miami as Dolphins' faith fades and rebuild rumors grow louder The 2025 season won’t just be about wins—it will be about proving Tua can stay healthy, lead deep playoff runs, and justify one of the league’s most lucrative quarterback deals.

Australia captain Pat Cummins reached the milestone of 300 Test wickets while leading his team to a commanding position in the World Test Championship final against South Africa at Lord's on June 13, 2025. After two days of play, Australia reached 144-8 in their second innings, establishing a lead of 218 runs with two wickets remaining.A total of 28 wickets fell across the first two days as both teams' batsmen struggled for runs on a challenging pitch.Cummins delivered an outstanding bowling performance, taking 6-28 on the second day to help dismiss South Africa for 138 runs, giving Australia a first-innings lead of 74 runs.An eighth-wicket partnership of 61 between Alex Carey (43) and Mitchell Starc (16 not out) strengthened Australia's position at stumps.""It's set up pretty well. The mood in the changing room is pretty positive. It was a great partnership and a good way to end the day,"" Cummins said.""After two days it's pretty close to 50-50. It's a pretty good Test match. Some blokes have got themselves in and looked comfortable out there, but a lot of other guys haven't,"" Cummins added regarding the bowlers' dominance.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Cummins attributed the rapid progress of the match to both pitch conditions and bowling quality.""Both teams have bowled really well, really disciplined. There haven't been many half-volleys,"" he said.""The trend of the game is that the runs are coming down.

It's something I've always thought about. It's a pretty good sign of durability and longevity,"" Cummins remarked about his milestone.South Africa's top scorer David Bedingham , who made 45 runs, acknowledged the challenging conditions.""It's a fairly tricky pitch, but I think when you have six quality seamers on a tricky pitch it obviously makes batting tough,"" Bedingham said.Despite trailing in the match, Bedingham expressed confidence in South Africa's ability to chase down the target.""It is an amazing chance and we are very excited about the opportunity to win. It could go either way but there is a lot of belief,"" he said.""I think the pitch is slowing down a bit and maybe in the fourth innings it will go a bit straighter. Hopefully, we can get those runs,"" Bedingham added, as South Africa aims for their first major global title in 28 years.","Australia reach 144-8 in their second innings, establishing a lead of 218 runs with two wickets remaining.

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

MLC: Venky Harinarayan on growing cricket in the USA, AI-driven teams and the Olympic boost





NEW DELHI: Already retired from T20Is following India’s T20 World Cup triumph, and having stepped away from Test cricket ahead of the five-match series in England, the two stalwarts — Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma — will be seen in action when India tour Australia for a three-match ODI series starting in October. Along with the ODIs, India will also play five T20Is during the tour.Cricket Australia CEO Todd Greenberg said Australia is gearing up for a massive summer of cricket, featuring both the Indian men's and women's teams.Greenberg also shared his excitement about the limited-overs series in October-November 2025, which could potentially be the last time Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma don the ODI jersey Down Under.""It's a massive summer of cricket, highlighted by both the Indian women's and men's teams. Also, the Ashes is here. And for the first time in nearly two decades, Australian cricket will be playing international matches in every single capital city and territory across the entire country — which, you know, is amazing when you think about the logistical exercise that goes with that,"" Greenberg told reporters.""But to answer the question — look, there's a lot of work going into bespoke marketing plans for every game in every city.Some of those will be nuanced to local markets — whether we're playing, you know, in Far North Queensland when South Africa are here, or in our big cities when both India’s men's and women's teams are visiting. So, a lot of work is going into that.""""I think we saw real momentum last year on the back of the BGT series — you know, some record-breaking ticket sales. And I anticipate that we’ll see a number of sellouts across the summer, really starting in August and going through until March. This might be a summer like we’ve never seen before, just in terms of the amount of content. And if you think about the quality of the players coming, particularly from India — this might be the last time we get to see Virat Kohli or Rohit Sharma play in our country. If that’s the case — who knows, it might not be — but if it is, we want to make sure we give them a great send-off and acknowledge the incredible contribution they've made to international cricket,"" Greenberg added.Greenberg also addressed past racism incidents during India’s previous tours to Australia.During the Sydney Test in 2021, Indian pacer Mohammed Siraj faced racial abuse from sections of the crowd. Both Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah were targeted, prompting the Indian team management to lodge an official complaint with match referee David Boon.""Well, my message is a simple one: everyone should feel welcome and safe in any format of our game here in this country. If there are any instances of inappropriate behavior, we will have zero tolerance for it. People who behave poorly in those areas will be dealt with accordingly,"" Greenberg said.""As I’ve said, I want our Indian fans — in fact, all fans, whether they’re English fans coming for the Ashes or Indian fans arriving for the Border-Gavaskar series — to feel welcome, to be able to support their teams, but never to be abused. Anyone engaging in abusive behavior will be removed from our stadiums. We’ll also continue our efforts in educating fans and fostering a respectful environment.""We’re aware that, from time to time, people may do the wrong thing — but we will not excuse that behavior. Those individuals will be removed because attending a match should be considered a privilege, not a right. If you don’t behave in the way we expect, you won’t be welcomed. We want to ensure that Indian players and fans — and fans from all countries — feel very welcome and safe at every one of our venues,"" he added.","India will tour Australia for a three-match ODI series starting in October.

Australia maintained their advantage in the World Test Championship final against South Africa at Lord's on Thursday, led by captain Pat Cummins 's exceptional bowling performance and Alex Carey's crucial 43 runs. Despite a dramatic collapse that saw Australia reduced to 73-7 in their second innings, they ended the day at 144-8, establishing a substantial lead of 218 runs.Pat Cummins delivered a remarkable spell, taking four wickets for just one run as South Africa were bowled out for 138 in response to Australia's first-innings total of 212. Cummins finished with impressive figures of 6-28, reaching the milestone of 300 Test wickets.The second day witnessed a flurry of wickets, with 28 dismissals across both teams on a pitch that offered some assistance to fast bowlers but remained playable. The match, originally scheduled for five days, could potentially conclude before the third day's end. Kagiso Rabada and Lungi Ngidi led South Africa's bowling attack in Australia's second innings. Rabada, who had already claimed 5-51 in the first innings, continued his strong performance with 3-44, while Ngidi contributed with 3-35.South Africa's captain Temba Bavuma and David Bedingham provided the only substantial resistance during their first innings, sharing a fifth-wicket partnership of 64 runs. Bavuma scored 36 while Bedingham contributed 45.The Australian collapse began when Rabada dismissed Usman Khawaja for six and Cameron Green for a duck in the 11th over. Green's brief appearance resulted in just four runs from five balls across both innings. Marnus Labuschagne, in his debut as a Test opener, was caught behind for 22 off Marco Jansen. Beau Webster, who had top-scored with 72 in Australia's first innings, fell lbw to Ngidi, reducing Australia to 48-4.The situation worsened for Australia when Cummins was bowled by Ngidi's yorker, leaving them at 73-7. However, Carey and Mitchell Starc mounted a recovery, sharing an eighth-wicket partnership of 61 runs before Carey was dismissed lbw by Rabada. The day's final over saw a missed opportunity when Jansen dropped Starc, then on 14, off Wiaan Mulder's bowling. Starc remained unbeaten on 16 at stumps.Cummins's outstanding bowling performance earned him a place on the Lord's honours board.

“Goat was on to something”: Kevin Durant’s bold reaction to resurfaced Michael Jordan clip

Resurfaced video reveals Michael Jordan’s true pick for the best player



Michael Jordan chooses between LeBron & Kobe





Kevin Durant rarely misses when it comes to basketball—and apparently, not when it comes to legacy debates either. The Phoenix Suns superstar recently came across a resurfaced Michael Jordan clip that’s catching fire again on social media. In the video, Jordan jokingly mentions Durant while weighing in on the infamous Kobe Bryant vs. LeBron James question. Now, more than a decade later, Durant’s sharp but playful response has reignited the conversation, with fans and media alike taking notice.It all started when a throwback clip from 2013 began circulating across social platforms this week. In it, NBA legend Michael Jordan is asked one of basketball’s most heated questions: Kobe or LeBron? Sitting down with analyst Ahmad Rashad for the “Michael Jordan at 50” special, Jordan seemed momentarily caught off guard before throwing out an unexpected name: “Kevin Durant.”Though Jordan immediately laughed and clarified that he was joking—“Naw, I’m just kidding,” he said—the clip has lived on in NBA lore as a light-hearted but fascinating moment. And this week, it got new life when Durant himself saw the post and added fuel to the fire.“Goat was on to something,” Durant wrote in the comments section, flipping the joke into a subtle flex that left fans buzzing. Kevin Durant , who turns 37 this year and will enter his 18th NBA season, is widely recognized as one of the most skilled scorers in league history.The two-time NBA champion and two-time Finals MVP has averaged 27.2 points per game across his career while maintaining an elite shooting clip of over 50%. With that kind of resume, even a joke from Jordan feels like a nod worth keeping in the vault.The moment drew even more attention thanks to another clip included in the video—this one featuring a resurfaced quote from Kobe Bryant that added weight to the conversation. “Kevin Durant. That was the one I retired without being able to figure out how I can stop him,” Bryant once admitted. That rare praise from one all-time great to another only added gravity to Durant’s reaction.The viral interview dates back to early 2013, when Michael Jordan was reflecting on his legacy ahead of his 50th birthday. The special, titled “Michael Jordan at 50,” gave the six-time NBA champion a chance to weigh in on the league’s future—and the players most often compared to him.When asked “Kobe or LeBron?” by Rashad, Jordan initially responded with a smirk and said “Kevin Durant” before laughing it off. Then, he gave a more measured answer.“In terms of dominance of the game of basketball, at this stage it’s LeBron,” Jordan acknowledged at the time, crediting James for his physical impact on the game during his Miami Heat prime.But Jordan wasn’t done. He added a clear preference for Bryant’s mentality and hunger.“Championship-wise, it’s Kobe Bryant . He wants it so bad and he’s willing to go to the extreme,” Jordan said. “Guarding a point guard at the age of 34, playing 38 minutes, 40 minutes, that’s ludicrous.”Jordan even suggested that Bryant shared his obsessive drive for greatness: “He’s cursed as much as I am.”When it came to championships—a standard Jordan always held in the highest regard—he summed it up plainly: “Five (rings) beats one.”More than a decade later, the Kobe vs. LeBron debate remains heated—but the narrative has evolved. LeBron James , who joined the Lakers in 2018, now holds four championship rings and recently became the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, the first player ever to surpass 50,000 career points. His longevity and all-around excellence have kept him in the GOAT conversation.Bryant, who tragically passed away in 2020, remains a symbol of competitive spirit. He finished his career with five rings and a 5–2 record in the Finals, while Jordan, famously, went 6–0.Also Read: LeBron James or Kobe Bryant? Dwight Howard’s shocking pick in the legendary NBA debate between his two former teammates What began as a quick-witted joke from Jordan in a 2013 interview has taken on new life in 2025, especially now that Durant has joined the chat. With Kobe openly praising Durant’s unguardable game, and Jordan once (even jokingly) tossing his name into the GOAT conversation, Durant’s legacy is secure.","Kevin Durant responded to a resurfaced Michael Jordan clip from 2013.
