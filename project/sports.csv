NEW DELHI: India's new coach-captain duo of Gautam Gambhir and Suryakumar Yadav is set to make an immediate mark against a struggling Sri Lankan side as the well-known South Asian adversaries clash in a series of limited-overs matches, commencing with a trio of T20Is on Saturday.Gambhir, a two-time World Cup champion, now holds the reins as India's head coach, while the T20I captaincy has been entrusted to Suryakumar, one of the format's most prolific run-scorers.Sri Lanka, the victors of the 2014 T20 World Cup, find themselves navigating through tumultuous times in the aftermath of their early exit from the previous edition.In the wake of the disappointment in the 2024 T20 World Cup, captain Wanindu Hasaranga, coach Chris Silverwood, and consultant coach Mahela Jayawardene stepped down from their positions.The promising batsman Charith Asalanka has been appointed as the new captain, as Sri Lanka, akin to India, ventures into uncharted territory, seeking to improve their prospects.The first T20I match between India (IND) and Sri Lanka (SL) is set to take place on July 27 at 7:00 PM IST at the Pallekele International Stadium in Sri Lanka.The two teams have faced each other in 29 T20I matches so far, with India emerging as the dominant side, securing 19 wins compared to Sri Lanka's 9 victories. One match was abandoned due to rain.The pitch at Pallekele Stadium is generally favourable for batting. However, as the match progresses, the surface is expected to slow down, bringing spinners into play. Pacers will need to focus on hitting the deck hard and varying their pace and length to succeed on this track.Top-order batters are likely to be the safest picks for this match. Middle-order batters who are proficient against spin could also be valuable. Spinners are expected to dominate on this surface, making them potentially more rewarding choices.: The young Indian opener is in excellent form and can take on bowlers under various conditions, making him a reliable pick. He has shown great temperament and technique in domestic cricket and IPL, and if given a chance, he can prove to be a valuable asset for the Indian team in this series against Sri Lanka.: The newly appointed T20I skipper has been a dominant force in this format for the past few seasons and has a strong record against Sri Lanka. His ability to play unorthodox shots and score runs at a brisk pace makes him a dangerous player in the shortest format of the game. As a captain, he will be looking to lead from the front and set an example for his team.: This Sri Lankan middle-order batter has been impactful in the Lankan Premier League and is entering the series with good momentum, potentially making him a high point earner. He has the ability to play spin well and can also bowl a few overs of off-spin if required. His all-round skills make him a valuable asset for the Sri Lankan team.: The Indian all-rounder can make significant contributions with both bat and ball. On this surface, his bowling could be particularly impactful, and his batting ability adds to his value. He has been in good form recently and has shown that he can be a match-winner on his day. His left-arm spin can be difficult to play on turning tracks, and his batting down the order can provide the much-needed impetus to the Indian innings.Suryakumar Yadav (c), Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rinku Singh, Riyan Parag, Rishabh Pant (wk), Sanju Samson (wk), Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Ravi Bishnoi, Arshdeep Singh, Khaleel Ahmed, Mohammed Siraj.: Dinesh Chandimal, Avishka Fernando, Kusal Mendis (wk), Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Perera, Charith Asalanka (c), Wanindu Hasaranga, Kamindu Mendis, Dasun Shanaka, Chamindu Wickramasinghe, Binura Fernando, Asitha Fernando, Dilshan Madushanka, Matheesha Pathirana, Maheesh Theekshana, Dunith Welalage.Wicketkeeper: Rishabh PantBatters: Suryakumar Yadav, Kamindu Mendis, Pathum Nissanka, Yashasvi JaiswalAll-rounders: Axar Patel, Hardik PandyaBowlers: Ravi Bishnoi, Arshdeep Singh, Maheesh Theekshana, Matheesha Pathirana",Gautam Gambhir and Suryakumar Yadav will captain India against Sri Lanka.

'Toh abhi kar lenge pura...': Captain Suryakumar Yadav on amending Team India head coach Gautam Gambhir's old 'regret',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/toh-abhi-kar-lenge-pura-captain-suryakumar-yadav-on-amending-team-india-head-coach-gautam-gambhirs-old-regret/articleshow/112054851.cms,"Watch Gambhir's old statement:

Suryakumar Yadav की बैटिंग देख क्या बोले Gautam Gambhir? KKR | Team India

NEW DELHI: Team India captain Suryakumar Yadav was recently reminded of a statement by the new head coach Gautam Gambhir during a pre-match press conference ahead of the first T20I against Sri Lanka in Pallekele. Gambhir, recalling their time at Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) a decade ago, expressed regret over not fully utilizing Suryakumar’s potential.In response, Suryakumar humorously suggested that the full potential could now be utilized.Reflecting on their past, Gambhir had noted that the team combinations at that time did not allow for Suryakumar to be placed at the No. 3 spot, a decision he now regrets. Suryakumar played for KKR in the IPL from 2014 to 2017 under the captaincy of Gambhir, before moving to Mumbai Indians ""A leader's biggest role is to bring out the best in a player. In my seven-year captaincy stint, if there is one regret that I have, it is the fact that we couldn't utilize the full potential of Surya. There were many reasons for it - the combination, etc. But, you can only play one batter at No. 3. As a leader, you think about the other 10 players as well,"" Gambhir had said in an interview with Sportskeeda.""If Surya had batted at No. 3, he would have been a lot more effective, but he was effective at No. 7 as well,"" he added.Responding to the comments, Suryakumar remarked with humor, ""Toh abhi kar lenge pura potential ko use (He will utilize his full potential now).""He praised Gambhir for his understanding and shared insights into their strong relationship as coach and captain.""Even when I say nothing sometimes, he understands what I want. So this bond is very special between coach and captain. I am very excited for this journey ahead,"" Suryakumar stated.Suryakumar, at 33, is currently leading the T20I team in Sri Lanka and has reunited with his former KKR captain with Gambhir now taking on the role of head coach of the Indian men's team. Since making his debut for India in 2021, Suryakumar has established himself as one of the top T20I batters in the world.In 68 matches, Suryakumar has scored 2340 runs at an average of 43.33 and a strike rate of 167.74, with four hundreds and 19 fifties.","Team India captain Suryakumar Yadav was reminded of a statement by new head coach Gautam Gambhir during a pre-match press conference ahead of the first T20I against Sri Lanka in Pallekele.

However, he won't be the vice-captain of the side, like he was during the T20 World Cup.After Rohit Sharma's retirement from T20Is, the BCCI decided to not just hand over the captaincy to Suryakumar Yadav but also changed the vice-captain from Hardik to Shubman Gill in both T20Is and ODIs. Rohit will continue to lead the team in the 50-over format.The Sri Lanka tour will see India playing three T20Is and three ODIs.According to the BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar, the decision to not make Hardik the T20I captain was based on his brittle fitness of late.Besides his successful return to form in the T20 World Cup after a horrific Indian Premier League season as the captain of Mumbai Indians, Hardik went through a tough period personally because of separation with his wife, Natasa Stankovic.But he has shown a lot of energy in training on the tour of Sri Lanka and will hope to continue from where he left in the T20 World Cup final, where his three wickets turned the tables on South Africa to script India's come-from-behind seven-run win to lift the trophy.The tour also marks the debut of Gautam Gambhir as India's head coach since replacing Rahul Dravid in the role at the end of the T20 World Cup last month.",Hardik Pandya was spotted trying his hands at leg-spin in Anil Kumble style at the nets during India's training session in Pallekele ahead of the first T20I on Saturday.

McKeon, standout performer since the Tokyo Olympics, participated in her final Games and now holds a total of 12 Olympic medals.""Wow. I don't keep track of that kind of stuff ... it's an honour really,"" McKeon told Australian media. She underscored the team effort, including contributions from Bronte Campbell and Olivia Wunsch.This victory marks the fourth consecutive Olympic gold for Australia in this event, with their time second only to their own world record of 3:27.96 set last year. Australia has held the world record since 2014 and has lowered it four times since.The gold medal was particularly significant for Shayna Jack, who missed the Tokyo Olympics due to a contested doping ban.""I already proved my redemption by coming here, so this is all fun and games for me, I'm just enjoying the experience,"" Jack was quoted as saying by AFP.Jack tested positive for the muscle growth agent ligandrol in June 2019, leading to a four-year ban despite her claims of innocence and contamination.

Hardik Pandya: Ex-New Zealand cricketer agrees with Team India's call to not make Hardik Pandya captain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/will-hardik-pandya-become-india-captain-again-ex-new-zealand-cricketer-advises-the-all-rounder-to-concentrate-on-his-skills/articleshow/112073524.cms,"Top Picks For You 1st T20I: Suryakumar Yadav-Gautam Gambhir regime starts with 43-run win against Sri Lanka

NEW DELHI: The likelihood of Hardik Pandya serving as India's captain in the near future appears slim, according to former New Zealand all-rounder Scott Styris . Styris supports Indian team management's decision to avoid appointing Pandya as captain due to concerns about the added pressures and responsibilities that could affect his performance and fitness.""I wouldn't have personally made Hardik Pandya my captain either.I think that's a smart choice solely for one reason, and that is as an all-rounder. Skills-wise, he is India's best all-rounder. He is phenomenal. But you want him to be consistently fit,"" Styris told News18.Pandya's recurrent injuries and the physical demands of bowling are factors contributing to Styris' assessment.""At the moment, how he's in and out with his injuries, you know, bowling is really hard. It takes a lot out of you and your body. So sometimes, adding all the responsibility of captaincy is not necessarily a good thing because there's just too much to do. I'd love to see Hardik Pandya just concentrate on getting those skills right, batting and bowling. And then you can look at captaincy a little bit later,"" explained Styris.Styris also emphasized the significant role Pandya plays as a bowler, especially in light of fitness concerns surrounding key pacers like Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami . Pandya's presence as a sixth bowler can be invaluable for the team.""These fast bowling stocks are the one area where India probably needs a little bit more help, which is why I like the selection of these youngsters. Anytime Bumrah is not here, your team is going to be weaker. He's as good as anyone who's ever played the game, especially the white ball. So the decision to give him a rest, you totally understand. You've got to make sure that he's fresh and ready for some of the other challenges that India have in front of them,"" Styris added.""You want more out of Hardik Pandya. That's why I like the decision not to make him captain because I really want to see him stand up with a dominant role with the ball more than anything,"" he concluded.The consensus among experts like Styris appears to be that Hardik Pandya should focus on his all-rounder capabilities and maintaining fitness. This would allow him to contribute effectively without the added burden of captaincy.","Former New Zealand all-rounder Scott Styris says Hardik Pandya should focus on his skills and fitness instead of captaincy. Pandya's recurrent injuries and the physical demands of bowling are factors contributing to Styr is' assessment.

They collected just 21 points from 22 games and lost as many as 11 games.Speaking ahead of the game, Jamil said, “We’re on home turf, but that’s no excuse to take things lightly. We must approach this game with utmost seriousness and respect for our opponents. A good start is crucial, and every single player and staff member is focused and geared up for this match. We can’t afford to underestimate them — it’s time to put in the work and make our home advantage count.”The team has been putting in the hours and began their preparation midway into July. Jamil has also made numerous signings after penning a 2-year contract extension with the club. This week itself they have announced the recruitment of Javi Hernandez and Stephen Eze among the foreigners and Aniket Jadhav, Shubham Sarangi and Ashutosh Mehta among the Indians.Although Jamil has made it aptly clear that Assam Rifles are not to be taken lightly, it’s their second game against Chennaiyin that will test them to the fullest.Like JFC, the Marina Machans have also bolstered their squad with a number of signings and will be looking to put it past the hosts. The match will also see Own Coyle making a comeback to the city where he holds a special positon in the hearts of the JFC fans after he guided them to their only Shield win three seasons back.Meanwhile, a grand opening ceremony will be held at JRD Tata Sports Complex earlier in the afternoon. Besides cultural activities, the Indian Army has planned to hold fly pass by helicopters, sky diving by paratroopers from the Akash Ganga Team of Indian Air Force and a fixed wing aircraft fly pass.","Jamshedpur FC will begin their Durand Cup campaign against Assam Rifles FT on Sunday.

A total of 85 boats carried nearly 7,000 athletes from 205 countries along the river. The Olympic flag was carried into Trocadero by Floriane Issert, a cloaked rider who had earlier galloped down the Seine on a metal horse draped in a cape adorned with the Olympic rings. Issert concluded her ride at the closing point of the ceremony before handing over the flag to be hoisted, as per tradition, The Independent reported.The 'Parade of Nations', which usually features sportspersons walking on the running track of a stadium, witnessed a break from tradition as athletes from 205 countries and one refugee team navigated the Seine on boats, which mesmerised the audience.Despite the looming threat of heavy rain before and during the ceremony, the participants remained undeterred, showcasing their resilience and determination.The ceremony also gave a sweet nod to 'Hindi' as it was among the six languages used in infographics to pay tribute to the contribution of prominent French women during the segment titled 'sisterhood'.The Indian contingent, consisting of 78 athletes and officials, made their entrance at the 84th position during the event. The contingent was led by flag-bearers PV Sindhu, two-time Olympic medallist; and A Sharath Kamal, a legendary table tennis player.The ceremony concluded with a sparkling performance by Celine Dion, who lit up the drenched Paris streets. French Olympic gold medalists Marie-Jose Perec and Teddy Riner had the honor of lighting the Paris 2024 Olympic cauldron, which will burn throughout the duration of the Games. A stunning laser show illuminated the Eiffel Tower, attempting to pierce through the gloomy skies over Paris.The show, produced by director Thomas Jolly, included appearances by Lady Gaga, Zinedine Zidane, and even The Minions. Celine Dion's return to the stage was a highlight, especially considering her recent diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that causes muscle spasms and rigidity. The condition had led the multiple Grammy winner to cancel her tour dates for 2023 and 2024.","The iconic emblem, featuring five colored rings, appeared to be hoisted incorrectly, with the rings in the wrong positions.

Witty Ashish Nehra leaves Yashasvi Jaiswal speechless with Virat-Rohit remark - Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/witty-ashish-nehra-leaves-yashasvi-jaiswal-speechless-with-virat-rohit-remark-watch/articleshow/112073595.cms,"WATCH

India didn't face much trouble in beating hosts Sri Lanka in the first T20I international in Pallekele on Saturday once their batsmen had put the home team under pressure with a total in excess of 200, but Ashish Nehra 's witty observation after the match left opener Yashasvi Jaiswal speechless.Led by skipper Suryakumar Yadav's half-century (58 off 26 balls), India's top-order fired all cylinders to take the team to a commanding 213 for 7 after the Lankan skipper Charith Asalanka won the toss and put the visitors in to bat.Jaiswal (40 off 21 balls) and Shubman Gill (34 off 16 balls) gave India a dominating start of 74 runs before both fell on consecutive deliveries. Surya and Rishabh Pant (49 off 33 balls) then entertained the crowd with a stroke-filled 76-run partnership, which was enough to push India past the 200-run mark despite the middle-order faltering.Talking to Jaiswal after the match, former India pacer Ashish Nehra stumped the young batsman with his comment and he could only smile about that with a you-caught-me expression.""Ajay Jadeja asked you what's the difference when Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma were there (to open in T20Is). According to me, there is just one difference. If Virat and Rohit were still playing this format, then whatever strokes we saw from you today, you would have played those in the nets. Now you are getting to play those shots in the match because they (Virat and Rohit) are not there,"" quipped Nehra.Both Virat and Rohit had announced their T20I retirement after India won the T20 World Cup last month.Nehra's cheeky comment left everyone in splits and the video clip of the small interaction was shared by Sony Sports Network on X (formerly Twitter).Coming back to the match, Sri Lanka started their stiff run-chase on a positive note, as their openers Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis added 84 runs in 8.3 overs. Arshdeep Singh (2 for 24) broke that stand by dismissing Mendis (45 off 27 balls). But Nissanka's bat continued to blaze away in another quickfire stand of 56 with Kusal Perera.But once Axar Patel (2 for 38) cleaned up Nissanka (79 off 48 balls) with his left-arm spin, the Lankans succumbed to the scoreboard pressure and the climbing required run-rate.Riyan Parag (3 for 5) made the most of that pressure and struck thrice in the 8 balls he bowled in the match, which took the fight out of the home team.",India beat Sri Lanka in first T20I international in Pallekele on Saturday.

Will support national team by developing players at Inter Kashi: Habas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/will-support-national-team-by-developing-players-at-inter-kashi-habas/articleshow/112029904.cms,"Last season, Habas guided Mohun Bagan Super Giant to the ISL Shield triumph

Panaji:

Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa ’s Manolo Marquez , who will now do a dual job of coaching club and country.Habas remains the most successful coach in the Indian Super League (ISL), the top-tier league in the country, and believed he had more than a decent chance of stepping into the boots of Igor Stimac, sacked last month for his failure to steer India to the third round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers.“I think I deserved the nomination (to coach the national team),” Habas told TOI after completing a surprise move to Inter Kashi in the I-League , Indian football’s second tier, on Thursday. “We won three (ISL) titles, played four finals and six semifinals. Within football (fraternity), I feel like another Indian. I have coached many players of the national team. I was not chosen, and I accept it. I will support the national team by developing players at Inter Kashi. It’s what I have done until now, and what I will continue to do.”Last season, Habas guided Mohun Bagan Super Giant to the ISL Shield triumph. But while title victories normally assure coaches of a contract extension, the experienced Spaniard was not considered, reportedly due to concerns over his health. Even while selecting the national coach, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) executive committee members made a mention of the 67-year-old’s age and health.Habas though said he has the same “strength and enthusiasm” as when he first arrived in India to take charge of Atletico de Kolkata and won the maiden ISL trophy in 2014.“I am very disappointed and saddened by the treatment that some journalists and others have given me, speaking about my health problems. Someone did it to justify my departure from Mohun Bagan, and at the same time, prevent me from training the national team. My medical tests are currently perfect,” said Habas.The serial trophy winner has won the ISL twice with ATK (2014, 2019-20) and the ISL Winner’s Shield with Mohun Bagan last season. Now, his focus is on ensuring that Inter Kashi – started last season – win the I-League and move to the ISL.Explaining his decision to take over Inter Kashi, Habas said the club’s “proposal is attractive, serious and ambitious.”“It offers me guarantees and seriousness to develop my work,” he said. “At the same time, it is a great responsibility to be able to have a great impact sportingly in such an important and fascinating region of India as Uttar Pradesh.”Besides winning trophies in India, Habas had a stint as Bolivia’s head coach and finished runner-up in the 1997 Copa America.Inter Kashi said Habas will spearhead a long-term project aimed at creating a sustainable football ecosystem in Uttar Pradesh. “This initiative will focus on the promotion of Inter Kashi to the ISL, ensuring the club competes at the highest level of Indian football.“Habas will also help Inter Kashi devise a concrete player pathway to Europe, collaborating with Inter Escaldes to establish a pathway for Indian players to gain opportunities in Andorra, providing them with invaluable international exposure and experience,” the club said in a statement on Thursday.","Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa’s Manolo Marquez.

However, Anees noted that the transfer window has seen seven of their players move to ISL clubs, presenting both a setback and an opportunity for other players to step up and fill the void.""Since the transfer window began, seven of our players have moved into ISL clubs. So we had a lot of players getting transferred to other clubs. It's a setback for us and a bit difficult for us to have the same quality of players to compete at the higher levels.

Five first-team players – Samik Mitra, Bikash Yumnam, Vincy Barretto, Alexander Romario and Irfan Yadwad – have been included in the camp. What is the plan for them?

What do you make of the youngsters in the squad?

How has the preparation been so far?

Coyle is well known for his positive brand of football. Will the reserve team have a similar style of play going forward?

You have reunited with Coyle, after having worked at Jamshedpur FC. How does it feel?

CHENNAI: Chennaiyin FC ’s newly appointed assistant coach Noel Wilson said the club opted to play with the reserve team in the Durand Cup to ensure that the first-team gets a six-week pre-season ahead of the Indian Super League (ISL). In an interaction with TOI at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium – Chennaiyin’s current training base – Wilson spoke about head coach Owen Coyle’s plan for the main team, Durand Cup preparation and more.Excerpts:You (first team) need to have a six-week pre-season (ahead of the ISL), which is about one-and-a-half months. I think, after the Durand Cup, there is going to be a gap of two months. You cannot be stagnant in that period. Coyle will have better ideas. He does not want the main team to play in the Durand Cup as there are chances of players getting injured. Maybe he does not want to take risk with the main-team players. He knows what is right.The players who have come here did not get much game time last season. When you play competitive matches, your confidence level will increase. After playing here, they will perform better once they return to the main team.There are some young players who have good quality. They need the experience and exposure of playing with the bigger guys (seniors). The difference between playing in a reserve team and a senior team is huge. But I can see that there is potential.Besides players from the main and reserve teams, we have shortlisted a few players from the trials. The team is good; the young boys are working hard. No matter what the team is (opponent), you will win if you play well. That is what I believe in. I have asked the boys not to worry about the opponents, whether they are from the ISL or I-League.It is difficult to implement a style of play when you have only a month to prepare. We began training at the start of the month and our first match is on July 31. But in general, I like it when the boys keep the ball in the front (attacking areas). I do not want the boys to keep the ball at the back for a long time. I do not want them to do that because it might create problems; errors at the back could lead to goals. I would rather expect the players to take the ball forward and play in the opponent’s half. That will be safer for us.Coyle is a wonderful coach; we can see it in his personality and coaching. Last season, he got Chennaiyin to the playoffs. It is always good to work with good coaches.

Following these events, Bev Priestman , the head coach of the Canadian team, announced her decision to abstain from participating in the team's opening match of their Olympics gold medal defence against New Zealand.This series of events unfolded after French authorities detained a staff member for piloting the drone over New Zealand's training, an act aimed at gathering intelligence on their tactical preparations.The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) has been informed of a second similar incident involving New Zealand, prompting an official complaint from the latter to the IOC integrity unit, seeking clarification and action from Canada.In response, the COC has engaged with both the IOC and FIFA.
