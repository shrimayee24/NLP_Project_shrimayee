qualification scenario

(Inputs from Agencies)

NEW DELHI: When Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) face off at the iconic Chinnaswamy Stadium, the stakes couldn't be higher. RCB, fueled by a string of victories, finds themselves on the cusp of a playoff berth , provided they can overcome CSK and meet specific run rate requirements.The absence of Will Jacks, who proved to be a dependable asset for RCB with his stellar batting performances, creates a void that the struggling Glenn Maxwell must fill.Maxwell's underwhelming season thus far contrasts sharply with the expectations pinned on him, but RCB fans remain hopeful that he can stage a comeback when it matters most.Virat Kohli 's approach to batting may undergo a subtle shift in Jacks' absence, with the captain Faf du Plessis possibly assuming a more aggressive stance at the crease, buoyed by the knowledge of solid support from the likes of Rajat Patidar and Dinesh Karthik in the batting line up.However, uncertainties loom over the match's fate, as a looming threat of rain threatens to disrupt proceedings. RCB fans, eager for their team's shot at playoff glory, anxiously hope for a weather miracle that spares the match from being washed out, or at least allows for a reduced-overs contest if rain intervenes.With the recent turn of events in the IPL 2024 league stage, Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) find themselves in a precarious yet hopeful position. Following Lucknow Super Giants' defeat to Delhi Capitals, RCB's pathway to the playoffs has crystallized into a specific set of requirements.To secure their coveted playoff spot, RCB must triumph over Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in their final league encounter. However, it's not just a matter of winning; the margin of victory holds the key. RCB's mission is clear: they must either win by a margin of 18 runs or chase down the target within 18.1 overs to eclipse CSK's Net Run Rate (NRR).This scenario adds a layer of intensity to the already high-stakes clash between RCB and CSK. Every run scored and every over bowled will be scrutinized with playoff aspirations hanging in the balance. For RCB, it's not just about winning; it's about winning with precision to tip the scales of NRR in their favor.As the league stage draws to a close, RCB's fate rests on their ability to execute their game plan with meticulous accuracy against a formidable CSK side. With playoff dreams within grasp, RCB must summon their best performance yet to clinch victory and secure their place in the IPL 2024 playoffs.CSK's hopes for a direct qualification to the playoffs in IPL 2024 hinge on their upcoming showdown with Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). If they emerge victorious, they'll secure a direct berth with 16 points. However, a loss to RCB could still keep their playoff dreams alive, but with a caveat.In the event of a loss, CSK must ensure that RCB doesn't meet specific run rate requirements. RCB would need to be restricted from chasing the target within 18.1 overs or winning by a margin of 18 runs or more. This adds an extra layer of pressure to CSK's performance, emphasizing the importance of strategic gameplay till the last ball.For CSK to clinch a coveted spot in the top two and secure a berth in the first qualifier, a series of dominoes must fall in their favour:1. Rajasthan Royals (RR) must falter in their final match against table-toppers Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR).2. CSK must triumph over RCB in their last league encounter.3. Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) must stumble in their last match, finishing with 15 points.Should these stars align, CSK's superior net run rate would elevate them to the second position on the points table with 16 points, setting the stage for a thrilling journey into the playoffs. With destiny hanging in the balance, CSK must navigate these intricacies with precision and determination to realize their aspirations for IPL 2024 glory.",Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) face off at the iconic Chinnaswamy Stadium.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians and Lucknow Super Giants , both out of contention for the IPL playoffs , will face off at the Wankhede Stadium. Lucknow's playoff hopes are nearly extinguished after three consecutive defeats that not only cost them crucial points but also hurt their net run rate. Mumbai Indians, with just four wins out of 13 matches, are facing a disappointing season, especially after the pre-season controversy surrounding their change in leadership from Rohit Sharma to Hardik Pandya.Pandya's captaincy has been under scrutiny, with fans expressing discontent. Mumbai's batting unit struggled collectively, relying heavily on Jasprit Bumrah 's exceptional bowling performances. However, his efforts couldn't rally the entire bowling lineup. (Here's a list of updated points table) Lucknow, despite KL Rahul 's impressive batting performance, failed to capitalize on key moments due to a lack of support from other batsmen. Nicholas Pooran provided some late sparks, but the team's overall batting performance was inconsistent. Additionally, their bowling unit couldn't deliver consistently, compounding their woes. With both teams seeking to salvage pride in their final match, the focus will be on ending the season on a positive note.In their head-to-head encounters , the Super Giants have been dominant, winning four out of five matches against the Mumbai Indians. However, facing off at the Wankhede Stadium brings its own dynamics into play.The pitch at the Wankhede has been a mixed bag, offering something for every player on the field. From high-scoring thrillers to instances of swing bowling mastery by players like Trent Boult, and the spinners making their mark, the stadium has witnessed a variety of cricketing spectacles. With the wicket showing signs of wear and tear after six games, it's expected to retain its batting-friendly nature initially but might slow down gradually, favoring the slower bowlers as the match progresses.Looking at the statistics from IPL 2024 at the Wankhede Stadium, both batting first and second have resulted in an equal number of victories. The average first innings total stands at 184, while teams batting second have chased down an average of 173 runs. The highest total recorded was an impressive 234/5 by the Mumbai Indians against the Delhi Capitals, while the lowest total stands at 125/9 by Mumbai Indians versus the Rajasthan Royals.Considering the fantasy implications of the pitch report, top-order batters from both teams are likely to flourish, especially when the ball is new and the pitch is at its best for batting. As the match progresses and the pitch slows down, spinners could come into play, making them valuable picks for fantasy contests . Additionally, fast bowlers adept at using variations like slowers and cutters could prove effective, particularly during the death overs, adding depth to fantasy team selections.He has been a standout performer for Mumbai Indians in IPL 2024, accumulating 416 runs in 13 matches. His consistency with the bat makes him a reliable pick for fantasy contests. (Here's a list of updated Orange cap list) He has been a key player for Mumbai Indians, showcasing his skill with 20 wickets in 13 matches. His ability to take wickets and maintain an economical bowling rate makes him a valuable asset for fantasy teams. (Here's a list of updated Purple cap list) The captain of Lucknow Super Giants, has amassed 465 runs in 13 matches. While he has been the leading run-scorer for his team, he has struggled to convert his starts into big scores in recent matches. However, his potential for a big innings makes him a worthy choice for fantasy contests.Hardik Pandya (c), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Dewald Brevis, Jasprit Bumrah, Piyush Chawla, Gerald Coetzee, Tim David, Shreyas Gopal, Ishan Kishan (wk), Anshul Kamboj, Kumar Kartikeya, Akash Madhwal, Kwena Maphaka, Mohammad Nabi, Shams Mulani, Naman Dhir, Shivalik Sharma, Romario Shepherd, Arjun Tendulkar, Nuwan Thushara, Tilak Varma, Harvik Desai (wk), Nehal Wadhera, Luke Wood.Quinton de Kock, KL Rahul (c & wk), Deepak Hooda, Ayush Badoni, Marcus Stoinis, Nicholas Pooran (wk), Krunal Pandya, Ravi Bishnoi, Mohsin Khan, Shamar Joseph, Yash Thakur, Manimaran Siddharth, Prerak Mankad, Arshad Khan, Krishnappa Gowtham, Amit Mishra, Kyle Mayers, Ashton Turner, Matt Henry, Naveen-ul-Haq, Devdutt Padikkal, Yudhvir Singh Charak, Mayank Yadav, Arshin Kulkarni.KL Rahul, Nicholas PooranRohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Nehal Wadhera, Tilak VarmaMarcus StoinisPiyush Chawla, Jasprit Bumrah, Naveen-ul-Haq, Arshad Khan","Mumbai Indians and Lucknow Super Giants will face off at the Wankhede Stadium.

IPL playoff scenarios

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad clinched their place in the IPL 2024 playoffs after their match against Gujarat Titans was abandoned without a ball bowled due to persistent rain at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Thursday. The washout resulted in both teams sharing a point each, propelling Hyderabad to third place on the points table with 15 points.Gujarat Titans, who had already been knocked out of the play-off race earlier in the week after their match against Kolkata Knight Riders was similarly abandoned due to rain, now find themselves out of contention entirely.With this outcome, the defending champions Chennai Super Kings , currently sitting in fourth place, and Royal Challengers Bengaluru are now leading the hunt for the final play-off spot. Both teams are gearing up for a crucial encounter that could determine their playoff fate.* KKR are already assured of sole top spot* If RR win their last game against KKR, they will be guaranteed sole second spot with 18 points. If they lose, they remain on 16 points, which means SRH can overtake them by winning against PBKS. They are sure to qualify, but need to win if they want the second spot* With 15 points, SRH have their fate in their hands. Win the last game and finish sole second or sole third with 17 points depending on the result of the KKR-RR game. If they lose the last game, RR will be ahead and CSK can get ahead by beating RCB. They will then finish fourth* CSK at 14 also have their fate in their hands. If they win against RCB, they finish on 16 points, and at worst fourth spot* RCB need to win against CSK to have a chance. That would take them to 14 points, level with CSK and DC behind KKR, RR and SRH. LSG too could tie at 14, but the good news for RCB is that they have a much better NRR than DC or LSG. Effectively, therefore, RCB need to close the NRR gap with CSK to beat them to the fourth spot. That’s not a tall ask. In a 200-run chase, they would need to win within 18.1 overs. If they bat first and score 200, they would need to restrict CSK to 182 or less.* DC are effectively out of it since KKR, RR and SRH are already ahead. If CSK win against RCB, they too will be ahead. If not, RCB will match DC’s 14 points with a superior NRR* LSG are not totally out of it, theoretically. If they beat MI and RCB beat CSK, they can tie for fourth spot on 14 points. But their NRR is so much worse than CSK’s and RCB’s that this is only a theoretical possibility* In short, KKR, RR and SRH are sure to qualify and one of CSK and RCB will join them in the last four (not necessarily the winner of the game between the two).","Sunrisers Hyderabad clinch their place in IPL 2024 playoffs after their match against Gujarat Titans was abandoned without a ball bowled due to persistent rain.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals (RR) suffered their fourth consecutive defeat as Punjab Kings (PBKS) secured a five-wicket victory in their IPL match on Wednesday. Despite this setback, RR, with 16 points, are assured of a playoff spot. However, their chances of finishing in the top two are slim due to an inferior net run rate, especially since Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) can still reach 18 points.In the match, Punjab Kings restricted RR to a modest 144 for nine.Riyan Parag, a local favorite, top-scored for RR with 48 off 34 balls on a challenging pitch. Punjab's bowlers were effective, with skipper Sam Curran taking 2 for 24 in 3 overs, Harshal Patel 2 for 28 in 4 overs, Nathan Ellis 1 for 24 in 4 overs, and Rahul Chahar 2 for 26 in 4 overs.In their chase, Curran led from the front with an unbeaten 63 off 41 balls, guiding PBKS to victory with seven balls to spare. Despite the win being inconsequential for Punjab, it was a morale-boosting performance for the team.In the IPL 2024 Orange Cap race, RCB's Virat Kohli tops the leaderboard with 661 runs in 13 innings. He is closely followed by CSK's skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad, who has accumulated 583 runs in 13 innings. SRH's Travis Head, thanks to his unbeaten 89, has moved up to third place with 533 runs. Riyan Parag's impressive performance against PBKS has elevated him to fourth place with 531 runs. B Sai Sudharsan's maiden IPL century has placed him fifth with 527 runs. Sanju Samson rounds out the top six, having scored 504 runs for Rajasthan Royals.In the pursuit of the coveted Purple Cap in IPL 2024, Harshal Patel has surged to the top with 22 wickets, overtaking Jasprit Bumrah who trails closely with 20 dismissals. Varun Chakravarthy's consistent performances have earned him third place with 18 wickets in 12 innings. Yuzvendra Chahal, the spin maestro of RR, has entered the Purple Cap race, securing fourth position with 17 wickets. Khaleel Ahmed of DC also holds 17 wickets, with Chahal edging ahead due to a superior economy rate. As the IPL 2024 season unfolds, bowlers are poised for an intense battle in the race for the Purple Cap.","The Orange Cap is the cap of the Indian national football team. The cap features the team's nickname, the “RUNS,” and the team’s nickname, “The RUNS’’. The team is made up of players from India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110171278,imgsize-42876,width-400,resizemode-4/110171278.jpg"

Tell me about your journey to becoming the youngest BCCI secretary even before you were 30 years of age.

Expressing optimism that the Indian men's cricket team will win the 2024 T20 World Cup after suffering a loss in the final of the ODI tournament last year, BCCI secretary Jay Shah said the squad has a good balance between form and experience.""The selectors can't choose on the basis of IPL performance alone, as overseas experience is also necessary,"" he said.In an exclusive interview, Jay Shah, secretary and key mover and shaker at BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) spoke to Harsh Vardhan Goenka, industrialist and cricket aficionado, at the board's headquarters at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.Shah said the biggest achievement of his tenure so far was holding the 2020 IPL in UAE in the midst of Covid-19. ""Olympics, EPL and French Open had already been postponed or cancelled... We demonstrated to the world what BCCI could achieve,"" he said.Asked about the criticism of IPL's impact player rule by several former and present cricketers, Shah replied, ""It's a test case. We are consulting players, franchisees and all concerned. I feel the matches are getting more interesting, more Indian players are getting a chance to play. If our consultations reveal dissatisfaction, we will change it.""On whether he thought IPL pitches have become too batting friendly, he said, ""I do not quite agree. If you look at the game between LSG and SRH, LSG scored 165/4 in 20 overs. On that pitch, SRH chased the target in around 9 overs without losing a wicket. Pitches are very good, created transparently and overseen by BCCI's central curator.""When I took over, my first decision was to strengthen the National Cricket Academy. We have invested more than Rs 250 crore to improve it and we hope to open the world class, new facility this July or August. My biggest achievement in my tenure was holding the 2020 IPL in UAE in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.The Olympics, English Premier League and French Open had already been postponed/cancelled. We created an isolation bubble within which we conducted the tournament. We demonstrated to the world what BCCI could achieve. We also changed the IPL broadcasting bidding process, separating the TV and digital feeds into separate bids netting us an extra Rs. 5,000 crore (out of a total Rs 48,390 crore). As BCCI's representative in ICC, I also helped boost our revenue due from ICC. As per the new revenue distribution model (2023-27), BCCI will be allocated a share of 38.5%. In the previous cycle, BCCI's revenue share stood at 22.4%.To me, one of your greatest achievements is your encouragement to women's cricket.When I decided to create WPL (Women's Premier League), I had a lot of convincing to do. One of the arguments I used was that 51% of IPL viewership was female. When we had the women's series against Australia in Navi Mumbai, we made the entrance free and we got a full house. I also insisted on pay parity because this would encourage women to come out and play. After my decision, I am glad to inform you that ICC also announced pay parity in prize money for the Women's World cup. We have also introduced a sports psychologist for the women's team and hired Amol Mazumdar as a dedicated coach for them.We did really well at the last ICC Men's World Cup 2023, but the final victory eluded us. I am optimistic that we will bring home the T20 World Cup trophy this year.It has a good balance between form and experience. The selectors cannot choose on the basis of IPL performance alone, as overseas experience is also necessary.India, Australia, New Zealand and the hosts, West Indies, because they are good in T20.As an administrator, I leave the cricketing decision to the experts. In BCCI, we have appointed VVS Laxman to look after NCA and Rahul Dravid as the Indian team coach. So, my job really is to choose the best and support them. I have full faith in them, and I know they are doing a fantastic job.Roger Binny is the cricketing brain. He is involved in each and every cricketing decision while I look after the administration and finance part. But finally, we do everything together. We have a very transparent and consultative process.Yes, talents like Yashaswi Jaiswal and Rinku Singh were test cases for BCCI. We empower state associations and give them guidelines to develop infrastructure, and we are searching for talent in all states. If they feel someone can do well for India, we recruit them to NCA. Right now, we have a pool of 50 players. So, if we need to play bilateral cricket with three different countries, we are in a position to do that. In NCA we train them to have all-round development, including helping them in personality development and wealth management.It's a test case. We are consulting players, franchisees and all concerned. I feel the matches are getting more interesting, more Indian players are getting a chance to play. If our consultations reveal dissatisfaction, we will change it.I don't quite agree. If you look at the game between LSG and SRH, LSG scored 165/4 in 20 overs. On that same pitch, SRH chased the target in around 9 overs without losing a wicket. Pitches are very good, created transparently and overseen by BCCI's central curator.This time we have introduced the 'smart' replay feature wherein the third umpire has access to all broadcast cameras operated by dedicated operators. The decision making for umpires and players' reviews have been much more time efficient due to this. This year we have also added a fast bowling insurance clause in the contract. So, if somebody gets injured, like Mayank Yadav, he will be compensated. We have a mega auction every third year. This will give an opportunity for players to get shuffled, providing different teams the opportunity to win the trophy. Another thing we have introduced is video graphing the entire process of bidding for new teams. It used to be a closed bid. Now all the bids are opened by the bidders themselves, providing complete transparency.A large proportion is pumped into state associations to improve their infrastructure and facilities. The major stream of revenues for BCCI is media rights and sponsorship of BCCI and IPL. In the case of IPL, the additional stream is franchise fee from IPL teams. From the revenues that BCCI generates, 70% is given to state associations for grassroots programmes, development of Infrastructure, conducting various tournaments across age groups, junior and senior levels to tap the talent across the length and breadth of the country. Then 26% of revenues are utilised for payment to players by way of retainership and match fees to men's international players, women's international players and domestic players. In case of IPL, the revenues are split 50:50 between BCCI and the 10 franchises, while 70% of franchise fee received by BCCI is also given to the associations.I love tennis and football. My favourite tennis player is Rafa Nadal who I believe is unbeatable on clay.Sunil Gavaskar of course, Sachin Tendulkar and MS Dhoni. From the current crop it's Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya as well.As BCCI secretary, I need to remain neutral, but I'm proud of all IPL teams for their unique style and contribution to the league's success.Of course, the Narendra Modi stadium in Ahmedabad. It is the largest sports stadium in the world with great facilities. I took the responsibility and had the entire stadium built in two-and-a-half years.Put the right people to oversee the game and at the same time maintain transparency in financial matters. I am also inspired by Swami Vivekanand - 'Arise, awake and stop not till the goal is achieved'.I am glad you asked that question as many people seem to assume that I somehow directly became BCCI secretary. I started my career as a member of the Central Board of Cricket, Ahmedabad in 2009. After that I was elected as an executive member of Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA), a post I held from 2009 to 2013. When I took over the GCA administration our team was in the Plate group of Ranji Trophy. During my tenure we went on to win our first Ranji Trophy. We also won the Vijay Hazare as well as the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy twice. At BCCI I became member of the marketing committee in 2013. Then I became member of the Finance Committee and since 2019 I am the secretary, which was also an election process amongst all members (state cricket associations).",BCCI secretary Jay Shah spoke to Harsh Vardhan Goenka at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.

Qualification scenarios for RCB

Qualification scenarios for CSK

Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) fans are hoping that rain clouds stay away from the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday when they host five-time champions Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in a must-win game in the race to IPL 2024 playoffs.Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) have sealed the top spot, while Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad have also confirmed themselves a top-four finish.Lucknow Super Giants' (LSG) hopes are only mathematically alive in their last match against Mumbai Indians, and the same goes for Delhi Capitals (DC). So it boils down to the RCB vs CSK match in Bengaluru on May 18 to decide the fourth playoff team. But the weather forecast for the match-day will keep RCB on tenterhooks.The match is scheduled to begin 7:30 pm, and the evening forecast for Saturday reads 'cloudy with a thunderstorm in parts of the area'. The forecast also shows '100% cloud cover' and '7.2 mm' of rain, with temperature after sunset to be in the early 20s.Seventh-place LSG's negative net run-rate (NRR) of -0.787 leaves them with little hope, even though they have similar number of points (12) as RCB. Delhi have 14 points, but having finished their league engagements with a negative NRR of -0.377 to go with their 14 points, they too are hoping against hope.The Bengaluru team's positive NRR of +0.387 makes them better placed. However, CSK, who have 14 points, enjoy the best NRR among the four, which reads +0.528. Because of that, RCB will have their calculators out to know the margins of victory they would need to leapfrog CSK.In case RCB bat first and set CSK a target of 200 to win, then Faf du Plessis's team will have to win by a minimum of 18 runs to go past CSK's net run-rate and sneak into the playoffs.If RCB chase a target of 201 or more, then they will have to win by a minimum of 11 balls to spare.The simple math for CSK is to win and go through. However, because the five-time champions have two points more than RCB's 12, even a narrow defeat can take them through, provided their net run-rate remains superior compared to RCB's.In case of a washout or no-result, the teams will get one point each, which will be enough for CSK to go through.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) host Chennai Super Kings (CSK) on May 18.

Gautam Gambhir approached by BCCI for Team India's head coach post: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/gautam-gambhir-approached-by-bcci-for-team-indias-head-coach-post-report/articleshow/110214490.cms,"(With IANS inputs)

NEW DELHI: Gautam Gambhir , the former India left-handed opener, has reportedly been approached by the BCCI to potentially become the next head coach of the India senior men’s team. This comes as the BCCI officially opened applications for the India men’s head coach’s position, with a deadline set for May 27.The role of the new India men’s head coach would encompass all three formats from July 2024 until December 2027.Rahul Dravid 's tenure as India’s head coach commenced after the 2021 Men’s T20 World Cup and concluded with the 2023 Men’s ODI World Cup, with an extension granted until the conclusion of this year’s Men’s T20 World Cup.According to a report by ESPNCricinfo, Gambhir, who currently mentors the Kolkata Knight Riders , is said to be at the forefront of the BCCI's wishlist to assume the coaching role after Dravid's term concludes at the end of the 2024 Men’s T20 World Cup, scheduled to take place in the West Indies and the USA from June 1-29.The report further said Gambhir has been contacted by the BCCI to seek his interest in the top job, and further discussions are expected after KKR complete their IPL 2024 campaign.“However, the deadline for applying for the India head coach job is May 27, a day after the IPL final. Dravid, it is learnt, has communicated to the BCCI his decision not to seek another tenure,” it added.Gambhir, aged 42, lacks prior experience as a head coach at either the international or domestic level, but has served in a mentorship role within the IPL. He acted as the mentor for the Lucknow Super Giants franchise during IPL 2022 and 2023, guiding them to playoff qualifications in both seasons.Transitioning to the IPL 2024 season, Gambhir took on a similar mentorship role with the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), where the Shreyas Iyer-led team is poised to finish the league stage atop the points table and compete in Qualifier 1 in Ahmedabad.As a player, the left-handed opener was a pivotal member of India's triumphs in the Men’s T20 World Cup in 2007 and the 2011 Men’s ODI World Cup.Additionally, Gambhir captained KKR to victory in two IPL seasons, 2012 and 2014, along with a runners-up finish in the now-defunct Champions League T20 in 2014. His successful track record as both a player and mentor within the cricketing arena adds weight to his potential candidacy for the role of India's head coach.IANS had previously reported that Gambhir, along with Stephen Fleming, Ashish Nehra, Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer are amongst the big names in fray for the India senior men’s head coach job.There was the name of VVS Laxman , the former India batter, doing the rounds too for the top job, but he was unlikely to enter the race due to him currently being the head of the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru.","Gautam Gambhir has reportedly been approached by the BCCI to potentially become the next head coach of the India senior men’s team.

KL Rahul: 'Will be cheering for 'Sharma ji ka beta'...': KL Rahul signs off from IPL 2024 with a cheeky remark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/will-be-cheering-for-sharma-ji-ka-beta-kl-rahul-signs-off-from-ipl-2024-with-a-cheeky-remark/articleshow/110221403.cms,"(With inputs from ANI)

NEW DELHI: After the victory against Mumbai Indians in their final fixture of the Indian Premier League 2024, Lucknow Super Giants skipper KL Rahul expressed his disappointment with the team's overall performance in the 17th edition of the cash-rich league.Despite the win, LSG ended their season with 14 points from 14 games and were eliminated from the playoffs race.At the post-match interaction, Rahul managed to lighten the mood with a humorous reference to a popular advertisement featuring himself, his father-in-law Suniel Shetty , and Indian cricket captain Rohit Sharma .""I'm on my father-in-law's team now. We'll both be cheering for Sharma ji ka beta in the World Cup,"" he quipped, indicating his support for the Rohit-led Indian team in the upcoming T20 World Cup .Reflecting on the season, Rahul stated, ""Very disappointing. At the beginning of the season, I really felt we had a strong team and had most bases covered. A couple of injuries - happen to every team. We didn't play well enough collectively. Today was a really good performance. This is the kind of game we wanted to play more. Unfortunately, we didn't do that.""Rahul praised the hard work and development of LSG's Indian pacers, noting the franchise's significant investment in their training.""Really happy for them. The franchise has invested a lot of time and energy with them. It's not just two months in the year. We sent Mayank and Yudhvir to South Africa to train with Morne Morkel. Hard work for them has paid off, but the franchise and the team have worked a lot with them,"" he said.The 32-year-old also shared insights on his personal journey and future goals.""There's not much T20 cricket coming up now. It's been a season where I've learnt a lot about my own batting and what I need to do to get back in the team. Maybe middle-order, maybe not. We would've ideally wanted him (Pooran) to bat higher, but with how the team's lined up, we want our senior international players to bat in positions where they can absorb pressure. Didn't want our two overseas batters to bat close together,"" Rahul explained.While the season didn't end as hoped for LSG, Rahul's comments highlight both the challenges faced and the valuable lessons learned, as he looks forward to future opportunities in his cricketing career.","Lucknow Super Giants skipper KL Rahul expressed his disappointment with the team's overall performance in the 17th edition of the cash-rich league.

MS Dhoni: 'Fans chahte hai aap jyada waqt bitaye pitch me...': Pathan advocates for Dhoni's higher batting position in crucial CSK vs RCB clash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/fans-chahte-hai-aap-jyada-waqt-bitaye-pitch-me-pathan-advocates-for-dhonis-higher-batting-position-in-crucial-csk-vs-rcb-clash/articleshow/110221609.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has voiced his support for seeing Mahendra Singh Dhoni bat higher up the order for Chennai Super Kings in their pivotal final league match against Royal Challengers Bengaluru on Saturday.Pathan believes that Dhoni's current hitting form and the high-scoring nature of the Bengaluru ground make a compelling case for this change.Speaking on Star Sports, Pathan acknowledged the reasons behind Dhoni batting primarily in the final few overs but expressed his hope that Dhoni would entertain his vast fan base by spending more time on the pitch with the bat.""Mahendra Singh Dhoni's batting is not the same as it used to be during his peak, when he was 32-33 years old. Here there is a knee issue; he has been playing for so long and faced many problems along the way. He knows that in the last 2-3 years he hasn't played big innings. He used to come to bat during the 12th-13th over, but he is not now. He has accepted and we should accept it too. But we can only hope,"" Pathan said. ""He is not coming higher up the order to preserve his knee. Still, I want him to bat more with the form he is in.""Highlighting Dhoni's impressive form this season, Pathan added, ""He was not in form the last two seasons. But this year, his hitting form is brilliant. He is striking fast bowlers for sixes over the covers. He has excellent reach this time, and it comes with good fitness and when the knees are in good shape. He is hitting with one hand too and he has always showcased power with his backlift. He is even hitting low full tosses. He won't get a better pitch than Bengaluru. There's no turn and the ground is not big. And the bowling of RCB is also not up to the mark.""Despite Dhoni not being the official captain, Pathan emphasized his leadership role within the team. ""Even though he is not officially captain of the side, still he is one of the leaders of the team. So taking all the situations into account, he should take the responsibility and come to bat up the order,"" Pathan noted.Pathan also highlighted Dhoni's running between the wickets, saying, ""It is not that he is not running for runs. He is running and when two can be scored he runs with the same intensity and looks good. Then why not? You had said that you are playing for the fans, then fans want to see you spend more time on the pitch with the bat [Aapne kaha na ki aap fans ke liye khel rahe hai, woh chahte hai aap jyada waqt bitaye pitch me balle ke saath],"" Pathan concluded.The upcoming clash between RCB and CSK is a high-stakes encounter that will determine the final team to qualify for the IPL playoffs. Thursday's washout in Hyderabad confirmed Sunrisers Hyderabad, Kolkata Knight Riders, and Rajasthan Royals as playoff contenders, leaving one spot open for either CSK or RCB.CSK, with 13 points and a net run-rate of 0.528, are favorites due to their superior standings and historical performance at the venue, having lost only once in eight matches against the home side. RCB, with 12 points and a net run-rate of 0.387, face a tougher challenge and must win decisively to secure their playoff spot.Adding to the drama is the forecast of rain, which could result in a washout favoring CSK's playoff chances. RCB will need to win by at least 18 runs or chase their target with about 11 balls to spare to advance, intensifying the pressure on the in-form team that has staged a remarkable comeback with five consecutive wins after a six-match losing streak.",Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has voiced his support for Mahendra Singh Dhoni to bat higher up the order for Chennai Super Kings.

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma delivered his best performance of the season in a valiant effort, scoring a blistering 68 off 38 balls, but it wasn't enough to prevent Mumbai Indians (MI) from ending their IPL 2024 campaign on a low note.MI suffered an 18-run defeat to Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) at home, finishing at 196 for six in pursuit of 215, ultimately placing last in the league for the second time in three years.Despite Rohit's early fireworks, MI's middle-order faltered, losing momentum and failing to capitalize on the strong platform set by their captain. Young talent Naman Dhir showcased his potential with a late half-century, but his effort came too late to change the game's outcome.For LSG, Nicholas Pooran 's explosive 75 off 29 balls, coupled with KL Rahul 's measured 55, propelled them to a formidable total of 214 for 6. This victory moved LSG to the sixth spot in the standings, although their net run rate remained marginally negative at -0.667.The match potentially marked the end of Rohit Sharma's 14-year journey with MI, as rumors swirl about his future with the franchise following Hardik Pandya's controversial appointment as captain. Despite enduring a challenging season, Rohit ended as MI's third-highest run-scorer.Hardik Pandya's captaincy faced significant backlash from fans, who frequently booed him and showed unwavering support for Rohit, their long-time leader.Even during Rohit's outstanding innings, the crowd's ovation quickly turned to hooting when Hardik took the field, underscoring the fans' discontent with the leadership change.Earlier in the game, Pooran's quick-fire innings rescued LSG from a sluggish start. Struggling at 69 for 3 at the halfway mark, his aggressive batting helped LSG recover and post a competitive total, ultimately securing a crucial win.","Rohit Sharma scores 68 as Mumbai Indians finish last in IPL 2024.

The fact that MS Dhoni gave him that little extra momentum is why he is the Kohli we see today,"" Gavaskar said on Star Sports.Both Gavaskar and Kohli were involved in a war of words when the former batter criticized him for his slow strike-rate in the IPL.""If you have a strike rate of 118, you come and face the first ball, and then you get out in the 14th or 15th over and your strike rate is 118 – if you want applause for that, then that's a little bit different,"" Gavaskar had said.Kohli also hit back at the criticism saying: ""Not really, all the people who talk about strike-rates and me not playing spin well are the ones talking about this stuff. For me, it's about winning the games for the team and there's a reason why you've done it for 15 years, you've done this day in and day out, you've won games for your teams, I'm not quite sure that if you haven't been in that situation yourself, to sit and talk about the game in the box. For me, people can talk about their assumptions day in and day out, but those who have done day in and day out, they know what's happening and it's a kind of muscle memory for me now"".Gavaskar believed that such comments were a direct insult to the knowledge of former cricketers who are working as experts.""All these guys talk about, 'oh we don't care about outside noise'. Accha! Then why are you replying to any outside noise or whatever it is. We all played a bit of cricket, not a lot of cricket. We don't have agendas. We speak about what we see.

(With PTI inputs)

Usain Bolt is intimately familiar with life in the fast lane, so it's no wonder he's chosen T20 as his favourite cricket format. This sport runs in his blood, thanks to his father's passionate influence.Bolt, renowned as one of the greatest athletes in history with eight Olympic gold medals, harbored aspirations of becoming a fast bowler during his upbringing in Jamaica.Now, as the ambassador for the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup , he's fulfilling his cricketing dreams.""I grew up on cricket. My dad was a massive cricket fan and still is. It is something that I have always in my blood. To actually get to be a part of cricket again as an ambassador, it is wonderful. I never got to live my dream of being a cricketer so to be ambassador of T20 World Cup is wonderful,"" Bolt said while talking to PTI over the phone from New York.In 2017, the world record holder in the prestigious 100m and 200m events, concluded his extraordinary career. Seven years later, his charisma still stands unparalleled.As he made his way towards the makeshift cricket stadium in New York, one of the three T20 World Cup venues on the American mainland and the site for the India-Pakistan clash on June 9, a child-like excitement radiated from him while discussing cricket.His recent months have been filled with global travels for music, football and various other endeavors, leaving him little time to catch live cricket on television, including the ongoing IPL.""I have not been able to watch as much as I would like to but when I get time, I try to catch up on T20s,"" said the 'Lightning Bolt'.Bolt remains exhilarated by speed, which is why he deems T20 as the ultimate format of the game.""T20s for sure... When they started, it was a great idea and still is. It compresses the game because you have to be strong and quick but also be strategic, set a field and get things done quick. To me it combines Test match and one-day together to create the perfect game.""Bolt isn't alone in the Caribbean in being drawn to the shortest format. Elite cricketers from the region are increasingly celebrated for their performances in T20 leagues rather than their contributions to the West Indian team.With the surge in popularity of T20 cricket, Test cricket is under serious threat in the region. Bolt concurs that the future favors the slam-bang format.""I think the T20s and one dayers (ODIs) are still massive in the Caribbean. People actually don't enjoy Test cricket that much. It is all about the speed of the game, big hitters like Andre Russell, so for me that is the direction that is going in (game is going in the Caribbean).""It will bring more people to watch the sport. Because people love excitement. That is the key,"" he said.For the first time, the USA is hosting a global cricket event. Although the sport is currently dominated by South Asian and Caribbean expats, Bolt holds the belief that the local American community will gradually embrace and engage with cricket.""I surely think the game can grow in USA. When you have presence in a country people start gravitating towards it and want to know more about.""Despite his limited free time, Bolt reminisces about watching plenty of cricket while growing up in Jamaica, often alongside his father. He vividly recalls the sight of Wasim Akram dismissing batters with his in-swinging yorkers, a memory that remains etched in his mind.""Over the years, one of my favourites growing up was Wasim Akram because of the in-swinging yorker that he had. Of course, Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose, all these guys that I admired over the years, they were so dominant in their space.""Was there anyone in the Indian team he particularly admired?""Like my father, I always support the West Indies (laughs). But yes, I have also been a Sachin Tendulkar fan. He and Brian Lara were part of my life growing up. It was a great rivalry,"" he said referring to the two legendary batters.Among the current lot, Bolt says ""Kohli is the standout one for sure"".When questioned about the possibility of a cricketer having even a hint of potential as a sprinter, Bolt's showmanship shone through.""We have a running joke right now, me and Chris Gayle; he said actually he can beat me over 100 metres. We are looking to put out a race and see what happens (laughs).""When it comes to speed, I am the best. I don't think there is any cricketer right now that can challenge me (laughs),"" said Bolt.","Usain Bolt is the ambassador for the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup.

At the start of the season, I felt we had a very strong season and most bases were covered. Couple of injuries happen to every season and team but the guys who went away dented us a little bit.

It depends on where I stand and what I need to do to get back in the team, I'll think about what the team needs. (Was Pooran batting too low down the order?) Not really, we'd have ideally wanted him to bat higher but how the teams line up is how the international players slot to absorb the pressure.

NEW DELHI: England Test captain Ben Stokes made a notable return to the County Championship with Durham , marking his first appearance in two years by taking two wickets on Friday.Stokes, who is aiming to re-establish himself as a genuine all-rounder for England following knee surgery, dismissed Josh Bohannon and New Zealand's Tom Bruce in a First Division match against Lancashire at Blackpool.Stokes, 32, ended the opening day with encouraging figures of 2-70 from 17 overs, a positive sign after spending much of last year playing primarily as a specialist batsman.However, the day belonged to his former Durham teammate Keaton Jennings , who scored 115 runs, including 17 fours, leading Lancashire to a total of 350-9.Stokes has ruled himself out of England's T20 World Cup title defense in the United States and the Caribbean next month to ensure he can be a fully-fledged all-rounder in Test cricket.England is set to play six Tests in their 2024 home season, three against the West Indies and three against Sri Lanka, with the first Test against the West Indies at Lord's starting on July 10, just under two weeks after the T20 World Cup final on June 29 in Barbados.",England Test captain Ben Stokes returns to County Championship with Durham.

NEW DELHI: A dejected Hardik Pandya acknowledged that the poor quality of cricket played by Mumbai Indians (MI) was the primary reason for their disappointing 2024 IPL season, which ended with a second last-place finish in three years.The five-time champions also finished last in 2022.Pandya's return to the MI setup was met with much fanfare, but the team managed to win only four out of 14 games under his leadership.Reflecting on the season, Pandya admitted that their performance fell significantly short of expectations, ultimately costing them the chance to make a meaningful impact in the tournament.""It was quite difficult. We did not play good quality cricket, eventually cost us the whole season,"" Pandya said after MI's 18-run loss to Lucknow Super Giants in Mumbai.""It's a professional world. Have to always come out and put our best foot forward. But yes, as a group we could not play quality cricket or smart cricket.""As the dust settles down, he would probably dissect what went wrong.""Too early to point out what went wrong. The whole season kind of went wrong. We can pass this game as another one (that went wrong).""LSG skipper KL Rahul , whose team also finished out of play-off zone was equally disappointed.""Very disappointing. At the start of the season, I felt we had a very strong season and most bases covered. Couple of injuries happen but the guys who went away dented us a little bit,"" Rahul said with obvious reference to country's fastest bowler Mayank Yadav.""We didn't play well enough collectively and couldn't come together as much as we wanted to. Today was the kind of game we wanted to play more when the bowlers and batters both come together,"" he said.Rahul, who is not part of the Indian team for the upcoming T20 World Cup , however, was non-committal on whether he would bat in the middle order in coming days.""Maybe, maybe not, there's not much T20 cricket coming up [for me] now,"" he said when asked if he will think of batting in the middle order.""It depends on where I stand and what I need to do to get back in the team, I'll think about what the team needs,"" he added.","Hardik Pandya says poor quality of cricket cost Mumbai Indians IPL season.

This could be Rohit Sharma's last game for Mumbai Indians: Shane Watson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/this-could-be-rohit-sharmas-last-game-for-mumbai-indians-shane-watson/articleshow/110216850.cms,"(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Former Australia cricketer Shane Watson has suggested that the match against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 might be Rohit Sharma 's final game for Mumbai Indians (MI).This speculation follows the appointment of Hardik Pandya as MI's new skipper, which has fueled rumors about Rohit's future with the franchise.Rohit, 37, has been a stalwart for Mumbai Indians, but there are indications that IPL 2024 could be his last season with the team.In this season, Rohit has scored 349 runs at an impressive strike rate of 145.42 across 13 matches. His contributions have been significant, but the leadership change has led to increased speculation about his tenure with MI.As fans and analysts await further developments, the match against LSG will be watched closely, potentially marking the end of an era for Rohit with Mumbai Indians.Speaking at Jio Cinema, Watson said the former MI skipper has been a great leader for Mumbai.""This could be Rohit Sharma's last game for Mumbai Indians. You never know how exactly things will play out after this season but what an incredible player he has been and a leader for the Mumbai Indians. To have so much success with the franchise and him being so entrenched in the Mumbai Indians family,"" Watson said.Watson felt the decision to remove Rohit from the captaincy was a ""wrong call"" since he is a well-respected leader.""But for me personally, I think that was the wrong call. Because he is such a well-respected leader. It just shook-up the team, knowing that they could move on next season potentially and have Hardik Pandya as captain. This could be his swansong for the Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium . So, I am sure that he is going to go out on a great note,"" he added.Last year, MI announced that all-rounder Hardik Pandya, who returned to the Mumbai franchise after guiding the Gujarat Titans (GT) to the IPL title in its debut season and the final in the subsequent edition, will lead the franchise in the 2024 edition of the league. Which meant removing Rohit as the skipper, who had led the franchise to five titles since starting his reign in 2013.In November last year, Pandya moved back from Gujarat Titans (GT) to his former franchise as part of a trade between both franchises. The star all-rounder spent two momentous years with GT, spearheading their campaign in the cash-rich league with aplomb. In GT's debut season in 2022, Hardik got them off to a fairytale start, with the team lifting the coveted trophy.The Mumbai-based franchise stands at the bottom of the IPL 2024 standings with eight points. Hardik Pandya's side displayed a sloppy performance in the 17th season of the tournament and won just four games after playing 13 matches.","Former Australia cricketer Shane Watson has suggested that the match against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 might be Rohit Sharma's final game for Mumbai Indians.

NEW DELHI: Nicholas Pooran 's whirlwind 75 compensated for skipper KL Rahul 's steady 55, providing the much-needed impetus for the Lucknow Super Giants to reach an impressive total of 214 for 6 against the Mumbai Indians in an IPL match in Mumbai on Friday.Struggling for momentum on what appeared to be a two-paced wicket at the start, LSG managed only 69 for 3 at the halfway stage. However, Pooran's stunning knock made up for another lackluster Powerplay effort by Rahul, who struggled to adapt his game during the early overs.Mumbai Indians' bowling woes persisted, with skipper Hardik Pandya employing eight different bowling options.Despite this, only seasoned Piyush Chawla (3/29) and newcomer Nuwan Thushara (3/28) managed to make an impact.Pooran's innings was a treat to watch for the spectators, especially for the visiting Trinidad & Tobago's Prime Minister Dr. Keith Rowley, who must have been delighted to see his countryman dominate the opposition bowlers with such ease.His lofted hits to clear the covers as well as powerful pulls on the leg side were equally compelling until Pooran found Suryakumar Yadav grabbing the ball out of thin air at long on in the 17th over.By then, the free-flowing West Indian had already notched up his highest score of the season, hammering eight sixes and five fours for 75 off a mere 29 balls.Pooran's dismissal followed Rahul's exit after their 44-ball stand for 109 runs for the fourth wicket, which gave LSG the platform to push for a total exceeding 200.Pooran's onslaught also debunked the slowness of the pitch - if there was any as made evident by LSG's top order - and Rahul's solidity in tough phases ensured that the visitors did not stumble at any stage in their innings.The LSG skipper did well to not rush into imposing himself on the game despite his side not able to find their feet for a large part of their innings.Rahul forged two crucial partnerships, including 48 runs for second wicket with Marcus Stoinis, and put on 55 off 41 balls with three fours and as many sixes.Ayush Badoni also chipped in with a 10-ball 22, collecting 19 runs off Romario Shepherd in the last over.LSG were off to a rocky start with Devdutt Padikkal dismissed for a first-ball duck. Nuwan Thushara (3/28) swung the ball back into the left-hander who was pinned in front of the wickets and burned a review.But there was no such mistake committed by Stoinis, trapped leg-before at the end of the powerplay by Chawla after the Australian stroked his way to 28 off 22 balls with five fours.Stoinis also used the DRS to perfection when the on-field umpire obliged a passionate appeal for leg-before by Arjun Tendulkar, with the replays confirming that the ball would have passed over the stumps. Tendulkar however was clobbered mercilessly by Pooran and after being hit for back-to-back sixes, the young left-arm seamer was forced to leave the field as he suddenly started suffering from cramps.",Lucknow Super Giants reach 214-6 in IPL match against Mumbai Indians.

NEW DELHI: Dwayne Bravo , the bowling coach of Chennai Super Kings (CSK), has crafted meticulous bowling plans aimed at thwarting Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in their crucial final league encounter, where the victor claims all. With confidence in his strategies, Bravo issued a challenge to Virat Kohli's team, suggesting they prepare for the next season if they fail to counter CSK's tactics.Bravo, renowned for his effectiveness as a death bowler in T20 cricket, played a pivotal role in four of CSK's five trophy victories.Leveraging his expertise, he is actively involved in coaching CSK's bowlers, such as Tushar Deshpande and Simarjeet Singh , ensuring they execute his plans with precision. As CSK gear up for the showdown against RCB, Bravo's strategic guidance could prove decisive in securing a crucial victory.""You should respect the opposition and RCB rightly so, we respect them. We prepare well as a bowling group, we have very good plans. RCB will have to try to beat us off our plans. And if they do that, well played to them. But if they don't, then... next season for them,"" the cocky Bravo said at pre-match press conference.Bravo expresses satisfaction with the performance of the bowling unit despite the absence of senior pro Deepak Chahar for a significant portion of the season. Despite the challenge of missing a key player, the bowling group has stepped up admirably, showcasing resilience and adaptability.""I don't want to give our plans away but at the same time, I think last season and this season have been very good with a fairly youngish bowling group.""Death bowling in T20 cricket is very important and most times it defines the result and outcome of the game.""The inclement weather in Bengaluru could well lead to a washout and, in that case, CSK (15 points in 14 games) will pip RCB (13 in 14 games) to ensure a top-four spot, although they would have to play the Eliminator in Ahmedabad.""We don't have control over the weather. We don't try to bring up things that we don't have control over. It's another game for us to push for a playoff spot and we're really looking ahead to the challenge against a very good team,"" Bravo said.","Dwayne Bravo is the bowling coach of Chennai Super Kings (CSK) He has crafted meticulous bowling plans aimed at thwarting Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) Bravo issued a challenge to RCB, suggesting they prepare for the next season if they fail to counter CSK's tactics.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110215472,imgsize-57730,width-400,resizemode-4/110215472.jpg"

NEW DELHI: As Sunil Chhetri pondered how to announce his retirement to the world, he knew there was one man who would truly understand his emotions. Virat Kohli , as expected, provided the support the iconic Indian football captain needed.The 39-year-old Chhetri, the most capped Indian footballer with 150 matches and the country's top scorer with 94 goals, has decided to retire after the World Cup qualifying match against Kuwait on June 6 in Kolkata.Chhetri made the announcement on Thursday, driven by what he described as inexplicable instincts.

Sunil Chhetri: Little guy sparked big interest at Mohun Bagan trials,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/sunil-chhetri-little-guy-sparked-big-interest-at-mohun-bagan-trials/articleshow/110195578.cms,"KOLKATA: With a lifetime of memories, Subrata Bhattacharya slipped into nostalgia on Thursday. ""In those days, it was common for Kolkata's big clubs to hold trials for aspiring footballers regularly in a move to catch them young. As the head coach of Mohun Bagan 's senior football team, I was privileged to oversee such trials and recommend who would be offered a contract.""There was a diminutive guy playing as a striker in one such trial match and he caught me by surprise when he scored from a bicycle kick. The goal was straight from the page of Shyam Thapa's skill-book. 'Sign him,' I told the club management after seeing that goal,"" the former Mohun Bagan defender and coach recalled.A week later, he was signed on a three-year contract with Mohun Bagan.And this was how Sunil Chhetri 's career as a professional footballer took wing in 2002 on the famed Maidan at the age of 17 years.""He was diminutive, but his spot-jump was excellent, allowing him to beat a defender in the air and score many goals during his time at Mohun Bagan under my coaching,"" Bhattacharya pointed out.After India's World Cup qualifier against Kuwait in Kolkata this June, Chhetri in the India jersey would also be the past.Little did Bhattacharya realize during that pre-season trial in 2002 how the diminutive dynamo would explode in theIndian football landscape in the next couple of decades. Little did the Bagan coach realize that he would one day welcome him as son-in-law.After courting Bhattacharya's daughter Sonam for many years, Chhetri tied the knot with her on Dec 4 in 2017.Although he had represented India in the Asian School Championship in 2001, Chhetri 's main objective was to get admission in Delhi's St Stephen's College through sports quota. But that contract with Mohun Bagan changed his life completely.""I never realized that he would grow into such a legend. As a player, I've got to put Sunil in the class of Chunni Goswami, Balaram and Parimal Dey. His dedication, discipline and hunger should always be an example for the future generation,"" Bhattacharya maintained.And as a son-in-law? Bhattacharya smiled. ""We don't usually talk about football at home. Sunil has taken his game to such a height that I've hardly anything to suggest to him. But I want him to remain involved in the game. It's his call to take,"" the 72-year-old said.",Subrata Bhattacharya was the head coach of Mohun Bagan's senior football team. Chhetri was signed on a three-year contract with the Kolkata club in 2002 at the age of 17. The former Bagan defender says he never realized that he would grow into such a legend.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110195543,imgsize-54336,width-400,resizemode-4/110195543.jpg"
"One final time: Nineteen years, 150 games, 94 goals later, Sunil Chhetri says Kuwait tie in June will be his last for India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/one-final-time-nineteen-years-150-games-94-goals-later-sunil-chhetri-says-kuwait-tie-in-june-will-be-his-last-for-india/articleshow/110195344.cms,"PANAJI: Sunil Chhetri remembers the morning he was told by coach Sukhwinder Singh that he would make his senior debut for India. It was Sunday, June 12, 2005 in Quetta, Pakistan. Chhetri had played in Pakistan before; just over a year ago he had played for India's Under-23 side in the Islamabad SAF Games, but this was something else altogether.The 21-year-old striker couldn't hide his joy.""It was unbelievable,"" Chhetri recalled on Thursday, almost two decades after that national team debut in 2005. ""I can't tell you how I was feeling. I took my jersey and sprayed some perfume on it. Everything that happened that day once coach told me, from breakfast to lunch, I'll never forget. It's one of my best days on my national team journey.""That journey which started with a goal in front of 20,000 partisan Pakistanis, is special, and one that no footballer has experienced before. It's been 19 years, 150 matches and 94 goals, the scale of his achievements impossible to compute. In a country where cricket is religion, Chhetri won fans and wooed crowds with his dare and discipline.Now, he has decided to call time on his phenomenal international career. The game against Kuwait in Kolkata on June 6, a crucial one where India need a win to make it to the third round of theFIFA World Cup qualifiers for the first time, will be his last.Chhetri's decision, announced on Thursday morning, didn't really raise eyebrows.For some time now, there were calls for him to make way for younger strikers. The goals were drying up too; his last field goal was against Malaysia in October last year and he went six games without scoring, including three in the high-profile AFC Asian Cup 2023.""When the instinct came that this should be my last game, and I thought about it a lot, eventually I came to this decision. Will I be sad, of course. It took time (for this decision) because the kid inside me, he never wants to stop, if given a chance, to play for this country. Never,"" said Chhetri.Chhetri, 39, will end his international career as the most capped player, and the highest Indian international goal scorer, his tally only behind global superstars Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in the active players' list.Some of his goals have been jaw dropping: the great run against Kyrgyz Republic from just outside India's own danger zone, the imperious chip over Kenya goalkeeper, the strike to break the Myanmar jinx; the set-piece goal against Oman. And who can forget all the penalties where he was guaranteed to score and lift India's mood.""I am fortunate. So many amazing things have happened, I've practically lived a dream, but nothing comes close to playing for the country. The kid kept fighting and probably in the future will keep fighting inside. But the mature person inside, knows this is it. It wasn't easy.""I think it's time for the country to see the next number nine (forward). It's time we build on it. Already we are a little bit handicapped because a lot of national team boys don't play number nines at their clubs (who prefer foreigners). At least now, when I am not there, I am sure so many will step up and they need time,"" said Chhetri.The next game for India, Chhetri's final one, is among the most crucial.Win against Kuwait and the team makes it to the third round of the World Cup qualifiers for the first time. There's immense pressure on coach Igor Stimac - lose and he's out - besides the players. But the face of Indian football remains calm.""I don't feel the pressure at a time when this game demands pressure,"" said Chhetri.""We need the three points against Kuwait to qualify for the next round. It's hugely important for us. But in a strange and nice way, I don't feel the pressure. I know these 15-20 days of training and the Kuwait game is my last. I am quite certain that I will enjoy.""Fans will have big expectations of Chhetri when he takes the field for India, one final time. A goal against Kuwait and fans will start singing, 'We've got Chhetri, Sunil Chhetri... I just don't think you understand. Oh! when he scores, we go f***ing mad... We've got Sunil Chhetri.'
