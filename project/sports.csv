Cardi B’s pregnancy adds to the spotlight on Diggs’ personal life



New England Patriots star Stefon Diggs is juggling major life changes as a paternity lawsuit collides with his high-profile relationship with Cardi B . While an Instagram model claims he fathered her child, Cardi recently announced she is expecting his baby, putting Diggs in a delicate personal and legal spotlight.New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs is at the center of a personal storm that blends the worlds of football, music, and family life. Court filings reveal that an Instagram model, Lord Gisselle, also known as GiGi, claims Diggs fathered her daughter, born in April 2025. The lawsuit, initiated while GiGi was pregnant, seeks custody rights and child support, marking a complex legal challenge for the star receiver.Diggs has responded by requesting genetic testing to confirm paternity. According to reports, he has stated that if the results prove he is the father, he intends to pursue joint legal and physical custody. He has also expressed willingness to share costs related to pregnancy and legal fees, signaling that he does not intend to shy away from responsibility.The timing of the lawsuit makes the situation even more delicate.Cardi B, who confirmed her pregnancy with Diggs during a CBS Mornings interview, described her excitement, saying, “I am actually very, I am excited.” Their relationship, which became public at the 2025 Met Gala after months of speculation, is now under added scrutiny as the legal case unfolds.This is not the first time Diggs has been in the spotlight for personal matters—he already has an eight-year-old daughter from a previous relationship.

Brock Purdy’s progress offers hope but raises questions about timing

Mac Jones and team depth show resilience in Brock Purdy’s absence

The San Francisco 49ers are off to a perfect 2-0 start in the 2025 NFL season, but their early momentum has been clouded by injury concerns to some of their biggest stars. Quarterback Brock Purdy and tight end George Kittle headline a growing list of key players dealing with setbacks, leaving head coach Kyle Shanahan to strike a delicate balance between caution and competitiveness.Brock Purdy, who has been central to the 49ers’ resurgence since 2022, sat out last week’s win against the New Orleans Saints with a turf toe and shoulder issue. “He returned to practice on a limited basis,” Shanahan confirmed, signaling optimism that Purdy could be available for Sunday’s divisional clash with the Arizona Cardinals.The 49ers know Purdy’s value stretches far beyond stats. Since taking over as starter, he has brought stability to an offense that had previously shuffled between Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo. His leadership has guided San Francisco to a 24-13 record, an NFC top seed, and earned him a long-term contract extension. With his proven ability to rally the team, the temptation to fast-track his return is high.The offseason addition of Mac Jones proved timely in Week 2, as he stepped in under center and helped the 49ers maintain their undefeated record. While Jones delivered a steady performance, the team’s offensive ceiling is clearly higher with Purdy on the field.San Francisco is also awaiting the return of Kittle and wideout Brandon Aiyuk, both vital to maintaining offensive rhythm. If Purdy can start against Arizona, his presence—alongside the return of other playmakers—could set the tone for a strong playoff push.Also Read: ""Not A Big Deal"": Ben Johnson shrugs off Tom Brady conflict of interest talk ahead of Bears-Raiders Week 4 clash For Shanahan, the key lies in not rushing Purdy back too soon.

Cardi B pregnancy ties into Stefon Diggs family story

Stefon Diggs family tree is back in the spotlight after Cardi B revealed she is pregnant with the New England Patriots wide receiver’s child. The rapper confirmed the news during a Sept. 17 interview on CBS Mornings, making it her fourth child and her first with Diggs. The announcement linked one of the NFL’s most productive receivers with one of the biggest names in music, sparking fresh attention on Diggs’ personal life and family roots.Stefon Diggs was born on Nov. 29, 1993, in Gaithersburg, Md., to Aron and Stephanie Diggs. His father, Aron, was instrumental in pushing his sons into football. He coached their youth teams, enforced discipline, and gave Diggs the work ethic that carried him into the NFL. Before passing away from congestive heart failure in 2008 at age 39, Aron told his son to take care of the family. “He just told me, ‘Look after your brothers. Look after your mom. Look after your family,’” Stefon recalled.Stephanie Diggs kept the family together after Aron’s death. She worked three decades at Amtrak while picking up jobs at Target and Toys R Us. Diggs has called her “Superwoman” for raising five kids while working multiple shifts.Today, she travels frequently to watch Stefon play for the Patriots and his younger son Trevon Diggs play cornerback for the Dallas Cowboys.Trevon Diggs is the most well-known of Stefon’s siblings. The Cowboys cornerback was drafted in 2020 and quickly became one of the league’s best at his position. Since their father’s death, Stefon has acted as a mentor and father figure to Trevon. “If you do good things, he’s gonna follow you. If you do bad things, he’s gonna follow you,” Stephanie once told Stefon. That advice defined the way the older brother guided the younger one.The family tree also includes Mar’Sean “Darez” Diggs, who played defensive back at UAB from 2016 to 2018. He shares the same father as Stefon but grew closer to him after Aron’s death. Aron Diggs Jr. is Stefon’s older half-brother, while sister Porsche Green has been described by Stephanie as the glue who helped keep the family together.The most private part of Stefon Diggs family tree is his daughter, Nova. Born in 2016, Nova has appeared alongside her father at NFL games and events but has largely been kept away from public attention. Diggs, who helped raise his siblings after their father’s death, has often spoken about responsibility and the importance of family, values that extend into his role as a parent.Cardi B and Stefon Diggs have been linked since 2024, spotted together at high-profile events like the Met Gala and Coachella. In September 2025, Cardi ended speculation by confirming she is pregnant with Diggs’ child. “I’m having a baby with my boyfriend, Stefon Diggs,” she told Gayle King. The baby is due before her Little Miss Drama tour begins in February 2026.Cardi credited Diggs with providing stability in her life. “He just makes me feel safe and very confident and very strong,” she said. The relationship adds another public layer to Diggs’ family tree, already built on resilience and responsibility. For a player whose life changed after stepping into the role of father figure as a teenager, the connection with Cardi marks the start of a new chapter.Cardi B confirmed she’s expecting her first child with Stefon Diggs but admitted she wanted to keep the news quiet for as long as she could. Speaking with Gayle King on CBS Mornings while promoting her new album Am I The Drama?, she explained why she delayed telling the public, and even her parents. “I just was like, ‘Can I just say it on my own time?’ Like, I’m not hiding. On my time, on my own terms. Let me close some deals first, you know what I’m saying? Let me close some deals first. ” She added, “And it’s like, you don’t really want to say right away that you’re pregnant. It’s like, ‘Let me see a couple of more sonograms. Let my baby be healthy.’”Her parents only recently found out, something she joked about: “They just be looking at me. I’m very scared of my parents!” Still, they’ve welcomed Diggs, who signed with the Patriots in March. Now that the secret’s out, Cardi’s tying the news back to her music. “By the way, now that I talked about it, y’all better get my album,” she told viewers. “Y’all wanted to know, right? Now you know. Now y’all can buy my album, so I can buy Pampers and diapers and all that type of stuff. I told y’all, now go support my album ’cause I’m a mother of four now!” Cardi already shares three kids, Blossom, 12 months, Kulture, 7, and Wave, 4, with her ex-husband, Offset.Cardi B gave fans a glimpse into her relationship with Stefon Diggs on Wednesday, Sept. 17, sharing a cozy selfie on X. The photo was dimly lit but showed the rapper smiling into the camera with her arm wrapped around the NFL star, while Diggs looked off to the side. She kept the caption simple, posting just a ""❤️"" alongside the snap.That same day, Cardi revealed on CBS Mornings that she’s expecting her fourth child, her first with Diggs, before her tour kicks off in February. ""I'm having a baby with my boyfriend, Stefon Diggs,"" she told Gayle King. The rapper, already mom to Kulture, Wave, and Blossom with estranged husband Offset, spoke about how this pregnancy feels different. ""I'm excited. I'm happy. I feel like I'm in a good space. I feel very strong, very powerful that I'm doing all this work, but I'm doing all this work while I'm creating a baby. "" Diggs, meanwhile, is dad to his 8-year-old daughter, Nova.","Stefon Diggs was born on Nov. 29, 1993, in Gaithersburg, Md., to Aron and Stephanie Diggs.

Raja Jackson’s violent outburst at KnokX Pro Wrestling led to his arrest

Rampage Jackson responds to son’s arrest



Raja Jackson, the 25-year-old son of UFC legend Quinton “Rampage” Jackson, has been arrested after a violent outburst at a Los Angeles wrestling event left one performer hospitalized. The incident, which occurred during a KnokX Pro Wrestling show in late August, quickly spiraled from a heated confrontation into a shocking assault that has now landed Raja behind bars on a felony charge. He is currently being held on $50,000 bond.According to footage that circulated online, Raja Jackson stormed the ring during wrestler Stuart “Syko Stu” Smith’s match on August 23. He lifted Smith and slammed him to the mat before unleashing more than 20 unanswered punches while Smith lay unconscious. Other wrestlers eventually rushed in to pull Raja away, but not before the brutal attack left the performer seriously injured, per TMZ.Smith was rushed to the hospital and spent several days under medical care. Doctors confirmed he suffered multiple facial injuries, including a fractured maxilla bone and significant dental damage. He has since been released and continues his recovery at home. Reportedly, a GoFundMe was launched to help with medical costs, with notable contributions coming from figures such as Mark Cuban and Chris Jericho.Witnesses claim the attack stemmed from a confrontation earlier in the evening. Smith had struck Raja with a beverage can as part of a staged interaction, believing Raja was part of the show. While an apology was offered and seemingly accepted, tensions carried over into the match, where Raja escalated the situation far beyond what anyone expected.Quinton “Rampage” Jackson, a former UFC light heavyweight champion known for his outspoken nature, has not shied away from criticizing his son’s actions. He admitted Raja had “no business being in the ring” and revealed that his son had recently suffered a concussion.“Raja’s wrong. He went against what I told him to do,” Rampage said in an interview. “Yes, my son took it too far. He knows better. He knows he’s wrong for getting involved in a pro-wrestling match. He wasn’t supposed to do it.”Despite his disappointment, Rampage said he still loves his son but believes accountability is necessary. “He should go to jail, not prison,” he added. “I think that he should do a little time, do a little community service, go to anger management class and therapy.”Also Read: ""My entire income is gone now"": Destiny claims Elon Musk and other conservatives got him banned from Twitch For now, Raja remains in custody amid the legal process. The wrestling academy condemned the incident, calling it a reckless and dangerous act that crossed every line of professional conduct.

My Opinion On This Mock Trade: A High-Risk, High-Reward Trade Deadline Prospect

Thefind themselves in a precarious position at third base in 2025. Projected starter Mark Vientos has struggled with injuries and inconsistency, while Brett Baty has yet to live up to expectations. This has left the Mets urgently seeking a game-changing bat.Enter- a proven All-Star with postseason pedigree and consistent offensive production. With reports linking the New York Mets to a possible blockbuster pursuit of Bregman, analysts believe such a move could reshape their lineup and playoff outlook.Alex Bregman, who signed a three-year, $120 million contract with Boston in early 2025, has opt-out clauses that could make him available before the offseason if extension talks stall. The New York Mets are now positioned as a leading candidate to acquire him, with trade rumors heating up as the deadline nears.A prominent trade proposal involves the New York Mets sending outfielder Starling Marte and top pitching prospect Nolan McLean (ranked No. 4 in their system) to Boston in exchange for Alex Bregman.• Starling Marte: Provides veteran leadership, a strong bat, and championship experience. His defensive versatility adds further value for the Red Sox.• Nolan McLean: A highly regarded pitching prospect with strong upside, offering Boston a long-term developmental piece.From Boston’s perspective, this package balances short-term competitiveness with future growth while offloading Bregman’s sizable contract. For the Mets, it represents an immediate solution at third base.Before suffering a quad injury earlier this season, Bregman was hitting .299 with an .839 OPS and 11 home runs, proving he remains in peak form. That kind of production is exactly what the New York Mets’ corner infield has been missing.• Mets: Gain a premier third baseman with proven postseason chops, immediately strengthening their playoff push while addressing a glaring hole in the lineup. This also helps mitigate uncertainty around Pete Alonso’s long-term future.• Red Sox: Offload a contract worth $80 million over the next two years (with opt-outs) while adding a veteran outfielder and a top prospect, giving them financial flexibility and depth.• Starling Marte: Lands in Boston with a chance to rejuvenate his career and help push the Red Sox toward contention.• Nolan McLean: Receives a clearer path to MLB action in an organization with room for pitching growth.• Alex Bregman: Joins a contender in the Mets, positioning himself for another deep postseason run while escaping Boston’s contract uncertainties.This table highlights the delicate balance: while both teams benefit in different ways, each must also accept notable risks.This comparison underscores Alex Bregman’s clear offensive superiority while also revealing the cost for New York in terms of prospects and salary commitment.If executed, this trade has the potential to be a win-win. The Mets stand to benefit most by addressing their biggest roster weakness with an elite talent, potentially boosting their World Series odds. The Red Sox gain flexibility, roster balance, and prospects, softening the blow of losing a superstar.Much depends on Alex Bregman’s health following his quad injury. If he returns to form, the New York Mets emerge as big winners. If not, they risk absorbing a massive financial commitment without payoff. Boston’s success hinges on Marte’s ability to contribute and McLean’s development.In the high-stakes world of MLB midseason trades, the New York Mets’ pursuit of Alex Bregman is one of the most intriguing storylines. Supported by Bregman’s track record and New York’s urgent positional needs, the move could transform their postseason outlook.Also read: Rumor Mill: Philadelphia Phillies Weigh $20 Million Contract Decision on Harrison Bader After Breakout Run For Boston, the trade offers a chance to reset financially and retool with new talent.

Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill is making headlines off the field as his ongoing divorce from Keeta Vaccaro collides with fresh dating rumors.

The tight end, known for his athleticism and catching ability, carries more than just his NFL aspirations on his helmet—he also displays the Canadian flag alongside the American stars and stripes, sparking curiosity about his connection to Canada.Born on October 18, 1999, in Las Vegas, Dalton Nevada, Kincaid didn’t start playing football until his senior year of high school, after friends convinced him to join the team. Prioritizing basketball until then, he quickly proved himself on the gridiron, racking up 745 yards and eight touchdowns in a single season.His early success earned him a spot at the University of San Diego, where he totaled 1,209 yards and 19 touchdowns in just two seasons before transferring to Utah.

The city sits on Lake Huron near the Michigan border, just an hour from Detroit, giving Kincaid a unique North American connection.Whether or not he visits Canada frequently, the Canadian flag represents a meaningful part of his identity.

Mike McDaniel under fire after Dolphins’ winless start



Dolphins’ ownership continues to back Mike McDaniel



The Miami Dolphins are staring at a troubling 0-2 start, and the pressure is mounting ahead of their primetime clash with the Buffalo Bills. With one of the league’s weakest showings in both scoring and defense so far, the team finds itself under intense scrutiny. At the heart of the discussion is head coach Mike McDaniel, who is now in his fourth year leading the Dolphins but still searching for postseason success.McDaniel’s tenure has been a mix of promise and frustration. His first three seasons delivered two playoff berths, but not a single postseason win. The Dolphins have consistently trailed the Bills in the AFC East, and this year’s rocky start has only fueled doubts about how long he will remain in charge.A crushing Week 1 defeat to the Indianapolis Colts raised alarm bells, and another setback against the Patriots left Miami desperate for answers. Entering Week 3, they are heavy underdogs against a Bills team considered among the league’s Super Bowl contenders.Still, analysts caution that Thursday’s result may not immediately decide McDaniel’s future. ESPN’s Peter Schrager noted, “If you get blown out tonight, it’s not good and there will be people calling for McDaniel’s head.If you lose to the Jets in Week 4 and start the season off 0-4 and losing on national TV two weeks in a row... that’s when we really start talking about this.”For now, owner Stephen Ross appears to be standing firmly behind his coach. NFL insider Ian Rapoport reported, “[Stephen Ross] does not want to fire Mike McDaniel, he doesn’t. He wants this to work – he likes him, he believes in him, he has invested in him, including a contract extension last year.”That loyalty comes with conditions. If players stop responding to McDaniel or fans begin to turn away, the pressure could quickly escalate. Yet, according to NFL Network’s Cameron Wolfe, the locker room has not lost faith: “No one expressed panic and no one said they’ve quit on their head coach.”Miami showed signs of improvement in Week 2, battling the Patriots closely before mental mistakes cost them the game. With upcoming matchups against the Jets and Panthers, opportunities exist to turn the tide. For now, McDaniel’s job appears safe, but continued losses could push this story in a very different direction.Also Read: Who is Tua Tagovailoa’s wife Annah Gore?

How Good Will Easton Cowan Be For The Leafs Next Season? | SDP

Easton Cowan ’s development sets stage for Maple Leafs training camp spotlight



The challenge ahead: Can Easton Cowan secure his place with the Maple Leafs?



When the Toronto Maple Leafs hit the ice for training camp this week, one name is bound to dominate conversations—Easton Cowan. The 20-year-old forward has been turning heads ever since his breakout season with the London Knights, where he piled up accolades, lifted the Memorial Cup, and proved himself as one of the brightest young stars in Canadian hockey. Now, the question isn’t about his potential—it’s about timing.Cowan enters camp with the kind of momentum most prospects can only dream of. Last season, he didn’t just score—he led, showcasing maturity and work ethic that stood out even in pressure-filled playoff moments. That’s exactly the kind of pedigree the Maple Leafs need as they reshape their forward group following Mitch Marner’s departure. Cowan’s blend of offensive creativity, vision, and willingness to battle in tough areas makes him a natural candidate to compete for a roster spot.The offseason was no vacation for Cowan. He spent the summer adding muscle and refining his defensive game, arriving in Toronto at 5-foot-11 and nearly 190 pounds. That commitment to improving away from the puck has only heightened his stock. As Cowan himself has said, being relentless on the forecheck and dependable defensively is the fastest way to unlock his offensive upside at the NHL level.Earning a job in Toronto won’t come easy. The Maple Leafs are deeper at forward than they’ve been in years, and every shift in camp will be a proving ground.Cowan must show he can handle the speed, physicality, and consistency demanded of an NHL regular. Still, his adaptability and fearless style could separate him from other prospects fighting for the same opportunity.Even if he starts the season with the Marlies, Cowan is poised to be one of the first call-ups when the Leafs need reinforcements. His story has quickly shifted from promising junior to legitimate NHL hopeful, and training camp is the stage where he can make that leap.For Maple Leafs fans, Easton Cowan isn’t just another prospect, he’s a glimpse of the future , and that future might arrive sooner than expected.Also Read: Connor McDavid’s wife Lauren Kyle hosted star-studded charity Poker night backing kids for Oilers Youth Foundation",Easton Cowan is a 20-year-old forward for the Toronto Maple Leafs.

Poll With Seville's victory, how do you see Jamaica's future in sprinting? Bright and promising Uncertain without Bolt Other countries will dominate It will remain competitive

Jamaica’s Oblique Seville finally fulfilled his promise on Sunday, winning the men’s 100 metres title at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, timing 9.77 seconds. The 24-year-old edged out renowned sprinters, including American Noah Lyles, the defending world and Olympic champion, and Jamaican teammate Kishane Thompson, to claim the gold.For Seville, the victory was the culmination of years of near misses. He had finished fourth at the 2022 and 2023 World Championships and made the semi-finals of the Covid-delayed Tokyo Olympics. Despite posting two Diamond League wins over Lyles this season, global glory had eluded him. “All the guys I competed with are very strong, so I have to maximise what I can do,” Seville reflected. He added that injuries had hampered his fitness in previous seasons, limiting his potential.Seville’s journey began in rural Jamaica, near Ness Castle, where poor roads did not prevent him from exploring sports. At Calabar High School, he played cricket and football and enjoyed swimming, but track and field ultimately became his focus. A huge influence on his career has been sprint legend Usain Bolt , whom Seville describes as “my motivator”. Bolt’s guidance has been invaluable, offering advice both on life and sprinting.Now coached by Glen Mills, Bolt’s former mentor, Seville said he felt privileged to be under Mills’ tutelage. “We all watched Usain Bolt as kids! I wanted coach Mills to be my coach… He’s a very intelligent man,” Seville said. Bolt still occasionally visits training sessions, offering insight and encouragement, particularly after the death of Seville’s father. “Since my father passed away, Usain’s my motivator,” he added.Seville also highlighted the bright future of Jamaican sprinting. Before his win, he had predicted a resurgence led by himself, Ackeem Blake, and Kishane Thompson. With Sunday’s triumph, Jamaica claimed its first men’s 100m world title in ten years, the last being Bolt in 2015. “We have a great level… All of the US athletes are over 25, so in the future we are going to be on top again,” Seville said.","Jamaica's Oblique Seville won the men's 100 metres title at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo.

Who are the rookies joining the Blackhawks this season?

The Chicago Blackhawks are opening up a training camp on Thursday, following a busy week of rookie camp and the Tom Kurvers Prospect Showcase. The excitement now shifts to the young players on the roster, ready to join practice with the older players.As per reports, young standouts will join established veterans in preparation for the 2025-26 NHL season. It will include Connor Bedard, Frank Nazar, and Alex Vlasic. But, beyond these marquee names, training camp will offer an opportunity to the veterans, such as Ryan Donato, Andre Burakovsky, Teuvo Teravainen, Nick Lardis, and more. Let’s take a closer look at the lineup of the veterans and rookies who are going to join the team this season.One of the veterans that fans should expect to watch out for this season in the Chicago Blackhawks is Ryan Donato, who inked a contract extension this summer before hitting free agency, and is all set to join his first career 30-goal season. According to reports, it is said that he thrived in Chicago last year, and management is banking on his consistency as a key offensive contributor.While repeating 30 goals may be something very big for him, however, the team is expecting Ryan Donato to play a pivotal role in the Blackhawks’ attack.Moreover, his conditioning and form during camp will be closely watched so that he can work on his loopholes and prepare to build on a breakout campaign this season.Another player who is joining Donato is Andre Burakovsky, a two-time Stanley Cup champion . It is to be noted that Burakovsky has set foot in Chicago after a long hiatus, battling injuries and inconsistencies in Seattle. The training camps will provide the first glimpse at how he’s adapting to his new surroundings and what he can offer as a stabilizing presence following his long gap from gap.Teuvo Teravainen is again returning to Chicago with valuable experience and skill. He has consistently been one of the team’s most reliable performers last season. Now entering camp, he’s aiming to secure his place as a top-six spot while also making a case for Olympic selection with Team Finland. This season, it is expected that Teravainen will showcase his ability to complement Chicago’s fast, youthful core and prove he remains a difference-maker at the NHL level.Nick Lardis is one of the rookies whom the team is really counting on. After an impressive season in the OHL where he scored a jaw-dropping 71 goals, Lardis has emerged as one of the most promising young talents in the organization. His strong showing at rookie camp has raised the bar, and this season, he will need to prove his expertise in games against NHL-level competition. Although he will start in the AHL, a standout performance in camp could just land him a spot on the opening-night roster.Joining him, Marek Vanacker will also appear as a rookie following a major injury that sidelined him a year ago. Vanacker closed last season with a stint in the AHL and is expected to spend more time there in 2025-26. At this training session, his performance will indicate how close he is to breaking through. If he impresses, fans may not have to wait long to see his NHL debut.","The Chicago Blackhawks are opening up a training camp on Thursday, following a busy week of rookie camp and the Tom Kurvers Prospect Showcase.

Tense faces! Pakistan cricket team arrive at ICC Academy | Will they boycott Asia Cup?

Poll Should Saim Ayub be dropped from the starting XI due to his batting form? Yes, he needs to be replaced No, he should be given more chances

NEW DELHI: Pakistan set up another high-stakes clash with arch-rivals India in the Asia Cup after a 41-run win over the United Arab Emirates in Dubai on Wednesday. But amid the victory and the off-field dramas, all eyes were on young opener Saim Ayub, whose poor run with the bat continued.The 23-year-old left-hander registered his third straight duck of the tournament — following scores of 0 against Oman and India — when he was dismissed cheaply again against the UAE. While Pakistan’s bowlers and Fakhar Zaman ’s 50 off 36 balls bailed the team out, questions are mounting over Saim’s place in the XI.Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif, however, urged patience and defended the youngster, highlighting that Saim has been contributing with the ball. “Kabhi kabaar aisa hota hai, banda oont pad baitha hai aur kutta kaat jata hai, uske saath yahi ho raha hai [Sometimes it happened, the guy is sitting on camel and dog bites him anyhow],” Latif remarked, using a colourful metaphor to describe the batter’s lean patch.“Woh kaha par catch hokar out ho gaya... kabhi yu maara toh out ho gaya, kabhi aise mara toh out ho gaya. Bura time aata hai sabka. Yeh bowling se apne team me khel raha hai.Bade match me kissi me fodega. ya toh phoot jaega ya phod dega [He is getting out playing different shots. Bad phases come for everyone. He is in the team for his bowling currently. But he will explode in big games],” he added, predicting that Saim will either fail spectacularly or come good in a big game.Saim’s right-arm spin has already fetched six wickets in three games — 2/8 vs Oman, 3/35 vs India, and 1/18 vs UAE — a key reason behind his retention despite batting failures.With Pakistan and India both securing qualification from Group A, fans will not have to wait long to see if Latif’s prophecy comes true, as the arch-rivals clash again in Dubai on Sunday.",Pakistan beat United Arab Emirates by 41 runs in Asia Cup Group A match.

Jason Kelce’s evolving fashion sense wins playful praise from Kylie Kelce



Kylie Kelce is opening up about her husband’s evolving style and the hair choices that sparked both admiration and frustration over the years. On the latest episode of her podcast, Not Gonna Lie with Kylie Kelce, the 33-year-old shared which looks she adored on Jason Kelce, 37, and the one haircut she could barely stand.Answering a fan question, Kylie revealed that Jason’s look has stayed true to himself since the early days of their relationship. “He had long hair when we first started dating. He had the man bun,” she recalled, adding that he eventually cut it because “he couldn't comfortably put his head back on the sofa.” For Kylie, that style worked. “I'll tell you what. He looked very good with a man bun,” she said.The mother of four admitted that Jason also pulled off a clean fade, saying, “he looked damn good with a fade.” Photos online, she added, prove that he looked “great with a man.”But not every haircut earned her approval. “I will say the one, which we were already married, the one haircut he knows that I came very close to shaving his head in his sleep. Full transparency was the mullet,” Kylie confessed. While she joked that Jason might have done it just to annoy her, she begrudgingly admitted, “he kinda made it look good.”Beyond hairstyles, Kylie pointed out how Jason’s fashion has shifted. “It’s gotten a little funky,” she said with a laugh, highlighting his bold Bluey-themed two-piece outfit from an Amazon Port panel in June. “To be able to make that a thirst trap? You kidding?”Jason himself explained his choice at the event: “It’s Father’s Day, so I figured I’d embrace my inner child.My girls would appreciate this outfit, for sure.”Together, Jason and Kylie are raising four children—Wyatt, 5, Elliotte, 4, Bennett, 2, and baby Finn, just 4 months.

Jake Browning's contract details for 2025

Jake Browning's career earnings and estimated net worth

The Cincinnati Bengals' backup quarterback, Jake Browning, has become a key player in the team's 2025 season. Browning stepped into the starter role after Joe Burrow, the starter, kept on turf toe, got injured, and has piloted the Bengals to a 2-0 start. That performance, highlighted by the game-winning touchdown against the Jacksonville Jaguars, has captured the attention of the nation and could soon catch the eyes of team executives considering his contract and earnings.Jake Browning signed a two-year, $1,945,000 contract with the Cincinnati Bengals in April of 2024. The deal runs through the 2025 season and averages $1,030,000 per year in base salary in addition to that cap hit. It is his biggest cash payout to date, an indication of a greater role and increasing importance to the team.The lucrative contract features performance incentives and roster bonuses that could entice Browning to earn even more money in the event he keeps playing as well as he did on the field. Browning would get the chance to prove it during the second half of the season if, as is expected, Burrow has to miss time to recover from a strained wrist ligament, which takes on far larger implications, as the better he plays now, the more money he might command in free agency as early as 25 months from now.Also Read: Joe Burrow exits game with toe injury, Jake Browning expected to take over as Bengals QB As of 2025, Jake Browning's career earnings total approximately $200k. His net worth is $350k, including his NFL contracts and additional earnings. Although these numbers are a little more modest than some of his counterparts, Browning is coming off back-to-back solid seasons as a starter and should easily make plenty of money down the road playing the way he has.Joe Burrow is projected to return in December, but Jake Browning's performance over the next few months could be pivotal for both his prospects and the Bengals' playoff hopes. Given his contract, pay, and value to the team, it's an excellent time for this player, and, in the years to come, if he continues to succeed, he will possibly get big contracts and endorsements when he is older, too.","Jake Browning signed a two-year, $1,945,000 contract with the Cincinnati Bengals in April of 2024.

A bitter blow to the Tokyo Dome hopes

“Japan’s greatest fighters taking on the world.”

Naoya Inoue ’s title defense becomes Saudi Arabia’s latest sporting prize

Japanese boxing fans were preparing for a historic night at the Tokyo Dome this December, but those plans have been stripped away. Instead, the much-hyped Ring V: Night of the Samurai will now be staged at Riyadh’s Mohammed Abdo Arena on December 27.The move was confirmed by Turki Alalshikh, chairman of Saudi Arabia ’s General Entertainment Authority. He labelled the night asWhile fighters will earn record paydays, the decision has sparked frustration among Japanese fans, who are left with only local broadcasts instead of the chance to witness history in person.The shift is a major setback to Japanese fans. With Naoya “The Monster” Inoue headlining and Junto Nakatani in a co-feature, the Tokyo card was set to break every record in the nation’s boxing history - from ticket sales to broadcast revenue. Industry insiders expected it to eclipse legendary nights at the Dome, such as Mike Tyson’s bouts in the 1990s. Instead, the action moves to a 22,000-seat venue in Saudi Arabia, nearly three times smaller than the Dome’s capacity of 55,000.At the top of the card, Inoue defends his undisputed super bantamweight crown against Mexico’s unbeaten Alan Picasso. Fresh off a commanding win over Murodjon Akhmadaliev, Inoue has reinforced himself as one of the sport’s top pound-for-pound fighters.For Saudi Arabia, landing his headline bout is another milestone in its growing boxing portfolio, following Tyson Fury vs Oleksandr Usyk and Anthony Joshua’s recent fights in Riyadh.Backing him is three-weight world champion Junto Nakatani, who moves up to super bantamweight to face hard-hitting Sebastian Hernandez. A victory could line him up for an all-Japanese super fight with Inoue - something fans hope will finally happen in Tokyo next year. Moreover, former light flyweight king Kenshiro Teraji looks to rebound after losing his titles.Also Read: Japanese Boxing Commission announces urgent safety reforms after deaths of Shigetoshi Kotari and Hiromasa Urakawa Japan stands at the heart of a once-in-a-generation wave of boxing talent, including Inoue, Nakatani, Teraji, Imanaga, the Tsutsumi brothers, and many more. Yet their biggest night won’t happen on home soil. Riyadh isn’t just hosting big boxing cards; it’s becoming a hub for MMA, WWE-style events, and massive international tournaments under its Riyadh Season initiative. What promises glory for Inoue and Nakatani in Riyadh delivers only distance for their loyal supporters.","The much-hyped Ring V: Night of the Samurai will now be staged at Riyadh’s Mohammed Abdo Arena on December 27.

Penguins , Devils , and Blackhawks bet on depth through PTO signings with Matt Grzelcyk and more

Wild , Hurricanes, and other teams look for experience in camps as Jack Johnson and Milan Lucic return

NYR Training Camp: Chris Drury and Mike Sullivan Media Availability | September 17, 2025

The training camps of the NHL in 2025 are very much in the limelight, so to speak, as several familiar names hit the ice for the first time on PTOs. This is the last chance afforded to the unsigned veterans to prove that they still have what it takes to make it in the league, while teams look to test depth with experienced legs ahead of the beginning of the regular season on October 7. From Stanley Cup winners to candidates for last jobs on playoff-tested experience: Most of these would be casinos on one last NHL contract with their experience.The Penguins' PTO signing list reads the name of forward Robby Fabbri, a skilled player who racked up 16 points in 44 games last season with Anaheim and who Pittsburgh is hoping can provide some scoring depth alongside Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. New Jersey's PTO list of players includes forwards Luke Glendening and Kevin Rooney, both good defensively and strong on penalty kills. The Blackhawks' PTO signing takes Matt Grzelcyk to Chicago, where he could anchor their blue line after an impressive 40-point campaign with the Penguins last year.The Minnesota Wild have also signed PTOs in defenseman Jack Johnson, a 2022 Stanley Cup winner, and forward Brett Leason, who is trying to land a bottom-six role. The Hurricanes are among the breakout PTO players: Oliver Kylington, Kevin Labanc, and Givani Smith all have varying skill sets that could fit into a bit of versatility.Milan Lucic remains on the St. Louis Blues for an NHL comeback, and Tyler Motte is gunning for a roster spot on the Florida Panthers, while Conor Sheary joins the New York Rangers on a PTO after winning two Stanley Cups in Pittsburgh. Brendan Smith closes the list, attempting to sign with the Columbus Blue Jackets.Also Read: Mikael Backlund signs 2-year extension with Calgary Flames This list of NHL 2025 PTO signings highlights the tremendous value training camps hold for both players and teams. For the players, it’s the last chance to demonstrate their skills and land another NHL contract. For the franchises, it's a way to do last-minute valuations on some experienced talent at very little risk before the season. With less than a month before opening night, all eyes will be on which of these veterans actually turn their tryouts into actual roster spots.","Penguins, Devils, and Blackhawks bet on depth through PTO signings with Matt Grzelcyk and more.

Injury update: Pittsburgh Penguins forward Rutger McGroarty is out indefinitely,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/injury-update-pittsburgh-penguins-forward-rutger-mcgroarty-is-out-indefinitely/articleshow/123979339.cms,"Rutger McGroarty (Image Via Twitter)

Rutger McGroarty 's injury timeline with impact on Pittsburgh Penguins

Penguins' options without Rutger McGroarty in the lineup

The NHL season has only just begun in a few days, and now the injury bug has started making headlines everywhere. Teams have to adjust their lineups before the puck is even dropped, with major players down on the injured lists. The Pittsburgh Penguins are among those hit by injury, as forward Rutger McGroarty now faces an indefinite absence in a window of unavailable time due to a mysterious upper-body injury. Now, with this setback, there is further uncertainty for the Penguins with early-season scheduling.Penguins GM Kyle Dubas mentioned that McGroarty will be out indefinitely and that they are going to remain patient with the 21-year-old forward. A very frustrating development for both player and team. McGroarty had been acquired from Winnipeg in a rare prospect-for-prospect deal and was expected to battle for a top-six role come fall. Now, with his indefinite absence, he will most likely miss the beginning of the season.Last year, the former Wolverine showed what he's made of, spending time in development splits between AHL Wilkes-Barre/Scranton and a brief stint with the Penguins.He piled 39 points in 60 AHL contests and put up three points in five NHL games before a lower-body injury ended his campaign early. Ranked by numerous media outlets as the No. 1 prospect in Pittsburgh, McGroarty entered this camp off a strong building momentum. This injury now stops that momentum at a pivotal point in his development.With McGroarty unavailable, other forwards will be fighting for those precious roster spots. Ville Koivunen, who staked a claim by gaining 56 points in the AHL last season but also showed flashes during his NHL stint, could assume a larger role. Apart from that, the venerable Anthony Mantha has been vying for a position as well and may well get paid off in the first line. For Pittsburgh, how to weigh the experience of an aging core with the growth of younger guys remains a fine line, and the absence of McGroarty makes that all the more difficult.Also Read: Brad Marchand surprised by Florida Panthers contract extension ahead of free agency With Rutger McGroarty sidelined through injury, the Pittsburgh Penguins lose more than just depth—they lose a possible difference-maker just on the brink of having opportunities open to him. While the other players will rise to the occasion, the organization will be yearning for the swift recovery of their top prospect and seeing him return to his upward trajectory as a regularly contributing NHLer.","Pittsburgh Penguins forward Rutger McGroarty has been ruled out indefinitely with an upper-body injury.

Kirill Kaprizov's contract negotiations and Minnesota Wild 's standpoint

Kaprizov extension and its wild possible season outlook

Truly anxious Minnesota fans and those of the National Hockey League are keeping checking every update about Panther Kirill Kaprizov 's contract situation, hopeful that there might be a deal for the star winger to stay put with the Wild. With unrestricted free agency looming and entering the final year of his contract, speculation has been running wild. While supporters want definite answers, will Kaprizov remain the franchise cornerstone for Minnesota, or will he venture into free agency? The team, on their part, is striving toward this historic long-term deal.Minnesota Wild GM Bill Guerin has denied all reports of tension between the franchise and Kaprizov during the proceedings. Guerin further confessed that, ""The most important thing is that we want to sign Kirill. He's our franchise player."" Although a record-setting offer of eight years, $128 million has been proposed from the Wild, breaking the NHL record with a cap hit of $16 million a year, far above anything else in league history.Several days back, media reports surfaced about an impending decision regarding the wonderful winger Kirill Kaprizov. However, despite public interest, the Wild have been fixated on keeping Kaprizov and have not entertained offers presented in any negotiations related to his future. Insider reports mention that both the team and the winger want to come together to finally agree, so the hopes remain alive for a win-win situation.The 28-year-old offensive winger has cemented his place in the NHL as a credible goal scorer and team player, scoring 23 goals and 52 points in 37 games last season before suffering a lower-body injury, which kept him off the ice for a while.Assuring a potential extension for Kaprizov holds considerable sway over the competitive plans of the Wild. Being the team's top scorer and three-time All-Star, he is really at the center of the Minnesota strategy and hopes for a deep run in the postseason. Kaprizov has scored 185 goals and 386 points in 319 career games, including his rookie season when he took home the Calder Trophy. Long-term retention of Kaprizov would solidify the Wild's top offensive line and also serve as a declaration to home crowds and rivals alike that Minnesota is aiming to be a serious contender for quite some time in the NHL.Also Read: Mikael Backlund signs 2-year extension with Calgary Flames As the NHL offseason continues, many media outlets continue to get their information on the status of Kirill Kaprizov's contract.

Christian Benford shocks fans as he remains down for several tense moments

Christian Benford returns at midfield and locks back into his boundary corner spot with no hesitation

On September 18, 2025, during the primetime game of Week 3 featuring the AFC East rivals Buffalo Bills and Miami Dolphins at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, a gripping moment took place that engaged both fans and players. Buffalo's promising cornerback, Christian Benford, faced a harsh hit while defending against a deep pass, triggering quick concern for the Bills' secondary. Yet, demonstrating his toughness, Benford promptly bounced back and rejoined the game, assisting in stabilizing a defense that was already weakened by missing players.The occurrence happened with 9:01 still on the clock in the third quarter, during a vital third-and-11 for Miami from their own 42-yard line. With the Bills leading 21-14 after a touchdown, Tagovailoa stepped back and sent a deep ball down the sideline aimed at Hill, Miami's star wideout recognized for his 4.29-second 40-yard dash speed. Benford, closely trailing Hill, jumped to challenge the pass, leaving the ground in an attempt to break up the play.As Benford ascended, Bills safety Taylor Rapp, offering assistance from the deep safety role, also jumped in to aid the coverage.The two defenders crashed into each other mid-air, which reporters referred to as ""friendly fire""—an unfortunate mix-up among teammates going for the same area. The ball was deemed incomplete after a review, maintaining Buffalo's lead and forcing a punt from the Dolphins.The stop came with a hefty price tag, though. Benford tumbled to the ground awkwardly, immediately clutching his abdomen and curling up into a ball, a usual sign that someone has had the wind knocked out of them. He stayed on his knees, face down, for several tense moments as the MetLife Stadium crowd and viewers at home held their breath. Medical staff and trainers rushed to his side, surrounding him on the field to evaluate the situation.The dramatic footage, widely distributed in social networks and on TV streams, enjoys access to: Benford marking up the air, when he smashes directly into the face of Rapp, and a necking sigh followed by movement on the ground of the corner touchdown player.A video filmed by Bills beat reporter Alex Brasky at X depicted how Rapp was dropped off a top rope by some ways to demonstrate just how strong the impact was. This was the time highlighting how most physical USC was required to defend against the vertical game of Miami where Hill is a deep threat making the secondary make decisions swiftly.Benford wasted no time getting over the shock. He returned for the Bills' following offensive series, which kicked off at the 50-yard line after the Dolphins' punt. Sporting his No. 47 jersey, Benford got back into his boundary corner spot opposite Hill, playing a key role in a three-and-out defensive stand that forced Miami deep into their own end.His comeback was smooth, no hesitation in his coverage, and he showed no limp or signs of favoring his midsection. By the time the game wrapped up, Benford had added two more tackles to his stats, totaling three, and he helped keep Hill to just five catches for 78 yards on 10 targets. The Bills' defense as a unit sacked Tagovailoa twice in the second half, forcing a turnover on downs that secured a 28-24 victory for Buffalo, improving their record to 3-0.After the game, the locker room was all about the victory, but Benford's determination got some quiet recognition. Offensive tackle Dion Dawkins chatted with NFL Network's Michael Robinson and highlighted the calmness of the secondary, ""We rally around our brothers—Benford went down fighting and came back stronger. That's Bills football.""Also Read: New England Patriots receiver Stefon Diggs brushes off Cardi B pregnancy questions with a cold response Christian Benford coming back after that tough hit wasn’t just about bouncing back; it was a bold display of toughness and resolve that really set the vibe for the Buffalo Bills’ secondary, leaving both fans and teammates impressed.","Buffalo Bills cornerback Christian Benford took a harsh hit while defending against a deep pass.

Poll Do you think it’s important for public figures like Bjorn Borg to share personal struggles with addiction? Absolutely, it can inspire others Yes, but only if they feel comfortable Not really, it's their personal life

Swedish tennis icon Bjorn Borg has made a deeply personal revelation in his newly released autobiography Heartbeats: A Memoir, published on Thursday, disclosing his long-hidden battles with cocaine addiction and a recent prostate cancer diagnosis.The 69-year-old former world No.1, who dominated tennis in the 1970s and early 1980s, confessed that his first experience with cocaine in the early 1980s at New York’s legendary nightclub Studio 54 gave him “a rush as strong as what tennis had given me in the past.”His darkest years, Borg recounts, came in the 1990s when he was living in Milan with then-wife, Italian singer Loredana Bertè. “We had bad influences, and… drugs and pills within reach. There, I was plunged into the deepest darkness,” Borg writes.The low point arrived in 1996, when Borg collapsed on a bridge in the Netherlands just before an exhibition tournament. “When I awoke in hospital, my father was standing next to me. He said nothing, it was so embarrassing. I was terribly ashamed,” he told Swedish talk show Skavlan.In the memoir, Borg also reveals that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in September 2023.“The risk of it coming back still exists, and it’s something I will have to live with… with the anxiety of not knowing if the cancer was caught in time,” he wrote, adding that he undergoes check-ups every six months.Despite his health challenges, Borg stressed that he exercises daily, though he admitted he has not “played tennis in six years.”The 11-time Grand Slam champion also touched on doping in modern tennis, expressing concern about junior players and questioning Jannik Sinner’s decision to rehire fitness coach Umberto Ferrara after the Italian’s brief suspension for a steroid violation.Borg, who retired shockingly at just 26 after conquering Wimbledon five times and the French Open six times, said his memoir is about confronting demons, shame, and survival.",Tennis great Bjorn Borg has released his autobiography Heartbeats: A Memoir.
