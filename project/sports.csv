'We don't look at averages and stats': Gautam Gambhir on sending Axar Patel at No. 5

NEW DELHI: Eyebrows were raised when India announced five spinners in the team for the ICC Champions Trophy . Historically, the pitches in Dubai do not overly favour spinners. However, the venue has also just got done with the month-long ILT20 league which may have left the pitches tired and more amenable to spin. Predominantly, though, India’s spinner-heavy squad was chosen to lengthen the batting lineup, TOI has learnt.The trend emerging from head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s tenure is the inclination to have more allrounders in the lineup across formats. Gambhir has been vocal about the need to bat deep. Seambowling allrounders are a rarity at the moment. Hence, Washington Sundar too has made the cut along with Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja Interestingly, it was Gambhir who insisted on having Shivam Dube back in the ODI scheme of things by adding him to the list of non-travelling reserves, say insiders.Gambhir is someone who prefers to have more options in the playing XI. More allrounders give him the chance to be flexible. If India advance in the tournament, spinners are likely to play a greater role.The idea, according to those in the know of developments, is simple — play two steady finger-spinners who can bat well to complement either Kuldeep Yadav or Varun Chakravarthy . Kuldeep and Chakravarthy are seen as genuine strike options. If the pitches at the start look like they can produce big runs, one might see Chakravarthy in the XI ahead of Kuldeep. The majority of Chakravarthy’s wickets have come while the batters have been looking to push the scoring rate. Kuldeep is seen as someone who can deceive the batter in the air and lure him into a false shot, like he did against England in the last ODI in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.Also See: Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 There are other factors too. India have played two Asia Cups at the venue over the last seven years and never played more than two frontline spinners in the XI.Jasprit Bumrah’s absence and Mohammed Shami being rusty after a long injury layoff has played a part in India picking a spin-heavy attack which can compensate for the inexperience of the two new pacers, Harshit Rana and Arshdeep Singh. It will be interesting to see how India’s campaign unfolds on the Dubai pitches, which usually sport a layering of grass to prevent the surface from cracking up.","The trend emerging from head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s tenure is the inclination to have more allrounders in the lineup across formats.

has apparently taken a subtle jab at their recently traded superstarwho made his departure from the to play alongside the Los Angeles Lakers in a surprising blockbuster trade. While the Mavericks have received Anthony Davis , the team has been under severe backlash from fans and analysts alike. However, the Mavericks have been quite clear on their stance. After previously citing Doncic’s fitness issue, the Mavericks' head coach has recently given subtle hints that Doncic was the reason for two of their top stars— Kyrie Irving Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd subtly suggested that Luka Doncic played a role in Kyrie Irving and Klay Thompson’s struggles, though he never mentioned him by name addressing him as just “the player we traded”. The team has been navigating a season of highs and lows, with Irving and Thompson stepping up after the blockbuster trade that sent Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers.“(Kyrie) is gonna get more shots, Klay will get more shots, everybody will get more shots just because of the player that we traded. He was involved in everything,” Kidd said.Kidd has been careful with his words, consistently avoiding direct references to Doncic in press conferences. Meanwhile, the Mavs continue adjusting to their new roster, hoping that their latest acquisitions can keep them competitive in a tough Western Conference.Reports suggest the move wasn’t just about basketball— it also stemmed from concerns over discipline, effort, and chemistry.In Doncic’s absence, the Mavericks’ new superstar Anthony Davis has sparked concern over his injuries. He is currently sidelined which propelled Kyrie Irving to take charge. “For Kai, we joke about the 42 and zero last night. It wasn’t that he wasn’t looking to pass—it’s that those passes come out of a double-team,” Kidd said of the 32-year-old standout. “That leads to Klay or someone else benefitting from a wide-open three or an open layup. The hockey assist isn’t part of the NBA stat line, but it should be. He led the scoring by getting calls in the double-team,” he added.With injuries piling up, the Mavericks need their bench to step up as the season nears its final stretch. Irving missed the game against the Heat due to right shoulder soreness, leaving a gap in the backcourt. Anthony Davis, acquired in the blockbuster Doncic trade, was also sidelined after suffering an injury in his Dallas debut.Also Read: Luka Doncic gives unfiltered opinion on Los Angeles Lakers head coach JJ Redick’s leadership Without two of their biggest stars, the Mavs could face a tough challenge staying competitive in the Western Conference.

is medically retiring from the NFL. He posted on Instagram a farewell message, noting that he'll be back to tailgate.

The farewell message on Buffalo Bills OL Tommy Doyle's Instagram post read

What an adventure. The highs, the lows. The wins, the losses. The adversity, the lessons, the brotherhood—every moment has shaped me. After battling through injuries and dealing with nerve damage, I've made the tough decision to retire from the NFL.

I wanted to be upfront and address it rather than rumors and speculation.

As much as I wanted to keep pushing, I trust that God's plan is greater than mine.

To my teammates, coaches, family, trainers, and friends—you made this ride unforgettable. To the Pegula family and the entire Bills organization—thank you for believing in me. And to the city of Buffalo and the Bills Mafia—your love and support have meant everything.

This isn't goodbye—it's just the next chapter. Can't wait to be back next season, tailgating with y'all.

WOW this is sad for the Bills but Thank you Tommy! Good luck on the next chapter!

""Congrats Tommy! I know fans will talk about your TD but that's not what I'll remember. You are one of the toughest players the Bills ever had. Pick me another one who tore an ACL like he did in the 'heat' game @ Miami but kept on playing because there was no one else!! Crazy

Back-to-back injuries in the NFL matches have led the offensive lineman for the Buffalo Bills , Tommy Doyle, to opt for early retirement.

Sports Reporter for the Buffalo News, Katherine Fitzgerald, took to her X and shared,❤️💙""In 2022, Tommy Doyle suffered a seriously torn ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) in his right knee. ACL tears take six to nine months to recover. Statistically speaking, offensive tackles rarely suffer from ACL tears unless they perform guard or center role or even the running back or wide receiver role. Maybe Tommy Doyle wanted to be more than an offensive tackle.OL Tommy Doyle was meant to be greater than that. There's no award also for the offensive linemen in the NFL. Another Buffalo Bills offensive tackle, Dion Dawkins, had even urged the NFL to create an award for the offensive linemen. They protect the quarterbacks or whoever is with The Duke. That's the most, most important role. There's nothing higher than that on the NFL grass, yet nothing happened.Young talents like OL Tommy Doyle force themselves to achieve astronomical heights because their positions often go neglected.

Each rack contains five balls: four regular balls worth one point and one ""money ball"" worth two points. The fifth rack, chosen by the player, consists entirely of money balls. Additionally, two ""Starry range"" balls, placed deeper than the standard three-point line, are worth three points each.The top three scorers from the first round advance to the finals, where the format repeats. In case of ties, a 30-second tiebreaker round determines advancement, while a full 70-second round decides the winner.The event is straightforward, requiring only an NBA referee to oversee the competition. The referee ensures players stay behind the line and confirms each made basket. This year’s lineup includes stars like Jalen Brunson (Knicks), Buddy Hield (Warriors), and defending champion Damian Lillard (Bucks).The 3-Point Contest tips off on Saturday, Feb. 15, at 8 p.m. ET from the Chase Center in San Francisco.

Taylor Swift Has “Distanced” Herself From Blake Lively Because Of This Reason, Fans Say



Blake Lively Was Not Spotted With Taylor Swift At Super Bowl 2025



Taylor Swift, the billionaire pop star, has been in the news since she got booed at the Super Bowl last weekend when Travis Kelce’s team, the Kansas City Chiefs lost the trophy to the Philadelphia Eagles. Away from the Super Bowl drama, the pop star has also found herself involved in the legal drama between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni. But now, the reason why Taylor Swift has “distanced” herself from Blake Lively is pretty clear, according to fans.Taylor Swift has remained pretty silent about the whole controversial situation and is yet to make an official announcement about it. It seems like fans have found the reason behind it.A fan took to X and wrote, “The fact that Taylor Swift, huge advocate of the womens movement, didnt support bestie Blake Lively speaks volumes. If anyone would support, know and have proof that Blake was harrassed it would be Taylor Swift. Talks, calls, texts...Yet Taylor didn't support it. Hmmm”Another fan wrote, “If my bestfriend who made me godmother to her children was in a legal battle over sexual harassment & retaliation, I would be standing ten toes down with her. I would not abandon her. The fact that Taylor Swift distanced herself from Blake Lively is damning enough.”While it is not confirmed why Taylor Swift has not been spotted recently with her best friend, Blake Lively, fans are pretty convinced that this is the reason behind it.For the unversed, Blake Lively had accused Justin Baldoni of harassment and Justin filed a counter lawsuit against Blake Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds accusing them of defamation and trying to take over control of their blockbuster movie, It Ends With Us. Taylor Swift was named by Justin Baldoni in the lawsuit as he felt Blake Lively tried to “use” Taylor Swift’s power and influence to gain control of the movie.Many fans also expected to see Taylor Swift and Blake Lively at the Super Bowl held last weekend but Blake was nowhere to be found at the stadium. This was in complete contrast to the 2024 Super Bowl when Blake Lively was spotted cheering on Travis Kelce as she stood next to Taylor Swift. The two were also spotted hugging each other when the Kansas City Chiefs won the trophy last year.A few days ago, a source revealed to Page Six that “Taylor really wishes Blake hadn’t dragged her into this whole situation.” This might be true considering how Taylor Swift has avoided being spotted with Blake Lively.With the Chiefs losing the Super Bowl, both Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have been trolled but have remained silent.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld reacts as Josh Allen gets asked out on a date during their appearance at NFL Honors","Taylor Swift has been in the news since she got booed at the Super Bowl last weekend when Travis Kelce’s team, the Kansas City Chiefs lost the trophy to the Philadelphia Eagles.

Poll What Are You Looking Forward to for India in the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy? Strategic and Innovative Gameplay Outstanding Teamwork and Collaboration

India’s squad for ICC Champions Trophy, 2025:

Late in the afternoon on February 15, an unusual frenzy gripped the business class arrivals lounge of the Dubai International Airport. The word had travelled that the Indian cricket team was going to land shortly and plenty of fans had assembled to catch a glimpse of their favourite superstars. The area which generally sees passengers quietly make their way to the fleet of luxury vehicles waiting outside was buzzing with activity.Security officials were working overdrive when the flight carrying the Men in Blue landed on the runway. Few luggage trolleys were used to cordon off the area and the intensity picked up when the local police directed everyone to vacate the lounge area and head to the parking lot outside. There were loud cheers when head coach Gautam Gambhir led the entourage to the team bus. Everyone - from Virat Kohli to Hardik Pandya to Shreyas Iyer - acknowledged the fans while boarding the team bus.When the players took their respective seats, the waiting fans kept looking inside because captain Rohit Sharma was yet to exit the building. And when he did, there were loud cheers for the Hitman who walked briskly to the waiting bus and even summoned the security official for some instructions. Did he forget something again? Eh, not quite sure but you never know! The bus left the airport and KL Rahul, who made his way out at least 20 minutes after the team, took a separate car to the team hotel.Business as usual resumed after that and the usual calm was restored to the business class arrivals lounge. The ICC Champions Trophy 's first match in Dubai is still some days away and the buzz has naturally been missing in the city. And quite understandably so. Only India would be parked here because the rest of the teams will play their matches in Pakistan, the official hosts of the tournament. The teams allotted fixtures vs India will travel to Dubai and then head back as per the hybrid arrangement okayed by the International Cricket Council (ICC).The tournament gets underway on February 19 with India playing their opening match vs Bangladesh in Dubai on February 20. The large section of Bangladeshis residing here are excited to see their heroes in action and sound very optimistic on their chances too. The only question on their lips is ""when will the Bangladesh team land?"" and they certainly sound confident of taking a Jasprit Bumrah-less India down in their tournament opener.""I support Bangladesh and want them to win. It will be difficult but easier than before because Jasprit Bumrah , the dangerman, is not here. And we have good pacers. So it will not be an easy game for India as pacers do well in Dubai,"" said a cab driver who makes multiple trips to the airport in a day.""Pakistan is 50-50. They can do anything on their day but when it's not their day, they are a difficult team to even watch on TV (laughs),"" he added on the hosts' chances.Pakistan, the defending champions, will put their credentials to the test in the opener against New Zealand in Karachi.Rohit Sharma (Captain), Shubman Gill (Vice-captain), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohd.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals ' dramatic last-ball victory over Mumbai Indians in the Women's Premier League was marred by two contentious run-out decisions, sparking debate among fans and experts.Arundhati Reddy sealed a tense two-wicket win by scrambling a two off the final delivery, but the focus remained on the two third-umpire calls that left many questioning the interpretation of the rules.With 25 runs needed from 15 deliveries, Shikha Pandey attempted a risky bye after missing a shot but was sent back by non-striker Niki Prasad. A direct hit at the striker's end saw Pandey stretching to make her ground, and at the moment the LED stumps lit up, she appeared to be short.However, after a lengthy review, third umpire Gayathri Venugopalan ruled Pandey not out, basing the decision on when the bail was completely removed from the groove rather than when the lights first illuminated.A near-identical incident occurred seven balls later, with Radha Yadav attempting a quick single before being sent back. Despite a desperate dive, replays showed her bat hovering above the crease when the LED lights first flashed. Yet, by the time the bails were fully dislodged, her bat had made contact with the ground. Once again, the third umpire deemed her safe.The decisions left MI captain Harmanpreet Kaur visibly frustrated, as she engaged in discussions with the on-field umpires. To add to Mumbai's woes, Yadav struck a six on the very next ball, significantly easing the chase.According to the WPL playing conditions, both run-outs could have been given out. The rules state: ""Where LED wickets are used, the moment at which the wicket has been put down shall be deemed to be the first frame in which the LED lights are illuminated and subsequent frames show the bail permanently removed from the top of the stumps.""Despite the controversy, Delhi Capitals celebrated a crucial win, but the debate over run-out protocols in the WPL is unlikely to die down anytime soon.",Delhi Capitals beat Mumbai Indians by two wickets in the Women's Premier League.

Indian cricket team lands in Dubai | Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Gautam Gambhir all spotted | Exclusive visuals

NEW DELHI: India skipper Rohit Sharma ’s habit of forgetting things is well known. From misplacing passports and iPads to even forgetting the team's decision at the toss, the star batter has often been the subject of lighthearted banter from teammates and fans.Over the years, several players have shared amusing anecdotes about Rohit's forgetfulness, making it a widely recognised trait in the cricketing world.After Team India arrived in Dubai for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 , starting on February 19, Rohit was spotted stepping off the team bus and chatting with the support staff—seemingly indicating that he had forgotten something yet again.India aim to reclaim the ICC Champions Trophy for the first time since their 2013 triumph under Mahendra Singh Dhoni The Men in Blue will begin their campaign against Bangladesh on February 20 in Dubai, followed by a high-stakes clash against arch-rivals Pakistan on February 23, before rounding off their league stage against New Zealand on March 2.","Rohit Sharma was spotted stepping off the team bus and chatting with support staff.

"'We are cricketers, not actors or superstars': R Ashwin slams celebrity culture in Indian cricket",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/we-are-cricketers-not-actors-or-superstars-r-ashwin-slams-celebrity-culture-in-indian-cricket/articleshow/118280038.cms,"(ANI Photo)

Indian spin legend R Ashwin has called for an end to treating cricketers as demigods, advocating for a more grounded approach in the sport. He emphasised the importance of players remaining relatable to common people while criticising the superstar culture within the team.Ashwin, who has claimed 765 international wickets across formats, believes that achievements by players like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma should be viewed as routine occurrences given their established careers.""It is important to normalise things in Indian cricket. We must not encourage this superstardom and super celebrities within the Indian cricket team,"" Ashwin said on his Hindi YouTube channel, 'Ash Ki Baat'.""We must normalise all these things going forward. We are cricketers. We are not actors or superstars. We are sportspersons, and we must be someone that the common people should resonate with, and can compare themselves with.""Team India's head coach Gautam Gambhir has expressed similar views against the superstar culture. Gambhir, who has played alongside cricket legends, is committed to shifting focus from individual achievements to team efforts.""For example if you are a Rohit Sharma or a Virat Kohli, who have achieved so much. When you hit one more century, it is not just about your achievement anymore. It should be the business as usual, and our goals should be bigger than these achievements.""Ashwin stressed that individual milestones should not overshadow the team's pursuit of winning tournaments for India.The veteran spinner also questioned the selection of five spinners for the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy in Pakistan.""Five spinners in Dubai? I don't know. I think we are one spinner too many if not two,"" he said.""The two left-arm spinners are your best all-rounders alongside Hardik Pandya . So both Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja are going to play. Hardik will also play and Kuldeep will play.""""If you want Varun Chakravarthy in the team, then you will have to make a pacer sit out and use Hardik as your second pacer. Else you will have to drop a spinner to bring in a third seamer,"" Ashwin said.The Tamil Nadu cricketer concluded his remarkable international career with 537 wickets in 106 Tests, 156 wickets in 116 ODIs, and 72 wickets in 65 T20Is. His retirement came unexpectedly after the drawn third Test against Australia in Brisbane.The selectors have included Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Ravindra Jadeja, and Varun Chakravarthy in the final squad for the tournament beginning February 19.",R Ashwin has called for an end to treating cricketers as demigods.

Bagan show their might to Blasters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/bagan-show-their-might-to-blasters/articleshow/118293743.cms,"KOCHI: On Saturday evening, Mohun Bagan Super Giant demonstrated to Kerala Blasters why they are on top of the ISL table. They also proved that superior ball possession and attacking prowess cannot compensate for defensive frailties.Despite Blasters controlling 67% of the possession, Bagan secured a commanding 3-0 victory over the home side at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Kochi, with Jamie MacLaren netting twice (28, 40) and Alberto Rodriguez (66) completing the tally for the visitors.The first 25 minutes of the game were all about Blasters. They mounted one attack after another on the Bagan goal but failed to convert any of their chances into goals. However, the Kolkata giants weathered the storm and scored against the run of play in the 28th minute. Once they found an opening, Bagan knew how to kill the game and did just that.The home side's best chance in the first half came in the 20th minute, but Jesus Jimenez squandered it. A poor backpass inside the box from Bagan's Lalengmawia Ralte was collected by Jimenez. Despite successfully beating the offside trap, the forward's shot sailed high over the crossbar.The architect of Bagan's first goal was Liston Colaco. With a clever move, he outmanoeuvred Luna and delivered the ball from the left to MacLaren inside the box. MacLaren's excellent first touch followed by a powerful left-footed strike thudded into Blasters' net.Bagan nearly doubled their advantage five minutes later as Colaco's curling attempt from the left narrowly missed the target.MacLaren made it 2-0 four minutes before half-time. The sequence began with Vishal Keith's long pass to MacLaren, who cleverly backheeled to Jason Cummings. The UK striker then chipped the ball towards MacLaren, who sprinted past the Blasters' defence and cleverly lobbed it over the advancing Sachin Suresh into the goal. Although MacLaren put the ball in the Blasters' net one more time during first-half stoppage time, the goal was disallowed for offside.Bagan extended the lead in the 66th minute through defender Alberto Rodriguez Martin's strike. Once again, the Blasters defence failed to clear their lines during a set piece. After the initial shot was blocked by the two-man wall, the ball fell before Rodriguez, whose powerful left-footer was enough to beat a diving Sachin Suresh.The defeat has hit Blasters' playoff qualification hopes. They are eighth in the points table with 24 points from 20 matches and trail sixth-placed Mumbai City by seven points. Bagan, having already secured their playoff spot, strengthened their position at the summit with 49 points from 21 matches.","Mohun Bagan beat Kerala Blasters 3-0 at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Kochi.

NEW DELHI: The ATP Delray Beach Open witnessed a pair of upsets on Saturday, as seventh-seeded Miomir Kecmanovic of Serbia and eighth seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina of Spain advanced to the final with hard-fought victories.Kecmanovic, aged 25, overcame a resilient challenge from the third-seeded American, Alex Michelsen, prevailing 7-6(7/3), 6-3. Despite squandering two set points while serving at 6-5 in the opening set, Kecmanovic regained his composure to clinch the tiebreak. In the second set, he fended off both break points faced, securing the win in 90 minutes.This will be Kecmanovic's fifth tour-level final appearance, with his lone title triumph coming at Kitzbuhel in 2020. He had previously finished as the runner-up at the 2023 Delray Beach Open.Meanwhile, Davidovich Fokina, also 25, continued his impressive run by ousting fourth-seeded Italian Matteo Arnaldi in straight sets, 6-4, 6-4.The Spaniard's victory came in 1 hour and 42 minutes, setting up his second ATP final appearance after his debut at the 2022 Monte Carlo Masters, where he was runner-up to Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece.Notably, Davidovich Fokina had earlier ended the title defence hopes of world number four Taylor Fritz , denying the American a third consecutive Delray Beach crown.Both players will now vie for the prestigious Delray Beach Open title, with Kecmanovic seeking to add to his solitary ATP triumph and Davidovich Fokina aiming for his maiden tour-level championship.","Miomir Kecmanovic and Alejandro Davidovich Fokina advance to the final of the Delray Beach Open.

BHUBANESWAR: It was a mixed day for the Indian teams as the FIH Pro League got underway at Kalinga Stadium here on Saturday. Thanks to a good show from penalty corners, the women's team beat England 3-2. However, later in the day, the men's team went down to Spain 1-3.It was the first time that the two teams faced off following their clash in the bronze-medal match at the Olympics and Spain came out on top this time thanks to goals from Borja Lacalle (28'), Ignacio Cobos (38') and Bruno Avila (56').For India, Sukhjeet Singh scored the opener in the 25th minute after a good play by Jarmanpreet Singh down the right but in the end, India failed to continue with the momentum and take their chances.After the game, coach Craig Fulton looked expectedly disappointed but sounded hopeful about the remaining matches.""I think the rhythm of playing matches is a little different for us, so we have to get back on it and play consistently. The first and second quarters were okay and the third and fourth weren't good enough. But it's the first game of many, so we need to just pick it up, have a look at where we need to improve, and come back strong tomorrow (Sunday),"" said the India coachEarlier in the day, the Indian women's team went on the offensive from the word go and thanks to a powerful pass from the left flank by Sunelita Toppo, they won their first PC of the match.Manisha Chauhan's shot was blocked by the runner, but Sushila Chanu collected the rebound and played it towards the goal where Vaishnavi Vitthal Phalke deflected it into the left bottom corner in the sixth minute.However, six minutes later England equalised through Darcy Bourne.But India once again struck from the PC towards the end of the second quarter. It was their second of the evening and Deepika put it into the bottom right corner. England goalkeeper Miriam Pritchard tried to keep it out with her left leg, but the shot had too much power and it went past the goalkeeper and defenders.India had their chance to increase the lead after that, but they failed to convert them, and England crawled back into the game with a goal from Fiona Crackles in the 58th minute.But India were in no mood to give up and they had the last laugh as Navneet, who missed a sitter earlier in the match, sounded the board from the edge of the D in the 59th minute.It was a perfect start to their tournament after a disastrous showing last season and coach Harendra Singh was more than pleased with what he saw.""I think we started very well, and we had a good structure.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Sanheim Steps In for Team Canada

The Vegas Golden Knights are facing a setback as star defenseman Shea Theodore has been ruled week-to-week with an upper-body injury sustained while representing Team Canada at the 4 Nations Face-Off. The injury occurred during Canada’s 4-3 overtime win against Sweden on Wednesday.Team Canada’s head coach, Jon Cooper, confirmed that Theodore will miss the remainder of the tournament, which wraps up next Thursday. Cooper, however, kept the specifics of the injury under wraps.Cooper said emotionally.Theodore suffered an apparent injury to his right wrist or forearm after a collision with Sweden’s Adrian Kempe in the second period. The hit sent Theodore hard into the glass. He was seen in visible pain on the bench before heading down the tunnel for X-rays.Kempe seemed unaware of the severity of the hit, statingTheodore, 29, has been a key player for the Golden Knights this season, racking up:With his seven-year contract extension set to begin next season at a $7.43 million cap hit, Theodore remains a vital piece of the Golden Knights' defense.In Theodore’s absence, Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Travis Sanheim will step into the lineup. Sanheim and Sam Bennett were healthy scratches against Sweden, but now Sanheim is getting his shot on the blue line.However, Team Canada is limited in making further roster adjustments. According to TSN’s Chris Johnston, Canada cannot add any new players unless another defenseman is injured. They can only notify a player to be on standby.With Theodore out, all eyes are on Sanheim to help Canada maintain its momentum as the tournament heads toward the final. Meanwhile, the Golden Knights will be keeping a close watch on Theodore’s recovery, hoping their star defenseman returns to the ice soon.",Vegas Golden Knights defenseman Shea Theodore has been ruled week-to-week with an upper-body injury.
