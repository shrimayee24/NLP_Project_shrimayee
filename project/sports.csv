Despite having a newborn son he had not yet met, Singh and his team immediately mobilised.By the morning of Nov 27, they were in Mumbai. From there, an NSG squadron, including Singh's team, was deployed by helicopter to key locations like Nariman Point and the besieged Taj Hotel. After days of intense combat, they successfully rescued hostages and neutralised the terrorists.Recounting the harrowing events, Singh shared his profound commitment: ""My son was born on Nov 22, 2008. I hadn't even seen him, but I went to protect our country from terrorists,"" he told TOI.At the Taj Hotel, where they were dropped off to begin their rescue mission, Singh and his team tirelessly evacuated civilians.

On the fourth floor, we neutralised one of the terrorists during a search.""While searching the second floor, Singh faced a grenade attack. In a split second, he leapt from the second floor and took cover inside a nearby bar. Though injured, he continued to engage the terrorists for approximately 90 minutes, even contemplating a suicidal grenade attack. ""I knew I could also die, but I didn't care about my life,"" he remembered.Before he could act on this, fellow NSG commandos breached the walls to extract him.

This alerted my team to the close-quarters fight,"" he said.Singh and his team successfully neutralised four terrorists. However, Singh suffered severe injuries. ""I was shot in both my legs, and I have splinter marks all over my body.

Wayne Gretzky's attendance sparks unrelated controversy



Alex Ovechkin Breaks Gretzky's Record for Most Goals in NHL History üö®

Wayne Gretzky faces backlash over Kash Patel appearance



Alex Ovechkin etched his name into NHL history, scoring his 895th goal to surpass Wayne Gretzky ‚Äôs all-time record. But what should‚Äôve been a celebration of hockey greatness took an unexpected turn. The spotlight drifted from the ice to the stands, specifically to Gretzky‚Äôs guest, Kash Patel . The former government official‚Äôs appearance sparked a wave of political chatter, clouding what was meant to be a milestone moment in the sport.Here‚Äôs what happened: Gretzky, invited to witness Ovechkin‚Äôs history-making night, was spotted at recent Capitals games alongside Patel, a former U.S. government official with Republican ties. That detail, insignificant to some, became headline fodder across social media.Suddenly, instead of reflecting on the end of one era and the start of another, online chatter shifted to whether Gretzky‚Äôs presence next to Patel carried political weight. Some fans, particularly from Canada, voiced disappointment, questioning Gretzky‚Äôs silence on past political issues and reading into his choice of company.Frank Seravalli, a respected NHL insider, thought so. He was quick to dismiss the controversy, reminding fans that Patel isn‚Äôt some outsider looking for a photo op‚Äîhe‚Äôs a longtime hockey guy with actual time on the ice. According to Seravalli, dragging Gretzky into a political debate during a celebratory hockey moment is a misfire.Let‚Äôs not forget what actually happened on the ice. Ovechkin scored a power-play goal in the second period against the Islanders, a goal that not only broke Gretzky‚Äôs record but redefined the ceiling for future scorers.Gretzky handled the moment with quiet grace. He didn‚Äôt make it about himself. He didn‚Äôt push a narrative. He showed up, clapped, and passed the torch with a short message that was more personal than political. ‚ÄúI know how hard it is to get to 895,‚Äù he said, reflecting on his own kids being close in age to Ovechkin‚Äôs when he set the record.Also Read: Alex Ovechkin‚Äôs record ignites nostalgia as Penguins‚Äô Mike Sullivan remembers legends who built NHL It was hockey history in real time.

Steelers‚Äô pursuit of Aaron Rodgers faces mystery roadblock as new doubts surface



Could Aaron Rodgers make Steelers decision at Pat McAfee event? | Pro Football Talk | NFL on NBC

Aaron Rodgers remains the centerpiece of the Pittsburgh Steelers ' offseason headlines, but the veteran quarterback has yet to offer any clarity about his next move. Many anticipated that his long-awaited decision might be revealed during Pat McAfee's highly anticipated 'Big Night Aht' at PPG Paints Arena, but that moment came and went without any announcement. As of now, the Steelers are still in suspense ‚Äî and that may remain the case until after the 2025 NFL Draft.The uncertainty surrounding Aaron Rodgers‚Äô potential arrival in Pittsburgh is now believed to be more strategic than financial. In a recent interview with 93.7 The Fan, Pro Football Talk's Mike Florio addressed the core of the delay, stating, ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs the bigger issue,‚Äù when asked about the Steelers' draft plans potentially affecting Rodgers‚Äô decision. Florio further added, ""And it goes more like this: what if we determine halfway through the season that this just isn‚Äôt a year for the Steelers to do anything significant? OK, let‚Äôs find out what the young guy has... So I think you introduce a potential awkwardness. I don‚Äôt think he wants to go into a situation where there‚Äôs going to be a chance.""This echoes a scenario that played out recently with another veteran quarterback ‚Äî Kirk Cousins. The Atlanta Falcons handed Cousins a $180 million contract, only to draft Michael Penix Jr. with the eighth overall pick the very same offseason. That move left Cousins as a highly paid backup while Penix took the spotlight as the team‚Äôs future. Rodgers, known for being deliberate and cautious about his decisions, appears unwilling to walk into a similar situation.Pittsburgh has been actively scouting quarterback prospects, including Colorado‚Äôs Shedeur Sanders and Ole Miss‚Äôs Jaxson Dart during recent pre-draft visits. This signals that the team is eyeing long-term solutions at quarterback ‚Äî and might be ready to draft one in the first round.Still, the Steelers' interest in drafting a quarterback doesn't necessarily signal a lack of desire for Rodgers. In fact, the organization envisions a mentorship dynamic where a young quarterback can develop under Rodgers‚Äô guidance. It‚Äôs a model that could serve Pittsburgh both in the present and in the future.For now, the Steelers ‚Äî and the NFL world ‚Äî continue to wait. Whether Aaron Rodgers dons black and gold or chooses another path, his next chapter remains one of the most intriguing storylines heading into the draft and beyond.Also Read: Steelers fans hoping for Aaron Rodgers news just got a reality check from Pat McAfee","Aaron Rodgers remains the centerpiece of the Pittsburgh Steelers'offseason headlines.

A goal for the ages: Alex Ovechkin breaks Wayne Gretzky's 26-year record



FULL Alex Ovechkin Celebration Ceremony After Record-Breaking Goal No. 895

A legacy passed down: Anastasia Shubskaya receives diamond tribute from Janet Gretzky



After Alex Ovechkin netted his 895th career goal and broke legendary Wayne Gretzky 's record, Janet Gretzky showed respect to a time-honored hockey tradition by gifting Anastasia Shubskaya , wife of Alex Ovechkin, an eight-carat diamond ring that had been estimated at $280,000. The Capitals may have lost to the New York Islanders by a score of 4-1, but the outcome was an afterthought to a night all about legacy, love, and a new chapter in hockey's history.The moment of history arrived at 7:26 of the second period. Alex Ovechkin let go of a blazing shot through fellow Russian Ilya Sorokin, making himself the NHL's all-time leading goal scorer. Fans inside UBS Arena lost their minds, and Alex Ovechkin commemorated the occasion by executing a belly flop onto the ice‚Äîcelebrating his big achievement.While Alex Ovechkin was absorbing the enormity of his achievement, Anastasia Shubskaya was gifted a symbolic token of the historic night. Continuing a tradition started in 1994, when Colleen Howe (wife of Gordie Howe) gave Janet Gretzky a diamond ring after her husband, Wayne Gretzky, broke Colleen Howe‚Äôs husband‚Äôs record, Janet Gretzky ensured history repeated itself‚Äîthis time from one hockey family to another.In an interview with the media, Wayne Gretzky said, ‚ÄúA month ago, my wife said, ‚ÄòYou know, Colleen Howe started a tradition. I‚Äôm not sure if anyone is going to break Alex‚Äôs record, but I want to give her (Ovechkin‚Äôs wife, Anastasia Shubskaya) something really unique.‚Äô So, we went out and she picked out an eight-diamond ring for Alex‚Äôs wife. Not only do hockey guys pass down traditions. So do the families and wives.‚ÄùThe act not only spanned generations of greatness but also underlined the strong relationship between hockey families across generations.Anastasia Shubskaya, who tied the knot with Alex Ovechkin in 2016, is a Russian model who has appeared in numerous Russian magazines during her career and has built a strong social media presence. They are proud parents of two sons- Sergei and Ilya.Also read: ‚ÄúNow the real stuff is coming‚Äù: Alex Ovechkin skips The Tonight Show appearance to stay playoff-ready Even though the Capitals fell on the evening, the larger context is one of hope.

Poet struggles to serve Taylor Swift amid tight security and elusive whereabouts

Second legal attempt hits the same wall as the first

A copyright infringement case involving global music icon Taylor Swift has reportedly hit yet another snag, as the plaintiff, Florida-based poet Kimberly Marasco , claims she‚Äôs once again unable to serve Swift with legal papers.According to Newsweek, Kimberly Marasco alleges she is facing ‚Äúextreme difficulties‚Äù in locating Taylor Swift, who has been notably low-key in recent months, reportedly spending time with her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce . The two have largely stayed out of the spotlight since Kelce‚Äôs Super Bowl LIX victory in February.Marasco‚Äôs lawsuit accuses Swift, her collaborators Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner, as well as Universal Music Group and Republic Records, of allegedly copying the poet‚Äôs written work across several of Swift‚Äôs most popular albums‚ÄîLover, Folklore, Midnights , and The Tortured Poets Department. The plaintiff is seeking over $30 million in damages.However, progress in the case has been delayed due to Marasco‚Äôs inability to serve Swift with official court documents‚Äîa step that must be completed before the case can proceed. The singer‚Äôs high-profile lifestyle, coupled with strong personal security and the use of trusts to hold her properties, has made tracking her location a significant challenge for the plaintiff.This is not Marasco‚Äôs first attempt to sue the 14-time Grammy Award winner. Her previous case was dismissed after she failed to serve Swift within the legally required timeframe. Now, in her second try, she‚Äôs reportedly seeking clarification from federal judge Aileen Cannon on whether all the defendants must wait to respond until Swift has been served.So far, Judge Cannon has held that no party should respond to the lawsuit until every named defendant has been officially served. That directive leaves the case in limbo, with no forward movement until Swift receives the papers.Swift has not issued a public statement about the lawsuit. Her legal team has previously prevailed in a similar high-profile case concerning her song ‚ÄúShake It Off,‚Äù where she faced, and ultimately overcame, copyright infringement claims.Also Read: Did Taylor Swift really forgive Blake Lively after being dragged into the explosive $400M lawsuit scandal?

With Taylor now in a high-profile relationship with NFL star Travis Kelce, the timing and tone of Sheeran's comments have sparked chatter on social media.Looking back on his early days of touring with Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran painted a vivid picture of closeness. ‚ÄúI literally spent almost every single day with her for about six months,‚Äù he said, referring to the time he spent as the opening act on Swift‚Äôs Red tour. ‚ÄúI lived in Nashville, and she lived in Nashville, and we used to fly to and from the gigs together.‚ÄùThat period, according to Sheeran, left a lasting impact on him. He admitted to revisiting old text messages and voice notes from that time, describing a sense of deep nostalgia. ‚ÄúI think that period of time, I do, you know, I see her when I see her,‚Äù he said, adding that while they‚Äôre not as constantly in touch now, the bond is still intact.Even with their hectic careers, Sheeran noted that he and Swift make time for meaningful catch-ups. ‚ÄúI probably see her like four times a year and we do what I said, like proper sit-down, six-hour catch-ups,‚Äù he revealed. The two recently reunited during Swift‚Äôs Eras Tour at Wembley Stadium in August 2024, where they performed their hit Everything Has Changed ‚Äî a nostalgic nod to their earlier collaboration on the Red album.While there‚Äôs no evidence of tension between Sheeran and Kelce, some fans have raised eyebrows over the emotional tone of Sheeran‚Äôs memories. With his emphasis on the ‚Äúinseparable‚Äù connection they once shared, speculation has naturally followed about how Kelce might feel about the close bond.

Why Aaron Rodgers‚Äô weekly appearances are raising eyebrows in sports media ‚Äî Has Pat McAfee given him too much power?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-aaron-rodgers-weekly-appearances-are-raising-eyebrows-in-sports-media-has-pat-mcafee-given-him-too-much-power/articleshow/120163670.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

Aaron Rodgers‚Äô influence may be changing the tone and focus of The Pat McAfee Show

When Pat McAfee welcomed Aaron Rodgers onto The Pat McAfee Show as a regular guest, it was a ratings jackpot. Rodgers, a future Hall of Fame quarterback known for his strong opinions and unpredictable commentary, brought a mix of authenticity, controversy, and star power to the show. But as time has gone on, fans and critics alike have begun asking: has McAfee given Rodgers too much influence on the show and its direction?Pat McAfee‚Äôs rise in sports media has been fueled by his unapologetically unfiltered style and close connections with big-name athletes. His willingness to give Aaron Rodgers a space to speak freely was initially praised as groundbreaking. But as Rodgers continues to use the platform to make bold statements‚Äîranging from vaccine skepticism to conspiracy theories‚Äîsome argue the balance has shifted.Rather than challenging Rodgers, McAfee often appears to agree or laugh off controversial remarks, which has led to criticism that the show enables rather than questions. What started as an entertaining segment has morphed into something larger‚Äîan unmoderated soapbox for one of the NFL‚Äôs most polarizing figures.There‚Äôs also the question of whether Rodgers' influence has shifted the show's broader identity. McAfee built his brand on humor, relatability, and insight into the sports world. However, the increasing focus on Rodgers' worldview‚Äîoften far removed from football‚Äîhas left some longtime viewers feeling alienated.Rodgers doesn‚Äôt just make headlines when he‚Äôs on the show‚Äîhe is the headline.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals continued their unbeaten run in IPL 2025 with a dominant six-wicket win over Royal Challengers Bengaluru on Thursday at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Match 24 of the tournament.After being asked to bat first, RCB posted a below-par 163/7 in their 20 overs.Despite a brisk start from Phil Salt (37 off 17), RCB lost momentum following quick dismissals of Padikkal (1) and Virat Kohli (22).Captain Rajat Patidar (25) and Tim David (37 not out off 20) offered some resistance, but the Capitals‚Äô bowlers maintained control.Young leggie Vipraj Nigam impressed with figures of 2/18, while Kuldeep Yadav also chipped in with two crucial wickets while leaking only 17 runs in the middle overs.In reply, DC were rocked early, slipping to 30/3 within five overs as Bhuvneshwar Kumar struck twice in quick succession.However, a counter-attacking knock from KL Rahul (93 not off 53 balls) turned the tide.Rahul was in sublime touch, anchoring the innings with elegance and aggression, supported well by Tristan Stubbs (38 not out off 23), as the pair stitched together an unbeaten 111-run stand.RCB bowlers failed to capitalise after the early breakthroughs, with Hazlewood and Yash Dayal proving expensive.Suyash Sharma briefly offered hope with Axar Patel‚Äôs wicket, but Rahul‚Äôs calculated onslaught ensured Delhi cruised to victory with 13 balls to spare.With this win, Delhi Capitals, currently second on the table, solidify their playoff hopes, remaining unbeaten in the tournament so far.For RCB, it's back to the drawing board as they struggle with consistency in both departments.","Delhi Capitals continued their unbeaten run in IPL 2025 with a dominant six- wicket win over Royal Challengers Bengaluru.

Astrologer Predicts: Will Hardik Pandya & Mumbai Indians work out?

NEW DELHI: The crowd at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium kept roaring and cheering, even as Royal Challengers Bengaluru faced defeat against Delhi Capitals . The reason? Their hometown hero KL Rahul was putting on a show at his home ground. Rahul lit up the evening with his elegant strokeplay, thrilling the fans with towering hits across the park. When he sealed the win by launching Yash Dayal over the long leg boundary and celebrated with a chest thump, the stadium erupted ‚Äî a heartfelt ovation for their very own local lad.KL Rahul produced a batting masterclass on Thursday to lead Delhi Capitals to a convincing six-wicket win over Royal Challengers Bengaluru. Chasing a tricky 164 on a two-paced surface, Rahul stood tall amid early chaos, anchoring the innings with a sublime unbeaten 93 off just 53 balls, laced with nine fours and five sixes.Rahul‚Äôs calm amidst the storm came after Delhi‚Äôs top order collapsed to 30 for 3 in the fifth over. But the wicketkeeper-batter kept his composure, stitched crucial partnerships with Axar Patel (15) and later Tristan Stubbs (38* off 23), and saw the chase through with 13 balls to spare.With this win, Delhi Capitals extended their unbeaten run to four matches, firmly holding onto second place on the points table, just behind Gujarat Titans.Earlier, RCB posted a below-par 163 for 7 after electing to bat, a total that never truly looked threatening once the Delhi spinners got into rhythm.Phil Salt gave the hosts a blazing start with a 17-ball 37, taking Mitchell Starc for 30 runs in one over, and helping RCB reach 61 by the end of the fourth over. But once Salt was run out in a mix-up with Kohli, the innings spiraled downward.Vipraj Nigam turned the game on its head with his leg-spin, first dismissing the dangerous Kohli for 22 and then removing Krunal Pandya later in the innings. His spell of 2 for 18 in four overs was instrumental in derailing the RCB charge. Kuldeep Yadav also chipped in with his guile, picking up two crucial wickets ‚Äî Rajat Patidar (25) and Jitesh Sharma (3) ‚Äî to ensure the middle order couldn‚Äôt capitalise on the platform.Despite a few powerful late hits from Tim David, who remained unbeaten on 37 off 20 balls, RCB‚Äôs total lacked the punch needed to challenge Delhi‚Äôs deep batting unit.However, Delhi didn‚Äôt have the smoothest of starts.Faf du Plessis was out for 2, Fraser-McGurk fell for 7, and Porel followed soon after, leaving the visitors reeling. But KL Rahul played the perfect anchor, absorbing the pressure and gradually shifting gears. His six off Livingstone over midwicket and a glorious straight drive off Hazlewood were just glimpses of his dominance.After Axar fell trying to force the pace, Stubbs joined Rahul and ensured there were no further hiccups. The duo added 111 runs for the unbroken sixth wicket stand and finished things off in style ‚Äî KL rahul sealing the match with a six in the 18th over.","KL Rahul produced a batting masterclass to lead Delhi Capitals to a convincing six-wicket win over Royal Challengers Bengaluru.

Will Marcell Ozuna play tonight or rest again?

Atlanta Braves fans eagerly wait for updates regarding their favorite players, and Marcell Ozuna is one of them. All the fans are curious to know will Marcell Ozuna will play tonight when the Atlanta Braves take on the Philadelphia Phillies at Truist Park at 7:15 pm ET. Marcell Ozuna is the best hitter for the team, and his absence was noticed in the last games. His fans are hoping he will return but so far have received no word from the Braves if they plan to play or not tonight.During a match with the Arizona Diamondbacks, Marcell Ozuna got his right hamstring tightened up. This followed after attempting to leg out a ground ball and being unable to reach first base. The team immediately had him leave the game and be ""day-to-day.""Although the injury does not appear to be that bad, hamstring problems can worsen if they are not handled delicately. The Braves would not give him a return timetable. They simply stated that Marcell Ozuna is being evaluated by the medical staff and that they will watch him daily.Marcell Ozuna has gotten off to a fantastic start in the 2025 season. He already had 3 home runs on his resume and has been one of the Braves' best producers in the lineup. His ability to hit home runs is a plus for the team, particularly in this type of clutch game against the Phillies.Till now, there are no official reports on whether Marcell Ozuna will be included in the lineup today. He was spotted doing light exercise during practice, which denotes he is healthy, and it is a positive sign, but it does not necessarily guarantee that he will play. The Braves might opt to rest him for one more day to ensure he is fine.With the season up to this point long, the Braves don't want to risk losing him to a more serious illness. Marcell Ozuna will likely be back shortly, but whether tonight or eventually will depend on how he is feeling and what the doctors advise.Fans will be eagerly waiting for the official lineup announcement closer to game time in Truist Park. Ozuna has been a key piece of the Braves' offense this season, and his presence in the lineup provides both power and experience. However, the team‚Äôs cautious approach highlights their long-term focus, prioritizing player health over short-term gains. If Ozuna does sit out tonight, expect the Braves to rely on their bench depth to fill the gap in the batting order.Also Read: ""I Made A Mistake"": When Marcelll Ozuna Apologized For Domestic Violence Controversy","Atlanta Braves star Marcell Ozuna got his right hamstring tightened up during a match with the Arizona Diamondbacks.

The focus was on Matthew Knies as the perfect moment in the first career NHL hat trick pushed the Maple Leafs further ahead in an Atlantic Division race while sending a strong exit with four more games left in the regular season.Matthew Knies, a Toronto rookie, is brilliant and poured on a hat trick with the game-winner in overtime. An excellent pass from Auston Matthews found Knies at the backdoor, where he calmly deposited it into an empty net. His confidence and his awareness on the ice are constantly improving, with teammates and fans beginning to notice his growing influence.Hence, the pillars of the Leafs' offense, Mitch Marner and Auston Matthews, led Thursday's victory. Marner opened the scoring early in the contest and then had two assists; Matthews, adorned with the 'C' of captain, assisted on three goals ‚Äî one being the series-clinching goal scored in OT. Team Leafs had a very obvious chemistry with one another in transition and in tight-scoring areas.Even with the victory, Toronto faced some push-back from the Lightning. After getting out to a 2-0 lead, they let Tampa Bay back into the game with goals from Nick Perbix, Oliver Bjorkstrand, and Victor Hedman. Yet, Anthony Stolarz's shining moments between the pipes- especially the mighty breakaway save in overtime- kept the Leafs in firm control.The comeback merely demonstrates the spirit possessed by the whole Three Point Lightning Division. Hedman's power-break shot tied the game in the third period, but defensive lapses at the start brutally punished his team. Coach Cooper recognized the sluggish start of his troops as a charge for the loss but fought very hard for the rest of the game.Also Read: NHL Rumors: Toronto Maple Leafs‚Äô budding star Matthew Knies now looming large at $9 million AAV in negotiations The Toronto Maple Leafs were able not only to clinch two points from their overtime victory, but they also sent a clear message to all that they are ready for the postseason.

UFC 314: Pre-Fight Press Conference

Seems like Bryce Mitchell and Jean Silva were not the only show-stealers at thepress conference on April 10, 2025. While the crowd and viewers were anticipating an ugly brawl between the two fighters because of their recent war of words, it was two other fighters who were almost on the edge of getting physical after a two-way rundown of words at each other. First-time title contenderand featherweight contenderhad an ugly exchange of words in Spanish to the extent that the translator was also left speechless. The brawl might just have established another potential fight forto confirm for any upcoming showdown.The bitterness between the two fighters broke out when Diego Lopes was asked about a previously made comment by Yair Rodriguez on the nationality being represented by the fighters. On the media day held on April 9, 2025, Rodriguez was asked how he felt about the online trolls being directed towards Lopes for the latter being originally from Brazil and now staying and training in Mexico. Rodriguez did put out a calculated reply.‚ÄúI‚Äôve been living in the U.S. for over 10 years, my girlfriend is American, and I speak English‚Äîand now, because of that, I‚Äôm representing the American flag to gain followers. I love this country, but I‚Äôm not going to say I‚Äôm American. I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm Mexican, and I‚Äôm proud of it. Yes, I have a problem with that, not with Diego‚Ä¶My issue is, what‚Äôs up with people?...I just don‚Äôt agree with it.‚ÄùDuring the UFC 314 press conference, Lopes was asked if he had anything to say about it, to which he replied, ‚ÄúI will tell you what, man, I am very grateful to Mexico. It‚Äôs not our stories. Our life stories are completely different. I am so grateful for what Mexico has given me. I represent both countries and if you are gonna talk, you are gonna talk, I don‚Äôt care.‚ÄùPreviously, Lopes had once mentioned that he not only represents Mexico and Brazil but also the entire Latin America. The feud between the two fighters escalated when the Brazilian fighter was asked if, in a situation where both Lopes and Rodriguez win their respective bouts, will they be facing each other at Guadalajara this year. Lopes took up the opportunity and taunted Rodriguez for his recent two-match losing skid by asking the questioner about it.This was the point where the ugliness broke out as El Pantera lashed out with a curse word in Spanish that translates to ‚Äúp**sy‚Äù. The brawl erupted instantly, as both fighters had to be separated by the security.The occasional translation during the brawl revealed the fighters talking about their respective teams and threats thrown at each other. If the bout ever materialises in Guadalajara, fans might be in for another high-octane bout between the two fighters.Also read: ‚ÄúMy visualization goes towards that‚Äù‚Äî Former interim featherweight champion teases his future plan ahead of UFC 314 This recent incident might just bring in another announcement from Dana White‚Äôs team, after the careful assessment of UFC 314 results.

After hitting the winning run against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), Delhi Capitals batter KL Rahul dug his bat into the ground like a sword, marked his territory, pointed to his badge and said ""Ye mera ground hai (This is my ground).""""This is my ground, my home, know this (ground) better than anyone else,"" he said at the post-match presentation.On Thursday night, KL Rahul scored a measured 93 not out to guide Delhi Capitals to a six-wicket win against Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium . Chasing a modest 164, Delhi Capitals stuttered at the start but Rahul's composed knock from 53 balls with six sixes and seven fours did the job for his side.Rahul's innings was a prime example of risk management as he started at a slower tempo before shifting the gears seamlessly.""It was a slightly tricky wicket but what helped me was being behind the stumps for 20 overs, watching how the wicket played. The ball sat in the wicket but it was consistent throughout, it was one-paced.""I knew what my shots are, wanted to get off to a good start, and then assess it accordingly. It depends on the conditions and the ground and the dimensions. On a wicket like this, I knew what my pockets were.""If I wanted to hit a big six, I knew what pockets to target, and keeping gave me a feeler for where other batters were dismissed and where they hit the sixes. Got lucky with the dropped catch.""Rahul acknowledged it was a tricky pitch but he always experiment during the practice.""Something I have always done with my preparation is that I always try to adapt to different wickets (even in practice).""I experiment in practice, get out a couple of times but it gives me a fair idea of the areas I can target - where I can take singles, where I can hit sixes.""I don't keep batting for hours and hours and keep slogging. I do that sometimes but that is when I am not getting into a flow and rhythm. It is more about how I can master playing (on a particular pitch) and that becomes second-nature.""Delhi Capitals are unbeaten in the tournament and are currently placed at top of the points table.","KL Rahul scored 93 not out to guide Delhi Capitals to a six-wicket win against Royal Challengers Bengaluru.

Are CSK making the best use of Jadeja?

CHENNAI: There was much drama in the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) camp on the eve of their must-win game against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). Ruturaj Gaikwad , who was hit by a Tushar Deshpande delivery in the game against Rajasthan Royals in Guwahati last week, appears to have a broken elbow.‚ÄúRuturaj has been ruled out of the rest of the IPL with a broken elbow. And now a certain uncapped player called MS Dhoni will lead us,‚Äù coach Stephen Fleming said.Gaikwad hasn‚Äôt been at his best and it will be interesting to see if CSK go back to senior player Rahul Tripathi at the top of the order or throw in one of the rookies ‚Äî Shaikh Rashid or Andre Siddarth ‚Äî into the deep end.Asked whether it was difficult to make Dhoni take up the captaincy again, Fleming said, ‚ÄúNo, he understood the situation. Ruturaj didn‚Äôt want to go but it‚Äôs an unfortunate situation.‚ÄùThe injury complicates an already complicated situation for CSK, who have only one win out of five. Another loss here on Friday may just make the uphill road to playoffs qualification all the more difficult. But then, their opponents KKR aren‚Äôt exactly better off either.The defending champions have won only two of their five matches and it‚Äôs extremely important that they take full points here. There‚Äôs one thing, though, that may just help the Knight Riders at the MA Chidambaram Stadium ‚Äî the pitch. They have complained a lot about their home pitch at the Eden, but here, their spinners might get the purchase they are looking for.For a long time, one of the centrepieces of Chennai Super Kings‚Äô success has been Ravindra Jadeja. It was his consistency over the years that made CSK shell out Rs 18 cr to retain him. However, in the five games that CSK have played so far, it seems that their former captain has been underutilised to a degree.In none of the games did the experienced left-arm spinner get his full quota of four overs. In 13 of the 20 available overs that he bowled, Jadeja gave away 105 runs, going at an economy rate of 8.‚ÄúWe have six options. It‚Äôs not a set stage for anybody, we try to go according to the situation,‚Äù coach Fleming said on Thursday.Meanwhile, as a batter too, Jadeja has been limited to the role of a finisher at a time when the top order has struggled.‚ÄúWe really like his partnership with MS at the back end. That appeals to us,‚Äù Fleming said.",Ruturaj Gaikwad has been ruled out of the rest of the IPL with a broken elbow. MS Dhoni will lead the Chennai Super Kings against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) CSK have won only two of their five matches.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120188531,imgsize-77758,width-400,resizemode-4/Dhoni-Fleming.jpg"

'It‚Äôs a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee ‚Äî Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match ‚Äî before the Nagpur ODI ‚Äî more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‚ÄòHitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Braves manager Ben Snitker says cannot rush for Ronald Acuna Jr‚Äôs surgery

""They just have to check him out and sign off on it before they can do that, And I think this was just part of the plan initially. I don't think he's going to rush it or anything. This has been the case from the get go.""

""It's going to be about, just like other guys that miss spring training, getting his body in shape when he gets cleared,"" Snitker said.

MLB legend John Smoltz praises Atlanta Braves‚Äô lineup

""Look, if Acuna comes back and does his thing ‚Äî the flash, the flair and everything ‚Äî then they're a different ballclub, They just play different. I mean, he brings excitement at the top of the lineup, but it's going to take him a minute. You know, it's his second ACL.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, they love Marcel Ozuna and what he brings every single day to the plate offensively, Obviously, he's just playing the DH role. Albies is a guy that has high energy, a smile, and enjoys the game, and Austin Riley's been there, done that.""

Atlanta Braves Struggles, ABS System & Slow Starts With John Smoltz

""So I think the biggest thing for the Braves is they do not get too high or too low ‚Äî they really don't. They‚Äôve proven that in their track record under Brian Snitker, and that's a credit to his managing style. But I just think those three guys I mentioned are a unique blend.‚Äù

Amid a heated baseball season, Atlanta Braves‚Äô outfielder Ronald Acuna Jr. , who is still recovering from a serious knee injury , might have to get his knee medically checked. He had surgery last year. Meanwhile, MLB legend John Smoltz praised the Atlanta Braves ' lineup this season.It was a difficult period in Ronald Acuna Jr‚Äôs life, since he tore his left ACL in May and had to undergo a surgery in June. While Acuna says he‚Äôs able to hit during practice, he, however, hasn‚Äôt been allowed to run or make quick moves. Media reports suggest that now, Los Angeles based doctors will have to do yet another round of medical checks to understand his injuries‚Äô progress. This could put the Atlanta Braves in a spot, if they miss out on a key player, however, the team will also be prioritising their player‚Äôs health.Atlanta Braves‚Äô manager Brian Snitker said that Acuna is not allowed to do any kind of full-speed running or quick direction changes. He said that the Atlanta Braves are super careful with Acuna‚Äôs medical injury, and for the recovery to be seamless, they are making sure Acuna heals quickly and properly, before he makes a solid return to the field.Regarding the current situation, Snitker said:Snitker further added and said:However, MLB legend and pitcher John Smoltz offered some insight into how great of a plager Ronald Acuna Jr was. While speaking on Ben Verlander‚Äôs ‚ÄòFlippin Bats‚Äô podcast, Smoltz explained that Acuna‚Äôs return could be a game changer for the Braves. He said Acuna could make the game more exciting, provided he returns quickly, post his injury recovery.Smoltz said:Further, Smoltz explained that Marcel Ozuna is also a brilliant outfielder, while Ozzie Albies has good energy that he brings to the field.

NBA fans react to Ja Morant‚Äôs new celebration



Ja Morant is unstoppable. The Memphis Grizzlies star debuted a new 3-point celebration during the team's recent wins, drawing attention from fans, the NBA, and even the Inside the NBA crew, including Charles Barkley . Following a $75,000 fine for using hand gestures interpreted as gun-related, Morant took a creative turn with a fresh celebration that mimics tossing a grenade and covering his ears as the crowd shouts ""boom.""The gesture was first seen during the Memphis Grizzlies‚Äô dominant 124-100 win over the Charlotte Hornets on Tuesday, where Ja Morant racked up 28 points, eight assists, and five rebounds in a near double-double effort. The celebration instantly drew reactions across social media and sports media platforms. On Thursday, Morant repeated the move at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves at FedExForum, and the Memphis crowd was fully on board.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my celebration now until somebody else got a problem with it, and I‚Äôll find another one,‚Äù Morant said during the team‚Äôs shootaround earlier that day.‚ÄúHe has a history that maybe he should leave the celebrations where people might die alone,‚Äù Kenny Smith said during the Inside the NBA halftime show. Charles Barkley added, ‚ÄúI know one person‚Äôs happy right now‚ÄîTaylor Jenkins ain‚Äôt got to deal with this crap. He‚Äôs going to get another job.‚ÄùInterestingly, the grenade toss appeared shortly after former NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas joked that Morant should use a grenade as a safer alternative to his gun gesture. ‚ÄúBombs Away üòÇü´° Ja Morant hit Charlotte with the Call of Duty Grenade üó£Ô∏èSent them to the ""GULAG"" üíØüòÇ‚Äù Arenas previously posted on X with a video of him jokingly asking Morant to try grenade gesture as a safer alternative.The 24-year-old guard's celebrations have become a storyline of their own this season. After multiple incidents related to firearms and a suspension earlier in the season, the NBA has been keeping a close watch on Morant.Morant‚Äôs wild celebration gets intense fan reactions on social media. While some fans hailed the new gesture, some straightway criticized the move.‚ÄúSo much aura,‚Äù one fan wrote.‚ÄúThis is an elite celebration,‚Äù another wrote.‚ÄúCredit to Ja ts is hard,‚Äù one commented.One fan joked, ‚ÄúThrowing his playoff chances away with that grenade.‚ÄùAnother condemned, ‚ÄúHis team was still down after that, celebrate when you get the lead.‚ÄùAlso Read: GTA 6 rumors swirl around Ja Morant, but it's all unofficial Fans have mixed reactions to the new gesture.

SALT ASSAULT

BENGALURU: After KL Rahul (93 not out; 53b; 7x4; 6x6) scored the winning runs for Delhi Capitals (DC) with a six, he sauntered to the adjoining pitch, drew a circle and thumped his bat on the ground. After all, the M Chinnaswamy Stadium is his home turf, and Rahul simply owned the stage on Thursday night.A flamboyant yet classic batter whose repertoire of strokes runs delightfully deep, Rahul in his backyard is a dangerous proposition, especially if he is dropped by the opposition even before he gets going, as Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) found out the hard way.Rahul, dropped by Rajat Patidar on five, turned match winner in Capitals‚Äô six-wicket victory in a tricky chase of 164, ensuring DC cantered home with 13 balls to spare. Rahul oozed class and composure as he soaked in the pressure of losing early wickets to stitch together a match-winning 111-run (55 balls) fourth-wicket partnership with Tristan Stubbs (38; 23b; 4x4; 1x6).Defending a modest total, RCB‚Äôs bowlers were on the money in the first half of DC‚Äôs chase. The new-ball pair of Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2/26) and Yash Dayal had the crowd on their feet with their swing and testing lengths, sending back openers Faf du Plessis (2), Jake Fraser -McGurk (7) and Abhishek Porel inside the Powerplay.At 58/4 in the ninth over, the visitors had their backs to the wall. Even as the cloudy Bengaluru skies threatened to open up, Rahul stepped on the accelerator in the 15th over, picking the seasoned Josh Hazlewood for a display of delectable drives and magnificent cover drives, as the over yielded 22 runs.From there on, it was just a matter of formality as Rahul and Stubbs ensured a four-match winning streak for the Capitals.There was an aura of invincibility around Phil Salt. The only person who could have stopped the explosive opener was the Englishman himself. All it took was a stumble on the turnaround and a communication lapse and the momentum tilted in DC‚Äôs favour.RCB raced to 61 off 23 deliveries with Salt contributing 37 (17b; 4x4; 3x6). Just when it seemed like the combination of Salt and Virat Kohli (22) had set the tone for a run feast, Salt, after a failed bid for a cheeky single, stumbled and then scrambled to make his crease even as Rahul ‚Äî that man again ‚Äî hit the stumps.Salt‚Äôs dismissal snuffed the impetus as the RCB batting line-up mostly made guest appearances at the crease, crumbling around the lack of pace from spinners and poor shot selection. It took an unbeaten 20-ball 37 from Tim David to take RCB to 163/7, with 36 runs coming off the last two overs.Devdutt Padikkal‚Äôs stay at the crease was laboured and Mukesh Kumar ended it in quick time. The hosts ended the Powerplay with 64/2. The onus was on Kohli and skipper Rajat Patidar (25) to resuscitate the innings, but Capitals unleashed leggie Nigam to render the boisterous crowd speechless.Kohli, looking to drive, failed to control his shot and Starc rushed in from long-off to complete a brilliant catch. Axar Patel‚Äôs blend of spin and pace attack choked the RCB batters and ensured wickets at regular intervals. Kuldeep Yadav (2/17) and Nigam, with their googlies and flighted deliveries, were impressive",Delhi Capitals beat Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) by six wickets. KL Rahul (93 not out) and Tristan Stubbs (38) scored the winning runs. RCB were bowled out for 164 in their 20 overs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120187682,imgsize-49838,width-400,resizemode-4/KLrahul.jpg"

Poll Do you believe that home advantage is significant in IPL matches? No, it doesn't matter Yes, it plays a crucial role

Bombay Sport Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 2: GroupM's Vinit Karnik on IPL's growth and emerging sports

'Gill going to hold us in good stead'

Jos Buttler Exclusive Interview: I owe Jayawardene for letting me open in T20

Way forward

Sai Sudharsan Exclusive Interview: 'The dream is to play Test cricket'

In football, home advantage counts for a lot. The hosts are aware of the pitch, the stadium, and enjoy local support which plays a big part in swaying the referees and creating hostile environments for the visitors.In cricket, especially franchise cricket such as the Indian Premier League ( IPL ), that isn't necessarily the case. The teams can't dictate the make-up of the surface but the other tangibles remain the same: fans, understanding the conditions and the dimensions of the stadium. These are all aspects that the home teams are expected to know more than the visiting sides.Defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) were one of the teams that made the most of home conditions in their title run. They, alongside Chennai Super Kings (CSK), Delhi Capitals (DC) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), won five home matches last season. Last year, as Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) reeled off six straight wins to qualify for the playoffs, three of them came at home.This season, plenty has been made of lack of home advantage. KKR skipper Ajinkya Rahane, Lucknow Super Giants mentor Zaheer Khan and CSK coach Stephen Fleming have been the loudest voices against curators not preparing surfaces suitable for the home teams. PBKS assistant bowling coach Trevor Gonsalves argued, ""there is no home advantage in the IPL.""When probed about the franchise vs curator debate, Gujarat Titans COO Colonel Arvinder Singh told TimesofIndia.com, ""Look, the rules and regulations on this are very clear and not just from this season. They've been clear right from the very beginning.""""The rules of the game are very clear and they are common for everybody. No franchise has any right to say, 'I want this kind of a pitch'. That's not something that the rules allow you to do.""""The home advantage has to stem from the fact that that is your home. You are supposed to know those conditions better than anybody else who's coming because that is where you play most of your games, where you practice. So from that perspective, if you're looking at a home advantage, well, why not? You deserve all the home advantage that you can take.""To say that I need home advantage because I want this kind of a pitch. Sorry, I don't think that cuts any ice with anybody,"" he added.The IPL Playing Conditions back Singh's argument. As per 'The Match' definitions, section 1.11 reads, ""Ground Authority is the entity responsible for the selection and preparation of the pitch and other functions relating to the hosting and management of the match, including any agents acting on their behalf (including but not limited to the curator or other ground staff).""For the record, the 2022 champions have made a promising start at their home venue in Narendra Modi Stadium, winning two of three played so far.Zoom out even further and GT have been stellar with the season 24 matches through. They've posted four wins out of five played, pocketed eight points, and sit top of the pile as things stand.With former IPL champions such as five-time winners CSK and MI struggling alongside SRH, KKR and RR, GT are the only former champions who haven't lost the plot in the 18th season.""I think it's still early days. By God's grace, yes we have done well thus far, but there's still a long way to go. It's a long drawn tournament. So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves and start thinking of the playoffs already. There's a long way to go and we need to win more games,"" said Col. Singh.""It's not easy to get to the top four and be there consistently. Some teams continue the same momentum throughout and some teams start early, but are not able to sustain that momentum. And then you suddenly find somebody coming through, like what happened with RCB last year.""So it's too early to discount anything and say that any former champion or even those who have not been champions are out of the race this early in the tournament,"" he added.In his opening season as GT captain last year, Shubman Gill had a challenging start. Having taken over from Hardik Pandya, GT finished eighth in IPL 2024. The decision to appoint Gill as captain raised eyebrows, especially considering the fact that he had led his state side Punjab in only two matches. To make matters worse for the top-order batter, runs dried up too.Early days in IPL 2025 but the team has looked promising with Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler, Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna all making an impact.Col. Singh feels vindicated with his, and the management's, choice of backing Gill when not many held that enthusiasm.""It is his coming of age now as a leader more than a captain. You can see it in his body language, the control, whether it's the strategy that he's adopting, whether he's reacting to situations on ground. It's amazing to see how young Shubman has developed into a leader of the pack and still being able to be one of the finest players as far as GT is concerned,"" said the franchise COO of Gill who has scored 148 runs in five innings this season at a strike rate of 146.53.""So it is amazing to see his growth. We have always said that at GT we like to do things from a longer-term perspective and not look at short-term solutions. So last time we were criticised a little bit to say that, you know, it's too early for him (to captain) and there were other options available. But you're always looking at it from a longer-term perspective, you know, and I think we can happily say that that decision was a good decision and it's going to hold us in good stead over a number of years going forward,"" he explained further.With an eye always on the long-term picture, GT plan on recalibrating after the season ends to devise a growth strategy, such as a potential Women's Premier League (WPL) team.Ahmedabad-based Torrent Group , a healthcare major, had acquired a majority 67 per cent stake in GT before the season began. While the specifics of the deal were not made official, the figure is expected to highlight the growth of the franchises and IPL by extension.As per reports, CVC had bought GT in 2021 for Rs 5,625 crore. For the majority acquisition, Torrent Group is believed to have spent Rs 5025 crore which takes GT's valuation at Rs 7500 crore.It is in keeping with the growth story of the IPL, which has grown faster than Gold and the Sensex since its inception in 2008.""When we started out in 2008, nobody knew how it was going to pan out. It took more than a couple of years for IPL to kind of realise its potential,"" said Col. Singh who has been part of Kings XI Punjab, Gujarat Lions and Gujarat Titans during his various IPL stints.""It was only after the fourth or fifth year, where it was a gradual growth all along. But after the fourth year, we realised that it is the quality of cricket that is going to define the longevity of the league. It is the quality of the cricket that happens on the ground, the quality of players and the type of cricket that is showcased therein which is going to draw in eyeballs.""At that point we realised it is something that, as Indians, we can be proud of. Today you see what it has grown into. In terms of growth, it is more than 10x (from) where it started off.""IPL has seen its ups and downs over the number of years. But if you look at a sporting property in 17 years where nothing like this had ever happened in our country. From what it was and what it is today, I think it is something that all of us can be pretty proud of,"" he concluded.","Gujarat Titans COO Colonel Arvinder Singh says there is no home advantage in the IPL. The 2022 champions have made a promising start at their home venue in Narendra Modi Stadium, winning two of three played so far. Last year, as Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) reeled off six straight wins to qualify for the playoffs, three of them came at home.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120186948,imgsize-37658,width-400,resizemode-4/Gujarat-Titans-COO-Colonel-Arvinder-Singh.jpg"

Opener or No. 3, which position suits you better?

There are so many contenders for that slot in the Indian team. How does the intense competition make you feel?

Which batter or left-hander have you fashioned your game on?

You are the fastest Indian to 1000

runs. Next target?

You were bought for Rs 20 lakh in 2022 and retained before this IPL for Rs 8.5 cr. That‚Äôs a quantum leap. Does that motivate or unnerve you?

You played for Surrey in 2023. Are you looking at a county contract this year too?

How has it been playing alongside former England captain Jos Buttler?

MUMBAI: IPL 2025 is turning into a happy hunting ground for Tamil Nadu opener Sai Sudharsan . He is the second-highest run-getter of the season so far, with only Lucknow Super Giants‚Äô Nicholas Pooran ahead of him.Anybody would love to open the innings in T20s. You have a little bit more time. I‚Äôm enjoying opening in this format.India has great talent and there are quality openers and top-order batters. I focus on myself and try to improve so I can be a better batter. Whenever I get an opportunity to play for the country, I should be equipped for that.I‚Äôve been watching a lot of Murali Vijay (former India & Tamil Nadu opener) videos. I love the way he moved at the crease and the way he batted.The record for most runs in the IPL, I‚Äôd love to have that. But right now, it‚Äôs all about taking baby steps and going for wins.That‚Äôs a good question. I look at it differently. Now I‚Äôm in a different price bracket. It gives me more freedom because there is no fear or restriction from my point of view. It‚Äôs all about cricket from now on. It‚Äôs all about exploring and giving my best rather than thinking about what I will do to earn money.I‚Äôd love to play a few more county games. A county stint will definitely have a big impact on my batting. I was exposed to a lot of difficult fast bowling and swinging conditions when I played for Surrey.It‚Äôs been exciting. The experience and knowledge that he brings reassures me out there. I get to learn a lot from him.","Sai Sudharsan is the second-highest run-getter of the season so far.

Poll What aspect of Jitesh Sharma's game do you find most impressive? Quick reflexes behind the stumps Power-hitting in the death overs

BENGALURU: Coming in at No. 6 in the 16th over against Mumbai Indians on Monday, Jitesh Sharma got going against Trent Boult following up a boundary with a maximum. In fact, the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) wicketkeeper-bat scored 24 off eight Boult deliveries. He even picked up a loose ball from Jasprit Bumrah to send it into the long-on stands during his unbeaten 19-ball 40.Sharma‚Äôs repertoire of shots garnered a lot of attention. A utility player of high value, Sharma, who was roped in by RCB for Rs 11 crore this season, came into his own with the Punjab Kings in 2022. At RCB, Dinesh Karthik has taken the 31-year-old under his wings and the result ‚Äî from one finisher to another ‚Äî is telling.Sharma, a like-to-like replacement to Karthik ‚Äî who hung up his boots after last season ‚Äî worked extensively with the now RCB batting coach during the off-season. On the eve of RCB‚Äôs home game against Delhi Capitals, Sharma spoke about Karthik‚Äôs role in reshaping his game.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a great journey till now. During the off-season I worked hard with him (Karthik). The shots I am playing right now are a replica of what he used to play. He is trying to turn me into a new player because he believes that I can play all around the circle.‚ÄùAfter an underwhelming 2024 season, Sharma emphasised on the mental blocks he has been able to clear.‚ÄúLast year‚Äôs performance was because of mental issues. I was not mentally in the game because I was thinking ahead and about the future. When I met Dinesh bhai, he told me that it‚Äôs a human error. It‚Äôs not rocket science; it happens to everyone,‚Äù he explained.Having sorted his mental demons, Sharma also revealed that confidence building is a part of his training regime.‚ÄúMy confidence doesn‚Äôt rely on the score. It always depends on my process and how I train. It‚Äôs because, if I have confidence in the end result, then the variables go up and down. So, I mostly keep my confidence high during practice,‚Äù he added.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) wicketkeeper-bat scored 24 off eight Boult deliveries.
