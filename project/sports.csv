NHL Trade Rumors: JJ Peterka emerges as potential trade piece in Buffalo Sabres’ offseason plans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-jj-peterka-emerges-as-potential-trade-piece-in-buffalo-sabres-offseason-plans/articleshow/121884950.cms,"The Buffalo Sabres are reportedly considering trading winger JJ Peterka despite his breakout season (Image via AP)

NHL insider says Sabres are now listening to trade offers for JJ Peterka

General manager Kevyn Adams isn’t rushing but can’t ignore the market





The Buffalo Sabres are heading into one of the most critical offseasons in recent memory, and winger JJ Peterka has suddenly found himself at the center of trade speculation. After missing the playoffs yet again, the Sabres are under immense pressure to reshape the roster—and Peterka could be one of the first major moves.The 22-year-old German forward had a breakout 2024–25 season, posting 27 goals and 41 assists across 77 games. His performance has drawn attention around the league, especially with Buffalo reportedly exploring trade offers in what could become a sign-and-trade deal.According to respected NHL insider Elliotte Friedman, the Sabres are “listening to trade offers for JJ Peterka.” While this doesn’t confirm a deal is imminent, it shows the team is at least open to the idea of moving on from one of its most productive young players.Peterka is a restricted free agent, meaning the Sabres still hold considerable control over his future. However, if contract negotiations stall, a trade could quickly become the preferred option—especially if it brings back key assets to help Buffalo finally return to playoff contention.Sabres GM Kevyn Adams has reportedly pushed back against the idea that Peterka is actively being shopped, but the interest from other teams is real.With Buffalo finishing 36-39-7 and near the bottom of the Atlantic Division, it’s clear a more aggressive roster overhaul is on the table.Peterka’s high upside makes him a valuable trade chip, and if the right offer comes in, Adams may have no choice but to consider it. A sign-and-trade could give the Sabres both cap flexibility and a meaningful return in players or picks.For now, it’s just talk—but in an offseason where Buffalo needs bold moves, JJ Peterka’s name won’t be disappearing from trade rumors anytime soon. Whether he stays or goes may set the tone for the Sabres’ rebuild and playoff hopes in 2026.Also Read: Shocking Hockey Canada sexual assault trial ends as judge’s verdict on disgraced NHL stars looms on July 24","The Buffalo Sabres are reportedly considering trading winger JJ Peterka.

“ARE YOU INSANE?”: NHL fans blast Florida Panthers over outrageous Game 6 ticket prices ahead of potential Stanley Cup win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/are-you-insane-nhl-fans-blast-florida-panthers-over-outrageous-game-6-ticket-prices-ahead-of-potential-stanley-cup-win/articleshow/121885018.cms,"Florida Panthers face criticism for high ticket prices for Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals (Getty Images)

With prices topping $3,000, fans question if loyalty is being priced out of the Stanley Cup Finals experience





The Florida Panthers are on the verge of making history, but for many fans, the cost of witnessing a potential back-to-back Stanley Cup victory in person is nothing short of shocking. As the team prepares to host the Edmonton Oilers in a decisive Game 6 at Amerant Bank Arena, a wave of backlash is building over the sky-high ticket prices for the marquee matchup.According to a post by Five Reasons Sports on X (formerly Twitter), ticket prices for Game 6 are starting at a staggering $944 and climbing well beyond $3,000 for premium seating. While upper-level seats remain just under the $1,000 mark, fans are finding it difficult to justify the hefty price tags. The caption on the viral post summed up the sentiment: “It’s a bit pricy to watch the Panthers win another Stanley Cup…”Many fans are choosing to support their team from home or bars rather than shell out thousands. One user echoed this frustration, writing, “I saw that this morning and decided I’ll be watching from home or at a bar.” Another added sarcastically, “Bruh what? Is Messi playing or something?”—highlighting the disbelief over the pricing for a hockey game.One Oilers fan shared, “Flying down from Vancouver with row 1 club seats. Weren’t cheap,” while another seemed resigned to both the financial hit and a loss, writing, “Well, all those ppl are going to be disappointed.”""Husband: we could get $5k for our 2 seats and pay for next year if we sell them Me: ARE YOU INSANE? There’s a number but knowone would pay it for me to not go to game 6 lol"", another commented.This isn’t the first time NHL teams have come under fire for capitalizing on historic or emotional moments.

Ron Taylor cause of death: How the former member of Mets' 1969 World Series team passed away?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/ron-taylor-cause-of-death-how-the-former-member-of-mets-1969-world-series-team-passed-away/articleshow/121896477.cms,"Ron Taylor, World Series Champion Turned Team Doctor, Passes Away at 87 (Michael Karas/NorthJersey.com)

Dr. Ron Taylor died Monday at age 87 in Toronto after a lengthy illness







Ron Taylor, a two-time World Series champion and one of the key relievers behind the New York Mets’ unforgettable 1969 title run, passed away on Monday at the age of 87 after a prolonged illness. Known for his poise under pressure and dedication to excellence, Taylor’s contributions extended far beyond the mound.During his 11-year MLB career, Taylor wore the jerseys of five different teams—Cleveland, St. Louis, Houston, New York, and San Diego. It was with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1964 that he first experienced championship glory. But his most iconic moment came in 1969 with the ""Miracle Mets.""Taylor was a steady presence in the Mets’ bullpen from 1967 to 1971, posting a 3.04 ERA, 1.14 WHIP, and securing 50 saves over 269 games. In the 1969 season, his performance peaked. He led the team with 59 appearances, recording 13 saves and a 2.72 ERA. One of his defining moments came in Game 2 of the World Series against the heavily favored Baltimore Orioles. With two runners on base, Taylor coolly retired Hall of Famer Brooks Robinson, sealing a critical 2-1 win for New York.“Ron was the only guy on our staff with postseason experience,” teammate Art Shamsky reflected in a statement issued by the Mets.“He had won a championship with the Cardinals in 1964 and brought a winning mentality. We don’t win the title without Ron Taylor.”After his retirement from baseball, Taylor chose a path rarely taken by professional athletes. He returned to Canada and enrolled in medical school at the University of Toronto, earning his degree in 1977. By 1979, he found his way back into baseball—this time as the Toronto Blue Jays’ team physician, a position he held for more than three decades.Taylor’s legacy was celebrated with his induction into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985. He later became part of two more World Series-winning teams as a physician during the Blue Jays’ back-to-back titles in 1992 and 1993.Ron Taylor’s life was a rare blend of athletic excellence and medical service—a legacy that leaves a lasting mark both on and off the field.Also Read: MLB reveals first All-Star vote results with Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani dominating early fan support","Ron Taylor, a two-time World Series champion, died Monday at the age of 87.

With the 2025 MLB All-Star Game set for July 15 at Atlanta’s Truist Park, the excitement is already heating up—and it’s New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge and Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani who are stealing the spotlight. According to the first update from Phase 1 of the All-Star voting released on Monday, both players are leading their respective leagues with massive vote counts.Aaron Judge, who has been in red-hot form this season, leads all of Major League Baseball with 1,568,527 votes. If his top position holds until June 26, when Phase 1 concludes at 12 p.m. ET, he’ll become the first back-to-back overall vote leader since Alex Rodriguez achieved the feat in 2007 and 2008. Close behind is Ohtani, who sits atop the National League with 1,398,771 votes. With just under a month left, the gap is tight, and a last-minute surge could tip the balance.“The leading vote-getters for the American and National League when Phase 1 finishes will automatically get starting spots in the All-Star lineups, bypassing the next round of voting,” MLB confirmed.Shohei Ohtani isn’t alone in the million-vote club.He’s joined by Dodgers teammates Freddie Freeman and Will Smith, as well as the Cubs’ Pete Crow-Armstrong and the Mets’ Francisco Lindor.

NBA Trade Rumors: NBA insider spilled beans on how Kevin Durant’s trade outlook shifts after Desmond Bane joins Orlando Magic,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/nba-trade-rumors-nba-insider-spilled-beans-on-how-kevin-durants-trade-outlook-shifts-after-desmond-bane-joins-orlando-magic/articleshow/121888262.cms,"Kevin Durant.

Desmond Bane’s blockbuster trade could reshape Kevin Durant’s market value

Desmond Bane's shocking trade to the Orlando Magic has caused ripple effects far beyond the Eastern Conference playoff picture. According to league insiders, the deal not only enhances Orlando's firepower but also shifts the perception of trade value across the league, particularly for highly talked-about stars like Kevin Durant. As teams gauge the market, comparisons to Bane’s trade package are forcing executives to reevaluate how much it will actually take to acquire a player of Durant’s caliber.After the Magic landed Desmond Bane in exchange for Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Cole Anthony, and four first-round draft picks— plus a pick swap— front offices around the league started taking notice. Though Bane has never made an All-Star team, the return Memphis got for him was massive. One executive told ESPN, “Everyone has to throw their prior precedents and baselines out.”The source made it clear that recent deals, including the one that sent five first-rounders to Brooklyn for Mikal Bridges, shouldn’t be used as a template for valuing Kevin Durant. “Those deals don't mean Durant is worth 12 firsts now,” the executive added. The point being: while Bane’s value is high, Durant’s situation is far more complex.Durant, 36, is certainly one of the most skilled scorers in NBA history. However, age, injury concerns, and a massive contract complicate his trade value. According to ESPN’s Shams Charania, Durant is open to a contract extension with three teams— the Houston Rockets, Miami Heat, and San Antonio Spurs. Despite that short list, the Minnesota Timberwolves continue to be linked to him by league insiders.Any potential package going to Phoenix isn’t expected to top what Memphis got for Bane. That reality could shape how Phoenix approaches the situation and whether Durant is moved at all this summer.Meanwhile, Orlando's acquisition of Bane signals a serious shift in ambition. “Over his five years in the NBA, Desmond has distinguished himself as one of the elite guards in our league,” said Magic president Jeff Weltman. “We look forward to his shooting, IQ, and wide-ranging skill set.”Bane, who averaged 19.2 points per game while shooting 39% from three this season, is exactly the kind of player Orlando lacked. The Magic ranked last in the NBA in both three-point shooting percentage and makes per game, a major flaw for a playoff team looking to contend.Also Read: Orlando Magic make major jersey number change for Desmond Bane after blockbuster trade with Memphis Grizzlies While the Magic get sharper, the Durant saga raises several questions.

A Blizzard of Goals Puts Florida a Win Away From Glory | 32 Thoughts

Top NHL teams in the Western Conference could pursue Mitch Marner







The NHL offseason buzz is centered on Toronto Maple Leafs forward Mitch Marner, and his teammates may have already revealed the biggest clue. Several Leafs players reportedly believe Marner’s next destination lies out West, away from the pressure cooker of Toronto and the emotional ties to the Eastern Conference.As NHL insider Elliotte Friedman recently shared, the belief in the Leafs locker room is that Marner wants a full reset, and a Western Conference team would offer just that. While the Carolina Hurricanes have shown interest, Friedman downplayed their chances, pointing instead to a desire for a clean break and long-term distance from his current team.Since entering the league, Mitch Marner has carried both the hopes and frustrations of Toronto Maple Leafs fans. Postseason disappointments and salary cap debates have often overshadowed a skilled playmaker and top-line winger, Marner’s regular-season consistency.The attention and pressure from the Canadian hockey market have seemingly taken a toll. After years of scrutiny, Marner is now believed to be craving something the Leafs can no longer provide, freedom from expectations.As trade talks heat up, several NHL teams in the Western Conference are emerging as potential fits for Mitch Marner.Though no official suitors have been named, teams like the Los Angeles Kings, Vegas Golden Knights, and Seattle Kraken have cap space and a desire to bolster their top-six forward groups.Early offseason chatter linked Marner to the Boston Bruins and Florida Panthers, but remaining in the Atlantic Division now appears unlikely. Facing the Maple Leafs multiple times each season while still in the Eastern spotlight runs counter to Marner’s apparent desire to fade from that narrative.Read more: Trade news: Blackhawks send Victor Söderström to Bruins for Ryan Mast and a draft pick According to teammate insight and league reports, this is about more than hockey.

The Pittsburgh Penguins have made a seismic decision about one of their biggest stars. Evgeni Malkin, the face of the franchise alongside Sidney Crosby and Kris Letang, appears to be nearing the end of his Penguins journey. Insider reports suggest that Malkin will not be offered a contract extension after the 2025–26 NHL season.This news breaks just a few years after the Penguins opted to retain their “Big 3” with multi-year deals. Malkin’s current four-year contract, signed in 2022, will expire at the end of next season. With no extension on the horizon, all signs point to a final curtain in Pittsburgh for the 37-year-old forward.The latest NHL trade rumor has fans and analysts buzzing. If Malkin chooses to continue his career after his contract ends, he will likely do so in a different jersey. According to trusted reports from team insiders, the Penguins do not plan to re-sign him, setting the stage for either a surprise trade or a free-agent departure.Though no trade has been confirmed, speculation continues to mount about whether the team could move Malkin before his contract ends, especially if the playoff picture remains out of reach.For many in Pittsburgh, the idea of Malkin, known fondly as “Geno,” leaving the franchise is hard to imagine. But with limited options left, retirement or relocation may soon become a reality.Evgeni Malkin’s legendary run with the Pittsburgh Penguins is undoubtedly winding down. The Russian center has played over 1,200 games for the team, collecting more than 1,300 points and becoming a central figure in three Stanley Cup wins.

Yashasvi Jaiswal : Young blood, big dreams

Shubman Gill: A captain with a point to prove

A defining series for India’s next batting order





As India gear up for their five-Test tour of England beginning June 20 at Headingley, all eyes will be on the next generation of Indian batters. With stalwarts Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli no longer in the Test setup, the spotlight shifts to KL Rahul Yashasvi Jaiswal , and newly-appointed skipper Shubman Gill—each bearing different responsibilities and career arcs as they look to anchor India’s top order in alien conditions.At 33, KL Rahul is the most experienced batter in the squad. With 955 runs from 13 Tests against England, including three centuries, Rahul’s quality is undeniable—but so is his inconsistency.His 149 at The Oval in 2018 remains iconic, crafted when India were tottering at 121/5. Yet, in the same series, Rahul aggregated only 152 runs in his remaining nine innings. The pattern repeated in the 2021 tour, where his majestic 129 at Lord’s helped India to a famous win, only to be followed by single-digit scores thereafter.Rahul averages 34.11 in English conditions and has often struggled to convert promising starts. With the experience of over a decade behind him, this series could define whether Rahul finally sheds his tag of ""flashes of brilliance"" and matures into India’s dependable pillar in the middle order.In contrast stands 23-year-old Yashasvi Jaiswal, who has stormed into Test cricket with a blend of fearlessness and flair.He enters this tour as India’s highest scorer in the previous Border-Gavaskar Trophy and the team’s new senior opener.Jaiswal’s home Test average of 60.61 across 10 matches is stunning, but this tour will be his biggest challenge yet. His away average (44.18) is respectable, though the swinging Dukes ball, early movement, and long spells from England’s seamers will ask questions he’s never faced before.With no Virat or Rohit to turn to for guidance, Jaiswal must lead India’s charge from the top with composure and intent. His hunger and recent form make him a key player to watch.Shubman Gill takes on the toughest job in cricket which is leading India in a Test series in England, while still evolving as a player himself. His overall Test average at home is an impressive 42.03, but it drops significantly overseas (29.50), and his record in England is particularly underwhelming: just 88 runs in three matches at an average of 14.66.Now, with captaincy adding weight to his already high expectations, the question isn’t just about runs, it’s about temperament. Gill will be judged not only on how he bats but how he leads a team missing its most iconic modern-day batters. Former teammate Cheteshwar Pujara has expressed faith in Gill’s ability to rise to the occasion. For now, belief will have to carry him until the runs come.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? India’s tour of England in 2025 will be the first full Test series without either Kohli or Rohit since 2011. The burden of scoring and leadership is now shared between a veteran seeking consistency (Rahul), a young gun on the rise (Jaiswal), and a captain still forging his identity (Gill).Their performances may well shape not only the outcome of this series, but also set the tone for India's fortunes in the ongoing World Test Championship cycle.","KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill will lead India in five-Test series against England.

What did Stephen Curry's dad say about his retirement?

Dell Curry and Stephen





Fans of Stephen Curry have spent countless sleepless nights over the topic of his retirement. While he hasn't announced his retirement yet, it’s evident that he is contemplating his post-NBA career options. He is still under contract with the Golden State Warriors through the 2026-27 season and may even think about extending it.However, Stephen’s father, Dell Curry, recently addressed the topic of his retirement. In a conversation with DJ Siddiqi, Dell talked about his own experience of nearing retirement and suggested that for Stephen, the decision will likely come down to whether he still has the motivation to keep pace with the demanding preparation that is crucial for the NBA.“I think it’ll come down to—not necessarily his skill, or what he can do in a game in the season,” Curry said. “I think it’s a matter of, can he go through the rigours of preparing himself to play in an NBA season? I know when I retired, that was a big factor.""""I just didn’t feel like I had the energy, the effort to work and train throughout the summer. So I wouldn’t short myself, my teammates or the fans and give my all during that season.I think that’s what it’ll come down to.”But Dell also confirmed that he doesn’t see a retirement announcement coming from Stephen anytime soon. “He still loves the game,” Curry said. “He’s a competitive guy. He wants to win another title, so we’re not even close to that window yet. But when the time comes, I think he’ll make the right decision.”","Stephen Curry is still under contract with the Golden State Warriors through the 2026-27 season.

“My dad tried to kill..”: Wayne Gretzky opens up about how his father tried to stop ‘The Great One’ nickname from sticking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/my-dad-tried-to-kill-wayne-gretzky-opens-up-about-how-his-father-tried-to-stop-the-great-one-nickname-from-sticking/articleshow/121885490.cms,"Wayne Gretzky's iconic nickname, ""The Great One,"" originated from a profile of his youth hockey dominance (Getty Images)

A nickname born out of early dominance on the ice

Acceptance of a name that would define a legacy

Panthers Win Game 5 to Take 3-2 Lead in Stanley Cup Final | NHL on TNT





Wayne Gretzky is a name synonymous with greatness in the NHL , but the origin of his famous nickname, ""The Great One,"" has a surprising twist. During a recent segment on NHL on TNT’s Face Off, Gretzky shared that his father, Walter Gretzky, was not a fan of the moniker when it first appeared during his youth hockey days.Long before Wayne Gretzky shattered NHL records, he was just a ten-year-old prodigy from Brantford, Ontario, netting an unbelievable 400 goals in a single season. A reporter from the London Free Press came to profile the young phenom. At the conclusion of the article, the journalist proposed a fitting nickname: “The Great One,” drawing inspiration from legends like “Mr. Hockey” and “The Golden Jet.”“They said, ‘We should just call him The Great One,’” Gretzky recalled. “Well, my dad tried to kill that right away — it just kept coming back.”Walter Gretzky believed such a title placed unnecessary pressure on his young son. He didn’t want Wayne to bear the weight of premature hype. But despite his father's objections, the nickname gained traction and became permanently linked to the budding superstar.Over time, the family had no choice but to embrace the label. “Finally, I just was like, ‘Well, we’re going to have to live with it,’” Gretzky admitted.And live with it he did. By the time he retired in 1999, Gretzky had not only fulfilled but exceeded the expectations that came with such a grand title. With 894 goals, 2,857 career points, and 61 NHL records, “The Great One” wasn’t just a nickname—it became his rightful legacy.Switching gears to current NHL action, Gretzky also shared his thoughts on the Edmonton Oilers' Game 5 loss to the Florida Panthers. “Right from the get-go, Florida played a really smart, intelligent road game,” he said, noting that Edmonton looked “cautious” and “on their heels” early on.Also Read: No longer Canadian: Wayne Gretzky’s Canadian identity questioned after Donald Trump friendship sparks controversy From a childhood nickname to a storied NHL career, Gretzky’s story remains one of humility, brilliance, and enduring greatness.","Wayne Gretzky's famous nickname, ""The Great One,"" originated from a profile of his youth hockey dominance.

NEW DELHI: Just like every IPL season throws up young talents with remarkable abilities with both bat and ball, IPL 2025 too unearthed future stars for Indian cricket. Among them was mystery spinner Digvesh Rathi, who made a name for himself with an impressive showing for the Lucknow Super Giants. Rathi played 13 matches and picked up 14 wickets, impressing with his control over the run flow and his knack for striking at crucial moments.Following his breakout IPL season, Rathi has continued to dominate at the local level.In a video shared by the official X handle of LSG and team owner Sanjiv Goenka, Rathi is seen achieving a rare feat — picking up five wickets in five balls.""Digvesh Rathi. 5 stars,"" LSG's X handle wrote while posting the clip.""Stumbled upon this clip of Digvesh Rathi taking 5 in 5 in a local T20 game.

'Your main job is to perform... captaincy is secondary': Ex-England captain Graham Gooch on Shubman Gill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-tour-of-england/exclusive-your-main-job-is-to-perform-captaincy-is-secondary-ex-england-captain-graham-gooch-on-shubman-gill/articleshow/121897307.cms,"Shubman Gill (left) and Graham Gooch (BCCI | File)

Leeds:

Excerpts...

The England tour starts a new era in Indian cricket. Your thoughts on the side under Shubman Gill. He is just 25 and still work-in-progress as a Test batter. Will leading the inexperienced side be a real challenge for him?

Having led England and then the kind of success you had with the bat during the period, what would be the one piece of advice you will give to Gill? Not every player is able to handle the pressure of captaincy.

Poll Do you believe Shubman Gill will successfully lead the inexperienced Indian team against England? Yes, he has the talent and potential. No, it's too much pressure for him. It depends on how the team performs.

A lot is being said about the Indian team but you reckon England, too, will have a point to prove? They didn't have a good series against India last time the two sides met in the longest format.

Do you think this aggressive style of cricket also opens up plenty of opportunities for the inexperienced Indian unit? England could leave some doors open because of the cricket they play.

How much say will the absence of two stalwarts of Indian cricket - Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma - will have on the series? Do you reckon England have a slight edge because they don't have to worry about two world class cricketers?

Shubman Gill returns to the city where it all started for him as a youngster

Different venues present different challenges in England. How different are they from each other and what should a visiting team keep in mind?

So it could mean hard work for the bowlers...

Before we sign off, I don't want to stir the plate of prawns again but any food suggestions for the visitors?





India are set to face England in the first Test of the five-match series in Leeds from June 20. The Shubman Gill-led unit has been preparing for over two weeks now and even featured in an intra-squad game in Beckenham. Ahead of the series opener, TimesofIndia.com spoke to former England captain Graham Gooch who, in a free-wheeling chat, spoke at length about captaincy, challenge for Shubman Gill , why England have a point to prove and what one can expect from the pitches this summer.It's a new era, isn't it? My view is that if one door closes, another one opens. I'm sure they'll give a good account of themselves. Talent in the Indian cricket team is undoubted. It's just that there's some big shoes to fill with Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli retiring. It will be a big loss if Bumrah doesn't lead the attack in all the games. I mean, obviously, he's a world-class bowler. The pressure will be on, but some of the younger players will have to step up. And the captain, it's a great honour to captain your country, and I'm sure he'll (Gill) handle it in a good way.I don't quite agree with the pressure. Some people are not up to the pressure. I don't agree with that sentiment. I believe that being made captain of your country is the greatest honour a performer can receive.Because you're not just captain of the other 10 players, you're captain of your sport. So your responsibility as a role model and as an ambassador to set the tone for your country's cricket system, from professional cricketers down to cricketers who play zonal cricket in your country, and the youngsters, the boys and girls who aspire to play for India or for representative teams, your responsibility is to set the tone and be an example for all the cricketers in your country.So it's more than just a captain in a team. I think that honour should inspire you as a player. It certainly has inspired me. I don't always subscribe to the view that it's more pressure. You've got to do it your own way and you've got to be yourself, not copy anyone. I think the most important thing for a captain is you've got to perform. Your main job in the team is to perform, with the bat in his case. So he has to do that. Captaincy is secondary to performing. And if you perform well yourself, that makes the captaincy easier.I think England have a point to prove because whereas I'm in favour of the type of cricket they're trying to play, exciting, expressive, on the front foot type cricket, to set the tone of the game, to take the game to the opposition. I'm in favour of that, but the record suggests that they've had some spectacular series where they've won and they've lost some as well.I think the big factor for England is, whereas you want to go on the attacker's map, they've done a great job. When you need to play smart in test cricket, you have to play smart. Does that make sense? You can't go all out attack every time. You have to play the situation. If such a situation requires you to dig in a bit, then you have to dig in. But England, over the last few years, have gone on the attack possibly too much. But the general principle of what they're trying to do, I think it's good for test cricket. Because as we all know, test cricket is under pressure from franchise cricket, hugely.I think Ben Stokes ' stated aim is that he doesn't want to draw any test matches. He's not interested in drawing the test if he can't win it. Which leaves a bit of a question. Sometimes it's impossible to win the test. The hardest thing in a five-day test is to create a winning opportunity. It doesn't mean you always take that winning opportunity. But you play for two, three, four days even to create a winning opportunity maybe on the last day. And England play for that.And they've stated to all the world, or Ben Stokes has, that that's the way he wants to play. So sometimes you can find yourself in a difficult situation in a test where maybe you have to save the game or whatever. You have to play every situation individually. So that gives the opposition, not an advantage, but they know how England want to play. So they know they're going to go all out and they're not interested in a draw.The home advantage gives England a slight edge, yeah. Because we're used to those conditions. Although a different bowling attack now with Anderson and Broad retiring. So England are still trying to work out what their best bowling attack is. We're playing your guys and Australia back-to-back, the two best sides in the world. So we're still trying to work out what their best bowling attack is. So there's a little bit of a question mark there. But given English conditions where the ball moves around off the seam, now India have got some pretty good seamers as well, especially if Bumrah plays. So they will be competitive without a doubt. But I think home advantage will give England a slight edge, but not too much of an edge.I think what you've got to consider is we've had a very dry summer here so far. There's been hardly any rain for the last three months. And that means that all the pitches will be quite dry. And I don't think they will, I mean, all English venues want the match to go four days. So unlike some other parts of the world. Where you can make the ball do whatever you want. Over here, the grounds, they want the match to go four days. Do you understand what I'm saying? So they will try and produce pretty flat pitches. They might seem around a little bit and they might turn a little bit towards the end. But they'll be pretty, generally, they'll be pretty good pitches, generally.Well, we've had an unusually dry first half of the summer. You know, there's no rain, hardly March and April. And a little bit of rain lately. So they should be dry. And good pitches. So the bowlers will have to work hard.(Laughs) I am sure if they want to try the tiger prawns over here, they will be fine.","India face England in the first Test of the five-match series in Leeds from June 20.

And secondly, in that final, what I noticed was, in a strategic timeout, you spent a long time telling Virat Kohli what to do. He was at the crease and you spent a long time, I saw you there, pointing at him, and I think he was out the very next over, after your five-minute lecture.

The first part, at least, I can manage.""""The second part, I'm trying to think, without getting scarred for my life, I need to say the right answer.""The former India wicketkeeper shot back at Atherton and asked, ""What did you think I was telling him, considering he got out the next over?""To which the ex-England skipper said: ""Well, I don't know.I just thought, what is this man telling one of the greatest batters that has ever walked the earth?

After Gukesh Dommaraju won the Candidates last year in Toronto, Garry Kasparov — former world champion and one of the greatest players in history — famously said, “The ‘children’ of Vishy Anand are on the loose.” He later hailed Gukesh's achievement as “shifting tectonic plates in the chess world. ”Kasparov was proved right when, six months later, at the age of 18, Gukesh became the youngest world chess champion in history, surpassing Kasparov himself, who had won the crown in 1985 at the age of 22.Kasparov’s prophetic words appear to be coming true.A glimpse of that shift was seen last week at the Tivoli Garden Resort in Delhi’s Chhatarpur, where a cavernous hall — large enough to host an indoor football match — was transformed into a battlefield of brains for a week.The Delhi International Open Grandmasters Chess Tournament, held from June 7 to 14 under the aegis of the Delhi Chess Association (DCA), drew a fascinating mix: Grandmasters (GMs), International Masters (IMs), Women International Masters (WIMs), Candidate Masters (CMs), and Woman FIDE Masters (WFMs) from across the globe.And in that sea of talent, one thing was unmistakable: India’s young stars were setting the board on fire, leaving even seasoned players in awe.Take 36-year-old Georgian GM Tornike Sanikidze. After each game, you’d find him stepping out for a smoke, often joined by compatriot and fellow GM Levan Pantsulaia. Their conversations, between drags, almost always circled back to one theme: the fierce challenge posed by India’s young guns.“This tournament is very beautiful and very hard,” Sanikidze, who was seeded 18th but finished 53rd, admitted to TimesofIndia.com after his final round. “There are so many grandmasters, and so many kids. That makes it a very strong tournament. It was very hard for me.”Sanikidze knows what he’s talking about: “I was here in 2013. Even then, I could see the new generation coming. Back then, I was rated 2518, and I left at 2513; that’s how hard it was to play Indians. And now? Look at the top 10. There are four Indians. The world champion is Indian. That says everything.”Slovak GM Mikuláš Maník, 50, is no stranger to Indian tournaments; this was his 44th. But even he admits he’s been taken aback by the meteoric rise of India’s chess scene.“Every year, the tournaments here get stronger,” Maník observed, often seen outside the playing hall analysing games on a sideboard after a round of play, especially when his opponent was a prodigy.“India has done remarkable work with its young talents. And it’s only getting better. The chess quality here is improving at a rate that’s hard to believe,” he added.Perhaps the most striking perspective came from 80-year-old Rani Hamid, the legendary WIM from Bangladesh and the oldest in the fray.A 20-time national champion and former British chess champion, Hamid has seen decades of subcontinental chess unfold.“ I used to beat Indian girls at will,” she said with a gentle smile. “It felt good back then. But now, look where India is, and where we are. The difference is too big.”And perhaps the veterans have a point.ALSO READ: Why is chess so cruel? Ask Grandmaster SL Narayanan In all, last week in India’s national capital was a snapshot of a global chess community coming to terms with a new order. In this new era, India — with its fearless young players and a growing stable of grandmasters — is not content with being a mere participant. There is a fire in their belly; each one of them wants to win, and without an iota of doubt, India is leading the charge in world chess.",India's young chess players are changing the dynamics of international chess.

As India prepare to take on England in the five-match Test series, tensions are high, with hopes touching the sky and expectations from a relatively young Indian squad pouring over. With just a few days left to go for the start of India's Tour of England, former India international and current RCB mentor and batting coach Dinesh Karthik has made a bold assessment of new captain Shubman Gill 's ascension to the captaincy.In an interaction with Sky Sports Cricket, Karthik makes a stinging remark of what Gill has signed up for, with his prediction of the same calling for caution from the new skipper. ""I really don't think he has realized the enormity of what it means to be a Test captain for India, as of now. He is walking into the lion's den. Coming to England as a cricketing nation is not easy."" The 40-year-old made the argument that many teams with several stars have come in and struggled to perform.However, the veteran was also hopeful of India's chances in the Test, and outlined what Gill and his men can exploit the most to bring about a positive result from the Test series that will mark the dawn of a new era in Indian Test cricket.The series, set to commence om June 20 in Leeds will also mark the start of a new WTC cycle for the country.""Luckily, for Shubman Gill, I think the England bowling attack is a very vulnerable attack. That is the only positive I see. They're gonna be put under pressure with the bat. When I say batting, England batting will definitely put the Indian team under pressure."" said Karthik.As things stand, India is in the final stage of preparations for the England series, with the intra-squad match coming to an end. The match was, however, called off midway on Day 3. The game was supposed to last until Monday, June 16. However, the management called the match off after two and a half days.

As England gears up for their upcoming five-match Test series against India starting June 20, Joe Root stands on the verge of multiple milestones. The English batting star, currently with 13,006 runs in 153 Tests, is pursuing Sachin Tendulkar's all-time record of 15,921 runs, though realistically, Australia great Ricky Ponting's 13,378 is the achievable target. Root will also have the opportunity to surpass Rahul Dravid 's highest batting average in India-England matches.Root's current Test statistics showcase his excellence with an average of 50.80, including 36 centuries and 65 fifties, with a highest score of 262. He ranks as England's highest run-scorer and stands fifth overall in Test cricket.A modest series score of 373 runs would elevate Root past Ricky Ponting's tally of 13,378 runs, making him the second-highest run-getter in Test cricket history. Root's record against India is particularly impressive, accumulating 2,846 runs in 30 Tests at an average of 58.08, with 10 centuries and 11 fifties. His highest score against India stands at 218.In home conditions facing India, Root's performance becomes even more remarkable. He averages 74.95, scoring 1,574 runs in 15 Tests and 25 innings, with seven centuries and five fifties, including an unbeaten 180.Among players with at least 1,500 runs in India-England matches, Root holds the second-highest average of 58.55, trailing only Dravid's 60.93.A few centuries in the upcoming series could push Root past this benchmark.Root's recent form in the World Test Championship (WTC) has been exceptional. He scored 1,968 runs in 22 Tests during the previous cycle, maintaining an average of 54.66 with seven centuries and seven fifties.The English batsman is also approaching another milestone in the WTC, potentially becoming the first player to reach 6,000 runs. He currently leads the charts with 5,543 runs in 64 matches, averaging 51.80 with 18 centuries and 21 fifties in 117 innings.The Test series will commence on June 20 at Leeds, where Root will have the opportunity to pursue these significant achievements.","England face India in a five-match Test series starting June 20.

NEW DELHI: His Bradmanesque run in domestic cricket in recent years has coincided with the most challenging phase of his career, but Karun Nair identifies “the end of 2022” as the darkest period he’s endured, calling it “quite a dark place. ” The 33-year-old’s return to the Indian Test team after eight years stands as a powerful testament to his resilience and determination.“In terms of incidents, I would say, it was quite a dark place at the end of 2022. Very emotional phase for me. I think the toughest time for me. Even tougher than 2018, or whatever, whenever that was,” Nair said during a conversation with R Ashwin on the latter’s YouTube channel.Nair, India’s only triple-centurion in Test cricket besides Virender Sehwag , is now on the verge of a remarkable comeback.On Friday, there's a strong chance he will be part of India’s playing XI for the first Test against England at Headingley, Leeds.Though he’s emerged stronger, Nair says he never wants to revisit that painful period when he struggled to understand why he was dropped from the Indian team shortly after scoring a historic triple century against England in 2016.“No. I don’t want to be where I was a couple of years ago, quite honestly.”He added, “I think at the moment, at least I am very grateful. Like you said, I have gotten past that complaining stage. Very grateful to be in the situation that I am and I just treat every day as something that's given to me, and I am living my life and doing what I love.“I am very grateful to everyone that has been part of my journey in the last 2-3 years at least. I have understood to value things. I have understood to value each moment and just treat every single day as a new day.”Nair admitted he was perplexed by the lack of communication when he was dropped from the Indian team.“Honestly, I couldn’t understand what was happening. Because after the 300 in Chennai, after the Australia series, I think the next series was in Sri Lanka in 2017.“I wasn’t part of that squad either. And from then on, I couldn’t understand what was happening. Then I had to go back in domestic cricket.”Looking back, Nair believes a strong performance against Australia could have secured his place in the side.“I had no clue what was happening. All I knew was my name wasn’t there. I couldn’t understand how it wasn’t there.“But if I look back and think that there is one side of me saying that ‘yes, I didn’t get too many opportunities’. But the other way I would also think is the four innings that I played against Australia, and I got a couple of starts.“If I had just converted those starts into bigger scores, maybe I wouldn’t be in this position or had to have gone through that.”Asked about his mindset during that difficult phase, Nair recalled: “Just figuring out how I should go about things and what I should be doing.“Obviously, I was a lot younger at that time and couldn’t probably control what was running in my head like I am able to do today. So, basically, just a confused mind and was trying so hard to get back that I think I just kept getting worse.“But I had a great season that year in domestic cricket and I was able to come back like I said in the 2018 season. And then again, went back there. Didn’t have too many opportunities.”While out of the Indian side, Nair said the support he received from his state team, Karnataka, was invaluable.“I think there has always been a great bond between the players in Karnataka. Because we all played together from a very young age. And all of us made the grade at the same time, if I can say that.“So, there was always support. There was never anyone, you know, lacking that support. They have always said good things. They always knew the player that I was. So, I always had the trust from the players in the Karnataka team at least.“So, to go back there, it again felt like a family. And obviously, it didn’t have a great season. But that happens to anyone, I would think. And yeah, it’s just everyone felt or everyone supported me.“Like I said, it’s like a family. And everyone was caring. And they never put any undue pressure on me in terms of, ‘oh, I wasn’t scoring’ or no one really came up to me,” Nair said.",Karun Nair says he was in a 'dark place' at the end of 2022.

A modern celebrity couple under the microscope of public and media pressure





In a decision that’s sparking conversation across the sports world, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has reportedly delayed his return to team training following his attendance at a wedding celebration with global pop icon Taylor Swift . Instead of heading straight back to Kansas City, Kelce remained in Florida, choosing to extend his time with Swift after the couple’s recent public appearance at the high-profile event.While the NFL offseason workouts are voluntary, Travis Kelce’s absence didn’t go unnoticed. In a league built on discipline and relentless preparation, even a brief deviation from routine draws attention—especially when it involves one of the NFL’s most visible stars and his relationship with one of the world’s most famous entertainers. This choice, though personal, mirrors a growing trend among elite athletes prioritizing mental wellness and personal milestones alongside their professional grind.Some fans have welcomed Travis Kelce's move. “He’s earned the right to take time for himself. The man’s been an ironman for the Chiefs,” one supporter commented on X (formerly Twitter). Yet others question whether his continued focus on his high-profile relationship may begin to interfere with team cohesion and performance—especially as the Kansas City Chiefs gear up to defend their Super Bowl title.Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are not just a couple; they’re a cultural moment. Every public appearance, comment, and decision feeds into a narrative that fans devour. Their relationship has fueled massive headlines, from luxury date nights to joint vacations, and now, Kelce’s extended break post-wedding. This latest episode adds to the speculation: how much will their bond influence Kelce’s football future?What does it mean to be a professional athlete today? For Kelce, stepping back from training isn’t necessarily about slacking—it’s about recognizing the value of personal joy amidst a pressure-cooker career. “It’s not always about the playbook,” one NFL insider said. “Sometimes, it’s about being present in your own life.”Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce spark fan frenzy after mysterious wedding table placement at NFL star Cole Kmet’s lavish ceremony As the Chiefs prepare for the season ahead, all eyes will be on whether the star player, Travis Kelce, can strike the right balance between gridiron greatness and his growing off-field legacy.","Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has reportedly delayed his return to team training following his attendance at a wedding celebration with Taylor Swift.

Joe Burrow, one of the most popular and talented players in the league, has finally opened up about Trey Hendrickson’s situation with the Cincinnati Bengals.

Tom Brady has turned heads once again—this time for a dazzling family moment. During Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, the NFL legend gifted his son, Benjamin, a $3 million Jacob & Co.

The moment wasn’t just about wealth—it was about legacy, emotion, and fatherhood.In a video that quickly went viral, Brady surprised his 15-year-old son during a quiet moment. “Close your eyes… put your wrist out,” he says, carefully placing the watch on Benjamin’s wrist. He then hugs the teen and adds, “I love you, buddy.” The emotion was visible on both sides.

A potential blockbuster trade involving Mikal Bridges could bring Grizzlies superstarto Madison Square Garden.The New York Knicks came agonizingly close to the NBA Finals this season, losing to the Indiana Pacers in a hard-fought series.

Reports suggest the Grizzlies may be open to trading him as they pivot toward a rebuild after dealing Desmond Bane to the Orlando Magic.According to ClutchPoints’ Kris Pursiainen, the Knicks have long been interested in Jackson Jr.: ""Sources familiar with the situation tell ClutchPoints that at least one key member of the Knicks' front office has long been interested in Jackson Jr. as a trade target."" (H/t: Sporting News)To acquire Jaren Jackson Jr., the New York Knicks would likely need to part with Mikal Bridges, a key two-way player. The Grizzlies previously offered four first-round picks for Bridges in 2023, signaling their high valuation of him.Pursiainen outlines a possible deal:- Knicks Receive:- Jaren Jackson Jr.- Vince Williams Jr.- John Konchar- Grizzlies Receive:- Mikal Bridges- Mitchell Robinson- 1 first-round pick- 3 second-round picksAt just 25 years old, Jackson Jr. is coming off his best offensive season, averaging:- 22.2 points- 5.6 rebounds- 2.0 assists- 37.5% from three on 5.3 attempts per gameDefensively, he remains a force, leading the league in blocks twice and earning three All-Defensive Team selections. His ability to stretch the floor and protect the rim would make him an ideal fit next to Towns.While Bridges has been a reliable scorer and defender for the Knicks, Jackson Jr.’s upside might be too good to pass up. His arrival would give New York a championship-caliber trio, positioning them as serious contenders in what should be a wide-open Eastern Conference next season.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to bag 6-feet-8 Portlan Trail Blazers big man and form Big 3 with Luka Doncic and LeBron James; key trade asset a bold choice?

Shohei Ohtani returns to the mound after a long layoff

BREAKING: Shohei Ohtani to Make Dodgers Pitching Debut Monday vs. Padres! Details Revealed!

Dodgers banking on Shohei Ohtani’s two-way magic





At last, the big night has arrived. Shohei Ohtani's pitching debut in a Los Angeles Dodgers uniform, and the energy to be this evening is palpable in the clubhouse. Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw summed it up perfectly in a chat with Los Angeles Times reporter Dylan Hernández: “I think we all are (hyped for Ohtani’s debut). I think as fans of the game and just seeing him day in and day out get ready to pitch and do both, it’s going to be really fun, whether it’s one inning or whatever it is.”Shohei Ohtani has been just a hitter since he had elbow surgery last year, but it is anticipated that Ohtani will pitch a short outing, perhaps only an inning, against the San Diego Padres, his first time on a mound since June 6, 2022, when he was still batting and pitching at the same time. This will be Ohtani's first pitching game in almost 22 months.Shohei Ohtani last pitched in a Major League game in August 2023 while with the Los Angeles Angels. He has since fought through injury and recovery, fighting months of rehab and bullpens to regain strength. He cleared a major hurdle just this past week, when he threw 44 pitches in a simulated game.Especially now with the Dodgers' organization in the midst of an unprecedented injury crisis (14 pitchers on the injured list, including top-of-the-rotation starters Blake Snell and Tyler Glasnow), Ohtani's return would be providing more than just hope.It might only be one inning tonight, but this is as much a boost for the team as it is symbolic and strategic.Manager Dave Roberts explained that in the current situation, where the rotation is thin on the roster, Ohtani’s pitching is essentially ‘additive.’ It was, of course, in the middle of another stellar offensive season for Ohtani, which has continued unperturbed. He leads the National League in home runs (25), OPS (1.035), and slugging at the moment. His bat remains in midseason form.Also Read: Shohei Ohtani to make long-awaited Dodgers pitching debut against Padres on Monday The Dodgers gain a level of roster flexibility that few teams could achieve, considering that Ohtani would likely suit as a designated hitter and pitcher in the same game.

It will be his first pitching game in almost 22 months. Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw said the team is hyped for the debut.

Tyrese Haliburton’s candid take on LeBron ’s pre-game vibe

What Sopranos does for LeBron James before tip-off





One of the most experienced and thoroughly examined players in NBA history, LeBron James always appears to have a trick up his sleeve. Fans and teammates alike keep wondering, how does the 40-year-old superstar stay so composed? As the weight of the Finals increases, everything is getting more and more intense. At a time like this, James , surprises everyone just as they thought they understood him with something unexpected before Game 5, causing the room to quiet down and be a little amused.As the Lakers prepared for Game 5 of the NBA Finals, LeBron James, 40, was spotted in the team’s morning shoot-around training room. He wasn’t watching game film or studying stats. LeBron was lying back at the Lakers’ training spot in Los Angeles in the morning. He had his iPad resting on his chest, playing The Sopranos out loud, no earbuds, just watching it like he was at home.Tyrese Haliburton said, “LeBron will do some old sh*t. We’re sitting in the training room, he’ll have his iPad on his chest watching ‘The Sopranos’, no headphones…”Even in a time of immense pressure, LeBron chose comfort and familiarity. It shows how he stays grounded: not always buried in analytics or drills, but also leaning on routines that help him stay sane during big moments.Not even someone like LeBron James is immune to stress; no NBA star is. Downtime is crucial when every shot, play, and approach counts in the Finals. Selecting a show like The Sopranos, noted for its intelligent dialogue and intricate characters, provides a means to disconnect and restart rather than just enjoyment.LeBron’s comfort moment also shows leadership by example. Younger players see him chill and know that rest and mental balance matter just as much as work ethic. It sends a message: training is crucial, but mental rest is equally vital.LeBron James has long spoken about his routines: stretching, journaling, and now TV breaks, that help him maintain this peak level at 40. Viewing him lean on something as basic as an old television show could simply be the reminder the team has been looking for.This guy clearly knows how to prepare, perform, and turn off when necessary as the Finals get under way.Also Read: “Missed You More Babes” - WNBA star Caitlin Clark’s comeback gets wild after post-game hug with Aliyah Boston","Tyrese Haliburton exposes LeBron James’ wild game day habit before NBA Finals.

Kendrick Perkins sparks uproar with halftime criticism of Tyrese Haliburton’s injury



Kendrick Perkins faces fan fury for blasting injured Haliburton during NBA Finals Game 5







Game 5 of the 2025 NBA Finals at Paycom Center in Oklahoma City delivered more than just on-court drama. It gave fans a moment of concern—and outrage. When Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton limped to the locker room in the first quarter with visible discomfort in his right calf, the situation was already tense. But what truly ignited social media? Kendrick Perkins’ blunt criticism of Haliburton’s performance and his suggestion that the All-Star guard was “playing scared.” The backlash from fans online was swift and unrelenting. Tyrese Haliburton exited the floor late in the first quarter on Monday night, June 16, visibly limping. Though he returned to the court early in the second, ESPN’s Kendrick Perkins didn’t hold back during the halftime broadcast.“Sit him down,” Perkins said on national TV. “Sit him down because I don't want to hear anymore excuses.”The former NBA center wasn’t done there. Still addressing Haliburton’s performance, Perkins continued: “If you're on the floor, you need to produce. Because this is the NBA Finals and this is Game 5.”He concluded by accusing Haliburton of being passive, saying, “He's going east-to-west instead of north-to-south.”That commentary, delivered live from the halftime desk, didn’t sit well with NBA fans—especially given the nature of Haliburton’s injury. Many pointed out that calf strains can be serious and have even preceded career-altering Achilles injuries.As soon as Perkins’ remarks aired, fans lit up X in defense of Haliburton—and aimed the analyst’s own NBA legacy.One user clapped back by highlighting Perkins’ own underwhelming Finals stats:“I would pipe down,” basketball journalist Ahmar Khan wrote, posting Perkins’ NBA Finals numbers alongside his quote.Another user shut down the idea of a “narrative” altogether, crediting Haliburton for carrying Indiana to the Finals:“Man F*CK the narrative. The only reason people think there’s a narrative is because Kendrick Perkins of all people is talking to us. Tyrese Haliburton carried a team to the Finals off of clutch plays… I don’t need anyone to tell me what I saw.”One user poked fun at ESPN’s chaotic halftime coverage with a sarcastic scenario:“And now we take you to the ESPN halftime show where Kendrick Perkins and Stephen A Smith are yelling over each other about why Tyrese Haliburton should be benched for the remainder of the game.”Another called out the dangerous precedent of criticizing players fighting through injury:“KENDRICK PERKINS on national TV saying Tyrese Haliburton is playing soft and he doesn’t wanna hear excuses when he has a calf strain and we’ve seen 3 All-NBA players’ Achilles obliterate because of calf strains and playing on them… pls get these people off my TV man.”And one summed up the absurdity of the segment, dragging both Perkins and Stephen A. Smith in one shot:“Kendrick Perkins saying Tyrese Haliburton is scared & Stephen A mistakenly saying he’s glad Tyrese has an injury completely sums up the stupid that is on that Halftime Show.”Also Read: “Dumb and Dumber” — Indiana Pacers fans trolling ESPN analysts Stephen A.

Patrick Mahomes’ precision practice puts NFL on alert



Rice returns from injury stronger than ever

Chiefs’ receiver corps loaded and dangerous





The Kansas City Chiefs are wasting no time sending a message to the rest of the NFL. Just months removed from a narrow Super Bowl LIX loss, Patrick Mahomes and the offense are back at work and sharper than ever. With Mahomes operating at full throttle and wide receiver Rashee Rice fully recovered from injury, the defending AFC champions are on a mission – dominate 2025.During a recent OTA session, Patrick Mahomes went a perfect 9-for-9 in a team period. He connected seamlessly with Rashee Rice (3), Skyy Moore (2), Xavier Worthy, Elijah Mitchell, Tyquan Thornton, and Noah Gray. It was a crisp, controlled display that felt more midseason than spring camp. The tone is clear, Kansas City isn’t easing in, they’re coming full force.“It kind of shows the standard that we have here. We’ve been doing it all throughout this spring. As guys are working hard, you can tell they’re motivated to go out there and be even better this next year. So it starts here and I think guys understand that,” Mahomes said, clearly confident about the team’s internal drive.While the team’s WR depth is drawing buzz, Rashee Rice is the standout of offseason chatter.After going down in Week 4 last season with a hamstring and LCL injury, Rice is now moving without restrictions. His recovery came early enough to allow a full offseason of training, including sessions with Mahomes in Dallas. He’s not just back – he’s faster, sharper, and laser focused on domination.“Obviously having the injury, it sucked. But happening so early in the season, he was back like right when the offseason started,” Mahomes added. “He was up here working hard, extremely hard. He was back home working extremely hard. And so I was throwing with him in Dallas a little bit and then getting him back out here. And there are no limitations. He’s out there playing… He’s explosive.”With rookie Xavier Worthy now in the mix, the Chiefs’ receiving unit is deeper and more dynamic than ever. But Rice isn’t worried about sharing the spotlight, he’s embracing the depth and the chance to shine. He knows the expectations are sky-high in Kansas City, and he’s ready to match that energy. The countdown to kickoff may still be ticking, but the confidence is already explosive.“We got a lot of guys. We deep in depth into the wide receiver group. We’re going to be explosive this year. We’re just excited to put on a show, to be honest. We know it’s gonna be a show. The only thing in the way right now is time, so we’re just waiting patiently.”Also read: Patrick Mahomes’ Messi moment sends fans buzzing as Chiefs tease World Cup role If spring workouts are already this electric, the rest of the league should be watching closely. The Chiefs aren’t nursing a Super Bowl hangover—they’re fueling a revenge tour.

Evaluating Jerami Grant’s Fit

Matisse Thybulle’s Defensive Impact

Risks for the Los Angeles Lakers





The’ blockbuster trade for Luka Dončić last season didn’t translate to playoff success, as the team managed just one postseason win. With defensive gaps exposed, the front office could explore a major offseason move—shipping out fan favorite Austin Reaves for Portland Trail Blazers and defensive ace Matisse Thybulle.After acquiring Dončić at the 2025 trade deadline, the Los Angeles Lakers struggled defensively, particularly on the perimeter. Rui Hachimura was their only reliable athletic wing, leaving Luka Dončić and the aging LeBron James vulnerable. General Manager Rob Pelinka might see a deal for Jerami Grant and Thybulle as a way to balance the roster.As Dean Simon of Sporting News noted in the original report: ""Los Angeles could have used another athletic wing outside of Rui Hachimura to assist the slow-footed Dončić with his defensive assignments on the perimeter.""For the deal to work financially, the Los Angeles Lakers would need to package Reaves with three other players:- Gabe Vincent- Maxi Kleber- Shake MiltonThis would offset Grant’s $36.4 million player option (if exercised) and Thybulle’s contract.Jerami Grant had a down year in Portland, but his career 36.4% three-point shooting and switchable defense make him an intriguing target. Injuries (47 games played) and the Blazers’ losing season (36-46) likely contributed to his struggles. For the Lakers, he’d provide:- Floor-spacing for Dončić and James- Versatile defense against bigger wings- Experience in high-pressure situationsWhen healthy, Thybulle is among the NBA’s best defenders. His 2024-25 season was cut short by an ankle injury, but his 15-game sample was stellar:- 5.1 defensive box plus-minus (elite)- 2.2 steals per game- 43.8% from three (career-high)His ability to lock down guards and wings would immediately upgrade L.A.’sperimeter defense.1. Grant’s Contract: His $160 million deal could become an albatross if his play declines.2. Thybulle’s Health: He’s missed significant time in three of his six NBA seasons.3. Losing Reaves: A homegrown talent with clutch scoring ability and chemistry with LeBron.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Dallas Mavericks might sign $29,936,173 Indiana Pacers to bolster squad; Mykes Turner key trade asset? This trade would address the Lakers’ defensive woes but comes with financial and health risks. Pelinka must decide if Grant’s scoring and Thybulle’s defense outweigh Reaves’ upside and affordability. With the offseason trade market heating up, this could be a move to watch.","The Los Angeles Lakers struggled defensively last season, particularly on the perimeter.

Instead, Ben Tenzer, a Denver Nuggets veteran front-office member with over 15 years of experience and a strong background in salary cap expertise, was named interim GM. Tenzer also serves as GM of the Nuggets’ G League affiliate, the Grand Rapids Gold, and is considered a leading candidate for the permanent GM role.The Nuggets owner, Josh Kroenke, has taken an active role in the front office during this transitional period, serving as interim president of basketball operations and overseeing the search for a new GM.
