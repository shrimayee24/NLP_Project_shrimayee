Arriving on your previously scheduled appointment date will result in your being denied admittance to the Consulate,"" the message said.Social media users said the clarification from the embassy was vague as applicants are left in a lurch, as they don't know what to do until March, and whether their companies in the US will allow them to remain in India till March.A Redditor said the appointment rescheduling will end the career as the US employer would not allow to work remotely. ""I am stuck in India, have biometrics this week. I used all my leaves to come for stamping. My employer cannot allow me to work remotely.

Dewald Brevis offered some resistance with 22 runs, but the Indian bowling unit, led by Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah , Varun Chakravarthy, and Axar Patel, dismantled the opposition, each picking up two wickets. Hardik and Shivam Dube claimed one each. The all-round performance earned Hardik the Player of the Match award, as India took a 1-0 lead in the five-match series.However, more attention than the match itself has been drawn to former India cricketer and commentator Aakash Chopra , who took playful pot shots at Pakistan opener Sahibzada Farhan .During South Africa’s innings, when the team were 28/2 in the fourth over, Bumrah bowled a good-length delivery on the last ball after Aiden Markram had smashed a six.Commentating at the time, Chopra said, “Bumrah ko chhakka maarna itna aasaan nahi hota. Kabhi lag jaaye to kuch log documentary bana lete hain [It’s not so easy to hit Bumrah for a six. If someone manages to do it once, some people even make a documentary on it].”Watch the video here The remark, delivered without naming anyone, clearly referenced Sahibzada Farhan, who had hit Bumrah for sixes during the Asia Cup T20 2025.Farhan had even shared a clip of a documentary made on his innings after Pakistan lost to India in the final, making him a target for Chopra’s humorous dig.The commentary clip has gone viral, with fans praising Chopra’s wit.The second T20I between India and South Africa will be played on December 11 in Mullanpur.","India beat South Africa by 101 runs in the first T20I at Cuttack.

What we know about Sherrone Moore’s firing



Sherrone Moore’s swift fall from one of college football’s most respected sidelines has stunned the Michigan community. The former Wolverines head coach, once celebrated for guiding the team through high-pressure moments, now faces a storm of allegations and uncertainty. His dismissal came only hours before police in Saline, Michigan confirmed he had been detained, adding another layer of tension to a day already marked by upheaval.The sudden collapse of Moore’s tenure unfolded at a pace that left players, fans and analysts scrambling for clarity. Accusations of an “inappropriate” relationship with a staffer triggered an internal investigation at the university, and the outcome was severe. While officials have not shared the specifics, the decision to terminate him with cause and hand the matter to law enforcement points to a situation far more serious than anyone inside the program expected.The University of Michigan released a series of statements outlining the reasons behind Moore’s dismissal, though key details remain concealed. “U-M head football coach Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately,” the school wrote, adding that “credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member.”The university emphasized that “this conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and U-M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior. ”Hours after the firing, the City of Saline Police Department confirmed Moore’s detention. “The City of Saline Police Department assisted in locating and detaining former University of Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore,” the department said. “Mr. Moore was turned over to the Pittsfield Township Police Department for investigation into potential charges.” The nature of the incident that required police action has not been disclosed.With Moore out, Michigan moved quickly to stabilize the program. Veteran assistant and former Charlotte head coach Biff Poggi was appointed interim coach, stepping into the role for the second time this year after previously filling in during Moore’s suspension stemming from the sign-stealing scandal.Moore’s exit closes a chapter that once held enormous promise. Hired in 2018, he climbed through the ranks, helped engineer the team’s championship season in 2023, and made history as Michigan’s first Black full-time head coach. His record stood at 18-8, and he had three years left on a contract worth more than six million dollars for the upcoming season. The firing for cause means the university avoids paying his multi-million-dollar buyout.Michigan now begins its search for a permanent successor at a moment of turmoil, entering an already crowded and fast-moving coaching market with more questions than answers.Also Read: Travis Kelce erupts in expletive-filled rant as Chiefs’ fading playoff hopes push simmering retirement rumors louder","Sherrone Moore was fired with cause by the University of Michigan.

Could Caminiti Challenge for the No. 1 Overall Pick?

What Landing Caminiti Would Mean for the Chicago White Sox’s Rebuild

Caminiti’s Rising Momentum as Draft Boards Finalize

As the 2025 MLB Mock Draft conversation intensifies, a Chicago White Sox rumor has zeroed in on one name:, the talented left-handed pitcher from Saguaro High School in Arizona. With the White Sox holding the No. 2 overall pick, league insiders increasingly believe Caminiti has become the franchise’s preferred selection as draft momentum builds.Cam Caminiti’s stock continues to soar thanks to a fastball already touching the upper 90s, a sharp swing-and-miss slider, and a highly projectable frame that hints at even more velocity growth. Scouts regularly compare his early profile to past top-10 MLB arms, citing his poise, athleticism, and ability to overpower hitters. His slider frequently earns plus grades, and analysts expect his fastball metrics to climb as he adds strength.Chicago’s interest aligns perfectly with the organization’s longstanding blueprint of investing heavily in high-octane left-handers. From Chris Sale to Carlos Rodón to Garrett Crochet, the White Sox have a track record of doubling down on elite pitching traits. Caminiti fits that mold: frontline upside, premium strikeout potential, and significant developmental runway.With Chicago’s revamped, data-driven pitching infrastructure, evaluators believe the club is well-positioned to maximize Caminiti’s ceiling.While some MLB teams prefer the dependability of college pitchers, the White Sox appear committed to upside over polish in this draft cycle. Caminiti’s youth and trajectory give him one of the highest long-term ceilings in the entire class. His delivery, raw stuff, and makeup align with what Chicago now prioritizes under its mechanics-focused development model.There remains mild speculation about whether Caminiti could sneak into contention for the top overall pick, but most insiders expect the Colorado Rockies to target a position player, likely Konnor Griffin. If that holds, Chicago will effectively have the first choice among pitching prospects, placing Caminiti firmly in their sights as the favorite at No. 2.Selecting Caminiti would signal a definitive commitment to rebuilding through elite pitching talent. The White Sox have struggled in recent years to develop sustainable rotation depth, making a potential future ace extremely valuable. Adding a high-octane arm through the 2025 MLB Mock Draft could reshape the organization’s long-term pitching outlook.Also read: MLB mock draft: Colorado Rockies emerge as favorites for $6,216,600 Pittsburgh Pirates prep star as #1 pick As scouting departments lock in their evaluations, Caminiti’s connection to Chicago only strengthens.

Sidney Crosby’s future ignites debate after anonymous poll exposes three teams players secretly expect him to play for next,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/sidney-crosbys-future-ignites-debate-after-anonymous-poll-exposes-three-teams-players-secretly-expect-him-to-play-for-next/articleshow/125900631.cms,"Sidney Crosby’s future (Imagn Images)

Top teams Sidney Crosby could play for next



Hockey fans love a good mystery, and few topics stir more curiosity than Sidney Crosby’s future. A new anonymous poll among NHL players has given that conversation fresh life. The answers reveal a clear theme. While the league changes fast, most players still believe Crosby will choose stability over spectacle. The poll, conducted by The Athletic with 120 participants, asked players where they think Crosby will play next. The responses hint at loyalty, superstition, and admiration that stretch far beyond Pittsburgh.The numbers lean heavily toward one conclusion. Nearly every player believes Crosby is still tied to the city he has called home since his first NHL shift. A non-Penguins player summed it up by saying, ""He's been a Penguin for all his career. Riding it out and playing all his years there, that would be a special moment for him."" That sentiment echoed again and again, building a picture of a superstar whose identity feels inseparable from his team.Players described Crosby with words that paint him as someone who values routine and long-term bonds. One said, ""I think he's a pretty loyal (guy) and seems like a guy who's going to spend his whole career in one place.""Another added that even though legends sometimes finish their careers elsewhere, Crosby’s steady nature makes him different. Some pointed to his habits, saying he “seems like a pretty superstitious guy,” which only strengthened their belief that he won’t pack up and move.Others made their opinions even more direct. ""I think Crosby is a Pen for life. I can't see him anywhere else."" Another added, ""I think he's extremely loyal."" One more said, «I think he finishes (his career) off in Pittsburgh.» A player even joked about his production with, ""And he'll probably score 100 points again. That seems like his going rate."" The idea that Pittsburgh would let him go felt unthinkable to some. ""They're not going to let him walk. They'd lose too many fans.""Still, the poll revealed two other teams that players see as realistic possibilities. Montreal came in second, a nod to Eastern Canadian roots and childhood fandoms. One player explained, ""If you grow up in Eastern Canada, you grow up a Habs fan, right? Just seems like Montreal would be an option."" Another admitted, ""I don't think Crosby will ever leave. But it would be Montreal if he did.""Colorado finished close behind, fueled by the idea of Crosby joining his close friend Nathan MacKinnon. As one player said, “To play with (Nathan) MacKinnon.” Another added that wherever Crosby ends up, he hopes ""it's a contender.""In the final tally, Pittsburgh earned 73.7 percent of the votes, Montreal 12.7 percent, and Colorado 11.9 percent. The results show how much respect Crosby holds in every dressing room. His future remains uncertain, yet the fascination around it remains one of the NHL’s most compelling storylines.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Quinn Hughes emerges as a stunning Penguins target as blockbuster deadline possibilities heat up again","Sidney Crosby's future remains one of the NHL's most compelling storylines.

Could Quinn Hughes be the missing piece for the Penguins as fresh reports tie him to a blockbuster deadline move?





The talk around Quinn Hughes has taken a sharp turn tonight as the Pittsburgh Penguins have suddenly entered the conversation with real weight. The idea of Hughes leaving Vancouver has been simmering for weeks, but this new twist has pulled fresh eyes onto a saga that already had fans and analysts buzzing. Instead of slowing down, the story keeps gathering speed, and the timing could not be more dramatic with the season settling into its rhythm.What once looked like a simple list of suitors now appears more complex after a report connected Kyle Dubas and the Penguins to the superstar defenseman. Elliotte Friedman mentioned Pittsburgh as a team to watch, and that hint alone has sent the hockey world scrambling. The possibility of Hughes landing in a city hungry for another championship has added a new layer to a developing storyline.The Penguins have played with a sense of purpose this season, and their strong start has created real belief that the window for another Stanley Cup is still open. That urgency has fueled talk that management might swing big. If the team plans to give Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin one more deep run, Hughes would be a dream fit. His elite skating and playmaking could lift an already determined roster into a true contender.Friedman suggested that Dubas is ready to push hard to make a deal. Pittsburgh holds a deep prospect pool and future first round picks that could help the Canucks begin a full rebuild. For Vancouver, a partner willing to offer both high-end youth and long-term draft capital would be difficult to dismiss, especially if they choose to reset their direction.The real test lies in whether Hughes is open to signing long term in Pittsburgh. If he prefers a different landing spot, Dubas would need to consider the risk of acquiring him as a rental player. That uncertainty will shape how aggressive the Penguins become as the deadline approaches.With the New Jersey Devils still seen as a major contender because of the family ties, Pittsburgh’s late entry has changed the tone of the race. The final stretch will reveal whether the Penguins can turn interest into a blockbuster move worthy of the spotlight.Also Read: “I look for transparency, but..."": Billionaire owner Michael Andlauer opens up with surprising honesty about Brady Tkachuk tampering saga","The talk around Quinn Hughes has taken a sharp turn tonight as the Pittsburgh Penguins have suddenly entered the conversation with real weight.

Meet Kelli Moore: Everything to know about Sherrone Moore’s wife after his shocking firing



Unexpected news has shocked University of Michigan football. Sherrone Moore, the Wolverines' head coach for just two seasons, was fired after it was alleged that he had a ""inappropriate relationship with a staff member. "" Fans, players, and the larger college football community were all taken aback by the December 2025 announcement. Athletic Director Warde Manuel confirmed the decision, stating, “U-M head football coach Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately. Following a University investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. This conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and U-M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior.”Moore’s departure has also turned attention toward his personal life, particularly his wife, Kelli Moore. Married since 2015, the couple has long maintained a balance between the high-pressure world of college football and a private family life. Kelli has mainly avoided the spotlight despite Sherrone's prominence in the sports world, giving their three daughters: Shiloh, Solei, and Sadie--a consistent presence.Curiosity about Kelli and her place in the Moore family has grown since the scandal has taken center stage in the media.Kelli Moore has quietly stood beside her husband through years of demanding seasons and public scrutiny. She and Sherrone tied the knot in July 2015 after he proposed in December 2014. Reflecting on their early years together, Sherrone shared a heartfelt tribute in 2018 on Instagram: “Happy three year anniversary to my life partner and best friend. So proud of you and all your accomplishments. I am so happy and blessed beyond measure to call you my wife as the man upstairs leads us to live through him. Love you soo much and excited about what the future holds for us! #skforevermoore #bestfriends #Lifegoalsmeet.”The couple shares three daughters: Shiloh, born in 2019; Solei, born in 2022; and Sadie, whose birthdate has not been publicly shared. Kelli has been a familiar figure at games, whether supporting Sherrone during his time with the Central Michigan Chippewas or cheering from the sidelines and stands at the University of Michigan. While she avoids social media limelight, friends describe her as devout, family-oriented, and deeply committed to raising their children in a values-driven home.The Moore family is currently under intense scrutiny. Sherrone's dismissal has caused a stir in college football, bringing Kelli's personal life into the spotlight. She must manage the fallout from her husband's career-altering controversy while providing stability for their young daughters as the couple nears their tenth wedding anniversary.

Quarterback Patrick Mahomes and player Travis Kelce struggled on the field. Brittany Mahomes, wife of Patrick Mahomes, remained silent on social media after the game. This quiet response mirrored the disappointment felt by many fans. The team's playoff hopes are now uncertain.

Kelce struggles, Mahomes takes heat, and Brittany distances herself from the chaos

Brittany Mahomes has never been shy about showing love for the Kansas City Chiefs, especially when her husband Patrick Mahomes takes the field at Arrowhead Stadium. From stadium arrivals to postgame celebrations, her Instagram is often filled with glam snapshots, family moments, and behind-the-scenes excitement. But Sunday’s matchup against the Houston Texans brought a different kind of energy and this time Britney chose not to post at all.After the Chiefs’ 20–10 defeat, the atmosphere among fans turned tense, and the blame quickly fell on both Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce for their lackluster performance. Instead of sharing her usual reactions, Brittany Mahomes went silent, leaving fans to interpret her disappointment without a word.Before kickoff, Brittany Mahomes seemed poised for another enthusiastic game day, sharing Instagram stories of the stadium buzz. Yet as the game unfolded, Kansas City Chiefs faltered early and never recovered. Kelce dropped late-game opportunities and the offense struggled to find rhythm, a shock to a fan base accustomed to polished comebacks. Once the loss was sealed, Brittany’s social feed suddenly stopped.No postgame thoughts. No family shots. Just silence.This isn’t the first time her online presence has mirrored the team’s emotional highs and lows. When the Chiefs win, Brittany often floods social media with celebration. But when they lose, fans get nothing at all, a silent statement that speaks louder than her usual hype. Making the night even more unusual, she also wasn’t seen alongside Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez, who attended separately in support of Travis Kelce.With this defeat, Kansas City Chiefs suffers more than a bruised ego. Their playoff hopes are now hanging by a thread, and for the first time in nine seasons, they’ve lost the AFC West crown, a title now held by the Denver Broncos. Their next game against the Chargers could determine whether their season lives or dies.As frustration among supporters rises, Brittany’s silence reflects what many Chiefs fans are feeling: uncertainty. The once-unstoppable dynasty suddenly looks fragile, and if Mahomes and Kelce don’t turn things around fast, the quiet moment on Brittany’s Instagram may be the least of Kansas City’s worries.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes sends a clear message to fans as they question Patrick Mahomes’ legacy during tough season","Brittany Mahomes has never been shy about showing love for the Kansas City Chiefs.

How Charlise Castro shaped her own career rather than being just a baseball wife

How George Springer and Charlise Castro's relationship grew through hard work and understanding

Charlise Castro’s life shows how identity and love can coexist for sports families

Charlise Castro’s life story reads far beyond the tag of being married to Toronto Blue Jays right fielder George Springer. She was a college standout long before she walked down the aisle, earning respect for her talent in softball and her later success in the wellness field. Her journey offers a look at how partners of elite athletes build their own paths while living in a world dominated by bright stadium lights and constant attention. Castro’s growth reflects ambition, resilience, and a firm belief that her identity deserves its own spotlight.Castro’s athletic journey began at the University at Albany where her strength at the plate turned her into a force in Division I softball. Her scholarship was earned, her achievements were celebrated, and her award as America East Player of the Year stamped her influence as one of the best young hitters in the country. Her selection to Puerto Rico’s national team only elevated her visibility, showing she could compete internationally. Yet her switch from professional play to personal development shows how she values reinvention over comfort.After graduating, Castro chose personal growth over lingering nostalgia for sport. She earned an MBA from the University of Saint Rose, taking her knowledge from the field into classrooms and business settings.That shift positioned her for a career in health, fitness, and wellness coaching where she could help others find confidence and balance. Her evolution showcases how athletes can turn discipline into leadership and passion into service.Castro has developed a quiet but credible space in the wellness world where she blends her business skills with lived athletic experience. Instead of promoting glamour without substance, she uses her platform to guide people toward stronger lifestyles. Even with Springer’s fame attracting followers, Castro’s work stands on its own credibility, supported by years of sport and education. She projects independence in a world where athlete spouses are often expected to stand behind.Castro first met Springer in 2011 when both were student athletes determining their futures. They bonded over long training days, competitive pressure, and goals that required sacrifice and patience. When Springer chased the majors, Castro chased academic achievement, creating parallel pursuits rather than one supporting role. Their connection deepened through understanding rather than dependency.The couple married in January 2018 in Newport Beach, California, in a setting suitable for two people balancing spotlight and family. The years since brought travel, clubhouse life, new homes, and eventually parenthood as they welcomed two children into the fold. Castro’s ability to nurture home life while working shows how she and Springer operate as a team, not as celebrity center and shadow. Their relationship reflects mutual ambition wrapped in family values.Today, Castro represents the changing narrative of partners in professional sports where wives create personal value instead of standing as silent figures on camera. Her athletic roots, career achievements, and steady role in Springer’s life make her part of his story without being overshadowed by it. Her journey is a reminder that balanced relationships in sports are built on choice, effort, and equal dreams. For George Springer, she remains his biggest supporter but also his truest match in drive and determination. Their story reminds everyone that shared ambition can build a lasting bond. It shows how two people can grow stronger when they move forward with the same purpose. It is this quiet understanding that makes their bond feel real and enduring always. And because of this, their relationship feels strong even in the toughest seasons together.Also read: Freddie Freeman and Ryan Reynolds’ SickKids video goes viral as fans explode with hilarious reactions online","Charlise Castro is the wife of Toronto Blue Jays right fielder George Springer.

Philip Rivers return sparks family excitement and concern



Philip Rivers Media Availability : Dec 10

Philip Rivers stepped back into the NFL spotlight this week, carrying the same competitive spark he once showed on Sundays. The difference today is the weight of time. The longtime quarterback, who recently celebrated becoming a grandfather, now prepares for a potential return with the Indianapolis Colts at 44. While fans view his comeback as a feel-good twist to a turbulent season, those closest to him feel the intensity of what lies ahead. His wife Tiffany senses the physical reality of the league he once commanded with ease.Rivers spoke with an honest tone as he fielded questions about the surprise signing. His words made it clear that football instincts never fade, but life off the field can shift priorities. The excitement inside his home mixes with nerves, especially for Tiffany, who has lived through every high and low of his career.Rivers, now on the Colts practice squad after Daniel Jones’ injury on Dec. 7, addressed the tension his return brings. He said, ""My wife has been my biggest fan the whole time I played, and she's nervous about the physical aspect of it, as you expect any wife to."" He later explained that injuries were always part of the job. ""I mean, for 250 games or whatever it was, that was a risk, as you see every week."" He added, ""Whether you're 24 in the best shape, or you're 44 and not so sure.Anything can happen.""Despite the unpredictable nature of the sport, Rivers told reporters that fear never controlled him. ""That has never been a concern of mine,"" he said. His mindset remains steady. ""Dudes are big and fast, just like they were, so I'm just taking it one day at a time."" He joked that if he did get hurt, ""I'd have a long time to recover.""His children, who range from toddlers to adults, are pushing him on with enthusiasm. Some barely remember his Chargers days. Rivers shared, ""My six-year-old asked, 'Dad, why don't you play anymore?'"" His sons, he said, are ""fired up"" but still ask, ""'Dad, do you think you can do it?'""Rivers insisted he retired peacefully after 2021 and enjoyed coaching at St. Michael Catholic High School, but the competitive fire lingered.

Carlie Irsay-Gordon and the Colts quarterback shake-up



The Indianapolis Colts walked into December looking like the feel-good surprise of the season. Now the mood around the team has shifted as three straight losses and the season-ending injury to quarterback Daniel Jones have forced a dramatic move. The sight of 44-year-old Phillip Rivers stepping back onto an NFL practice field created a swirl of curiosity. What made it more striking was team owner Carlie Irsay-Gordon standing on the sideline in an all-black outfit, watching every throw like someone determined to reshape her team’s fate.Rivers has not played since January 9, 2021, when the Colts lost a Wild Card game to the Buffalo Bills. He stepped away to focus on his family and help raise his ten kids while coaching high school football in Alabama. Seeing him back in a Colts helmet felt both nostalgic and surreal, but given the chaos at quarterback, it also made sense.The Colts have reached a point where they need solutions fast. Both Riley Leonard and Anthony Richardson are hurt, leaving the roster scrambling for stability. Rivers already knows Shane Steichen and the offensive system, so he was only a phone call away. The team signed him to the practice squad to evaluate him, and early signs show he still throws with the rhythm and power that once carried him past 60,000 yards and 400 touchdowns.His return became even more of a story when Irsay-Gordon arrived at practice in black gear with commando-style boots, almost like she was on her own scouting mission. Her presence was not for show. She has a reputation for being involved in every layer of football operations. She is also known for a line that people around the team still talk about. She once said she listens to play calls to learn where the team can improve, calling it a “scary micromanaging quote. ”At 45, the daughter of the late Jim Irsay has found her own leadership style. Fashion may get her noticed, but decisions like bringing in Rivers define her influence. If he takes the field Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks, the attention will shift from her outfit to the veteran quarterback who might get one more chance to save a season.Also Read: ""Off-balance and out of rhythm"": Is Patrick Mahomes the reason behind Chiefs' struggle?

Madison Beer reflects on long-standing mental health battles and how her bond with Justin Herbert feels different

Madison Beer: Blackmailed With My Nudes (Full Episode)

Madison Beer is entering a new chapter, one marked by emotional clarity, healthier relationships, and a willingness to confront the darkest moments of her past. In a powerful and vulnerable appearance on Alex Cooper’s Call Her Daddy podcast, the singer revisited the trauma she carried as a teenager when private photos of her were leaked online.The incident left her feeling isolated and exposed, fueling a belief that she “would die young” and pushing her toward two suicide attempts. Today, Madison speaks with a sense of healing she once thought she’d never reach, crediting her support system, including boyfriend and Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert , for helping her see life through a steadier, safer lens.During the conversation, Madison detailed the overwhelming shame and despair she felt when those images surfaced years ago. She explained that one of her attempts was directly tied to that moment, saying she had been unable to see a path forward.While she now views her life with more hope, she shared that she wishes she could go back and comfort her younger self, someone who desperately needed reassurance but had no idea how to ask for it.Her struggles, she admitted, didn’t stay confined to her teen years. Madison told Cooper that depression often seeped into her romantic relationships, leading to codependency and difficulty being alone.But something has shifted in her current relationship with Herbert. For the first time, she feels genuinely safe with a partner.She emphasized that she is with someone “who genuinely cares for her and someone she can truly trust,” a sentiment fans have noticed through their consistently low-key but supportive dynamic.Herbert, meanwhile, is navigating his own challenges on the field. Despite playing with a protected left hand following surgery, he led the Chargers to a gritty overtime win against the Eagles on December 8, helping the team secure second place in the AFC West.The quarterback’s resilience mirrors Madison’s emotional journey, two people rebuilding in different ways, yet aligned in their support for one another.Also Read: Justin Herbert and Madison Beer spark wedding buzz after ‘mother-in-law mode’ comment","Singer Madison Beer opened up about the trauma she felt when private photos of her were leaked online.

Jannik Sinner thanks Laila Hasanovic after Vienna win as he talks about love and balance in tennis

Jannik Sinner’s girlfriend, Laila Hasanovic, shared new Christmas photos from her Tommy Hilfiger campaign, and fans loved the warm, bright holiday look. Laila Hasanovic wore a simple black dress for the shoot and posted the pictures on Instagram. Her post came right after Jannik Sinner finished a long and tough tennis season in Turin. He missed the Year-End No. 1 spot by a very small margin, but he still won the ATP Finals by beating Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets.The couple has been together since mid-2025 and is often seen side-by-side at tournaments and events. They were also spotted at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix last week, which made fans smile because they rarely post much about their private life. Laila Hasanovic’s new photos came at a perfect time, as Sinner’s season ended with big wins and big emotions. Now, more people are talking about both his tennis and their growing bond.Jannik Sinner first spoke openly about his relationship with Laila Hasanovic after winning the Vienna Open. In that final, he had a tough fight against Alexander Zverev. Sinner went down a break early and said the start of the match was very hard for him.But he stayed calm and pushed himself to the end. After lifting the trophy, he thanked everyone who helped him during the event.He said, “It was such a difficult start in this final for me. I went a break down, had some chances in the first set but couldn’t use them. Zverev was serving very well, but I just tried to stick there mentally and play my best tennis when it came. To everyone here, my family, my girlfriend, my friends, and my whole team watching from home, thank you so much for your support.”Laila Hasanovic also cheered for him at the ATP Finals, making the season feel even more special. As Sinner grows as a champion, he is also learning how to balance his career and his personal life.In his interview with Vanity Fair in 2024 with writer Federico Rocca, Sinner said that it is not easy to keep a strong relationship because he travels so much. He explained, “Of course, it’s not easy. I travel a lot and during tournaments I’m very focused. But I think it’s a wonderful thing when you find the right love like everyone else.”He also said that many tennis greats have had families during their best years. He said, “And then, if you think about it, the best tennis players in the world all have wives and children.”Then he added a fun little detail about himself: “I’ve never been to a nightclub. I don’t like to stay up late. I prefer playing cards with a friend.”Now, Jannik Sinner will look ahead to the 2026 Australian Open, where he will try to win his third straight title.

Claire Tracy’s final TikTok posts show fear, pain, and deep loneliness



Rice University soccer player Claire Tracy, 19, shared very troubling TikTok posts only days before she was found dead near the Houston campus. Local reports say she was discovered on Sunday at an off-campus apartment complex two blocks from Rice University. Police and the school have not released any official cause of death.As friends and classmates try to understand what happened, people are looking at her TikTok page, which shows her final days. One post shows her taking part in a TikTok game called the “devil trend.” In this trend, she asked someone, a friend or maybe a chatbot, to answer a dark question. Many posts on her page also showed deep sadness, loneliness, and stress.Rice University confirmed her death in an email shared by Dean of Undergraduates Bridget K. Gorman, and her soccer coach and school president also paid emotional tributes. The school said she was a bright student, a kind friend, and a talented athlete from Wisconsin.In one TikTok message, Claire Tracy wrote, “I’m doing ‘the devil’ trend on TikTok.” She explained the game step by step: “I will say ‘the devil couldn’t reach me,’ and you will answer, ‘he did.’Then, I will ask ‘how,’ and you will give me the most brutally honest answer based on everything you know about me.”She also showed the answer she received. It said:“Because you did the work for him. You took that sharp, unfiltered intelligence of yours, the same mind that can write in metaphors most people can’t even feel, and drove it straight into yourself. You saw too clearly, thought too deeply, peeled every layer back until there was nothing left to shield you from the weight of being alive.”This was not the only sad post on her page. In another TikTok video, she said, “I’m going insane at this point and I need to see if anyone else feels like me.”She also wrote that her “depression got so bad” that she started working on an investment banking project just so she “didn’t have to think.”Many of her posts talked about being lonely and struggling with being neurodivergent. She said she had a hard time with simple things like small talk. One day, she recorded herself at the gym on a Friday night and wrote,“When my mom asks why I’m at the gym on a Friday night alone again… my two friends aren’t free again so I’d go mentally insane if I didn’t workout for at least two hours.”Her classmates in Houston have been sharing memories of her since her passing. Local outlets reported that she was found in an apartment complex close to campus. Rice University shared an official message on its website. Dean Bridget K. Gorman wrote,“It is with deep sadness that I am writing to tell you that Claire Tracy, a second-year undergraduate student, passed away on Sunday.”She added that Claire came from Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, and was a strong student and a loved member of Wiess College.Claire’s soccer coach Brian Lee wrote,“The entire Rice soccer community mourns the loss of Claire Tracy. Our thoughts and prayers go to Claire’s friends and family and to the many current and former teammates, whose lives were impacted by Claire’s kindness. She will forever be in our hearts.”During his yearly address, Rice University President Reggie DesRoches also asked for a moment of silence. He said,“She was deeply connected to many students and known for her Rice spirit.”Her death remains under investigation, and no cause of death has been shared yet.Also Read: Anna Kournikova Vs Enrique Iglesias Net Worth In 2025: Tennis Star And Music Icon Wealth Compared","Claire Tracy, 19, was found dead at an apartment complex two blocks from Rice University.

A Rare Athletic Profile That Separates Konnor Griffin From the Field

Why the Colorado Rockies Are Viewed as the Perfect Fit for Konnor Griffin

Colorado’s Scouting Philosophy Points Toward Griffin

Other Contenders for the Top Pick

The 2025 MLB Mock Draft conversation has intensified as scouting departments finalize early big boards, and one name has separated himself from the rest:, the two-way prep standout widely regarded as the top all-around athlete in this year’s class. With theholding the No. 1 pick, industry insiders increasingly believe Griffin is the frontrunner to headline the draft.Konnor Griffin, a dynamic outfielder and shortstop from Jackson Prep in Mississippi, has long been considered the highest-upside player eligible in the 2025 MLB Mock Draft cycle. At 6-foot-4 with explosive athleticism, 70-grade speed, and a plus arm, Griffin possesses the type of rare tool set that scouts describe as “franchise-altering.” His power continues to develop, his defensive versatility is elite, and his makeup consistently draws high marks from evaluators.For the Colorado Rockies, the fit appears seamless. Colorado has frequently targeted premium athletes with advanced projection in recent drafts, and Konnor Griffin embodies that strategy more than any player in the class. His ability to play center field at a high level stands out, particularly in spacious Coors Field, where outfield range is a crucial team-building priority. Offensively, scouts rave about his bat speed and potential to grow into a 20-25 home run threat while maintaining top-tier defensive production.The Colorado Rockies’ scouting approach also aligns with this direction. Since embracing a long-term rebuild, Colorado has shifted focus toward acquiring dynamic athletes capable of impacting the game in multiple phases. Griffin not only checks those boxes but arguably presents the organization with its best opportunity in years to secure a future superstar.Still, the decision will be closely watched. While Konnor Griffin headlines most 2025 MLB Mock Draft boards, college arms such as Brody Brecht and high-upside prep lefties like Cam Caminiti are also under consideration. Yet the overwhelming expectation from insiders is that Griffin offers the safest blend of ceiling and floor, making him the ideal cornerstone for a franchise eager to redefine its competitive trajectory.Also read: MLB mock draft: Chicago White Sox strongly linked to $3.6 million ex-Atlanta Braves fireballing lefty at #2 As the draft approaches, the noise around Konnor Griffin to Colorado continues to grow louder.

Pros and Cons of a Mets–Tucker Marriage

Pros for the New York Mets

Cons to Consider

Why This Move Changes the Mets’ Entire Offseason

My Opinion On the Winners Across the Board

The’ 2025 offseason has spiraled into full-blown unrest, with franchise cornerstones Pete Alonso and Edwin Díaz walking out the door and fans pleading for a turnaround. The front office’s search for a reset has now zeroed in on Chicago Cubs outfielder Kyle Tucker, whose free-agency buzz has grown into the most plausible redemption swing left on the board. While not a traditional trade scenario, the Mets’ offseason moves and recent salary shuffling have created a sign-and-trade-like narrative, keeping Tucker at the center of New York’s winter chaos.Pete Alonso’s move to Baltimore and Edwin Díaz’s decision to join the Dodgers blew open New York Mets’ roster and public perception. As frustration mounted, Kyle Tucker quickly surfaced as the organization’s most realistic path to salvaging what has been labeled a horrendous winter. With Juan Soto already in the fold, pairing him with Tucker offers a level of star power the Mets have lacked since their postseason aspirations first unraveled.Unlike Alonso and Díaz, Tucker is a free agent after his stint with the Cubs. That eliminates a true trade market, but chatter around Brandon Nimmo and recent payroll-balancing moves has created a backdrop where a sign-and-trade structure feels possible.Nimmo’s previous move to Texas for Marcus Semien is already believed to reset the outfield calculus.Insiders project Kyle Tucker’s next contract around 10 years and $400 million, with opt-outs after year six. That number blows past his previous $16 million arbitration figure and signals the New York Mets’ willingness to correct their early-winter missteps with an aggressive, franchise-shifting offer.There is no traditional trade in play, but the Mets could move Nimmo’s money or package prospects to create room, effectively manufacturing the feel of a sign-and-trade. This aligns with their recent attempts to dodge luxury-tax complications while eyeing significant CBA shifts.• Tucker is a free agent; no prospect haul is required unless a sign-and-trade structure emerges• Mets need immediate star talent, not long-term development pieces• The Alonso and Díaz exits demand a big splash• Soto-Tucker pairing elevates Mets’ lineup instantly• Luxury-tax maneuvering becomes easier with an outgoing contract like Nimmo’sFor New York, the appeal is obvious. Tucker brings elite contact quality, reliable power, strong WAR output, and defense that anchors an outfield suddenly thin after losing Nimmo and absorbing a .240 team outfield OPS dip. His age also works in New York’s favor; at 28 (turning 29 in January), he’s entering his statistical prime.For Tucker, a move to Queens repositions him from an injury-hit stretch in Chicago to a major-market contender. The Cubs clear payroll, and other bidders like the Dodgers and Blue Jays simply pivot elsewhere. It is one of the rare big-money maneuverings where no party truly loses.Kyle Tucker’s production speaks for itself, even while battling injuries during his Chicago tenure. His 2024 numbers approached MVP levels, and his 2025 output remained strong across 136 games.The metrics reinforce his value as a consistent middle-order force and dependable defender. A 4.7-WAR output in just 78 games in 2024 hints at his ceiling when fully healthy.• High-end defense in right field• Left-handed bat pairs perfectly with Soto’s profile• Contact-power blend fits NL East pitching• Prime-age window supports a 2035 competitive arc• Front-office redemption amid public backlash• Replaces both star power and OPS production lost this winter• Injury history includes shin and hand fractures• Around $40 million AAV tightens payroll flexibility• Citi Field’s left-field dimensions may mute some of his pull power• Heavy long-term commitment after losing Alonso’s more predictable aging curveThe New York Mets still view the upside as overwhelming, especially given the organizational pressure to respond after losing two franchise pillars.A Tucker signing shifts the story from dysfunction to revival. It transforms a front office under fire into one that retained its aggression despite public scrutiny. For a team that has been criticized as the biggest disappointment in New York sports this year, the optics of a Soto-Tucker outfield erase the perception of surrender.This is not simply replacing Alonso or Díaz; it’s rewriting the offseason narrative altogether.• Mets stabilize their long-term core• Tucker secures a mega-deal and steps into a marquee market• Cubs gain payroll relief• Dodgers, Jays, and others redirect without significant lossEven in a hypothetical structure, the move creates the rare scenario where every party lands on its feet. For the New York Mets, though, the stakes are far higher. This isn’t just about adding an All-Star; it’s about rescuing an offseason that fans have labeled an embarrassment.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Chicago Cubs proposed to bag $6.5 million Washington Nationals All-Star to bolster squad and improve title odds If the Mets close on Kyle Tucker, they flip a disastrous winter into a defining moment. It recasts the franchise from reeling to reloaded and positions New York for a run that extends well into the next decade. In a market begging for hope, Tucker becomes the most impactful answer available.","Kyle Tucker is a free agent after his stint with the Chicago Cubs.

“She is jealous Charlie married Erika instead of her”: Laura Loomer blasts Candace Owens for attacking Erika Kirk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/she-is-jealous-charlie-married-erika-instead-of-her-laura-loomer-blasts-candace-owens-for-attacking-erika-kirk/articleshow/125900476.cms,"A public feud erupted between conservative personalities Candace Owens and Laura Loomer following Charlie Kirk's assassination. Owens criticized the slain activist's widow, Erika Kirk, for denouncing conspiracy theories, prompting Loomer to defend Erika and accuse Owens of jealousy. Authorities maintain a single suspect is in custody, yet the dispute highlights the increasingly personal fallout.

Laura Loomer defends Erika Kirk while slamming Candace Owens’ motives and theories about Charlie Kirk’s death







The fallout surrounding Charlie Kirk’s assassination has taken yet another dramatic turn, this time pulling two high-profile conservative personalities into a public feud. On December 10, Candace Owens used her podcast to criticize Erika Kirk, the CEO of Turning Point USA and widow of the slain activist, after Erika denounced the conspiracy theories swirling around her husband’s killing.Candace Owens suggested Erika had “missed the mark,” signaling yet another escalation in her long list of unproven theories that have pointed fingers at everyone from foreign intelligence agencies to the US military. But her comments did not go unchallenged. Conservative commentator Laura Loomer fired back almost immediately, igniting a new wave of tension within the right-wing media space.Erika Kirk had recently spoken out on Fox News, urging the public to stop amplifying conspiracies about her husband’s September 10 assassination at Utah Valley University. Her stance directly contradicted Owens, who has repeatedly floated dramatic and consistently unsupported claims since the shooting.Candace Owens addressed Erika’s remarks on her own show, saying she believed Kirk’s widow had “missed the mark,” but added the “good news” was that she finally had clarity about Erika’s plans for TPUSA moving forward.Ahead of the episode, Owens teased her followers on X with, “Erika Kirk GOES OFF on ‘conspiracy theorists’ (read: me)… And to be honest, it’s weird.”That post set the stage for what would become a heated exchange.Laura Loomer, who has criticized Owens multiple times in the past, responded forcefully. Sharing Owens’ post, she wrote, “As I have been saying, Candace Owens @RealCandaceO is jealous Charlie Married Erika instead of her.” She then urged Owens to back off, adding, “Hasn’t she suffered enough? This is ghoul behavior.”Loomer’s comments resonated widely, with many echoing the sentiment that Owens’ repeated accusations, none supported by evidence, were compounding the distress of a grieving widow. Owens has not directly responded to Loomer, but she continues to hint that she will release more “information” related to Kirk’s death.Meanwhile, authorities maintain that Tyler Robinson, currently in custody, is the sole suspect. As official investigations proceed, the public feud between Owens and Loomer underscores how polarized and personal the fallout from Kirk’s assassination has become.Also Read: Candace Owens intensifies controversy with new claims dragging Charlie Kirk’s security provider in new assassination claims","Conservative personalities Candace Owens and Laura Loomer are embroiled in a public feud.

Bengals weighing Shemar Stewart’s Week 15 availability

Shemar Stewart’s return arrives at a critical moment

Also Read:

The Cincinnati Bengals have received a much-needed boost on the defensive front as rookie defensive end Shemar Stewart has officially been cleared to return to practice. The update comes at a crucial moment for the 4-9 Bengals, who are attempting to regain momentum following Trey Hendrickson’s season-ending core muscle surgery.Stewart, the No. 17 pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, has been sidelined since Week 11 with a knee injury and spent the last four games on the Reserve/Injured list. The Bengals announced on Wednesday that he has been designated for return, beginning a 21-day practice window in which he can participate without counting against the active roster.Head coach Zac Taylor confirmed that Stewart has a chance to play this Sunday against the Baltimore Ravens, though no decisions will be made until after the team evaluates him during the week.“I saw him on the rehab field last week. He looked like he was making really good progress,” Taylor said. “Now it’s just get him out there and see what it looks like. Tomorrow we’ll probably get a better indication of what he looks and feels like.”While Taylor did not commit to Stewart’s immediate return, he acknowledged the importance of simply allowing the rookie to take incremental steps after a stop-start first season.The Bengals have already experienced one example of caution this year. Linebacker Shaka Heyward practiced fully for a week but was not activated from I.R. Taylor suggested a similar approach could apply to Stewart, especially given his limited NFL experience.Stewart’s first season in Cincinnati has been challenging. He has played only five games, logging 177 snaps with six tackles and a quarterback hit. Before his knee issue, an ankle injury in Week 2 sidelined him for four additional games.The Bengals’ defensive end group has been stretched thin following Hendrickson’s surgery. The team elevated Isaiah Foskey last week for depth, but Stewart’s return could strengthen the rotation immediately.If activated, Stewart would join a unit preparing to face a Baltimore offense currently leading the AFC North - an immediate test of his readiness as Cincinnati attempts to build late-season momentum.With four weeks remaining, the Bengals’ playoff hopes may be slim, but Stewart’s return offers a key developmental opportunity and a potential spark for a defense looking to finish strong.","Shemar Stewart has been sidelined since Week 11 with a knee injury.

Flames were seen rising from the garbage mound in the early hours of Wednesday, prompting hospital staff and authorities to take immediate action, and they doused the fire.In the morning, passersby noticed what appeared to be the burned remains of infants amid the charred waste. Koh-e-Fiza police were informed, and a team retrieved the remains around 1 pm. One of the newborns was burned nearly 90 percent, while the second was partially charred.Police said the infants were wrapped in plastic before being dumped. Burnt plastic was found stuck to their bodies, suggesting they were placed inside a plastic sheet or bag before the fire.A bedsheet was also found in the garbage, leading police to suspect the babies were wrapped in it before being discarded.Police are now working to determine whether the newborns were already dead when dumped or were burned alive. Post-mortem examinations will establish the cause and timing of death. Police have also requested DNA sampling to investigate possible links to recent deliveries or abandoned infants.CCTV cameras installed around the mortuary failed to provide helpful footage due to poor quality, hampering immediate identification of suspects. Both remains have been preserved in the mortuary for post-mortem, and a detailed probe is underway.","Two newborns were allegedly found burned in a heap of garbage.

Poll Should Xabi Alonso be given more time to turn Real Madrid’s fortunes around? Yes, he deserves support No, it's time for a change Only if results improve quickly

Manchester City delivered a dramatic comeback to beat Real Madrid 2-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday, a result that has pushed Xabi Alonso closer to the brink amid growing uncertainty over his future. Despite taking an early lead, Madrid’s frailties resurfaced and Pep Guardiola’s side capitalised, leaving the Spanish giants facing both a Champions League struggle and a coaching dilemma.Madrid, missing injured superstar Kylian Mbappe, began brightly and struck first through Rodrygo Goes, who ended a draining 33-game goal drought. The Brazilian finished a flowing counter-attack initiated by Alvaro Carreras, drilling low past Gianluigi Donnarumma after being played through by Jude Bellingham. Rodrygo’s celebration — embracing Alonso on the touchline — was a pointed show of support during what he later called “a difficult moment” for the squad and its manager.But the momentum flipped abruptly. City equalised in the 35th minute after Thibaut Courtois spilled Josko Gvardiol’s header, allowing Nico O’Reilly to pounce and tap home. The error punctured Madrid’s early rhythm, and frustration inside the Bernabeu grew as whistles rang out during a disjointed second half.City then struck again just before halftime. Antonio Rudiger hauled Erling Haaland to the ground inside the box, and the Norwegian made no mistake from the spot, sending Courtois the wrong way to give City a 2-1 lead they would protect until the end.Madrid continued to press for an equaliser but produced few clear openings. Courtois redeemed himself with sharp stops to deny Haaland, Rayan Cherki, and later Jeremy Doku, but the hosts lacked creativity and conviction. Alonso introduced 19-year-old Endrick late on, and the youngster nearly rescued a point when his effort clipped the crossbar with minutes remaining.Spanish media had widely reported that defeat would all but seal Alonso’s dismissal, and the atmosphere reflected those stakes. Madrid have now won just two of their last eight matches across competitions, slipping dangerously in the Champions League league-phase standings.Guardiola admitted City were second-best early on but praised his side’s resilience: “Until the goal we scored, they were much better.”Defender Raul Asencio insisted the dressing room remains behind Alonso, but with President Florentino Perez monitoring closely, Madrid could be headed for yet another change in the dugout.","Manchester City beat Real Madrid 2-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday.

Philip Rivers’ week 15 status takes center stage as Colts turn to veteran QB after Daniel Jones’ injury,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/philip-rivers-week-15-status-takes-center-stage-as-colts-turn-to-veteran-qb-after-daniel-jones-injury/articleshow/125894075.cms,"Philip Rivers’ status for week 15 (Image via: Getty Images)

Philip Rivers’ week 15 status: Will the Colts start the 44-year-old QB in Seattle?



The Indianapolis Colts have shocked the NFL by pulling 44-year-old Philip Rivers out of retirement after Daniel Jones went down with a season-ending Achilles injury. With the playoff race tightening and stability at quarterback slipping away, the Colts turned to a trusted veteran who already proved he can win in Indianapolis. Suddenly, Rivers is back in the building and potentially days away from returning to action.The biggest question heading into Week 15 is whether the former Pro Bowler will suit up against the Seattle Seahawks. Making a comeback at this stage of the season is rare, but the Colts’ situation might demand it. With a playoff berth still within reach, Indianapolis is evaluating just how quickly Rivers can get up to game speed.Rivers completed a private workout shortly after the Colts’ Week 14 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, and the front office liked what they saw. Impressed by his conditioning and familiarity with the system, the team signed him to the practice squad on Tuesday. Now, all attention turns toward how ready he is to take the field and whether he could start as soon as Sunday.As the team ramps up preparations for the Seahawks, the Colts continue to monitor everything from Rivers’ timing to his ability to re-adjust to NFL tempo.While nothing has been finalized, Indianapolis has made it clear they won’t hesitate to activate him if he proves capable of running the offense.Adding to the nostalgia of his return, Rivers will also reclaim his old jersey number. With Daniel Jones on injured reserve, the veteran quarterback will once again wear No. 17, the number he’s proudly represented throughout his entire career.Rivers’ history with Indianapolis gives him a strong head start. During his 2020 season with the Colts, he delivered steady and efficient play, completing 68% of his passes for 4,169 yards, 24 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. That performance propelled the team to an 11-5 finish and a playoff berth, ending in a narrow Wild Card loss to the Buffalo Bills before Rivers announced his retirement.Now, nearly five years later, Indianapolis is hoping his leadership and precision can once again bring stability at the most crucial point of the season. Whether he starts in Week 15 or soon after, Rivers’ comeback adds a dramatic twist to the Colts’ playoff push, and all eyes will be on Seattle to see if the veteran’s return becomes reality this Sunday.Also Read: Philip Rivers returns to NFL at 44 to join Indianapolis Colts amid quarterback shortage, reveals NFL insider","The Indianapolis Colts signed Philip Rivers out of retirement on Tuesday.

How Connor McDavid, J.T. Miller, and more are showing signs of decline in 2025

8 Minutes of J.T. Miller Highlight-Reel Plays

In this judgment, Father Time reflects on an NHL player’s performance evaluation between 2022-2025, taking into consideration The Athletic’s criteria of the player’s age (28–32), total period of no major injuries, and continuous decline in the statistics, as well as All-Star and contract of the players won’t weaken their case. This time, alongside Connor McDavid, Jordan Binnington, J.T. Miller, Filip Forsberg, and Linus Ullmark, analysts question whether the said stars’ stats reflect natural aging or just temporary troubles.Such cases are not really about panic, but rather they are pointing out some patterns in the related area of Usage, minutes, systems, and team performance. All these factors working together provide a clearer view of which players' struggles are only for a short time and which ones can be part of longer-term trajectories.It's J.T. Miller (Rangers) who is facing the most significant drop, going down from a 91-point pace in Vancouver to a 51-point projection this season. The Athletic mentions a decline in power-play production and fewer primary assists as major reasons for the decrease. His side, however, claims that Mikey Sullivan’s low-event system and his health problems are the main factors that affect his numbers. The judgment: there are indications of decline, but not enough to declare his high-end impact extinct.Jordan Binnington (Blues) comes into the picture with the lowest goals-above-expected number in the whole league. The prosecution brings forward various bad performances, while the defense states that St. Louis' issues and his historically over- and underperforming nature are factors contributing to the decline trend. The decision: significant drop, but still able to stabilize through a stronger second half.Connor McDavid (Oilers) surprises the most. Although the overall scoring is at the highest level, his 5-on-5 production is at the lowest in his career. The Athletic points out a consistent decline over the last five years in primary chances, shots, and possession metrics. His defense asserts that these circumstances are mainly due to heavy minutes and constant line rotations. The verdict: not an even-strength giant as before, but still very much a capable and top-level team.Filip Forsberg (Predators) seems to be the most affected player as he feels the negative impact of reduced power-play utilization and cannot find suitable words to explain the slowed-down bursts of speed. His defense claims that it is Nashville's weak power play that has been hindering his numbers from growing higher. The verdict: team-inflicted slow down rather than loss of personal skills.Linus Ullmark (Senators) has a tough time with his save percentage and is regularly caught in highly dangerous situations from which he will eventually get shot at. His camp is adamant that it is only a temporary setback. The ruling: the bar has been lowered, but still not so that one can’t hope for improvement.According to The Athletic’s ratings, the decline of any of these athletes is not necessarily by all means. There are some alarming signs that accompany each case, but allow for a recovery as well. The 2025 season is a decisive one—a comeback or giving Time That Father half a year of stronger proof next year.Also Read: Why was Max Domi left out vs. the Washington Capitals, and will he get another chance this weekend?","Connor McDavid, Jordan Binnington, J.T.
