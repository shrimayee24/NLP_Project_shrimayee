John Cena’s Santa cameo on Netflix blends WWE and NFL worlds just before Christmas Day games,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/john-cenas-santa-cameo-on-netflix-blends-wwe-and-nfl-worlds-just-before-christmas-day-games/articleshow/116662271.cms,"Image via Don Feria/AP

Netflix Promoting WWE Raw Through John Cena



Fans Are Frustrated With The Broadcast Quality Of The NFL Matches On Netflix



The NFL Christmas Day games have started on Netflix but before the NFL games started, Netflix dropped a surprising intro featuring the legendary John Cena which looks like a collaboration of the world of WWE and the NFL. John Cena appeared as a Santa Claus who was visibly stressed after reading a letter from the NFL. He also has a quirky reference where he talks about people calling him like “the beasty American wrestler” - a clear reference to WWE even though WWE is not mentioned anywhere in the intro video of Netflix’s.This shocking intro video which dropped just hours before the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Pittsburgh Steelers started, ended with a montage of the previous matches between the Kansas City Chiefs, Pittsburgh Steelers, Baltimore Ravens and the Houston Texans. There is also a mention of popular players like Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Lamar Jackson, and Russel Wilson at the end.Even though Netflix was clever with doing an intro with the legendary John Cena and not mention a word about WWE, along with being an introductory video to the NFL Christmas Day games which will be held today, it also looks like an introduction to the WWE Raw which Netflix paid $5 billion for its exclusive rights. Netflix will be streaming WWE Raw from the first week of January.But it was not just John Cena who was promoting WWE Raw, CM Punk was also seen on the field as the game between the Chiefs and the Steelers began. CM Punk expressed his excitement about the potential of football and wrestling on Netflix and how it can now reach out to a wider set of audience.But it is not all good news for Netflix. Netflix had a bit of a rocky start with the NFL Christmas Day games even before the match between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Pittsburgh Steelers began. Both Mina Kimes and Kay Adams’ audio was cut short or was not even audible. Many fans who bought the Netflix subscription solely to watch the NFL Christmas Day games are not very happy with this quality of broadcasting. Many fans have taken to X to express their frustration over the issue.Also Read: With Netflix’s NFL stream facing issues, here are the best alternatives for watching the Christmas games Earlier this year, the National Football League signed an exclusive deal with the streaming giant Netflix for the exclusive rights of the NFL Christmas Day games which includes two matches today - the match between the Pittsburgh Steelers going against the Kansas City Chiefs and the Houston Texans going against the Baltimore Ravens today at 4:30 PM ET. Famous global pop stars Beyonce and Mariah Carey will also be performing today during the half time of both the matches.","NFL Christmas Day games have started on Netflix but before the NFL games started, Netflix dropped a surprising intro featuring the legendary John Cena.

NFL's star treatment: Is Mahomes the next Brady?



Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes discuss Super Bowls, family & more ahead of 49ers-Chiefs rematch

Here’s what Tom Brady has to say about Patrick Mahomes

A game-changing roughing-the-passer call in the Chiefs-Texans matchup has sparked fierce debate. The penalty overturned a crucial fumble and gifted Patrick Mahomes 15 yards, leaving fans wondering if Mahomes is now receiving the same preferential treatment that once defined Tom Brady ’s career. The comparisons are undeniable, and the controversy is just getting started.NFL fans are feeling the weight of déjà vu after a controversial penalty in the Chiefs Texans game that seemed to favor Patrick Mahomes. The call, which reversed a fumble and awarded the Chiefs a 15 yard roughing the passer penalty, has sparked heated debates: Is Mahomes receiving the same treatment Tom Brady got throughout his legendary career? The whispers about questionable calls benefiting the league’s top quarterbacks are growing louder.This isn’t just about a single call, it’s part of a broader narrative. Look back at the 2022 Falcons Bucs game, where Brady benefited from a dubious roughing the passer penalty after a hard sack by Grady Jarrett. Critics quickly took to social media, accusing the refs of giving Brady preferential treatment. Or rewind to 2017, when the Steelers’ touchdown was ruled incomplete after a controversial call, which ultimately helped Brady’s Patriots secure the win.Now, with Mahomes in the spotlight and facing similar calls, fans are drawing comparisons to Brady’s career. Even Brady himself has recognized Mahomes as a rising star in the NFL. But amid this ongoing controversy, one question remains: What does Brady think about the latest buzz surrounding Mahomes and the Chiefs? Mahomes is now in the same conversation as Brady, for better or worse.During Saturday's FOX broadcast of the Steelers vs. Ravens game, seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady made some high praise for Patrick Mahomes, the three-time Super Bowl winner, as the AFC playoff race intensified. Brady is backing Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs over the rising Buffalo Bills and their star quarterback Josh Allen for a potential title run.“If it’s a close game, I’ll pick Patr͏ic͏k Maho͏me͏s ͏every tim͏e because he possesses that ͏champion͏s͏hip min͏dset,” Brady stated during the broadcast. With a commanding 14-1 record, the Chiefs have secured the top spot in the AFC and clinched their division. A win in their final two games would guarantee a first-round playoff bye. This season, Mahomes has thrown for 3,608 yards, ranking 10th in the league, with 23 touchdowns, 11 interceptions, and a quarterback rating of 91.2.This isn't the first time Brady has expressed admiration for Mahomes. Ahead of Super Bowl LVII, when the Chiefs faced the San Francisco 49ers, Brady welcomed comparisons between himself and Mahomes.There’s noth͏i͏ng͏ ͏Pa͏trick can do ͏tha͏t dim͏inishe͏s my ͏achievements, and ͏nothin͏g I did can ͏take a͏way from ͏what he is ai͏m͏in͏g͏ for,͏” Brady remarked.While Mahomes still needs four championships to catch Brady, should he reach that milestone, Brady will gladly welcome him. It will be fascinating to see if Mahomes can break any of Brady's records!Also Read : Beyoncé mocks Netflix glitch in a new promotional spot ahead of her NFL Christmas Day Halftime Show","NFL fans are feeling the weight of déjà vu after a controversial penalty in the Chiefs Texans game that seemed to favor Patrick Mahomes.

How are the hamstring muscles valuable for an NFL player?



Good news and Bad news!



Once the hamstrings are injured, an NFL player takes a long time to recover. But God had other plans for Dak Prescott.NBC reporter, Melissa Stark explained about his hamstrings, ""Dak tore his right hamstring Week 9. Ten days later, on November 13, he had surgery, and I caught up with him pre-game. He said he just got off the crutches last week.""Later, Melissa relieved the Dallas Cowboys' quarterback fans by sharing, ""He said he's about a month away from starting to run and really move,""Stark added, ""And right now, he's focussing on core and upper body strength and building muscle in that right leg. He was adamant he'll be fully ready for offseason workouts which start in April."" (via: On3 Media)Dak Prescott Instagram, Dak captions: Control the Controllables!An injury to a valuable NFL quarterback hurts like no other. Especially if it involves one of the largest muscles of the human body - the hamstrings. The hamstrings are one of the most crucial muscles in playing the NFL. Why? Because running a pitch of 120 yards in American Football is impossible without a strong set of hamstrings!The hamstrings play a crucial role in sprinting, making sudden changes in bodily directions, and executing vigorous leg drives, acceleration, and deceleration. They are also essential for making sharp cuts on the field and stretching extensively. Midway through the NFL 2024 season, Dak Prescott of the Dallas Cowboys had to bid goodbye to the field due to a hamstring injury. This injury significantly affected the team's performance and led to their early elimination from the season.Dak Prescott Instagram, Dak captions: From State to SundaysGood news: Dak Prescott will be back in April after recovering from his Hamstrings injury.

However, the team might have to manage if he feels any discomfort while fielding during the match.""I don't think you'll see too much management of him throughout the game. He just kind of plays as is.

“Absolutely ridiculous”: Keanu Reeves provided a humorous response to the rumor that the Ravens offered him a chance at quarterback,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/absolutely-ridiculous-keanu-reeves-provided-a-humorous-response-to-the-rumor-that-the-ravens-offered-him-a-chance-at-quarterback/articleshow/116522105.cms,"Keanu Reeves's portrayal of quarterback Shane Falco in ""The Replacements"" sparked a rumor about a Baltimore Ravens tryout. Reeves denied the rumor in an interview, though acknowledged the fun speculation. The film, loosely inspired by the 1987 NFL strike, achieved moderate box office success.

Keanu Reeves was once approached to try out for quarterback by the Baltimore Ravens

Keanu Reeves & Idris Elba Talk Shane Falco, Michael Jordan Movie & Auto Racing

A popular rumor suggests that Keanu Reeves became so good as a quarterback during the movie ""The Replacements"" that he got invited to try out for the Baltimore Ravens. It is indeed well-known that the internet can mix truth and gossip or fiction with claims like this. Most blended with this idea of Reeves trying out for an NFL team fit well with his reputation for hard work and intense preparation for his film roles.The Replacements is a 2000 sports comedy film directed by Howard Deutch and starring Keanu Reeves, Gene Hackman, Orlando Jones, Brooke Langton, Rhys Ifans, Jon Favreau, and Jack Warden in his last film appearance before his death in 2006. Reeves played Shane Falco #16 (QB) — A left-handed former All-America quarterback for Ohio State who fell off the grid after choking in the 1996 Sugar Bowl and washing out of the pros after one season, giving him a derogatory nickname of ""Footsteps"", because of his impulse to scramble prematurely when he thinks a sack is coming.Keanu Reeves' role in The Replacements, playing Shane Falco in 2000, was among the most defining moments of his illustrious career as an actor. In the film, Reeves was the quarterback for the Washington Sentinels, signed after a strike, as Falco is the quarterback needed by coach Jimmy McGinty, which played by Gene Hackman.In an interview with Sports Illustrated, Reeves together with Idris Elba discussed their upcoming movie, Sonic the Hedgehog 3, and talked about the rumors of an NFL try-out with the Baltimore Ravens after playing Falco in The Replacements. ""That's absolutely ridiculous,"" Reeves said with a huge smile. ""I got OK, but that is ridiculous. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yeah, I was out there, 'Blue 87!' [throwing] 50-yard outs no problem,"" he added laughing.The Baltimore Ravens, led by Brian Billick at that time, won Super Bowl XXXV less than six months after ""The Replacements"" premiered. While some sources suggest Billick might have expressed interest in Reeves, no official records or statements confirm that the Ravens extended a tryout invitation. Reeves' reputation for intense preparation in film roles and his portrayal of Shane Falco as a comeback-story quarterback make the rumor of him trying out for an NFL team plausible.Also Read: Will Taylor Swift attend the Chiefs-Texans game to cheer for Travis Kelce? Fans wonder if it's her final regular season appearance The Replacements was inspired very loosely by the 1987 NFL strike; in its story, one team-the won-out Washington Redskins-won three replacement games while all of its regular players were lost and then went on to win Super Bowl XXII after that. The story may center on replacement players, but the Falco–Martel quarterback controversy is reminiscent of the post-strike Washington controversy involving Doug Williams and Jay Schroeder.Squeezed in as the third position on the box office chart, the movie made $11,039,214 within its opening weekend in North American box office standings, following Space Cowboys and Hollow Man - which both made their way to this spot for the second consecutive week. By the end, it grossed about $44.7 million in domestic figures and about $5.3 million internationally, at more than $50 million worldwide.Although there is no official record, there are indications that Keanu Reeves was indeed offered the chance to play on the Ravens. However, Shane Falco was praised by Brian Billick, who at that time was the quarterback of the Baltimore Ravens.

Xavier Worthy's Grinch Celebration Backfires: NFL Penalty Controversy Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/xavier-worthys-grinch-celebration-backfires-nfl-penalty-controversy-explained/articleshow/116662294.cms,"(Image Via Getty)

Why Worthy’s Grinch moment sparked penalty



Xavier Worthy's best plays in 2-TD game vs. Ravens | Week 1

Xavier Worthy's Grinch-style celebration penalized under questionable circumstances



Kansas City Chiefs rookie Xavier Worthy made a memorable debut at Acrisure Stadium, quickly making his presence felt with a spectacular touchdown. However, his festive celebration soon stole the spotlight, sparking controversy. After catching a pass from Patrick Mahomes and sprinting into the end zone, Worthy and teammate Hollywood Brown staged a playful Grinch-inspired act. But the fun quickly turned into a penalty, leaving fans and officials puzzled. Here's why that celebration led to a flag and what it meant for the game.Kansas City Chiefs rookie wide receiver Xavier Worthy wasted no time making an impact at Acrisure Stadium, but his bold move had a holiday twist that left fans and officials scratching their heads. After the Chiefs defense quickly shut down the Pittsburgh Steelers’ opening drive, Patrick Mahomes and his offense took full advantage of the prime field position.Inside the red zone, Worthy lined up in the backfield before sprinting out to the left flat, where he was wide open. Mahomes delivered a quick pass, and Worthy turned on the afterburners, darting into the end zone for a swift touchdown. But what happened next? His celebration, of course.Worthy and fellow wide receiver Hollywood Brown pulled off a cheeky Grinch-inspired act, with Worthy pretending to throw presents into a bag held by Brown. They ran off, clearly having fun, but the referees weren’t having it. A flag flew for unsportsmanlike conduct, forcing kicker Harrison Butker to attempt a 48-yard extra point.Butker missed the PAT after being pushed back, but the real question remains: Why was Worthy penalized for the celebration in the first place?Why did a Christmas-themed celebration land Worthy in hot water? The Chiefs rookie found himself flagged after he and Brown “stole” all the presents from under the Steelers’ tree. The controversy erupted when, during the celebration, Worthy appeared to pull up his jersey or subtly reach for his hip, mimicking the motion of drawing a weapon. While the gesture wasn’t blatantly aggressive, the referees were quick to react.The NFL has a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to any celebrations that could be interpreted as involving weapons or violence. Even the slightest hint of such behavior is enough for a penalty, and that’s exactly what happened. At least Worthy didn’t get flagged for being the Grinch—though who knows what the No Fun League will do next?Still, Worthy needs to be smarter. Despite stepping into a bigger role this season due to Brown’s injury, his actions cost the Chiefs valuable points in a high-stakes game. Regardless of intent, any gesture that could be perceived as threatening has no place in the league. Players must be aware of how every move is interpreted, especially when the stakes are this high.Also Read : Kelly Stafford, Matthew Stafford's wife, and kids celebrate Christmas Eve with cozy movie night","Kansas City Chiefs rookie wide receiver Xavier Worthy made a memorable debut at Acrisure Stadium.

Pat Cummins reveals Australia's XI for Boxing Day Test

Australia coach Andrew McDonald confirms Sam Konstas to debut against India

The International Cricket Council (ICC) is likely to review an incident involving Virat Kohli and debutant Sam Konstas during the first morning of the Boxing Day Test . Test cricket legend Ricky Ponting believes Kohli was responsible for the altercation.Ponting stated that Kohli initiated the physical contact with Konstas between overs. The incident occurred in the first session of the fourth Test in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .The encounter resembled a scene from an Australian Rules football game. The two players bumped into each other and exchanged words.Usman Khawaja, Konstas's opening partner, intervened to de-escalate the situation. Umpire Michael Gough also stepped in to mediate.Neither player backed down during the exchange.“Virat walked one whole pitch over to his right and instigated that confrontation. No doubt in my mind whatsoever,” said Ponting in commentary.Ponting expressed his certainty on Channel Seven that the umpires and match referee would review the incident. He emphasised that fielders should maintain a distance from batters between overs.“I have no doubt that the umpires and the referee will have a good look at that. Fielders should be nowhere near the batsman at that stage. Every fieldsman on the ground knows where the batsmen will congregate and get together.”He pointed out that Konstas appeared unaware of Kohli's presence until the last moment.“It looked to me that Konstas looked up really late, wouldn’t even know anyone is in front of him. That man on-screen there (Kohli) might have a few questions to answer.”Match referee Andy Pycroft is expected to examine the incident. The ICC Code of Conduct prohibits any inappropriate physical contact. Players can breach this regulation through deliberate, reckless, or negligent actions.A Level Two offence could result in three or four demerit points. Four points would lead to a suspension for the New Year's Test in Sydney. A Level One offence would likely result in a fine.Kagiso Rabada's contact with Steve Smith during the 2018 South Africa-Australia Test series initially earned him three demerit points. This penalty was later overturned on appeal.The contact between Kohli and Konstas appeared more forceful than the Rabada-Smith incident.“Whatever happens on the field stays on the field,” was Konstas's only comment on the incident when speaking to Fox Cricket during a drinks break.Previously, Konstas had expressed admiration for Kohli. After his maiden Sheffield Shield century in October, he mentioned Kohli as one of three individuals he would have dreamt of receiving a congratulatory text from.Alyssa Healy, the Australian women's cricket captain, criticised Kohli's actions. She believed Kohli targeted the youngest member of the Australian team.“I think it's more disappointing than anything else that your experienced player, one of your best players in the country, has quite visibly made a beeline for the youngest player in the opposition.”She also noted that the incident did not appear to affect Konstas. “It doesn't really set the greatest of tone for your side but if that's the way the Indian team want to approach it then so be it, but it didn't rattle Kontas one bit.”Both Ricky Ponting and former Test umpire Simon Taufel believe neither player will face suspension though. “We don't want to see any physical contact during the game. It tends to get out-of-control.”Taufel acknowledged the heightened emotions of the game. He also noted that both players stood their ground. “A lot of adrenaline flowing. Sam Konstas holding his ground. Virat Kohli did the same thing. It's something out of nothing. We don't want to see it continue.”He suggested the incident would be reviewed later, possibly during a lunch break or at the end of the day's play. “It's something they'll have a look at during maybe a lunch break or even at the end of the day's play.”Taufel predicted that the incident would likely be overlooked. He suggested letting the players express themselves without further consequences. “I tend to think they'll let that one go. That's my view at this stage. Let the players say what they want to say. Get a few things off their chest. At times if it goes further, they'll probably let that one slide.”",The International Cricket Council (ICC) is likely to review an incident involving Virat Kohli and debutant Sam Konstas.

MELBOURNE: ""Look, hard to say. In terms of form, no. Not for me to answer."" The question had been rhetorical, whether India's captain Rohit Sharma would be under pressure going into the fourth Test because of his lack of runs, and Pat Cummins had done well to avoid the potential banana skin.India and Australia have stared at some identical threads throughout this series, like the top-order woes of both teams and the talk of impending transition. The constant pressure on the two captains, and their contrasting turn of fortunes, has been another. Both teams are positioned at the confluence of eras. Going into the fourth Test, Cummins and Rohit again find themselves staring at uncertainty.Strangely, Cummins isn't the most popular of Australian captains in spite of his phenomenal prowess with the ball, his pleasing demeanour and the attempts at addressing wider social issues as a statesman of the game. Perhaps Australia just doesn't take too kindly to bowler captains. As for Rohit Sharma, lately he can't seem to find a run either at the top or in the middle order, and the batting woes of his team have magnified his inadequacies. The public image of both captains has swung along with the results.A few weeks ago, following the defeat in Perth, Cummins was the face of a team reviled by its own fans. One win in Adelaide later, he seems to have earned a temporary reprieve, but a win at the MCG is what really matters. India, meanwhile, have already seen the hasty retirement of one great, Ravichandran Ashwin , midway through the series. They'll want to avoid any further unsavoury drama.Both have handled the pressure differently. On Christmas day, Cummins seemed in a happy place, with friends and family around, Travis Head declared fit, the promise of an exciting new talent in Sam Konstas and generally positive vibes in the team. Addressing the issue of impending changes on both sides, he sounded philosophical. ""Every team always has something they're grappling with or trying to improve on. For us it's about focusing on what we do well.""He spoke about embracing captaincy, and what it was about the leadership role that excited him.""My most enjoyable part is playing with teammates and working together to try and get a win or overcome a problem. Being captain, you get an opportunity to do that not just with the players but coaches and staff and other leaders within the group. I love all that, discussions around the style of play and helping shape the team around me. The other layer is seeing some new players make debut.""A day earlier, Rohit had talked about similar issues, but in a completely different way. ""It's a challenge to handle not just the bowling but the entire team. You try to come out here with the intent of trying to get the best out of everyone. As captain, my message is simple. Keep doing what you've been doing.""Two captains, two contrasting attitudes. Unlike Cummins, Rohit is grappling with issues of form. On Wednesday, rumours swirled that he would reclaim his opening slot and push KL Rahul to No. 3, but then Indian cricket has always been an exercise in smoke and mirrors.Cummins wouldn't mind either way. He has the edge in the head-to-head game, having dismissed Rohit six times in nine Tests and twice in this series. His animated celebration in Brisbane after getting a leaden-footed Rohit out got social-media outlets buzzing. Both have legacies to uphold as leaders.","India and Australia have stared at some identical threads throughout this series.

HEAD FIT TO PLAY

MELBOURNE: In keeping with the Yuletide spirit, both India and Australia go into the Boxing Day Test with renewed hope after a period of quiet reflection.For both, this game will mark a line in the sand, either for good or bad. The MCG will yield its gifts to only one, with the other left standing on the precipice of change. It seldom happens that two opponents share identical narratives over a long Test series, but as circumstances stand, this fourth Test is now the most important game of the year for both.India are attempting to become the first and only team since England in 1885 to win three consecutive Tests at the MCG. Victory will ensure they will at least retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , no matter what happens in the last game in Sydney. It will also keep their World Test Championship hopes alive and may earn some declining batting wizards a temporary breather.Likewise, defeat for Australia can trigger the unwholesome exit of some giants of the modern game. If they win, the Aussies take the lead and hope for their first series win against India in a decade. Seldom has a game had so much at stake.On match eve, Pat Cummins 's team chose to cast the dark clouds of doubt aside and indulge in some Christmas cheer, bringing their families to the ground for a bit of festive socializing. It was the sort of occasion which can boost morale, relax shoulders and straighten the furrowed eyebrows of those under the microscope.India, on the other hand, spent Christmas being reclusive, having long decided to skip practice on Wednesday. The team has a lot to think about. Does their captain return to his original spot in the batting order as opener? Has Shubman Gill's long rope at No. 3 run out?Which fast bowler can take wickets after Bumrah's spell is over? Will Prasidh Krishna get a game? Can Rishabh Pant's adrenaline bursts last longer than a few balls?Anticipation and intrigue surrounds India but these aren't the only issues they need to sort out. The impending heat wave may see the pitch quicken up, so decisions made at the toss will be crucial. Do they back their misfiring and muddled top order or put it all on Bumrah's capable hands again? And will bringing in a second spinner in Washington Sundar actually help? Pacers have, after all, taken 155 of the 191 wickets that have fallen to bowlers over the last six Tests here.When it comes to India, the permutations may seem overwhelming. The Aussies look more sorted, having already announced their XI, but face similar questions. They have already replaced a struggling makeshift opener with a regular one. The late inclusion of Sam Konstas is a gamble they are hoping will pay off.""There's a level of naivety (at that age), you just want to go out and play like you do when you're a kid in your backyard,"" Cummins said of Konstas. ""You just want to take the game on, have fun and not overthink.""Josh Hazlewood's injury means Scott Boland, who wrecked England in his debut Test here in 2021 with 6/7 in the second innings, returns for another Boxing Day Test. It is the mental makeup of their top order batters, and the psychological edge gained by Bumrah, that is the real concern for Australia.Luckily, Travis Head is fit and will play, so that's half the battle taken care of. Head hit the nets with gusto on a sunny Christmas morning after rumours swirled that he may have passed a fitness Test following a minor quad strain. Cummins cleared the air a few minutes later. ""He ticked off some final things today and yesterday, but no stress, no worries about injury for Trav. He'll go into the game fully fit. I don't think you'll see too much management of his injury throughout the game, maybe around the fielding if he's a bit uncomfortable,"" Cummins said.""After three matches, if I look at the series being one-all, I'd say it's a fair reflection of how both teams have played,"" Rohit Sharma had said a day earlier, summing up the series. ""There's been some solid cricket played by both teams. When you tour abroad, you know you have to put in that extra effort, have that extra bit of attitude within the team. We showed that in Perth. These two Test matches are going to be so important for both teams. For us, we want to break it down to just Melbourne now and see what we can achieve.""For both India and Australia, the arena beckons. This has been a bizarre, winding series with very few days of actual cricket played since the Perth Test. The MCG is where some decipherable pattern may finally emerge.","India are attempting to become the first and only team since England in 1885 to win three consecutive Tests at the MCG. Victory will ensure they will at least retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. If they win, the Aussies take the lead and hope for their first series win against India in a decade.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116668214,imgsize-70624,width-400,resizemode-4/116668214.jpg"

India XI for the fourth Test:

Sam Konstas , 19, made a remarkable Test debut at the Melbourne Cricket Ground , becoming only the second player to hit two sixes off Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah in a single Test innings. This came after Australia won the toss and elected to bat in the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .Konstas displayed an aggressive and fearless approach from the moment he stepped onto the field. He immediately targeted Bumrah, showcasing his intent to make an impact.After surviving a maiden over, Konstas quickly seized the initiative. He executed a reverse ramp shot, sending Bumrah's delivery over the wicketkeeper for a boundary.Konstas's aggressive approach continued. He followed up with a stunning reverse scoop for six, sailing over the slip fielders. This audacious shot was noteworthy as it marked the first six conceded by Bumrah in Test cricket after 4483 balls or since 2021.Konstas continued his assault on Bumrah, adding another six in the 11th over. This made him only the second player, after England's Jos Buttler, to hit two sixes off Bumrah in a single Test innings.Konstas's batting showcased not just power but also precise timing and accuracy. His mature and fearless approach belied his young age, suggesting he is well-suited to the demands of Test cricket.Konstas received his Test debut cap from former Australian captain Mark Taylor. This marked a significant milestone in his career. At 19 years and 85 days old, he became the fourth youngest Australian to debut in Test cricket.Konstas joins a select group of young Australian Test debutants.

MELBOURNE: Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill , India's next rung of elite batters, have found support from their captain after a string of poor scores. While Jaiswal has fallen away after a fine century in Perth and got out to soft dismissals off Mitchell Starc and Scott Boland, there have been questions raised over Gill's technique following his inability to convert starts. Rohit Sharma , however, said it would be unwise to tinker with their mindset and technique at this stage of their careers.""Gill, Jaiswal, they're both in the same boat. You don't want to be telling Jaiswal too many things about his batting. He has come here for the first time and already shown what he's capable of. You don't want to tamper too much with his mindset. Let him be as free as possible and not overburdened with too many thoughts regarding his batting. He understands his batting more than any of us. It's about trying to figure out certain areas of his game."" Rohit said, adding, ""Every venue here has different challenges. It's about adapting. The bowlers are the same. They've got four seamers and one offspinner. It's about understanding what they usually do and what their plans are against certain batters.""Gill, meanwhile, has struggled overseas. Since the 91 against Australia in Brisbane in 2021, he has not crossed 40 in 16 innings in Tests played in New Zealand, England, Australia, West Indies and South Africa.""Both innings in Adelaide, I thought Gill looked pretty good. He just didn't convert that start into a big score. I'm not going to look too much into Brisbane, he got out early,"" Rohit said. ""These tours can be challenging. It's not that easy to put on those big runs every time you step out. Gill has quality. It's just about backing that quality. Like Jaiswal, we don't want to complicate too many things with him.""Rohit, who has hit a horror patch of form himself, seems fit to play after injuring his knee during training earlier. On Tuesday, he pleased crowds at the open nets but seemed displeased when asked if he would continue to bat in the middle order. ""Let's not worry about that.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

Why R Ashwin retirement was a last minute surprise for Ravindra Jadeja

NEW DELHI: After former India captain Kapil Dev voiced his dissatisfaction over Ravichandran Ashwin not being given a grand farewell, the recently-retired player reckons otherwise, saying he doesn't believe in grand farewell ceremonies.Ashwin stunned the cricketing world midway through the Border-Gavaskar Trophy by announcing his retirement from international cricket at the end of third Test in Brisbane last week.""I wish I had been there, I wouldn't have let him go like that. I would have sent him with a lot of respect and happiness,"" Kapil told ANI.However, Ashwin expressed that grand farewells are inappropriate, stating that such send-offs cater more to a culture of super celebrity worship.""As far as I am concerned, grand farewells are wrong. I don't think you should give grand farewell ceremonies to anyone. Especially, I firmly believe that you shouldn't give me a grand farewell. I don't want anyone shedding a drop of tear for me. I think grand send-offs are part of a super celebrity culture,"" Ashwin told television presenter Gobinath on a YouTube show.Why should we run behind someone? I understand we run behind someone for the love we have for them. But I feel that people should get inspired by one's achievements, the legacy that one leaves behind, the way one left the game, and the way one has spoken about the game. But farewells are wrong, I think. If there is a match that has been organised just to celebrate me, I think it's a disservice to the game,"" Ashwin added.""I don't have any regrets about it. Zero regrets. If I am not happy with 537 wickets, then for what will I be happy? Why should I be sad about something that's not there? There is great joy in acceptance. You chase something that you don't have. But don't regret something that you don't have. Don't crib about it.""Ashwin insisted that the call to retire was entirely his own decision and that he did not shed a single tear on his final day as international cricketer.Ashwin clarified that the decision to retire from the game was entirely his own, emphasising that no one else was responsible for it.""I quit this part of my life. It was a full stop to that part of my life. I can talk cricket, I do YouTube, I love coaching. I can keep myself happy around cricket.

Rohit Sharma: 'Virat Kohli is a modern day great. He will figure it out'

Pat Cummins reveals Australia's XI for Boxing Day Test

NEW DELHI: With the Boxing Day Test set to begin at iconic MCG on Thursday, all eyes are on Virat Kohli , who seeks to overcome his recent batting struggles in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy .In his recent five innings, Kohli's performance has been inconsistent, with scores fluctuating between 5, 100 not out, 7, 11, and 3. His overall series statistics show a modest accumulation of 126 runs, resulting in an average of 31.50.The batting maestro, renowned for his resilience and class, faces the challenge of delivering on a stage where he has previously shone. Kohli’s form has been under scrutiny, but the MCG has often been a ground where greats have rediscovered their spark.Kohli's record at the Melbourne Cricket Ground spans across three Test matches, during which he has accumulated 316 runs in six innings. At the MCG, his batting statistics showcase remarkable consistency, with an outstanding average of 52.66.His finest performance at this historic venue was an exceptional knock of 169, which stands as his highest score and remains a significant milestone in his career at this ground. Beyond his hundred, Kohli's record includes two fifties at this ground.Former India head coach Ravi Shastri recently shared his thoughts about cricketers like Virat Kohli. He emphasised that such players never truly experience a dip in form, suggesting that they simply need to display patience and determination at the crease.""I think the same with Virat. If Virat gets over that first 30, 40 minutes, with serious application and discipline, I don't think he's (out of form), none of these guys are out of form,"" Shastri said in the ICC Review.Australian batting great Matthew Hayden also advised Kohli to learn from Sachin Tendulkar 's composed innings at 2004 Sydney Test and control his instinct to play away from his body, particularly outside the off-stump. This approach, Hayden suggests, could help Kohli return to form in the final two matches of the ongoing series.""I know he (Kohli) has a magnificent cover drive, but so did Sachin Tendulkar, and he put it away for a day. I sat in the gully licking my lips, thinking, you know what, this is magnificent, stubborn batting,"" Hayden told Star Sports.Against a fierce bowling attack and under the weight of expectations, Kohli’s ability to adapt and anchor the innings will be critical. Fans hope the festive Test reignites the run-machine’s fire and silences his critics.","Virat Kohli's form has been inconsistent in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

The Border-Gavaskar Trophy is at a crucial point, tied at 1-1, as India prepares for the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. Numerous selection challenges have emerged following the drawn third Test at the Gabba.Ravichandran Ashwin's unexpected retirement after the Gabba Test has created a significant gap in the Indian squad. His tactical acumen and exceptional spin bowling will be missed.Tanush Kotian, a young off-spinning all-rounder, has been chosen to replace Ashwin. This marks a fresh start for India's spin bowling attack.Nitish Kumar Reddy 's position in the playing XI is a major talking point. Some suggest replacing Reddy with Washington Sundar for an extra spin option. However, Sunil Gavaskar disagrees.“They can’t drop Nitish Kumar Reddy. He is the fourth seamer. I can’t see India going in with just two pacers and Nitish. For me, it is pretty much this XI that plays in Melbourne,” Gavaskar told Star Sports.Reddy's bowling performance in the series has been underwhelming, although he's a dependable lower-order batsman. Gavaskar believes Reddy's potential for crucial breakthroughs and batting contributions are essential for the team's balance.Changes at the top of the batting order are also being considered. Rohit Sharma might return to his preferred opening position.This would necessitate adjustments to the middle order. K.L. Rahul could bat at number three, replacing Shubman Gill.Gill, who hasn't performed well, might move down to number four or be replaced by Dhurv Jurel.India's pace bowling attack is another area of discussion. Akash Deep, whose batting heroics helped India avoid the follow-on at the Gabba, is expected to keep his place.“Unlikely that Harshit will replace Akash Deep. Why would you drop a man who has saved your team from follow-on?” Gavaskar stated.","The Border-Gavaskar Trophy is at a crucial point, tied at 1-1, as India prepares for the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne.

The team has recently faced challenges with injuries and suspensions, impacting their performance in the Premier League Despite these setbacks, Postecoglou remains committed to his attacking style of play.

However, this was followed by a heavy 6-3 defeat against Liverpool in the league.Postecoglou confirmed his intention to strengthen the squad in January, ahead of the Boxing Day fixture against Nottingham Forest.""Like I said a while ago, we've been planning,"" he told a pre-match press conference.""A lot of it was going to be around where we're at around this time. Fair to say we're still a little bit short in a couple of areas and we need to reinforce.""Tottenham's continued involvement in multiple competitions necessitates squad depth. Postecoglou pointed out the demands of the Carabao Cup, European competition, and the FA Cup.""I think the fact that, obviously, we're still in the Carabao (League) Cup semi-final, still got Europe, FA Cup, we're in all the competitions, it's not like our schedule's going to ease up at any stage.""""So, I think it makes sense.

Chelsea hold second position in the Premier League , but their manager Enzo Maresca remains grounded, emphasising on Tuesday his focus on team development rather than title discussions.With 35 points, Chelsea trail Liverpool by four points and are scheduled for a West London derby against Fulham on Thursday.The weekend's goalless encounter with Everton prevented Chelsea from claiming the top spot, whilst ending their impressive streak of eight consecutive victories across all competitions and five successive Premier League wins.""We are ahead of our expectation in terms of the way we are playing and points. For us, the main focus is to see how we can improve the players and how we can improve the team,"" Maresca told reporters.""It's the reality for me, not about the pressure (of going for the title). I would like that kind of pressure. I say we are not there because that is the reality for me.

The four-time consecutive Premier League winners have lost nine of their last 12 games leading into the Boxing Day match against Everton.""They (City) have enjoyed so much success under Pep (Guardiola) over the years that everybody seems to be under this impression that it's when, not if, it turns back,"" said Dyche.Dyche acknowledges City's dominance under Pep Guardiola and the expectation of their eventual return to form.

The Everton manager views City's current struggles as a testament to the Premier League's competitiveness.""You'd think at some point it happens, even to the best, and he is arguably one of the best ever, but for him to have a testing period actually shows how tough the game is even for the top sides.""Dyche points out that even the best teams are susceptible to difficulties if they don't maintain attention to detail.

Manchester City 's poor performance, with just one victory in eight Premier League matches, is a collective team issue rather than an individual's fault, according to manager Pep Guardiola 's statement on Tuesday. He emphasised that striker Erling Haaland should not be singled out for criticism.The champions' current position at seventh place, trailing Liverpool by 12 points, has coincided with Haaland's reduced scoring rate. After netting 10 goals in the initial five matches, the Norwegian has only scored twice during this difficult period.""It's about us, it's not just about one player,"" Guardiola told a press conference ahead of Thursday's game with Everton .""So when in the past we scored goals and Erling was so prolific in helping us, it's because of the team. And when you have problems at the back, in the middle, it's for everyone.""If it was just one player, the reason why, it would be easy. It's not about that.

He emphasised the importance of upcoming matches as opportunities for improvement.Everton, despite being 15th in the table and 11 points behind City, has demonstrated strong defensive capabilities with five clean sheets in their previous six matches.Guardiola praised Sean Dyche 's tactical approach, particularly highlighting Everton's defensive organisation and effectiveness in transitions.With the Boxing Day fixture approaching, City's players will have limited family time during Christmas.

Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola is emphasizing the need for his team to maintain their strong performance at both ends of the field. He believes this is key to continuing their positive start to the Premier League season.The Cherries recently secured a 3-0 victory against Manchester United at Old Trafford , extending their unbeaten streak in the Premier League to five games. This impressive run has placed them fifth in the league standings.However, the upcoming busy Christmas and New Year period will challenge their squad depth.

Djokovic needs one more Grand Slam trophy for an unprecedented 25th crown, surpassing Margaret Court's 24, and the legend from Serbia is optimistic about achieving it in 2025, beginning his quest with the Australian Open in January.He will begin the season with the Brisbane International starting this week, which will also feature world number one Aryna Sabalenka leading the women' field.This season marks a significant shift as it's the first time in 37-year-old Djokovic's career where none of his traditional 'Big Four' rivals will compete, following the departures of Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray this year. Roger Federer announced his retirement in 2022.Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner decided to skip preparatory tournaments before the year's first major championship, the Australian Open, which starts on January 12.Based on the standards Djokovic sets, 2024 proved difficult, with no Grand Slam victories and only securing the Olympic gold in Paris, before concluding his season in October.The Brisbane tournament features strong competitors including an in-form Grigor Dimitrov, Holger Rune and Frances Tiafoe. Australian Nick Kyrgios joins the lineup after a lengthy absence, having played just one ATP Tour singles match in two years due to injuries.Djokovic will also be seen in men's doubles, partnering Kyrgios.On the women's side of the competition, there are American stars Jessica Pegula and Emma Navarro, ranked seventh and eighth respectively. The field also features former world number two Ons Jabeur and the experienced Victoria Azarenka.World No. 1 Sabalenka, who defeated China's rising star Zheng Qinwen in this year's Melbourne final, experienced an outstanding 2024, culminating in her recognition as WTA Player of the Year this month.The accomplished tennis player, aged 26, demonstrated remarkable success by reaching seven finals and securing four championships, including a successful defence of her Australian Open title, clinching her maiden US Open victory, and winning WTA 1000 tournaments in Cincinnati and Wuhan.She managed to regain the top world ranking from Swiatek, the five-time Grand Slam winner, whose standing faced scrutiny in November when reports emerged about her positive test for prohibited cardiac medication in August.The International Tennis Integrity Agency determined that the breach was unintentional, resulting in a minimal one-month penalty for the Polish athlete.The situation mirrors that of Australian Open champion Sinner, who awaits the World Anti-Doping Agency's verdict regarding his earlier clearance after two positive tests for clostebol traces in March.","Novak Djokovic needs one more Grand Slam trophy for an unprecedented 25th crown, surpassing Margaret Court's 24.

Excerpts:

Why did you and Ebden decide not to pursue the partnership in 2025?

What was your thinking behind partnering Nicolás Barrientos?

You partnered Sriram Balaji for the Olympics, was he an option?

You’ve announced you’re playing with Barrientos for just two tournaments, Adelaide and then the Australian Open…

Is 2025 your farewell season?

What did your success in that 12-month stretch from mid-2023 to the summer of 2024 tell you about yourself?

How does the future of Indian tennis look at this stage?

IN NUMBERS

At the start of the year Rohan Bopanna gave himself the best pre-44th birthday gift when he claimed the World No.1 ranking and clinched his first men’s doubles Grand Slam title in a spectacular 2024 Australian Open fortnight, where he became the poster boy for longevity.The Indian rode that wave with Matthew Ebden into the summer after which their season lost some shine, bringing to an end a strong partnership. Bopanna, ranked 15, starts the 2025 season down under in starkly different circumstances – pairing with the 37-year-old Colombian Nicolás Barrientos – but is no less determined to keep going.To me and my coach Scott (Davidoff) it came as a surprise, I don't think either of us expected it. I mean he had some reasons, he wanted to change.Initially, during the US Open, he said he was going to play with Austin Krajicek, but I think that fell apart and then he came back saying he wants to play with me. Then during the Paris Masters the Belgians — Joran Vliegen and Sanders Gille — split, when he decided he wanted to play with Vliegen. I don't know what the real reason behind that was.He was the one available, Ebden said he wanted to play with Joran Vliegen literally five days before Turin (in November). It was so late in the season, everybody already had a partner. One of the reasons to pair with Barrientos (ranked 49) was because there's a good chance for us to be seeded, especially because we’re going into a Grand Slam.It was going to be a random pairing anyway no matter who I played with, so I thought I might as well play with somebody who I can be seeded with at least. Especially since I'm defending the title. Also, he’s very strong off the baseline, he's very quick and makes a lot of balls and that game style could work for me. I've played against him but not really hung out with him so much. Even when I played with Ebden it was similar right.He was also set with another partner, same with Yuki Bhambri.One of the reasons we said only two tournaments is because it depends where we both are ranked after the Australian Open. If I don’t defend points, my ranking drops, so then no way Barrientos and me are getting into Masters or 500 Series draws. I haven't fixed with anybody else after (Australia) because it all depends on where I am ranked and where Barrientos is ranked.Everybody has been asking me the same thing for the last two years. It is tough (to think about retirement) when for the last two years, I've qualified for the season-ending championships. When you're making the ATP Finals it means you have had a good enough season so there is no reason really to stop.As long as I'm feeling fit and physically ready to play the Masters and the Grand Slams, it (retiring) is not even a consideration.The biggest thing was how well I was feeling physically and that translated into how well I ended up playing. As a team Ebden and I were doing incredibly well, we complimented each other beautifully. What changed personally for me was that belief of being able to perform at a high level and not looking at it in terms of whether I was (doing it) at age 40, at the fag end of my career or not.First and foremost for the future of Indian tennis, we need the federation to be sorted out, all tournaments juniors or seniors are determined through a solid federation. We need to create a strong domestic circuit. More than everybody looking to play Futures, Challengers, yes we need that, but I think a strong domestic circuit (is what we need the most). Also, once a player crosses 18 they are kind of lost because there’s no platform for them to transition to the next level so players in that age-group are giving up the sport because it is too expensive to travel. In the domestic circuit, there is hardly any prize money so nobody really wants to travel. The domestic circuit needs to grow, something similar to golf maybe.Bopanna claimed the World No.1 ranking after winning his first major doubles title at the 2024 Australian Open becoming the oldest first-time No. 1 at the age of 43.Bopanna and Ebden won the 2024 Miami Masters. At the age of 44, Bopanna overtook his own record to become the oldest ATP Masters 1000 finalist and champion.",Rohan Bopanna will play with Nicolás Barrientos for just two tournaments in 2025. The World No.15 is determined to keep going after winning the Australian Open. Bopana says the future of Indian tennis is in the juniors.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116646135,imgsize-115188,width-400,resizemode-4/116646135.jpg"

Rohit Sharma: 'Virat Kohli is a modern day great. He will figure it out'

While settled is not a space athletes would choose for themselves given that the race is all about moving forward, it’s equitable usage in the world of doubles and partnerships. Ask Yuki Bhambri .The 32-year-old, mid-career in the two-man team game, played alongside seven partners before settling with the 6-ft-8 Albano Olivetti with whom he contested 16 tournaments in 2024, making four finals and winning two titles, and finishing the year with a top-50 ranking for the first time in his career.“Four finals is good effort,” Bhambri said. “I don't think this was a fantastic season, but from where I was in January to where it ended, it’s good. It's nice to start a season with an existing partnership, that gives us a little bit of an edge.”Bhambri and Olivetti have Brisbane and Adelaide in their plans before the Australian Open in January.The Indo-French combine did well in the ATP 250s but are yet to break through in the higher category events.“We're still finding our feet in bigger events, in some matches we had chances, but some others we were just blown away,” Bhambri said. “This season was more of a learning experience we can do better in the next season thanks to all that we have learnt.”Bhambri, who finished the season with an individual doubles ranking of No. 48, did something he hasn’t done in the last five years, even when his body was broken and his spirits were low. In November he lined up a group of friends for an end-of-season holiday to Norway, ticking off the Northern Lights, which has long been on his bucket list.“We were there for a week, three cities -- Trondheim, Lofoten and Oslo. It was a nice break, a lot of snow, wind and layering (clothing),” Bhambri said, adding, “This was a mixed group, six of us. The good thing that came out of being injured (end of 2018 to early 2022) is that I got to spend a lot of time at home, I became social. I had the opportunity to meet some cool people outside of tennis.”“This holiday happened at a good time, I had a good season, that’s reason to celebrate. Some of the others in the group were also celebrating anniversaries and milestone birthdays so it was just nice,” Bhambri said.The 32-year-old, who was ranked No.1 in the juniors, winning boys singles title in the 2009 Australian Open, said his biggest takeaway from the season was patience.“I remember in January and February, I was really rattled. I was hoping to kick on to the next level… and not having those wins initially was tough,” he said. “Doubles is very fast-paced and unpredictable. You could be going home happy or sad depending on one point literally. I hadn't really experienced that roller-coaster of emotions before.”“I continued to do the work and play the matches with a positive frame of mind, but I do remember going into some events earlier on where you sort of doubted yourself a little bit. I wondered if I belonged in this level or not,” he said.Bhambri shifted to doubles after sitting out three seasons, save for a couple of tournaments, struggling with tendonitis on his right knee.“In singles you can see who the better player is at times,” he said. “In doubles you could bring all the right things to the court and still end up on the losing side.”Bhambri, who climbed to a career best No. 83 in singles in April 2018, learned the importance of being ‘level-headed’ while navigating the storm of competition. It doesn’t always add up in match play, but it is important to persevere.","Yuki Bhambri and Albano Olivetti have settled into doubles partnership.

Rohit Sharma: 'Virat Kohli is a modern day great. He will figure it out'

There’s a quasi-Indian story brewing in world tennis that has set tongues wagging. A Guntur-chili eating, Tollywood-watching teenager is burning the rectangle. Only the icon against his name is the United States flag, the country he was born and raised in.Nishesh Basavareddy , born in Newport Beach, California and grew up in Carmel, Indiana, started the 2024 season ranked No. 457; he’s at a career-high No. 138 in the ATP ranking presently.The 19-year-old enjoyed a rousing run on the Challenger Tour where he made six finals, winning two titles, including one in his last outing in Mexico. The American’s show, racking up a 41-13 record, not only earned him a place in the ATP Next Gen Finals in Jeddah, starting December 18, but also saw him clinch the USTA Australian Open wildcard that secured his spot in the Melbourne Park main draw.Basavareddy studied Data Science at Stanford University for two years before announcing in early December that he was turning professional.The American teenager, bespectacled, with a studious appearance, explained the Collegiate route was what the doctor ordered for him.“I was 17 when I graduated,” he said. “I had a lot of areas where I needed to mature, it was not just physically, as a person also. I had a lot of injuries when I was a junior so I thought it would be good to get a couple more years of matches in college while also having time to develop physically and tennis wise. Turning pro straight away after high school was never really an option for me.”Basavareddy is mentored by two-time Olympic silver medallist and multiple-time major winner Rajeev Ram , who also resides in Carmel, Indiana.“When I moved to Indiana, I started working with the same coach that he (Ram) used to work with and still does,” he said. “We started meeting when he was home from the Tour.
