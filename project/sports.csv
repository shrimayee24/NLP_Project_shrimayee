She set World Records at junior and senior levels, establishing herself as a rising star in para shooting.Alongside her sporting pursuits, Avani is committed to her academic goals and was enrolled in a five-year law degree program at the University of Rajasthan, highlighting her multifaceted talents and determination to excel in all aspects of life.The pinnacle of Avani's sporting career came in 2021 when she made history at the Paralympic Games, becoming the first Indian female Paralympian to win two medals-a gold and a bronze-in a single event.Her triumphs resonated across the nation, and her remarkable achievements have been recognized with prestigious awards such as the Padma Shri and Khel Ratna.

Kohli has often credited Dhoni for shaping his career and helping him develop as a leader. Their bond has been an example of how different generations of cricketers can work together for the greater good of the team.Even after Dhoni's retirement from international cricket, their friendship continues to be strong, with Kohli often speaking highly of Dhoni and the lessons he learned from him.Their friendship is a testament to the strong bond that can exist between teammates, transcending the boundaries of cricket and becoming a relationship of mutual respect, mentorship, and enduring camaraderie.","Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are two of the most iconic figures in Indian cricket.

This event will take place outdoors at the Champs-Elysees and Place de la Concorde in central Paris. Delegations from all countries will march down a section of the Champs-Elysees, one of Paris's most iconic avenues.Sumit Antil is the defending gold medallist in javelin, while Bhagyashree Jadhav competes in shot put.This follows the example of the Paris Olympics opening ceremony, which was also held outside a traditional stadium on July 26, along the Seine River.India has sent a record 84-member team to the Paris Paralympics, aiming to win 25 medals, including at least ten golds. At the 2021 Tokyo Paralympics, India's 54-member team won 19 medals, including five golds.","The full day-by-day schedule for Indian athletes at the Paris 2024 Paralympics is as follows.

With a massive target of 483 runs to chase, Sri Lanka found themselves in a precarious position, ending the day at 53-2.

Dimuth Karunaratne (23) and Prabath Jayasuriya (3) were left to navigate the challenging conditions as play was halted due to poor light.The visitors face an uphill battle to rescue the series, with the highest successful run chase in international Test cricket history being 418, achieved by the West Indies against Australia in Antigua in May 2003.England's second innings saw them accumulate a total of 251, with Root's century being the standout performance. The hosts built on their 231-run lead from the first innings, playing under lights on a gloomy day in north London.Wickets fell steadily for England, with Ben Duckett (24), captain Ollie Pope (17), and Harry Brook (37) departing before the lunch interval. Duckett's dismissal was particularly noteworthy, as he fell victim to a fine two-man catch involving Nishan Madushka and Angelo Mathews After the break, wickets continued to tumble, but Root remained resolute in his pursuit of the record. Jamie Smith (26), Chris Woakes (5), Gus Atkinson (14), and Matthew Potts (2) all contributed to England's total, but it was Root's century that stole the show.As Root reached the coveted three-figure mark, he celebrated with unbridled joy, removing his helmet and saluting the crowd as his teammates applauded from the pavilion balcony.With Sri Lanka facing a monumental task to save the series, the fourth day promises to be a thrilling contest as England aims to secure victory and Sri Lanka fights to defy the odds and level the series.",Joe Root scores 103 in England's second innings to surpass Alastair Cook's record of 33 Test hundreds.

Margao: CSD Defensa y Justicia fought their way to the semifinals of the Bhausaheb Bandodkar Memorial Trophy , despite finishing their ill-tempered clash against Chennaiyin FC with just nine players at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Saturday.The youngsters from Argentina scored twice in the first half through Bohiler Mirko and Valdez Franco to stun Chennaiyin, and then defended resolutely to book a place in the knockout stage.They had to do it with nine players after Ivancic Lorenzo (73rd minute) and Machado Imanol (87th minute) were both sent off for a second bookable offence.In fact, the crucial concluding group clash saw players and coaches lose their cool with referee Ritesh Parsekar issuing 14 yellow cards. Eight of them were for Defensa y Justicia, whose two players received red, while Chennaiyin saw six of their players being booked.Even as Defensa y Justicia were celebrating their victory at the end of the final whistle, there was commotion in the end with players said to have got into a fist fight.

Flashback: When Sri Lanka defied expectations to dominate a drawn one-off game against England,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/flashback-when-sri-lanka-defied-expectations-to-dominate-a-drawn-one-off-game-against-england/articleshow/112961042.cms,"NEW DELHI: When Sri Lanka made their debut at the ""Home of Cricket"" in 1984, things were significantly different from how they are now playing the second Test against England at Lord's .Still a young Test team, the tourists surprised everyone by dominating a drawn one-off match, declaring 491-7 in their opening innings, powered by an outstanding 190 from Sidath Wettimuny .Recalling the scene forty years later, the then 28-year-old opener said it was a historic event for both his country and himself.""England is the home of cricket,"" Wettimuny told AFP in an interview at Lord's. ""We were very keen to show up and do something decent so that the world took notice of us.""In an apparently uncomfortable occurrence, Tamil demonstrators stormed the playing area before a ball was bowled, delaying the start of the Test.Wettimuny, however, insisted: ""That helped me tremendously. Not knowing what it was at first, I gradually moved towards the slip cordon because I was scared to be alone in the middle.""They (the demonstrators) were shouting and the (England) players asked me what this was all about and in that two or three minutes of conversation with them, I think it was like the fizz in a soda bottle going out.""I just forgot about cricket, forgot about batting and I was relaxed for a few minutes and then when I betted I just felt nice and relaxed.""With a string of perfect square-drives, Wettimuny punished an England attack led by Ian Botham several times.None more so than Wettimuny and his brothers, Sri Lankan cricketers have received their customary English education for a considerable amount of time.""I'll tell you, my father has to be given all the credit,"" said Wettimuny. ""He was a huge cricket enthusiast -- in fact he built the first indoor net in Sri Lanka.""And he was a fan of CB Fry (the 19th/20th century England batsman). He made us read CB Fry's 'On the Art of Batting'. My goodness, he used to grill us on that.""And he wanted us to play correct cricket.""Despite the present England team's aggressive Bazball strategy, the 1984 Sri Lankan team featured a captain named Duleep Mendis who was a really aggressive batsman.Mendis, who made 111, was diminutive but strong, hitting Botham bouncers for lofty sixes multiple times. When he fell for 94 in the second innings, the Sri Lankan captain was only a few runs short of reaching another hundred.""He was a phenomenal player when he got going,"" said Wettimuny of Mendis.""The instruction I got from him at the start of play was 'you bat through, you just hold your end'. It was very nice just to sit back and watch Duleep take the attack apart.""Wettimuny was so obedient to his captain's commands that he batted for almost 11 hours before cramps caused him to be out 10 runs short of a double century.""People say, weren't you unhappy about what you didn't get? I just say I was happy with what I got,"" explained Wettimuny.Many from an England team that had been 'blackwashed' 5-0 in a Test series earlier in 1984 by a West Indies team that included fast bowlers like Malcolm Marshall Michael Holding , and Joel Garner were not looking forward to a one-off match against Sri Lanka.However, England's fast Jonathan Agnew saw an opening.""I was very excited because it was just my second Test,"" Agnew told AFP.""But I was aware my team-mates were absolutely beaten up, they had had a very torrid time, there'd been a lot of injuries, nasty injuries, and they'd just been bombed, they were just out of it really.""Agnew, now the BBC's long-serving cricket correspondent, added: ""Sidath played really, really well, and he's become a good friend since. He batted immaculately and Duleep Mendis murdered 'Beefy' (Botham).""Another noteworthy aspect of the match was Arjuna Ranatunga , who at the age of 20 made an astounding 84.Ranatunga would go on to guide Sri Lanka to World Cup victory in 1996.""They've hardened up a lot,"" said Agnew. ""They played a bit like gentlemen then. When they first appeared, they sounded a bit old-fashioned, and played a bit old-fashioned.""But Ranatunga really sharpened them up and made them a fighting force.""","Sri Lanka made their debut at the ""Home of Cricket"" in 1984. The tourists surprised everyone by dominating a drawn one-off match. Sidath Wettimuny made 190 in Sri Lanka's opening innings. Tamil demonstrators stormed the playing area before a ball was bowled.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112961039,imgsize-115394,width-400,resizemode-4/112961039.jpg"

He sent the ball soaring over the boundary ropes on six occasions within a single over, leaving spectators in awe.Bharadwaj, known primarily for his left-arm spin, even resorted to bowling a delivery with his right hand in an attempt to stem the flow of runs. However, his efforts proved futile as the South Delhi Superstarz batsman continued his onslaught.He soon reached his century in just 40 balls, but Priyansh's assault on Manan under the afternoon sky stole the show. Priyansh started by charging down the pitch, launching Manan over long-off for a towering six, and then dropped to one knee to clear the long-on fence for another maximum.The barrage seemed endless as the left-handed batter smashed two more sixes over long-on, followed by another pair over long-off, collecting an incredible 36 runs from Manan’s 12th over. Priyansh eventually notched up his second century of the tournament in the 15th over.Priyansh became part of an elite group that includes Ross Whiteley (2017), Hazratullah Zazai (2018), and Leo Carter (2020), all of whom have hit six sixes in a domestic T20 match.

Take it in, Joe. We are watching a genius.""""I do not think there is a batsman that I can remember watching play (who shares) the sense of inevitability about scoring runs that Joe Root gives off. I called it when he was on about 6 today, that he was going to get 100. I know he is in great form, but it is just a pleasure to watch a master, a craftsman at work,"" said Cook.Cook reminisced about Root's early days, recalling their first encounter in a List A match in 2009 when Root made his debut with Yorkshire.Cook admitted he did not see Root as a 'great player' back then. ""He could not get the ball off the square,"" Cook recalled. ""Everyone said, 'he's a good player', but I did not see that,"" he added. Root scored 63 off 95 balls on his debut in List A format.Three years later, Cook was England's captain when Root made his international debut in the final Test of the 2012 series against India in Nagpur.Root scored 73 and 20* in a match that ended in a draw. Cook noted the mental readiness Root displayed for Test cricket from his first time at the crease.""The only check was when he walked out to bat for the first time, how he would handle it. The game was in the balance and he walked out to bat with his England cap on, looking 13, massive smile on his face. I watched his first few balls, and I was like, 'This bloke is here to stay.' I honestly said, 'He's scoring 10,000 runs.' I don't know who I said it to, but I know that I said it,"" he concluded.Root, now 32, has played 145 Test matches, accumulating 12,377 runs at an average of 50.93, with 34 centuries and 64 fifties.

I got to watch Rohit Shama practice and play cricket. He is so elegant,"" Rhodes told ANI.While Rhodes admires the elegance Rohit brings to the field, he doesn't believe Rohit's presence is essential for LSG's pursuit of success.""I mean, there's the balance of teams, who's in the side. I love watching Rohit Sharma bat, but I'm not saying he must come in and replace, and then suddenly we change our setup. So whatever, as I said, whatever happens, who is ever there? I'll be doing my best to support,"" he added.In addition to the speculation surrounding Rohit's future, the spotlight has also been on franchise captain KL Rahul 's uncertain situation.Rumors suggest that Rahul may not play again for LSG, following what appeared to be a reprimand from franchise owner Sanjiv Goenka after their defeat to Sunrisers Hyderabad.When asked about Rahul's future, Rhodes expressed relief that he wouldn't be responsible for making decisions regarding player retention.""Well, luckily, hypothetically, or in real life, that's as a fielding coach.

But I'm still really concerned about the role of the all-rounder, the importance of the role of the all-rounder in T20 cricket, and the Impact Player rule is certainly killing it,"" Rhodes added.Beyond the Impact Player debate, Rhodes also addressed the Right to Match (RTM) rule, which allows franchises to retain players by matching the highest bid made for them in the auction.While not overly concerned about RTM itself, Rhodes emphasized the importance of player retention for building team culture and consistency. He questioned the current limitations on the number of players a franchise can retain, arguing that losing a significant portion of the squad during mega auctions disrupts team dynamics and hinders long-term planning.The BCCI is yet to finalize the number of retentions and RTM cards for the upcoming IPL season. This decision carries significant weight, as franchises hold differing opinions.Teams like Kolkata Knight Riders and Sunrisers Hyderabad , enjoying recent success, favour retaining a larger core group of players. Conversely, teams like Punjab Kings prefer minimal retention, aiming for a fresh start and greater flexibility in the auction.","Lucknow Super Giants fielding coach Jonty Rhodes has expressed concerns over the Impact Player rule.

ROLL OF HONOUR

Golden Ball: Jithin MS (NEUFC)

Golden Boot: Noah Sadaoui (Kerala Blasters)

Golden Glove: Gurmeet Singh (NEUFC)

KOLKATA: In the end, it was a triumph NorthEast United FC seemed to have stolen straight from the page of Mohun Bagan 's script.It was history for them, their cup of joy --pure, maiden and magical. It was their goalkeeper Gurmeet Singh's turn to do a Vishal Kaith , pulling off two saves in the shootout to seal the deal.It was a what-could-have-been moment for Mohun Bagan SG as well.NorthEast United lifted the Durand Cup --their first trophy since their birth in Indian football a decade ago ---dramatically beating Mohun Bagan 4-3 in penalty shootout after coming back from 0-2 goal down to hold the defending champions 2-2 in regulation time at the Salt Lake Stadium here on Saturday.And how the Highlanders flourished on a stage which Mohun Bagan seemed to have made a part of their survival gene in this tournament. And how Bagan's art ofescapology failed to bear fruit in the most decisive stage of the tournament.In the back-to-back knockout matches leading to the final, Jose Molina's green-and maroon brigade made it a habit of surviving against the odds, clawing their way back from the jaws of death against Punjab FC and Bengaluru FC before seeing goalkeeper Vishal Kaith rising to the occasion and keeping his team afloat with two crucial in the penalty shootout on both occasions.The script underwent a complete change in the final. It was Mohun Bagan who claimed a 2-0 goal lead thanks to Jason Cummings' penalty in the 11th minute and Sahal Abdul Samad's first goal of the season four minutes into the first half injury time.Until then, it was smooth sailing for Mohun Bagan and their march to Durand Cup title No. 18 looked like theirs to lose. But NEUFC --with their co-owner John Abraham in attendance in the stands --turned the game on its head in a remarkable second-half resuscitation. Their coach Benali's introduction of Guillermo Fernandez and Louis Macarton paid off handsomely as the Highlanders took the wind out of Bagan's sails with two goals in a span of three minutes.Moroccan Alaaeddine Ajaraie reduced the margin, beating Vishal through his first post with a perfect right-footer in the 55th minute. Three minutes later, Ajaraie came calling again, this time sending a long cross from the left and Guillermo, following the ball's trajectory, met it with a sumptuous strike, giving the Bagan goalkeeper no chance to react.In a tale of two halves, NEUFC completely dominated the contest thereafter and when Dimitri Petratos --who came in the second half with Molina deciding to start with Greg Stewart --saw his scorcher miss the target by a whisker in the 87th minute, it was Bagan's first attempt at goal since Guillermo's goal, manifesting how the tide was turned.Yet, facing the third penalty shootout in as many matches, Vishal stood under the bar with the been-there-done that confidence. But his thunder was stolen by his opposite number in NEUFC.Bagan started the shootout ominously when Cummings blazed his shot over the bar, but referee Harish Kundu judged Gurmeet to have moved out of his line before the penalty and the Australian was spot on with his retaken kick. Lucky briefly seemed to be on the home team's side but Gurmeet came up with two stupendous saves, denying Liston Colaco and Subhasish Bose and setting his team on way to a history-oozing victory.",NorthEast United lift Durand Cup after beating defending champions Mohun Bagan 4-3 in penalty shootout.

Premier League: Declan Rice sent off as Arsenal held by Brighton,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/premier-league-declan-rice-sent-off-as-arsenal-held-by-brighton/articleshow/112952638.cms,"- Rice sees red -

NEW DELHI: Arsenal drew 1-1 with Brighton on Saturday after Declan Rice was controversially sent off in the Premier League match.Kai Havertz had put Arsenal ahead, but Rice was sent off in the second half for delaying the restart after fouling Joel Veltman.Brighton capitalized on their numerical advantage to equalize through Joao Pedro, halting Arsenal's perfect start to the season.The incident occurred at the Emirates Stadium, where Rice was shown a second yellow card for a minor act of kicking the ball away and not retreating promptly. The decision baffled Rice and drew the ire of Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, who sought clarification from the fourth official.Arsenal fans expressed their frustration with chants directed at referee Chris Kavanagh. ""You're not fit to referee,"" chanted Arsenal fans at Kavanagh.The Premier League later clarified that Rice's dismissal was due to 'delaying the restart'. The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) could not intervene as the decision involved a yellow card, not a straight red.Despite being down to ten men, Arsenal couldn't prevent Brighton from leveling the score.Joao Pedro's equalizer marked the end of Arsenal's winning streak, having started the season with victories against Wolves and Aston Villa. The draw was a setback in their bid to win the title for the first time since 2004.Rice's suspension means he will miss Arsenal's next Premier League match, a north London derby against Tottenham on September 15.Brighton, under new manager Fabian Hurzeler, extended their unbeaten run to three games. They followed up their recent 2-1 win against Manchester United with another solid performance.New Arsenal signing Raheem Sterling was present at the match, having joined on loan from Chelsea. Restricted by registration timelines, Sterling couldn't play but was warmly welcomed by the fans when his name was announced in the stadium.Bukayo Saka tormented Brighton defender Jack Hinshelwood with his pace and movement in the early stages, easing into space for a pair of shots that Brighton keeper Bart Verbruggen repelled.Ben White tested Verbruggen, who also denied Martin Odegaard as Arsenal swept forward in a red wave.Arsenal were nearly punished for failing to turn their pressure into a tangible reward when Yankuba Minteh's header forced a good save from David Raya.But Arteta's belief that the inconsistent Havertz can be an adequate striker for a team with title ambitions looked well placed in the 38th minute as the German broke the deadlock.Havertz came in for criticism after scoring just 13 times last season following his move from Chelsea.But he showed composure and quality to deftly chip over the on-rushing Verbruggen from the edge of the area after Saka punished Lewis Dunk's hesitancy with a clever flicked pass.Rice escaped with only a yellow card after the Arsenal midfielder crunched into Veltman, a decision that saw Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler booked for protesting.But Rice wasn't so fortunate in the 49th minute when he was dismissed after kicking the ball away and failing to retreat before a Brighton free-kick.Rice had just conceded a foul with a challenge on Veltman, whose kick out at the midfielder in the aftermath looked the more significant offence.Pedro rubbed salt into Arsenal's wounds with his 58th minute equaliser.Dunk's superb pass split the Gunners defence and Minteh sprinted clear for a shot that was pushed out by Raya to Pedro, who fired home from close-range.It was the first goal Arsenal had conceded this season, but they should have regained the lead when Havertz broke free for a low shot that was too close to Verbruggen, who saved Saka's sliding effort seconds later.In a frantic finale, Raya saved Yasin Ayari's close-range effort and Carlos Baleba smashed over the bar as 10-man Arsenal held on.","Arsenal drew 1-1 with Brighton after Declan Rice was controversially sent off.

Novak Djokovic defeat at US Open leaves era of golden generation at crossroads,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/novak-djokovic-defeat-leaves-era-of-golden-generation-at-crossroads/articleshow/112955569.cms,"NEW DELHI: For the first time in over two decades, the Grand Slam titles of the year will not be adorned by any member of tennis's esteemed ""Big Three"" – Roger Federer Rafael Nadal , and Novak Djokovic – marking a significant shift in the landscape of the sport.This unexpected turn of events was cemented after Novak Djokovic, a 24-time major winner, faced a surprising third-round exit at the US Open , his earliest departure from the tournament since 2006.Djokovic's loss to 28th-ranked Alexei Popyrin not only ended his title defence but also left him without a Grand Slam victory for the first time in seven years, a stark contrast to his illustrious career.The ""Big Three"" have dominated the Grand Slam scene since Federer's first win at Wimbledon in 2003, collectively securing 66 out of 84 Slams up to this year's Wimbledon.Federer, who retired in 2022 with 20 major titles, and Nadal, with 22 Slams, have been central figures in this golden generation.However, Nadal's recent years have been marred by injuries, limiting his appearances and victories, culminating in a first-round defeat at Roland Garros and an absence from Wimbledon.With Nadal's ranking dropping to 154th in the world, speculation about his retirement is inevitable.Djokovic, at 37, remains tied with Margaret Court for the all-time record of 24 Grand Slam titles.Despite his ambitions, Djokovic's year has been challenging, with losses that have seen him relinquish his Australian Open title and his world number one ranking.An injury forced his withdrawal from the French Open , and he suffered a defeat at Wimbledon, further indicating a possible decline in his once-unassailable dominance in the sport.Carlos Alcaraz , 16 years Djokovic's junior, has emerged as a new force, claiming the French Open title and defending his Wimbledon crown, signalling a shift towards a younger generation of champions.Djokovic's Olympic gold in Paris stands as a highlight in a year that has otherwise seen his aura of invincibility fade.The US Open has historically been a tournament of surprises, with 14 different men's champions since 2000, underscoring the unpredictability and competitive nature of the event. Djokovic and Alcaraz, both coming off their emotional highs from the Olympics, admitted to less-than-ideal preparations for the US Open, a factor that their competitors have not overlooked.","For the first time in over two decades, the Grand Slam titles of the year will not be adorned by any member of tennis's esteemed ""Big Three"" Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.

Aryna Sabalenka shrugs off late US Open start to battle past Ekaterina Alexandrova,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/aryna-sabalenka-shrugs-off-late-us-open-start-to-battle-past-ekaterina-alexandrova/articleshow/112942654.cms,"Aryna Sabalenka , who finished as the runner-up in the previous year's tournament, bounced back from a challenging start to secure a 2-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory over Ekaterina Alexandrova , the 29th seed, in the third round of the US Open .

As a result, she conceded the first set to Alexandrova in a mere 33 minutes.""I don't know what I did, I was just trying to stay low, put as many balls as I can back on that side. She played incredible tennis in the first set. It was really tough to change it,"" Sabalenka said.The 26-year-old rapidly regained her form and secured a break to establish a 3-1 advantage in the subsequent set. From that point forward, she never relinquished her lead.""I'm really happy I was able to turn around this match and get this really difficult win,"" said Sabalenka, as quoted by Reuters.Sabalenka experienced an unexpected setback when Alexandrova broke her serve, despite Sabalenka's commanding 5-0 lead in the final set. However, the Belarusian quickly regained her composure and delivered a decisive blow to her visibly tiring opponent. With a powerful backhand winner, Sabalenka sealed the match, much to the delight of the dedicated fans who remained in the stands until the very end.""Thanks so much for staying that late,"" Sabalenka said as the clock neared 2 a.m.","Aryna Sabalenka beat Ekaterina Alexandrova 2-6 6-1, 6-2 in the third round of the U.S. Open.
