Proposed Trade Package

Why This Trade Makes Sense

For the Lakers:

For the Celtics:

Theare gearing up for a crucial offseason after a disappointing first-round exit in the 2025 NBA Playoffs. With LeBron James and Luka Doncic leading the charge, the front office is exploring bold moves to strengthen the roster‚Äîincluding a potential blockbuster trade with archrivals, the Boston Celtics .Fresh off their 2024 NBA championship, the Celtics face a challenging offseason. Financial constraints and an aging core may force Boston to shake up their roster.""The rest of the league is bracing for some level of change to the Celtics' roster this offseason,"" ESPN‚Äôs Shams Charania reported. ""Sources have been telling me for weeks now that the Celtics will be exploring trade options.""According to Dean Simon of the Sporting News , this opens the door for the Lakers to target a key Celtics star: two-time NBA champion Jrue Holiday.Jrue Holiday, a two-time All-Star and six-time All-Defensive Team selection, brings elite defense and veteran leadership‚Äîqualities the Los Angeles Lakers desperately need. Here‚Äôs how he could impact the team:- Defensive Anchor: Holiday‚Äôs ability to guard multiple positions would mask Doncic‚Äôs defensive limitations.- Playoff Experience: A proven winner, he‚Äôs averaged 11.1 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 3.9 assists this season.- Leadership: His intangibles make him an ideal fit alongside James and Doncic.To acquire Holiday, the Lakers may offer a package centered around Austin Reaves, who averaged 20.2 PPG this season. The deal could include:- Austin Reaves (20.2 PPG scorer)- Rookie forward Dalton Knecht- Jarred Vanderbilt- Draft capital- Adds a lockdown defender and playoff-tested veteran.- Balances the roster without sacrificing too much scoring.- Sheds Holiday‚Äôs $37.2 million player option for 2027-28.- Gains a young scorer in Reaves and future assets.Landing Jrue Holiday could propel the Los Angeles Lakers back into title contention. His defensive prowess and championship pedigree align perfectly with the team‚Äôs win-now mentality. As Dean Simon noted in the original report, this move might be the missing piece for Los Angeles to chase their 18th NBA championship.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors could chase $186 million Milwaukee Bucks superstar to form Big 3 with Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler With the Celtics potentially open for business, the Lakers have a rare chance to weaken a rival while bolstering their own roster.

What is a Technical Foul? NBA Playoff fines and suspensions explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/what-is-a-technical-foul-nba-playoff-fines-and-suspensions-explained/articleshow/120808487.cms,"Technical Foul NBA. Image via: Getty Images | NBA

What Exactly is a Technical Foul?

Top 16 Funniest Technical FOUL Calls in the NBA

a non-contact behavioral infraction

Ignoring Referee Warnings: After an official issues a warning, any repeat offense by a player, coach, or bench member will result in a technical foul.





Disrespectful Communication: Arguing with referees, table officials, or opponents in a hostile manner, or using language or gestures meant to provoke the crowd or the other team.





Taunting or Baiting Opponents: Actions such as staring down a rival or making mocking gestures after scoring can lead to a call.





Obstructing Vision: Placing hands close to an opponent‚Äôs eyes, even defensively, is prohibited due to the risk of eye injury.





Excessive Elbow Swinging: Players who swing elbows to clear space without contact may still get called for endangering others.





Delaying the Game: This includes:



Flopping or Faking Fouls: Dramatically exaggerating contact to deceive referees is now punishable under updated FIBA rules.





Hanging on the Rim: A player may momentarily hold the rim after a dunk, but extended hanging, like doing a chin-up, is penalized unless it‚Äôs to prevent injury.





Goaltending on a Free Throw: If a defender interferes with a final free throw, the point is awarded, followed by a technical foul.



Coaches and Technical Fouls

FIBA Rules Explained: Technical Foul

Two direct technical fouls, or





One direct and two indirect (from bench behavior), or





Three indirect technical fouls.



How the penalty works

The opposing team is awarded one free throw.





The ball returns to the point of interruption. For example, if Team A had the ball, it remains theirs after the technical shot.





If the infraction happens during a live ball, play is stopped immediately, but actions like successful shots or fouls before the whistle still count.



Clean slate for Playoff contenders

Technical Foul limits and suspensions in the Playoffs

After 7 technical fouls, a player receives a one-game suspension.





For every two additional technicals after that, the suspension increases by one game. So, if a player reaches 9, they miss two games.



Financial consequences of Technical Fouls

Technicals 1‚Äì5: $2,000 each





Technicals 6‚Äì10: $3,000 each





Technicals 11‚Äì15: $4,000 each





Technical 16: $5,000 fine + one-game suspension





Every additional tech after 16: $5,000





Every 2 additional techs (18, 20, etc.): $5,000 + suspension



Technicals 1‚Äì2: $2,000 each





Technicals 3‚Äì4: $3,000 each





Technicals 5‚Äì6: $4,000 each





Technical 7: $5,000 + one-game suspension





Each extra tech: $5,000





Every 2 after that: $5,000 + one-game suspension



Ejections and pay losses

First ejection: $2,000 fine





Each additional ejection: +$2,000 more than the last

In basketball, the pursuit of victory should be guided by fairness, respect, and adherence to the rules. There‚Äôs a huge rule book for the players, aiming primarily to avoid any potential disruption and to maintain a fair game. But when players, coaches, or even team personnel violate that spirit‚Äî deliberately or repeatedly‚Äî they can be charged with a technical foul. A technical foul arises when conduct on or off the court goes against the game‚Äôs integrity, even if it doesn‚Äôt involve physical contact.A technical foul is considered. It's different from personal or unsporting fouls and can be called for a wide range of misconduct. Here's a clear breakdown of behaviors that lead to a technical foul:-Touching the ball after it passes through the basket.-Preventing quick inbound plays.-Stalling before a free throw.Coaches aren‚Äôt entirely immune. A head coach can be disqualified from a game if they accumulate:When a technical foul is called:One of the most important distinctions is that players start the playoffs with a fresh record when it comes to technical fouls. As soon as the regular season ends, all accumulated technical fouls are reset to zero. That means even if a player racked up 15 technical fouls during the regular season, they won‚Äôt carry any of that baggage into the playoffs.This rule has a major strategic implication. It allows key players to avoid suspensions that could have otherwise affected critical playoff games. However, the freedom isn‚Äôt limitless.While players do get a reset, the NBA puts strict limits on how many technical fouls are tolerated in the postseason:Fines also scale depending on how many infractions a player racks up. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown:Regular Season FinesPlayoff FinesEjections are treated separately:It‚Äôs worth noting that a suspended player does not get paid for that specific gameAlso Read: Is LeBron James retiring?

Will Jalen Brunson‚Äôs return be enough?

Thefind themselves in an unexpectedly tight playoff battle against the Detroit Pistons . Despite entering as the higher seed, the Knicks have struggled to put away their opponents. With Game 6 looming, all eyes are onand Josh Hart after their injury scares in Game 5. Here‚Äôs the latest on their availability and what it means for the crucial matchup.Good news for Knicks fans: Jalen Brunson is officially off the injury report and will play in Game 6. The star guard eased concerns after Game 5 by stating despite rolling his ankle late in the contest. This isn‚Äôt the first time Brunson has dealt with ankle issues‚Äîhe suffered a similar injury against the Lakers in March‚Äîbut he appears fully recovered this time.Josh Hart, who also exited Game 5 early, is also cleared to play. In fact, the New York Knicks have no players listed on their injury report, giving them a full-strength roster for the must-win game.Meanwhile, the Pistons aren‚Äôt as fortunate.

His absence weakens Detroit‚Äôs rebounding and interior defense, which could prove costly against a healthy Knicks squad.Game 5 was a missed opportunity for New York. Jalen Brunson and Hart‚Äôs late-game absence allowed Cade Cunningham to take over, securing a Pistons victory. Now, with both stars available, the Knicks have a chance to redeem themselves.Here‚Äôs what the Knicks must improve to avoid a Game 7:- Shot selection ‚Äì The Pistons have forced New York into inefficient offensive performances at times.- Free throw shooting ‚Äì Converting at the line could be the difference in a close game.- Defensive intensity ‚Äì Containing Cunningham and the Pistons‚Äô role players will be crucial.The Knicks have the talent to finish this series tonight, but execution will be key. If Jalen Brunson and Hart stay healthy and the team cleans up its mistakes, they should advance. However, if Detroit‚Äôs defense continues to disrupt New York‚Äôs rhythm, this series could go the distance.Pistons fans will hope Stewart gets cleared at the last minute, but as of now, the Knicks hold the health advantage.

Miami Grand Prix promises moments that will define the 2025 season



The 2025 Formula 1 season is turned on its head this week as the Miami Grand Prix prepares for its third edition, and Oscar Piastri finds himself in the limelight. Having made a scorching start to the season, the McLaren driver has taken the championship lead and the limelight squarely on his shoulders. With pressure building, internal team tensions, and an uncertain circuit, Miami may prove to be a turning point in the championship fight.Oscar Piastri‚Äôs rise to the top of the 2025 Formula 1 standings has been nothing short of remarkable. The Australian driver has collected 97 points from a possible 108 in the opening five races and now finds himself leading the title race for the first time since joining the grid. His latest win has not only solidified his standing but has also triggered a shift in the dynamic at McLaren.Having fallen behind Lando Norris at the start of the season, Oscar Piastri has now turned things around with his consistent performances after Melbourne. But success is followed by even more pressure. The 24-year-old now has another test in front of him‚Äîkeeping his place against veteran rivals like Max Verstappen and his team-mate Lando Norris.Lando Norris has suffered a frustrating p disappointing Bahrain and Saudi Arabia performances, denying him the early momentum in the championship. The Miami Grand Prix offers him a golden opportunity to get back on track, though, especially as this was the circuit where he took victory exactly one year ago. To reproduce the performance would not only silence his detractors but also reaffirm his title ambitions as well.The Miami International Autodrome is renowned for first-turn carnage, and with the positions being what they are, we might be in for a crash that opens up the championship wide. Red Bull Racing's Max Verstappen, never one to hold back from fighting for himself in tight battles, might take a very aggressive line if he can see the McLaren drivers getting away from him.A throwback to last year reminds us‚ÄîSergio Perez nearly crashed into Verstappen at Turn 1. This time around, fireworks are also on the agenda, particularly with the McLaren duo fighting team dominance and overall leadership.Even as the focus falls on the next generation now, seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton might prove a surprise package on the weekend. The recent boost for Ferrari with Charles Leclerc's Saudi Arabian podium performance indicates the team might have hit upon a harmony of race pace‚Äîthough qualifying continues to be a vulnerable link.Hamilton, who hasn't caught a glimpse of the podium this year, is well known for saving the day when it counts.

It‚Äôs a direct reference to Katt Williams‚Äô viral appearance on Sharpe‚Äôs podcastearlier this year, the same interview where Katt claimed he declined party invites from Diddy and hinted at ‚Äúindustry weirdness.‚ÄùBut let‚Äôs set the record straight: Katt never mentioned Shannon Sharpe in that context. He threw shots at plenty of names, but Sharpe wasn‚Äôt one of them. Still, folks online are connecting dots that just aren‚Äôt there, especially since Katt and Sharpe have actually remained on good terms since the episode aired.Despite the online explosion, there‚Äôs absolutely zero evidence backing this tweet. Shannon Sharpe hasn‚Äôt responded (and likely won‚Äôt), and no credible outlets have touched the story. This feels a lot more like fan fiction than fact.And since the tweet‚Äôs gone and wasn‚Äôt posted from a verified account, there‚Äôs no way to know if it ever existed in the first place. What we‚Äôre left with? A bunch of viral whispers, half-screenshotted ‚Äúproof,‚Äù and a lot of people making reckless allegations based on deleted posts.Also read - Who is Gabriella Zuniga?

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals are without their regular skipper Sanju Samson once again as they face Mumbai Indians at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on Thursday.Samson, who has been out with a side strain, is still not match-fit, and head coach Rahul Dravid confirmed the team is monitoring his condition closely.Speaking ahead of the game, Dravid explained, ‚ÄúSanju is recovering well, but side strains can be tricky. We don‚Äôt want to rush him back and risk long-term damage. We‚Äôre taking it one day at a time and will decide based on how he responds.‚ÄùSamson has already missed three consecutive matches, including the ones against Lucknow Super Giants, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, and Gujarat Titans.In his absence, Riyan Parag is leading the side and even won the toss today, choosing to bowl first.Parag said the team hopes to make use of possible dew later in the game.‚ÄúWe‚Äôve kept things simple. Rahul sir's message has been to take one game at a time and play with freedom,‚Äù he said.Parag also confirmed a few forced changes: Wanindu Hasaranga is out with a niggle and Sandeep Sharma is nursing a broken finger. Kumar Kartikeya and Akash Madhwal come into the XI.Sanju Samson‚Äôs absence is clearly being felt, especially with RR entering a crucial phase of the tournament. His leadership, calm presence, and middle-order batting are key to the Royals‚Äô balance. However, the franchise is choosing caution over haste, keeping his long-term fitness in mind.With youngsters like Vaibhav Suryavanshi stepping up and experienced players like Jofra Archer returning, Rajasthan Royals are hoping to maintain momentum even without their regular skipper.As fans wait eagerly for Samson‚Äôs return, the Royals march forward under Parag‚Äôs leadership, hoping to keep their playoff dreams alive.Yashasvi Jaiswal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Nitish Rana, Riyan Parag(c), Dhruv Jurel(w), Shimron Hetmyer, Jofra Archer, Maheesh Theekshana, Kumar Kartikeya, Akash Madhwal, Fazalhaq FarooqiShubham Dubey, Tushar Deshpande, Kunal Singh Rathore, Yudhvir Singh Charak, Kwena MaphakaRyan Rickelton(w), Rohit Sharma, Will Jacks, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya(c), Naman Dhir, Corbin Bosch, Deepak Chahar, Trent Boult, Jasprit BumrahRaj Bawa, Satyanarayana Raju, Robin Minz, Reece Topley, Karn Sharma","Rajasthan Royals face Mumbai Indians at Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on Thursday.

Bill Belichick‚Äôs love life just got tackled harder than a quarterback on 4th down. The legendary NFL coach, who‚Äôs been quietly dating 24-year-old Jordon Hudson, suddenly found himself in the middle of a viral storm not because of football, but because of an interview gone sideways. After Hudson stepped in during his CBS sit-down, former Patriots stars Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman jumped to her defense. But then came the curveball: Belichick‚Äôs own daughter-in-law wasn‚Äôt buying any of it and she didn‚Äôt hold back.It all started with a now-viral CBS interview where Bill Belichick was chatting it up with Tony Dokoupil. But before the convo could get too far, Hudson swooped in mid-shoot and, according to many viewers, delayed and disrupted the segment. The internet didn‚Äôt waste time calling her out, many thought she was being overly controlling, acting more like a PR manager than a girlfriend.Enter the bros: Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman. On their podcast, they tackled the backlash head-on. Edelman argued that Jordon was doing exactly what a PR rep would do, jumping in to shut down unexpected questions and keep the interview on track.Edelman said.Even comedian Nikki Glaser chimed in with her support on Instagram, saying Hudson was just protecting her man like any good publicist would. In other words, Team Hudson had some strong voices backing her play.Just when things started to sound smoothed over, Jennifer Schmitt‚ÄîBelichick‚Äôs daughter-in-law and wife of his son Stephen, dropped her own take in the comments section. And let‚Äôs just say, she wasn‚Äôt buying thenarrative.‚Äù she wrote, shutting down the defense from Gronk, Edelman. The message was clear: whatever role Jordon thinks she‚Äôs playing, it‚Äôs rubbing some peopleclose to Belichick the wrong way.After days of speculation, Belichick himself finally released a statement defending Hudson. He claimed the interview had gone off track from its original intent, which, according to him, was to talk about his new book. When off-topic questions kept creeping in, he said Hudson stepped in to redirect the conversation.CBS, however, wasn‚Äôt about to let that narrative fly unchallenged. In their own statement, the network said there were no preconditions for the interview, no topic restrictions, no off-limits agreements. In fact, they claimed it was all confirmed with Belichick‚Äôs publisher before and after the shoot.So where does this leave everyone? Jordon Hudson is clearly more than just a girlfriend, she‚Äôs involved in Belichick‚Äôs business life, too. But the friction with his family, especially Jennifer Schmitt, shows there might be more going on behind the scenes than a bad interview edit.Also read - Bill Belichick net worth 2025: How much is the NFL legend worth and can Jordon Hudson get a share?","Jordon Hudson, 24, interrupted Bill Belichick's CBS interview.

Shohei Ohtani shares a heartwarming message for his newborn daughter

""I am so grateful to my loving wife who gave birth to our healthy, beautiful daughter. To my daughter, thank you for making us very nervous yet super anxious parents.""

Shohei Ohtani needs no introduction when it comes to talking about home runs and phenomenal fan following across the globe. The Dodgers‚Äô two-way star recently made a comeback with his bat after a drought of home runs during the ongoing major league season. He went on to embrace the bliss of fatherhood with his beloved wife, Mamiko Tanaka , in April 2025. Recently, the Japanese superstar opened up on fatherhood, his little daughter, and his home run against the Miami Marlins that went on to bring a broad smile to the Dodgers fans‚Äô faces.Managing both father duties and the responsibilities of representing the 2024 defending champions during the ongoing season is not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, but Dodgers‚Äô popular designated hitter Shohei Ohtani is on his way to achieving both. After embracing the bliss of fatherhood with his wife, Mamiko Tanaka, Shohei Ohtani silenced all his critics who were busy analyzing his performance for the past few games.During a recent clash between the Miami Marlins and the Los Angeles Dodgers , Ohtani struck a home run, creating a 13-run deficit against the opposition team. He opened up on fatherhood via an Instagram post, which even had a heartwarming message for his newborn daughter.The buzz around Ohtani‚Äôs daughter‚Äôs name has been doing the rounds on social media, but as of now there has been no update from the Los Angeles Dodgers star. The 30-year-old baseball athlete prefers to keep his professional and personal life very separate and away from the media glare. He had updated about his marriage with his wife, Mamiko Tanaka, back in 2024 on social media. Shohei Ohtani announced the new addition to the family through a heart-touching post on Instagram. The post consisted of a picture of both Ohtani and Tanaka holding their daughter‚Äôs feet.Also Read: Dodgers manager Dave Roberts makes a bold prediction about Shohei Ohtani‚Äôs performance after embracing fatherhood","Shohei Ohtani shares a heartwarming message for his newborn daughter.

Can Anthony Stolarz solve the Goaltending Woes of the Toronto Maple Leafs?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/can-anthony-stolarz-solve-the-goaltending-woes-of-the-toronto-maple-leafs/articleshow/120799681.cms,"Image Via Twitter



Anthony Stolarz in the Maple Leafs' showdown

The Toronto Maple Leafs ‚Äô history of goaltending reveals a collage of inconsistency and heartache that has derailed several promising playoff runs. This season, however, the goaltending department has had a new focus: Anthony Stolarz . Very little postseason credentialing, along with a backup's r√©sum√©, was deemed favorable for a player to lead a franchise under the weight of a 57-year-old Stanley Cup drought . However, with the performances he has put up for the current 2025 playoffs, one pertinent question arises: Will Stolarz finally be the dependable goaltender Toronto has needed now for so many years?Anthony Stolarz arrived in Toronto after a low-profile backup role to Sergei Bobrovsky in Florida, with his only playoff memory being of mop-up duty during the 2024 Stanley Cup Final. With the Maple Leafs bending Ilya Samsonov, they saw Stolarz as a candidate to partner with and perhaps mentor Joseph Woll. A two-year contract was penned, becoming a low-risk scenario that could now pay off disproportionately.Stolarz quickly established himself as a calming presence with a 21-8-3 regular-season record and an impressive .926 save percentage. His presence was truly missed during a stretch of 23 games recovering from knee surgery, where the team wobbled in form. Upon his return, he steadied the ship and led them toward postseason readiness.As of the ongoing playoff series against Ottawa, Stolarz has been the fulcrum of Toronto's performance. Having gone through three overtime games so far, where he won two, he has been able to rise to the occasion in such moments. When juxtaposed with goaltenders past, especially in the case of James Campbell and Elijah Samsonov-type netminders, whose errors during the crunch time of the playoffs proved fatal to the Leafs, Stolarz's stability appears to be the greatest contrast.The last couple of games have not done him any favors, though. Stolarz put up an .810 save percentage in Game 4 and a .882 in Game 5, numbers that hint at possible fatigue or a shift in momentum. With that being said, with Stolarz's overall playoff numbers of 3-2, .899 SV%, and 2.25 GAA, Toronto is still in contention.Stolarz's edge, passion, and tenacity are certainly there, as shown by the moment he had with Riddell Greig in Game 2. His teammates appreciate this grit and recognize him as a competitor and a leader. His fierce presence in front of the net and refusal to be intimidated are signs of a new breed of Maple Leafs goaltender.Also Read: Anthony Stolarz Stands Tall: Big saves and bigger hits fuel Leafs‚Äô playoff win over Senators In simple terms, Anthony Stolarz has not simply stopped pucks but has turned the conventional goaltending story of Toronto on its head. Thus, should he maintain it throughout Game 6, perhaps the Maple Leafs will turn the page on all the last years of harried existence.","Anthony Stolarz has been the fulcrum of Toronto's performance in the ongoing playoff series against Ottawa.

The Indiana Pacers edged out a dramatic 119-118 overtime victory against the Milwaukee Bucks . While Tyrese Haliburton 's game-winning shot over Giannis Antetokounmpo lit up Gainbridge Fieldhouse, the postgame headlines were stolen by a courtside altercation between Giannis and Haliburton's father, John. Fans online are not happy with John‚Äôs move, as many are asking the NBA to ban him from the playoffs.Giannis Antetokounmpo was making his way off the court when John Haliburton approached him, waving a towel with his son's face on it and allegedly yelling, ‚ÄúThis is what we do.‚Äù The bold move did not sit well with the two-time MVP, who interpreted the act as a blatant show of disrespect. Giannis responded, and the two ended up in a tense face-to-face standoff that required players and staff from both benches to intervene.Giannis later addressed the confrontation: ‚ÄúI believe in being humble in victory. That‚Äôs who I am,‚Äù he said in his postgame comments. ‚ÄúSome people will say when you win the game, you can talk s___ and say it‚Äôs a green light for you to be disrespectful. I disagree.

Addressing the incident in his postgame press conference, he took accountability for his father‚Äôs actions. ‚ÄúAs far as the incident between Giannis and my pops, I had no idea until I got to the back and was shown the video. I don‚Äôt agree with what transpired... I don‚Äôt think that my pops was in the right at all there.‚ÄùFans online quickly shared their thoughts on the matter. Many demand a ban on John Haliburton from the NBA games as a form of punishment.‚ÄúBetter be banned for the rest of the playoffs for this dumb s*it,‚Äù one fan wrote on X.‚ÄúFather should be banned for rest of playoffs,‚Äù another echoed the same.‚ÄúFather a bad example of sportsmanship,‚Äù another wrote.‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad i saw this angle cause Hali dad was deff in the wrong for taunting Giannis after a big loss like that,‚Äù another shared.‚ÄúWhat a clown,‚Äù one fan condemned the action of John.‚ÄúWhy is he seeking out a 7 foot Greek god like that.

Remembering Gianna Bryant: A tribute to her legacy amid defaced murals and tough times



On Thursday, May 1, 2025, Vanessa Bryant marked what would have been her daughter Gianna ‚ÄúGigi‚Äù Bryant‚Äôs 19th birthday with a touching Instagram post that resonated far beyond social media. Accompanied by a powerful image of Gigi in her basketball uniform, the post was a raw and emotional tribute from a mother who continues to carry the weight of an unimaginable loss. The moment was made even more emotional as it came just days after a beloved mural of Gigi and her father, Kobe Bryant, was vandalized in Los Angeles.From Los Angeles to global basketball circles, the name Gianna Bryant , known affectionately as ‚ÄúGigi‚Äù and ‚ÄúMambacita,‚Äù still echoes with deep meaning. On Thursday morning, Vanessa Bryant shared a birthday message on Instagram that read, ‚ÄúHappy birthday, Gigi! Mommy loves and misses you more than I could ever express. I love you Gianna. ‚ù§Ô∏è19 ‚ôâÔ∏è 5/1 #Mambacita.‚Äù It was a simple yet deeply moving tribute that quickly garnered love and support from fans, athletes, and brands across the sports world.Gigi, the daughter of NBA legend Kobe Bryant , was just 13 when she and her father tragically died in a helicopter crash on January 26, 2020, along with seven others.Nicknamed ‚ÄúMambacita,‚Äù Gigi was seen as the heir to Kobe‚Äôs legacy. He even trademarked the name for her in December 2019, recognizing her growing talent and fierce passion for basketball.Over the years, more than 330 murals have popped up across California honoring Kobe and Gigi. But just days before Gigi‚Äôs birthday, one of the most beloved murals in L.A., a portrait of the father and daughter, was defaced with black paint. The timing hit hard. It rattled fans and added even more emotional weight to a week that was already tough for Vanessa, who also has a birthday coming up on May 5.To honor Gigi, Nike released a special edition ‚ÄúMambacita‚Äù Kobe 9 sneaker on May 1, designed in partnership with the Bryant family.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

NEW DELHI: Yuzvendra Chahal has been completely left out of BCCI‚Äôs annual player contracts, raising serious questions about his future with Team India. His last international appearance came in 2023 against the West Indies in Lauderhill. Since then, he hasn‚Äôt featured in India colours and appears to be out of the selectors‚Äô plans.Is this the end of Chahal‚Äôs journey with Team India?Astrologer Greenstone Lobo weighs in on the sudden dip in Chahal‚Äôs career, shedding light on the cosmic factors behind the roadblock the leg-spinner is currently facing.""Yuzvendra Chahal was born in 1990, when planet Pluto had just entered its own house at zero degrees ‚Äî an extremely powerful position. Besides that, he also has Chiron very strongly placed in his chart. Saturn is also strong, and Neptune was in deep exaltation ‚Äî another extremely powerful combination. These planetary positions made him a great player for the country. Of course, he has performed very well ‚Äî delivering wonderful, joyous moments for Indian cricket. He has also been a fantastic champion for his IPL teams. All this has been possible because he was born in 1990 under such a powerful astrological alignment.""Now, talking about the current roadblock in his career ‚Äî why has he hit a low point? The main reason is that Pluto, the most significant planet in Chahal‚Äôs chart, has suddenly entered the ‚ÄúGrey Lizard Avatar.‚Äù This avatar signifies transformation and change, often painful in nature. That‚Äôs why this phase is negative for him, and it explains why he hasn‚Äôt been offered a central contract. Apart from that, he‚Äôs also facing intense competition. If you look at the current crop of players, Chahal ‚Äî who is already 34 and will soon turn 35 ‚Äî is up against younger talents born in the mid-1990s and 2000s. Take for example Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav . While it's not a like-for-like comparison, both are excellent spinners. Axar, in particular, has grown immensely. Both were born in 1994, and their planetary combinations are slightly stronger than Chahal‚Äôs. They have Neptune in an even deeper exaltation, and Pluto is also more powerful in their charts.""Additionally, they have Planet X in a formidable position. So multiple astrological indicators suggest that they‚Äôre the ones poised to take over. And we‚Äôre not just talking about current players. Even the future looks packed with promising talent. Look at the ongoing IPL ‚Äî fresh names are emerging. Someone like Vipraj Nigam has a phenomenal horoscope and could break into the Indian team. Another example is Suhas Sharma, who also has a strong astrological chart and might make it big.""Vipraj Nigam, especially, is not just a spinner ‚Äî he‚Äôs an all-rounder. He can bat well too. His chart shows that his peak time is yet to come. He might get a central contract in a year or so and could enjoy a long stint. So, selectors are also thinking long term. Since Chahal is already 35 and may not be part of the next World Cup, that‚Äôs likely another reason for his exclusion. There are enough reasons astrologically and practically for this phase in his career.""But is this the end of Yuzvendra Chahal? Not at all. One important trait about Chahal is his dedication to his craft. While others may branch out, he has stuck to his role as a bowler ‚Äî consistently delivering results. He‚Äôll continue doing that and is likely to excel in the IPL and other major tournaments.""Not just that ‚Äî post his playing career, expect Chahal to shine in new roles. He could feature in international leagues, and with his Jupiter exalted, he has the makings of a brilliant commentator. He‚Äôs already popular on social media and has a knack for humor and content creation. In fact, with his strong planetary placements, he could even become a great coach, guide, speaker, or writer. His exalted Jupiter gives him ‚Äúguru‚Äù energy ‚Äî the traits of a mentor. So no, Chahal is not going anywhere. You'll see him continue for a few more years ‚Äî both as a player and beyond that in new avatars,"" Lobo said.",Yuzvendra Chahal has been completely left out of BCCI‚Äôs annual player contracts.

Winnipeg Jets deliver powerful win against the St. Louis Blues

The Winnipeg Jets have come out strong in a recent game against the St. Louis Blues . This comes after the team faced ongoing backlash from the fans and critics alike, but they were able to silence them after a power-packed performance. With Game 5, the Jets ended the match with a 5-3 on the scoreboard. They are therefore leading the series with a 3-2 score.The match commenced with the score tied 2-2, and the Winnipeg Jets had the pressure to deliver a performance that would silence the critics. Mark Scheifele , their star center, had to exit the game after the first period. That is when Vladislav Namestnik stepped up and delivered a goal against the Blues. Additionally, performers like Nino Niederreiter , Mason Appleton and Adam Lowry were at the top of their game.Post the match, Adam Lowry captain of the Winnipeg Jets shared at the podium, ‚ÄúSometimes when you lose your No. 1 center, you lose a key piece to your lineup, there can be a bit of a sag, an emotional letdown. But you know, I thought the guys really rallied around it. Coming in the intermission and finding out he‚Äôs not coming back, guys were upbeat. Guys needed to step up.‚ÄùAt the same time, Jets coach Scott Arniel shared, ""We were physical. We were battling. Competing. Doing all the things we have to do to get ourselves going.

Poll What aspect of Suryakumar Yadav's journey do you find most inspiring? Adapting to change in the game Consistency in performance Overcoming setbacks

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians batter Suryakumar Yadav recently opened up about his debut season with the franchise in 2011, revealing that he ""barely slept"" the night before his first game. Suryakumar rose to prominence during the 2011‚Äì12 Ranji Trophy season, finishing as Mumbai‚Äôs top scorer with 754 runs in nine matches. His stellar domestic form earned him a place in the Mumbai Indians squad that same year.He made his IPL debut for Mumbai Indians in the 2012 season, playing against Pune Warriors at the Wankhede Stadium. However, his first outing was short-lived as he was dismissed for a duck‚Äîthe only game he featured in that season.The following year, he moved to Kolkata Knight Riders and became a key figure in their middle order, playing a significant role in their 2014 title win.""I barely slept the night before my debut for Mumbai Indians - went to bed around 4 or 5 in the morning. There was so much excitement. Playing for a franchise brings a different kind of buzz. I was just enjoying the moment, thinking about stepping onto the field for warm-up and as soon as I did, I was already sweating. It felt really good,‚Äù Suryakumar shared on JioHotstar‚Äôs special show, The Suryakumar Yadav Experience.In 2018, he returned to Mumbai Indians and enjoyed a breakout season, scoring 512 runs and establishing himself as a mainstay in the batting lineup. His consistent performances over the next two years were instrumental in MI‚Äôs title-winning campaigns and eventually led to his long-awaited India call-up.‚ÄúIn 2018, I didn‚Äôt expect to open. I didn‚Äôt in the first two games, but then the team management came to me and said they wanted me to take on that responsibility. I was keen, so I embraced it. From there, it was up to me to make the most of the opportunity. I didn‚Äôt overthink it. Having played all my cricket in Mumbai, I was familiar with the conditions at Wankhede and the pitches. I just kept playing and practicing. I didn‚Äôt expect to have a season with 500 runs as my previous seasons never went beyond 200, but this felt different.‚ÄùHe also recalled being a keen observer during the tense 2019 IPL final against Chennai Super Kings, which Mumbai won by a solitary run. Though not directly involved in the last-over discussions, he had a close view of the decisive moment. ‚ÄúI was standing at a distance when Rohit and Malinga were talking. Malinga just said, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll do it.‚Äô And he did. That moment taught me how important calmness is in such pressure situations.‚ÄùOne of the toughest phases in his journey came in 2020, when he was overlooked for India‚Äôs tour of Australia despite strong performances.‚ÄúEveryone thought I would be selected. Even overseas players were saying the same. When I didn‚Äôt see my name in the squad, I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone for 2-3 days. I didn‚Äôt practice either. Mahela and Zaheer could see that something was wrong,‚Äù he recalled.From 2021 onwards, Suryakumar evolved his T20 batting approach to keep pace with the changing demands of the game. ‚ÄúEarlier, I was batting at a strike rate of 140‚Äì150. But the game changed. So I started practicing different shots to stay ahead of the bowlers and captains. I focused on areas where I could score with less risk. My century this season against Sunrisers Hyderabad came because of that practice.‚ÄùSuryakumar stands as one of India‚Äôs most reliable and innovative batters in the shortest format. He was a part of the triumphant Indian squad at the 2024 T20 World Cup and now leads the national T20 side following Rohit Sharma‚Äôs retirement. Across 160 IPL matches, he has amassed over 4,000 runs, including two centuries and 27 half-centuries.Mumbai Indians are now gearing up for a crucial encounter against Rajasthan Royals in Jaipur on Thursday.","Mumbai Indians batter Suryakumar Yadav opened up about his debut season with the franchise in 2011.

He recorded 4 rebounds, 7 assists, and kept his turnovers low with just 2. While he didn‚Äôt register any steals or blocks, his offensive output more than made up for it.

Poll What do you think was the key factor in Mumbai Indians' victory over Rajasthan Royals? Tactics of the captains Bowling excellence from MI Rajasthan's poor performance Strong batting performance

On Maharashtra Day (May 1), Mumbai Indians gave their fans a lot to celebrate with a thumping 100-run victory against Rajasthan Royals and jumped to the top of the IPL points table on Thursday.Teen sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi and Rajasthan Royals flattered to deceive after a dream performance just three days before against Gujarat Titans at the same venue. RR are the second team after Chennai Super Kings to crash out of the competition.Everyone was eager to see how Suryavanshi would bat against the power-packed MI pace lineup following his spectacular 101 off 38 balls in the previous encounter. However, the 14-year-old lasted just two balls, offering a straight catch to mid-on fielder Will Jacks in Deepak Chahar‚Äôs first over.The sixth successive win by the Hardik Pandya-led MI has more or less sealed their berth for the playoffs. MI, incidentally, posted their first win here since 2012.On Monday, RR successfully chased a 210-run target with ease thanks to Suryavanshi‚Äôs heroics, but they found the 218-run target too hot to handle and were bundled out for a mere 117 in 16.1 overs. Only four RR batsmen ‚Äî Jofra Archer (30), Riyan Parag (16), Yashasvi Jaiswal (13) and Dhruv Jurel (11) ‚Äî managed to reach double-digit figures, marking their worst batting show of the season.Leg-spinner Karn Sharma and Trent Boult triggered RR‚Äôs collapse and ended with three scalps each. In-form opener Yashasvi Jaiswal also did not last long and neither did other top-order batters. By the time the Powerplay ended, RR were out of the game.Earlier, Rohit Sharma presented himself with a perfect birthday gift a day after turning 38 with a brilliant half-century to guide MI to 217/2. Rohit (53; 36b, 9x4) and Ryan Rickelton (61; 38b, 7x4, 3x6) laid a solid foundation with a first-wicket partnership of 116 runs.Skipper Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav then capitalised on the flying start by hitting an unbeaten 48 runs each to take the score beyond the 200-run mark. Pandya and Suryakumar took the aerial route to perfection to give the innings a grand finish. Both faced an identical 23 balls and ended up with the same strike rate of 208.69.Some of RR captain Riyan Parag‚Äôs tactics were also surprising.

'It‚Äôs a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee ‚Äî Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match ‚Äî before the Nagpur ODI ‚Äî more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‚ÄòHitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

A night meant for baseball glory turned tragic when Kavan Markwood , a 20-year-old former college football player, fell 21 feet from the stands at PNC Park during the Pirates vs. Cubs game on Wednesday. The terrifying moment, caught on video, has gone viral across social media platforms, drawing concern and sympathy from fans nationwide.The incident unfolded just as Andrew McCutchen delivered a clutch two-run double in the bottom of the seventh inning, giving the Pittsburgh Pirates a 4‚Äì3 lead. As cheers erupted, cameras and spectators captured the moment Markwood tumbled from above the iconic Clemente Wall, landing on the warning track in right field.The game was paused for about 10 minutes while EMS, police, and on-field staff rushed to assist. Markwood was quickly transported to Allegheny General Hospital, where he remains in critical condition. Officials have said the fall is being treated as accidental.The viral video has since stunned sports fans and raised questions about stadium safety. While authorities have not released the footage officially, clips circulating online show the immediate shock in the stadium as the crowd realized what had happened.Later identified by the South Allegheny School District, Markwood is a McKeesport native and a former linebacker for Wheeling University.

What‚Äôs the tile game Meghan Markle played on Netflix? A beginner‚Äôs guide to mahjong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/whats-the-tile-game-meghan-markle-played-on-netflix-a-beginners-guide-to-mahjong/articleshow/120736644.cms,"Meghan Markle played the game of Mahjong in her Netflix series

From the Qing dynasty to pop culture

How is mahjong played?

Connor Wan, a 29-year-old British-Chinese artist, learned mahjong while visiting family in Hong Kong. He enjoyed it so much that he started the Four Winds Mahjong Club in London, and later brought it to Toronto after moving there in 2024. ‚ÄúMoving countries is hard, especially when you don‚Äôt know anyone,‚Äù he said. The club became popular quickly, not as a place for gambling, but for making friends and celebrating Asian culture. Nicole Wong, a writer and audio producer from California, started playing mahjong as a teenager with her grandparents. She later began The Mahjong Project in 2019 to share the game‚Äôs cultural stories and organise pop-up game nights. This year, she published a book called Mahjong: House Rules from Across the Asian Diaspora. Nicole says the sound of the tiles is especially powerful. ‚ÄúMahjong is more than just fun,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt has a deep history and brings back strong memories.‚Äù In Toronto, Robyn Feldberg has taught over 250 people how to play mahjong through her courses. She donates all the money‚Äîabout $50,000 so far‚Äîto charities like Save A Child‚Äôs Heart. She says the game is especially popular with young mothers who want a fun way to relax and connect with others. ‚ÄúThey tell me, ‚ÄòWe want something that‚Äôs just for us,‚Äô‚Äù she said.

A centuries-old Chinese game called mahjong is having a modern revival across continents, from luxury cruise ships and trendy hotel lounges to Meghan Markle‚Äôs Netflix series.In the sixth episode of her docuseries With Love, the Duchess of Sussex invites friends for a cosy game night ‚Äì playing mahjong, reports the Globe and Mail.The four-person tile-based game, traditionally associated with Chinese culture, is now catching on with new generations across the globe. ‚ÄúThe game itself is really so fun,‚Äù says Markle. ‚ÄúBut what was so great was the idea of learning something new with your friends, together... the mahjong becomes the background of the expansion of friendship. It‚Äôs the feeling of community.‚ÄùMahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China. Traditionally played with 144 tiles, the game blends skill, strategy and a touch of luck. Players pick and discard tiles to form winning hands, much like the card game rummy.The game‚Äôs expansion across the world has now erupted into a full-blown trend. The World Mahjong Championship was recently held in Mississauga, Ontario ‚Äì the first time it‚Äôs been hosted in North America. Hotels such as the Ace Hotel New York and Thompson Hotel Dallas regularly hold mahjong-themed nights.Fans with money to spare are buying fancy mahjong sets from Herm√®s, Louis Vuitton, and Ralph Lauren. Some are even splashing out on luxury tables that shuffle the tiles automatically ‚Äì costing over $4,500.Even cruise ships have joined the trend, offering mahjong tournaments and special rooms just for playing the game.Mahjong is played with 144 tiles. Players begin by shuffling the tiles face down. Everyone rolls dice and the highest roller becomes the dealer. Each player picks 36 tiles and builds a wall‚Äîtwo rows of 18 tiles. The walls are pushed forward, creating a space in the middle for discards. Each player then draws 13 tiles (the dealer starts with 14), and the game begins.Players take turns drawing one tile and discarding one, always keeping 13 tiles in hand. You can draw a new tile or pick up someone‚Äôs discarded one. If a discarded tile helps complete a set (called a meld), you can grab it, announce the set, and show the tiles. To win, a player must have four melds (like three or four matching tiles or a sequence of three in a suit) and one pair (two matching tiles)‚Äîmaking 14 tiles total.There are five types of tiles: Bamboo, Characters, Dots (these are the three main suits), and special tiles called Honors (Dragons and Winds) and Bonus (Flowers and Seasons). Each suit goes from 1 to 9. Honors and Bonus tiles add extra excitement but aren't needed to win. Mahjong mixes strategy and memory with a bit of luck‚Äîand it‚Äôs all about building the right sets before your opponents do.For many mahjong fans, it‚Äôs not just a game but a deeply social experience.","Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China.

As the world mourns the passing of Pope Francis , a TikToker has found a viral way to keep younger audiences engaged in the otherwise secretive process of choosing the next Pope by turning it into a fantasy league, reports The Washington Times.The papal conclave , set to begin on May 7 at the Vatican, will see cardinals from across the globe gather behind closed doors to vote for the next head of the Catholic Church . While the centuries-old process is steeped in tradition, one content creator on TikTok is bringing a modern twist to it.The Tik Toker named Max, going by the username of @itismaxhooray has launched what he calls the Pope League , a fantasy football-style game where users pick a cardinal and earn points based on how their pick performs in the voting rounds.‚ÄúThere are 10 times the number of people in this sweepstakes as there are cardinals in the Catholic Church, making it bigger and therefore more legitimate than the real conclave,‚Äù Max was quoted as saying by the Independent.The idea quickly went viral. The Washington Times reported that over 2,000 people signed up for the game on the very first day, after Max‚Äôs videos were viewed more than 100,000 times. Participants can earn ""Pope points"" and even imagine themselves ‚Äúbecoming the next Pope‚Äù through the game.The real conclave is expected to be closely watched, especially since most of the cardinals voting were appointed by Pope Francis himself. This has raised questions about whether the next Pontiff will continue the current path of reform or shift to a more moderate direction.Pope Francis died on April 21 at the age of 88 in Vatican City. His funeral was attended by world leaders, dignitaries, and thousands of mourners from around the globe.","The papal conclave, set to begin on May 7 at the Vatican, will see cardinals from across the globe gather behind closed doors to vote for the next head of the Catholic Church.

A Father's Pride: How RR, Dravid & Vikram Shaped Vaibhav Suryavanshi

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians continued their red-hot form in IPL 2025 with a commanding 100-run win over Rajasthan Royals at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on Thursday.Central to MI's sixth straight win were opener Ryan Rickelton ‚Äôs authoritative 61 and Karn Sharma ‚Äôs clinical bowling performance, which helped dismantle RR‚Äôs fragile batting lineup.Sent to bat first, MI openers Rohit Sharma and Ryan Rickelton laid a powerful foundation. Rickelton, in particular, was relentless against the Rajasthan pacers, unleashing his full range of strokes.His 38-ball 61 was a display of fearless cricket, highlighted by a majestic flick off Fazalhaq Farooqi that soared over the ropes.He was especially effective against the quicker bowlers, handling express pace with composure and punishing any width offered.With the scoreboard ticking freely, MI posted 58/0 in the powerplay, and Rickelton reached his half-century in style with a towering six off a half-tracker from Kartikeya.While Rickelton and Rohit stitched a 116-run stand, it was the bowling unit that backed up the batters superbly -- particularly veteran leg-spinner Karn Sharma, who turned the game firmly in MI's favour after coming in as an impact substitute during the chase.With Royals reeling from the early loss of teenager Vaibhav Suryavanshi and Yashasvi Jaiswal, Karn struck thrice, removing Dhruv Jurel, Maheesh Theekshana and Kumar Kartikeya to notch up a figure of 3/23 with an economy of 5.80.His disciplined lines and clever variations choked the middle order and exposing RR‚Äôs lack of depth.With Trent Boult, Jasprit Bumrah and Deepak Chahar providing pace and bounce up front, Karn‚Äôs control in the middle overs ensured that RR never recovered.Rajasthan folded for just 117 in 16.1 overs, unable to cope with the scoreboard pressure or MI's all-round execution.With this comprehensive win, Mumbai Indians not only ended Rajasthan's playoff chances but also sent a strong message to the rest of the league: they‚Äôre peaking at the perfect time.",Mumbai Indians beat Rajasthan Royals by 100 runs in IPL 2025. Ryan Rickelton top scored for MI with 61 from 38 balls. Karn Sharma took three wickets for 3/23 with an economy of 5.80.
