Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

Poll Do you think Rohit Sharma should continue playing ODIs after his T20 retirement? No, it's time to retire. Yes, he should.

India's probable Test squad for England Tour

NEW DELHI: India’s white-ball captain Rohit Sharma has finally addressed questions surrounding his future in One Day Internationals (ODIs). In a candid conversation with senior journalist Vimal Kumar, Rohit made it clear that while he’s not done just yet, he’s very aware of when to walk away.The veteran opener emphasised his evolved approach to batting, saying, ""I used to play the way I used to, I took my time. Earlier, I would play 30 balls in the first 10 overs and be at just 10 runs. But if I play 20 balls now, why can't I score 30, 35, or even 40 runs? And on the days when I get going, hitting the accelerator, scoring 80 runs in the first 10 overs isn't bad at all. That's how I think now.""READ ALSO: 'Bekaar': Rohit Sharma makes shocking statement about naturally-gifted player ""I’ve done it; I’ve scored the runs I was meant to. Now, I want to play cricket in a different way. I’m not taking any of this for granted. Don’t assume that things will just keep going the same way, that I’ll keep scoring 20 or 30 runs and just continue playing. The day I feel like I’m not able to do what I want to do on the field, I’ll stop playing. That’s for sure. But right now, I know that what I’m doing is still helping the team,"" he added.READ ALSO: Rohit Sharma hits back at criticism: 'Defending myself is waste of time' Rohit has been a key pillar in India's ODI setup, with 11,168 runs in 273 matches at an impressive average of 48.76. Under his leadership, India clinched the T20 World Cup in 2024 and the Champions Trophy earlier this year, further cementing his legacy in white-ball cricket.While he called time on his T20 career after the Barbados final, the 37-year-old recently stepped away from Test cricket after an 11-year career, having played 67 Tests and scored 4,301 runs. His highest Test score, 212, came during a memorable series against South Africa in 2019.While he’s shut the door on red-ball cricket, just like his compatriot Virat Kohli, who hung his Test boots on Monday in an unexpected retirement call, both Kohli and Rohit remain committed to ODIs, for now. Perhaps the pair is keeping an eye on the upcoming 2027 ODI World Cup.Rohit’s message is clear: he’s still hungry, still driven, but when the moment comes to step aside, he’ll do it on his own terms.","India's white-ball captain Rohit Sharma has addressed questions surrounding his future in One Day Internationals.

'Clear-cut Indian victory... IAF hit entrances of Pak N-weapons site',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/clear-cut-indian-victory-iaf-hit-entrances-of-pak-n-weapons-site/articleshow/121147531.cms,"Austrian aerial warfare analyst and military historian Tom Cooper tells Times Now’s Navika Kumar in an interview on the impact on Pak of India’s Op Sindoor that the videos are evidence that India has struck and destroyed the entrances to nuclear sites in Pakistan. Excerpts:

We've been following you here in India, and you virtually declared that India had a clear-cut victory in the skies. Could you elaborate... why you think India had an advantage, and where did Pakistan fail?

India has so far given no confirmation on striking any nuclear storage sites. In fact, at a press conference by the defence forces, they even jokingly said they didn't know where these existed.

Do you believe the radioactivity reports that have surfaced today?

It's relatively simple in military terms ... Pakistan attempted to hit back at India with UAVs, with artillery missiles, even with ballistic missiles... this effort failed because Indian air defences shot down the mass of incoming weaponry. On the other hand we have seen early on May 10 the IAF striking not only PAF bases but also the entrance, both entrances, to the Pakistan nuclear weapons storage site at Mushaf air base... And the fact is, in the way the military understands warfare, when you start targeting enemy nuclear weapon storage sites, it means you are absolutely sure the enemy cannot hit back... And from this point of view, it's a clear-cut victory for India.There is a video clearly showing hits on entrances, on both entrances of the nuclear storage site, which means it has been geo-confirmed... of course, Pakistanis, a few I have spoken to, they have said, 'No.' But I have a strong feeling ... that India is not shooting missiles wildly around the place where their (Pakistani) nuclear weapons are stored. So, the overall conclusion is that New Delhi does not want to further escalate. And once you keep in mind, Indian generals in particular ... they are stolidly conservative ... they wouldn't let anybody randomly shoot missiles in that direction. This is a clear message. We can hit you where it hurts. The conclusion is unavoidable. Pakistan cannot protect its own nuclear weapon storage sites, cannot even protect its air bases. Therefore, India is in a position of clear advantage...I haven't studied them closely yet... But the point is this: whatever the radioactivity explains, the fact is that the nuclear storage site has been hit, not directly the storage site, but the entrance into the underground complex. It means that most likely the entrance and exit to this storage site have been cut off ... If the Pakistanis cannot enter the storage site, if they cannot reach their nuclear weapons ... it's game over.","Austrian aerial warfare analyst and military historian Tom Cooper tells Times Now’s Navika Kumar that the videos are evidence that India has struck and destroyed the entrances to nuclear sites in Pakistan.

What’s Next for Golden State?

Theface an uncertain future after a challenging playoff run. Stephen Curry is nearing the end of his of his illustrious career and so is Draymond Green. Even though they acquired Jimmy Butler earlier this year, their path to the Western Conference could look bleak given the injuries that these players succumb to. Could a blockbuster move for a Lakers superstar change their fortunes next season?(Disclaimer: The data and analysis in this post are based on conjecture as of right now.Although the information is based on reliable sources, it's crucial to remember that these are not official declarations or verified actions. It is advised that readers use caution when interpreting this analysis and wait for official updates as the offseason progresses.) Sports Illustrated’s Alex Kirschenbaum recently suggested that the Golden State Warriors might pursue Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James this offseason. James, a four-time NBA champion, could provide Golden State with much-needed frontcourt size and experience.Kirschenbaum noted: ""(LeBron) James has long been linked to Golden State, in part because his rivalry against Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Draymond Green (they've played each other in five playoff series, during which James has gone 2-3) eventually blossomed into a bromance.""However, age and injury concerns loom large. A potential lineup featuring James (39), Curry (37), Jimmy Butler (35), and Draymond Green (34) would raise questions about durability.According to Caleb Hightower of the Sporting News 1. Championship Pedigree: James brings unmatched playoff experience and leadership.2. Fit with Curry: Their contrasting skill sets could create an unstoppable offensive duo.3. Lakers’ Struggles: With L.A. failing to advance past the first round, James may seek a new challenge.- Injury Risks: James, Curry, and Butler all dealt with significant injuries this postseason.- Contract Hurdles: James holds a $52.6 million player option, complicating any trade or signing.- Lakers’ Plans: His commitment to playing alongside Luka Dončić could keep him in Los Angeles.If the Warriors exit the playoffs early and seek a roster shakeup, James could emerge as a high-risk, high-reward target. While his arrival would electrify the Bay Area, logistical and financial challenges make this move far from guaranteed.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to sign $197,230,450 Memphis Grizzlies star to bolster squad around LeBron James and Luka Doncic For now, fans can only speculate—but the idea of LeBron in a Warriors jersey remains a fascinating possibility.","The Golden State Warriors face an uncertain future after a challenging playoff run.

(Did Maxwell not play well for the team because he didn't marry you?).""Zinta responded firmly, calling out the blatant sexism: ""Will you ask this question to the male team owners of all teams, or is this discrimination just towards the women?"" she wrote.She added, ""I never knew how difficult it is for women to survive in corporate setups until I got into cricket. I’m sure you asked this question out of humour, but I hope you can actually look at your question and understand what you are trying to say because if you really understand what you’re trying to say, it’s not pretty!

Aaron Ekblad’s skillset and playoff experience could make him a game-changer for Edmonton

As the Edmonton Oilers push toward the Western Conference Final with a commanding 3-1 lead over the Vegas Golden Knights, the focus remains on the current playoff run. But behind the scenes, the front office is reportedly preparing for a pivotal offseason—and a blockbuster move may be on the horizon.According to Bleacher Report’s Lyle Richardson, the Oilers have been floated as a potential landing spot for Florida Panthers star defenseman Aaron Ekblad in free agency. The veteran blue-liner, who carries an estimated market value of around $60 million, could significantly bolster Edmonton’s defensive corps if a deal materializes.Ekblad is no stranger to high-stakes hockey. A cornerstone of the Florida Panthers’ blue line, he has proven himself as a reliable two-way defenseman over the years. During the regular season, he recorded 3 goals and 30 assists in 56 games. His presence has continued to be felt in the playoffs, where he’s already contributed 1 goal and 3 assists in just five games.More than just his stats, Ekblad’s ability to adapt to different defensive pairings and maintain effectiveness under pressure is what makes him an ideal fit for a team like Edmonton.“The Oilers saw Ekblad’s talent first hand in last season’s Stanley Cup Final . Scherber makes the case that his effectiveness, ability to adapt to different defense partners, and overall skills would be a terrific fit on Edmonton’s blue line. He’d also have a chance to play with superstars Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl ,” Richardson wrote.The Oilers have long been known for their offensive firepower, headlined by the likes of McDavid and Draisaitl. But balancing their attack with defensive consistency has been a challenge. Adding a veteran like Ekblad could provide much-needed stability on the back end, giving Edmonton a more well-rounded roster moving forward.Also Read: Matthew Tkachuk health update: Panthers’ Right Wing puts injury rumors to rest with strong Game 3 performance While any potential move is still speculative, the idea of bringing in a top-tier defenseman like Ekblad shows that the Oilers are thinking big.

Max Verstappen: “Better to watch him fight back”: F1 legend Mario Andretti thinks Max Verstappen is better off without a dominant Red Bull car,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/formula-one/news/better-to-watch-him-fight-back-f1-legend-mario-andretti-thinks-max-verstappen-is-better-off-without-a-dominant-red-bull-car/articleshow/121110142.cms,"Mario Andretti (via Getty Images)



Mario Andretti feels Red Bull's design issues are bringing out Verstappen's unpolished talent



Adrian Newey's departure creates a visible gap at Red Bull, claims Mario Andretti



Motor sport icon Mario Andretti has provided a new perspective on Max Verstappen 's Formula 1 campaign in 2025, claiming the Red Bull Racing driver doesn't need the quickest car to be at his best—and that fans are actually served better when he isn't. The 1978 Formula 1 World Champion explained to GPblog why Max Verstappen's present status as an underdog relative to McLaren benefits the sport and why Adrian Newey 's resignation could be at the core of Red Bull's problems.As the 2025 F1 season approaches its European swing, Max Verstappen is on the back foot. McLaren's Oscar Piastri has stormed ahead with three consecutive wins, but Verstappen is still in the title race without the advantage of the dominant car he's had in recent years. For Mario Andretti, that's not a drawback—it's entertainment. “You can tell that he does not have more of a clear advantage,” Mario Andretti said. “He doesn't need an advantage, by the way. He's good enough. For us watching, it's best if he doesn't, because he fights. Watch him; it's really better to watch him fight back than to 'oh, he's gone. Nobody can touch him.”Mario Andretti believes that when Max Verstappen is pushed, it brings out a different kind of driving from him—more grit, more drama, and more thrill for the fans. The consistency of the Dutch driver in putting up good shows despite Red Bull's recent inconsistency has been a major theme of the 2025 season.Although Red Bull Racing has brushed aside rumours of a structural crisis, Mario Andretti is of the opinion that the loss of long-time technical director Adrian Newey has taken a definite toll on the performance of the team. Newey, who left to join Aston Martin, was the pillar of Red Bull's car development achievement for almost two decades.“I don't know if it's a coincidence or what, but ever since Adrian Newey left the team, something seemed like something was missing,” he stated. “I know Adrian very well. He's the best engineer I've ever worked with. I suppose so. He was in IndyCar with me in ’87, so I know his value, and he has a record to show for what he's done with every team he's been with. So again, it is what it is. Just the events and whatever happened. We all know. But from where I sit, I think that's part of the issue. If they were to express themselves openly, they would say the same thing; especially Jos is the other, I think. But then again, it's not my business.”Also read: Colton Herta Leads Cadillac's F1 Driver List: Mario Andretti Assures Max Verstappen can no longer be alone in a league of his own with Red Bull's equipment in 2025, but in the eyes of Mario Andretti, that's what makes the season more interesting.

What’s going on with Travis Kelce? Mysterious offseason shift alarms NFL fans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/whats-going-on-with-travis-kelce-mysterious-offseason-shift-alarms-nfl-fans/articleshow/121138949.cms,"Travis Kelce is reportedly undergoing a significant physical transformation (Getty Images)

Leaner and faster: Travis Kelce’s offseason transformation could be a game-changer

Travis Kelce isn’t just preparing for another season—he’s potentially gearing up for his last, and he’s doing it with a major physical transformation. The Kansas City Chiefs star tight end has reportedly dropped over 20 pounds this offseason, signaling a level of intensity and focus that suggests he’s all-in on making 2025 a season to remember.NFL insider Dov Kleiman reported the weight loss via X (formerly Twitter), highlighting that Kelce is more committed than ever to being in peak shape. At 34, Kelce has nothing left to prove—three Super Bowl rings, countless Pro Bowl appearances, and a reputation as one of the greatest tight ends in NFL history. But for the future Hall of Famer, there’s one more mountain he wants to climb.Shedding 20+ pounds isn’t just a cosmetic choice. Kelce has built his career on precision route-running, agility, and the ability to create separation even against elite defenders. Losing weight may not only enhance his speed but could also reduce the physical toll on his joints after more than a decade in one of the league’s most physically demanding positions.The move comes after a season that, while ending in a Super Bowl victory, showed glimpses of wear and tear on Kelce. Paired with the spotlight of his high-profile relationship with Taylor Swift, many questioned whether he’d hang up his cleats. But instead of retreating from the game, Kelce has doubled down.""I'm coming back for sure. Gonna try to get into the best shape I've been this offseason and get back to the mountaintop,"" Kelce wrote to ESPN’s Pat McAfee earlier this year. ""Got a real bad taste in my mouth with how I played in that last game and with how I got the guys ready for battle. I can't go out like that!!!!""Also Read: Taylor Swift’s quiet return with Travis Kelce hints at something big—are the daisies a clue for her next music release? That kind of fire has sparked serious buzz around the league. With rumors swirling that 2025 could be his final season, Kelce’s renewed focus and physical overhaul could make him even more dangerous. If this is indeed his farewell tour, he’s not just aiming to play—he’s aiming to dominate.And history has shown, when Travis Kelce is locked in, greatness usually follows.","Travis Kelce has reportedly dropped over 20 pounds this offseason.

Baltimore Ravens face major kicking shakeup as John Hoyland joins Tyler Loop in post Justin Tucker era to fill the void,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/baltimore-ravens-face-major-kicking-shakeup-as-john-hoyland-joins-tyler-loop-in-post-justin-tucker-era-to-fill-the-void/articleshow/121139074.cms,"Rookies John Hoyland and Tyler Loop are now competing to fill Justin Tucker's shoes (Image via AP)

Hoyland and Loop: two rookies, one shot at replacing a legend

In a stunning shift that few saw coming, the Baltimore Ravens are entering a new era without the leg of Justin Tucker—one of the most iconic and reliable kickers in NFL history. The team released Tucker on May 5, marking the end of a 14-year tenure during which he became the league’s most accurate kicker with an 89.1% success rate. Now, Baltimore is turning to fresh faces and open competition to find their next special teams cornerstone.Baltimore Ravens signed former Wyoming standout John Hoyland on Monday following a strong showing at a recent tryout. He’ll now go head-to-head with rookie Tyler Loop , a sixth-round pick out of Arizona, in what promises to be one of the most closely watched position battles of Ravens training camp.Hoyland brings a strong collegiate résumé, especially in short-range consistency—missing only twice in 54 career kicks from under 40 yards. His long-range game is still developing, with most of his misses coming from beyond 50 yards. But his calm under pressure and work ethic made him an attractive candidate for the Ravens, who may be seeking the next undrafted success story—much like Tucker himself once was.Loop, on the other hand, enters the competition as the first kicker the Ravens have ever drafted. He made 6 of 9 field goals from 50-plus yards at Arizona, including a booming 62-yarder that showcased his leg strength.Both kickers had strong showings in rookie minicamp, earning praise from head coach John Harbaugh. “Both kickers, I thought, looked really good today. So, we got them out there behind the line with the snap and everything, and I think they made them all, didn’t they? So that’s good to see. It’s a good start that way.”Tucker’s release wasn’t just about age or performance. The move came amid an ongoing NFL investigation involving 16 massage therapists accusing him of inappropriate behavior, as reported by the Baltimore Banner. The Ravens called it a “football decision,” but the timing raises questions about the franchise's internal calculus.Also Read: Who is Rich Eisen?

Shedeur Sanders draws inspiration from Tom Brady after draft slide

From Day 3 pick to potential starter: Sanders begins NFL journey with quiet confidence

Shedeur Sanders entered the 2025 NFL Draft with high expectations. Once considered a potential first-round pick, the former Colorado standout instead endured a surprising drop to the fifth round. But rather than dwelling on the disappointment, Sanders is embracing the challenge—and he’s using inspiration from one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time to fuel his fire.After being selected by the Cleveland Browns, Sheduer Sanders revealed he had a conversation with seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady. The message he took away from it could define his approach to the NFL.""That my story is going to be similar,"" Sanders told reporters. ""I was a late-round draft pick, but we’re here now, so none of that stuff matters. That just mattered on the day, and I’m just excited to be here and ready to work.""Falling to Day 3 in the draft can be discouraging, especially for a player as high-profile as Sanders. But the Browns quarterback is already showing maturity beyond his years. With eyes set on proving himself in Cleveland, Sanders is determined to rewrite the narrative around his draft position.According to Cleveland.com’s Mary Kay Cabot, Sanders “performed well on the field” during rookie minicamp, demonstrating “good arm strength” and “sound decision-making.” Those early signs are encouraging for a player looking to compete for the starting job as early as this season.Sanders' pedigree isn’t in question—he’s the son of Hall of Famer Deion Sanders and showcased leadership, accuracy, and poise during his college career. Now, the real test begins at the professional level, where pressure, competition, and scrutiny are magnified.Tom Brady’s rise from 199th overall pick to GOAT status is one of the NFL’s most legendary stories. Sanders knows that kind of arc takes time, resilience, and relentless effort. But the belief in himself is clear, and the foundation is set.Also Read: Tom Brady raises eyebrows after including exes Gisele Bündchen and Bridget Moynahan in Mother’s Day post Whether Sanders ultimately carves out a Brady-like legacy or not, one thing is certain: he’s not shying away from the moment.

A Christmas Day clash with serious playoff implications



As the NFL continues its tradition of high-stakes Christmas Day football, this year’s festive matchup promises both on-field intensity and off-field star power. The Kansas City Chiefs are slated to face the Denver Broncos on December 25, and it’s already shaping up to be more than just a game — it’s becoming a celebrity-infused holiday event.Travis Kelce and global pop icon Taylor Swift are reportedly planning to celebrate Christmas together again this year — this time alongside Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany. The couple will be spending the holiday in Kansas City before the Chiefs hit the field at 5:15 p.m. PT / 8:15 p.m. ET for their primetime matchup against the Broncos.Swift's growing presence in Kelce’s life has become a staple in both NFL and entertainment news, and her deepening connection to the Chiefs community adds another layer of interest to this year’s holiday game. This festive gathering with the Mahomes family could symbolize her further integration into Kelce’s world — and by extension, the heart of Chiefs Kingdom.Beyond the celebrity headlines, the game itself carries major implications. The Chiefs are aiming to reclaim their Super Bowl crown after a devastating 40-22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in February — a blow that ended their hopes for a historic three-peat. Kansas City enters the 2025 season having won the AFC West for nine straight years, but they’ll need every win to stay ahead in a more competitive division.The Denver Broncos, meanwhile, are riding high after breaking a nearly decade-long playoff drought last season, helped in part by a split series against the Chiefs. With rookie quarterback Bo Nix continuing to impress, Denver could pose a real threat to Kansas City’s postseason ambitions.This year’s Christmas matchup will be exclusively broadcast on Prime Video, part of the league’s expanding media strategy after its successful partnership with Netflix last year. The 2024 holiday games drew over 65 million viewers, and the Chiefs’ win over the Steelers was especially memorable — featuring Kelce’s record-setting touchdown catch that surpassed franchise legend Tony Gonzalez.Also Read: Travis Kelce drops 25 pounds under Taylor Swift’s influence—helpful push or harmful pressure?

Browns take a chance on controversial QB Shedeur Sanders



“I’m here to work and win.”

Shedeur Sanders has a point to prove



The NFL draft had barely settled when Cleveland made a move that stunned nearly everyone—drafting Shedeur Sanders. Ignored by other teams and dismissed by critics, Sanders now steps into a franchise built on heartbreak and hunger. But make no mistake, this wasn’t just a draft pick. It was a warning. “I’m here to work and win,” he declared, not as a promise, but as a battle cry. And with that, Shedeur Sanders lit a fuse in Cleveland.Shedeur wasn’t supposed to land in Cleveland. At least, not according to the so-called experts. Teams backed off, scouts doubted, and whispers of distraction clouded his name. But the Browns saw something different—an edge, a spark, maybe even the guts to lead a locker room that’s been gasping for a quarterback with swagger and substance.While others questioned his discipline, his focus, or his celebrity status, Sanders is keeping his vision sharp. “I feel like the Browns fans they just want something to hope for and they’ve been wanting it so long and long,” he said. “And finally, I’m here to change that, I’m here to actually get what they want.” That isn’t just confidence. That’s defiance.Cleveland isn’t an easy market. The weight of broken seasons, endless quarterback rotations, and dashed playoff hopes isn’t lost on Sanders. But he’s not shying away. He’s owning it.“On the field, of course, that’s where I want my personality,” Sanders said. “That's what I want to be known for, is the one that came here and changed the franchise.”The most dangerous athletes in sports are the ones with something to prove. Sanders watched as team after team passed on him. Now, with a chip on his shoulder and a city behind him, he’s poised to flip the script.Also Read: 2025 NFL Schedule unveiled: Eagles vs. Cowboys, Global matchups and key games you can't miss And whether he starts Week 1 or not, he’s not just trying to make the roster.

What to expect from Cleveland Cavaliers vs Indiana Pacers Game 5 (May 13, 2025)

Theare fighting to stay alive in the playoffs as they host the Indiana Pacers in a do-or-die Game 5. The biggest question looming over the game is whether star guardwill play after suffering an ankle injury in Game 4. Donovan Mitchell’s availability remains up in the air after he exited Game 4 early due to a flare-up of his ankle injury. Despite attempting to play through it, he was ruled out for the second half, leaving the Cleveland Cavaliers without their leading scorer in a pivotal loss.Key updates on Mitchell’s status:- An MRI confirmed the ankle injury is a recurring issue.- NBA insider Shams Charania reported Mitchell will be a game-time decision.- The Cavaliers have not provided a definitive update, leaving his status uncertain until tipoff.If Mitchell can’t suit up, Cleveland faces a steep challenge. He has been the team’s primary offensive weapon, especially with other key players already sidelined.Here’s how the Cavaliers’ performance stacks up with and without Mitchell in this series:Without Mitchell, the Cavaliers lack a reliable closer, and their offense becomes more predictable. The Pacers, already leading the series 3-1, would have a clear path to closing it out.Even at less than 100%, Donovan Mitchell has shown he can take over games. His ability to create shots and draw defensive attention opens up opportunities for teammates. If he plays, the Cleveland Cavaliers have a fighting chance to extend the series.Factors working in Mitchell’s favor:- Playoff experience in high-pressure games.- A history of playing through injuries.- The urgency of an elimination game.However, if he’s limited, the Pacers’ defense—led by pesky perimeter defenders—could exploit his lack of mobility.Game 5 tips off tonight at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, and all eyes will be on Mitchell’s status. If he plays, the Cleveland Cavaliers could regain momentum. If not, their season may be on the brink.For now, fans will have to wait until game time for the final word on whether Cleveland’s star will take the floor in this must-win showdown.","The Cleveland Cavaliers host the Indiana Pacers in a do-or-die Game 5.

Post-match, Haliburton shared how the Pacers clinched the huge win to secure the back-to-back playoff final spot.Tyrese Haliburton stole the show on Tuesday as his team, the Indiana Pacers, made history after clinching a spot in the playoff finals while keeping the championship dream alive. After the 114-105 Game 5 win, Haliburton says that many people had no confidence in the team, but the Pacers teammates stayed true to their game plans and silenced the doubters and critics in a most fulfilling way.""We had a lot of confidence in what we did last year, even though a lot of people didn't,"" Haliburton said after the game.He added that basketball is like a game of chess, although he never played, but his tactics and support from his teammates did wonder in the series as they had a 4-1 lead.Haliburton led the Pacers in Game 5 with 31 points in 36 minutes, shooting an impressive 10-for-15 from the floor and sinking six of his ten shots from deep.

(Getty Images)

Tom Brady’s impact on the draft raises questions, while Shedeur Sanders’ exclusion sparks debate

The 2025 NFL Draft stirred plenty of discussion not just for who was selected, but for who wasn’t. At the heart of the conversation were Tom Brady , Shedeur Sanders , and the Las Vegas Raiders , with quarterbacks like Geno Smith and analysts like Chris Trapasso adding new layers to the story.Tom Brady, now a minority owner of the Raiders, found himself under scrutiny after the team chose not to draft Shedeur Sanders. Although Brady had previously spoken positively about Sanders and reportedly mentored him, the Raiders selected Cam Miller in the sixth round instead.This decision sparked criticism, with sports personality Skip Bayless accusing Brady of being a ""two-faced hypocrite,"" suggesting he played a part in Shedeur’s fall down the draft board. Brady denied influencing the draft process, stating that those decisions rest with the front office and coaching staff, not ownership.Shedeur Sanders, once a projected first-rounder, experienced a surprising slide to the fifth round, where he was picked up by the Cleveland Browns. Many insiders pointed to concerns over his interviews and perceived arrogance during pre-draft evaluations.However, Sanders embraced the situation, drawing comparisons to Tom Brady’s own underdog story. He’s already turning heads at Browns rookie minicamp, reportedly outperforming fellow QB Dillon Gabriel.Chris Trapasso, CBS Sports NFL Draft analyst, was vocal throughout the pre-draft process and afterward, particularly about Sanders’ draft stock.""Allar has kinks to work out of his game-better decision-making and slightly better accuracy. The traits are through the roof at 6-foot-5 and close to 240 pounds. Geno Smith is a fine short-term option for the Raiders.”“ Allar represents significant upside for the future, and I could envision Tom Brady gravitating toward a pocket-passer type,"" Chris Trapasso wrote.Meanwhile, Geno Smith’s presence as a veteran starter remains relevant in this context. Smith, once considered a draft disappointment, has revitalized his career and become an example of perseverance.His story resonates with younger quarterbacks like Sanders, showing that a rough start doesn’t mean a doomed career. Smith has spoken in support of young quarterbacks being given time to mature rather than being judged too quickly.Also read: Raiders sign WR Dont’e Thornton as Geno Smith takes charge under Tom Brady’s watchful eye Together, these narratives reflect the changing NFL mindset where draft position doesn’t guarantee success or failure. Whether it’s Tom Brady brushing off media heat, Chris Trapasso offering sharp analysis, or Shedeur Sanders embracing his journey, one message stands out: the path to NFL success isn’t straight, and it’s far from over after draft weekend.","The 2025 NFL Draft stirred plenty of discussion not just for who was selected, but for who wasn't.

When will reinstalled players be eligible for Hall of Fame consideration? Chairperson Jane Forbes Clark responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/when-will-reinstalled-players-be-eligible-for-hall-of-fame-consideration-chairperson-jane-forbes-clark-responds/articleshow/121151452.cms,"When will reinstalled players be eligible for Hall of Fame consideration? Chairperson Jane Forbes Clark responds (Image Source: Getty)

Jane Forbes Clark explains how the board will decide now

“The National Baseball Hall of Fame has always maintained that anyone removed from baseball’s permanently ineligible list will become eligible for Hall of Fame consideration. Major League Baseball’s decision to remove deceased individuals from the permanently ineligible list will allow for the Hall of Fame candidacy of such individuals to now be considered. The Historical Overview Committee will develop the ballot of eight names for the Classic Baseball Era Committee—which evaluates candidates who made their greatest impact on the game prior to 1980—to vote on when it meets next in December 2027.”

Hall of Famer Barry Larkin comes in support of MLB’s policy change

""It would have been super amazing to be able to share his enshrinement with him as with us being from Cincinnati and him being my first manager.”

""He gave me my first opportunity. He’s a guy I grew up idolizing and trying to be like. I feel like it would be a wonderful thing for the west side of Cincinnati, for Cincinnati as a whole and all of Red's land. It will be amazing.”

Chicago White Sox places trust in evaluation process

“Major League Baseball’s decision today allows for 17 players, including eight members of the 1919 White Sox team, to now be eligible for consideration for the Hall of Fame. The White Sox trust that the process currently in place will thoughtfully evaluate each player’s contributions to the game.”

Phillies praise Pete Rose’s contribution in MLB

“The Phillies support today's decision by Commissioner Manfred and Major League Baseball to remove Pete Rose from the permanently ineligible list. As one of the greatest players in the history of the game, Pete made significant on-field contributions to the Phillies over his five seasons (1979-83) with the club, highlighted by our first World Series title in 1980.”

It has been a momentum for a decision to reinstate at least 17 players of the MLB, or “legends,” who will now be eligible for the Hall of Fame. The decision, brought forward by MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred, is being praised by all teams, their managers, and former MLB players.Hall of Fame chairman of the board Jane Forbes Clark also shared what she felt about the policy change. As per her official statement, she said:Cincinnati Reds’ great and Hall of Famer Barry Larkin was also supportive of MLB’s decision. He said:Recalling a memory with Pete Rose, he said:The White Sox released a statement, where they said:The Philadelphia Phillies also shared a statement regarding the new policy.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

As the Timberwolves (29-23) prepare to defend home court at Target Center, Edwards’ availability remains uncertain, adding intrigue to a crucial Western Conference clash.Anthony Edwards has been a key force for Minnesota this season, and his status could significantly impact their game plan. The 22-year-old is coming off a stellar 41-point performance in the Timberwolves’ recent 127-114 victory over the Houston Rockets. His scoring ability and leadership have been vital for the team, making his potential absence a significant concern.The Timberwolves’ official injury report lists Anthony Edwards as questionable with a hip injury, indicating that his status will likely be a game-time decision. Alongside him, Mike Conley (finger) is considered day-to-day, while Donte DiVincenzo (toe) and Julius Randle (groin) have been ruled out.The Trail Blazers (23-29) are also dealing with injury concerns. Deni Avdija (hand) and Scoot Henderson (ankle) are both questionable, while Matisse Thybulle (ankle) has been ruled out.

A 5.7-magnitude earthquake struck Pakistan on Saturday morning, Reuters reported. The tremor occurred just hours after a 4.0-magnitude quake had hit the region.Shallow earthquakes tend to be more dangerous than deeper ones because their seismic waves have a shorter distance to travel to the Earth's surface. This results in stronger ground shaking, increasing the potential for structural damage and higher casualties.Pakistan is among the most seismically active countries in the world due to its position along the boundary between the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. The ongoing collision between these plates generates frequent and often destructive seismic activity.Several major fault lines run through the country, further heightening its vulnerability.

Delhi in race to host playoff ties

MUMBAI: Most overseas players, barring a few Australians and Englishmen, are set to return for IPL 2025 when the tournament resumes on Saturday (May 17), following a week-long suspension due to cross border tensions between India and Pakistan.According to a source, among those who have confirmed their participation are Australian captain Pat Cummins, who is set to lead Australia in the World Test Championship final at Lord’s from June 11, and opener Travis Head.While the return of Sunrisers Hyderabad captain Cummins and Head is good news, the team is already out of the playoff race. SRH have only two matches remaining.The teams currently best placed in terms of overseas player availability are Gujarat Titans, Mumbai Indians and Kolkata Knight Riders, who are all set to be back at full strength.On Tuesday, MI had their first training session at the Wankhede Stadium since the BCCI announced the league’s resumption. captain Rohit Sharma attended the session alongwith overseas players Mitchell Santner, Bevon Jacobs, and Mujeeb Ur Rahman — all of whom had stayed back with the team during the break.The remaining overseas players, including England allrounder Will Jacks and wicketkeeper Ryan Rickelton, are expected to arrive from Thursday. MI restart their campaign against Delhi Capitals on May 21 which gives them ample time to reassemble their squad.In GT’s case, former England white-ball captain Jos Buttler and South African pacer Gerald Coetzee are expected to arrive on Wednesday, while Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada and Sherfane Rutherford had stayed back in India. The Titans are well-positioned to qualify for the playoffs.In a setback for Rajasthan Royals, their bowling coach Shane Bond is “highly unlikely” to return, TOI has learnt. The franchise also remains uncertain about the availability of England pacer Jofra Archer — selected for the England vs West Indies ODI series starting May 29 — and West Indies batter Shimron Hetmyer.Australian pacers Josh Hazlewood (RCB), who is injured, and Mitchell Starc will both skip the remainder of the tournament.Punjab Kings are still unsure about the return of Australian players Josh Inglis and Marcus Stoinis while South African pace all-rounder Marco Jansen remains stationed in Dubai. Inglis has also been picked in Australia’s squad for the WTC final.Meanwhile, a reliable BCCI source told TOI that Delhi is also in contention to host the four IPL-2025 playoff matches, along with Ahmedabad — the likely venue for the final — and Mumbai.“The final was moved out of Kolkata due to forecast of heavy rain around June 3, the scheduled date of the final. Weather forecasts for Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Delhi are currently clear,” the source added.","Most overseas players, barring a few Australians and Englishmen, are set to return for IPL 2025 when the tournament resumes on May 17.

What’s the tile game Meghan Markle played on Netflix? A beginner’s guide to mahjong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/whats-the-tile-game-meghan-markle-played-on-netflix-a-beginners-guide-to-mahjong/articleshow/120736644.cms,"Meghan Markle played the game of Mahjong in her Netflix series

From the Qing dynasty to pop culture

How is mahjong played?

Connor Wan, a 29-year-old British-Chinese artist, learned mahjong while visiting family in Hong Kong. He enjoyed it so much that he started the Four Winds Mahjong Club in London, and later brought it to Toronto after moving there in 2024. “Moving countries is hard, especially when you don’t know anyone,” he said. The club became popular quickly, not as a place for gambling, but for making friends and celebrating Asian culture. Nicole Wong, a writer and audio producer from California, started playing mahjong as a teenager with her grandparents. She later began The Mahjong Project in 2019 to share the game’s cultural stories and organise pop-up game nights. This year, she published a book called Mahjong: House Rules from Across the Asian Diaspora. Nicole says the sound of the tiles is especially powerful. “Mahjong is more than just fun,” she says. “It has a deep history and brings back strong memories.” In Toronto, Robyn Feldberg has taught over 250 people how to play mahjong through her courses. She donates all the money—about $50,000 so far—to charities like Save A Child’s Heart. She says the game is especially popular with young mothers who want a fun way to relax and connect with others. “They tell me, ‘We want something that’s just for us,’” she said.

A centuries-old Chinese game called mahjong is having a modern revival across continents, from luxury cruise ships and trendy hotel lounges to Meghan Markle’s Netflix series.In the sixth episode of her docuseries With Love, the Duchess of Sussex invites friends for a cosy game night – playing mahjong, reports the Globe and Mail.The four-person tile-based game, traditionally associated with Chinese culture, is now catching on with new generations across the globe. “The game itself is really so fun,” says Markle. “But what was so great was the idea of learning something new with your friends, together... the mahjong becomes the background of the expansion of friendship. It’s the feeling of community.”Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China. Traditionally played with 144 tiles, the game blends skill, strategy and a touch of luck. Players pick and discard tiles to form winning hands, much like the card game rummy.The game’s expansion across the world has now erupted into a full-blown trend. The World Mahjong Championship was recently held in Mississauga, Ontario – the first time it’s been hosted in North America. Hotels such as the Ace Hotel New York and Thompson Hotel Dallas regularly hold mahjong-themed nights.Fans with money to spare are buying fancy mahjong sets from Hermès, Louis Vuitton, and Ralph Lauren. Some are even splashing out on luxury tables that shuffle the tiles automatically – costing over $4,500.Even cruise ships have joined the trend, offering mahjong tournaments and special rooms just for playing the game.Mahjong is played with 144 tiles. Players begin by shuffling the tiles face down. Everyone rolls dice and the highest roller becomes the dealer. Each player picks 36 tiles and builds a wall—two rows of 18 tiles. The walls are pushed forward, creating a space in the middle for discards. Each player then draws 13 tiles (the dealer starts with 14), and the game begins.Players take turns drawing one tile and discarding one, always keeping 13 tiles in hand. You can draw a new tile or pick up someone’s discarded one. If a discarded tile helps complete a set (called a meld), you can grab it, announce the set, and show the tiles. To win, a player must have four melds (like three or four matching tiles or a sequence of three in a suit) and one pair (two matching tiles)—making 14 tiles total.There are five types of tiles: Bamboo, Characters, Dots (these are the three main suits), and special tiles called Honors (Dragons and Winds) and Bonus (Flowers and Seasons). Each suit goes from 1 to 9. Honors and Bonus tiles add extra excitement but aren't needed to win. Mahjong mixes strategy and memory with a bit of luck—and it’s all about building the right sets before your opponents do.For many mahjong fans, it’s not just a game but a deeply social experience.","Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China.

Replenishing bowling resources

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on IPL, India-Australia rivalry | Part 1

India's Test team has been staring at generational change for a while now. The murmurs of transition started with Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane losing their places three years ago. When Gautam Gambhir was appointed head coach last year, it was perceived as a forward-thinking move meant to shake things up and usher in fresh blood. In that context, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma's retirements may be perceived as part of the process the selection committee and management envisioned for the team.There seems to be only way ahead — invest heavily in talented youth who can form the core of the Test team in time. The returns are not to be judged immediately.This isn't an unfamiliar scenario in Indian cricket. When Sachin Tendulkar retired in 2013 within a year of Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman calling it quits, the concerns were not too dissimilar. India went through the throes of transition for a good three years before becoming a force in Test cricket under Kohli's leadership.Former India wicketkeeper Saba Karim, a national selector at that time, says, ""We had MS Dhoni leading the team. He was clear how he wanted to shape the team and who were his best bets. There was clarity that we had to be ready to move on from Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag. Dhoni was the most important person.""Kohli, Pujara and Rahane were all in and around the Test team. It helped that all three of them succeeded in South Africa in 2013 immediately after Tendulkar retired. The team wasn't winning but we were heading in the right direction. It was apparent that once Kohli took up the No. 4 position, he would form the core of the batting lineup,"" Karim told TOI.This time around, there's no obvious leader in the team. Coach Gambhir came in with the mandate to usher in changes at the earliest. Now it's time to execute those plans. ""Gambhir becomes the most important person here. He has to give confidence to the players. The first thing he needs to do is understand the new captain, the vision he has and the brand of cricket he wants the team to play,"" Karim said.Gambhir can now become the most powerful head coach India have ever had. In 2017, Anil Kumble tried to enforce himself but then-captain Kohli had the last word. Yet, Gambhir has to tread carefully here. ""Gambhir has clear ideas about how he wants his team to approach a game. But he needs to be the man who empowers players and creates leaders in the team. I'm sure he'll back someone like Rishabh Pant, who hit a rough patch in Australia, and give him more confidence on the upcoming, tough tour of England,"" former national selector Devang Gandhi said.It's not just about filling the void left by Rohit and Kohli. Not too long ago, India boasted of an enviable bowling attack that could hurt opposition teams irrespective of the nature of pitches and conditions. The famed pace attack of Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav were handed the mantle starting from 2012-13.""Those bowlers, including Bhuvneshwar Kumar, were identified for the longer run. They initially struggled to bowl out opposition batters even overseas. But the idea was to zero in on a pool of bowlers and keep working with them. Credit must go to Kohli for turning things around when he decided to play five bowlers in Tests. That regulated the workload of the pacers and became a metric going forward. Similarly, if you have identified the likes of Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep and Arshdeep, then stick with the pool,"" Karim said.Gandhi revisited the process of creating a strong backup in 2020 with the help of Rahul Dravid, who looked after the NCA and India's developmental sides. ""The primary job of our selection committee was to create bench strength. I went to eight ‘A' tours as a selector and had robust discussions with Dravid. Mohammed Siraj, Shardul Thakur and Navdeep Saini were ready to step up. India has to focus on red-ball ‘A' tours. The white-ball team will take care of itself because we have such a strong tournament like the IPL,"" Gandhi said.In all the hype around the pace attack, one may have ignored the lack of resources in the spin-bowling department. ""We chose R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja to lead the spin attack and it paid off. Probably, they need to give Kuldeep Yadav more game time and groom the likes of Sai Kishore and Washington Sundar,"" Karim said.It's going to be a tough road ahead for India's Test team. Persistence and patience seem to be the need of the hour.",Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have retired from Test cricket. Head coach Gautam Gambhir is now the most powerful figure in India's setup.

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

Unifying a team for a common cause

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on IPL, India-Australia rivalry | Part 1

A two-hour talkathon

""Let's give them 60 overs of hell!"" Years down the line, when historians will revisit Indian Test cricket in the 21st century, Virat Kohli's war cry at the Lord's in 2021 will ring in their ears.That London summer afternoon defined the Kohli-way — a new era of self-belief when India refused to throw in the towel even when the chips were down.The team, after a miraculous ninth-wicket partnership between Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami on the fifth morning, could have veered towards the safer confines of an honourable draw.But the captain didn't believe in settling for a draw, even while playing overseas. The 151-run win on that day was the highest point for Kohli the captain — arguably a more remarkable figure than Kohli the batter, at least in Test cricket.That day, the basis of that confidence to push for a win at Lord's lay in the belief that Kohli had in his pace quartet of Bumrah, Shami, Mohammed Siraj and Ishant Sharma. It was an attack that was meticulously curated by Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri, with the help of bowling coach Bharath Arun.In many ways, Kohli's decision to rely on out-and-out pace was a leaf out of a decision that the young Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi took as captain in the 1960s, to rely on a magnificent battery of spinners to churn out results.In Bishan Singh Bedi, Erapalli Prasanna and BS Chandrasekhar, Pataudi had a supremely gifted trio. S Venkataraghavan, who made his debut in 1965, was made a regular part of the spin attack as India played with four spinners for the first time at Edgbaston in 1967.Playing in tandem, the quartet restricted England to 298 and 203, only to be let down by the batters. But they laid a marker that was to define Indian cricket for the next decade, aptly summed up by Kapil Dev in Tim Wigmore's Test Cricket: A History: ""Almost every Indian bowler in that era wanted to be a spinner.""Half a century later, in 2018, Kohli took the call to play four pacers in Perth. Much like Pataudi's Edgbaston experience, India lost that Test despite the skipper scoring a magnificent century, but India had well and truly taken a step in a different direction.As Prasanna and Bedi have insisted that ""playing under Tiger was no strain"", the likes of Ishant Sharma and Shami flourished under Kohli. But the captain's biggest contribution will be the 'Kohinoor' he gifted to Indian Test cricket — Bumrah, the pace parallel of the maverick leggie Chandrasekhar.The slinger was superb in white-ball cricket, but no one believed he could last the rigours of Test cricket till Kohli and Shastri decided otherwise. The duo nurtured him and introduced him to Test cricket in South Africa in 2018. It would prove the birth of the 'Bradman of pace bowling' — termed by Adam Gilchrist — as India took their first step towards world domination in red-ball cricket, culminating in two back-to-back series wins in Australia.Pataudi, as Indian captain, had brought in a unification code to a largely disjointed team. ""Our side was dominated by players from the West and South and it was difficult for a Punjabi like myself to be accepted. But it was Tiger who gave us the feeling of Indian-ness,"" Bedi says in Wigmore's book.Fifty years down the line, Kohli, too, tried to unify the team through a common code — fitness. He learnt early that to excel in 21st century cricket, fitness had to be of a different level. He brought changes to his lifestyle and diet to himself become the lean, mean machine.He also tried to instill the same in his team, to follow a similar mantra. It meant that the envelope was pushed. If the pace bowlers, on the final session of the final day, were ready to bowl 140 km/hr, a lot to do with the culture of fitness that was brought in by Kohli.Kohli didn't mind the odd exchange of words with the opposition on the field, but there's one instance when his anger was channelized towards his own team. According to a member of the management, Kohli was livid with the way India capitulated in the first Test in Cape Town, chasing 208.""Vernon Philander destroyed us with his medium-pace in the second innings, Kohli couldn't take it anymore. We never heard him speaking as harshly as he did to the team members — for about two hours on that day. He made it clear that such a performance was just not acceptable. By the time we got into the team bus, we knew something had to be changed,"" a team member told TOI.Kohli walked the talk in the next Test in Centurion with a century, albeit in a losing cause. But India won the third Test on a minefield in Johannesburg. The first step towards world domination had been taken.",Virat Kohli's decision to rely on out-and-out pace was a leaf out of a decision that the young Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi took as captain in the early 1960s. India played with four spinners for the first time at Edgbaston in 1967.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

Poll Do you believe Kohli's retirement will affect India's Test team performance? No, the team will adapt Yes, it's a huge loss

NEW DELHI: As the cricketing world comes to terms with Virat Kohli ’s sudden retirement from Test cricket , tributes continue to pour in for a player widely regarded as one of the finest to ever don the whites for India. Kohli, who announced his retirement via a social media post on Monday — ""#269, signing off"" — brought an end to a glorious 14-year red-ball career.The former India captain finishes with 9,230 runs in 123 Tests, including 30 centuries, and a formidable legacy as India’s most successful Test captain with 40 wins in 68 matches. But beyond the numbers, many believe Kohli’s impact goes far deeper — he filled two massive voids left by legends Sachin Tendulkar and MS Dhoni Former India cricketer Robin Uthappa summed up Kohli’s dual legacy aptly on Star Sports: ""He wore two crowns when he landed in Test cricket. India needed an incredible batter after Sachin Tendulkar and a great captain after MS Dhoni. Interestingly, Virat filled both those shoes. That is his legacy in Test cricket.""Former teammate Suresh Raina echoed similar sentiments, praising Kohli’s unmatched intensity and leadership.""The fitness, fighting spirit, and the brand he has become — I haven’t seen a player like him,"" Raina said. He recalled Kohli’s debut in the West Indies, facing the fiery pace of Fidel Edwards and Ravi Rampaul, saying, ""He didn’t care about the helmet being hit. He wanted to play strongly. That attitude is what changed the table for India. He’s one of the best.""Raina also highlighted Kohli’s transformational leadership in historic overseas victories, especially in Australia and South Africa — tours that defined India's modern Test dominance.With Kohli now walking away from the longest format, Indian cricket loses a figure who didn’t just play — he carried the team with charisma, grit, and a ferocious will to win.","Former India captain Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on IPL, India-Australia rivalry | Part 1

Indian cricket bears shades of the rebuilding phase of Australian cricket in the mid-1980s. R Ashwin Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli all played their last Tests in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia.In 1983-84, three Aussie greats played their last Test in the home series against Pakistan. With Kim Hughes at the helm, wicketkeeper Rod Marsh, premier batter Greg Chappell and pace legend Dennis Lillee, all called it a day after the Sydney Test.Chappell made his intentions clear after the second day of the Test. Lillee echoed the same later that evening. Marsh made his unavailability clear for the next series before the conclusion of that last Test.Cut to 2024-25. Ashwin played the Adelaide Test and left the tour a few days later after not being picked for the third Test in Brisbane. Kohli's last Test was also the last of that series, in Sydney. Rohit's last Test, as it turned out, would be MCG's Boxing Day Test.While the contributions of Ashwin, Rohit and Kohli in whites are of high value, all three were struggling in Tests of late. Ashwin's inclusion in away Tests was always in doubt when India played with a lone spinner.Rohit was a Test cricket survivor and opportunist. In Australia, England and South Africa, his figures read 45 innings, one hundred and five fifties.As for Kohli, his angular vertical bat pointing towards mid-on while deciding whether to play or leave deliveries outside the off stump was a painful sight Down Under.India, however, will miss them. After all, it is not easy for a team to replace quality regulars and still retain composure and consistency. When Marsh-Greg-Lillee called it quits, Australia went through a lengthy rebuilding process under Allan Border. They won their first major series — the 1989 Ashes in England — four-and-a-half years later! In between, they lost to West Indies thrice, to England and NZ twice each, lost in Pakistan and could not beat India over a couple of series.While India are expected to face a bumpy road ahead in Tests, the situation doesn't seem that alarming. To expect a Test series win against either South Africa, Australia, England or New Zealand won't be beyond reach — an unlikely plus from the mingling of world stars and young Indian players through white-ball cricket. Unlike in the 1980s, the young Indians are not short on confidence or in awe of rival teams either, an ethos drilled by the leadership of Kohli and Rohit.The Greg-Marsh-Lillee exit void was certainly bigger than the current Indian one. India are expected to be served well by KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant, Jasprit Bumrah and Shubman Gill in Tests, even though the five-Test tour of England is a tough assignment. Chief selector Ajit Agarkar and coach Gautam Gambhir will have to tackle the captaincy issue prudently. The Aussies continued with Kim Hughes for seven more Tests before Allan Border replaced him midway against the West Indies in 1984-85.India will have to name a new captain right away. When Rohit was not available for the opening Test, India won under Bumrah. When Kohli was unavailable after Adelaide's ‘36 all out' fiasco in 2020-21, India went on to win the series under Ajinkya Rahane. No one is indispensable, be it Rohit Sharma or Virat Kohli.","Ashwin, Rohit and Kohli's departure has shades of the Chappell-Marsh-Lillee exit in Australia, which triggered a long rebuilding phase.

Virat Kohli drops retirement bombshell | Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket

When we talk about Virat Kohli , Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and dressing room stories, one name that immediately comes to mind is AB de Villiers , given the kind of bond they have shared over the years. But last week, everyone was in for a pleasant surprise when Virat Kohli credited former South African wicketkeeper-batter Mark Boucher for guiding him during the early years of his international and Indian Premier League (IPL) career. ""Actually, of all the players I played with initially, Mark Boucher had the biggest impact on me,"" Kohli told the ‘RCB Bold Diaries’ podcast. The duo spent three years at RCB.In 2008, Mark Boucher saw Kohli’s potential and told him he would be doing a disservice to himself if he failed to make it to the senior Indian team. He took a young 20-year-old under his wings, helped him practice during net sessions and become battle-ready for the bouncy tracks in South Africa and Australia.""I just tried to help him in his development at that particular stage. He had everything in his game. I think the one thing we did talk about was the short ball and how to play the short ball,"" Boucher said in a conversation on Monday (May 12), the day Kohli announced his retirement from Test cricket ""I think the short ball is something that a youngster always gets tested with. I told him, 'Virat, because you're so good off the front foot when the ball's straight, they're going to test you on the back foot when you arrive on the international scene. If you play it well, very quickly they'll go away from bowling short at you'. I just said to him, 'if you arrive on South African shores, we would definitely test you on the short ball knowing that you come from the subcontinent.'""'When you go to Australia, they're definitely going to test you on the short ball because you've come from the subcontinent.' I think my conversations were just trying to help him find his next level and making him aware of what other teams would do to him. From there, he took it upon himself.""""He said to me, 'Bach, can you help me?' I was like, 'Yes, absolutely.' I went and served a couple of tennis balls at him, showed him one or two little techniques. I just worked on a couple of things, tried to impart a little bit of my knowledge on playing the short ball, especially coming from South Africa where you get tested quite a bit.""I did say to him one day, it's not a nice exercise to go into a net and have to work on the short ball because sometimes you do get hurt. Sometimes you get one or two balls around the ears, and it's not nice having to go through that and getting hit on the helmet every now and again. But I think this is where his feistiness and his character came through. He was really eager to become a better cricketer. He really enjoyed the challenge of me hitting tennis balls at his head.""We had a laugh, and it was good fun because I think he trusted that it was coming from a good place from my side. I really enjoyed it because here I am working with someone who at that stage I thought could be the next superstar in Indian cricket. He's lived up to that.""Boucher vividly remembers the first time he met Virat and how the ""feistiness"" in a young Delhi lad caught his attention and reminded him of a younger version of himself.""He was, how do I put it, quite an easy person to speak to. He was very open to listening to people who were older than him and probably more experienced than him. He had a bit – it's difficult to say attitude because attitude comes across the wrong way – but he had a character that he was quite feisty and out there. He loved to be competitive, which I really enjoyed about him because I think I was probably similar when I was a youngster,"" recalls Boucher.""What did stand out was his talent that he had, and if you've got talent and you've got character that comes with it and the feistiness to want to succeed, I think it's always a recipe for success,"" he adds.A young Virat made the most out of Boucher's experience and their initial conversations continued to revolve around cricket. The former cricketer still remembers the chat they had on the art of playing spin, and how it left a lasting impression on Boucher.""I actually chatted to him a lot about spin bowling and how Indian cricketers play spin bowling to try and pick his brain a bit on how they develop from a very young age and what sort of techniques they have to counter the spinning ball,"" he says.""I actually remember the conversation that we had, and it went along the lines of, I just said, 'Virat, you're very talented and you're very young.' You've got the IPL ahead of you now. You're probably going to play close to 20 years of IPL cricket. Sachin Tendulkar started off at a very young age as well, and who's to say that you couldn't be the next Sachin Tendulkar?' I didn't know that he was going to take everything this far and sort of create his own legacy.""Over the years, Virat Kohli carried the burden of being the next Sachin Tendulkar but Boucher staunchly believes it is unfair to compare Tendulkar and Kohli. He sums it up with a crisp response: ""To mention him and Sachin would be doing a disservice to both of them. I think there's only ever one Sachin Tendulkar, and I think there's only ever one Virat Kohli. Both of them are absolute legends of the game.""When it comes to Kohli , a lot of tags have followed him over the years. From being termed arrogant to egoistic, the former India skipper had to deal with a lot of outside noise during his Test career but he managed to deliver the results which were never seen in Indian cricket before. It was under his captaincy that India witnessed a glorious period in Test cricket where they won 40 of the 68 games Kohli led in, losing just 17. The 40 wins made Kohli India's most successful Test captain of all time.""When he stepped into the Indian cricket team, the way that he led people, I think sometimes people were saying it was arrogance, but I don't see it as arrogance. I see it as confidence and also a particular guy who's got a little bit of a different attitude to maybe your normal Indian cricketer. He was never going to stand back and be bullied or pushed into a corner by any other cricketer, which is right,"" says Boucher.""No cricketer should stand back, especially if you're playing for your country. You've earned the right to play for your country, and so has the individual on the other end. There should never be a situation where you feel like you need to be undermined by the opposition. If you can take it, you can give it back. If you give it, you must be able to take it as well. I think Virat was very much like that,"" he adds.Boucher further explains how that Virat inspired the current generation of cricketers with his ""in your face"" attitude. The feistiness, fitness and overall dedication have been hallmarks of Kohli's career and it has rubbed off on the future players as well.""Certainly, he started what the younger generation is now living through as well. They don't stand back for anyone. They're very aggressive. They're in your face. There's a line for everything. You don't want to cross the line or the legality of the game.""But certainly, they go out there, and they don't feel intimidated by anyone. Where maybe in the past, before the Kohli era, maybe there was a little bit of intimidation that crept in. He certainly changed that and changed the way that any young Indian cricketer being brought up in today's world, they're a lot tougher.""Kohli and his old friend ""Bach"" continue to be in touch after all these years but the conversations have now moved on from short-pitch bowling to family and fatherhood.",Virat Kohli announced his retirement from Test cricket on May 12. Kohli credited former South African wicketkeeper-batter Mark Boucher for guiding him during the early years of his international and Indian Premier League (IPL) career.
