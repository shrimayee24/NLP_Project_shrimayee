Poll Is Vaibhav Suryavanshi the future star of Indian cricket? Not sure yet Maybe, let's see Absolutely

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals ' 14-year-old sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi stole the show on Monday with a breathtaking 101 off just 38 balls against Gujarat Titans at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur. In an innings studded with 11 sixes and seven fours, the teenager shattered multiple records and led the Royals to a commanding eight-wicket win with 25 balls to spare.Chasing a daunting target of 210, Suryavanshi and Yashasvi Jaiswal (unbeaten on 70 off 40 balls) put on a whirlwind 166-run opening stand in just 11.5 overs, dismantling a Titans attack boasting Mohammed Siraj, Ishant Sharma, Prasidh Krishna, Rashid Khan, and Sai Kishore.The highlight was Suryavanshi's 35-ball century, making him the youngest player to score a hundred in senior T20 cricket at just 14 years and 32 days. He surpassed Maharashtra's Vijay Zol, who previously held the record at 18 years and 118 days. Suryavanshi also became the fastest Indian to an IPL century, breaking Yusuf Pathan's 37-ball record set in 2010.Suryavanshi's blitz made a mockery of the chase and ensured the Royals' slim playoff hopes remained alive. They climbed to eighth place with six points, while Gujarat Titans slipped to third after suffering their third defeat in nine games.Earlier, Shubman Gill 's 50-ball 84 and Jos Buttler's 26-ball unbeaten 50 had set up what seemed a formidable total for the Titans. However, once Suryavanshi started launching balls into the stands, there was little the Titans could do to stem the onslaught.""His hitting was tremendous,"" said Titans skipper Gill after the match. Jaiswal, the Royals' senior opener, summed it up simply: ""Incredible, one of the best innings I have seen. I just told him to keep going.""While India has seen prodigies fade under the weight of early fame, Suryavanshi's rare talent is a gift that needs careful nurturing. It will be interesting to see what is in store in the next chapter of this extraordinary story.","14-year-old sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi scores 101 off just 38 balls against Gujarat Titans.

While the Cybertruck can give around 510 km per charge, the Cadillac Escalade can give 745 km per charge, reportedly.When another guest mentioned how Shaq always brings the most expensive cars to work when he goes to the set of Inside The NBA, Shaq joked, “I treat them like girlfriends, my police car girlfriend I haven’t seen in a while so I will probably take her on a date tonight.

NEW DELHI: There has been a lot of chatter among cricket fans regarding Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) owner Sanjiv Goenka 's strict approach. Many believe Goenka demands strong results from his team. The discussions intensified recently after Goenka’s interactions with Rishabh Pant following LSG’s defeats sparked fresh speculation.The conversation around Goenka’s involvement began last year when he was seen having a heated discussion with then-captain KL Rahul after LSG’s heavy loss to SunRisers Hyderabad.

He was making the 11s, making all the changes, and planning. But this year, I don't feel like that. This year, after Zaheer Khan has come, I feel like he is talking to everyone. If you see, there is a discussion going on, they are talking to each other. With Digvesh Rathi the coach was talking,"" Mishra said on Cricbuzz.""If you talk about the owner, I never felt he was too involved. Of course, he wanted the team to win. But we did lose matches and after that he never talked loudly or said anything wrong. I feel that the media has shown a little too much. I didn't feel that there was anything negative like that. But if there is any owner, he says that losing is okay, but just go out there and show some fight.""Fight and lose, I have no problem. This is what people told me. This is what happened. Even after losing badly in Kolkata and Hyderabad, the owner came into the dressing room and motivated the team.

Why the Los Angeles Lakers Might Consider Trading LeBron James for Giannis Antetokounmpo

""Rob Pelinka could decide to ignore any loyalty to LeBron and trade the 40-year-old star to the Bucks for Giannis Antetokounmpo, thereby creating a Luka-Giannis pairing that would be more potent than the current Luka-LeBron duo.""

The Mechanics of a Potential Trade

Key Factor



Details



LeBron’s Player Option



LeBron James holds a $52.6M option for 2025-26. If he opts in, he can veto any trade due to his no-trade clause.



New Contract Possibility



If LeBron signs a new deal without a no-trade clause, the Los Angeles Lakers could move him mid-season.



Salary Matching



A third team may be needed to balance salaries, as Giannis Antetokounmpo is owed $121.2M over the next two years.

Jacksonville Jaguars’ 2025 draft blunder: Skipping defensive tackle could ruin their season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jacksonville-jaguars-2025-draft-blunder-skipping-defensive-tackle-could-ruin-their-season/articleshow/120698654.cms,"Defensive struggles continue to haunt the Jaguars (Imagn Images)

Defensive struggles continue to haunt the Jaguars



Trusting the development of young defensive tackles

The 2025 NFL Draft has come and gone, and teams are now left to reflect on their selections and the holes they still need to fill. For the Jacksonville Jaguars , one glaring question remains: Why didn't they draft a defensive tackle despite their struggles on defense last season? The team’s decision not to address this need is raising eyebrows, especially given their poor performance in critical areas like run defense and pass rushing.The Jaguars' defense has been far from elite, ranking 31st in the NFL by allowing 5.9 yards per play last season. Adding to the concern, they were last in both pass yards allowed and forced turnovers, with a dismal total of only nine takeaways. The interior defensive line has been particularly problematic, struggling to stop the run and pressure the quarterback. This led many to believe that the team would use their draft picks to bolster the defensive tackle position.However, Jacksonville's front office took a different approach. Despite these glaring defensive issues, general manager James Gladstone explained that the team chose not to ""reach for a player"" at defensive tackle. This decision suggests a strong belief in the young players already on the roster and a commitment to developing them further in Year 2.The Jaguars are putting their trust in young defensive tackles Maason Smith and Jordan Jefferson to improve their performances. Smith, in particular, showed promise towards the end of the 2024 season, recording two sacks and three tackles for loss over the final three games. The team hopes this momentum will carry over into the new season, providing the interior rush that has been lacking.Additionally, the move to shift Arik Armstead back inside from defensive end is expected to give the defensive line a boost. Armstead’s versatility and experience could provide the needed push for the Jaguars' defensive front to perform better against both the run and the pass.Also Read: “Have lost faith in Justin Tucker”: Ravens’ decision to draft Tyler Loop hints at the end of Justin Tucker’s future in the team amidst his ongoing scandal This decision may be a gamble, but the Jaguars are confident in the potential of their younger players. By avoiding the defensive tackle position in the draft, they are sending a message that they believe their existing talent can rise to the occasion. Only time will tell if this strategy will pay off, or if it will come back to haunt them as they face more powerful offenses in 2025.","The Jaguars' defense has been far from elite, ranking 31st in the NFL by allowing 5.9 yards per play last season.

Jalen Hurts will not attend Eagles White House visit, per official



Jalen Hurts' awkward TIME100 Gala moment fueled early speculation



Saquon Barkley and others are attending while Jalen Hurts stayed away



It’s official: Jalen Hurts won’t be at the White House today when the Eagles celebrate their Super Bowl win. According to a White House official, he’s got ""scheduling conflicts,"" but fans aren’t exactly buying that. Especially after his pretty awkward red carpet moment earlier this week, where he basically dodged the question altogether.Philadelphia Eagles quarterback and Super Bowl MVP Jalen Hurts has officially skipped the team’s visit to the White House today. According to NBC’s White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor, a White House official confirmed that Hurts would not be attending, along with a few other players, due to ""scheduling conflicts.""The Eagles visited Washington, D.C., following their thrilling Super Bowl win, but the absence of one of the team's biggest stars didn’t go unnoticed by fans and they have a lot to say.Interestingly, rumors that Hurts might miss the White House event had already started circulating days ago. During the TIME100 Gala earlier this week, Hurts was asked point-blank if he would attend the celebration. His response? A noticeable hesitation, an awkward pause, and no direct answer, basically leaving fans scratching their heads.So when the official word came today that he wasn’t going, it didn’t exactly shock anyone. But it definitely added fuel to the fire about why he really skipped it.This isn’t the first time the Eagles have had drama around a White House visit. Back in 2018, after their Super Bowl win, the team famously declined to attend the White House under then-President Donald Trump. That ended with Trump rescinding the invitation altogether, blaming the controversy over national anthem protests. Fast forward to 2025, and although the Eagles this time “enthusiastically accepted” President Trump's new invitation, team owner Jeffrey Lurie made it very clear: attendance was 100% optional.Not every player bailed, though. Running back Saquon Barkley showed up at the White House and even squeezed in a round of golf with Trump before the event. Meanwhile, Hurts and a few other unnamed players chose not to attend, citing “scheduling conflicts” as the official reason.Still, plenty of fans aren’t buying it. To them, it looks a lot more like Hurts quietly distancing himself rather than just being too busy.Whether or not Jalen Hurts intended to make a political statement, his absence from today’s ceremony proves one thing: in 2025, the line between sports, politics, and personal beliefs is thinner than ever. And with the NFL's massive spotlight, every decision, even ones as small as a ""scheduling conflict"" gets analyzed under a microscope.Also read - Jaxson Dart’s hunting photos go viral: Fans call on NY Giants to take action","The Eagles visited Washington, D.C., following their thrilling Super Bowl win, but the absence of one of the team's biggest stars didn't go unnoticed by fans.

The Tennessee Titans didn’t just draft a quarterback; they staked their future on one. When their moment came in Detroit at the 2025 NFL Draft, Brian Callahan and new GM Mike Borgonzi didn’t blink. They grabbed Cam Ward with the first overall pick, setting off fireworks and, quietly, a storm of second-guessing across the league. For a franchise desperate to escape mediocrity, this was more than a gamble, it was an all-in bet on a young man who talks as boldly as he plays.Leading up to draft night, Titans coaches and scouts spent months picking apart every snap Ward played from his days lighting it up at Incarnate Word to his final season at Miami. The arm strength was impressive. The playmaking was electric. But they needed to know if the confidence was real or just another sales pitch.In a closed-door meeting, Ward made it crystal clear.he said.Bold words. But Callahan wasn’t impressed just yet. He pushed back, calling it the oldest line in the book. Was Ward just repeating what he thought they wanted to hear?Ward didn’t back down.That moment stuck. It wasn’t rehearsed, it was real. And it sealed the Titans’ decision.Picking Cam Ward wasn’t the ""safe"" move. Some scouts loved him, some had their doubts. His last season had flashes of brilliance but also rough patches.

Damian Lillard's injury casts a shadow over Milwaukee Bucks' playoff hopes

During Game 4 against Indiana Pacers Damian Lillard suffered an ankle injury to his left ankle which forced him to leave the match due to a potential serious medical concern. The Bucks face severe danger in the playoffs with a 3-1 deficit in the series after their loss made them fall to 2-1. The team along with its supporters awaits the results of Lillard's MRI while staying alert about a crucial postseason change.During Game 4 of the 2025 NBA Playoffs Milwaukee Bucks star Damian Lillard sustained an ankle injury to his left foot shortly after the first quarter started versus Indiana Pacers. Lillard experienced unbearable pain by holding his leg as medical staff had to help him off the court before he lost the ability to stand on his left foot. The Bucks team doctors announced Lillard's absence from the game which medical examinations suggested damages to his Achilles tendon. The evaluation of Lillard's injury will be performed through an MRI scan to identify its severity.This is a real tough break for Lillard, who had only just made his comeback after being diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right calf in March. That kept him out for the end of the regular season, but he was finally cleared to play right before the playoffs kicked off. His return in Game 2 was a big deal, showing he could overcome challenges, but now this new injury has everyone worried about his health and the Bucks' shot at the championship.After Lillard left the game, the Bucks had a tough time keeping their energy up. Giannis Antetokounmpo was the standout with 28 points and 15 rebounds, but without Lillard, their offense just didn't have the same fire. The Pacers took full advantage, with Myles Turner putting up 23 points and Tyrese Haliburton adding 17 points, 15 assists, and 8 rebounds. Indiana shot better than 60% from the field and kept a solid lead the whole game, finishing with a 129-103 win.""This is a tough one, honestly. Blood clot, followed by [Achilles]. ... He's just a great freakin' dude, as a teammate and a father. No one deserves it.""

Shedeur Sanders’ NFL Draft Fall: Bruce Feldman explains how NFL teams got it wrong



Shedeur Sanders Pro Day ""Revealed Potentially Devastating Flaw?!"" | Pat McAfee Show

""So much of being an NFL backup quarterback is how comfortable the starter is with the other two QBs in the room.

Sanders

has always been the starting QB and the star wherever he’s been, at Jackson State and then Colorado. I suspect his fit played a role in why so many teams opted not to pick him earlier,""

Was Shedeur Sanders the hidden gem of the 2025 NFL Draft?



Shedeur Sanders was supposed to be one of the hottest prospects in the 2025 NFL Draft. But when the former Colorado Buffaloes star fell all the way to the fifth round, taken at pick No. 144 by the Cleveland Browns , it left fans and analysts stunned. How could a player with his pedigree, who was once projected to go in the top five slip so drastically? Was it a major misjudgment by NFL teams, or is there something deeper behind his unexpected fall?Despite Shedeur Sanders' hype, several NFL teams passed on him for lesser-known quarterbacks. Bruce Feldman of The Athletic suggests the reason was chemistry. Teams doubted Sanders’ ability to adapt to a backup role, as he’s always been the star quarterback and leader at every level.Feldman stated.But that’s not the whole story. Anonymous NFL scouts have been outspoken about Sanders’ performance, with one offensive coordinator even suggesting that Sanders isn’t a complete quarterback. While they praised his intelligence and toughness, they criticized his inconsistent play, citing his 94 sacks over two seasons at Colorado as a major red flag. His perceived lack of elite arm strength and running ability only added fuel to the fire.The truth is, Sanders’ fall could be one of the biggest mistakes in recent draft history. His college career at Colorado demonstrated poise, leadership, and a skill set that should have positioned him much higher in the draft. Yet, as the NFL focused on his perceived weaknesses, they overlooked his potential for growth. Now, as a Cleveland Brown in a competitive quarterback room with Dillon Gabriel, Kenny Pickett, and Joe Flacco, Sanders has the chance to turn his critics into believers.Also Read: Saquon Barkley reacts to White House visit with President Trump: Here’s how he responded—“Now Ya Get Out My Mentions” Shedeur Sanders’ unexpected slide to the fifth round could actually be a great thing for his career. With something to prove, he’s ready to make his mark in the NFL. Whether he meets the high expectations or becomes a warning for other teams, Sanders is determined to show that his draft fall was a mistake teams will regret.",Shedeur Sanders was projected to go in the top five in the 2025 NFL Draft.

In red-hot form, Gujarat Titans will look to tighten their grip on the top spot and edge closer to a playoff berth when they face Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League on Monday. Perched atop the 10-team table with six wins from eight matches, the Shubman Gill-led Titans require just two more victories to seal qualification.Functioning like a well-oiled machine, Gujarat have lost only twice this season. Sai Sudharsan and Prasidh Krishna have been standout performers, leading the Orange and Purple Cap races, respectively. Gill, Sudharsan, and Jos Buttler have each amassed over 300 runs at strike rates exceeding 150, showcasing consistency and firepower.Despite Kagiso Rabada’s early departure, Gujarat’s bowling has flourished. Prasidh has claimed 16 wickets at a stunning average of 14.12, while Mohammed Siraj and R Sai Kishore have picked up 12 wickets each, providing crucial breakthroughs.In stark contrast, Rajasthan Royals are almost out of the playoffs race following a narrow loss to Royal Challengers Bengaluru. With five consecutive defeats, the Royals are ninth on the table. While Yashasvi Jaiswal, Riyan Parag, and Nitish Rana have shown promise, their bowling failures have left them playing for pride in their remaining games.The Royals have lost both their home matches so far — by nine wickets against RCB and by two runs against LSG. At the Sawai Mansingh Stadium , the square boundaries measure 67m and 63m, with a straight boundary of 73m. The pitch offers an even covering of grass, suggesting good pace and bounce for the fast bowlers. However, with a few bare patches and a hot day ahead, the surface is expected to be dry.

Doc Rivers sends heartbreaking message after Damian Lillard's injury

The Milwaukee Bucks entered Sunday night’s playoff clash against the Indiana Pacers hoping to even up the series. Instead, their night ended in heartbreak. Not only did Milwaukee suffer a crushing 129 to 103 defeat in Game 4, but they also lost star guard Damian Lillard to a feared Achilles injury . It was a devastating blow that now leaves their season hanging by a thread.Milwaukee’s struggles deepened early in Sunday’s contest when Damian Lillard , who had recently returned after a month-long absence due to blood clot issues , went down with a non-contact injury just six minutes into the game. The initial fear from the Bucks' bench and later echoed by insiders was that the 33-year-old guard had suffered a torn Achilles.Following the game, head coach Doc Rivers was visibly shaken while speaking to reporters in Indiana. ""I knew it right away,"" Rivers said, referring to the moment Lillard went down. ""It is not very promising. I feel bad for him. The guy tried to come back for his team.""Rivers did not stop there. He shared an emotional tribute to Lillard, not just as a player but as a person. ""This is a tough one, honestly,"" Rivers added. ""Blood clot, followed by Achilles. He is just a great freakin' dude, as a teammate and a father. No one deserves it.""Before this latest setback, Lillard had been trying to find his rhythm after missing time.

Lol some people are really upset cause I played golf and flew to the White House with the President. Maybe I just respect the office, not a hard concept to understand,

Why Saquon Barkley’s White House visit with President Trump has everyone talking

He further clarified that he had also enjoyed a round of golf with former President Obama, showing that his actions weren’t about endorsing one political figure over another, but rather about respecting the institution itself.Barkley wasn’t in Washington to engage in politics, but to enjoy a friendly game of golf with a sitting president.

Many critics argued that an athlete’s public interactions with political figures could be seen as an endorsement, whether intentional or not.Barkley’s White House visit shines a light on the often contentious intersection of sports and politics .

Frederik Andersen had to suddenly leave the game and will have to depend on Pyotr Kochetkov in goal

Hurricanes' Frederik Andersen Heads To Dressing Room After Collision With Timo Meier

Canes' Brind'Amour asked about update on injured goalie Frederik Andersen

An obstacle was set before the Carolina Hurricanes during Game 4 of their Eastern Conference First Round clash against the New Jersey Devils, with goalie Frederik Andersen leaving after a collision with forward Timo Meier; this raised severe concerns as to whether he would be able to continue. The Hurricanes did obtain a very important win to take the series lead at 3-1, but much of the focus now transfers to Andersen's health, which casts a big shadow across their playoff campaign.Carolina's entry into the playoffs seemed destined for glory and filled with unexpected twists that made it so, halfway through the second period, with an injury to one of the postseason's stellar goalies, Frederik Andersen, who had to leave the ice after Timo Meier accidentally crashed into him. Meier was ruled to have interfered with the goalie with an on-ice major, but the review overturned the penalty call as a result. With Andersen gone, backup goalie Kochetkov stepped in, and he showed he belonged in this very tough moment.However, Andersen exited with six saves, but he had been an important piece of the Hurricanes in this year’s playoffs, boasting the best goals-against average of 1.59 and the second-best save percentage of .936 in the league. His exit had thrown Carolina’s tempo out of sync and started to put the cautionary tales of Andersen's history, including a surgery for an injured knee that kept him out for much of the regular season.Head coach Rod Brind'Amour told the media after the game that there was uncertainty about the state of Andersen, saying that there would be other evaluations, and there were no further updates offered during Monday's media availability, which has left the fans and analysts contemplating the goaltender's immediate future in the playoffs.Meanwhile, Pyotr Kochetkov made his debut in this postseason and stopped 14 of 15 shots. With a 27-16-3 record during the regular season, Kochetkov proved he could handle playoff intensity. His captain, Jordan Staal, praised Kochetkov for rising to the occasion, which enhanced team confidence in their goaltending depth.Also Read: With his stellar 2024-25 NHL season, Andrei Vasilevskiy secures a fifth Vezina Trophy finalist spot Undoubtedly, while little victory number four for the Hurricanes was celebrated, it became overshadowed by nothing but talk about the injury of Frederik Andersen.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Mark Cuban raises alarm over the rising physicality in the NBA playoffs



The 2025 NBA playoffs have delivered plenty of hard-hitting drama. With referees noticeably swallowing their whistles, the postseason has become far more physical compared to the 2024-25 regular season, sparking a fiery debate across the league. While many fans have embraced the throwback edge, Dallas Mavericks minority owner Mark Cuban isn't convinced it's a good thing for the NBA's long-term health.Mark Cuban is not entirely happy with the rising physical confrontation in the NBA playoffs. Cuban warned that the trend toward excessive physicality could create unintended consequences in the near future. Taking to X, the $5.7 billion rich mogul wrote, ""Wondering who will get into a fight next, which I believe is bad for the future of the NBA, will definitely draw more eyeballs."" While the aggressive style may entertain viewers, Cuban cautioned that if this continues unchecked, it could reshape the NBA in ways that diminish the game’s skill and finesse.""Here’s the thing,"" Cuban added. ""I guarantee you that no one at the top of the NBA made the decision that the games should be more physical. It’s the officials managing the games their way. Nothing changed in the rule book or case book. Right now every team still in is calling the NBA asking what the hell is going on.""Cuban, who sold a majority stake in the Mavericks but remains closely tied to the franchise, pointed out the NBA’s tendency to swing into extremes. ""The problem is that everything in the NBA always goes to excess. Guys will use physicality as a replacement for skill. Teams will adapt their rosters accordingly. If this stays in place for next [regular] season, I could see every team having a 2-way whose greatest ability is to fight and intimidate,"" he said.His comments came in reaction to a post by Fox Sports' Chris Broussard, who praised the return of gritty playoff basketball, noting how much more exciting it has been compared to the regular season. “I am not one that calls for a return to ‘90s basketball, but these NBA playoffs, where the refs are letting the teams play physical defense, are waaayyyy more entertaining than today’s matador-defense, easy-buckets regular season games. It’s night & day!” Broussard wrote on the platform.Cuban’s Mavericks, meanwhile, missed out on this gritty postseason after falling in the play-in tournament, a sharp contrast from their 2024 NBA Finals run led by Luka Doncic. Cuban, who has been a long-time enthusiast of the sport, has been vocal about the league’s decisions over the years. Arguably, the NBA is trying to restore viewership.Also Read: Paul George spotted back on the beach with wife Daniela Rajic after controversial snaps and NBA playoff disappointment The 2024-25 NBA regular season wrapped up with TNT, ESPN, and ABC averaging 1.53 million viewers — a slight 2% dip from last year’s 1.56 million, according to a recent report by Forbes. While regular season ratings have stayed relatively steady in recent years, this marks the league’s lowest average since the pandemic-affected 2021 season, which drew 1.39 million viewers. Including NBA TV’s lower-rated broadcasts, the overall average audience dropped to 1.04 million, reflecting a 5% decline compared to the 1.09 million average during the 2023-24 season.","Dallas Mavericks minority owner Mark Cuban is not happy with the rising physicality in the NBA playoffs.

WWE RAW this week saw new rivalries brewing up, exciting in-ring action, and the build-up to WWE's next Premium Live Event, Backlash, continued. WWE Monday Night RAW emanated from the T-Mobile Center in Kansas City, Missouri, this week. It saw the fallout from last week's show with new alliances cementing their place, jam-packed action in the ring, and new feuds heading into WWE Backlash 2025 .The trio opened the show to address their new alliance. Seth Rollins claimed that the future runs through him, with Paul Heyman and Bron Breakker by his side. They were interrupted by Sami Zayn, who came out to question Rollins' recent actions. Rollins was convinced that Zayn would not buy what they were selling, so he proposed trading him to SmackDown, getting him top opportunities, and asking for his answer by the end of the night.This was the opening contest of this week's Monday Night RAW. Both women went back and forth against each other in an exhilarating match, delivering captivating spots and moves inside the ring. However, the ending of the match was interrupted, as Giulia attacked Ripley with a chop block as she attempted to execute her finisher, the Riptide. The beatdown on Ripley continued until IYO Sky came out to make the save, and the duo worked together to neutralize the threat.Logan Paul came out to the ring and claimed that winning a World Championship was the only thing left for him to do in wrestling. He then challenged Jey Uso, leading to the YEET man coming out to confront him. A heated exchange of words happened, and the segment ended with Uso superkicking The Maverick.This was a tag team match set for the night, pitting Finn Balor and JD McDonagh against Erik and Ivar. It was an exciting display of tag team wrestling. Towards the end of the bout, Carlito tried to interfere on behalf of the Judgment Day, but Penta came out to stop him, leading to the War Raiders to hit the War Machine on JD McDonagh and pick up the win.Becky Lynch came out to the ring to address her heel turn. She revealed herself to be the one who attacked Bayley and claimed that it was payback for the countless attacks Bayley inflicted on her since 2019. Moreover, Lynch claimed that Lyra Valkyria would have never won the tag team titles with Bayley. Valkyria came out and revealed that everyone in the locker room warned her about Lynch, but she placed her hope in her. The segment ended in a heated exchange, and Valkyria challenged Lynch to a match at WWE Backlash for her WWE Women's Intercontinental Championship, which she accepted.This was a non-title match which saw a great performance by both women. Following an action-packed battle, Ivy Nile went for a running boot, but Stephanie Vaquer countered with a Dragon Screw and delivered a package backbreaker for the win.Pat McAfee stood up from the commentary desk to address Gunther's assault from last week. He stated that he stood up for his broadcast colleague, Michael Cole. GM in charge of the night, Nick Aldis, came out to hear him. McAfee stated that he was not happy with Gunther's suspension and wanted it to be lifted so that he could fight him. Aldis offered him a match against the Ring General at WWE Backlash, which he accepted.Seth Rollins and Sami Zayn were out first, as Zayn had to deliver an answer to Rollins' offer. The Visionary made it highly lucrative for him, including Paul Heyman offering him a straight No.1 contender spot for the Undisputed WWE Championship. However, Zayn made it clear that when he wins a World title, it will be because of him and not because of any favors. Zayn concluded by saying that while he and Rollins are friends, he could 'go to hell.' Bron Breakker came out for a match with Sami Zayn, which was relatively short, as the Wolf Dog laid a heinous beatdown on him, and Rollins asked him not to stop. The show ended with Breakker delivering multiple spears and Rollins hitting the Curb Stomp on him.Also read: Speculation grows around John Cena and Travis Scott’s potential WWE tag team match","WWE Monday Night RAW emanated from the T-Mobile Center in Kansas City, Missouri, this week.

Ye bola tha maarunga. But pata nahi tha aise maarega

[Has it ever happened that you hit a six on the very first ball?] - this was the innocent, yet striking, question young Vaibhav Suryavanshi posed to a teammate just days before making his IPL debut . Who would have thought that a youngster would probe such a question. Maybe it was an insight into the mind of the 14-year-old?The match was against the Lucknow Super Giants. One of India's finest bowlers, Avesh Khan, had the ball in hand. Yashasvi Jaiswal took the strike, nudged a single, and handed over the stage to Suryavanshi. What followed was straight out of a dream — the 14-year-old launched the very first ball of his IPL career for a six, announcing his arrival with a bang.Did he manifest it? Maybe. Was it a fluke? Possibly. But let’s move to another telling moment.It’s 10 am on Monday, April 28th. Suryavanshi wakes up and makes his first call — to his childhood coach Manish Ojha. After a few exchanges about footwork and technique, Suryavanshi confidently tells him, """" (Sir, today I will smash the bowlers).[Hit (the ball), but don’t lose your wicket. Play calmly, keep talking to Yashasvi],"" the coach said.In the evening, Suryavanshi padded up, left the dugout, exchanged a fist bump with Yashasvi — and the rest, as they say, is history.The young boy’s manifestation once again came true.The 14-year-old prodigy from Samastipur, Bihar, blazed his way to a sensational 38-ball 101, becoming the youngest centurion in IPL history at just 14 years and 32 days.In a breathtaking assault at a packed Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, Suryavanshi hammered 11 sixes and 7 fours, dismantling an attack featuring international stars like Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar, Rashid Khan and Karim Janat.While the crowd grew hoarse from endless cheering, Suryavanshi showed no signs of slowing down, making a mockery of some of the world’s best bowlers.The left-hander brought up his century off just 35 balls against Gujarat Titans , prompting a heartwarming moment — an injured Rahul Dravid , India’s ex-coach, rose from his wheelchair, fists pumping in celebration. Dravid cheered with uncontained joy, savouring the historic moment crafted by the young opener.[He had said he would hit it. But I didn’t know he would hit it like that]. I had an instinct that something big was going to happen, but honestly, I didn’t expect it to be this big. He is a God-gifted cricketer. He’s just a kid — only 14 years old. God has blessed him with immense talent. I am really thankful to God that I could play some part in his career,"" coach Ojha said.""He always says that Rajasthan Royals have given him a huge platform, and he is determined to work hard, play well, and give his best. His ultimate dream is to play for India. He is just 14. The great Sachin Tendulkar made his ODI debut at 16, and I am sure Vaibhav is on the right path. With a legend like Rahul Dravid guiding him, he doesn’t have to worry about anything,"" the coach said.","The 14-year-old prodigy from Samastipur, Bihar, blazed his way to a sensational 38-ball 101, becoming the youngest centurion in IPL history at just 14 years and 32 days.

Axar Patel-led Delhi Capitals (DC) will be aiming for an improved batting effort in the middle overs when they face Ajinkya Rahane's Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in their Indian Premier League (IPL) match at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Tuesday.Delhi Capitals have struggled with their top-order performance and batting against spinners at their home ground. Despite Abishek Porel showing good timing in the previous match, he couldn't convert it into a substantial score, while Faf du Plessis's return from injury was rusty and Karun Nair failed to make an impact.KKR, meanwhile, have managed just seven points so far and are placed seventh in the standings, having failed to collect any points from their last three matches, including two losses and a no-result.Rahane will be desperate to arrest the slide and keep their playoff hopes alive, with another defeat making the task tougher. Their batting lacks a settled look, with Quinton de Kock and Rahmanullah Gurbaz being rotated in the opening slot alongside Narine, while the side has relied heavily on Rahane and youngster Angkrish Raghuvanshi to score runs. Bowling has been another area of concern, with KKR failing to break opening stands, allowing teams to post big totals - as seen in the last game where PBKS added 120 for the opening wicket.The pitch which was used for RCB's match was two-paced. It will be interesting to see what will be in store for this fixture.

Poll Will KKR's batting improve against DC after their recent struggles? No, the problems will persist Yes, they will bounce back

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

After Delhi Capitals' loss to Royal Challengers Bengaluru on Sunday, mentor Kevin Pietersen said they had gone for a slow and low surface to counter their opponents' strength and held a similar strategy for the upcoming Kolkata Knight Riders on Tuesday.At the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Tuesday evening, the two teams will use the fifth pitch, which is in the centre, so there won't be a shorter side for the batters to target. And given how KKR have been batting this IPL season, they need a massive overhaul to make it count.KKR have scored the least amount of boundaries this IPL season (109) while their tally of sixes (61) is second worst. Only Chennai Super Kings have struck fewer maximums this season (49).They've scored 1245 runs this season - the lowest aggregate tally among the 10 franchises. Their average of 23.49 is the lowest. They've scored at 8.88 per over, the second worst. Again, CSK have fared poorer in comparison (8.06).Individually, there is a gulf between the top scorer Ajinkya Rahane (271 runs) and second-highest scorer Angkrish Raghuvanshi (197 runs) with Sunil Narine (151 runs) and Quinton de Kock (143 runs), Venkatesh Iyer (135 runs) all struggling to make a mark.The problems with the batting start right at the very top. Quinton de Kock and Sunil Narine have been the regular choice opening pair with exceptions made for Moeen Ali-De Kock once and twice for Narine-Rahmanullah Gurbaz, in the previous two matches.De Kock, who was missing from the KKR nets session on Monday, and Narine have only produced 109 runs in six matches this season. Their highest partnership has been a mere 46 runs, with runs coming at an average of 18.16 and run rate of 9.90.Only CSK (19.77) have a lower average at the top of the order this IPL season than KKR (19.87), and their upcoming opponents, DC (24.22).When probed about Andre Russell's under-utilisation about the franchise, Harshit Rana also mentioned the team's batting. ""This is cricket. It goes up and down. If you win two games in a row, If our batsmen [batters] perform well in two games, Then you will start saying that KKR's batting is long. So this keeps going on,"" he stated.KKR's attempts at helping their batting show will meet tough resistance from the opposite camp. On a sluggish pitch on Sunday, DC skipper Axar Patel picked up two wickets despite finding little support from others.Pacer Mitchell Starc, who went wicketless against RCB, will also be keen to make life difficult for his former team. Kuldeep Yadav will be a challenge to work around in the middle overs thanks to his deceptive googlies.Axar, Vipraj Nigam and Kuldeep could be the difference-makers for DC if KKR's track record this season is any indication. They've lost 21 wickets to spinners this season with the bowlers achieving a strike rate of 17.00 - best among the 10 teams.With batters not inspiring much confidence, the onus will be on the bowlers to push the team towards the finish line. Harshit Rana, Varun Chakaravarthy, Vaibhav Arora (11 wicket each) have been the pick of the bowlers while Narine has been a tidy customer with an economy rate of 7.75.With seven points so far in the season and 10 on offer in the remaining five matches, KKR still have a chance at qualifying for the playoffs. But after grabbing just one point in the last three matches, the Ajinkya Rahane-led franchise need to pull up their socks or prepare for an early exit. The road to that end begins against the Delhi Capitals.","KKR have scored the least amount of boundaries this IPL season (109) while their tally of sixes (61) is second worst.
