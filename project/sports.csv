There's not much difference between the way he practices and he plays the game. Because the intensity at which he wants to go to the match, he always replicates in the practice session,"" Dilip said in a video shared by BCCI.Dilip also discussed the standout catches from the first Test. One impressive catch came from KL Rahul . He took a catch in the slips, showing excellent anticipation and skill. ""KL Rahul's catch in the slip was a good one as he followed the ball and caught it behind his bodyline. It was a great example of following the ball properly,"" said Dilip.Yashashvi Jaiswal also made a remarkable catch. Dilip described it as one of the best ever.""It was one of the best you could have seen. Towards his non-dominant side, a really low, ball dipping in and he is running forward and the ball dipping fast.

When Mohinder Amarnath called BCCI selectors 'a bunch of jokers',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/when-mohinder-amarnath-called-bcci-selectors-a-bunch-of-jokers/articleshow/113627691.cms,"Mohinder Amarnath in November 1988. (TOI Photo)

NEW DELHI: Legendary cricketer and 1983 ODI World Cup hero Mohinder Amarnath , who turns 74 today (September 24), had once stirred a hornet's nest when he was dropped from the Indian cricket team.To say that the 1983 World Cup victory was a watershed moment for Indian cricket would be an understatement.It was on June 25, 1983 at Lord's that the Indian team, led by the flamboyant Kapil Dev stunned two-time defending World champions West Indies to perhaps change the game forever.Mohinder Amarnath played a pivotal role in India's maiden World Cup victory. He was the Man of the Match in both the semifinal and the final.In the semifinal against hosts England at Manchester on June 22, 1983, Amarnath took two wickets, before scoring 46 very crucial runs in the Indian run chase, as India won the match by 6 wickets.In the all-important final against West Indies on June 25, 1983 at Lord's, Amarnath scored 26 runs, the second highest score for India that day, as Kapil Dev's team was bowled out for a partly 183.But then Amarnath produced magic with the ball. His spell of 3/12 in 7 overs was crucial in bundling out the Windies for 140 runs, to pave the way for a historic 43-run victory that would change the face of Indian cricket forever.And Amarnath's famous 'Selectors are a bunch of jokers' statement and his tirade against former BCCI president Raj Singh Dungarpur , after he was dropped for the home Test series against New Zealand in 1988, is the stuff of legend. It was also a reflection of the man's principled nature.The tension between Amarnath and Dungarpur, a prominent Indian cricket administrator and selector, was a significant episode in Indian cricket during the late 1980s.It stemmed from Amarnath's public criticism of the selection process and his strong personality, which often clashed with Dungarpur's authority.Dungarpur, who served as the chairman of selectors during that period, was seen as a key figure in Amarnath's controversial exclusion from the Indian cricket team.Despite Amarnath being in good form and playing crucial roles in India's success (notably the 1983 World Cup victory), he was frequently dropped from the team. This led to frustration and a sense of injustice for Amarnath , who believed that politics and favoritism were involved in the decision-making process.In response to his repeated exclusions, Amarnath publicly called the selection committee a ""bunch of jokers,"" which was widely seen as directed at Dungarpur and other selectors.Dungarpur, being a powerful figure in Indian cricket, did not take kindly to Amarnath's outburst, and the relationship between the two deteriorated further.While Dungarpur was respected for his contributions to Indian cricket administration, including his role in nurturing young talent, Amarnath's criticism highlighted the murky nature of selections during that era.The clash between the two became symbolic of the larger issues of transparency and politics within Indian cricket at the time.Amarnath's outspoken nature made headlines, and his remark resonated with many cricket fans who were also frustrated with the inconsistent policies of team selection.Despite the controversy, Amarnath remained a respected figure in Indian cricket due to his outstanding performances on the field, particularly during India's 1983 World Cup win.Son of Lala Amarnath , the first post-independence captain of India, Mohinder Amarnath is commonly known as 'Jimmy'. He is also known as the comeback man of Indian cricket and was noted for his personality, courage and determination.Amarnath played 69 Tests scoring 4,378 runs with 11 hundreds and 24 fifties and also claimed 32 wickets. He also played 85 ODIs for India.",Mohinder Amarnath played a pivotal role in India's maiden World Cup victory. He was the Man of the Match in both the semifinal and the final.

KL Rahul's Test cricket returns continue to confound,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/kl-rahuls-test-cricket-returns-continue-to-confound/articleshow/113649585.cms,"Versatility has been KL Rahul's calling card to stay relevant.

The talented & versatile batter has some sublime hundreds to his name but has not been as prolific as would have been expected, in spite of being backed by successive captain-coach combinations. If he regains his confidence,

could be an asset Down Under...

Who is the only Indian opener to score Test hundreds in England, South Africa, and Australia? KL Rahul Who is the only visiting batter to score two Test hundreds at Supersport Park, Centurion, often considered a graveyard for non-South African batters? KL Rahul.Who is the only Indian batter to score seven successive Test 50s? KL Rahul.Who is the only Indian batter who prompted MS Dhoni - a man not known to be philanthropic while praising younger players - to say before an ODI in Ranchi, ""I think India have found an all-format opener""? KL Rahul.And yet, when we see the career stats of a man who is one among only 22 specialist batters to have played 50 or more Tests for India, it feels like Rahul's potential has had a rocky marriage with performance. A sub35 average for someone who has played 51 Tests makes Rahul fans - and there are many - grumble in disbelief.""Confused approach"", ""over-thinking"", ""scoreboard inertia"", ""batting-order changes"", ""looked at only as injury back-up"", ""ruthless and incessant trolling"" - these have been just some phrases used to justify the modest figures. Looking for words resembling ""lack of opportunity"" and ""misfortune""? Keep looking.On the contrary, Rahul has caught quite a few lucky breaks. Like the one in England in 2021, when he found himself opening the innings after Shubman Gill and Mayank Agarwal, both designated partners for Rohit at the top of the order, picked up injuries. Rahul was slotted in as opener. A gritty match-winning hundred followed at Lord's.The solid 76 in Nottingham in the previous Test was a promising appetizer.Fortune smiled on him in the Asia Cup 2023 too in Sri Lanka, when just before the toss against Pakistan, Shreyas Iyer picked up a back injury and Rahul got in as a 'keeper batter and smashed a brilliant hundred. He enjoyed a productive ODI World Cup in that role, keeping Ishan Kishan out.Being articulate and having led astutely in franchise cricket, Rahul was looked at as a worthy deputy to both Kohli and Rohit. Their injury-led absences saw him become India's 34th Test captain in Johannesburg in Jan 2022 and later in the year in Bangladesh for two Tests.However, while the 'C' next to his name elevated his profile, Rahul's form nosedived. He averaged only 17.12 in four Tests in 2022. He lost his place in the T20 side after a below par T20 World Cup Down Under, in which it seemed he started to bat conservatively.Yet, he has repeatedly found backing both in the Kohli-Shastri regime and the Dravid-Rohit regime. He found support from Rohit again in Chennai, where he was preferred over Sarfaraz Khan , who had impressed in the three outings against England earlier in the year and whose game against spin is flawless.""The kind of message that has been given to him from our side was very simple: we wanted him to play all games. We want him to bring the best out of him. And it is our duty as well to bring the best out of him,"" Rohit stressed.As captain, Rohit has earned the reputation of giving players the freedom, comfort and security. The vote of confidence for Rahul illustrated that. Rohit also acknowledged Rahul's ton in the Centurion Test in difficult conditions batting at No. 6, and also the 86 batting at No. 4 in Hyderabad against England before getting injured.""He's got the game to play spin and seam. I don't see any reason why he can't flourish in Test cricket. Obviously, the opportunities are there now. It's for him to understand how he wants to take his career forward,"" Rohit stated.The team think-tank knows that a confident Rahul in Australia will be an asset as a backup 'keeper to Rishabh Pant , allowing the selectors to pick another bowler or batter in the travelling squad. He was safe as a church with the 'keeping gloves on the pace-friendly surfaces in South Africa.Versatility has been Rahul's calling card to stay relevant. An opener, he effortlessly embraced the role of keeper and middle-order enforcer-cum innings builder in ODIs and played notable knocks like the 97 not out vs Australia in Chennai in the ODI World Cup opener to rescue India from 2-3, chasing 200.But his knock of 66 off 107 balls in the final against the same opponents in Ahmedabad gave enough ammunition to the troll army to attack him again.Having the comfort of Ravindra Jadeja and R Ashwin to bat behind him - and being sandwiched between them and the flamboyant Rishabh Pant at No. 5 - could give Rahul enough confidence to make a name for himself at No. 6.For inspiration, he can look at how VVS Laxman prospered at that number. Another option: Watch his own knock on Boxing Day in 2023 in Centurion.","KL Rahul is one of only 22 specialist batters to have played 50 or more Tests for India.

Pakistan's next assignment is the Test series at home against England, but as per claims made by country's former batsman Basit Ali , the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is working overtime to ensure the team does well in ICC Champions Trophy that the country is set to host in February-March next year.Talking about a meeting before the one that was held to pick the squad for the first Test against England, Basit made serious claims, alleging that white-ball coach and former South Africa batsman Gary Kirsten is now part of the politics in Pakistan cricket.""Pehle dosti yaari group ka jo head tha ab woh change ho gaya hai.

""Being a head, he (Naqvi) has to support, which is a good thing.""Par mai isse saazishi-tola bolunga (but I will call this a colluding group), be it the PCB establishment.""He also slammed the team for its embarrassing Test series whitewash at home against Bangladesh, who not only registered their first ever Test win over Pakistan but also went on to sweep the two-match series 2-0.""Mai to saaf bolta hu.

3rd ODI: England end Australia's winning streak with Harry Brook show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/3rd-odi-england-end-australias-winning-streak-with-harry-brook-show/articleshow/113648414.cms,"Harry Brook (Reuters Photo)

In a thrilling encounter at Chester-le-Street on Tuesday, England' captain Harry Brook led his team to a 46-run victory against the world champions Australia, keeping their hopes alive in the five-match ODI series.Despite a shaky start, losing openers Phil Salt and Ben Duckett to Mitchell Starc's bowling, England fought back through a remarkable 156-run partnership between Will Jacks (84) and Brook (110 not out) in a rain-hit chase after Australia put up an impressive 304 for 7 on the board.Rain interrupted play with England at 254 for 4 off 37.4 overs, but they were comfortably ahead of the required target under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method, securing the victory and ending Australia's 14-match winning streak in ODIs.Earlier in the day, Alex Carey's unbeaten 77 and Steven Smith's 60 led the visitors' batting card. England paceman Jofra Archer claimed 2 for 67. Despite losing wickets at crucial moments, Australia's middle-order partnerships, particularly between Carey and Glenn Maxwell (30), and later with Aaron Hardie (44), helped them reach a challenging total.England's bowlers made early inroads, but Smith's half-century and Carey's aggressive batting kept Australia in the game.Cameron Green, who replaced the injured Travis Head, was dismissed for 42. In the following over, Australia's score of 131 for 3 quickly became 132 for 4 when Labuschagne fell for a duck, mistiming a paddle-sweep off spinner Jacks that was easily caught by wicketkeeper Jamie Smith.Smith reached his half-century by pulling a short ball from Jacks for his fifth boundary, having faced 71 deliveries. However, he was dismissed when Brydon Carse made a spectacular diving catch on the boundary off a forceful pull shot from Archer.Carey, on the other hand, struck Carse through midwicket for one of his four boundaries in a 48-ball fifty that also included a straight six off Jacob Bethell.The series, now standing at 2-1 in Australia's favour, will continue at Lord's on Friday, with both teams eager to secure a victory in the remaining two matches.Initially in the home team's run-chase, their supporters might have been concerned when Salt clipped Starc's delivery straight to midwicket, and Duckett, attempting to play across the line, edged the left-arm fast bowler to backward point.However, Jacks and Brook managed to turn the game around against an Australian bowling attack that was missing their key leg-spinner, Adam Zampa, due to illness.Jacks, made a fourth fifty in 10 ODIs but missed out on a maiden century when he uppercut a bouncer from Cameron Green to backward point to end an 82-ball innings featuring nine fours and a six.Jamie Smith's hook shot off a Green found the deep square leg fielder, leaving England at 197 for 4 in the 32nd over.An edgy four to fine third-man brought up Brooks' maiden ODI century in his 18th match, scored off 87 deliveries with 12 fours and two sixes. His second fifty came off just 33 balls.","England beat Australia by 46 runs in their fifth ODI at Chester-le-Street. Alex Carey's unbeaten 77 and Steven Smith's 60 led the visitors' batting card.

A Classy Root Hundred & Willey Fireworks! | Classic ODI | Eng v India 2018 | Lord's

NEW DELHI: Whenever India competes in any international match, there's always excitement and enthusiasm among players and fans. Cricketers put their bodies on the line to save every run or take an extra single. Whether it’s facing a yorker delivery above 140 km/h or pulling a short ball in front of their eyes, cricketers tend to give their best for their country when wearing their national colours.Since Virat Kohli took on the role of captaincy, he introduced a new culture in the Test team.The team no longer wanted to play for a draw; the focus was always on winning the match. This mindset was strongly supported by Ravi Shastri , the head coach at the time. However, in one particular match, this approach was not seen in a moment when MS Dhoni scored his 10,000th ODI run.It was the second ODI match of India tour of England in 2018. England batted first, Joe Root scored a century and led the team total to 322/7.At Lord's , one of the most iconic grounds and the home of English cricket, MS Dhoni reached this significant milestone. The moment was met with a muted response, even from his own team's dressing room, which seemed unusually sombre.When Dhoni arrived at the crease following Virat Kohli's wicket, India needed 183 runs from 23 overs, with the required run rate just shy of eight per over. However, during Dhoni's 20-over stay at the crease, which ended with his dismissal for 37 off 59 balls, India only managed to add 75 runs, resulting in the required rate nearly doubling.India struggled to score more than 10 runs in a single over during the last 15 overs, with overs 40 to 50 yielding a paltry 42 runs. Furthermore, it was the first time since the2011 World Cup semi-final that India failed to hit a six in an ODI match.Shortly after, Dhoni faced boos as India's run rate nearly ground to a halt in the final 10 overs, following the collapse of the chase for 323 runs.This incident left the head coach enraged, as it did not align with the team culture he aimed to cultivate.As per the autobiography of former fielding coach R Sridhar, titled 'Coaching Beyond: My Days with the Indian Cricket Team,' Shastri was furious with Dhoni's approach after his lackluster performance during the chase.The coach's frustration stemmed not so much from the defeat or the margin, but rather from his clear stance that Dhoni needed to accelerate the innings in response to the situation at hand.Sridhar wrote, “Uncharacteristically, he (Dhoni) shut shop, and even though our required rate in the last 10 was nearly 13 an over, we only managed some 20 runs in the next six overs. That was the innings when MS got to 10,000 ODI runs , a very significant milestone. We were all thrilled for him, but we also wanted to know why he hadn’t made even a token attempt at the target.”Ravi Shastri expressed his frustration during the team meeting ahead of the decisive final ODI. Though he did not name anyone, his words were directed at a senior batter as he maintained eye contact throughout and warned, “No matter who you may be, there should not be another occasion when we lose a match not trying to win it. It will not happen under my watch. And if anyone does it, that will be the last bloody game of cricket they will play under my watch. You can lose a cricket game, no shame in that, but you will not lose like this,” Shastri further added.In reply, Dhoni, doing justice to his reputation, remained calm and digested all. Sridhar explained in detail, “MS was sitting right there in the front, and while Ravi’s words were meant for the team, his eyes were trained on MS. To the former skipper’s great credit, he didn’t flinch, he never broke eye contact with Ravi. He didn’t look here and there or fidget because one of his many admirable qualities is his ability to take the knocks, especially when he knows in his heart of hearts that he deserves them.”","MS Dhoni faced boos as India's run rate nearly ground to a halt in the final 10 overs, following the collapse of the chase for 323 runs.

found out the hard way

Will Kuldeep get a go?

CHENNAI: They are 17 going on 18, and the sound of music in the India camp is getting sweeter by the day.Barring Virat Kohli , R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja , none of the Indian players in the current set-up know what it is to lose a Test series at home.India have won 17 consecutive series since the loss to England in 2012, a phenomenal record.Even the opposition teams know they are virtually fighting a losing battle.In every conversation that the Bangladeshi players or support-staff had with the media over the last few days, the refrain was: ""Yes, we won in Pakistan, but Team India is a different kettle of fish.""Rohit wants to seal the World Test Championship Final berth before they leave for Australia and the first hurdle has been cleared with a resounding 280-run win against Bangladesh at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Sunday.Not just the margin of victory, it's the aura of this team playing at home that is quite incredible. It seems as if they want to increase the degree of difficulty themselves so that the team can be tested before the Australia series.In Chennai, they chose not to play on their favoured black-soil pitch despite having the best spin troika in the world. A red-soil pitch with decent bounce seemed good preparation for Australia and after being reduced to 144/6, the batting prowess of the two bowling allrounders Ashwin and Jadeja once again underlined India's depth.Virtually every box was ticked in Chennai barring two back-to-back low scores by the two superstars of Indian batting - Virat Kohli and Rohit. But all the others got runs and the five bowlers did what was expected of them.""It was a great result, looking at what lies ahead. We were playing after a while but were in touch with the game. It was important that we work as a group and that's what happened here as we got the win,"" Rohit said.There's hardly a grey area to worry about and it will be interesting to see what India's gameplan is for the Kanpur Test starting on Friday. There's a theory that Jasprit Bumrah shouldn't be overworked before Australia, but he has bowled only 21 overs in the first Test and there's no reason to rest him in Kanpur.If it is a black-soil pitch at the Green Park, there is a possibility that left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav will get a go. He was in magnificent form in the last Test series against England at home and can be a genuine wicket-taking option in Australia. If there's a chance of the ball turning a bit, the spinner should an ideal candidate in place of Akash Deep.Not that there's any reason to drop the Bengal pacer. He got two important wickets in the first innings and looked good with the new ball but the Indian team management should look to keep Kuldeep's morale high.","India have won 17 consecutive series since the loss to England in 2012.

Kohli, turning 36 in November, and Rohit, who turned 37 in April, have retired from T20Is after their successful T20 World Cup campaign but remain active in other formats.Kapil shared his views on MyKhel, saying, ""In my opinion, the period between 26 and 34 years is your prime and thereafter the fitness of the players will ensure their longevity.""Kapil himself retired at 35 after an illustrious career, playing 131 Tests and 225 ODIs. He bagged 434 and 253 wickets in each format, respectively. He also had notable batting stats with 5248 runs in Tests and 3783 in ODIs.However, Kapil emphasized that retirement is a personal choice. He feels that as long as players maintain their fitness and enjoy the game, they should continue.He noted, "" Ravi Shastri retired at a very early age while Sachin Tendulkar had a longer stint.

Star off-spinner

gives insights into working style of India's coaches

NEW DELHI: It was in 2015 that Indian cricket last saw a foreigner as the head coach of the men's team. Zimbabwean Duncan Fletcher was at the helm of affairs till the 2015 ODI World Cup before his contract wasn't renewed. Since then, the Indian team has got four full-time head coaches - Ravi Shastri Rahul Dravid and now Gautam Gambhir Sanjay Bangar and VVS Laxman chipped in on an interim basis when required.Dravid was in charge from Nov 2021 till the recent T20 World Cup triumph. Gambhir has taken over since then. Star off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has been a member of the team since the Duncan Fletcher days and has seen the functioning style of all four Indian coaches from close quarters.Speaking about the current head coach and his predecessor, Ashwin gave Gambhir the moniker of ""relaxed rancho"", while terming Dravid to have a ""regimented"" style of functioning. Contrary to Gambhir's perceived fiery persona, Ashwin said the former India opener is quite laid-back.""I think he (Gambhir) is very relaxed. I want to call him 'relaxed rancho'. There's no pressure at all. In the morning, there will be a team huddle. He is very relaxed about that as well. He will be like, 'Are you coming, please come'; it's like that with him,"" Ashwin said on his YouTube channel.Highlighting the difference between Gambhir and Dravid's coaching styles, Ashwin said, ""With Rahul bhai, as soon as we come, he demanded everything to be in order. Even a bottle should be kept at a particular place at a particular time. He is very regimented.""Ashwin said Gambhir, in comparison, is quite the opposite. ""With Gambhir, he doesn't expect all that. He has a relaxed order and will be a people's man. He will capture everybody's heart, and I think he will be loved by the boys,"" the off-spinner said.When Shastri was India's head coach, his working style was more like a ""big brother"". Ashwin had earlier highlighted how Shastri arranged for a karaoke night and sang Hindi songs to lift the mood in the camp when the team was bowled out for 36 in Adelaide.""We were not even thinking about a series win because we were just bowled out for 36. The mood in the dressing room was down. Ravi bhai, like a big brother, organised a team dinner. He arranged for a karaoke night; he himself started singing. He sang old Hindi songs. Everybody joined in,"" Ashwin said. ""We didn't think of the series, we kept small targets, and we took each match individually after that.""In the past, Ashwin has spoken highly about Kumble. ""There is a saying that whenever you come too close to a celebrity, you get disappointed, but not with respect to Anil bhai,"" Ashwin had said.","Ravichandran Ashwin gives insights into working style of India's coaches.

NEW DELHI: Veteran Australian spinner Nathan Lyon believes there is very little margin for error when bowling to Rishabh Pant Lyon noted that Pant possesses an extraordinary amount of talent capable of challenging the best bowlers in the world.Pant will be a crucial component of the Indian batting line-up during the upcoming five-Test Border-Gavaskar series starting in Perth on November 22.The 26-year-old Pant recently returned to Test cricket after a hiatus of nearly 21 months, following a near-fatal car crash in December 2022.

So, you've got to be good.

This includes a century and two half-centuries, with a top score of 159 not out.The wicketkeeper-batter scored an unbeaten 89 in the second innings of the Brisbane Test in 2021, leading India to a historic victory. This marked Australia's first Test loss at the venue in 32 years, resulting in India sealing the series 2-1 and retaining the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Lyon mentioned that his strategy would involve pushing Pant on the back foot to provoke mistakes.""I'm not afraid of getting hit for a six. The challenge is that I can provide the batters and try and keep someone like Rishabh in his crease and potentially try and get him to defend me a lot more... and, hopefully, bring a couple of chances along the way.""","Nathan Lyon believes there is very little margin for error when bowling to Rishabh Pant.

NEW DELHI: The New Zealand cricket team faces a formidable challenge on their upcoming Test tour of India.Former Black Caps opener Martin Guptill believes that the most difficult part for the Kiwi batters will be handling the turning ball, especially the occasional delivery that skids through.India and New Zealand, finalists of the inaugural World Test Championship (2019-21 cycle), are set to compete in three Tests in Bengaluru, Pune, and Mumbai starting on October 16.""You feel like you can never score sometimes, that's the hardest thing about coming here to India. The ball's turning square, then the same sort of ball comes through and it skids on straight.""You never know which one's going to turn and which one's going to go straight, so you have to always be thinking, you have to always be mentally on song and on (the top of) your game,"" Guptill told PTI in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of Legends League Cricket.Guptill emphasized the need to leverage any advantage against India, who have an impressive streak of winning their last 17 series at home.""To try and get on top of India is extremely difficult. But when you feel like you are, you have to try and take that as long as possible in the game,"" he said.""It's a tough place to play. It's hot, sweaty and you feel like everything's against you. But as I said, if you can get try and get on top of them and you feel like you are getting on top of them, you've got to try and go as deep as possible in the game,"" added the former opener.On the subject of India's threats, Guptill finds it challenging to decide between Ravichandran Ashwin and Jasprit Bumrah as the Kiwis’ biggest threat.""Both of them. I mean, you can't take away (the fact) that (Ravindra) Jadeja scored 86, 89 or something, wasn't it?""(They had a) 199 run partnership, you think you've got India against the ropes and then you've got these two come out and bat.""Jadeja and Ashwin had a crucial 199-run stand in the opening Test against Bangladesh in Chennai, rescuing India from a precarious position of 144 for six on the first day, effectively taking the game away from Bangladesh.""While Jadeja is probably the better batter, I mean, Ashwin goes about his work in a completely different way and is very effective in the way he scores his runs,"" he said.""So you never feel like you're on top of India because they've got such depth, and then, obviously, you've got them as a partnership of the ball as well,"" he said.Guptill praised young Kiwi pacer Will O Rourke for his extra pace, which troubled Sri Lankan batsmen, taking eight wickets in the Galle Test. He believes the extra pace was something missing from their current seam attack.""I first faced him maybe three years ago and I was really, really impressed in how he bowled. For him to have developed further in the last couple of years and get his chance in Test cricket, man, he's had a really good start,"" he said.""He's got a little bit of extra pace behind him, which some of our bowlers don't have and he's got a bit of height, which gives him that little bit of extra bounce, which on our wickets at home helps a lot more than maybe what it does here in the subcontinent,"" Guptill added.Acknowledging the inevitable changes in New Zealand's Test side, Guptill said it remains to be seen if the younger generation can fill the void left by experienced players like Kane Williamson.""Only time will tell. I can't comment on that at the moment. I mean, you don't know until these new guys come through and start playing whether they're up to it or not,"" he said.""Once Kane and the likes have finished playing and when these new guys come in, it's going to take time for them I guess,"" he said.",Martin Guptill says New Zealand must be on top of their game against India.

NEW DELHI: Harmanpreet Kaur has often faced the sting of near misses in major tournaments. But the Indian captain feels confident that her team has fully prepared for the upcoming Women's T20 World Cup , starting in the UAE on October 3.Since the tournament's inception in 2009, India has made it to the final only once, in 2020, when they were defeated by Australia. The team also reached the WODI World Cup final in 2017.Harmanpreet was part of both teams and led the squad in the 2020 T20 World Cup.""This is the best team we are going forward with. The players have been playing together for a long time.

They know if there is one team that can beat them it is us,"" said Harmanpreet.Head coach Amol Muzumdar elaborated on the focus areas during their training camp in Bengaluru.""We did identify a few things (after the loss to Sri Lanka) and we went about in the subsequent camp. We first had a fitness and fielding camp. Then we had a 10-day skills-only camp. We brought in a sports psychologist also (Mughda Bawre). She has been fantastic with the group.""""We focused on enhancing athletic ability, all-round fielding abilities, there were yoga sessions and psychological sessions were added,"" he continued.Regarding the lack of recent game time, Muzumdar remains positive. ""We are prepared for everything. In the skills camp, we had nets and five games in 10 days' time. We have ticked all the boxes as far as preparation is concerned,"" he said.He also expressed confidence in the batting lineup, which, while not as aggressive as those of Australia or England, has its strengths.""Our top six are the best. Their styles and mannerisms are different. Number three we have identified but we will reveal that when eleven is announced. In T20s, number three sets the game up, in any form actually.""""As far as the conditions are concerned, it will be similar to India. Start of the season they could be extra bounce especially in Dubai but climate will be just like India.""The event was relocated to the UAE from Bangladesh due to unrest in the South Asian nation.Chief selector Neetu David added, ""We have done what is the best for the team.

MUMBAI: Ishan Kishan ’s resurgence in red-ball cricket is gathering steam. On Monday, the national selectors picked the wicketkeeper-batsman, who hasn’t played for India since returning from India’s tour of South Africa in December last year, in the Rest of India squad for the Irani Cup clash against Ranji Trophy champions Mumbai at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow from October 1–5.In February this year, Kishan had lost his BCCI contract due to failure to turn up for Ranji Trophy matches for Jharkhand. However, the left-hander cracked a hundred for Jharkhand in the Buchi Babu Tournament and two weeks ago, followed that up with a counter-attacking century in his comeback first-class match in the Duleep Trophy. It helped him pip Sanju Samson, who too scored a ton in the Duleep Trophy.Apart from Kishan, the other wicketkeeper in the ROI squad is Dhruv Jurel, who has been picked subject to India not picking him for the second Test in Kanpur from September 27 to October 1. Another man continuing his red ball resurgence is Karnataka pacer Prasidh Krishna, who impressed in the Duleep Trophy while bowling for India A, helping them win the title with his three wickets.One man who can consider himself unlucky to have been ignored from the ROI squad is Haryana leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, who picked 18 wickets for Northamptonshire in the English County Championship recently, with the selectors preferring to pick leggie Rahul Chahar instead.Meanwhile, showing yet again that it has begun prioritizing participation in domestic cricket now, the BCCI on Monday announced that it will release batsman Sarfaraz Khan, Jurel and left-arm pacer Yash Dayal from the squad for the Kanpur Test, subject to them not being selected in the XI, to enable the trio to play in the Irani Cup tie, which will be played in nearby Lucknow around almost the same time.""Dhruv Jurel and Yash Dayal have been selected in the Rest of India squad and their participation is subject to them not being involved in the second Test match against Bangladesh in Kanpur.

Like Ayush, Juned Khan too played for Mumbai's second-strong team in Bangalore.""Both Ayush and Juned come from extremely humble backgrounds. Juned has been a net bowler for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the recent past. He has done well for PJ Hindu Gymkhana in local cricket.

The Haryana Police DSP who played a pivotal role in guiding India to their historic 2007 ICC T20 World Cup triumph is Joginder Sharma His name got etched in Indian cricket folklore when he bowled the final over in the nerve-wracking final against Pakistan , sealing India’s victory.However, many may not know that Joginder was soon appointed as Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) with the Haryana Police, for his meritorious achievements in the field of sports.Joginder’s moment of glory came in the high-pressure final at Johannesburg when captain MS Dhoni threw him the ball to bowl the final over with Pakistan needing 13 runs to win with one-wicket in hand.Despite his relative inexperience at the international level, Joginder showed immense composure and bravery in that moment.After conceding a six to Pakistan's Misbah-ul-Haq , Joginder delivered the ball that led to Misbah’s famous attempted scoop shot, which was caught by Sreesanth at short fine leg.India clinched the inaugural T20 World Cup, and Joginder became an overnight hero.Before the iconic moment, Joginder had a brief ODI stint but a steady domestic career, representing Haryana in first-class cricket. His all-round abilities with both bat and ball made him a useful addition in the Indian squad for the T20 World Cup.However, it was his mental strength that helped him rise to the occasion during the high-pressure moments of the tournament.Post his cricketing career, Joginder joined the Haryana Police and was appointed to the rank of DSP. His contribution to Indian cricket, particularly the unforgettable final over, remains a proud chapter in India’s sporting history.Incidentally, India won the inaugural T20 World Cup title 17 years ago on this day in 2007.","Joginder Sharma bowled the final over in the nerve-wracking final against Pakistan.

KOLKATA: “Sometimes, football is unfair,” were the very first words of NorthEast United FC head coach Juan Pedro Benali as he began addressing the media after their 3-2 loss to Mohun Bagan Super Giants in Kolkata on Monday.While there was no dearth of appreciation from the NorthEast United fans at the Salt Lake Stadium, or those following it from elsewhere, for the show put up by their players despite the defeat to their glorified opponents, it was the second goal by Mohun Bagan captain Subhasish Bose that dominated the chatter on social media.With the score reading 2-1 in the visitors’ favour, it was a fumble from NEUFC custodian Gurmeet Singh in collecting a header by Tom Aldred in the 61st minute that helped Bose in putting the ball into the net and giving the hosts the crucial equaliser.Replays showed the Bagan skipper’s shoes stamping on Gurmeet’s left arm to get the ball in even as the goalkeeper was still holding the ball, albeit unconvincingly, leading some critics and NEUFC coach to feel that the goal needed to be disallowed.“You only need to see the arm of the goalkeeper, Gurmeet, in blood. That’s enough!” Benali said at the press conference on Monday. “You can play against 11 players but not against the elements. And sometimes it’s the small details that are the game changers.”While Bose’s equaliser dominated most of the interaction, Benali was also quick to acknowledge his team’s efforts on the field that made the Shield winners work hard for their first win of the season.“But I am really happy and proud of my players because they showed that we are growing. We made silly mistakes, but we are growing. We went head-to-head against Mohun Bagan in this stadium and with a crowd like this,” said the Spaniard.Last season’s top scorer for the Highlanders, Mohammed Ali Bemammer and star of their Durand Cup final against the same opponents, Alaeddine Ajaraie, were both on the scoresheet on Monday as the likes of Jithin MS kept the expensive Bagan defence on their toes. And the Michel Zabaco-led NEUFC will be eager to get the full points and their second win of season when they play their season’s first home game against Kerala Blasters next week.For now, Benali, who believes ‘the fair result would be a 2-2 draw’, is ready to move on in quest for a memorable season.“Today, we feel our scratches from the previous game and tomorrow we’ll start thinking about Kerala,” said Benali while signing off by reiterating, “Football is unfair and today (Monday) it was unfair on the NorthEast.”",NorthEast United FC lost 3-2 to Mohun Bagan Super Giants in Kolkata on Monday.

Scent of revenge as Mohun Bagan down NorthEast United in 5-goal thriller,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/scent-of-revenge-as-mohun-bagan-down-northeast-united-in-5-goal-thriller/articleshow/113618217.cms,"KOLKATA: From Mohun Bagan SG 's perspective, it might be a revenge served in the rain.A little over three weeks after losing the Durand Cup final to NorthEast United FC , Mohun Bagan SG got even with the Highlanders 3-2 in their Indian Super League clash at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday.Juan Pedro Benali 's NorthEast raced to a 2-1 lead inside the opening half an hour when their Moroccan recruits Alaaeddine Ajaraie (5) and Mohammed Bemammer (24) rattled the Bagan defence.Although Jose Molina 's hosts found in young defender Dipendu Biswas an unlikely scorer to bring things on level terms briefly in the 10th minute, NEUFC were the better side, giving some hard evidence that their triumph over the green-and-maroon brigade in the Durand Cup final last month was not a fluke.But when the second half started amid heavy downpour, Bagan changed the complexion of the game in a spectacular manner, pouring cold water on the visitors' aspirations. Full-back Subhasish Bose swooped on an opportunity to make it 2-2 in the 61st minute and Jason Cummings, who replaced Manvir Singh on the hour mark, completed the turnaround, delivering the killer punch with a sumptuous strike in the 87th minute.The match had all the ingredients of being a classic: Brilliant goals, superb counter-attack and a remarkable fightback. Molina even handed Jamie Maclaren his much-anticipated debut 10 minutes before the winning goal. But as far as Bagan's fightback was concerned, it started with Greg Stewart's corner and ended with NEUFC goalkeeper Gurmeet Singh failing to hold on to a headed pass towards his goal from Bagan defender Tom Alfred and letting the ball slip out of his hands. After Dimitri Petratos missed his chance, Subhasish was on hand to push it in.NEUFC players cried for a foul on their goalkeeper but referee Jamal Mohamed remained unmoved.The game got off to a boisterous start with both teams eager to play with an extra degree of intensity. It was the visitors who fired the early warning shot when Ajaraie hit the post in the second minute following a Jithin cross from the other end.When Ajaraie came calling again three minutes later, the Bagan defence failed to stop the inevitable. Unable to make room for lining up his shot in the face of twin challenge from Asish Rai and Apuia, Ajaraie coolly delivered the ball for his countrymate Bemammer to meet it with a sweetly-timed volley with the outstep of his boot, the ball swerving inwards and settling into the net giving Kaith no chance to react.Bagan reacted immediately. Petratos whipped in a free-kick towards the box and Dipendu rose to the occasion, brilliantly placing his header into the far corner of the box.But NorthEast United regained the lead through a wonderful counter-attacking goal. The moment Bagan lost the ball in the rival box, Jithin injected a whole new meaning in it, launching into a quickfire countermove that scythed through the Bagan defence, which was still retreating to take shape in transition. Playing a diagonal 1-2 with Ajaraie, Jithin sent the ball again across the edge of the box and his Moroccan teammate came up with a brilliant left-footed finish, drilling it in past a diving Kaith.A torrential rain welcomed the players back to the field after the break and this was where NEUFC lost the plot and Bagan turned it in their favour.NEUFC custodian presented an opportunity and Subhasish swooped on it to make it 2-2. Then, a minute after Maclaren failed to cash in on another bloomer by Gurmeet, when he failed to clear a danger properly after coming out of his box, Cummings came to the fore, meeting another substitute Sahal Abdul Samad's lay-off with a powerful strike from inside the box, sending the rain-bathed crowd into rapture.",Mohun Bagan SG beat NorthEast United FC 3-2 in their Indian Super League clash at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. Bagan lost the Durand Cup final to the Highlanders three weeks ago. NorthEast raced to a 2-1 lead inside the opening half an hour when their Moroccan recruits Alaaeddine Ajaraie and Mohammed Bemammer rattled the Bagan defence.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113618181,imgsize-176116,width-400,resizemode-4/113618181.jpg"

His four red cards reflect his fearless, sometimes reckless, defending style that made him both a hero and a villain on the pitch.Zlatan Ibrahimovic, a striker with flair and confidence, earned a reputation not only for his stunning goals but also for his fiery temperament. The Swede's confrontational nature on the field saw him receive four red cards in the Champions League, showcasing that his passion sometimes boiled over into clashes with referees and opponents alike.Nicknamed ""The Pitbull,"" Edgar Davids was renowned for his aggressive, combative style of play in midfield.

If you win, you will get this much as a bonus, and if the team wins this much extra.""The committee then decided to authorize the captain to discuss it with the player.""Rajpal refused to comment on the matter but another member of the executive committee who attended the meeting confirmed, without revealing details, that Nagal's request was agreed to.An AITA source familiar with the subject said, ""It ($50,000) is roughly Rs. 40-45 lakh for two ties in a year. So essentially, he has asked for Rs. 20 lakh per tie, which I think is fine. A (No. 1) player gets anywhere around Rs. 7 to 12 lakhs at the moment.""As a standalone figure it might seem exorbitant, but to put it in perspective, a player earned $100,000 simply for turning up in the singles first round at the US Open this year. At the French Open, a first-round appearance made a player richer by 73,000-euros.It is also understood that Nagal had requested for a change in support staff attached to the Indian Davis Cup team. It is not clear whether he wanted both Rajpal (as captain by Mahesh Bhupathi) and Zeeshan Ali (as coach by Somdev Devvarman ) to be replaced, or only the latter. Devvarman is Nagal's mentor.The AITA subsequently appointed Ashutosh Singh as coach after Ali resigned.Nagal issued a detailed statement on the subject while also responding to the attack from the AITA that he skipped the Stockholm sojourn despite being fit.""It was a difficult decision to withdraw from the Davis Cup, as playing for the national team is a moment I cherish deeply. However, after consulting with my medical team, it became clear that competing while carrying an injury could not only jeopardize my health but also adversely impact the team’s chances,"" said Nagal, who on Thursday pulled out of the ATP 250 event in Hangzhou.""In professional sports, injury management is a complex science. Sometimes, just a few days of rest and targeted rehabilitation can make the difference between aggravating an injury and being fit to play again.""Regarding compensation, I want to clarify that it is standard practice in professional sports for athletes to be compensated for their participation in events, even when representing their country.""This is not about personal gain. My discussions with AITA and the Davis Cup Captain are confidential and I would not like to indulge in any speculation about this.""","Sumit Nagal had asked to be paid $50,000 a year for playing Davis Cup.
