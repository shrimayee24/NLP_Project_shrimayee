Bihar Exit Polls 2025: Poll of Polls Show NDA Poised For Majority, MGB Trails, No Impact of JSP

Two exit polls released Wednesday put NDA in the lead in Bihar, but while one projected a decisive verdict for BJP-led alliance with nearly two-thirds of the assembly's 243 seats, the other suggested it had a slender two percentage point lead in a close race and could be just a little over the halfway mark.The India Today-Axis My India poll projected that with 43% of the votes, NDA would get anywhere between 121 and 141 seats while the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan would end up with 41% of the votes and 98-118 seats. The midpoints of the ranges, at 131 and 108, are quite close to the verdict five years ago when NDA won 125 seats and MGB 110.Today's Chanakya projected 148-172 seats for the NDA and 65-89 seats for the MGB. The two-thirds mark is 162 seats. This poll gave the NDA a 44% vote share, six percentage points higher than the 38% projected for MGB.Both exit polls suggested that the much-talked-about Jan Suraaj of Prashant Kishor would have little impact and win few if any seats.Interestingly, the India Today poll forecasts that RJD will remain the single largest party in the assembly, but BJP could drop to the third spot with JDU improving its tally and the saffron party doing significantly worse than in 2020.Earlier, a slew of exit polls on Tuesday had all given NDA a clear majority in the state assembly, differing only in the extent of the incumbent alliance's victory. The results are to be declared on Friday.",Two exit polls released Wednesday put NDA in the lead in Bihar.

She detailed her journey of shifting from supporting her partner's career to rediscovering her own dreams and defining personal success. Bündchen emphasizes her graciousness towards Brady, highlighting her focus on authenticity and fulfillment in her new chapter.

Gisele Bündchen's shifting balance between support, career and self-fulfillment

Moving from high-stakes partnership to reinventing life on her own terms





In her March 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, how their lives evolved, and what she discovered in the space that followed. While details of their split had played out in headlines, Bündchen offered fresh context and a more nuanced perspective.Gisele Bündchen admitted that “It’s like a death and a rebirth,” and described her own shift from supporting a partner’s career to rediscovering her personal dreams. Her reflections reveal not just a high-profile breakup, but a woman reclaiming her voice and defining success on her own terms.When Gisele Bündchen met Tom Brady at age 26, she said she was “so ready” for family and partnership. Traditionally one of the world’s highest-earning models, she gradually scaled back her runway work after 2015 to support the family life they were building.Gisele Bündchen describes relocating to Tampa without ever having lived there before: “When we moved to Tampa, I actually had never been there before. I just arrived and that was my life.” Yet despite her enormous success, much of the public narrative painted her as “against football” or overshadowed by Brady’s career, a portrayal she calls “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”Bündchen underscores that marriage didn’t unravel overnight. “That takes years to happen.” As she puts it: “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart … When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are.”Gisele Bündchen's message: supporting someone doesn’t mean losing yourself, and that truth became clearer to her as her kids grew and her dreams quietly changed..Today, Gisele Bündchen speaks of her next act in Costa Rica, building a home, raising her children, and exploring wellness and nature far from red carpets. She asserts, “I have my own dreams.”While Tom Brady continued his historic career, Bündchen’s focus shifted inward. She embraced spiritual practices, daily rituals, and the idea that success is not just professional acclaim but authenticity and fulfillment. She says the breakup felt like both a loss and a liberation, “I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it’s beautiful to believe in that.”Gisele Bündchen's reflection on Brady is remarkably gracious. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever … If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him.”In doing so, Bündchen rejects reductive headlines and stereotypes, choosing instead to present a fuller picture of love, change and self-discovery. As she said, “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It’s not so black and white.”In the end, this isn’t a story solely of one of fashion’s biggest icons stepping aside. It’s the story of a woman stepping forward, redefining when a chapter ends, a new one begins..Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?",Supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady.

Giannis Antetokounmpo’s Injury Report vs Charlotte Hornets (November 12, 2025)

Milwaukee Bucks Injury Report vs Charlotte Hornets (November 12, 2025)

What to Expect Against the Hornets

Thetonight as they take on the Charlotte Hornets. Giannis is officially listed as questionable due to left knee patellar tendinopathy - a recurring issue that has required close monitoring by the Bucks’ medical staff throughout the season. While the condition isn’t considered severe, it continues to be a nagging concern for the two-time MVP, particularly as the team looks to manage his workload during the demanding early stretch of the season.The Milwaukee Bucks are exercising caution with Giannis, as his availability for tonight’s matchup will likely be determined after pregame warm-ups. His response to light drills and team activities will play a major role in whether he takes the court. The decision underscores Milwaukee’s focus on maintaining Giannis’ long-term health, given his central role in the franchise’s championship aspirations this season.Giannis Antetokounmpo has been on and off the injury report in recent weeks due to this lingering knee issue. Despite that, he has continued to deliver dominant performances when active, averaging over 33 points and 12 rebounds per game. The Bucks have strategically managed his minutes and training sessions to prevent aggravation, and the results have paid off - Giannis has looked explosive on offense while remaining a defensive anchor.The Milwaukee Bucks are currently battling for position near the top of the Eastern Conference standings, making Giannis’ availability critical. His presence on the floor dramatically shifts the team’s offensive rhythm and defensive stability, and any absence could expose Milwaukee’s depth concerns. With the team already dealing with multiple injuries, the pressure to keep Giannis healthy has never been greater.Milwaukee Bucks enters tonight’s contest with a few notable absences beyond Giannis Antetokounmpo. Kevin Porter Jr. remains out following right meniscus surgery, while Taurean Prince is sidelined with a neck strain. Additionally, Alex Antetokounmpo is unavailable as part of his G League two-way assignment. These absences have forced the Bucks to rely heavily on their core lineup and bench depth, increasing the load on players like Damian Lillard, Khris Middleton, and Brook Lopez to step up both offensively and defensively.Tonight’s game carries added weight as it marks the start of a two-game series with potential NBA Cup implications. The Bucks are expected to approach the matchup strategically, especially with Giannis’ status uncertain. If he suits up, expect him to play a leadership role, driving Milwaukee’s offense and setting the tone early against a Hornets team that has struggled with consistency and injuries of its own.However, if Giannis Antetokounmpo is ruled out, the Milwaukee Bucks will need to lean on their supporting cast to fill the void. Bettors and fans alike should monitor Milwaukee’s official injury report closer to tip-off, as any late updates on Giannis’ condition could significantly impact both the game’s outcome and betting lines.Also read: Is LaMelo Ball playing tonight vs the Milwaukee Bucks?

The Charlotte Hornets’ Struggles Without Ball

Coach’s Optimism and Recovery Outlook

Milwaukee Bucks vs Charlotte Hornets Game Outlook (November 12, 2025)

as they take on the Milwaukee Bucks on November 12, 2025. The Hornets’ star guard remains sidelined with a right ankle impingement, marking his fifth straight missed contest. His absence continues to impact Charlotte’s offensive rhythm and overall performance, as the team searches for stability early in the season.The injury has proven to be more troublesome than initially expected. Although Ball has been making progress in his recovery, the Hornets have not provided a definitive timeline for his return. The 24-year-old guard has struggled with ankle issues throughout his young career, and the team’s medical staff is taking a cautious approach to ensure he avoids another setback before rejoining the lineup.LaMelo Ball’s right ankle impingement first surfaced during the Hornets’ game on November 1. Since then, he has missed every matchup, with the team prioritizing long-term health over short-term results. The Hornets recently assigned Ball to their G League affiliate, the Greensboro Swarm, for a monitored ramp-up process. Reports indicate that he has been participating in limited practice sessions to rebuild strength and mobility, but he remains officially ruled out for the Bucks game tonight.Given his history of ankle sprains and fractures on both legs, Charlotte’s medical staff continues to take a measured approach to his rehabilitation.Charlotte Hornets’ season has taken a downturn in Ball’s absence. The team currently sits at 3-7, losing three consecutive games since the star guard went down. Offensively, the Hornets have lacked the playmaking and floor vision that Ball provides, which previously helped him average 23.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 9.8 assists per game this season. His ability to orchestrate the offense and elevate teammates has been sorely missed. To make matters worse, several other contributors - Brandon Miller, Josh Green, and Grant Williams - are also sidelined due to injuries, leaving the Hornets dangerously thin on both ends of the court.Head coach Charles Lee has remained optimistic about LaMelo Ball’s progress, emphasizing that the young guard is improving daily in movement and strength. Lee stated that the organization’s main focus is ensuring Ball’s complete recovery before returning to action. The recent assignment to the G League affiliate suggests that the Hornets are carefully preparing him for a gradual return to full-speed play. While there’s no set date for his comeback, Lee hinted that Ball could resume regular game activities once he clears all medical benchmarks.For tonight’s home matchup, the Hornets enter as underdogs against the Milwaukee Bucks. With LaMelo Ball out, Charlotte is expected to rely heavily on Collin Sexton, whose playmaking and assist numbers have notably increased when Ball isn’t on the court. Bettors looking at player props might find value in Sexton’s assist totals or scoring opportunities given his expanded role.Also read: Is Giannis Antetokounmpo’s playing tonight vs Charlotte Hornets? Latest uipdate on the Milwaukee Bucks star’s injury report (November 12, 2025) In summary, LaMelo Ball’s continued absence due to a right ankle impingement leaves the Hornets facing an uphill battle against the Bucks. While his recovery shows promising signs, Charlotte remains focused on a patient, long-term approach to ensure their franchise cornerstone returns fully healthy and ready to lead the team again.","LaMelo Ball remains sidelined with a right ankle impingement.

Klay Thompson apologizes to Megan Thee Stallion after airport mishap





Megan Thee Stallion on her relationship with Klay Thompson





Klay Thompson might be known for his calm demeanor on the court, but off it, the Dallas Mavericks star recently showed his softer side. After arriving late to pick up his girlfriend, rapper Megan Thee Stallion , from the airport, Thompson went viral for his heartfelt apology and his remorse. The clip, shared by Megan on social media, captured the NBA star trying to make amends with flowers in hand and genuine regret on his face.The moment quickly became a talking point among fans, who couldn’t get enough of the couple’s chemistry and Thompson’s down-to-earth approach. It also comes at a time when both are thriving in their respective careers, with Thompson beginning his new season in Dallas and Megan releasing new music inspired by their relationship.In the video posted online, Klay Thompson can be seen handing Megan a bouquet while apologizing repeatedly for showing up late. “Roses for my boo,” he said while driving her home. “I’m sorry I was late, babe. Damn it. I’m sorry. I thought I timed it well. Ah, just sorry. There’s no excuse.”Fans immediately flooded social media with amused and affectionate reactions, praising Thompson’s gesture as “adorably human.” The incident added another viral moment to their growing list of public appearances since confirming their romance earlier this year.Over the summer, the couple enjoyed a fishing trip that gave fans a glimpse into their playful dynamic. “So today, Klay is taking me on another adventure and we’re going fishing,” Megan said at the time. Thompson responded lovingly: “I got my queen on board, of course I feel cool. I’m the coolest guy in this harbor!”For Megan, whose real name is Megan Jovon Ruth Pete, the relationship marks a new chapter. “This is my first relationship where I’ve ever been with somebody who’s genuinely a nice person, and he makes me genuinely happy,” she told Page Six.“I just never dated somebody like him before and I’m just grateful that he’s here by my side and he feels the same way about me.”Despite occasional public skepticism — even from personalities like Shaquille O’Neal, who jokingly doubted their relationship on The Big Podcast — fans have embraced the pair’s authenticity. O’Neal later called Megan “athletic, so beautiful, and so gorgeous,” insisting his remarks were lighthearted.For now, Thompson and Megan seem unfazed by outside opinions. Their recent viral moment only serves to extend a genuine connection between two stars from different worlds. The duo has been very active on social media to share their personal moments of joy and love. Megan has over 32.7 million followers on Instagram, while Thomson has 16.8 million fans on the platform.Stallion is fully embracing her lover girl era — and fans are loving it. The three-time Grammy winner took to Instagram to tease a behind-the-scenes look at her new single “Lover Girl,” a song she openly admits is inspired by her boyfriend, NBA star Klay Thompson.“This is my song about Klay,” Megan said in the clip with a shy smile. “First n**** in life that has ever gotten a song outta me.” Fans quickly flooded the comments, cheering for the rapper’s happiness and her growing romance with the four-time NBA champion.Listeners have already picked up on the deeper meaning behind “Lover Girl.” In the track, Megan raps about finding someone who truly matches her energy and confidence. “Ayy, your n**** fantasy, my man reality,” she spits, celebrating a relationship built on mutual respect and balance.The lyrics hint at a future together too, with lines about “making big moves” which is a nod to the couple’s rumored move-in together. Fans praised how Thompson’s love seems to have brought out a softer, more radiant side of Megan. Speaking with Jennifer Hudson earlier this week, Megan opened up about how this chapter of her life feels different.“I’m in such a feminine era,” she said. “I’ve been through so much, and I feel like I was always on defense. But now I’m calm, relaxed, and more accepting of love.”Also Read: NBA’s highly anticipated Europe-based league’s potential release date revealed","Rapper Megan Thee Stallion and NBA star Klay Thompson have been dating for over a year.

The Houston Texans’ star player, C.J. Stroud, has been dealing with a brutal concussion as his absence has sparked some concern among fans.The Houston Texans have won four out of the nine matches played so far in the new season as fans await C.J. Stroud’s return to the field. Amid all the speculations, there has been an update on C.J. Stroud’s health as he continues to be away from the field after facing a concussion.A few hours ago, KPRC 2’s Aarion Wilson’s report has indicated that the Houston Texans’ star player, C.J. Stroud, is still pretty unwell.The report reads as, “Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud is still dealing with symptoms and remains under the NFL concussion protocol, preventing him from returning to practice…”The report added, “Stroud’s status under the protocol is expected to sideline him for a second game in a row Sunday against the Tennessee Titans with backup Davis Mills prepping to start again, per league sources.”A few days ago, the Houston Texans’ head coach, DeMeco Ryans, spoke to reporters in a press conference as he opened up about the injured players of the team.The Houston Texans’ head coach, DeMeco Ryans, said, “For C.J., Tytus, and Jalen, all three guys are still in the concussion protocol…”DeMeco Ryans added, “We’ll see, you know, how they progress throughout the week.”C.J.

Stephen Curry and his wife, Ayesha Curry have long been celebrated as one of the NBA’s most admired power couples. Married for over a decade and proud parents of four, their romance began when they were teenagers. They are believed to have met at a church in Charlotte, North Carolina, when both were teenagers.

Megan Thee Stallion’s testimony remains central as court affirms conviction



Lanez faces prison reality as Megan Thee Stallion’s star continues to rise



A California appeals court has denied rapper Tory Lanez’s final attempt to overturn his conviction for shooting Megan Thee Stallion , marking a decisive legal victory for the Houston-born Grammy winner. The ruling, issued Wednesday by the California 2nd District Court of Appeal, leaves Lanez’s 10-year prison sentence intact, nearly five years after the violent incident that captured global attention.The appellate judges rejected Lanez’s arguments that his trial was unfair and that evidence had been wrongly admitted. The decision means Megan Thee Stallion, now romantically linked to Dallas Mavericks star Klay Thompson, can finally close one of the darkest chapters of her career. Lanez, whose real name is Daystar Peterson, was convicted in December 2022 of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, having a loaded, unregistered weapon in a vehicle, and discharging it with gross negligence.During the 2022 trial, Megan Thee Stallion, born Megan Pete, testified that Lanez shot at her feet after an argument that followed a party at Kylie Jenner ’s Hollywood Hills home in July 2020. She told jurors that as she tried to walk away, Lanez shouted “Dance, b***h!” before firing several shots.Bullet fragments were later surgically removed from both of her feet.The appeals panel, led by Judge Anne H. Egerton, found that “the testimony was more than sufficient to support the jury’s finding that Peterson personally inflicted great bodily injury.” Egerton also ruled that the trial judge acted appropriately in allowing the jury to hear key evidence, including a recorded interview with Kelsey Harris, a friend who was in the SUV that night.“Once on the stand, to say Harris was a reluctant witness is an understatement,” Egerton wrote, defending the prosecution’s decision to present her earlier statement that directly implicated Lanez. The court also dismissed claims that prosecutors had introduced racial bias by mentioning Lanez’s tattoos, calling any potential error “harmless.”Lanez’s legal team had argued he was denied a fair trial, citing procedural errors and alleged prejudice from social media narratives. The judges, however, unanimously rejected those claims, stating, “We find no prejudicial error and, accordingly, affirm Peterson’s conviction.”The 33-year-old rapper, currently serving his sentence at the California Men’s Colony near San Luis Obispo, reportedly survived a stabbing attack earlier this year.Meanwhile, Megan Thee Stallion has continued to ascend in her career, with chart-topping hits and high-profile performances. Stallion’s romance with Klay Thompson has also been the talk of the town since the couple started dating in mid-July 2025.Also Read: “He was so skilled” – Lakers legend Magic Johnson mourns loss of his dear NBA friend who passed away after battling cancer","California appeals court affirms conviction of Tory Lanez for shooting Megan Thee Stallion.

Paolo Banchero exits early as Orlando Magic rule him out with left groin strain



Orlando Magic face a crucial stretch amid uncertainty over Banchero’s status



Orlando Magic star forward Paolo Banchero exited Wednesday night’s nationally televised matchup against the New York Knicks after sustaining a left groin strain during the second quarter. The team officially ruled him out for the remainder of the contest shortly after halftime. It’s an untimely setback for the 23-year-old, who has been the Magic’s offensive anchor this season.Banchero left the floor with 6:40 remaining in the second quarter and was initially listed as questionable to return. Before exiting, he logged 12 minutes of play, contributing four points on 1-of-4 shooting, along with four rebounds, two assists, one steal, and one block. His absence was felt almost immediately as Orlando’s early momentum slowed against a surging Knicks squad.The Orlando Magic confirmed that Paolo Banchero would not return due to a left groin strain, leaving fans and teammates concerned about his availability for upcoming games. The timing couldn’t be worse, as Orlando has been trying to find consistency after a rocky start to the season. With Banchero sidelined, forwards Jonathan Isaac and Tristan da Silva are expected to be called upon to absorb additional minutes.Banchero’s injury history adds another layer of concern. Last season, the forward missed several games due to an oblique injury, and the team will be cautious in evaluating his current status. Head coach Jamahl Mosley is expected to provide a medical update ahead of Friday’s matchup against the Brooklyn Nets. For now, Orlando can only hope the injury is minor and doesn’t sideline their All-Star long-term.In his fourth season, Banchero has averaged 23.3 points, 9.1 rebounds, and 4.3 assists in 34.6 minutes per game, ranking among the top young forwards in the Eastern Conference. His on-court leadership has been central to Orlando’s identity, particularly as the team battles for a playoff spot.Losing Banchero for any extended period could disrupt the Magic’s chemistry and test their depth. For now, all eyes will be on how quickly he recovers and whether the Magic can stay competitive without their franchise cornerstone. As of now, Magic has five wins and 6 defeats, but the team is eyeing to get back in the race in the standings as early as possible.Also Read: Klay Thompson’s girlfriend Megan Thee Stallion gets positive court update as Tory Lanez’s appeal dismissed in shooting case","Orlando Magic star forward Paolo Banchero exited Wednesday night’s nationally televised matchup against the New York Knicks after sustaining a left groin strain.

Conor McGregor’s legal team seeks a fresh appeal in the Supreme Court



A panel of three Supreme Court judges will meet on Thursday to review Conor McGregor’s application for a further appeal in a civil case where a jury found he assaulted Nikita Hand in a Dublin hotel. The meeting will take place in private, and the panel’s decision on whether to allow the appeal will be announced later. The judges' panel includes Ms Justice Elizabeth Dunne, Ms Justice Iseult O’Malley, and Mr Justice Séamus Woulfe, who will only permit the appeal if they find it raises a matter of public importance or is in the interests of justice.Last July, the Court of Appeal (CoA) dismissed McGregor’s appeal against the High Court civil jury’s finding that he assaulted Ms Hand at the Beacon Hotel on December 9th, 2018. The Court of Appeal also upheld the jury’s decision to award Ms Hand €250,000 in damages and ruled that McGregor must pay her legal costs.Since the Court of Appeal ruling, Conor McGregor has hired Mulholland Law to represent him in his application to the Supreme Court. The same firm is also acting for James Lawrence, who is seeking an appeal related to legal costs in the same case. Both applications will be considered by the court on Thursday.Mulholland Law filed the applications in September. In a statement at the time, it said McGregor and Lawrence were “deeply disappointed” by the lower court decisions.Mr Mulholland said McGregor’s application focuses on his right to silence, which he “properly exercised on occasions.” McGregor had replied “no comment” when questioned by gardai about Ms Hand’s allegations.During his CoA appeal, McGregor tried to introduce new evidence to challenge parts of Ms Hand’s story, including how she got her bruises. The new statements were later withdrawn. The CoA then allowed Ms Hand’s lawyers to refer some material to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Gardai later investigated and questioned two people, who were released without charge. A file is now being sent to the DPP for review.The UFC superstar is rumored to be back in the ring in June 2026 for a White House event. For now, the former UFC champion will await the Supreme Court’s decision, a verdict that could redefine his career and reputation.Also Read: Christian Lee opens up about brutal side of MMA ahead of ONE 173 rematch with Turkish fighter Alibeg Rasulov","Three Supreme Court judges will meet on Thursday to review Conor McGregor's application for a further appeal in a civil case.

Jets star ruled out as knee sprain worsens, could miss a month

New York Jets offense faces critical setback as Garrett Wilson recovery timeline confirmed

Garrett Wilson’s injury update is bad news for the New York Jets. The star wide receiver will not play in Week 11 after re-aggravating his right knee during Sunday’s win over the Cleveland Browns. According to ESPN’s Rich Cimini, Wilson is expected to miss three to four weeks with a knee sprain.He already missed two games earlier this season because of a hyperextended knee. Now, after just one game back, Wilson is sidelined again. The only positive development is that he avoided surgery, which keeps his hopes of returning before the regular season ends alive.Garrett Wilson suffered the injury while diving for a catch in the second half against Cleveland. He limped off and did not return. Head coach Aaron Glenn confirmed the injury involved the same knee that kept Wilson out in October. When reporters pressed him for a recovery timeline, Glenn declined to comment, citing ongoing evaluations.By Monday afternoon, ESPN reported that Garrett Wilson had a right knee sprain and would be out for at least three to four weeks. The team listed him as “out” on the Week 11 injury report after he missed consecutive practices.The Jets face the New England Patriots on Thursday night, and Wilson’s absence leaves a major gap in the offense.Before getting hurt again, Wilson had 36 catches for 395 yards and four touchdowns through seven games. It was the first time in his career he went without a single reception, as he was held catchless against Cleveland.With Garrett Wilson injured, the Jets’ offense is facing a serious test. Veteran Josh Reynolds remains on injured reserve because of a hip injury, and Allen Lazard was a healthy scratch last week. If Lazard sits again, the Jets’ wide receiver group will rely on rookie Arian Smith, Adonai Mitchell, Tyler Johnson, and John Metchie III, who just made his debut after being traded from the Philadelphia Eagles.Quarterback Justin Fields managed only six completions for 54 yards against the Browns, with most of that yardage coming from a short pass to Breece Hall. The Jets finished with 169 total yards in the game despite pulling off their second straight win after starting the season 0-7.Garrett Wilson’s injury comes at the worst possible moment for New York. The Jets finally found momentum under first-year coach Aaron Glenn, and losing their top wideout could stall that progress. If Wilson’s recovery stays on schedule, he could return as early as Dec. 7 against the Miami Dolphins or Dec. 14 against the Jacksonville Jaguars.","Garrett Wilson suffered the injury while diving for a catch in the second half against Cleveland.

Afghanistan cricketer on air strike by Pakistan, constant support from India

NEW DELHI: Afghanistan’s star cricketer Rashid Khan has finally addressed the growing online speculation surrounding a viral photograph of him with a woman at a recent charity event. On Tuesday, the leg-spinner confirmed on Instagram that the woman in the picture is his wife, putting an end to days of social media chatter and countless fan theories that had dominated online discussions.The controversy began earlier this month after a picture of Rashid with a woman surfaced from the launch of the Rashid Khan Charity Foundation in the Netherlands. The image, which showed the Afghanistan T20I captain seated beside a woman dressed in traditional attire, quickly went viral, sparking rumours about a “secret marriage.”Taking to Instagram, Rashid clarified that the woman seen in the viral photo is indeed his wife, and that the two had tied the knot in August this year. Sharing a series of wedding photos and a heartfelt note, Rashid wrote, “On August 2nd, I began a new and meaningful chapter of my life. I had my nikkah done and married a woman who embodies the love, peace and partnership I always hoped for.”He further added, “I recently took my wife to a charity event and it’s unfortunate to see assumptions being made from something so simple.

Virat Kohli’s influence on Indian cricket is not limited to his records with the bat or his success as Test captain. One of his biggest contributions has been the change he brought to the team’s approach to fitness.Former India cricketer and 1983 World Cup winner Sandeep Patil recently shared a story on a podcast that shows how Kohli’s commitment to fitness made a strong impact on him and motivated the former selector to hit the gym.Patil recalled that during India’s 2016 tour of the West Indies, he went for a morning walk on a beach in Antigua with his wife. ""It was pitch dark, and I noticed a shadow sitting quietly. As I went closer, it was Virat doing yoga — at five in the morning, on a match day,"" he said.Kohli did not stop after yoga. He went to the gym for 45 minutes, had breakfast, and later scored a double century in the Test. ""When he returned to the hotel after the day’s play, he went back to the gym again,"" Patil said.Patil added that Kohli encouraged him to start working on his fitness. ""Virat told me, ‘Sandeep bhai, you have a nice height and personality; you should start working out.’ So, for the first time in my life, I went to the gym. I was 60 then,"" he said.The Antigua Test Patil referred to was the first of a four-match Test series between India and West Indies in 2016.

MUMBAI: Mumbai chief selector Sanjay Patil has made it clear that he is yet to hear from Rohit Sharma , amidst reports that the former India captain is set to make himself available for the Vijay Hazare Trophy.“I have not received any message from Rohit Sharma yet. But if he plays for Mumbai, it will be good for us. It will be a good thing for the youngsters. I really appreciate this great step by the BCCI Ajit Agarkar (chief selector) and Gautam Gambhir (India head coach) (of asking India players to turn out for their teams in domestic cricket when available),” Patil told TOI on Wednesday. Another senior Mumbai Cricket Association official too said that he did not have any formal communication in this regard from the veteran batting superstar.However, the fact that Rohit trained at the MCA-BKC ground for nearly an hour last week, when Mumbai were playing their home Ranji Trophy game against Himachal Pradesh, is a good enough indication that Rohit will want to play some competitive cricket when he can.The group stage of the Vijay Hazare Trophy will be held between Dec 24, 2025 and January 8, 2026. Mumbai have been placed in Elite Group C, alongside Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Himachal, Maharashtra, Punjab, and Goa and will play their matches in Jaipur.The three-match ODI series against South Africa will be held from Dec 3-9, while the next one against New Zealand will take place from Jan 11 – both at home.Earlier this year, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had made it compulsory that all the India players must feature in domestic cricket, when not on national duty and not injured or recuperating at the Centre of Excellence (CoE). As a result of that BCCI directive, Rohit and Virat Kohli both featured in a Ranji Trophy game for Mumbai and Delhi, respectively. However, the two greats now only play in the ODI format for India.Meanwhile, in a big boost for Mumbai, off-spinner Tanush Kotian and seamer Mohit Sawasthi are set to return to Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy team against Pondicherry at the Wankhede Stadium from Nov 16. Kotian missed Mumbai's last two matches as he was busy turning out for India A against South Africa A at the BCCI's CoE-he took eight wickets (4-83 & 4-26) in the first of the two ‘tests’ of that series. In a significant development, also returning to action after a long lay-off due to injury is seamer Mohit Awasthi, who last played for Mumbai in the 2024-25 Ranji Trophy semifinal against Vidarbha at Nagpur in Feb this year. The 32-year-old has taken 99 wickets in 31 first-class matches.Off-spinner Himanshu Singh, who was drafted in Kotian's place and took three for 26 in the first innings against Himachal, and seamer Irfan Umair have been excluded from the squad.","Mumbai chief selector Sanjay Patil has made it clear that he is yet to hear from Rohit Sharma.

Poll Do you think Mayank Markande will have an impactful return to Mumbai Indians? Yes, absolutely No, he won't make a difference Maybe, depends on game time Not sure

Two days before the Indian Premier League (IPL) retention deadline ends, Mumbai Indians ' (MI) activity has picked up. The five-time title winners have approached Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) for leg-spinner Mayank Markande , and it’s reliably learnt that the conversations have reached the final stages. If all goes well, the trade could be announced soon, and the 28-year-old will be back with the franchise where he started his IPL journey in 2018.It is not confirmed at this stage whether another player is involved in the deal, as insiders feel it could well be an all-cash transaction. KKR bought the wrist-spinner for ₹30 lakh at the mega auction last year but didn’t give him a single game in the entire season.MI have two wrist-spinners — Vignesh Puthur (chinaman) and Karn Sharma — and Markande’s inclusion gives them more options in the spin department. Markande had a brilliant debut season for MI, where he picked up 15 wickets in 14 games and went on to make his India debut less than a year after the IPL.He played only one T20I for India before things went south, and he didn’t get enough game time in the cash-rich league. In the next five years, even after joining two different teams, Markande could play only 23 games.Markande, however, is not the only leggie on MI’s radar. It is understood that there was, or still is, some interest in Rahul Chahar too, but it can’t be confirmed whether the interest materialised into any engagement with Sunrisers Hyderabad.The SRH camp wasn’t convinced with Chahar last season and played him in just one game, even after picking him for Rs 3.20 crore at the mega auction. In the intra-squad games, the SRH management found Chahar way off the mark and were happy to keep him on the bench.MI’s interest in Chahar is again not a surprise, as he too had a successful stint with the franchise.","MI have approached Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) for leg-spinner Mayank Markande.

Can the Connor Bedard–Macklin Celebrini friendship shape the future of Canadian hockey ?

The forthcoming NHL talent has been the talk of the town already, and among the leading ones are Connor Bedard and Macklin Celebrini, who, being the two young centers, are literally re-shaping the whole idea of franchise players. The first overall picks in consecutive drafts, both players have quickly become stars who are impacting their teams instantly. However, in spite of the ongoing comparisons, what really distinguishes them is their mutual respect and powerful friendship.Connor Bedard, who is the poster boy of the Chicago Blackhawks, has lately talked very kindly about Macklin Celebrini, who is becoming the best player of the San Jose Sharks this season. There exists a bond between the two that is as deep as their childhood in British Columbia, and they have grown closer through their similar routes, being not just rivals but supporters sharing each other’s achievements.When speaking of Macklin Celebrini season, Connor Bedard could not at all conceal his excitement for the Canadian buddy. Him and I are good buddies. The funny part about it is every time he gets a point or scores, I'm one of the happiest guys.I'm just excited for him; he's doing so well, and their team is having success.I know (that) the most important thing to him.""Their bond is a true depiction of the coming era of NHL stars—being competitive at the same time supportive, “driven” yet “grounded.” Both players are aspiring to create winning atmospheres in their respective teams while at the same time being under huge expectations. Their friendship, instead of rivalry, has turned into an invigorating story in the contemporary sports world characterized by high pressure.During the course of the season, Connor Bedard and Celebrini keep finding ways to demonstrate that it is possible to have two greats at the same time. The two youngsters' taking of respect for one another and competing hard together can indeed determine the future of the NHL and maybe even see both of them playing under the Maple Leaf at the 2026 Winter Olympics.More coverage on NHL",Connor Bedard is the poster boy of the Chicago Blackhawks.

NEW DELHI: Ten days ago, Dinesh had travelled from Delhi to his village Ganeshpur in UP’s Shravasti to celebrate Diwali. He spent the afternoon decorating the mud walls of his home with his daughters, Bitta, 7, and Srishti, 4, before joining the evening prayers.His eldest son, Himanshu, 8, clung to his hand, reluctant to let go when it was time for him to leave. “I’ll be back soon,” Dinesh had said. “Just after the next order.”He worked at a printing press in Chandni Chowk, earning enough to send money home every few weeks. The work was hard but steady, and Delhi had begun to feel familiar — a rented room near the press, tea from the same stall each morning.His wife Reena Devi stayed back in Ganeshpur with the children, while his brothers Guddu and Rajesh worked as labourers elsewhere in Delhi. His father, Bhure Mishra, a farmer, called every Sunday to ask if he was eating well. “He always said the same thing,” Bhure recalled later. “Bas kuch din ki baat hai — just a matter of a few days.”On Monday evening, the blast near Red Fort ripped through that small certainty.For hours, the family tried calling. When no one answered, Guddu rode his motorcycle through the city’s chaos toward Chandni Chowk. He was the one who found Dinesh at LNJP Hospital.“I want to appeal to the PM to help us,” said Bhure. “Whatever we receive, it will go to the children.”Villagers gathered outside the Mishra home, some holding small lamps left over from Diwali. Inside, Reena sat on the floor, her hands motionless in her lap. “He called every night,” she whispered. “He said Delhi was noisy but good for work.”","Dinesh Mishra worked at a printing press in Chandni Chowk, earning enough to send money home every few weeks.

Because of that, when I would get high, I wouldn't want to go out in public.”The 70 year old NBA legend also reiterated that he never sold drugs or drove his car while he was “smoking” it.A year back, Micheal Ray Richardson also spoke to The Guardian about drugs being used in the league today.He said, “Even now…it’s not like it was back in the 80s when I was [playing].

India cricketers spotted chilling Hobart ahead of T20I vs Australia

New Zealand secured a 3-1 series victory over West Indies in the fifth Twenty20 international at Dunedin on Thursday, winning by eight wickets. Jacob Duffy 's outstanding performance of 4-35, including three crucial wickets in the third over, helped restrict West Indies to 140 runs, which New Zealand chased down successfully in the 16th over.Duffy's early strikes reduced West Indies to 21-4, and he later returned to dismiss Romario Shepherd, who had scored a quick 36 from 22 balls. West Indies were eventually bowled out in 18.4 overs.New Zealand's chase was commanding, with Devon Conway remaining unbeaten on 47. He built crucial partnerships of 69 with Tim Robinson (45 off 24 balls), 37 with Rachin Ravindra (21), and 35 with Mark Chapman (21 not out).The series saw West Indies winning the first match by seven runs, followed by New Zealand's victories in the second and third matches by three runs and nine runs respectively. All these matches went down to the final over, while the fourth match was abandoned due to rain.Duffy, who claimed 10 wickets in the series, was named Player of the Series.""I guess in Twenty20 a huge asset of mine is that swing up top and taking wickets in the power play is always pretty important,"" Duffy said. ""Maybe less so against the West Indies, such is the length of their batting lineup. I guess that's always my role in the team is to swing the ball up top and try to make things happen.""West Indies started aggressively after losing the toss, with Alick Athanaze hitting a six off Duffy's first ball. However, the University Oval pitch offered assistance to the New Zealand pacers, with 19 dot balls in the first five overs. Kyle Jamieson dismissed Athanaze in the second over through a return catch. Duffy then removed Shai Hope (11), Ackeem Auguste (8), and Sherfane Rutherford (0) in quick succession.Rovman Powell's dismissal for 11 left West Indies struggling at 48-5. Roston Chase (38) and Jason Holder (20) offered some resistance with a 42-run partnership.Shepherd's late assault, featuring three fours and three sixes, helped West Indies reach 140 before Duffy returned to end their innings.The teams will now shift focus to a three-match ODI series. West Indies will welcome back John Campbell to their squad, while Matthew Forde, Johann Layne, and Shamar Springer will strengthen their pace attack.The West Indies will be without injured players Alzarri Joseph, Shamar Joseph, Ramon Simmonds, and Jediah Blades for the upcoming series.The first ODI is scheduled for Sunday at Hagley Oval in Christchurch.",New Zealand secure 3-1 series victory over West Indies.

Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Axar Patel and more depart for Australia from Delhi

Poll Do you agree that a captain's leadership is not determined by their fluency in English? Yes, skills matter more. No, communication is key.

NEW DELHI: India all-rounder Axar Patel has opened up on a lesser-discussed bias in Indian cricket — the perception that a captain's leadership ability is tied to his fluency in English or public image. Ahead of India's first Test against South Africa at Eden Gardens, Patel said that being articulate in English is not what defines a good leader; instead, it's the ability to understand players and bring out their best.Patel, who led Delhi Capitals (DC) in IPL 2025 after Rishabh Pant 's departure, said people often underestimate cricketers based on how they communicate. “People start saying, ‘Oh, he's not captaincy material, he doesn't speak English. How will he talk?' Arre! Captain's work is not to just talk. Captain's work is to know the player and see how to get the best out of him — what's his strength, what's his weakness,” Axar told The Indian Express.He argued that fans and commentators have created a flawed notion of what makes a good captain. “If we say ‘personality chahiye, acha English bolna chahiye' – that's a perception made by the public based on their own thinking. I captained Delhi Capitals this year and got a lot of praise. I think if more of this happens, more will change in the coming time,” he said.Axar added that public judgment today is often shaped by appearances, media portrayal, and social media presence.“It's all about what you see and what the media is showing. How active you are on social media, how you talk — people judge you on all that. Everyone likes to give opinions these days — he's capable, he's not capable, make him captain, don't make him captain,” he remarked.The 31-year-old said those within the game know how to value cricketers for their skill, not style. “People in cricket know what's the value of a player. At the end of the day, that's what matters – what the people around you think. So yeah, just do your job,” he said.Axar is expected to feature in India's two-Test series against South Africa, starting November 14 in Kolkata — his first red-ball appearance since February 2024.",Axar Patel says people often underestimate cricketers based on how they communicate.
