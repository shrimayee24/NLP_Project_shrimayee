Delhi’s worsening air quality cast a shadow over Lionel Messi ’s farewell appearance in India, as a section of the crowd at the Arun Jaitley Stadium voiced its anger at the political leadership even while welcoming the global football icon.As Chief Minister Rekha Gupta stepped onto the stage on Monday to receive Messi during the final leg of the GOAT India Tour, chants of “AQI, AQI” rang out from parts of the stands. The reaction came amid hazardous pollution levels in the national capital, with the Air Quality Index touching 498 in the morning before easing slightly to 427 by evening, remaining in the ‘severe’ category for the third consecutive day. Visibility across the city dropped sharply, with a thick haze obscuring the skyline.The chants contrasted sharply with the celebratory atmosphere inside the stadium, where nearly 25,000 fans had gathered to catch a glimpse of Messi. The Delhi leg marked the conclusion of a tour that had begun chaotically in Kolkata but ended on a more organised note in the capital. Spectators packed the stands, many wearing Argentina’s blue and white jersey with the iconic No. 10, while celebrities and dignitaries watched from inside the ground.Messi, speaking briefly in Spanish, thanked the crowd for the affection shown throughout his India visit. He described the experience as intense but unforgettable, saying the love he received exceeded expectations and promising that he would return to India someday, possibly to play a match.After arriving at the stadium, Messi walked around the field smiling, watched the 7x7 celebrity match conclude, and waved repeatedly to the crowd. Alongside Inter Miami teammates Luis Suarez and Rodrigo De Paul, he kicked footballs into the stands during a lap of honour and later felicitated the Minerva Academy football team. The reception was notably freer than in Kolkata, where heavy security and political entourages had limited fan interaction.The tightly scripted 30-minute programme revolved largely around Messi. He was joined on stage by Rekha Gupta, ICC chairman Jay Shah , DDCA president Rohan Jaitley and former India football captain Bhaichung Bhutia towards the end of the event.While Messi mania dominated the evening, the chants inside the stadium underlined a growing public frustration over Delhi’s air crisis, turning a celebratory sporting moment into a pointed reminder of the capital’s ongoing environmental emergency.",Delhi's worsening air quality cast a shadow over Lionel Messi’s farewell appearance in India.

The team rushed to the spot within minutes, secured the carcass and alerted senior officials. While the cub was crushed under the vehicle's wheels, its sibling, KGP-3, managed to escape.Senior forest and police officers, including the chief conservator of forest (CCF) in charge of Kuno National Park, divisional forest officers from Gwalior and Kuno, and local police personnel, reached the site.","The male cheetah cub, KGP-4, was killed around 6.15 am near Simariya Mod under the Ghatigaon police station limits, about 40 km from Gwalior.

Could Blake Lively make a surprise appearance with Travis Kelce in Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour documentary? Fan speculation heats up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/could-blake-lively-make-a-surprise-appearance-with-travis-kelce-in-taylor-swifts-eras-tour-documentary-fan-speculation-heats-up/articleshow/125992717.cms,"Fans eagerly await potential unseen footage of Blake Lively in Taylor Swift's Eras Tour documentary. Their enduring, private friendship holds deep emotional weight for viewers, who see a possible cameo as a personal affirmation of loyalty and continuity amidst Swift's monumental tour. The documentary's blend of performance and personal storytelling fuels this anticipation.

Why Blake Lively’s possible cameo carries emotional weight for fans

For years, Taylor Swift and Blake Lively have represented one of pop culture’s most enduring celebrity friendships, blending music, film, family, and quiet loyalty away from the spotlight. As Swift’s Eras Tour documentary continues to roll out on Disney+, fans are once again analyzing every frame for personal moments that reveal life behind the stadium lights.With additional episodes set to arrive later this month, online speculation has intensified around whether Lively might appear in unseen footage. The curiosity isn’t just about a cameo, it reflects a deeper fascination with how Swift’s inner circle fits into one of the most ambitious tours in modern music history. For longtime fans, even a brief glimpse could feel meaningful.The Eras Tour documentary is not just a concert film, it functions as a time capsule of Swift’s creative process, personal resilience, and trusted relationships during a career-defining moment. While the project already features collaborators, dancers, and close friends, Lively’s absence so far has stood out to fans who have followed the duo’s friendship for over a decade.Their bond has often unfolded quietly, through shared milestones rather than constant public appearances. That low-profile dynamic has only fueled curiosity, especially since Lively has remained largely out of the public eye in recent months amid a widely discussed legal dispute connected to a past film project.As a result, some fans see a potential documentary appearance as symbolic, not promotional, but personal.What also adds intrigue is timing. The remaining episodes are expected to spotlight more candid moments from Swift’s tour life, including downtime, private celebrations, and emotional checkpoints behind the scenes. If Lively does appear, it would likely be organic rather than staged, reinforcing the authenticity Swift has emphasized throughout the project.Beyond speculation, the conversation highlights something larger: the Eras Tour documentary has blurred the line between performance and personal storytelling. Fans aren’t only watching for vocals and choreography, they’re searching for quiet confirmations of loyalty, healing, and continuity amid massive success.Whether Lively ultimately appears or not, the attention underscores how invested audiences remain in Swift’s personal narrative. A brief moment, a background shot, or even an off-camera mention would be enough to spark discussion. For now, viewers are watching closely, convinced that if the friendship does surface, it will do so naturally, just like it always has.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour has a hidden Joe Alwyn connection amid her engagement to Travis Kelce","Fans eagerly await potential unseen footage of Blake Lively in Taylor Swift's Eras Tour documentary.

Who really wins this deal?

Atlanta Braves rumors are gaining serious traction as Atlanta continues to explore a blockbuster trade for Texas Rangers shortstop Corey Seager, a move that would instantly reshape the National League playoff picture. The two-time World Series MVP remains one of baseball’s most dangerous left-handed bats, and even preliminary interest from the Braves has ignited fan speculation across the league. While no deal is close, the combination of Atlanta’s glaring shortstop need and Texas’ willingness to listen on veterans has turned this into one of the most fascinating “what if” scenarios of the offseason.According to multiple reports from the Winter Meetings, the Atlanta Braves have checked in on Seager as they search for a long-term solution at shortstop following years of instability since Dansby Swanson’s departure. However, the biggest complication is structural rather than financial: Atlanta is on Corey Seager’s no-trade list, meaning any deal would require the star shortstop’s direct approval.That reality has kept discussions preliminary. Rangers GM Chris Young has publicly acknowledged openness to moving pieces as Texas adjusts payroll after dealing Marcus Semien, but there have been no substantial negotiations involving Seager’s contract, which still carries roughly $186 million over the next six seasons.Jeff Passan and other national insiders have framed Atlanta’s interest as exploratory, yet persistent.The Atlanta Braves’ motivation is clear. Atlanta’s shortstop production in 2025 ranked among the weakest of any contender, combining for just 1.1 fWAR with minimal power and on-base ability. Seager would immediately flip that weakness into a strength, giving the lineup another elite bat alongside Ronald Acuña Jr. and Matt Olson.Pundits have described Seager as a massive offensive upgrade over options like Mauricio Dubón, not only for his power but for his postseason résumé. His presence would allow Atlanta to stabilize the infield, either by keeping Seager at shortstop or shifting him to DH while adjusting Ozzie Albies defensively.While any proposal remains speculative, industry chatter has centered on a prospect-heavy return rather than elite, untouchable names. One scenario floated by analysts involves Atlanta sending mid-tier arms and depth pieces to Texas, paired with financial relief.Potential structure discussed by insiders includes:• Pitching prospects such as Hurston Waldrep and Dylan Dodd• Additional secondary pieces to balance value• Texas retaining $10–15 million annually to ease Seager’s $31 million AAVThe Rangers would gain controllable pitching for a retooling phase, while the Braves would absorb a superstar contract aligned with a win-now window. The largest hurdle remains Seager’s willingness to waive his no-trade clause, something considered unlikely but not impossible if competitive priorities outweigh geography.From the Texas Rangers’ perspective, moving Seager would signal a clear pivot. After an 81-81 season and mounting payroll pressure, shedding long-term salary while restocking a thinned farm system has appeal. Still, trading away a franchise face and postseason hero would be a tough sell internally and publicly.At 31, Seager’s durability has become part of the conversation, having missed significant time in recent seasons. Texas could choose to move early rather than risk decline, but replacing a hitter with a .289 career average and elite playoff production is no small task.The contrast between Seager and Atlanta’s recent shortstop output highlights why this rumor won’t fade quietly.Advanced metrics paint an even sharper picture. Seager’s .365 wOBA and 15.3 percent barrel rate dwarf Atlanta’s infield production, with projections suggesting 30-plus home run potential in Truist Park.• Proven MVP-caliber talent fills a major lineup hole• Left-handed power plays well against NL East pitching• Postseason experience strengthens October ceiling• Injury history over the past two seasons• $31 million AAV strains payroll flexibility• No-trade clause could halt talks entirely• Prospect infusion for a system needing depth• Long-term salary relief• Opportunity to reset roster timeline• Loss of a franchise cornerstone• Difficulty replacing elite offensive production• Fan backlash following recent payroll cutsIf Corey Seager were to approve a move, Atlanta would land one of the biggest trade prizes imaginable, instantly shifting the NL East balance of power and positioning themselves to challenge Philadelphia at the top of the division. For Texas, the return would help stabilize the future but at the cost of star power and identity.Alsi read: MLB trade rumors: Boston Red Sox might sign $116.5 million Arizona Diamondbacks superstar to bolster rotation in Winter Meetings For now, this remains a high-end hypothetical rather than an imminent blockbuster. Still, as long as the Braves are searching for answers at shortstop and the Rangers remain open to restructuring their roster, Corey Seager’s name will continue to hover over the offseason like a spark waiting for fuel.",Atlanta Braves are reportedly exploring a trade for Texas Rangers shortstop Corey Seager.

Dwyane Wade reflects on LeBron James in Year 23





Dwyane Wade and LeBron James memories from the Heat era





The bond between Dwyane Wade and LeBron James has always been special. As James steps into Year 23, Wade no longer speaks as a former teammate alone. He speaks as a fan who understands what the league is slowly preparing to lose. Recently, Wade commented on James’ 23rd NBA season comes contemplating who shared championships, pressure, and history with James at the highest level.Wade’s words arrive at a time when every appearance by LeBron feels meaningful. The milestones keep coming, yet the uncertainty lingers. For Wade, that reality has shifted how he watches the game now. There is admiration, reflection, and a sense of time closing in on an era few believed possible.Speaking candidly, Dwyane Wade did not hide the emotion tied to watching James still perform at an elite level. His appreciation felt personal and honest.“I’m like you guys, I’m a fan. I know it’s like, ‘he’s old, he should retire’. But at the same time, I’m gonna miss him… He’s just taking these moments in, we don’t know when the last one is coming.”Wade’s praise for James is not a one time thing. Previously, in episode of Wy Network by Dwyane Wade, the Heat legend shared his candid thoughts.“I have the greatest body of work of anybody that’s ever put a Miami Heat jersey on,” Wade said.“If you wanna be honest, LeBron James is the greatest player to ever put a Miami Heat jersey on… I’m the greatest player in the history of the Miami Heat for the body of work I had wearing that jersey, but I’m not the greatest player to ever put on a Miami Heat jersey.”Dwyane Wade retired from the NBA in 2019 after 16 seasons, mostly with the Miami Heat. He admitted his burst was fading and the joy was gone, even as a Hall of Famer. Since retiring, Wade thrives as a businessman, media voice, and NBA owner, while proudly supporting his daughter Zaya.Wade recently revisited another iconic chapter with humor while recalling the famous Big Three introduction. His memory of that moment revealed both restraint and foresight.“Let’s run that tape who was it again. It’s one voice and look at the one in the middle laughing like young boy over here was talking… he was feeling the moment… look I look put my head down, look I put my head down, ‘I’m like hey man look now I’mma supportive teammate.'”“I’m my rubbing my knee I’m like ‘Oh I don’t know if I got that much… He trippin’, look I ain’t said a word… That was that supposed to have been a moment that was just for our fans and it should not have been the world should not have seen.”“That’s something that you say internal, you know what I mean? We going to win every year but really you know how hard it is to win one year. I don’t care what kind of talent you have so that’s why I was sitting there like oh my man don’t know yet.”“But he did go to the Finals 10 years in a row though. He damn sure didn’t like about how many opportunities. He almost did it, he ain’t lie… Listen, we went 4, he went 10.”In September this year, the 2025 Basketball Hall of Fame weekend carried special meaning for LeBron James and Dwyane Wade. While Wade was inducted in 2023 and James awaits retirement, both attended to honor the 2008 Team USA “Redeem Team.” The group’s induction marked a defining chapter in USA Basketball history. James and Wade shared a light moment before the ceremony, reflecting their long bond. The duo helped lead Team USA to Olympic gold in Beijing after the 2004 setback. That victory sparked a dominant run, with five straight Olympic gold medals since 2008.LeBron James is not stopping despite recent injury setbacks. The King got back on his feet and made a strong comeback. So far, he has not shared any update on his retirement.Also Read: ""The Kings are here"": LeBron James & Jay-Z's courtside moment sends NBA fans into meltdown","Dwyane Wade reflects on LeBron James' 23rd NBA season.

IPL mini auction: Lot of interest for Cam Green | Wait ends for Prithvi Shaw, Sarfaraz Khan?

Mallika Sagar will be a familiar and significant presence when the IPL 2026 auction unfolds on Tuesday, December 16. For many fans, her presence in the room has become part of the modern IPL auction experience. Yet behind that composed exterior lies a journey that is both unusual and groundbreaking.Born in Mumbai in 1975, Sagar has built a rare career that bridges two traditionally exclusive worlds — fine art and elite sports auctions. Raised in a business-minded household, her fascination with auctioneering began unexpectedly, sparked by a book that featured a woman auctioneer as its protagonist. That early inspiration eventually set her on a path few in India had walked before.Sagar’s academic journey took her from Mumbai to Connecticut, before she graduated with a degree in Art History from Bryn Mawr College in Philadelphia. In 2001, she began her professional career at Sotheby’s London, developing deep expertise in Indian and South Asian art. Her rise was swift and historic. At the age of 26, she became Christie’s first Indian woman auctioneer in New York, specialising in modern and contemporary Indian art — a landmark achievement that established her credibility on the global auction circuit.After gaining years of international experience, Sagar returned to Mumbai and worked closely with renowned institutions such as Pundole’s Art Gallery. Her success in the art world laid the groundwork for a seamless transition into sports auctions, where her clarity, precision and authority quickly stood out.The turning point came in 2021 when she was appointed the first female auctioneer in the Pro Kabaddi League , breaking another long-standing barrier in a male-dominated space. Two years later, she was entrusted with conducting the inaugural Women’s Premier League auction, further cementing her growing influence in Indian sport.She subsequently conducted the IPL 2024 mini-auction and the high-profile IPL 2025 mega auction held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.In 2025, Sagar added yet another milestone by leading the WPL 2026 auction, reinforcing her status as one of the most trusted and accomplished auctioneers in the sport.","Mallika Sagar will be a familiar and significant presence when the IPL 2026 auction unfolds on Tuesday, December 16.

As the IPL 2026 mini auction gets underway on Tuesday, 16 December, attention is not just on the bidding battles but on a key rule that has quietly reshaped how overseas players are paid. While franchises may still drive prices higher inside the auction room, foreign cricketers will not take home the full amount once bidding crosses a fixed threshold.Under regulations enforced by the IPL governing council, overseas players can earn a maximum of INR 18 crore from the mini auction, regardless of how high franchises push the bidding. Even if a player attracts offers beyond that figure, his final salary will remain capped.The rule comes into focus as teams get ready to spend heavily. Kolkata Knight Riders enter the auction with the largest purse of INR 64.3 crore, while Chennai Super Kings have INR 43.6 crore. Despite the financial muscle on display, the new cap ensures that international stars will not receive inflated pay packets.The ceiling was introduced by the BCCI ahead of the IPL 2025 mega auction and has now been applied to mini auctions as well. It matches the highest retention slab from the previous mega auction, effectively keeping overseas salaries at a consistent maximum level.The move is aimed at enforcing financial discipline and preventing runaway inflation, a recurring trend in mini auctions driven by supply and demand gaps.In recent seasons, mini auctions have produced eye catching figures for overseas fast bowlers and all-rounders, often despite limited availability because of international schedules. Such deals triggered concerns around fairness, long term budgeting and the sustainability of franchise spending.Under the current framework, if an overseas player is bid up to INR 20 crore, he will still receive only INR 18 crore. The remaining INR 2 crore is transferred to the BCCI’s player welfare fund. Crucially, the franchise must still pay the full bid amount from its purse.The restriction applies only to overseas players. Indian cricketers remain exempt and will receive the full value of their winning bids, even if the amount exceeds INR 18 crore.","IPL 2026 mini auction gets underway on Tuesday, 16 December.

How do Connor McDavid and Kris Knoblauch view Edmonton Oilers’ Goaltending trade?

Edmonton Oilers Trade Skinner + Kulak For Jarry + Poulin Thoughts | Quinn Hughes To Wild

On Saturday, the Edmonton Oilers' locker room was filled with a combination of feelings and expectations as the team prepared for a huge roster change before their game against the Toronto Maple Leafs. The exchange that sent goalie Stuart Skinner and defenseman Brett Kulak to the Pittsburgh Penguins was a drastic change for a team that had trusted both players during their long playoff runs. The names of Connor McDavid , Kris Knoblauch, Tristan Jarry, and Spencer Stastney were soon among the top talks of Edmonton, looking ahead to the future. The trade marked an emotional shift ahead of Edmonton's next chapter.The move was meant to tackle the goalkeeping issues, but the human aspect of the decision could not be overlooked. Skinner had been with the Oilers for parts of six seasons and had helped the team reach the Stanley Cup Finals twice in a row. Kulak was also a dependable player on the defense. After the morning skate, McDavid talked about how hard the moment was, and he made it clear that the loss of the familiar faces weighed on the team, even as they were getting ready for a new chapter.Connor McDavid called the trade a tough decision that the team had to make, and at the same time pointed to the positive side of the situation by saying how much the group would miss Skinner and Kulak.Head Coach Kris Knoblauch was equally supportive, stating that both players had been very dependable over the years, contributing not only on but also off the ice. Another ex-Oilers defenseman, Troy Stecher, who now plays for Toronto, offered his insight into the situation, too. He referred to the trade as part of the business and wished his ex-colleagues nothing but the best in their new home, Pittsburgh.The focus was then directed towards the newly recruited players. Knoblauch showed trust in Tristan Jarry and mentioned his experience and the good results he had in the past, despite a hard previous season. Jarry, who got the call against Toronto, shared that the last day and a half had been full of emotions but added that getting to play with superstars like McDavid and Leon Draisaitl was a thrill. At the same time, the rapid development of Spencer Stastney, who has been skating and moving the puck well, caught the coaching staff's attention, which believed that such a skill would bring the team more balance.The Oilers are taking change with a careful and optimistic attitude. The loss of reliable teammates is painful, but Edmonton is convinced that this kind of change will help the team to be better and thus to navigate through the season.Also Read: NHL Injury Update: Evgeni Malkin sidelined as Pittsburgh Penguins face playoff pressure","Edmonton Oilers traded goalie Stuart Skinner and defenseman Brett Kulak to the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Dak Prescott says he will not give up till the Cowboys have a firm answer

The Dallas Cowboys lost 34–26 to the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, which casts doubt over their postseason hopes. Their chances of reaching the playoffs now stand at just 1 per cent. Dallas can only qualify if they win its final three games, while the Eagles would need to lose all of theirs. It’s technically possible, but fans widely believe it’s unrealistic for them to have their hopes up.Quarterback Dak Prescott also had a novel reaction to their situation and did not sugarcoat his feelings about the team’s performance.“Unfortunately, I’m sure the playoffs are out of the picture,” Prescott said recently. “... You can’t just give up. You can’t just stop. You can’t just say, ‘Oh, we’re not going to the playoffs.’ It’s the National Football League. I just saw a team Thursday night that’s not going to the playoffs beat a good team and knock them out.However, Dak made sure to assure fans that he will only put his best foot forward. “Nothing’s going to change for me, and that’s going to be my influence as a leader. My message to anybody around me is take pride in who you are as a man and who you are as a football player and the job responsibility that you have and what that entails is giving your best every day.And if you don’t, you probably won’t be in this league for long,” he said.The Dallas Cowboys’ playoff hopes are now hanging by a thread. After a 34–26 loss to the Vikings, their chances of reaching the postseason have dropped to under 2%, according to NFL.com. If the Cowboys do miss out, it will mark a second straight year without a playoff appearance.","Dak Prescott says he will not give up till the Cowboys have a firm answer.

Bill Belichick attended a cheerleading competition to support Jordon Hudson

Bill Belichick is known for his stone-faced demeanor, which is exactly why the internet did a double take this weekend. The longtime NFL coach was spotted in Atlanta attending a cheerleading competition to support his girlfriend, Jordon Hudson and he looked noticeably upbeat while doing it. Photos from the event showed Belichick smiling, engaged, and fully present, a rare public sight that quickly sparked conversation online.Belichick was seen cheering from the sidelines as Hudson competed in a cheerleading event in Atlanta over the weekend. Hudson suited up for Code Black, a competitive cheer team she has been part of for months. The event marked another high-level competition for Hudson, who continues to stay active in the cheer world while competing at national events.Belichick stayed close throughout the competition, watching Hudson perform and interacting with people around him. He was dressed casually in a button-down shirt and a Navy submarine hat, blending into the crowd while still drawing attention due to his unmistakable presence.The Atlanta competition wasn’t a one-off appearance for Hudson. She previously competed with Code Black at a Cheer Extreme All-Stars event in Raleigh, continuing a busy stretch of performances.The team’s routines, uniforms, and staging reflected the intensity of competitive cheer, with Hudson clearly locked in as she performed.Photos from the weekend showed Hudson in full cheer uniform, while Belichick stood nearby offering visible support, a dynamic that added to the viral appeal of the moment.Belichick, in his early 70s, and Hudson, 24, have remained a frequent topic of online discussion since their relationship became public. Each appearance tends to spark debate, jokes, and commentary, and the cheer competition was no exception. While some fans found the moment supportive and low-key, others leaned into memes and sarcasm, keeping the discourse firmly in pop-culture territory.For now, Belichick and Hudson appear to be enjoying the offseason together, with the coach continuing to show up in support of her cheer career.

"Bill Gates says: For first time in 25 years, number of child deaths are set to rise; but to be clear, it’s not just the US that’s made cuts; it is that …",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-says-for-first-time-in-25-years-number-of-child-deaths-are-set-to-rise-but-to-be-clear-its-not-just-the-us-thats-made-cuts-it-is-that-/articleshow/125978714.cms,"Global child mortality rates are projected to rise for the first time in 25 years, with an estimated 200,000 additional deaths. Bill Gates attributes this grim reversal to significant cuts in foreign aid by the US and other wealthy nations. He emphasizes the next six months are crucial for securing funding and restoring progress in global health initiatives.

""But to be clear, it’s not just the US that’s made cuts. The UK made cuts, Germany made cuts, and it’s that overall effect that’s going to make this a tough five-year time period.""

“In parts of the world like northern Nigeria, over 10% of the kids die before they reach the age of five. In the US, that number would be well below 1%, and that would mostly be difficulties at the time of birth. Malaria’s been a tough one. The US abruptly fired a lot of people and cut off a lot of money in the first half of the year. So that’s where the bed nets were being handed out, the food was being handed out, TB cases were being detected,”

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

“There were sudden and massive cuts — you just can’t deny that’s led to lots of deaths,”

Why Bill Gates thinks next six months is crucial

“I think the next six months will be very important. It’ll be determined what the Congress’ role is in setting the budgets for global health.

It’ll be determined what these new compacts look like. For the poor countries, do they maintain a level of generosity that can get us back on track? Certainly the U.S. commitment to the global fund was a positive data point. They maintained the huge generosity that they’ve had there, which is very helpful to me as I go to the European countries and say, “Okay, this is a one-for-two match construct.

So please don’t cut this.” That helped me get the cuts in those European numbers to be way less than they would have been.”

“They have aging societies. They of course have pressure to increase their defense budgets. All rich countries have very tight budgets. So that’s why I always make it clear this is less than 1 percent of the budget. When you ask somebody in general, they’ll think it’s quite high, like 5, 10 percent. And no, in the U.S. case, it’s never, never reached 1 percent. The big increase in the U.S. that got us up to almost 1 percent was under President Bush, where he saw that people dying of HIV in Africa — That really wasn’t the golden rule to let those people die when the medicines could be so very, very inexpensive.

Now we have a chance because of the innovation pipeline, to do things that can even more effectively cut deaths.”





Microsoft founder Bill Gates' charitable foundation, the Gates Foundation, has come up with a disturbing forecast concerning child mortality numbers. As stated in a Gates Foundation blog post, for the first time in 25 years, child deaths are expected to increase by 200,000, which is a consequence of reduced aid payments to developing countries initiated by the Trump administration and other wealthy nations. However, Gates clarified US is not the only country doing these cuts. In an interview with The Conversation, Gates said:Gates added.he said, noting that this comes after the global health movement was able to reduce child deaths to half from 10 million annually between 2000 and 2025 due to increased resources like vaccines.When asked about whether he has made progress on the funding front and helping US and other governments to understand the impact that they could have, Gates said:Explaining why a lot of countries follow what the US does on multiple ways, Gates highlighted:","Microsoft founder Bill Gates' charitable foundation, the Gates Foundation, has come up with a disturbing forecast concerning child mortality numbers.

(Image: AP/Jon Super)

Manchester United and Bournemouth played out a thrilling 4-4 draw at Old Trafford, with United squandering the lead three times and missing the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League. Despite United's strong attacking display under Ruben Amorim's management, their defensive vulnerabilities were exposed as Bournemouth repeatedly fought back to secure a point.Amad Diallo opened the scoring for United in the 13th minute, nodding into an empty net after Petrovic failed to properly handle Cunha's header. The hosts displayed their best attacking form of the season but struggled defensively without injured defenders Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt.Antoine Semenyo equalized for Bournemouth against the run of play in the 40th minute, taking advantage of Luke Shaw's weakness to score his first goal since October 3. United regained the lead before halftime through Casemiro's header from a Fernandes corner, aided by a goalkeeping error from Petrovic.The second half saw Bournemouth score twice in seven minutes through Evanilson and Marcus Tavernier. Evanilson struck just 37 seconds after the restart, while Tavernier converted a free-kick from the edge of the area.United maintained their record of not losing a home league game when leading at half-time since May 1984, as Bruno Fernandes scored from a brilliant free-kick and Matheus Cunha capitalized on Adam Smith's defensive error to make it 4-3.Eli Junior Kroupi leveled the score for Bournemouth with six minutes remaining. The visitors nearly claimed victory in stoppage time, but United goalkeeper Senne Lammens denied David Brooks twice.""It was a fun game for everyone at home,"" said Amorim. ""When you win away you should win at home. The performance today was different from the last two at home. The result is the same, it is frustrating but the performance is different.""""It's very difficult to explain because so much happened,"" said Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola. ""I suppose it was entertaining for everyone. Two teams that attacked much better than we defended.""The result extends Bournemouth's winless run to seven games but moves them up to 13th place. United climb to sixth place, ahead of Liverpool on goal difference.This draw continues United's recent struggles at home, following their failure to defeat 10-man Everton and West Ham in previous matches.The match highlighted United's improving attack under Amorim's leadership, with their expensive forward line showing promising signs despite defensive shortcomings.Mbeumo missed a clear opportunity from close range during the second half, while Petrovic made an uncertain save from Cunha's powerful shot as both teams continued to create chances throughout the match.",Manchester United and Bournemouth played out a thrilling 4-4 draw at Old Trafford.

Hockey’s first openly gay pro Brock McGillis explains why HBO’s Heated Rivalry hype could actually make NHL players less likely to come out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/hockeys-first-openly-gay-pro-brock-mcgillis-explains-why-hbos-heated-rivalry-hype-could-actually-make-nhl-players-less-likely-to-come-out/articleshow/125993047.cms,"Heated Rivalry won’t create safer coming-out moments in the NHL, says Brock McGillis (Getty Images and HBO max)

Brock McGillis challenges Heated Rivalry impact on hockey coming out narrative



The debate around visibility in professional hockey has resurfaced, but this time it is driven by fiction colliding with lived reality. As LGBTQ+ stories gain space on major platforms, questions linger about whether representation alone can shift a deeply rooted sports culture. For some, progress feels close. For others, the gap between screen and locker room remains wide.Brock McGillis knows that gap better than most. As the first openly gay professional hockey player, he has spent years navigating conversations that often miss the harder truths. While HBO’s Heated Rivalry has drawn praise and attention, McGillis is clear that popularity does not always equal impact, especially inside a sport he says still struggles with normalized homophobia.McGillis pushed back strongly against claims that the series could encourage NHL players to come out. Speaking to PinkNews, he said he “wholeheartedly” disagrees with former NHL player Sean Avery’s belief that the show opens doors. “It’s probably more likely to have an adverse effect on a player coming out,” McGillis, 42, told the website. “And I hate to be negative because I really enjoy the show. But I also don’t believe that many hockey bros are going to watch it.And I don’t think, if they are watching it, they’re talking about it positively.”The series follows two fictional star players locked in a secret relationship for years. While the storyline has resonated with many viewers, McGillis argues that it risks oversimplifying what real players face. He points to his own experience after coming out in 2016, long after his semi-professional career ended. Despite extensive media coverage, he says the ripple effect never came. “Nobody’s like, ‘Oh, yeah. This came out and now I’m ready [to come out],’ ” McGillis told PinkNews. “It’s not happening.”For McGillis, the core issue is not a lack of stories but the culture surrounding the sport. He describes homophobia as something that “starts at a very young age and progresses,” reinforced daily through language and behavior. Watching Heated Rivalry even stirred personal memories. “Episode one gave me a panic attack,” he said, recalling years spent hiding a relationship. “I dated a guy for three years, not a soul in my life knowing. We had an alias for [me in his phone] in case [his friends] ever saw.”Still, McGillis does not dismiss the show entirely. He believes it could help people around players understand them better. “It might help the people around [players] understand a little more if they’re dating somebody; hopefully,” he said. And despite his criticism, he maintains faith in teammates themselves. “If a player did come out, hockey players would be the most likely to rally around their teammate more than any of the other big sports. ”For now, McGillis remains focused on advocacy, urging the sport to confront its realities head-on rather than leaning on fiction to do the work.Also Read: Sidney Crosby sounds alarm after Penguins blow multi-goal lead again, this time against Utah Mammoth",Brock McGillis is the first openly gay professional hockey player.

MUMBAI:

Smriti Mandhana opens up on 'love', World Cup win and more

At a time when she has just gone through turmoil in her personal turmoil after calling off her wedding, Smriti Mandhana would perhaps be heartened by the fact that the Indian women's team's head coach Amol Muzumdar too is a huge fan of her fabulous batting skills.At a function to felicitate him at the Bombay Gymkhana on Monday evening, Muzumdar, who coached India to their maiden ODI World Cup win in Nov, confessed that he was a big fan of Mandhana, known for her prowess on the off-side.""Smriti is the best left-hander I've ever seen. Her cover drive is beautiful, elegant. There's a touch of class in her cover drive,"" Muzumdar said, showering praise on India's vice-captain and superstar batter.The Mumbaikar admitted that he endured ""sleepless nights"" before India's must-win match against New Zealand at the DY Patil Stadium- a match which India won by 53 runs (via the DLD method) to survive in the World Cup. Terming it as India's ""turning point"" of the tournament. ""I think that the New Zealand game gave me more... Before the New Zealand game, there were a couple of sleepless nights. Because that was a must-win game.It was like a quarter-final. So if we win the game, we're getting into the semi-finals,"" he said.He termed Jemimah Rodrigues ' match-winning 127-run knock in the semifinals as ""phenomenal.""""We as a team always believed that if we had to win the World Cup, we'd have to beat Australia somewhere down the line. Either in the semi-finals or in the finals. So, we were all geared up for that game. There was no doubt about it. But Jemima's knock was a phenomenal knock,"" he complimented.Muzumdar admitted that as the head coach of the team, he did have some stern words to say to the team after they lost to England from a winning position at Indore to suffer their third consecutive defeat during the World Cup. ""There are times when you leave it for another day, to get a picture of certain things. There are times when you speak as a coach. When as a coach, you have to make the decision and tell them there and then what had happened, and I decided for the latter. You have to press on the nerve that's hurting. If it hurts, then we perform better,"" he said.Muzumdar said that he imbibed in the players a sense of ""accountability,"" something that he learnt from the coaches that he played under in Mumbai. ""All that I learnt from every coach that I played under in Mumbai and I grabbed a few things from each coach.. and I think it was about accountability for players. And I still have inculcated that in this Indian women's team that you've got to be accountable for your own performances and your team's performance, the players are responsible and accountable for it. So I think it's been an incredible journey for the last two years, seeing this Indian women's team lift the World Cup,"" he said.He explained that the decision to drop middle-order batter Jemimah Rodrigues for a few matches during the tournament was taken in the team's interest. ""About the picking and dropping of players, it's a simple golden rule for me that if it is a cricketing decision, I'll go ahead and do it. It's always been team first. That's been the culture of Mumbai cricket where I've grown. The Maidan cricket which have given me my lessons, my cricketing lessons. If it's a cricketing decision, then you go ahead and do it and be firm on that decision,"" he said.Muzumdar, who has coached at the Rajasthan Royals and was the head of the Mumbai men's team in the past, felt that it was easier to ""handle"" the women's team in comparison to the men's side. ""I felt handling the men's team is much more difficult than handling the women's team. And these are incredible, skillful players in this Indian women's cricket team at the moment. Not just that, but they are terrific human beings. And that is what has brought the success to this team. And honestly speaking, in the last two years, it's been a great education for me, being around with these girls,"" he gushed.Hailing the camaraderie in the Indian women's team, he said, ""I've handled many teams, I've been involved with many teams before as a player and as a coach. But I haven't seen such a cohesive unit than this one. And I'm really glad that I was a small part in these last two years and being with them day in, day out. They worked terribly hard. Unbelievable sacrifices that they've made. Two years, superb dedication. One thing which I really observed with this Indian women's cricket team is that if you give them instruction, they will follow it to the “T”. Only and only if they trust you.""Winning the World Cup as an India coach is naturally now the biggest highlight of Muzumdar's career. ""I think without a doubt when Harmanpreet Kaur (Indian women's team captain) lifted that World Cup, it was a surreal moment. I don't think it will get any better and bigger than that,"" he said.","Amol Muzumdar says Smriti Mandhana is the best left-hander he's ever seen.

Sean McVay did not stay long after the Rams’ win as a personal moment took over

The noise inside Ford Field was still settling when Sean McVay’s night quietly changed direction. The Los Angeles Rams had just secured a 41–34 win over the Detroit Lions, a result that locked in a playoff berth and capped off an intense road performance. For most coaches, that moment would bring media obligations, locker room speeches, and a brief pause to absorb what the win meant.McVay chose otherwise. As celebrations unfolded, urgency replaced routine. According to Fox Sports NFL insider Jay Glazer, the Rams head coach was already thinking beyond football. “Sean McVay, big win against the Lions right here, but how about this?” Glazer reported. “He tells me he's actually going to leave the stadium, head home, pick up his wife Veronika, head to the hospital for the birth of their second son. ”The playoff spot mattered, but the most important moment of McVay’s night was waiting under hospital lights. His wife, Veronika, was in labor, and no professional milestone could compete with that reality. The decision to leave immediately was not dramatic or symbolic. It was instinctive. Family came first.McVay has spoken before about how becoming a father reshaped his sense of perspective. When their first son, Jordan John McVay, was born, the coach described an experience that cut through all preparation and expectation.“Everybody kind of tells you what to expect, and it couldn't even be as good as everybody says,” McVay said. “And they certainly talked about what a special moment it was. Just amazing how well my wife handled it and what a stud she was throughout that whole process. ”The words still stand out for their honesty. There was no performance in them, only respect. Only a football coach would use the word “stud,” but the meaning was unmistakable. It reflected admiration for strength he could never fully understand, only witness.Veronika McVay rarely seeks attention, yet moments like this highlight her central place in Sean McVay’s life away from the field. She anchors the part of his world that does not reset every Sunday. As the Rams prepare for the postseason, the focus will return to football. But for one night in Detroit, the game ended early, and something far more personal took its place.Also read: Travis Hunter and Jalen Hurts height comparison: Which NFL star stands taller?","Sean McVay left the field after the Los Angeles Rams' 41–34 win over the Detroit Lions.

Looking forward to AmFest this week. Time to get back to work.”In a separate update on X, Candace Owens echoed the message, describing their hours-long meeting as exceeding her expectations in terms of agreement.“Erika and I had an extremely productive 4 1/2 hour meeting that I think we both feel should have taken place a lot earlier than it did,” Owens said. “We agreed much more than I had anticipated.

Most importantly, we were able to share intel and clarify intent.”Critics have accused Owens of peddling conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk’s assassination. Owens added that the conversation immediately helped ease tensions and said she would provide further updates on Tuesday.“I will of course have a full rundown for you all tomorrow as I am currently exhausted, but I wanted to quickly let you guys know that absolutely nothing was held back and the immediate result was that tensions were thawed,” Owens said.The discussion represents a bid by both women to address weeks of online conspiracy-related tensions following Charlie Kirk’s assassination.","Turning Point USA CEO Erika Kirk had a ""productive meeting"" with Candace Owens, signalling a possible thaw in their rift.

Ilia Topuria domestic violence allegations spark explosive response from Bryce Mitchell



Ilia Topuria UFC leave explained as champion denies allegations and cites extortion



Tension around the UFC lightweight title intensified this week after Ilia Topuria confirmed a pause in his fighting schedule. The speculation about his career shifted quickly into a serious public dispute involving personal allegations and legal claims. The situation has drawn attention far beyond the cage, placing the undefeated champion at the center of one of the sport’s most volatile moments this year.As Topuria stepped away to address matters that he says threaten his family and reputation, a former rival chose a very different response. Bryce Mitchell resurfaced with a blistering message that reignited their history and added fuel to an already heated conversation across the MMA world.Bryce Mitchell, who lost to Ilia Topuria at UFC 282, posted a video that mixed personal grievance with harsh condemnation. Referencing past mockery, he escalated his criticism with graphic language and accusations tied to the allegations surrounding Topuria’s absence.“Remember when I fought Ilia, he won, and then afterwards, he got a pair of overalls and was making fun of me, because I run a farm and I run around in overalls, and he thought that was hilarious? Well, I got something for you,” Mitchell said before continuing, “This is called the ‘Wife Beater Special.’That’s right. I got my wife beater on for Ilia Topuria. That b*tch puts his hands on a woman.”Mitchell framed his anger through personal history and values, adding, “I grew up without a dad, never seen my dad, never will see my dad. And you know what? I’d rather not see my dad than have my dad there beating on my mom.” He warned, “Let me tell you something, that’ll get you killed around these parts, son.”The rant continued with Mitchell blending condemnation and religion. “But anyways, bro, who am I to judge? I fall short of the glory of God, too,” he said. “Ilia, you need to repent, return to Jesus Christ… and probably stop drinking, too.”Topuria addressed the situation directly through a detailed public statement, explaining that domestic violence allegations from his ex-wife prompted his decision to step away from the octagon. “This was not a decision I took lightly,” he wrote. “However, when circumstances arise that threaten your personal integrity, your family, and your reputation, there comes a point when you must address them directly. ”He denied all claims and described what he called an extortion attempt. “In recent months, I have been subjected to severe and unacceptable pressure, including threats to disseminate false allegations of domestic abuse unless financial demands were met.” Topuria added, “These allegations are entirely unfounded. The truth is not a matter of opinion – it is a matter of evidence.”According to Topuria, evidence has already been submitted to judicial authorities, including recordings, written communications, witness statements, and video material. “My initial decision to remain silent was made solely to protect my children,” he explained, before concluding, “Out of respect for my children and the ongoing legal proceedings, I will not be making any further public statements.”With Topuria sidelined, the UFC plans to move forward with an interim lightweight title bout between Justin Gaethje and Paddy Pimblett at UFC 324 in Las Vegas. The champion’s return timeline remains uncertain.Also Read: Why Ilia Topuria is stepping away from the UFC and putting his title defense on hold?
