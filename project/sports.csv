D Gukesh

win?

Indian chess prodigy D Gukesh, 18, secured the World Chess Championship title on Thursday when he beat reigning champion Ding Liren in Singapore. He achieved this victory by clinching the last and final classical game.Announcing the development, the International Chess Federation (FIDE) announced on X that Gukesh had become ""the YOUNGEST WORLD CHAMPION in history"". This followed Ding's resignation in a gripping endgame that many anticipated would conclude in a draw.Overcome with emotion, Gukesh burst into tears , burying his face in his hands upon realising his new title.Liren, 32, slumped over the table after noticing a critical endgame blunder. This mistake provided Gukesh with the winning opportunity.The viewing rooms near the playing arena erupted in cheers. Jubilant fans, comprising many Indians who had travelled to witness the match and local Singaporeans of Indian descent, celebrated Gukesh's victory.Gukesh's win surpasses the previous record held by Russia's Garry Kasparov, who claimed the title at 22. Gukesh has achieved this feat at the age of 18.He has become the second Indian to hold the World Chess Championship title, following in the footsteps of five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand Gukesh's victory in game 14 resulted in a final score of 7.5 against Ding's 6.5. This cemented his exceptional rise to chess stardom. He had already become the youngest-ever challenger for the world championship.Each classical game victory in the $2.5 million World Chess Championship 2024 was worth $200,000 (approximately Rs 1.69 crore). By winning three games, Gukesh pocketed $600,000 (approx Rs 5.07 crore) outrightly. Liren, by winning two games, won $400,000 (approx Rs 3.38 crore).The remaining $1.5 million in prize money will be split equally between the two opponents.That would take Gukesh's prize money to $1.35 million (approx Rs 11.45 crore) and $1.15 million (approx Rs 9.75 crore) for Liren.","Gukesh's win surpasses the previous record held by Russia's Garry Kasparov, who claimed the title at 22.

Vinod Kambli Refuses To Let Go: Emotional Reunion With Sachin Tendulkar In Mumbai

Vinod Kambli Exclusive | Alcoholism | Rehab | Shane Warne | #TheVickeyLalwaniShow

For the first time since sparking concern at the Ramakant Achrekar memorial event a few weeks ago, former India cricketer Vinod Kambli has spoken about his recent health scare and reflected on his long-standing friendship with Sachin Tendulkar Kambli, 52, revealed that he has been battling a severe urine infection that led to his collapse a month ago. His family - wife Andrea, son Jesus Cristiano, and daughter Johanna - played a crucial role in his recovery.""I am better now. My wife takes care of me a lot. She took me to three different hospitals and told me, 'You have to get fit.' My son picked me up when I collapsed, and my daughter and wife stood by me throughout. The doctor told me to get admitted,"" Kambli shared during an interview with Vickey Lalwani on YouTube.Despite his struggles, Kambli remains determined to recover fully. ""I'm ready to go to rehab. I want to go there because I don't fear anything. My family is with me,"" he said, expressing gratitude for their unwavering support.Kambli's appearance at the Achrekar memorial event, where his visibly frail condition and emotional reunion with Tendulkar went viral, reignited conversations about their storied friendship. The duo famously forged a world-record 664-run partnership in a school match in 1988 and went on to represent India together.However, their relationship hit a rough patch in 2009 when Kambli publicly suggested that Tendulkar could have done more to help him during his struggles. Addressing the controversy after 15 years, Kambli clarified that his remarks were born out of frustration.""At that time, it came to my mind that Sachin didn't help. I was extremely frustrated. But Sachin did everything for me, including paying for my two surgeries in 2013. We spoke, and childhood friendship came forward,"" Kambli explained.Tendulkar's gesture of covering Kambli's medical expenses and their interactions at the Achrekar memorial event underscore the enduring bond between the two. ""Sachin told me how to play. I made nine comebacks. We are cricketers; we get hurt. When we get out, we also get hurt,"" Kambli added.Reflecting on his cricketing journey, Kambli acknowledged the highs and lows. A prodigious talent, he burst onto the scene in the early 1990s, becoming the first Indian to score back-to-back double centuries in Test cricket. His knock of 224 against England at Wankhede remains one of his cherished memories.""The double hundred at Wankhede, I will cherish the most. Achrekar sir was with me, and we had such a great team. I used to have fun battles with Muttiah Muralitharan and our other opponents,"" Kambli recalled.Despite his early success, Kambli's career was marred by inconsistency and off-field issues. He played his last Test in 1996 and ODI in 2000, finishing with a respectable Test average of 54.20 and 1084 runs including four centuries from 17 matches.Kambli's story remains one of unfulfilled potential, but his candid reflections and resilience in the face of adversity continue to inspire. ""My journey wasn't perfect, but I gave it my all. I'm grateful for the support of my family and friends like Sachin,"" he said.",Former India cricketer Vinod Kambli has spoken about his recent health scare and reflected on his long-standing friendship with Sachin Tendulkar.

Former Australian fast bowler Jason Gillespie has stepped down as head coach of Pakistan's Test team, citing frustrations with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). The PCB confirmed his resignation on Thursday, adding to the growing turmoil within the national cricket setup.In a statement, the PCB said: ""The PCB has named former Pakistan paceman Aaqib Javed as interim red-ball head coach following the resignation of Jason Gillespie."" Javed, already serving as the interim white-ball coach after Gary Kirsten’s departure in October, will now lead Pakistan in the two-Test series in South Africa starting December 26 in Centurion.Gillespie's resignation reportedly stemmed from a series of disagreements with the PCB, particularly following the board's decision not to renew the contract of his assistant, Tim Nielsen. Speaking during Pakistan's Test series against England, Gillespie hinted at his frustrations. ""I think there's always frustrations from time to time. It wasn't what I signed up for, I'll be completely honest,"" he told Sky Sports.The PCB's statement emphasized their focus on continuity amid the transition, with Javed's appointment aimed at ensuring stability during the South Africa tour. ""Aaqib Javed's first assignment as red-ball head coach will be the two-match Test series against South Africa during the ongoing all-format tour,"" the statement read.Gillespie's tenure saw mixed results. After a humiliating 0-2 whitewash against Bangladesh and an innings defeat to England, Pakistan rebounded to claim a 2-1 Test series victory against England on sharply turning tracks. Despite this success, Gillespie was removed from the selection panel, further straining his relationship with the PCB.His resignation mirrors that of Gary Kirsten, Pakistan's white-ball coach, who stepped down in October under similar circumstances. The PCB's frequent coaching changes - six different head coaches in four years - have drawn criticism for undermining long-term stability.The Pakistan team is currently in South Africa for a T20I and ODI series ahead of the Tests.

LeBron James will be absent for the Lakers game against Minnesota Timberwolves



The soreness in his left foot has now sidelined LeBron James for a second straight game. After a four-day break, the Los Angeles Lakers confirmed that James would not participate in Friday's contest against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Earlier this week, James took personal leave, and his participation in this game against Minnesota remains undecided. This is the second game so far this season that James has missed as a result of his foot injury.LeBron James is reportedly out with soreness in his left foot for another game.James is out with left foot soreness after missing his first game of the season on Sunday. Initially listed as probable, he was ruled doubtful at the final hour, and thirty minutes before tipoff, could not find his name anywhere on the list.The Lakers won against the Portland Trail Blazers with a final score of 107-98 as D'Angelo Russell scored 28 points while dishing out 14 assists and Rui Hachimura came through with 23 points and 4 steals to go along with Anthony Davis' incredible 30 balls, 11 boards, and five blocks. The last time he played, James was one of those first 23 games played and is currently averaging 23.The Lakers head coach JJ Redick previously shared that James ""is taking some time"" from Lakers practice amid his extended break citing ""personal reasons."" James missed Sunday’s game against Portland due to left foot soreness. His status for Friday’s game against Minnesota will be another miss for the NBA veteran.Coach Redick noted before the game that the time off could benefit James, adding that the extended break in the early season ""could be really good for him."" Afterward, Redick encouraged the rest of the Lakers to make the most of the break. ""Heck, if somebody wants to go spend a couple of nights in Santa Barbara and relax, that's fine too,"" Redick said adding, ""It's a quarter way through the season.""""In game, he's asked for a sub a couple times because he's gassed,"" Redick said Wednesday. ""For us, we have to be cognizant as we play more and more games, just the cumulative effect of playing a lot of minutes, and Sunday, being banged up with the foot thing, it felt like a good opportunity for him to get some rest.""Redick further shared that he has had regular conversations with both James and Anthony Davis about the Lakers’ focus on staying mentally tough during challenging periods. “Honestly, both of them have taken ownership. They’re the leaders of the team on the court. I had a great conversation with LeBron last week about the way he played in Miami and Atlanta, beyond just the stats, but the way he played, the way he led.

Newly crowned chess world champion D Gukesh responded to critiques regarding the quality of his World Chess Championship match against Ding Liren .He emphasised that victory in high-stakes matches isn't solely determined by gameplay. He believes willpower and character are equally crucial, qualities he feels he amply demonstrated.At 18, Gukesh defeated Liren in the 14-game world championship match, scoring 7.5-6.5. This victory makes him the youngest world champion in chess history.Former world champions Magnus Carlsen and Vladimir Kramnik expressed their disappointment with the quality of play displayed during the championship match, which concluded on Thursday.Carlsen remarked that the match resembled ""a second round or third round match of an open tournament.""Kramnik's assessment was even more critical, stating that the match represented the ""end of chess as we know it.""Asked if he was hurt by Carlsen's comments, Gukesh told BBC World, ""Not really"".Gukesh acknowledged the validity of some of the criticisms regarding the quality of play. However, he underscored the importance of non-chess factors in determining the outcome of a world championship match.""I get that maybe in some of the games, the quality was not high but I think the world championship matches are decided not purely by chess but by who has the better character and who has the better willpower. And I think those qualities, I did show quite well.""While acknowledging the pressure of the world championship, Gukesh admitted he aspired to a higher level of play. He recognised the unique demands of such a high-profile competition.""And the pure chess part, it was not at a very high level as I would have liked it to be because it's a new experience for me.

He suggested that such mistakes add to the excitement of the sport.Indian chess legend Viswanathan Anand offered his congratulations to Gukesh. He advised the young champion to disregard the criticism.""I feel very happy. I was literally watching history being made yesterday. It (criticism) comes with every match.

IND vs AUS: 'I always play percentage cricket' - Rishabh Pant to Ravi Shastri in Brisbane,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/i-always-play-percentage-cricket-rishabh-pant-to-ravi-shastri-in-brisbane/articleshow/116305864.cms,"Rishabh Pant (Getty Images)

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant etched his name in cricketing folklore with his remarkable innings during India's historic triumph at the Gabba in January 2021. Chasing a daunting target of 328 runs on a deteriorating pitch against a formidable Australian bowling attack, Pant's unbeaten 89 off 138 balls showcased his audacious stroke play, fearless temperament, and uncanny ability to thrive under pressure.Pant, batting at number five, arrived with the game delicately poised. His counter-attacking approach against the likes of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, and Nathan Lyon turned the tide in India's favour.From reverse-sweeping Lyon to punching Cummins through the off-side, Pant's innings was a masterclass in calculated aggression.This iconic knock not only led India to a 2-1 series win but also cemented Pant's reputation as a match-winner and one of the finest finishers in modern Test cricket.With Pant once again arriving at the iconic venue for the third Test against Australia, the left-hander recalled that historic moment.Pant was involved in a car accident in December 2022, which forced the Indian star to undergo a lengthy recovery phase. He returned to the field during the IPL 2024 and kept wickets effectively during the tournament. Pant made a great return with the bat in Tests and has also been secure with the gloves.Speaking to Ravi Shastri ahead of the Brisbane Test, Pant said that he talked to his doctors and made sure that he could be fully fit as he always wanted to keep in Tests for India.""It's amazing, when I entered (The Gabba) I got a positive feeling. It gives a positive attitude and confidence in a series where things are level, it makes you want to do well. Playing the situation has been a learning for me, bailing out the team from a hard situation. Sometimes it's hard, most of the time I need to keep telling myself to think positive,"" Pant said.""There are easy ways to do it but that's where I put my foot down and keep doing the same thing that has given me a lot of success. Generally I don't practice such (unorthodox sweep and scoop) shots, it's a game-plan according to the bowlers because it's not always easy to just defend the ball. My mindset tells me it's safer, I always play percentage cricket,"" he said.""(Wicket-keeping after his accident) Definitely it was one of the most challenging parts but I made sure with all the doctors that I could be fully fit, I always wanted to keep. The ball travels much more (in Australia), that is something to look for. It does a bit off the wicket but that is part and parcel of the game,"" the wicketkeeper-batter said.","Rishabh Pant's innings at the Gabba cemented his reputation as a match-winner.

Stephen Curry revealed his retirement plans

Nothing lasts forever. Stephen Curry has a stunning career to his name and the Golden State Warriors star is still making his impact on the court with stunning performances. Curry is now 36 and the point guard believes that it is high time to give some thought to his retirement plans. In a recent interview, he has opened up about the same while reflecting on his potential plans with the Warriors after his retirement.Is Stephen Curry retiring? The Golden State Warriors star still has a few years in his sleeves as his performance is still intact. However, the 36-year-old has recently reflected on his retirement plans during his interview with The Circuit of Emily Chang. “There are two ways to go out in basketball: either you’re forced out or you go out on your own terms,” Curry said.“I hope to be in a situation where you consider how your body feels, what it takes to get ready for games, and the offseason training that goes into preparing yourself for an 82-game season,” Curry who already claimed the NBA’s legendary status, added.As the Warriors legend mentioned two scenarios, he hopes to have the second scenario for his retirement to hang up his sneakers with grace. “I don’t want to be the one that’s limping up and down the court trying to keep up with the young bucks,” he shared.Although he is not planning any immediate retirement, Curry believes that “There will be a clear sign when it’s time to hang it up.” But he is going strong and he feels his body and mind are aligning to keep him up at his games, “But I don’t think I’m anywhere close to that yet,” he added.Acknowledging the inevitable, Curry previously stated that he would love to remain with the Warriors till the end of his time on the court. “I hope so, for sure,” he previously said in his appearance on Today show when asked about his future plans with the team.Inherently, there has been an emotional connection built over the years as he accomplished most of his accolades playing for the team. “I always said it’s a goal of mine to finish my career with that organization that has seen me go through the ranks and accomplish amazing things with Draymond (Green) and I know Klay (Thompson) is not with us anymore. But I want to keep winning, obviously. And I know we have hopefully some days ahead to keep doing that. So I definitely want to be there,” he shared.Also Read: Ayesha Curry Reveals EMBARRASSING Stephen Curry Story After Annoying Remark The 2024-25 season marks Stephen Curry's 16th year in the NBA.

Has Brisbane weather misled Rohit Sharma into bowling first in the Gabba Test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/has-brisbane-weather-misled-rohit-sharma-into-bowling-first-in-the-gabba-test/articleshow/116306683.cms,"Photo Credit: @cricketcomau on X

The overcast and rainy conditions in Brisbane might have made the decision to bowl first an obvious one, which is what India captain Rohit Sharma did after winning the toss in the third Test against Australia, but the first few overs had a story to tell.Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj kept searching for the swing that the conditions promised, only to find none present as the Australian openers -- Nathan McSweeney and Usman Khawaja -- didn't face any trouble in negotiating the threat with the new ball until rain made its first interruption on Saturday morning at The Gabba .""First five overs, the Indian bowlers were searching for that swing. If the ball is swinging, you have to bowl a leg-stump line,"" said former India batter and batting coach Sanjay Bangar while speaking on Star Sports.Whatever little assistance was available in the opening hour, it was off the pitch; and the Indian bowlers adjusted their lines accordingly after resumption of play.""When they came back, they were impressive and disciplined in the next 8 overs,"" Bangar added.The Indian pacers shifted towards a fifth-stump line. However, Khawaja (19*) and McSweeney (4*) stuck to Australia's Adelaide plans of seeing off Bumrah, while taking their chances against the other bowlers to take the total to 28 for 0 in 13.2 overs before rain stopped play again.Former England captain Michael Vaughan suggested that it was a good toss to lose for the Autralians as the ball didn't swing and the pitch didn't show any extravagant bounce and carry to trouble the batters.""Inside 4 overs and it looks like a lovely Toss to have lost...,"" Vaughan wrote on X.India's decision to bowl first could also be influenced by the fact that the visitors' batting hasn't fired consistently so far in the series, with three of their four innings folding for under 200 runs. And considering the overcast conditions and the expected bounce in the Gabba deck, maybe Rohit didn't want to hand the Australians an early advantage.India made two changes to their eleven -- bringing in Akash Deep to replace fellow pacer Harshit Rana, while Ravichandran Ashwin made way for Ravindra Jadeja.The five-Test Border Gavaskar Trophy is currently level at 1-1, with India winning the first Test in Perth by 295 runs and Australia coming back to win by 10-wickets in the pink-ball Test at Adelaide.","India captain Rohit Sharma won the toss and decided to bowl first in the third Test against Australia at The Gabba.

At just 18 years old, D Gukesh has become the youngest and the 18th chess World Champion , defeating reigning title holder Ding Liren of China. This victory makes him India’s second world champion after Viswanathan Anand , who won five titles before conceding the crown to Magnus Carlsen in 2013. It’s a story that feels almost scripted, yet it is real — a tale of audacious dreams, relentless hard work, and unwavering support.In the press conference after his victory, Gukesh said, “I’m living my dream.” For many of us who have followed his journey, this is no exaggeration. I vividly remember an 11-year-old Gukesh, in a chat with Sagar Shah of ChessBase India, joyfully declaring his ambition: to become the youngest world chess champion . It’s a powerful reminder that setting bold goals and dedicating yourself to them can lead to extraordinary outcomes.Behind Gukesh’s victory is a story of immense sacrifice — especially from his parents . Garry Kasparov’s congratulatory post captures this sentiment beautifully: “My congratulations to D Gukesh on his victory today. He has summitted the highest peak of all: making his mother happy!” This line resonates deeply, as Kasparov himself has often spoken about the sacrifices his own mother made to support his chess career.In India, where parents traditionally prioritise academics over everything else, Gukesh’s parents dared to do differently. They chose to believe in their son’s talent, putting aside societal expectations and their own comforts to ensure he could pursue his passion.As a parent myself, this strikes a chord. Watching Gukesh’s triumph is a reminder of what parenting can be. Whether it’s chess, dance, or math, children deserve the freedom and encouragement to follow their dreams. Who knows what they might achieve if we let go of conventional ideas of success and simply support them?Gukesh’s victory also symbolises India’s growth as a sporting nation. Even a decade ago, the infrastructure, resources, and mindset needed to nurture a champion like him didn’t exist. Today, academies like WACA (WestBridge Anand Chess Academy), backed by a venture capital fund, play a pivotal role in shaping young talent. Supporting an elite chess player is no small feat — it requires constant funding, world-class training, and a network of top-tier seconds, coaches, and trainers.Gukesh’s winning team, which he proudly declared and thanked in the post-game press conference, includes some of the biggest names in the chess world: Grzegorz Gajewski, Radoslaw Wojtaszek, Pentala Harikrishna, Jan-Krzysztof Duda, Paddy Upton, and others. Such expertise doesn’t come cheap, and this ecosystem represents a combination of global excellence and Indian vision, underscoring the progress we’ve made as a nation in supporting sports.Beyond his game, what makes Gukesh remarkable is his maturity and authenticity. His calmness and emotional intelligence at the press conference were awe-inspiring for someone so young. As he answered questions with poise and humility , I couldn’t help but marvel at how grounded he is. Honestly, I’d love to know who trained him in PR and public speaking — his communication skills are as impressive as his chess!In the final moments of Game 14, nearly at the end, Ding made a one-move blunder in an otherwise drawn game, (55.Rf2, an offer for a rook trade), and commentators around the world jumped off their seats in disbelief. Commotion and celebration broke out across live streams, yet Gukesh remained straight-faced. Ultra calm, he studied the position, took a sip of water, and coolly traded rooks. He knew he was winning but displayed monk-like composure, holding back any visible excitement.Moments later, after further trading bishops and gaining a decisive pawn advantage, Gukesh finally allowed himself a smile, realising he had secured the championship. But even in this moment of triumph, his respect for the game and his opponent stood out. As Ding contemplated his resignation, Gukesh rose from his chair and turned away, ensuring his reaction wouldn’t come across as disrespectful.His regard for Ding’s spirit was evident in the post-game press conference, where he praised the Chinese GM's resilience and fighting spirit throughout the match.With humility, Gukesh even attributed part of his victory to the opponent, saying: “Ding Liren is the real inspiration to me. What I learned from Ding is what an incredible fighter he is—true champions fight until the very end.”And then, there was that raw, emotional moment when Ding Liren resigned . Gukesh’s face contorted with a mix of laughter and tears, reminding me of Kamal Haasan’s iconic scenes where he does both at once. Except this wasn’t acting — this was pure, unfiltered emotion. For a billion Indians rooting for his win, it was a moment of collective pride and joy.What truly sets Gukesh apart is his cultural confidence. In a world where many young people chase trends and pop culture, Gukesh remains unapologetically himself. He meditates with closed eyes before matches, wears a tripundra or vibhuti on his forehead, and after his victory, he touched the chessboard and his eyes—a traditional Hindu gesture of gratitude. His ability to stay grounded while excelling on the global stage sends a powerful message: you can embrace your roots and still be a global champion.Gukesh’s story isn’t just about chess. It’s about parenting, perseverance, and India’s transformation. It’s about staying true to yourself while reaching for the stars. Most of all, it’s about believing — in your children, in your dreams, and in the idea that greatness can come from anywhere.",D Gukesh became the youngest world chess champion at 18 years after beating Ding Liren of China. This victory makes him India’s second world champion after Viswanathan Anand.

Champions Trophy in PAK: More drama as Jay Shah strongly objects PCB's PoK plans

NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Committee (ICC) is likely to put the final stamp on the proposed hybrid model for the upcoming Champions Trophy in February on Saturday.

Indications are India will play Pakistan in Colombo during the ICC T20 World Cup in 2026, which will be jointly hosted by India and Sri Lanka. For the women's World Cup to be hosted in India next year, an alternate venue will be discussed for Pakistan to play their matches.During the upcoming Champions Trophy, Dubai is set to be the venue for the final with Pakistan hosting 10 matches and a semifinal. ""One may expect ICC to announce the venue and fixtures after the meeting on Saturday. As it was discussed in a meeting on December 5, hybrid model for the Champions Trophy is the most feasible option. ICC is likely to accept PCB's request, and India is unlikely to host Pakistan teams till 2027,"" an ICC source told TOI on Friday.PCB had asked for monetary compensation for agreeing to the hybrid model.They had suggested a greater percentage in ICC's revenue sharing model. TOI understands that the ICC board members are not agreeable to the demand and PCB isn't likely to get any sizeable financial compensation outside the logistical costs of hosting the tournament in two countries.However, there's a chance that PCB could be awarded another ICC event to host in lieu of the hybrid model agreement.",ICC likely to put the final stamp on the proposed hybrid model for the upcoming Champions Trophy in February.

Border-Gavaskar Trophy: India vs Australia 3rd Test: Can Virat Kohli inspire a turnaround at Gabba?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/india-vs-australia-3rd-test-can-virat-kohli-inspire-a-turnaround-at-gabba/articleshow/116271477.cms,"IN SEARCH OF OLD SELF: Watching Virat Kohli during practice at The Gabba on Thursday showed his eagerness to rediscover the poise and decisiveness of youth.

The star batter, who has played just one Test in Brisbane without reward back in 2014, is fussing over his technique, putting in the hard yards & rallying the rest as India seek batting edge in crucial third Test...

IND vs AUS: India batting has been a major cause of worry

This Virat Kohli is like Sachin Tendulkar of 2011-13

BRISBANE: Step out of the Queensland Cricketers' Club members dining area and there's a unique vantage point right above the Gabba nets, offering a bird's eye view of the proceedings below.For those watching from here, through the four intense hours that India's top six sweated it out in sweltering heat and alarming UV levels, it was clear this batting unit is trying extremely hard to get its act together following the shellacking in Adelaide.Everybody, from KL Rahul to Rohit Sharma , put in the hard yards on Thursday but it was Virat Kohli who perfectly epitomized this renewed focus. He was a bundle of batting energy, hopping from one net to the other, facing pace, then more pace, fronting up against spin before spending a long time working on his technique and body position while facing throwdowns from the sidearm, or 'throwdown stick' as the Aussies call it.Kohli seemed a man on a mission even before hitting the hits, giving a long pep talk to the youngsters along with vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah , getting in some decent slip-catching practice before going deep within himself to iron out some perceived flaws.It was like watching a past master's frantic attempts to clear the cobwebs of the mind, to try and rediscover the poise and decisiveness of youth. Kohli is still very fit and far from being a spent force, of course. He has already done his bit as the series hits the halfway stage, having hit a century as India won in Perth. But he knows a decisive knock or two under pressure is what the team needs most from him.It is here, at the Gabba, with India on the ropes, that Kohli will be itching to contribute. He has played just once here and not done well. He knows the team is staring at either an early transition, or a delayed one if veterans like him and Rohit Sharma can rage against the dying of the light a bit longer. The transition will happen, nonetheless.For the moment, in the here and now, the spotlight is firmly on them. After the Perth ton, Kohli had said, ""I'm not the sort of guy who wants to hang around just for the sake of it. I just want to contribute to the team's cause.""In Perth, Kohli enjoyed the cushion of runs, with India already 321 ahead when he came out to the middle. He didn't have that cushion in Adelaide and faltered.In Perth, Kohli had the time to get his eye in before unleashing a range of strokes when he realized the team was waiting for him to get to three figures before declaring. In Adelaide, he was caught in two minds whether to reach out to a Mitchell Starc delivery, play or leave, and paid the price. In his second stint it was Scott Boland and again that nagging length, and the star batsman only managed to edge it to the 'keeper.In recent times, Kohli has had a tendency to commit on the front foot, but in Perth he used the depth of the crease well against the likes of Nathan Lyon. In the Brisbane nets on Thursday, he faced problems against deliveries just short of full length, playing and missing or edging against the likes of Jasprit Bumrah, Akash Deep and Mukesh Kumar.Lately, Kohli has found surprising ways to get out, like the Mitchell Santner full toss during the home series against New Zealand. Is it an eyesight thing? Are the trigger movements slow er? Only Kohli would know for sure, but it's possible to draw a distinct line at the point where the consistency starts to taper off—for someone who averaged 54.97 from 2011-19 and scored 27 Test tons, the years from 2020 till date have fetched him only three centuries and an average of 32.14. That's a steep decline, although he has still been impressive overseas of late.Kohli, then, has to break new ground at the Gabba, but he's not the only one. In India's last five Tests, against Australia here and New Zealand at home, the whole top six has collectively averaged a poor 27.47. Take just the last seven overseas Tests, and their collective average rises to 35.39. In Australia so far, across the two Tests, the top six averages only 28.13 across 24 innings, in spite of centuries from Yashasvi Jaiswal and Kohli.To make a strong comeback here, this team must find that elusive quality of consistency. Simply put, India must bat long. As Rohit Sharma had said after the defeat in the pink-ball Test, ""When you come to Australia the best chance of winning a Test match is by putting runs on the board."" Can Kohli inspire a top-six turnaround?","Virat Kohli has played just one Test in Brisbane without reward back in 2014. The star batter is fussing over his technique, putting in the hard yards & rallying the rest as India seek batting edge in crucial third Test. In India's last five Tests against Australia and New Zealand, the whole top six has collectively averaged 2747.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116271440,imgsize-44286,width-400,resizemode-4/116271440.jpg"

Vishy Anand

as heading for draw, defending champ buckles

'Gukesh's face told me I had just made a blunder'

Caissa, the chess goddess, smiled on D Gukesh on Thursday. He thanked her in return. The world championship crown, the one Magnus Carlsen took away from Viswanathan Anand in Chennai in 2013, is returning to India - the birthplace of chess.At 18, Gukesh is the youngest world champion the chess world has ever seen, the first teenager to wear the crown. Garry Kasparov , who held the record till Thursday evening, was 22 when he ascended the throne in 1985.When Ding Liren blundered in a seemingly equal and drawable position in the 14th and last game of the World Chess Championship in Singapore, Gukesh, the challenger, realised he would be the new monarch of the 64-square game.The World No. 5 could not hide his excitement and emotions. He smiled, covered his face and uncorked a winning move. Three moves later, Ding resigned to hand over the crown he held after beating Russia's Ian Nepomniachtchi via tiebreaks in Astana, Kazakhstan, last year.""I knew I could play on this game for 5-6 hours, but I was mentally prepared for tomorrow's tiebreaks,"" said Gukesh.Indeed, Ding was not expected to crack in this position - rook and light-squared bishop each with Gukesh having an extra pawn (2 vs 1). But the stage and time-pressure got to him as he played the only move on the 55th turn - without much provocation - which would end in a loss. Hence, it was no surprise that Gukesh first thanked the almighty after his moment of triumph.Ding had told chess24 on the eve of the last game that he was prepared for a long haul. But despite having white pieces and getting a decent position out of the opening, he was lured to play for the draw following Gukesh's 18th move (pawn to b5) after fearing for the worse without much reason.Being the champion does not mean I am the best player in the world,"" said Gukesh. ""It's motivating that someone (Magnus Carlsen) is at a very, very high level. That will help me to continue working hard.""Carlsen has withdrawn from the World Championship cycle that had helped Ding enter the fray last year. The five-time world champion had cited lack of motivation in classical time control and skewed 'effort vs reward ratio' for it.Thursday's game was heading towards a draw, and the match towards rapid tiebreaks. Considering Ding's experience and higher rating in shorter time controls, he was seen as the favourite in that phase.Finally, that was thrown out of the window much to the relief of the players as Gukesh won with a scoreline of 7.5-6.5 points. Gukesh won in 58 moves of Reti Opening, Kings Indian Attack variation from black pieces.Despite the path-breaking achievement, Gukesh did not lose his bearings. When Ding left the playing arena, Gukesh wept tears of joy but did not forget to rearrange his pieces and that of his opponent. He also bowed in front of the chess board before leaving the stage. In a show of great appreciation for his rival, Gukesh stood up when Ding was set to leave after finishing his part of the press conference and shook his hand. Till Ding left the hall, Gukesh was clapping for the Chinese.So, where did Ding go wrong? The Chinese brought his rook on the f2 square without realising that the rook exchange at that point would put cold water on all the resilience he had shown in this entire match. The 32-year-old Chinese's bishop was trapped on the 'a8' square, limited to just one diagonal. Plus, Gukesh's bishop was not only in a position to attack the rival's bishop but even his king was adjacent to complete even the bishop exchange followed by the rook exchange. And then with only two pawns vs one pawn remaining on the board, the situation was completely winning for Gukesh with more than an hour remaining on his clock.Ding said after the loss, ""Gukesh's face told me that I had just made the blunder. I was totally shocked. It was already not easy to draw the game. Maybe I just needed to wait (show patience). No game tomorrow. This tournament was my best performance of the year."" It underlined his overall struggle and how he raised his game in Singapore with wins in the first and 12th game after losing the third and 11th game. ""Considering yesterday's lucky escape (a draw in the 13th game), it's a fair result. I have no regrets.""","D Gukesh beats China's Ding Liren 7.5-6.5 to become 18th World chess champ at 18, the 1st teen ever - breaking Kasparov's record (22 yrs) and 2nd Indian after Viswanathan Anand.

Since 1988, Australia have won 26 of their last 35 Test matches at the Gabba, with only two losses and seven draws.India, on the other hand, have played seven Test matches at the venue between 1947 and 2021, securing one win and one draw.

Brief Scores:

BENGALURU: Mumbai have been at their dominant best with their batters calling the shots in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy . The lone blemish in their campaign has been the loss to Kerala in the league phase. On Friday, Ajinkya Rahane (98, 56b, 11x4, 5x6) continued his imperious form to help Mumbai overpower Baroda by six wickets and book a place in the final.In the title clash, Mumbai will be up against Madhya Pradesh who cantered past Delhi by seven wickets.At the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, chasing a modest target of 159, Rahane looked in a hurry. The former India captain smashed Baroda pacer Lukman Meriwala for two fours and a six off the first three balls. The attack set the tone for Mumbai despite Prithvi Shaw's dismissal in the third over.The ease at which Rahane belted Baroda bowlers was a sight to behold. The player pulled, cut and lofted bowlers with ease. He raced to 41 after six overs with skipper Shreyas Iyer enjoying the show from the other end. But the latter too gradually began to punish Baroda bowlers, who were too short and Iyer hammered them over the midwicket fence.Iyer, who coasted to 46 with four fours and three sixes, fell to Atit Sheth in the 13th over. But the 88-run second-wicket stand had already done the damage. With less than six runs required from the last seven, Rahane could sight a ton and dealt in sixes. In the end, he fell just two short as he was dismissed by Abhimanyu Rajput. In the next over, Suryansh Shedge applied the finishing touches hitting the winning six as Mumbai were home with 16 balls to spare as the in-form Baroda outfit had an off day.""For me, it's always about timing the ball. It's always about the extension of my defence. Even though I'm playing at a strike rate of 190-200, it's still classical batting,"" Rahane said.Earlier, after a second-wicket association of 50 runs between Krunal Pandya and Shashwat Rawat, Baroda fell flat. They collapsed from 73/1 to 89/5, which included the big wickets of Krunal and Hardik Pandya . Despite Shivalik Sharma's (36, 24b, 2x4, 2x6), they ended up with a below-par 158/7.Madhya Pradesh skipper Rajat Patidar (66, 29b, 4x4, 6x6) led the way with Harpreet Singh Bhatia (46, 38b, 4x4, 2x6) to guide their team to victory in the second semifinal played under lights. MP, who were chasing 147 runs, were reduced to 46/3 after Ishant Sharma's (2/12) early strikes.However, the unbeaten partnership of 106 for the third wicket between Patidar and Bhatia tilted the game in MP's favour, who won with 26 balls to spare. As for Delhi, their batters failed to make their start count. Anuj Rawat top-scored with an unbeaten 33 while Priyansh Arya and Mayank Rawat chipped in with 29 and 24 runs respectively.Baroda 158/7 in 20 overs (Shashwat Rawat 33, Krunal Pandya 30, Shivalik Sharma 34 n.o; Suryansh Shedge 2-11) lost to Mumbai 164/4 in 17.2 overs (Ajinkya Rahane 98, Shreyas Iyer 46) by six wickets; Delhi 146/5 in 20 overs (Priyansh Arya 29, Anuj Rawat 33 n.o, Mayank Rawat 24; Venkatesh Iyer 2/12) lost to MP 152/3 in 15.4 overs (Harsh Gawali 30, Harpreet Singh Bhatia 46 n.o, Rajat Patidar 66 n.o; Ishant Sharma 2/12) by seven wickets",Mumbai beat Baroda by six wickets to reach Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy final.

Without a half-century in last 15 innings outside the subcontinent, the pressure will be on India no. 3 to deliver

BRISBANE: The pressure sits lightly on Shubman Gill 's young shoulders. In many ways he is the crown prince of Indian cricket, having already been earmarked for future leadership roles and big batting responsibilities. Returning to the Gabba , in a way, marks a full circle to the first half of his Test career.It was in Australia, back on the 2020-21 tour, that Gill made his debut along with Mohammed Siraj in Melbourne, scored 45, and then went on to announce his arrival on the big stage with the second-innings 91 here that propelled India's famous win.At both the Gabba and in the preceding Test, in Sydney, his efforts were overshadowed by Rishabh Pant , but that poise at the crease and serenity in his strokeplay marked him out for bigger red-ball duties.No wonder he admitted he was ""nostalgic"" upon returning to the Gabba, but this isn't Gill 's time for 'good-old-days' vibes. Having missed the first Test with a finger injury, there's work to be done and some standout knocks to be scored to prove his overseas credentials.With Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rohit Sharma taking over opening duties, Gill staked his claim to the regular No. 3 spot in July 2023 in the West Indies, but his game was a stark contrast to predecessor Cheteshwar Pujara 's stonewalling approach.Since that move, Gill has rediscovered form-particularly in the home Test series against England at the beginning of the year-and showed there isn't one way to be an effective No. 3. Now, he averages 41.04 in 27 innings at that position, an improvement on both his average as opener (32.37 in 29 innings) and overall average (36.45).Still, it's his overseas record that needs improvement, irrespective of his batting position. Since that 91 at the Gabba, Gill has just one overseas ton-the 110 against Bangladesh in Chattogram in 2022-and is now without a fifty in 15 innings in overseas Tests played in Australia, England, West Indies and South Africa.It's in Australia, though, that he still has his best average in any country (45.42 from 4 Tests), and Gill explained on Friday why he thought it was special to play here.""The intensity at which the games are played here, especially Test matches, is one of the most difficult things. To be able to maintain that intensity over the course of five days is what makes touring Australia so difficult. More than anything it's the mental fitness and the mental intensity that is required in Australia,"" he said.Gill looked fluent as long as he lasted in Adelaide but said he was flustered by wickets constantly falling at the other end. ""Because of what happened at the other end, I kind of took that on me. One of the challenges is how you can play your game irrespective of what is happening at the other end. There was a period where I faced, maybe, one ball in four overs and then the next ball I missed a straight ball, a fuller ball. These are the challenges,"" he said.Gill also became the latest in a long line of Indian players to complain about difficulties sighting the pink ball in Adelaide, and like his teammates is relieved the regular Kookaburra red will be back for the third Test. ""As a batting group, we are looking to post a big total first up. That's been the discussion and every batter has his own game plan,"" Gill said.Posting big first-innings totals has been a problem for India for a while now. Their last five first-innings score reads 46 all out in 31.2 overs in Bengaluru, 156 in 45.3 overs in Pune, 263 in 59.4 overs in Mumbai (all against NZ), 150 in 49.4 overs in Perth and 180 in 44.1 overs in Adelaide (on this tour). It's a weakness the team is eager to rectify, and runs from Gill will help. ""It looks like a good wicket, to be honest,"" he said. ""We'll know once we play on it.""",India's Shubman Gill returns to the Gabba for the third Test against Australia. Gill made his Test debut in Melbourne on the 2020-21 tour.

Unlike 2021, when visitors scored a famous win, the pitch is likely to be livelier

BRISBANE: 'The Gabbatoir'. Making mincemeat of visiting teams since 1931. The stronghold which makes enemy troops shake. Also the place where India have a powerful performance or two.For decades shaky in Australian conditions, the team first mustered the stomach for a fight here in 2003. Sourav Ganguly 's masterful 144 staved off the 'chin music' and wrested a hard-fought draw.For years, the Gabba set the tone for Australia in a home series. A few years ago, commercial considerations pushed it down the pecking order. With that one change, the venue seemed in danger of losing its fresh-season, early mover advantage. It fell on a new-age Indian team to move in for the kill, to break the illusion of Aussie invincibility. In Jan 2021, Rishabh Pant 's superpowers handed the hosts their first defeat here since 1989, when the mighty West Indies pacers still held sway.That loss wasn't an aberration. Earlier this year, Shamar Joseph ran through the Aussies with a second-innings 7/68 as West Indies won here again - by eight runs. Now, heading into the third Test of this see-saw series, Pat Cummins ' men find themselves with the rather mediocre record of having lost two of their last four Tests here.As always with the Gabba, there's a catch. Both Tests Australia lost were staged in late season January. The ground may not be hosting the first Test of this five-game marathon, but it is still mid-Dec, pre-Christmas. The ancient demons of the Gabba may fancy unleashing their horrors again.At least, that's the expectation. The demons may not even awaken if they find that fast bowlers on either side don't need much help in toppling two fragile batting units.As for the batters, there's hope yet. See off the first session or two and the runs may flow. The series is tied 1-1. It begins anew. ""For us this is a three-Test series now,"" declared Shubman Gill on match eve. Australia, on the other hand, are in muscle-flexing mode after demolishing India in Adelaide. Cummins cleverly upped the ante by promising more of that 'chin music' which worked wonders in the pink-ball Test.""It (the short-ball tactic) worked well in the Adelaide Test. It's always at the back of your mind as a Plan B, or if it's looking really uncomfortable (for the batters) and is likely to take wickets. Maybe it becomes a Plan A to some of the batters. I'm sure we'll give it a shot at some point in the Test,"" Cummins said. Gill rallied back, saying, ""What successful plan? The plan only worked on a couple of tailenders."" The mind games too have begun anew.The focus shifts firmly to the batters, including some ageing stalwarts on either side. India have some hard thinking to do regarding their batting order and combination. Their out-of-form captain Rohit Sharma has been slowly working his way back into some sort of rhythm and spending long hours in the nets. Will he be confident enough to reclaim his opening slot and push KL Rahul down the order?There will also be expectation that Virat Kohli , who scored a century in Perth when both the pressure and conditions had eased, can come up with a game-changing knock. Runs from the top four in both innings are crucial at the Gabba, and have tilted the scales for the winning side nine times in the last 10 Tests here.Then there's the question of Washington Sundar. He made his debut in that Brisbane win, played a big role and has even named his pet dog 'Gabba'. Should Sundar ease Ashwin out of the XI?The young guns who impressed in 2021 following a spate of injuries and withdrawals - Pant, Gill and Sundar - will be under pressure this time. Reprising the magic could take some doing. For Jaiswal too, it will be new territory. No wonder all of them were knocking away in the nets even on match eve, which is usually an optional session. That in-between back-of-a-length delivery has bothered all of India's batters, and all of them have been working hard to iron out the chinks. Maybe Cummins was bluffing with the whole 'short ball' jibe.As for the bowlers, whether the team management continues to back Harshit Rana, who had a very ordinary game in Adelaide, or whether Akash Deep takes his place, the Bumrah-led attack has its task cut out. They must attack the stumps more than they did in Adelaide and not dish out halfvolleys in trying to bowl fuller.Australia, meanwhile, have laid their cards on the table. Scott Boland, hero of Adelaide, makes way for the fit-again Josh Hazlewood, much to the chagrin of his considerable fan base. Like Rohit and Kohli, Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne, who found some form in Adelaide, are under extreme pressure.It's the depth and quality of the Aussie pace attack which gives the hosts an advantage heading into this Test. Recent early season games here have been fast and furious affairs. A Test against South Africa in Dec 2022 ended in two days. There's also scattered thunderstorms predicted on most days. Conditions could be tricky.Can the storied Gabba, on its last legs as a Test-match venue before it is face-lifted as a multi-sports arena ahead of the 2032 Brisbane Olympics, add to its cricketing lore?",India take on Australia in third Test at The Gabba in Brisbane. The hosts have lost two of their last four Tests here. The series is tied 1-1 after the second Test in Adelaide. The pitch is likely to be livelier than in the first Test.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116305256,imgsize-79132,width-400,resizemode-4/116305256.jpg"

(Photo by Robert Cianflone/Getty Images)

Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has expressed his belief that Australia will win the third Test match against India in Brisbane . This despite Australia's recent losses at the Gabba to India and the West Indies.The first two matches of the ICC World Test Championship have been split between the two teams. India won the first match in Perth by a significant margin of 295 runs. Australia then responded with a convincing 10-wicket victory in the day-night Test in Adelaide.Ponting anticipates a closer contest in the third Test. However, he still predicts an Australian victory. He shared his views in a conversation with Sanjana Ganesan on The ICC Review.""It is really hard to say what to expect after the way the first two games have gone. I mean, they have been complete blowouts either way, so you do not really know what to expect. I have got a feeling it will be a bit more of an even contest than the first couple of games. I still think Australia will win,"" he added.Ponting bases his prediction on Australia's strong historical record at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, commonly known as the Gabba. Australia enjoyed a 31-match unbeaten streak at the venue between 1989 and 2020.In recent years, Australia have suffered two defeats at the Gabba, against India and the West Indies. Despite these setbacks, Ponting maintains his confidence in Australia's ability to win.""Generally, the team that wins the toss in Brisbane will bat first, aim to post a big score over the first couple of days, and then wait for the pitch to offer more assistance to the bowlers later in the game. That is typically how teams play there,"" Ponting explained.""Australia, if (Josh) Hazlewood is not fit, will likely remain unchanged. India have some decisions to make. Who do I think will dominate? It will probably be a bowler-friendly pitch for the first couple of days. There is usually 8-10mm of grass on the wicket at the Gabba. If it is cloudy and overcast, the bowlers will be licking their lips, and batsmen will need to work hard for their runs.""He added, ""I will back recent form. India have a good record, but historically, Australia have lost just twice at the Gabba in about 40 years. So, I will back Australia to win.""Ponting reiterated his earlier prediction of a 3-1 series win for Australia, which he had made on a previous episode of The ICC Review. He admitted being surprised by India's victory in Perth. He had initially expected Australia to win both the Perth and Adelaide Tests.""Yeah, I will stick to it, but I was not expecting India to have a win next to their name at this stage. I thought Australia would win in Perth and Adelaide,"" Ponting said.""From here ... Brisbane is next. India played beautifully there last time, but I think they will find it hard to win again, especially after what happened in Adelaide,"" he added.Ponting acknowledges India's history of performing well under pressure. He stated that India often plays its best cricket when facing adversity.""This Indian team has shown in the past that when their backs are against the wall, they often play their best cricket,"" he said.""However, I still think Australia are a slightly better and more well-rounded team. If they can maintain their form from Adelaide, they will be tough to beat in Brisbane,"" he concluded.",Ricky Ponting believes Australia will win the third Test against India in Brisbane. The first two matches of the ICC World Test Championship have been split between the two teams. Australia enjoyed a 31-match unbeaten streak at the venue between 1989 and 2020.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116297744,imgsize-89178,width-400,resizemode-4/116297744.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Rajat Patidar struck a dazzling 29-ball 66 not out as Madhya Pradesh secured a spot in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20 final after 13 years, defeating former champions Delhi by seven wickets in the semifinal at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Friday.Patidar’s explosive unbeaten half-century, coupled with an exceptional bowling performance spearheaded by all-rounder Venkatesh Iyer, propelled Madhya Pradesh into the title clash against Mumbai.Choosing to bowl first, Madhya Pradesh’s bowlers vindicated their skipper’s decision with a clinical effort that stifled Delhi’s batting lineup.Despite a steady opening partnership between Yash Dhull (11) and Priyansh Arya (29), who added 38 runs in 33 balls, Delhi struggled to maintain momentum. Tripuresh Singh broke the stand by dismissing Dhull, and Kumar Kartikeya soon sent Arya back, leaving Delhi at 54 for 2 in the ninth over.The match turned in Madhya Pradesh’s favor when Venkatesh Iyer struck twice in the 11th over, removing skipper Ayush Badoni (19) and Himmat Singh (15). Iyer’s crucial spell of 2 for 12 dented Delhi’s innings, reducing them to 79 for 5.Late contributions from Anuj Rawat (33 not out off 24) and Mayank Rawat (24 off 21) took Delhi to a fighting 146 for 5.Madhya Pradesh’s chase began on a shaky note as veteran pacer Ishant Sharma dismissed opener Arpit Gaud for a first-ball duck. Ishant struck again to send Subhranshu Senapati (7) back, leaving Madhya Pradesh reeling at 20/2 in the third over.However, Harsh Gawli counter-attacked with an aggressive 30 off 18 balls, including four boundaries and a six, to steady the chase. Though Gawli fell to Himanshu Chauhan in the seventh over.From there, Rajat Patidar took control. Showcasing his remarkable batting prowess, Patidar unleashed a masterclass of power-hitting, smashing six sixes and four fours. Harpreet Singh Bhatia provided steady support with an unbeaten 46 off 34 balls. Together, the duo forged a match-winning 106-run partnership off just 57 balls, extinguishing any hopes of a Delhi comeback.Madhya Pradesh will now face Mumbai in the finale on Sunday at the same venue, with both teams vying for the prestigious title.Brief scores:Delhi 146 for 6 in 20 overs (Anuj Rawat 33, Priyansh Arya 29; Venkatesh Iyer 2-12, Tripuresh Singh 1-18) lose to Madhya Pradesh 152 for 3 in 15.4 overs (Rajat Patidar 66 not out, Harpreet Singh 46 not out; Ishant Sharma 2-12, Himanshu Chauhan 1-37) by seven wickets.",Madhya Pradesh beat Delhi by seven wickets to reach Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy final.

Stockholm: Swedish prosecutors on Thursday dropped a rape investigation that was launched in connection with football star Kylian Mbappé's visit to Stockholm in October.In a statement, lead investigator Marina Chirakova said there was not enough evidence to continue the investigation, which centered on an incident at a hotel.“During the course of the investigation, there has been a designated person suspected on reasonable grounds of rape and two cases of sexual assault, but my assessment is that the evidence is not sufficient to proceed and the investigation is therefore closed,"" Chirakova said. “The designated person has not been notified of suspicion of a crime.”Prosecutors never publicly named the suspect in the investigation, but many Swedish media reported it was Real Madrid striker Mbappe , who visited Stockholm in October during a break in the Spanish league.At the time Mbappe's legal team dismissed those reports as false.Mbappe's lawyer Marie-Alix Canu-Bernard and the player's representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comments on Thursday.In an interview that aired Sunday on French TV station, Mbappe said he was ""surprised"" by the reports that he was the subject of a rape investigation and he had not been contacted by Swedish authorities.“These are things that come into your life like that, you can’t see them coming,” Mbappe told. ""It's just incomprehension. I don’t think it weighed on me in the sense that I have never considered myself involved.”The 25-year-old football star appeared in Stockholm on October 10 during an international break instead of playing for France in the Nations League.

Before the season began, advancing to the next stage of the new format seemed inevitable for a side that had won the last four Premier League titles and was the 2023 European champion. However, that is no longer the case as City manager Pep Guardiola struggles with injuries and his players' seeming lack of faith.With goals from Dušan Vlahovic and Weston McKennie causing the most recent loss and igniting Juventus' hopes of qualifying, City has only won one of its last ten games across all competitions.Barcelona 's 3-2 victory over Borussia Dortmund propelled them into second position in the league rankings, behind Liverpool, and ensured their advancement. Ferran Torres and Raphinha each scored two goals for Barcelona.Bukayo Saka 's two goals helped Arsenal defeat Monaco 3-0, putting them in third position and ahead of six other clubs with 13 points.The clubs ranked No. 9-24 enter a two-leg playoff, while the top eight advance straight to the round of 16.The first of City's two remaining Champions League games comes against Paris Saint-Germain, another struggling powerhouse in 25th place, one point outside of the qualifying spots.With a powerful header aimed directly at City goalkeeper Ederson, who was only able to divert the ball over his own line, Vlahovic gave Juventus the lead in the 53rd minute. Juve won thanks to two American substitutes, including McKennie, who volleyed home from a cross from Timothy Weah.Juventus rose to 14th position.Last season's runner-up Dortmund was forced out of the top eight after Ferran Torres came off the bench to lead Barcelona to their fifth victory in six games.Robert Lewandowski, who had a quiet game against his old team, was replaced by Torres in the 71st minute. Torres scored on the rebound of Dani Olmo's shot just four minutes later.The score was tied at 2-2 after Serhou Guirassy's second goal of the match, but Torres scored again in the 85th minute after Lamine Yamal's counterattack.Barcelona took the lead thanks to Raphinha, and Guirassy equalized from the penalty spot. Lewandowski leads the league with seven goals, while Raphinha and Guirassy are tied for second place with six goals each.Saka scored goals in the 34th and 78th minutes and put in a shot that was converted into the net by substitute Kai Havertz in the 88th, giving Arsenal their third consecutive league-stage home victory without giving up.On goal differential, Arsenal leads Bayer Leverkusen, Aston Villa, Inter Milan, Brest, and Lille. On Wednesday, Lille defeated Sturm Graz 3-2 at home.AC Milan defeated Red Star Belgrade 2-1, with Tammy Abraham scoring the game-winning goal in the 87th minute to pull one point out of the top eight. In the first half, Milan lost Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Alvaro Morata to muscular ailments.Feyenoord defeated Sparta Prague 4-2, while Benfica drew 0-0 at home against Bologna to stop their five-game winning streak.","Manchester City fell to 22nd in the 36-team Champions League standings.
