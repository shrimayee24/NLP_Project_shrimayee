NEW DELHI: Avani Lekhara , a 22-year-old Indian athlete, made history on Friday by becoming the first Indian woman to secure two Paralympic gold medals . She achieved this remarkable feat by winning the women's 10m air rifle (SH1) event, surpassing her own record of 249.6 set in the Tokyo Paralympics .Avani's compatriot, Mona Agarwal , also made a strong showing, claiming the bronze medal with a score of 228.7.Avani's journey to the top has been nothing short of inspiring. At the age of 11, she was left paralyzed below the waist following a car accident. Despite the challenges she faced, Avani persevered and became the first woman shooter from India to win medals in shooting at the Tokyo Paralympics in 2021.The SH1 category in shooting is designed for athletes who have movement affected in their arms, lower trunk, legs, or have no limbs.In the qualification round, Avani demonstrated her exceptional skills by shooting a score of 625.8, securing the second position behind Iryna Shchetnik, who set a new Paralympic qualification record with a score of 627.5.Mona, a two-time World Cup gold medallist making her Paralympic debut, also performed admirably, shooting 623.1 and entering the final in fifth place.Hailing from Jaipur, Rajasthan, Avani's journey exemplifies resilience, determination, and an unwavering pursuit of excellence. Following a life-changing road accident in 2012 that left her wheelchair-bound, Avani's father encouraged her to explore sports as a form of physical and mental rehabilitation.Despite the challenges, Avani's indomitable spirit led her to take up archery before transitioning to competitive shooting in 2015, inspired by the achievements of Abhinav Bindra Avani's dedication and natural talent quickly propelled her to success, as she accumulated victories at both national and international levels. She set World Records at junior and senior levels, establishing herself as a rising star in para shooting.Alongside her sporting pursuits, Avani is committed to her academic goals and was enrolled in a five-year law degree program at the University of Rajasthan, highlighting her multifaceted talents and determination to excel in all aspects of life.The pinnacle of Avani's sporting career came in 2021 when she made history at the Paralympic Games, becoming the first Indian female Paralympian to win two medals-a gold and a bronze-in a single event.Her triumphs resonated across the nation, and her remarkable achievements have been recognized with prestigious awards such as the Padma Shri and Khel Ratna. These honours celebrate her sporting success and stand as a testament to her perseverance, courage, and ability to overcome adversity.","Avani Lekhara, 22, became the first Indian woman to win two Paralympic gold medals.

Avani shot a superb 249.7, breaking her own Paralympic record of 249.6 set in Tokyo three years ago.Avani, 22, clinched gold after trailing her rival, South Korea's Lee Yunri, by a few decimal points.Lee faltered with a final shot of 6.8, while Avani maintained her composure, scoring 10.5. This remarkable achievement followed a difficult preparation period for Avani, who had undergone gallbladder surgery and took a one-and-a-half-month recovery break.Avani's perseverance was evident during the national camp at the Karni Singh Ranges, where she worked to regain her strength and mental focus. Despite losing weight due to surgery, her determination remained unshaken. She credited the ""positive environment"" in the national camp for helping her overcome her fitness worries.""I am happy to win a medal for my country. I am thankful to my team, my coaches and my parents,"" said Avani after the match.In a nerve-wracking final, Avani's mental fortitude stood out. The lead alternated between Avani, Mona, and Lee, but Avani's consistent performance under pressure secured her victory. The SH1 category includes athletes with movement limitations in their arms, lower trunk, legs, or those without limbs. Avani, who uses a wheelchair after a car accident at age 11 left her paralyzed below the waist, continues to inspire with her achievements.This is the first time two Indian shooters have medaled in a single Paralympic event. Mona Agarwal, 37, took bronze with a score of 228.7. Mona had previously tried various sports, including shot-put, powerlifting, and wheelchair volleyball, before focusing on shooting .Earlier in the competition, Avani qualified for the final in second place, shooting 625.8, while Mona secured fifth spot with a score of 623.1. Ukraine's Iryna Shchetnik broke the Paralympic Qualification Record with 627.5.Avani's gold is expected to boost her confidence ahead of the 50m rifle 3-positions event, where she also aims for a medal. She won bronze in this event at the Tokyo Paralympics.Reflecting on her journey, Avani's relentless dedication to her sport is evident. Despite health setbacks, she remained focused on her goal. As an assistant conservator of forests with the Rajasthan government, Avani balanced her professional commitments with rigorous training.Mona's achievement is equally noteworthy. Her journey in sports has been varied, and her decision to settle on shooting has now paid off with an Olympic bronze. Her performance in the past year has been commendable, with two World Cup gold medals to her name.""I think we have been in a very positive environment throughout. We are just focussing on the process rather than the outcome.""There, obviously, will be expectations but those expectations only motivate me and inspire me more to give my best. I am also more mature in my technique,"" she had said before leaving for Paris.This historic performance by Avani and Mona is a proud moment for India. As they stood on the podium, their achievements highlighted not only their skill but also their unwavering determination and mental toughness.","Avani Lekhara, 22, becomes first Indian to win successive Paralympic gold medals.

NEW DELHI: Over 100 members of the Indian contingent, including 52 athletes across various sports, will participate in the Paris Paralympics opening ceremony. This event is significant as it marks the first time the ceremony is being held outside a stadium in the history of the Games.However, athletes with events scheduled for the following day, such as all 10 members of the shooting team, will not participate in the parade of nations.""All athletes competing on August 29 will not join the opening ceremony as it would be challenging for them to perform the next day. The shooting team will skip the parade of nations,"" said Devendra Jhajharia, president of the Paralympics Committee of India.The shooting team, which includes Tokyo gold medallist Avani Lekhara, is currently based in Chateauroux, over 200km from Paris, where the shooting events are set to take place.Sumit Antil (F64) and Bhagyashree Jadhav (F34) will serve as the joint flag bearers for India at the opening ceremony. This event will take place outdoors at the Champs-Elysees and Place de la Concorde in central Paris. Delegations from all countries will march down a section of the Champs-Elysees, one of Paris's most iconic avenues.Sumit Antil is the defending gold medallist in javelin, while Bhagyashree Jadhav competes in shot put.This follows the example of the Paris Olympics opening ceremony, which was also held outside a traditional stadium on July 26, along the Seine River.India has sent a record 84-member team to the Paris Paralympics, aiming to win 25 medals, including at least ten golds. At the 2021 Tokyo Paralympics, India's 54-member team won 19 medals, including five golds.","The full day-by-day schedule for Indian athletes at the Paris 2024 Paralympics is as follows. Indian athletes will compete in swimming, cycling, Table Tennis, Archery, Taekwondo and Shooting. The Games will take place between August 28 and 30, 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112853730,imgsize-114094,width-400,resizemode-4/112853730.jpg"
Avani makes history with back-to-back Paralympics gold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-paralympics/avani-makes-history-with-back-to-back-paralympics-gold/articleshow/112932756.cms,"JAIPUR/NEW DELHI: India's shooting sisterhood continued to do wonders at Chateauroux, 300-km south of Paris, when Avani Lekhara and Mona Agarwal earned a gold and a bronze medal finish in the 10m air rifle standing SH1 event at the Paralympics 2024. The girls from Rajasthan ensured that for the first time in Paralympics history, two Indians would finish on the podium in the same event.A month earlier, Manu Bhaker had led the country’s shooting medals spree with two medals, with men shooters, Sarabjot Singh and Swapnil Kusale chipping in with a bronze each.This was young Avani's second gold at the Paralympics, the Jaipur girl successfully defending her 2020 mantle with a score of 249.7, marginally bettering her 249.6 Tokyo record. Mona, hailing from Sikar in north-east Rajasthan, and making her debut at the para games, recorded 228.7. She would later thank the 23-year-old Avani for the unique support and sense of one-ness that shooting in packs brings. ""It was very difficult, but I succeeded,"" the 37-year-old Mona said, ""So, thank you, Avani. Being in your company helped.""In a nerve-racking close final, Avani trailed her rival Lee Yunri, till the South Korean, done in by the pressure, turned in a poor last shot of 6.8. Avani kept her cool, firing a superb 10.5 for gold. ""It was very close, such a little gap between 1, 2 and 3. I was focusing on my thought process and not the result,"" Avani would tell a world watching in disbelief later.It was never going to be easy, but the girls were determined to make light of it. For those who came in late, the SH1 category at the Paralympics is for athletes who have movement affected in their arms, lower trunk, legs or have no limbs. Both Avani and Mona are wheelchair bound and the story could have been so different.Only a few months back, the Tokyo gold winner was simply in no shape to defend her title at Paris. A gallbladder surgery was the latest in a line of medical setbacks. In 2011, a near-fatal car mishap had left her paralysed from waist-down below, her morale shattered and the future bleak. ""Emotionally and financially, it was a tough time for the family,"" remembers father Praveen Lekhara, ""The operation cost us Rs 4-5 lakh. Our situation was not good.""""Post Tokyo, the Central government's help has reduced our burden. A lot of things around Avani's shooting are being taken care of by the government,"" he added.Avani came back against all odds to win gold at Tokyo. ""Fame gave her new motivation, a new inspiration and made her more confident, both personally and professionally,"" personal coach, Suma Shirur, a former multiple Asian and Commonwealth Games medal winner, had said then.Still, despite the addiction that success can bring, fate can have other plans. Months before Paris, well within her training arc, the rifle shooter underwent gallbladder surgery. It took Avani nearly two months to return to training, but in the process, she lost a lot of weight during her recovery.But what she didn't lose was hope.Back at the shooting arena, Avani doubled her efforts. ""Following her operation, she put in extra effort to cover the lost time. I was a bit worried, but her body supported her, and her champion's mindset helped her prevail in the final,"" Shirur said.On a rainy Friday afternoon at the Chateauroux shooting range, it would all come to fruit.Herself engaged in the see-saw battle in the final and watching her younger partner's nerves of steel, Mona felt most of it rub off on her. A ‘disappointment' for her family when she was born, since they wanted a male child after two daughters, further misfortune came in the form of a wet floor in 2014 for the poli-stricken girl, Avani's shooting her own comeuppance alongside at Chateauroux would have been nothing short of cathartic. Father Premchand, who runs a hardware shop in Nepal, is today a proud man. ""Everyone in their family is quite positive now,"" her coach Yogesh Shekhawat said.Slipping on the wet floor resulted in her paralysis from the waist down. She turned to para-shooting as a way to rebuild her life. The wheelchair-bound Mona took a crack at shotput, discus throw, powerlifting and javelin, before finally settling for shooting in 2022. ""She travelled looking for para women interested in volleyball and created a national team but realised that of all the games shooting will suit her body most,"" remembered Shekhawat.Married to a national para basketball player in Jaipur, Agarwal, a mother of two, has made her children proud.""The feeling is great. I am happy to win back-to-back gold medals for my country. The final was tough because I was up against a champion shooter,"" the assistant conservator of forest with the Rajasthan government, would smile afterwards.Today, a ""proud"" Praveen revels in doing the right thing by taking Avani to a shooting range, confident that the move will help his daughter lead a full life again. ""Winning gold twice at the Paralympics is a big moment in her life. Her performance also shows how committed she has been to the sport, and Avani can inspire all women, more so the specially-abled to believe,"" he said.","Avani Lekhara and Mona Agarwal earn a gold and a bronze medal finish in the 10m air rifle standing SH1 event at the Paralympics 2024. The girls from Rajasthan ensured that for the first time in Paralympic history, two Indians would finish on the podium in the same event.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112932763,imgsize-27504,width-400,resizemode-4/112932763.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Pakistan left out star pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi for the second Test match against Bangladesh starting in Rawalpindi on Friday, with Pakistan's head coach Jason Gillespie saying he will be rested to allow him to spend time with his new-born son and family.Bangladesh upset a formidable home team with a clinical ten-wicket display in the first Test -- their first win in over 14 encounters against Pakistan, as Afridi struggled to find his rhythm through much of the innings.Now former Pakistan batsman Ahmad Shahzad has questioned the decision to drop Afridi from the team.Taking to his official X handle, Ahmad Shahzad said in a video, ""You first lost to Zimbabwe, then lost to Ireland, lost to USA, lost to India, now you have lost to Bangladesh as well. Is Shaheen Afridi only responsible for all these defeats? No, he is not solely responsible. All should be questioned who were involved in these defeats. Tell this country. Holding Shaheen Afridi alone responsible for all the defeats is wrong. Look at his performances, there's a problem in his attitude, you dropped him, that's fine. But what about others? What about their performances? What is the performance of Abdullah Shafique in the last 8 matches? You have brought in Saim Ayub back after 25 matches, what's his performance? What's the performance of Babar Azam in the last 14 innings in Tests?""""So by dropping only Afridi will not Pakistan on the right track, you will have to take some harsh decisions.

He made his debut for the Indian national team in 2016 and quickly established himself as a key player across all formats.Bumrah's unique bowling action and exceptional ability to generate pace and bounce have made him one of the most feared bowlers in world cricket.He is particularly known for his death bowling, where he excels at containing runs and taking crucial wickets.A video is viral on the internet where during an event Bumrah is asked if there is any batsman who he thinks has been tough to bowl to.As the crowd cheered on, Bumrah gave a very smart answer, without naming any batsman.Bumrah says, ""Look I want to give a good answer but the real factor is that I don't want anyone to take over me in my head because obviously I respect everyone, but in my head I tell myself that if I do my job well, there's nobody in the world who can stop me. So I look at myself rather than the opponent so if I think that I have control over everything and if I give myself the best opportunity, everything else will take care of itself rather than giving the power to the batsman that he'll get the better of me and he's better than me, so that I don't want to.""To say that Bumrah played a pivotal role in India's T20 World Cup triumph in June this year would be an understatement.Bumrah took 15 wickets at an average of 8.26, finishing with an astonishing economy of just 4.17 that was the best rate of those to bowl a minimum of 20 overs at the tournament and was named the Player of the Tournament in a campaign that saw India winning their first ICC trophy after 2013.Even though Bumrah has dealt with some injury issues over the years, which have occasionally kept him out of action, he remains a crucial part of the Indian cricket team's plans, especially in major tournaments like the World Cup.Bumrah is also the first bowler in the history of the game to be ranked Number One in the ICC Rankings in all the three formats.","Jasprit Bumrah is one of the premier fast bowlers in international cricket.

""I have no regrets. Having regret just makes life difficult,"" Faiz says.Faiz's superlative performances in Ireland paved the way for his LLC stint. The opener guided his Lisburn to two maiden T20 titles - Northern Cricket Union T20 league and also the Ireland National T20 Cup.Faiz scored 88 in Lisburn's chase of 192-run target set by Leinster as the final match ended in a tie. In the ensuing Super Over, Faiz hit 22 runs in four balls, slamming a boundary and three consecutive sixes, as Lisburn scored 23 runs. Leinster managed just 9 for 2 in the Super Over paving the way for Lisburn's maiden title triumph in the All-Ireland T20.""I'm really happy with my performance so far this year. I'm indebted to the almighty that I was able to contribute to the success of my team. This was the first time that Lisburn emerged as the winner in the Northern Cricket Union T20 league and also the Ireland National T20 Cup,"" Faiz said.One of the sixes hit by Faiz in the Super Over was an uncharacteristic scoop shot behind the wicket. One can't remember Faiz ever playing such a shot for Vidarbha. ""Well, a few years before retiring I mostly used to play the longer format. Playing such a shot in a four-day game was never a prudent idea. But I have been playing unorthodox shots whenever I represented teams other than Vidarbha, where I didn't have to shoulder the responsibility of holding the innings together. In Ireland I have been able to play freely in T20s,"" said Faiz.Playing with Lisburn, a team that values him as a player, Faiz says that he is in a good frame of mind. Used to changing his game as per the team's needs, Faiz is doing just that in Ireland too.""After a tumultuous year or so I'm finally at peace. Conditions here in Ireland are a bit challenging for batting. The chilling temperatures and windy conditions make batting a tough job. But as a professional the team looks up to me to deliver and I have been able to stand up to their expectations,"" Faiz said.Apart from playing, Faiz has been donning the hat of batting consultant to Northern Knights, an Ireland based team. ""On the request of Cricket Ireland, I did a couple of sessions with the national team ahead of their maiden Test match against Zimbabwe,"" he said.",Faiz Fazal was picked by India Capitals for Rs 25 lakh in the Legends League Cricket ( LLC ) auction on Thursday. The prolific batter retired from domestic cricket a few months ago. Faiz guided his Lisburn to two maiden T20 titles - Northern Cricket Union T20 league and also the Ireland National T20 Cup.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112934396,imgsize-25000,width-400,resizemode-4/112934396.jpg"

So, there will be pressure as the home side but the players are experienced enough to live up to the challenge,"" Molina remarked.NEUFC too have their own ambitions, standing on the cusp of history. This is not going to be a normal game for them as they eye their maiden trophy since having come into being in Indian football as one of the ISL franchises 10 years ago.A year ago at the same venue, they lost to East Bengal FC via a penalty shootout in the Durand Cup semifinal. They are ready to learn lessons from that defeat and make amends now.""They (Mohun Bagan) are favourites, but we have not come here for holidaying. What will we do tomorrow? It's easy on the board and it's what we'll do the pitch will determine the result. And what better way than facing Mohun Bagan to know where we stand now,"" NEUFC's present manager Juan Pedro Benali said during his pre-match press conference on Friday.In the likes of Dimitri Petratos, Jason Cummings and Greg Stewart, Bagan have the quality and firepower to singe any opponent. However, of the handful of truths that generally govern football as a sport, attack wins you a match but defence holds the key to winning a tournament.The way Bagan conceded 4 goals in the two knockout matches may not have escaped Benali's notebook. NEUFC are defensively strong, conceding just 1 goal in 5 matches so far. Their tactical shifts, ability to play in phases and holding the fort in numbers when needed may present a stern test to Bagan's ambitions.Aware of having to play a catch-up game in the knockouts, both Molina and Stewart want the final to be decided in regulation time. ‘It's a great opportunity to win our first trophy of the season. We're excited to get it done,"" Stewart said.In their maiden meeting outside ISL, Bagan will have the crowd to back them in this mission. NEUFC, on the other hand, are expected to have a special supporter in the stands - their co-owner and Bollywood actor John Abraham. ""We hope to give him a smile after the match,"" Benali said, grinning.",Mohun Bagan SG host NorthEast United FC in Saturday's Durand Cup final. Bagan are the defending champions and most successful team of Asia's oldest football club tournament. NEUFC are standing on the cusp of history as they eye their maiden trophy since coming into being in Indian football as one of the ISL franchises 10 years ago.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112934022,imgsize-158014,width-400,resizemode-4/112934022.jpg"

It's important for women's football in India,"" Crispin Chhetri said of Odisha FC Women 's AFC Women's Champions League preliminary stage match against Jordan's Etihad Club on Saturday.A win for Crispin's wards in the Jordanian city of Zarqa would ensure that they finish the stage as Group B leaders and earn a coveted berth in the group stage of the inaugural AFC women's competition.However, it will not be an easy game for the Indians against the home side who are currently leading Group B after thrashing Singapore's Lion City Sailors 5-0 in their first game of the preliminary stage. The scoreline made sure that they have a better goal difference than Odisha FC, who had routed the Singaporean club 4-1 in their opener.Apart from the fact that Etihad will enjoy home advantage in the crucial tie, they will also have the experience of playing on artificial turf, unlike their Indian counterparts.""The only advantage that they have is that they are used to playing on artificial turf. For us, it's a bit tricky and we will take time to adjust,"" head coach Crispin told TOI from Jordan on Friday.""Etihad (Club) are more experienced than the Sailors and they are in the middle of the Jordan's league so the understanding amongst themselves is better, and they are match fit,"" added the coach.The trickiness of an artificial pitch had already claimed its victim in the first game when Pyari Xaxa had to be substituted midway through the second half with a knee injury. While the coach said they will take a call on her participation on Saturday morning, he will also have to make adjustments in his starting lineup with Grace Dangmei and Neha, too, injured.The team will once again back on the scoring prowess of Lynda Kom Serto, who scored two of Odisha's four goals in the opener, and hope that the training sessions they have had between the games will bolster their game on the Jordanian pitch.As Crispin put it during the interaction, ""We have prepared well. Now it's time for execution.""",Odisha FC Women face Jordan's Etihad Club in AFC Women's Champions League preliminary stage match on Saturday.

Ronaldo’s accomplishments in the competition over more than 18 years were highlighted.Ronaldo has scored 140 Champions League goals in 183 appearances.He is the all-time leading goalscorer in the UEFA Champions League, 11 goals ahead of Lionel Messi and 46 ahead of Robert Lewandowski, who is in third place. Ronaldo's scoring prowess has set him apart in the competition.He has finished as the leading scorer in seven different Champions League seasons, more than any other player. His scoring feats range from eight goals in Manchester United ’s 2007/08 triumphant campaign to 15 goals when Real Madrid claimed their third consecutive title in the 2017/18 season.

This includes his goal in the extra-time win against Atlético de Madrid in the final.""For me, it’s a pleasure to be here. Thank you for this amazing award. As you know, Champions League is the highest in football. The records speak for themselves but the league (is at that level) because of the players that play in the competition.

However, his tenure was marked by inconsistency, culminating in a disappointing seventh-place finish in the previous season.Despite a promising draw in the opening match of the current season, Sampdoria suffered consecutive defeats in their subsequent fixtures.This left them languishing in 18th position, a stark contrast to the club's ambition of immediate promotion. This ultimately led to the club's decision to relieve Pirlo of his duties.This marks the third managerial stint for the 45-year-old, whose coaching career has yet to mirror the success he enjoyed as a player.His first foray into management came with Juventus in 2020, but his time in Turin proved short-lived after a single season that fell short of expectations.A subsequent move to Turkish club Fatih Karagümrük yielded a seventh-place finish in the Süper Lig, a respectable outcome that nonetheless failed to solidify his coaching credentials.As a player, Pirlo was renowned for his elegant style and exceptional passing range, earning him the moniker ""the maestro.""His trophy cabinet boasts an impressive collection of silverware, including a World Cup title with Italy in 2006, two Champions League titles with AC Milan, and six Serie A titles split between AC Milan and Juventus.While his playing career was characterized by brilliance and success, Pirlo's transition to management has proven to be a more arduous journey.

US Open: Botic van de Zandschulp boots out Carlos Alcaraz,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/us-open/us-open-botic-van-de-zandschulp-boots-out-carlos-alcaraz/articleshow/112939541.cms,"World No. 3 Alcaraz makes earliest

Grand Slam

exit in 3 years after shock defeat to unseeded Dutchman

Botic van de Zandschulp

Bopanna-Ebden advance

As Carlos Alcaraz exited the Arthur Ashe stadium at the end of the second set, balancing a gym bag and a whole load of emotions, he gestured aggressively at his box, where his longtime coach Juan Carlos Ferrero and agent Albert Molina sat stunned.The 21-year-old, champion at Roland Garros and Wimbledon, wagged his index finger, pointing at his head and mouthing his frustration. That scene summed up the US Open second round match in which Alcaraz made his earliest Grand Slam exit in three years.The world No. 3 went down 1-6, 5-7, 4-6 to Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp, ranked 74 in the world. The Spaniard made 27 unforced errors, 12 of which came on his forehand, the last of which punctuated his 15-match winning streak at Majors.""It was a fight against myself,"" Alcaraz said. ""In tennis you are playing against someone that wants the same as you, to win the match. You have to be as calm as you can just to think better in the match. Today I was playing against the opponent, and I was playing against myself. A lot of emotions that I couldn't control.""For the most part, Alcaraz appeared to be in a one-way conversation with his box. It was only when he broke back midway through the third set that Ferrero appeared to get into it.""I couldn't increase my level. My level stayed at the same point all the match, and it wasn't enough to win,"" the four-time major winner said. ""When I wanted to come back (to the match), it was too late.""Alcaraz came up short in his opening outing, his only tournament in the lead up to the US Open, going down to the maverick FrenchmanGael Monfils in three sets. It was his first match since his loss to Novak Djokovic in the final of the Olympic Games. Some 12 months ago, after Alcaraz fell to the Serb in the final in Cincinnati after holding a match point in the second set, the Spaniard didn't win a title again until Indian Wells in March this year. That's seven months and eight tournaments later.The third seed wasn't dotting the lines in New York late on Thursday. ""Being so close to the gold medal, it was difficult for me then,"" Alcaraz said of the Olympic final. ""But once I realized what I have achieved, it was the silver medal, it was a great achievement. I was really proud about it.""Alcaraz was weighed down by a heavy summer schedule - Roland Garros, Wimbledon, Olympics - going from clay to grass and back to clay.""The tennis schedule is so tight,"" he said. ""I've been playing a lot of matches lately, Roland Garros (title), Wimbledon (title), Olympic Games (final). I took a little break after the Olympic Games. I thought it was enough, probably it wasn't enough. I came here with not as much energy. I'm a player who needs (a bigger) break coming into important tournaments.""As much as Alcaraz's form contributed to his loss at Flushing Meadows, the 28-year-old van de Zandschulp's play proved to be sharper on the day. He struck the ball deep and close to the lines. He came in at every opportunity, disrupting the Spaniard's rhythm from the back of the court.""I think he's playing unbelievably aggressively. He's trying to come forward a lot. Today I tried to beat him to the punch a little bit. I tried to come in a lot to the net so he wasn't able to,"" van de Zandschulp said.""He's someone who can do everything. When he gets a shot on the forehand, he can drop shot, go for the winner, go inside out. He can do everything with the tennis ball. That's why facing him is unbelievably tough.""In the men's doubles, the second seeds Rohan Bopanna and Aussie Matthew Ebden put it across the Dutch pair of Robin Haase and Sander Arends 6-3, 7-5 in the first round.","World No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz loses 1-6, 5-7, 4-6 to Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp.

He goes for all kinds of shots, he's got no care in the world, it's really annoying. He's got a great serve and he has great energy out here,"" Tiafoe said.""He can come up with great shots, so can I. We both move really well, so it's just highlight after highlight. I really hope you guys enjoyed the show, four hours of this battle.""The crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium was largely silent during the opening set as the two players went through the motions after Coco Gauff had fired it up with a gutsy comeback victory.However, they came to life right away during an exciting rally in which the net cord forced both players to race to the net, and Shelton ultimately won the point when play was stopped by the referee after Tiafoe touched the net to give up a 4-1 advantage.Shelton kept the crowd entertained with his skills; he once launched himself gracefully into the air at the net for a beautiful backhand smash and then followed up to blast a cross-court forehand winner that caused everyone to gasp in unison.But in the second set, Tiafoe managed to re-enter the contest. Shelton managed to hold serve in two consecutive service games despite being down 0-40, but Tiafoe eventually converted a break point at 5-5, winning the second set.When Tiafoe made mistakes and threw over a towel bin in annoyance during the third set tiebreak, Shelton swept ahead 6-0. There wasn't much separating the two players.Shelton was on the verge of collapse as Tiafoe battled back to 6-5, but the nonchalant American sealed a 2-1 lead with the quickest serve of the tournament on his seventh set point.Even though Tiafoe was leading 5-4, Shelton had to save set points before an unintentional mistake forced a deciding. They were tied in the fourth as well.In the fifth set, Shelton gave up first, trying too hard to hit huge strokes and making mistakes that allowed Tiafoe to break and take a 4-1 lead.Without turning around, Tiafoe scored his second match point by slyly approaching the net and executing a deft volley into the open court. He then celebrated his first victory against his countryman by giving him a quick hug at the net.Tiafoe is a member of an American group that is keen to end the 21-year men's major drought and Taylor Fritz gave home aspirations even more momentum when he easily defeated Argentine Francisco Comesana to set up a match with either Casper Ruud or Shang Juncheng in the following round.Being the first American man to advance to the fourth round of all Grand Slam tournaments in a single year since Andre Agassi in 2003, the 12th seed never gave up and sent over 33 winners.",Frances Tiafoe beats Ben Shelton in four sets to reach US Open quarterfinals.

""Finally, it's the first match I won in two sets. It's not (been) easy for me to play after Olympic Games,"" she admitted. ""I'm starting to find my tennis and I start to play better and better.""Notably, Zheng drew inspiration from the enthusiastic support of Chinese fans in the stands, who chanted ""jiayou,"" which translates to ""come on"" in English.""In Chinese, saying jiayou to me, I feel a lot of energy and I feel it really brings me up,"" she explained, highlighting the positive impact of the crowd's encouragement.","Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen beats Jule Niemeier 6-2, 6-1.

It was just more the way things were going,"" said Van de Zandschulp, who was ranked 115th in April.""I got injured last year. Still had some troubles with the injury from last year. That was for me like, if I have to keep playing with the pain I had, then there was a chance maybe I would stop playing.""Of course, I would give myself to the end of the year and see how everything was progressing. Yeah, of course, there was a serious thought.""The Dutchman, who has been playing Challenger events to gradually improve his skills, will take against the British player Jack Draper in the third round and hopes to improve on his quarterfinal performance in New York three years prior.""Draper is a really good player, having a good season this year. Big serve and big strokes. So it's going to be, again, a really tough match,"" Van de Zandschulp said.""I'm looking forward to the rest of the tournament. I think everybody who is still left in the draw are amazing players. So, yeah, every match is going to be tough.""",Botic van de Zandschulp defeated Carlos Alcaraz 6-1 7-5 6-4 in the second round of the US Open.
