Thalapathy Vijay’s Jana Nayagan Gets Morning Relief, Evening Setback — Next Hearing Jan 21

NEW DELHI: In a big setback to actor Vijay, the Supreme Court on Thursday refused to entertain a plea against an order of stay passed by a division bench of the Madras high court over the certification of his movie ""Jana Nayagan"".The top court asked KVN production to raise its grievances before a division bench of the Madras HC, which is examining the issue.A bench of Justices Deepankar Datta and AG Masih asked the Madras high court to decide the matter by January 20.On January 9, the Madras high court stayed a single judge’s order directing the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) to immediately grant a censor certificate to Jana Nayagan, leaving the fate of actor-turned-politician Vijay’s film uncertain.KVN Productions LLP moved an appeal against the single judge’s directive, after a division bench of the high court last Friday put the order on hold and restrained the CBFC from issuing the certificate.Vijay recently launched his political party, the Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam.“Jana Nayagan”, widely projected as Vijay’s final film before his full-time entry into politics, was scheduled for a Pongal release on January 9.However, the release hit last-minute hurdles after the CBFC failed to issue certification in time.The division bench’s order came hours after Justice P T Asha directed the CBFC to clear “Jana Nayagan”, setting aside the film board’s decision to refer the matter to a review committee.Subsequently, the first bench comprising Chief Justice M M Shrivastava and Justice G Arul Murugan, acting on an appeal filed by the CBFC, granted an interim stay on the single judge’s verdict.Earlier, while allowing KVN Productions’ plea seeking a direction to the CBFC to issue the censor certificate, Justice Asha held that once the board had decided to grant certification, the chairperson had no authority to refer the film to a review committee.The film board immediately challenged the order before the division bench.","The top court asked KVN production to raise its grievances before a division bench of the Madras HC, which is examining the issue.

NEW DELHI: Abdul Rauf, a top-ranking commander of Lashkar-e-Taiba , has publicly acknowledged the devastating impact of the Indian military's Operation Sindoor on the group's headquarters. Addressing a fresh cohort of graduates at a ceremony in Muridke, he provided a rare and vivid account of the destruction visited upon their primary training facility during the strikes on May 6 and 7.Rauf's address focused heavily on the physical obliteration of the site, specifically referencing a structure used as a mosque that served as a central hub for the organisation. He described a scene of total ruin, noting that the building which once stood there has completely collapsed, leaving the ground unusable for their usual gatherings.""What happened on May 6-7, that place is no longer a mosque. Today, we cannot even sit there. It is finished; it has collapsed,"" he said.His testimony serves as the most detailed Lashkar confirmation yet of the significant losses in the Indian strike. This admission is particularly striking given the group's tendency to downplay or outrightly ignore operational losses in an effort to maintain an image of invulnerability.Beyond the physical wreckage, the commander also inadvertently highlighted the strategic pressure the organisation felt leading up to the strike.He revealed that the trainees participating in the graduation had actually been evacuated from the Muridke camp just moments before the Indian missiles struck.Rauf is a prominent ideological and operational leader who famously presided over the funeral rites for those killed during the initial waves of the strikes. While images of those burials had previously circulated and hinted at the severity of the casualties, Rauf's latest remarks mark the final confirmation, leaving no room for denials.","Abdul Rauf, a top-ranking commander of Lashkar-e-Taiba, has publicly acknowledged the devastating impact of the Indian military's Operation Sindoor.

BJP leader K Annamalai hit back at MNS chief Raj Thackeray, daring him to stop his entry into Mumbai, a day after Thackeray mocked him as “rasmalai” and questioned his right to comment on the city.“Who are Aaditya Thackeray and Raj Thackeray to threaten me?

Risks Involved in Signing Kyle Tucker

The Toronto Blue Jays are preparing for a major change. There are a lot of ongoing doubts around Bo Bichette and his long-term place on the roster. As a result, the club is considering free-agent outfielder Kyle Tucker as a serious replacement. What once looked like speculation has turned into a real plan that could help improve the team’s core.Toronto’s front office appears ready to move forward without waiting on Bichette talks. The priority of the team is to add a top-level bat and lock it in for years. Kyle Tucker fits that goal, and ownership has shown it is willing to spend at a level the franchise has never reached before.The Toronto Blue Jays are expected to push payroll beyond $304 million, a franchise high. Kyle Tucker’s potential deal is projected between $300 million and $418 million over ten years, keeping him under contract through his prime seasons. That would put his annual salary in the $30-40 million range.This approach stands in contrast to shorter offers on the table elsewhere, including a four-year, high-value proposal tied to the New York Mets. Toronto’s pitch is about length and stability, with possible opt-outs built in.Tucker has taken a patient approach to free agency since his time with the Chicago Cubs and Houston Astros, and the Blue Jays are matching that pace.On the field, Tucker gives Toronto what it lacks: a reliable middle-order hitter with power, patience, and strong defense in right field. Placing him alongside Vladimir Guerrero Jr. changes how opposing teams pitch and brings balance to the lineup.Off the field, the move also clears a path forward. Bichette’s trade value would likely rise, giving Toronto options rather than forcing a decision. Tucker gains long-term security and joins a team built to compete, supported by a pitching staff designed to win now.Tucker turns 29 on January 17. A long-term deal would cover ages 29 through 38. He is a four-time All-Star with a World Series title, factors that continue to drive his market value.There are real costs involved in the process of signing Tucker. Luxury tax penalties would be heavy, and Tucker missed time in 2024. Toronto also risks short-term clubhouse tension as Bichette’s situation plays out. Playing in a colder market than New York or Los Angeles is another factor.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Los Angeles Dodgers could bag $240 million Toronto Blue Jays superstar and here's why Even so, this move would signal a clear direction. Tucker becomes a central piece, Bichette likely moves on, and the Blue Jays position themselves to challenge the top teams in the American League for years to come.","Toronto Blue Jays considering free-agent outfielder Kyle Tucker as a replacement for Bo Bichette.

What happened to Victor Wembanyama in the San Antonio Spurs Vs. Milwaukee Bucks Game?



Victor Wembanyama enters the Spurs game against the Bucks with a new haircut



The San Antonio Spurs were forced into an uneasy wait on Thursday night after Victor Wembanyama exited early against the Milwaukee Bucks. The game is crucial for both teams in the Western Conference race, but the concern arose when the Spurs’ franchise star headed to the locker room within the opening minutes.Wembanyama’s status quickly became the central storyline inside the arena. With no immediate update from the team, all eyes turned to the bench as San Antonio continued play without its most impactful presence on the floor.The injury occurred with 9:18 remaining in the first quarter. While defending a driving Giannis Antetokounmpo near the basket, Victor Wembanyama appeared to make knee-to-knee contact. He dropped to the floor, grabbed his right knee, and showed visible discomfort before rising.Wembanyama limped off the court unassisted and moved quickly toward the locker room. Members of the Spurs medical staff followed, along with Spurs CEO R.C. Buford. The team later listed him as questionable to return, though no further details were shared during the game.The play sparked concern due to recent history. On December 31, Wembanyama suffered a hyperextended knee against the New York Knicks on a similar sequence.He returned to the bench that night but missed the next two games. Thursday’s incident looked eerily familiar, even as the Spurs avoided speculation and waited for medical evaluation.San Antonio entered the matchup at 27-13, while Milwaukee arrived at 17-23. The Spurs have managed Wembanyama’s workload carefully this season after he missed multiple weeks earlier, making any knee-related issue an immediate priority.Before the injury scare, Wembanyama had already drawn attention for a different reason. He arrived with a shaved head, a look that sparked conversation across the league. The change followed San Antonio’s recent blowout loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder.According to Keldon Johnson, the decision came from a shared moment between teammates. “Vic was like, ‘Yo, let’s bald our head.’ And I was like, ‘Let’s do it,'” Johnson said. “I was trying to make sure everything went smooth, take my time…I had to fade it up a little bit at first. Then I gave him a little bowl cut and then we went from there.”The haircut carried echoes of Wembanyama’s offseason in China, where he trained with Shaolin monks and shaved his head during that period. He previously described that experience as putting his “body through things that it’s not used to doing and allowing my range of movement and strength.”That phase coincided with one of the most productive stretches of his career. After starting the 2025-26 season, Wembanyama averaged 24 points, 11 rebounds, and 3 assists.Also Read: New York Knicks injury update: How long Jalen Brunson may be sidelined after ankle sprain",Victor Wembanyama limped off in the first quarter against the Milwaukee Bucks.

Samson Nacua's case closes as a misunderstanding, while Puka Nacua shifts focus to the Rams' playoff showdown



A legal case tied to a high-profile mix of NFL and NBA names has taken a decisive turn in Los Angeles. Samson Nacua, the brother of Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua, has received a major update following his December arrest involving a luxury SUV owned by Los Angeles Lakers forward Adou Thiero. What initially appeared to be a serious charge has now been reframed after further review by law enforcement.Authorities revisited the incident weeks after the arrest and reached a conclusion. The development brings clarity to the situation. The arrest drew widespread attention due to the names involved and the unusual circumstances surrounding the vehicle’s disappearance.According to law enforcement officials in Los Angeles, investigators determined the incident stemmed from a misunderstanding rather than criminal intent. Samson Nacua and Trey Rose were arrested after driving away in Thiero’s BMW without permission, leading to charges of taking a vehicle without the owner’s consent.After reviewing the facts, deputies concluded that Samson believed the SUV belonged to a family member. The Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department explained the reasoning behind the decision not to move forward. “He believed the vehicle was his brother’s since his brother has the exact same model vehicle (only a year or two older) and the same color,” the department told TMZ.“The case was submitted for reject. The victim does not wish to prosecute as well,” the sheriff’s department added. The update was first reported by NBC 4 Los Angeles, confirming that no charges will be pursued.The SUV was tracked to the One Hotel on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood, where the suspects had valeted the vehicle before entering the property. Deputies identified both men through security footage and later made the arrests. With the investigation now complete, the matter is effectively closed.Samson Nacua’s name gained traction largely due to his family connection, though he has his own football background. He has played professionally in both the USFL and UFL. Most recently, Samson suited up for the Michigan Panthers during the 2025 season.As for Puka Nacua, he is focused on football. The Rams receiver is preparing for a postseason matchup with high stakes, as Los Angeles faces the Chicago Bears with a trip to the NFC Championship on the line.Adou Thiero also decided not to press charges, which brought resolution to the case. Investigators emphasized that the lack of intent and cooperation from all parties played a role in closing the case.Also Read: Is Victor Wembanyama alright?

(Image via: Kike Hernandez's IG Story)

For a player whose career has been defined by big hits, postseason pressure, and high-energy moments on the diamond, Kiké Hernández’s latest Instagram Story shifted attention to something far more personal. The MLB star shared a soft, family-focused image of his daughter Penelope, accompanied by the caption, “The princess turns 5 days.”The post was brief but deeply warm, offering fans a glimpse into a quieter side of his life. In an era where athletes often highlight only their professional achievements online, Hernández’s update stood out for its simplicity.Kiké Hernández and his wife, Mariana Vicente, became parents in January 2021 when they welcomed their daughter Penelope Isabel. At the time, Hernández marked the moment with an emotional Instagram announcement that revealed just how profoundly fatherhood changed his perspective on life and success.“01.15.21! Penélope Isabel was born at 4:28pm. BEST DAY OF MY LIFE!!!” Hernández wrote while sharing photos of himself with his newborn daughter. He reflected on the biggest milestones of his professional journey, from being drafted to making his Major League debut and winning the World Series, before admitting that none of those moments compared to becoming a father.“The day I got drafted I thought I was on top of the world, the day I made my Big League debut I thought nothing would compare, the day I got married I felt like the world stopped, the day we won the World Series I thought I had it all; NOTHING compares to the moment when I met my little girl!!”That sense of gratitude and emotional grounding has remained a consistent theme in Hernández’s life ever since. Later in 2021, Vicente offered her own heartfelt tribute on Father’s Day, giving fans a glimpse into their family dynamic away from baseball. “Witnessing you become a dad is one of the best feelings in the world!” she wrote. “You really are the funnest (and finest 🤤) most loving girl dad. We are so lucky.”Currently, the Hernandez family is preparing for another meaningful chapter. The couple will have a second child in this year. Although Hernandez keeps on appending chapters to his career in the MLB, incidents such as this make fans remember that his most treasured achievements are at home, influenced by family, love, and soft celebrations in a series of posts one by one.","Kiké Hernández shared a soft, family-focused image of his daughter Penelope.

Nathan Lukes’ journey from the minor-league grind to steady MLB earnings between 2016 and 2026



For Nathan Lukes, success in Major League Baseball did not come quickly or easily. His path has been defined by patience, adaptability, and a willingness to keep pushing through long seasons away from the spotlight. Drafted in the later rounds, Lukes entered professional baseball knowing every opportunity would have to be earned.Financial stability was not immediate, and his early years were shaped by modest minor-league earnings. Under the Toronto Blue Jays, however, Lukes has now used years of preparation to attain a meaningful role, and his net worth timeline of 2016-2026 represents a career of constant advancement as opposed to early hype.Between 2016 and 2019, Lukes spent his seasons in minor leagues where he was not well-paid but was compelled to grow. He emphasized on making himself a regular hitter, enhance his on-base abilities and adding some flexibility in his defense around the field. Although his net worth was not increasing as rapidly at this time, his dependability continued to keep him advancing in the professional baseball arena.Lukes then proceeded with refining his game between 2020 and 2022 but coping with organizational changes.This was his breakthrough year, as in 2022, during Triple-A at Buffalo, he demonstrated all-around offensive output and a quickness on the bases, which put his name squarely on the Toronto radar. The performance got him a place on the 40-man roster of the Blue Jays and this was a definite change in opportunity and earning power.Lukes first made it to the majors in 2023, when he became formally listed on the payroll of the major league. Constant injuries and roster rivalry restricted his action both in 2023 and 2024, though both efforts provided financial security and experience. This was reinforced by his good performance in the end of the 2024 season which was marked by his first home run in his career.In 2025, Lukes earned a pre-arbitration salary of $720,000, and this has further increased his tally in net worth, which is estimated to be $397,099 ( according to Salary Sports). In 2026, continued service time and consistent production could further raise his earnings. Nathan Lukes’ story is a reminder that in baseball, persistence can be just as valuable as raw talent.","Nathan Lukes’ journey from the minor-league grind to steady MLB earnings between 2016 and 2026. Under the Toronto Blue Jays, Lukes has used years of preparation to attain a meaningful role. His net worth timeline of 2016-2026 represents a career of constant advancement as opposed to early hype.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126556567,imgsize-78430,width-400,resizemode-4/nathan-lukes.jpg"

Jack Eichel's and Mitch Marner 's timely scoring punches added to Vegas Golden Knights' historic win

Golden Knights vs. Kings | NHL Highlights | January 14, 2026

Mark Stone scored just 25 seconds into overtime as the Vegas Golden Knights overcame the Los Angeles Kings with a score of 3-2. The win marked a successful performance for the team, extending their win streak to five as they continue to rise in the NHL playoff standings.Mark Stone capped the scoring with a goal and an assist, while Jack Eichel contributed three assists as Vegas extended its record to 22-11-12. Akira Schmid recorded 22 saves for the Golden Knights, who are now 5-0-1 within the current six games. The Los Angeles team got a point but yet struggled again in sealing victories for a closely contested match.The game-winning moment happened rapidly in overtime. Jack Eichel led a rush into the offensive zone, putting pressure on Kings goaltender Darcy Kuemper to commit. The Golden Knights seem to be leaning on their top line for many of the chances they are getting during this winning streak, with Stone and Eichel often getting into the danger area of the ice.The Vegas Golden Knights opened the scoring about a third of the way through the second period as Braeden Bowman snapped a wrist shot over Kuemper’s left shoulder. The goal ended a 17-game goal-scoring drought for Bowman and illustrated the depth of the Vegas roster, one that extends beyond its stars.The Kings tied it early in the third period, but Mitch Marner scored again at 12:07 with a wrist shot into the far corner after he skated into the slot.“I kind of had a lot of time to decide what I was going to do, so at first there, I was deciding to maybe take a slap shot, maybe get a tip play,"" Marner said. ""And then I saw both guys go to (Tomas) Hertl and (Ivan Barbashev), so I kind of walked in and was lucky enough to pick my spot.""Eichel assisted on all three Vegas goals and extended his point streak to six games. The Golden Knights and Kings have also reached a total of 18 overtime games this season, a league-high number, indicating just how small a matter winning or losing is at this stage of the playoff competition.Also read: Vegas Golden Knights and Mark Stone look to extend their winning streak as they welcome St. Louis Blues","Mark Stone scored just 25 seconds into overtime as the Vegas Golden Knights overcame the Los Angeles Kings with a score of 3-2.

The United Arab Emirates are set to create history next month by competing at the Winter Olympics for the first time!

Their participation was officially announced on Thursday during a press conference at the UAE National Olympic Committee headquarters in Dubai, confirming a breakthrough moment for winter sports in the country.Hamel Al Qubaisi, vice-president of the UAE Winter Sports Federation, described the announcement as the result of years of effort. He said the federation is proud of the progress made and excited to see Emirati athletes compete on the Olympic stage. He added that the UAE’s participation in the 2026 Winter Olympic Games is a historic achievement and shows that sport in the country is not limited by geography or climate, but driven by ambition and a vision for global excellence.The opening ceremony will be unique, with events taking place across four locations. Estridge will carry the UAE flag in Milan, while Hudson will serve as flagbearer in Cortina, underlining the significance of the moment for both athletes.Estridge, who is just 19, is a prodigy of the UAE’s growing winter sports system. He learned to ski at Ski Dubai and first took up the sport at the age of three. He later began racing competitively and has represented the UAE at several youth events. Speaking last year, he explained that he has lived in Dubai his whole life, learned to ski locally, raced for the first time at seven, and recently competed at the Youth Olympics in Gangwon.Hudson, 29, brings international experience to the team. She previously represented New Zealand before switching her sporting nationality to the UAE in June 2025.Al Qubaisi also pointed to earlier achievements, including participation in the Winter Youth Olympic Games 2024, the Special Olympics World Winter Games Turin 2025, and the Asian Winter Games 2025.

From Olympic gold to global business icon, Anthony Joshua's financial journey



Anthony Joshua has turned his boxing success into a legacy. From Olympic hero to global superstar, his rise over the past decade has been steady and powerful. Now, the British star is not only known for knockouts. He is also known for smart contracts, big-brand deals, and careful business moves. His net worth growth reflects consistency at the top level of sport.As of now, Anthony Joshua’s estimated net worth stands at around $150 million (per celebrity net worth). Some reports suggest it could rise closer to $200 million after his recent mega fights. His paycheques come from huge fight purses, global endorsements, and business investments. Joshua is now one of the richest boxers in the world.Anthony Joshua’s big payday journey began after his gold medal win at the 2012 London Olympics. By 2016, his professional career was booming. He won world titles and quickly became a box office star. His early title fights earned him millions and pushed his net worth into the tens of millions.The defining moment came in April 2017. Joshua defeated Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley Stadium.The fight made him a global name. It also delivered one of his first massive paydays. From that point, Joshua became a stadium fighter who could sell out any venue.Between 2017 and 2018, Joshua defended his titles against Carlos Takam, Joseph Parker, and Alexander Povetkin. Each fight brought eight-figure earnings. Sponsors followed. Brands like Under Armour, Beats by Dre, and Hugo Boss signed major deals with him. His clean image and athletic build made him highly marketable.In 2019, Joshua reached a financial peak. Although he lost to Andy Ruiz Jr. in June, the rematch later that year changed everything. He earned a reported $57.5 million in Saudi Arabia. This became the biggest payday of his career at the time. His net worth jumped sharply after that fight.Anthony Joshua faced setbacks in 2021 and 2022 with losses to Oleksandr Usyk. Still, the money kept flowing. His second fight against Usyk alone earned him over $40 million. Even in defeat, Joshua remained one of boxing’s highest-paid stars.From 2023 onward, Joshua rebuilt both his career and brand. Wins over Jermaine Franklin and Robert Helenius kept him active. In March 2024, he knocked out Francis Ngannou and earned around $50 million. This single fight added significantly to his wealth.By late 2025, reports claimed Joshua had earned over $195 million in total career income. His December 2025 fight vs Jake Paul was another big payday. This pushed his net worth toward $150 million.Outside the ring, Joshua has invested in real estate and business ventures through his company, 258 Group. These assets give him income beyond boxing. From 2016 to 2026, Anthony Joshua built his net worth with power and smart planning.Also Read: Kamaru Usman faces fans wrath after he releases video of Anthony Joshua’s emotional private call after tragic Nigeria crash","Anthony Joshua is one of the richest boxers in the world.

India vs New Zealand: 'Ravindra Jadeja needs to look at his form or...'

Former Indian cricketer Manoj Tiwary has voiced his disappointment over the recent public spat involving legendary boxer Mary Kom and her ex-husband, Karung Onkholer Kom, which has captured national attention.Speaking in a video post, Tiwary said he was deeply hurt by Mary Kom’s comments on Aap Ki Adalat, where she stated, “To be honest, he married me, and he got everything from my earning. He did not earn a single rupee.” Tiwary noted that while he has no personal connection to the matter, he is aware of the strong support systems behind national-level athletes. “As a former player, I know how much a support system matters. In Mary Kom’s case, her husband had played a significant role in her journey,” he said.Tiwary recalled that Mary Kom herself had previously acknowledged that Onkholer supported her while she trained, looked after their children, and managed other responsibilities. He expressed concern over the impact of her remarks on her ex-husband’s mental state. “To publicly humiliate someone on national television after the relationship has ended is alarming. I fear for his mental well-being,” Tiwari added.He went on to stress that in any relationship, both partners contribute in different ways at different times, and expressed gratitude for the support he has received from his own wife. “Through this video, I salute all husbands and wives who act as a strong support system for each other,” he concluded.The couple had formally separated over two years ago, completing a customary divorce under the Kom community law on December 20, 2023. Mary Kom has alleged financial misconduct by her ex-husband, claiming she lost crores of rupees, land purchased with her earnings, and that loans were taken against her property. Onkholer has denied the claims, saying he lives in a rented house in Delhi and challenging her to provide proof.While Mary Kom has stated that she does not seek police action and only wants the matter resolved, the issue continues to stir debate across social media and news platforms. Tiwary later deleted the video.","Former Indian cricketer Manoj Tiwary has voiced his disappointment over the recent public spat involving legendary boxer Mary Kom and her ex-husband, Karung Onkholer Kom.

Allan Donald on Virat Kohli’s legacy: Can he reach 100 centuries?

NAVI MUMBAI: 24 hours can be a long time in sport. A day after she was retired out while batting on 47 off 36 balls in a debatable decision by UP Warriorz head coach Abhishek Nayar, a fired-up Harleen Deol cracked a scintillating 64 not out off just 39 balls, which included 12 gloriously-timed fours, to star in her team’s morale-boosting seven-wicket over the Mumbai Indians at the DY Patil Stadium on Thursday night.Not only did Harleen ‘troll’ Nayar, who was seen applauding her every shot, with her classy display, she also played a stellar role in UPW’s first win in WPL-2026 after three defeats. They are still at the bottom of the five-team table, but UPW will take heart from the win, while MI are at the second spot with two wins and an equal number of defeats.Starting off with her first three scoring shots being fours, the India batter kept peppering the off-side boundary-10 of her fours were in that direction. While she isn’t a power-hitter, the 27-year-old relies more on her sublime timing and wonderful ability to thread gaps in the field.Looking determined to prove her worth, Harleen, a part of India's 2025 ODI World Cup winning team, added 73 in 49 balls with Aussie Phoebe Litchfield (25, 22b, 2x4, 1x6) for the third wicket, and then 44* for the fourth wicket with South African allrounder Chloe Tryon (27 not out, 11b, 4x4, 1x6) in just 20 balls as UPW cantered home with 11 balls to spare.Besides striking some fine blows in the end to help UP reach the 162-run target, Tryon took two catches- the one of MI’s in-form captain Harmanpreet Kaur 916, 11b, 1x4, 1x6), a brilliant diving effort at square leg off leggie Asha Shobhana-proving to be decisive.Earlier, MI’s openers Amanjot Kaur (38, 33b, 7x4) and ‘keeper-bat Gunalan Kamalini (5, 12b) took 44 balls while adding 43, managing just 32 in the Powerplay-the lowest in WPL-2026 so far. UPW kept things tight, with both their pacers Shikha Pandey (1-25 in four overs) and Kranti Goud (0-28 in four overs), who was bowled out at the start, delivering a fine opening spell. Both Kaur, who at least got a few boundaries, and Kamlini, who looks out of place at this level, eventually holed out.Harmanpreet, currently the top run-getter in the fourth season of the Women’s Premier League, endured a rare failure.However, it was the perfect time for Sciver-Brunt, returning in this game after missing the last match due to illness, to show off her class. Taking the responsibility of steering MI to a good total on her broad shoulders, the England captain slammed a sublime 65 off 43 balls, with her knock adorned by nine fours and a six.Sciver-Brunt found an able ally in MI’s new recruit, Australian allrounder Nicola Carey, who smashed a quickfire 32 (20b, 5x4) as the duo added 85 off just 44 balls in a fourth wicket partnership which gave MI’s innings wings and fuel at the perfect time. The duo’s fireworks helped MI, who were crawling at 54 for two after 10 overs, plunder 93 off their last eight overs after they got just 68 off the first 12. They eventually managed to put up a par total of 161 for five in 20 overs.Letting it loose, the English/Aussie duo squeezed out 33 runs in two overs-the 15th and the 16th-to give some much-needed impetus to the MI innings.If Nat-Sciver smashed two fours (both savage pull shots) a six down the ground off Shobana, collecting 17 in the 15th over, Carey took four fours off Tryon in the 16th over.",Harleen Deol scores 64 not out in UP Warriorz's seven-wicket win over Mumbai Indians. Deol was retired out while batting on 47 off 36 balls in a debatable decision by head coach Abhishek Nayar.

Kevin Durant calls Aaron Rodgers a “generational athlete”

Mike Tomlin’s departure adds more uncertainty

Also Read:

As speculation around Aaron Rodgers’ future continues to grow, an unexpected individual has stepped into the conversation. NBA superstar Kevin Durant has offered his perspective on the veteran quarterback’s next move, urging fans and critics alike to appreciate the bigger picture rather than rush to conclusions.Rodgers’ 2025 season with the Pittsburgh Steelers ended on a difficult note. A one-sided Wild Card loss to the Houston Texans reignited questions about whether the four-time NFL MVP has reached the end of his playing days.Speaking on the Up & Adams Show, Durant made it clear that he views Rodgers’ situation through a wider lens. The NBA star stressed that playing at an elite level for more than two decades is rare, especially at a demanding position like quarterback.Durant pointed out that longevity itself deserves respect. In his view, Rodgers’ 21-year NFL journey speaks volumes about his discipline, preparation, and commitment to the game. Whether Rodgers returns for another season or decides to retire, Durant believes his career should not be judged by one disappointing playoff performance.The debate around Rodgers’ future intensified after Pittsburgh’s early playoff exit.The loss not only ended the Steelers’ season but also raised doubts about whether the team is ready to compete at a high level again in the near future.Rodgers, now 42, has not officially announced any decision. He has stated publicly that he does not want to make an “emotional decision” and prefers to take time before deciding whether his body and mindset are ready for another long NFL season.The uncertainty surrounding him increased further after Mike Tomlin stepped down as Steelers head coach. Rodgers reportedly joined Pittsburgh largely because of his respect for Tomlin, and the coach’s exit has left major questions about the team’s future direction.With the Steelers beginning a search for a new head coach, it remains unclear what role he would play if he chooses to return. A leadership change often signals a shift in philosophy, and that could influence the quarterback’s final decision.Durant also pushed back against the idea that Rodgers would disappear from public life if he retires. He suggested that Rodgers’ competitive nature and discipline would carry over into whatever comes next, whether that is media, business, or another football-related role.For now, Rodgers’ future remains unresolved. But as Durant’s comments highlight, the focus may be better placed on appreciating one of football’s most accomplished careers rather than rushing toward a conclusion.",Kevin Durant calls Aaron Rodgers a “generational athlete’ Mike Tomlin’s departure adds more uncertainty about Rodgers’ future.

What is the “expensive poo” incident in F1? All about Carlos Sainz’s costly and comical moment on the track,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/formula-one/news/what-is-the-expensive-poo-incident-in-f1-all-about-carlos-sainzs-costly-and-comical-moment-on-the-track/articleshow/126552363.cms,"Carlos Sainz (Image Source: Getty)

Why has it become known as the 'expensive poo'?

FIA rules, driver backlash, and wider debate

Formula 1 is a sport of split-second accuracy, drama, and colossal fines, but a few stories have been as bizarre and discussed as the case of Carlos Sainz in Japan in 2025 during a Grand Prix. When the Williams driver was fined by the FIA for failing to sing the national anthem on the grid at Suzuka, the incident was immediately memed, joked about, and turned into a hot, debatable topic all over the paddock and in the media.Sainz gave the reason that he had been experiencing some sudden stomach problems just before the pre-race anthem, and he was rushed to the hospital, which made him arrive a few seconds late. Although stewards admitted the extenuating circumstances, a doctor confirmed the discomfort. Still, he incurred a 20,000-euro penalty under FIA rules for punctuality at official ceremonies, but later, that fine was suspended for no repeat offences.The case itself became a living one courtesy of comments from other drivers and commentators. Mercedes driver George Russell, who is also the representative of the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association, jokingly said that Sainz's bathroom break had become a pretty expensive poo and that this was the ridiculousness of the situation when the call of nature conflicted with strict F1 procedures.Sainz himself responded publicly, calling the fine disproportionate because it stemmed from a five-second delay. He even joked about possible other fines after making swears during the press remarks regarding the entire affair, another rule that the FIA had become stricter on in 2025.Although it is a funny side story in the history of Formula 1, the incident involving the expensive poo highlighted the serious debate about how much regulation and reality go hand in hand in Formula 1, and that even the use of the loo can become a headliner.Along with the jokes, the incident sparked an intense discussion in Formula 1. Drivers challenged the need to enforce ceremonial rules to an extreme, leaving human realities with no space. The Grand Prix Drivers Association openly defended Sainz, saying there should be greater discretion in health-related situations.Although the incident will be remembered with a smile, it also made the tension between rigid rules and reasonable justice in modern Formula 1 clear: even an incident off-track can have an impact on the sport.Also read: F1 fans hail Max Verstappen as he is set to mark 10 years since becoming youngest Grand Prix winner","Williams driver Carlos Sainz was fined by the FIA for failing to sing the national anthem on the grid at Suzuka in 2025.

NHL Update: Erik Gudbranson returns to Columbus Blue Jackets after long hip injury absence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-update-erik-gudbranson-returns-to-columbus-blue-jackets-after-long-hip-injury-absence/articleshow/126552032.cms,"Erik Gudbranson (Image Via Getty Images)

What does Erik Gudbranson’s return mean for Columbus Blue Jackets’ defense?

After a long absence, Erik Gudbranson is now almost ready to put on the Blue Jackets jersey again. The Columbus Blue Jackets have brought the experienced defenseman back from the injured list, paving the way for him to play against the Vancouver Canucks on Thursday night. Coming back after a long rehabilitation, the coming back of the player's return is now considered as giving the team a familiar face instead of rushing him back.The Blue Jackets have confirmed the return of Gudbranson from injured reserve, and he will likely play. The 34-year-old has not been on the ice since the end of October due to chronic hip problems that required a long time off. His non-participation brought about a reshuffling of Columbus’s defensive combinations in their attempt to hold their own, and now the return of Gudbranson seems like a planned move rather than just a pushing back of the deadline.On November 6, defenseman Erik Gudbranson was placed on injured reserve, missing 38 games in a row, which makes him the longest absent player on the team. During his very brief stay on the ice, he was given a minus-two rating, with an average of almost 15 minutes of ice time being his average. However, his contribution was never intended to be in the offensive area. The Blue Jackets appreciate him for his physical strength and capability to keep the situation calm in his zone.This reappearance also has a significant personal meaning. The previous season was another tough one since Gudbranson could participate in only 16 games after undergoing shoulder surgery. Now that he is in the last year of his $4 million contract, which was signed in July 2022, the veteran player will be determined to make a significant contribution, especially in the final part of the season.Columbus is coming into this game with a record of 20 wins, 19 losses, and 7 overtime defeats, which puts them in the seventh position in the Metropolitan Division, and they are seven points behind a wild-card spot.The return of Gudbranson will not have an immediate impact on the standings, but it will provide the Blue Jackets with something they have been missing for a long time: a solid and known character on the defense. Sometimes, that is more important than the stats.Also Read: Trevor Zegras Net Worth Timeline (2016–2026): From career growth to salary, endorsements, and more","Erik Gudbranson has been out since the end of October with chronic hip problems.

Patrick Mahomes keeps low profile as Brittany Mahomes celebrates milestone amid uncertain recovery period,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/patrick-mahomes-keeps-low-profile-as-brittany-mahomes-celebrates-milestone-amid-uncertain-recovery-period/articleshow/126503485.cms,"Patrick Mahomes is staying largely out of the public eye as he continues his rehab following a season-ending knee injury. While his recovery timeline remains uncertain, his wife Brittany recently shared a family milestone, drawing attention to the quieter phase of Mahomes’ career as he balances healing, home life, and preparation for his return.

Patrick Mahomes watching playoffs from home sparks unease as personal priorities shift

For the first time in his professional life, Patrick Mahomes is watching the NFL playoffs from home. The moment feels unfamiliar, even jarring, for a quarterback who has defined January football for nearly a decade. Yet while the Kansas City Chiefs move forward without him, Mahomes has quietly shifted his focus to healing, family, and milestones that matter far beyond the field.The timing is bittersweet. A devastating knee injury ended his season early, but it also created rare space. Space to recover. Space to slow down. And space to be fully present at home with his wife Brittany Mahomes and their three young children. As his rehab intensifies, life off the field continues to move quickly and joyfully..Patrick Mahomes suffered a torn ACL and LCL late in Week 15 and underwent reconstructive surgery shortly after returning to Texas. His goal is clear. He wants to be ready for Week 1 of the 2026 season.Chiefs head coach Andy Reid offered reassurance on Mahomes’ progress, saying, “First of all, he’s doing great for just being three weeks out or so.” Reid added, “He’ll go ahead and most likely stay up here (in Kansas City) for the majority of the time rehabbing… and he’s just been in there grinding.”While Mahomes works through rehab, his family marked a major personal milestone. The couple celebrated the first birthday of their youngest daughter, Golden Raye.Brittany shared moments from the day, writing, “Celebrated our Golden girl with the best crew.” The celebration included cake, laughter, and a surprise moment when Golden appeared to take her first steps, drawing cheers from family members in attendance.Brittany recently addressed whether baby No. 4 could be in the future. “Nope,” she said. “We’re done. We’re done for a while. Three. I don’t know, I mean I feel like you can never like say you’re done, but I think three is all I need.” Mahomes echoed that sentiment earlier, saying, “We’ll see down the line, maybe. But my goal was always three.”For now, the Mahomes family is embracing this unexpected pause. Football will return. Right now, recovery and family come first.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes trade rumors: Chiefs fans stunned as rebuild talk turns extreme","Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is recovering from a season- ending knee injury.

Kirk Cousins joins playoff coverage on television

Future with the Falcons in question

Also Read:

The Atlanta Falcons may be out of the playoff race, but Kirk Cousins has still found a way to stay connected to the NFL’s biggest stage. After Atlanta narrowly missed out on postseason football, the veteran quarterback is set to be part of the playoffs in a very different role this year.The Falcons finished the 2025 regular season with an 8-9 record, just short of qualification. Despite a late push, inconsistency at quarterback and key injuries proved costly. For Cousins, it marked another frustrating chapter in what has been a turbulent stint with the Atlanta Falcons. Still, the 37-year-old is not stepping away from the spotlight.Cousins will appear in the broadcast studio. He has been named a guest analyst for CBS Sports during the Divisional Round and the AFC Championship Game. He will feature on “The NFL Today,” offering insight and analysis alongside the network’s regular panel.The move comes after former Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan left his role at CBS to become Atlanta’s president of football operations. Cousins stepping into that seat feels like a natural transition, especially given his reputation as one of the league’s more thoughtful and articulate quarterbacks.This is not Cousins’ first time in television. He has previously appeared as a guest analyst during playoff broadcasts and featured prominently in football documentaries.His ability to explain complex plays in simple terms has often stood out, making him a comfortable fit in the studio environment.Cousins’ on-field future, however, remains uncertain. He signed a massive contract with the Falcons, but his role shifted throughout the season. After being benched earlier in the year, he returned to the lineup late and helped Atlanta remain competitive. Even so, the Falcons ultimately fell short.With Atlanta entering another period of transition, including changes in the front office and coaching staff, Cousins’ long-term place with the team will be decided in the coming months. A reworked contract gives both sides flexibility, and March is expected to be a key moment for clarity.Despite his growing media presence, Cousins has made it clear that he still wants to play in 2026. The playoff analyst role is not a retirement signal, but rather a way to stay engaged with the game during the offseason window.For now, Cousins will watch the postseason unfold from a studio desk instead of the sideline. It may not be the ending he wanted with the Falcons, but it ensures his voice and his football mind remain part of the NFL playoff conversation.","Kirk Cousins has been named a guest analyst for CBS Sports during the Divisional Round and the AFC Championship Game.

How will Mitch Marner react to facing his former Toronto Maple Leafs team for the first time?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/how-will-mitch-marner-react-to-facing-his-former-toronto-maple-leafs-team-for-the-first-time/articleshow/126552920.cms,"Mitch Marner (Image Via Getty Images)

Why is this game emotionally significant for Mitch Marner?



Mitch Marner never thought this moment would come so soon. After nine seasons with the Toronto Maple Leafs, the 28-year-old forward is now about to play against his former team for the first time in his NHL career. Although Marner, playing for the Vegas Golden Knights, stepped onto the ice for Thursday night’s game, knowing it has more significance than a regular-season game, he is still trying to treat it like any other game.The match will take place in Las Vegas tonight at 9:30 p.m ET, where Marner and the Golden Knights are welcoming the Maple Leafs just days after an overtime victory over the Los Angeles Kings. When asked how he would handle the situation, Marner answered that he would not overthink and would concentrate on his game. However, the organization that picked him fourth overall in 2015 is sure to stir up feelings.Mitch Marner had been one of the most gifted and controversial players in the Toronto franchise’s history during his stay. NHL.com reports that he ended his career with the Leafs with 741 points in 657 games, which made him one of the top scorers in the team’s history. Even with his impressive regular-season numbers, he still received criticism from the fans and the media due to his poor performance during the playoffs and his team’s early elimination.Mitch Marner, after Toronto’s second-round playoff defeat to the Florida Panthers last spring, decided it was time to undergo a change. Following a report by ESPN’s Mark Masters, he inked a massive eight-year, $96 million deal with Vegas that was a part of a sign-and-trade deal. Darryl Sittler, the Maple Leafs icon, praised Marner later as a complete player and confessed that his absence would be felt in Toronto.The adjustment of Marner with the Golden Knights is still ongoing, as he has scored 47 points in 45 matches so far. The head coach, Bruce Cassidy, said that emotions could sometimes slow down the players when they face their previous teams, but he believes that Marner's experience will help him go through this moment more easily.There is no way to quantify this game in terms of numbers or narratives.

“No accountability”

“Mount Rushmore”

Kai Cenat confronts Twitch CEO Dan Clancy over Mount Rushmore comments

“clipping culture”





Kai Cenat is back in the headlines for a new controversy, after he uploaded unseen footage of a tense encounter with Twitch CEO Dan Clancy. The video was taken during the Streamer Awards of 2025, where it was uploaded by Kai with a caption that read. The leaked video reopened a debate that began months earlier, when Clancy made comments about Twitch’sof streamers during an appearance on Mizkif’s stream. Those remarks appeared to downplay Kai’s status compared to older, more established creators.The issue traces back to October 2025, when Clancy initially told Kai face to face during Mafiathon 3 that he belonged on the platform’s Mount Rushmore. Later, on Mizkif’s stream, Clancy changed his tone, saying he only included Kai because Kai had asked him directly. This shift upset Kai, who felt the Twitch CEO had contradicted himself and failed to take responsibility for what he had said earlier.In the leaked footage, Clancy approaches Kai to explain himself, claiming that the viral clip from Mizkif’s stream was edited and taken out of context. He says the conversation was more about how people define Mount Rushmore, arguing that it usually highlights historical figures rather than current top performers. Clancy added that if the list focused on who is at their peak right now, creators like Kai Cenat and IShowSpeed would clearly be at the top.Kai hit back hard, saying Clancy was a liar who changed his story to suit the situation. He said Clancy had told Mizkif that Kai was only included because he asked, which completely contradicted what he had said earlier.The moment quickly became a flashpoint for wider debate within the streaming community.Reactions were mixed. Mizkif defended Clancy, blamingfor creating confusion and noting that the CEO had still praised Kai as one of the greatest streamers. Meanwhile, Kick executive Andrew Santamaria used the drama to publicly recruit Kai. Reddit users were split, with some calling the feud unnecessary and others criticizing Clancy’s handling of the situation.In the end, the controversy highlights ongoing tensions between platform leadership and top creators, showing how quickly private conversations can turn into public disputes in the streaming world.Also Read: IShowSpeed makes streaming history with first-ever live stream inside Egypt’s Great Pyramid","Kai Cenat uploaded unseen footage of a tense encounter with Twitch CEO Dan Clancy.

What were Sidney Crosby's major investments between 2016 and 2026

Also Read:

Sidney Crosby is easily one of the greatest hockey players of all time. From his dominance in the NHL with the Pittsburgh Penguins to his winning back-to-back gold with Team Canada at the Olympics, he has been sensational for the past 20 years.But between him leading the Penguins to consecutive Stanley Cups in 2016 and 2017 to him surpassing franchise legend Mario Lemieux's record for being the all-time in points, more than a decade has passed. And in those ten years, not only his accolades but also his wealth has grown substantially. As the hockey world evolves financially, his decade-old decisions make it feel that 2026 is the new 2016 for business prospects.Since being drafted #1 overall by the Penguins at the 2005 NHL Draft, Crosby has remained the centerpiece of the franchise. His importance to the team also meant some of the biggest NHL contracts of all time. While his three-year $11.1 entry-level contract had an AAV of $3.7 million, his annual cap hit was just $850,000.But that soon changed. By the time he won his first Stanley Cup in 2009, he had re-signed with the Penguins with a 5-year, $43.5 million extension.But this was only the beginning. By 2016, he had signed the second-largest NHL contract of all time at that point.With a 12-year, $104.4 million deal to his name, he was climbing fast on the list of highest-earning NHL players of all time. In fact, he had $15.4 million in earnings in the 2016-17 season alone from a combination of his NHL salary, performance bonuses, and endorsement deals.As of January 2026, he remains one of the highest-paid NHL players of all time. His current net worth stands at $75 million. That's a $20 million rise from his $55 million net worth back in 2016. But since then, Crosby has signed his latest deal with the Penguins.Crosby signed a two-year, $17.4 million deal with Pittsburgh at an AAV of $8.7 million, which will again add to his total career earnings. He already crossed a significant milestone in June 2021 when he crossed franchise legend Jaromir Jagr’s career earnings total of $127 million.It was already $129 million by then. A sharp rise from the humble $46.9 million in 2016. But that figure pales in comparison to his current earnings total of $165.67 million. That puts him just behind Alex Ovechkin in career earnings. But Crosby also has multiple ventures off the ice.Beyond the NHL salary and the lucrative performance bonuses, Crosby also has multiple endorsement deals to his name. They have made him a familiar face in his native Canada while also supplementing his on-ice earnings.He signed an important multi-year deal with Adidas in 2015, which kicked off in late 2016 to effectively replace his previous footwear partner, Reebok. The deal is estimated to have brought in anywhere between $1 million and $1.5 million annually over its six-year span till 2021.He also renewed his decade-old deal with Gatorade, which started in 2005 for merely $300,000 CDN, but over the years has expanded to millions per year. He also extended longstanding partnerships with brands like Tim Hortons, CCM, and Bell Canada.Beyond his brand deals, Crosby has ventured into real estate to build continued wealth. This included investing in multiple properties in both Canada and the United States. While none have been reported to have been bought after 2016, Crosby continued to invest in the pieces over the years.However, one of his more recent endorsement deals came when he was named the brand ambassador for Lululemon. Crosby was announced as the face of their campaign for Team Canada/Milano Cortina 2026, but the exact compensation and earnings remain unlisted.In addition, reports also suggested that he has acquired an equity stake in Swiss watchmaker NORQAIN. The exact nature and numbers of the deal are not yet made public, but Crosby remains a shareholder and a business partner.Throughout the 2016-2026 period, Crosby maintained his reputation as one of hockey's most respected figures, known equally for his dominance on the ice and his quiet generosity off it. His approach to wealth management combined smart contract negotiations, selective endorsements, strategic investments, and meaningful philanthropy, creating a financial legacy that extends well beyond his playing career.","Sidney Crosby is one of the highest-paid NHL players of all time.

Tobias Harris, sidelined since December 30 with a left hip sprain, is also likely to return.Isaiah Stewart is listed as available after recovering from an illness.Phoenix has more uncertainty.

NEW DELHI: Against an opponent known for control, variation and an ability to drag matches into uncomfortable territory, Lakshya Sen responded with clarity rather than force. The Indian relied on his court coverage, defensive discipline and smart changes of pace to blunt Kenta Nishimoto’s probing game, gradually turning long rallies into opportunities.The approach paid off as Lakshya edged past the Japanese shuttler in straight games 21-19, 21-11 to move into the men’s singles quarterfinals of the India Open Super 750 at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium here on Thursday.The scoreline did not fully capture the struggle Lakshya endured early in his contest.The Indian was slow to find his rhythm in the opening game. Lakshya trailed 11-16 and then 14-18, with the Japanese appearing in control as the rallies stretched. But the turning point came when Lakshya chose patience over panic. He began engaging Nishimoto in longer exchanges, retrieving relentlessly and forcing his opponent to hit one extra shot each time.Lakshya reeled off five consecutive points, surged ahead and closed out the first game at the first given opportunity. The second game told a different story as the Indian pulled away steadily, sealing the match in 50 minutes.“At the start of the opening game I was struggling with my rhythm a bit and was lifting short and that allowed him to attack more,” Lakshya said.“But then I started lifting the shuttle longer and focused on defending well and I think that turned the first game.” Apart from Lakshya’s victory, the day unfolded as a tale of frustration and heartbreak for Indian badminton fans.Former World Championships silver medallist Kidambi Srikanth went down fighting 21-14, 17-21, 21-17 to France’s 2025 World Tour Finals winner Christo Popov, while HS Prannoy’s resistance ended in a three-game loss to eighth seed Loh Kean Yew of Singapore, 18-21, 21-19, 21-14.India’s challenge in women’s singles also came to an end with Malvika Bansod’s straight-game 18-21, 15-21 loss to Chinese fifth seed Han Yue.Indian hopes took another sharp hit as medal favourites Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty crashed out in a bruising second-round defeat to Japan’s Hiroki Midorikawa and Kyohei Yamashita.

PROBABLE BACKUP PLANS FOR SUNDAR

NEW DELHI: The national selection committee and team management are sweating over Washington Sundar ’s availability for next month’s T20 World Cup after it emerged that a side strain is more serious than first anticipated and will rule the allrounder out of the T20I series against New Zealand starting next week.Sources said that the team management is already preparing backup plans for the initial stages of the tournament. TOI has learnt that the BCCI medical team has suggested that the team management wait for another week to get a proper assessment of Washington’s timeline of recovery. But it is also understood that they been advised to think of a ‘Plan B’ because the recovery period could be cutting it fine.India have other injury worries too. While Tilak Varma is only ruled out of the first three T20Is, the team management has its fingers crossed till he takes the field after having undergone an emergency abdominal surgery last week.“As of now, the selectors and the team management have to think about a backup plan. There is a strong possibility Washington may not be fully fit for the initial stages of the World Cup. A call on his participation in the entire tournament can be discussed after a thorough report by the medical team.Since India mostly play associate nations in the first round of matches, there could be a case for not naming a replacement at all, giving him enough time to recover for the business end of the tournament. One must remember that he is not expected to start in the XI even when he is fit,” a BCCI source said.Washington is supposed to report to the Centre of Excellence (CoE) during the weekend. Sources said the medical team suspects the injury could be more serious than a mere side strain. A thorough assessment will be made of the area around his ribs.Teams are allowed to make changes till seven days before the start of the tournament. India are expected to play with a spin-heavy bowling attack during the T20 World Cup with Varun Chakravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel likely to be the first-choice spinners.Like-forlike option, but waiting for CoE clearance post a shoulder-injury rehab.
