NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Saturday welcomed BCCI's decision to instruct Shah Rukh Khan owned Kolkata Knight Riders to release Bangladesh player Mustafizur Rehman from their roster ahead of Indian Premier League.BJP leader Sangeet Som thanked BCCI for its decision and hailed it as a ""victory of the Hindus of the entire nation.""""Thanks to BCCI for its decision in view of the 100 crore Sanatanis of India,"" Som said.""We said yesterday that cognisance will be taken of this matter because the sentiments of 100 crore people cannot be taken lightly. This is the victory of the Hindus of the entire nation,"" he added.Earlier in the day, BCCI secretary Devjit Saikia said that the decision was taken ""due to the recent development going all across.""""Due to the recent developments which is going on all across, BCCI has instructed the franchise KKR to release one of their player Mustafizur Rahman of Bangladesh from their squad and BCCI has also said that if they ask for any replacement, BCCI is going to allow that replacement,"" Saikia told news agency ANI.Recently, spiritual leaders had launched a broadside against KKR owner Shah Rukh Khan in context of the recent targeting of Hindu minorities in Bangladesh.Devkinandan Thakur criticised Shah Rukh Khan after KKR acquired right-arm pacer Mustafizur for a massive amount of Rs 9.20 crore during the IPL auction.""In Bangladesh, Hindus are being brutally murdered, their homes are being burned, and their sisters and daughters are being raped. After witnessing such brutal killings, how can someone be so heartless, especially someone who calls himself the owner of a team?

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) on Saturday released Bangladeshi fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman from their IPL 2026 squad following a directive from the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ).KKR had picked Mustafizur Rahman for Rs 9.20 crore at the IPL auction held in December. However, his selection triggered a political backlash in India after reports emerged of recent mob violence and lynching incidents involving Hindu minorities in Bangladesh.Following the BCCI’s directive, Mustafizur Rahman will not be part of the IPL 2026 season, and the franchise has been permitted to name a replacement player in accordance with league rules.In a media advisory, KKR said, “Kolkata Knight Riders confirms that BCCI/IPL as the regulator of IPL has instructed it to release Mustafizur Rahman from the squad ahead of the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) season.” The franchise added that the release was carried out after due process and consultations, and that the BCCI would allow a replacement player as per IPL regulations.The controversy drew reactions from political leaders, with Congress MP Shashi Tharoor coming forward in Mustafizur Rahman’s support, while the BJP strongly opposed his selection and targeted KKR co-owner Shah Rukh Khan , calling him a “traitor.”Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said sports should be separated from political tensions. “Cricket should not be made to bear the burden for attacks on minorities in Bangladesh,” he told reporters, adding that Mustafizur Rahman had no role in the violence.“Mustafizur Rahman is a cricketer and has nothing to do with any of these things. He has not been personally accused of any hate speech or condoning or defending any attacks. Mixing these two things is simply not fair,” Tharoor said.He also cautioned against isolating neighbouring countries. “If we become a country that isolates all of our neighbours, and say nobody is playing with any of them, how does it do any good? It is purely a sporting decision, and we should not let politics come into this,” he added.Congress leader and Karnataka Minister Priyank Kharge criticised the BJP for targeting the IPL franchise, saying overseas players participate in the league as per BCCI and IPL rules.In a post on X, Kharge said, “The BJP and their 'Vichar Parivaar' are outraged over the inclusion of a Bangladeshi player in the IPL. If an overseas player is in IPL, it is because BCCI or the IPL rules allow him. Instead of blaming the franchise, shouldn't the BJP leaders ask why BCCI is allowing Bangladesh players to participate in IPL, when they should be banning it.”He further cited past instances to criticise BJP leaders. “The same BJP leaders have no problem when: India played with Pakistan soon after the Pahalgam attack. IPL shifted matches to Islamic countries during COVID. IPL auctions are held in Islamic countries… For BJP, 'nationalism' appears only when it suits their politics,” Kharge added.Congress MP Tariq Anwar defended KKR co-owner Shah Rukh Khan, calling it inappropriate to target the actor. He said foreign players can only be included after due permission from cricketing authorities and under international norms.Reacting to the controversy, Congress leader Supriya Shrinate said the focus should be on who permitted Bangladeshi players to be included in the IPL auction in the first place.Speaking to ANI, she said, ""First of all, I want to ask who put the Bangladeshi players in that pool. This question is for the BCCI and the ICC. Home Minister's son, Jay Shah, should answer who put the Bangladeshi players in the pool where IPL players are bought and sold, the pool where the players' auction takes place... he is the ICC's chief and the main decision-maker in cricket all around the world.""BJP leader Sangeet Som welcomed the BCCI’s decision and launched a sharp attack on Shah Rukh Khan, calling him a “traitor.” He cited repeated violence against religious minorities in Bangladesh and claimed Mustafizur Rahman would not be allowed to play in the IPL.“Despite all this, traitors like Shah Rukh Khan… invest it in players from a country that is working against India,” Som told ANI, adding that the cricketer would not be able to play in the tournament.Uttar Pradesh Minister Narendra Kashyap also praised the BCCI’s move, saying it respected national sentiment. “We welcome the decision of the BCCI that they understood the sentiments of the nation and removed the Bangladeshi player,” he said.Former India cricketer Madan Lal and World Cup winner supported Shah Rukh Khan, saying the actor had no role in team selection.“This is the decision of the BCCI and the Central government must have taken this decision, given the atrocities are being committed against Hindus in Bangladesh,” he told ANI.He added, “There is no fault of Shah Rukh Khan as they have the team who picks the team.”National President of the All India Muslim Jamaat, Maulana Shahabuddin Razvi Barelvi, said there was no act of betrayal in Shah Rukh Khan selecting a Bangladeshi player.Meanwhile, Imam Umer Ahmed Ilyasi of the All India Imam Organisation said Shah Rukh Khan should apologise to the nation over the selection.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Nirupam had urged Shah Rukh Khan to remove the Bangladeshi player, saying it would protect India’s interests and prevent the actor from becoming a target.Hindus in Bangladesh have been victims of mob violence and lynching in the aftermath of protests and the killing of student leader Osman Hadi. On December 18, 2025, Dipu Chandra Das was beaten to death by a mob over alleged blasphemy charges in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district. In another incident, a Hindu youth, Amrit Mondal, was lynched in Rajbari district, triggering protests and strong reactions in India.","Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) released Bangladeshi fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman from their IPL 2026 squad following a directive from the Board of Control for Cricket in India.

The year 2026 is finally here and we know it will not be a routine stop on the electoral calendar. This year's calendar is filled with elections, starting with the long-overdue Mumbai-Pune civic polls. Later, with high-stakes assembly elections due in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry , it will place some of the most influential politicians under rare and sustained scrutiny. For many leaders, the results will define not just the fate of their governments and party, but also their relevance heading into the 2029 Lok Sabha elections.Across these five states and a Union Territory, regional parties are strong and national parties are testing the outer limits of their expansion. What unfolds in 2026 will reshape the party's existence, recalibrate the opposition's cohesion and test the BJP ’s claim of being a truly pan-Indian force. At the centre of it all are a dozen leaders whose careers may pivot decisively over the year.West Bengal remains one of the most politically charged battlegrounds of 2026. The pre-campaign has already started with high-voltage remarks amid the Election Commission's Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise.For Mamata Banerjee, this election comes after a decade in uninterrupted power. Having crushed the Left and successfully repelled the BJP’s surge in the 2021 assembly elections, she now faces her toughest test yet.BJP's momentum stalled in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections after it managed to win only 12 out of 40 seats. In the 2021 assembly election, it won 77 seats while TMC won the election by winning 213 seats.A fourth consecutive term would cement Mamata's status as Bengal’s long-term chief minister and one of the last regional leaders capable of stopping the BJP’s advance. But the margins matter. A slip below 200 seats from the 213 she won in 2021, or a BJP surge past the 100-seat mark, would signal vulnerability and weaken her leverage in national opposition politics ahead of 2029.Meanwhile, on the last day of 2025, Union home minister Amit Shah outlined an action plan for the party's West Bengal unit while reviewing its preparedness for the assembly polls due early next year. Addressing the party's public representatives, both past and present, Shah sought to project a unified front, while indicating former state president Dilip Ghosh as one of the main faces of the saffron camp for the elections.For Ghosh, the stakes are existential. The BJP firebrand and a former TMC heavyweight, he was central to the party’s rise to 77 seats in 2021. If the BJP crosses 120 seats in 2026, Ghosh emerges as Mamata’s undisputed challenger and Bengal’s principal alternative. Failure to capitalise on anti-incumbency, however, would raise uncomfortable questions about his influence and the BJP’s long-term strategy in the state.Tamil Nadu’s contest is shaping up as a three-cornered test of endurance, revival and disruption.Chief minister MK Stalin is seeking a second term after the DMK’s comfortable victory in 2021. Retaining a tally above 130–140 seats would keep the DMK firmly dominant and reinforce Tamil Nadu’s role as a firewall against the BJP’s national narrative. But anti-incumbency pressures, over floods, employment, law and order, and urban governance, could open space for a revival of the opposition.That revival hinges on Edappadi K Palaniswami, the former AIADMK chief minister and leader of the main opposition. A strong showing of 100-plus seats would restore the AIADMK as the DMK’s equal and slow the BJP’s attempt to subsume it. Another weak performance, however, could accelerate AIADMK’s marginalisation and strengthen the BJP’s influence within opposition politics in the state.Hovering over both is Joseph Vijay, the actor-turned-politician whose Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam is eyeing its electoral debut. Even a victory in 10–20 seats could make him a kingmaker. A failure to break through, however, would mean another failed debut and would reinforce the DMK–AIADMK duopoly.In the 2021 assembly election, DMK won 133 seats, AIADMK got 66 seats and BJP got 4 seats.Kerala’s 2026 election carries unusually high stakes for both the Left and the Congress For Pinarayi Vijayan, the CPI(M) stalwart and chief minister, the contest is about legacy. He is aiming for a historic third consecutive term—something rarely achieved in Kerala’s alternating political culture. Retaining a clear majority would keep the LDF dominant in the state and cement Vijayan’s stature as the Left’s most powerful surviving leader. But dipping below the 70-seat mark would likely end his era, especially amid criticism over governance, SFI-linked violence, and fatigue after two terms.On the other side stands VD Satheesan, the Congress-led UDF’s leader of opposition. A crossing of the 80-seat mark would flip the House and revive Congress’s credibility in the South. Another narrow loss, however, would reinforce the perception that while Congress fights hard in Kerala, BJP’s slow creep, not the UDF, is the more consequential long-term challenger.In the 2021 assembly election, the LDF won 99 seats and the UDF got 41 seats, while the NDA was unable to open its tally.Assam will test the durability of strongman politics versus generational transition.Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma is targeting a third straight NDA victory, with ambitious claims of winning over 104 of the state’s 126 seats.In 2021, Sarma delivered a decisive mandate as the BJP-led alliance won 75 seats in the 126-member assembly.Success would burnish his national ambitions and strengthen his standing as the BJP’s most assertive regional leader. But even a significant drop from the BJP’s 60 seats in 2021 would expose cracks beneath his muscular governance style, particularly amid CAA and NRC.Facing him is Gaurav Gogoi, Congress leader and son of former CM Tarun Gogoi. For Gogoi, 2026 is about emergence. A credible fight, around 40 seats for the INDIA bloc, would position him as Assam’s foremost Congress face and a potential future chief minister. A rout would risk pushing the Congress further into irrelevance in the state.Small in size but large in symbolism, Puducherry could deliver one of 2026’s most telling verdicts.Incumbent CM N Rangasamy is leading a fragile AINRC-BJP coalition and currently governing with a narrow majority secured in 2021. Retaining power would validate his long-standing role as a political kingmaker and reinforce the BJP’s power of managing complex coalition politics.For V Vaithilingam, the Congress stalwart, 2026 is a chance at revival. A UDF victory with 15 or more seats would mark a dramatic comeback for a party that once ruled Puducherry. Failure would further cement the BJP’s foothold and underline Congress’s shrinking influence in smaller southern units.Beyond state leaders, two national figures will shape the outcomes across all five battlegrounds.For, 2026 is less about immediate electoral survival and more about narrative control. With high-stakes assembly elections this year, the Prime Minister’s role will be that of a campaign anchor and message-setter across multiple states, particularly West Bengal, Assam and the southern battlegrounds where the BJP remains an outsider.A strong BJP showing in Bengal or incremental gains in Tamil Nadu and Kerala would reinforce PM Modi’s claim of leading a truly pan-Indian party heading into 2029. Conversely, stagnation or reverses in these regions would embolden the opposition’s argument that the BJP’s expansion has peaked outside its core Hindi belt. The margins, not just victories, will matter in shaping how invincible PM Modi appears in the run-up to his third Lok Sabha contest.While not a mass leader,will be one of the BJP’s most closely watched backroom strategists in 2026. As a key organisational figure tasked with strengthening party units beyond the Hindi heartland, the outcomes in West Bengal, Assam and the South will directly reflect on his effectiveness.If the BJP improves booth-level performance, vote share and cadre depth in traditionally resistant states, Nabin’s stature within the party will rise sharply. But failure to translate central leadership popularity into durable state-level structures would revive internal questions about the BJP’s organisational limits and succession planning within its second rung of leadership.For, 2026 is the culmination of ""Mission 2026"". As Union home minister and the BJP’s chief electoral architect, he is overseeing campaigns across Assam, Puducherry, Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Clean sweeps in states the BJP already governs, combined with breakthroughs in the South, would further solidify his authority.For, 2026 is a make-or-break year. After setbacks in Bihar and Delhi, strong UDF performances in Kerala or Puducherry, or credible INDIA bloc gains elsewhere, would validate his approach to coalition politics. Continued erosion would deepen doubts about his leadership at a time when Congress’s room for error is shrinking fast.For, this year will decide if she is ready to take charge of the party, as demanded by several disgruntled party leaders in the past. As Congress’s most recognisable campaigner after Rahul Gandhi, her effectiveness will be judged by how far she can convert charisma and street connect into electoral dividends, particularly in states where the party is fighting to arrest decline rather than expand.Strong UDF performances in Kerala or a credible revival in smaller battlegrounds would bolster her standing as the party's chief mobiliser.Meanwhile, in BMC elections, the Pawar senior and junior have united for the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and thehave joined hands for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls. If these reunions frutify, it could change the dynamics of mega Maharashtra alliances (MVA and Mahayuti).In 2026, people will look atwith the 'will he, won't he' question. With his constant tug of war with his own party, it will be interesting to see if Congress finally makes him fall in line with the party lines or if he calls it quits. Tharoor’s influence will also be tested by outcomes closer to home in Kerala.A Congress-led UDF victory would strengthen Tharoor’s hand within the party, renewing speculation about a larger leadership role nationally or in the state. A loss, however, would blunt his political momentum. How Tharoor positions himself during the campaign, whether as a team player or a distinct voice, will be closely parsed by both supporters and critics.Stage is all for a year of back-to-back elections that matter. In the end, 2026 will not just choose governments, it will quietly decide who still matters when the long road to 2029 truly begins.","This year's calendar is filled with elections, starting with the long-overdue Mumbai-Pune civic polls.

Mamdani On ‘Warpath’, Undos Former NYC Mayor’s Orders | Eric Adams Gets Booed At Inauguration

A subway station is an unlikely venue for a mayoral oath — and Punjabi pop an even more unlikely soundtrack. But when New York mayor Zohran Mamdani danced to the track ‘Gaddi Red Challenger’ by Toronto-based artist Babbu aka Babbulicious at his inauguration, American politics met bhangra beats in a moment that instantly went viral.With Mamdani, his wife Rama Duwaji and hundreds in attendance joining in, the ceremony turned into an unexpected celebration of diasporic culture. For Babbulicious — the turbaned Sikh singer, who is also a comedian and designer, it was a powerful moment of visibility. “Zohran sang along, and the sight of (US senator) Bernie Sanders clapping and vibing to a Punjabi song was surreal,” he told TOI over email.Born Babbu Singh and raised in Toronto’s Brampton Punjabi belt, Babbulicious’s creative journey has been anything but conventional. He dropped out of art college at 19 and went on to build a career that spans influencer skits, visual art, puppet series, children’s books and charting music.“All my art, in one way or another, is about connecting with my younger self — creating things that would have made me feel seen, valued,” he says.Mamdani’s team discovered ‘Gaddi Red Challenger’ through social media. Singh later adapted lyrics to “New York vich munda renda”, reflecting the mayor’s multicultural identity.The celebratory moment also drew predictable backlash. Far-right voices criticised the use of non-Western music at a civic ceremony and misidentified the turbaned artist’s religion. Singh remains unfazed. “Sometimes it’s best not to engage. It’s hard to convince someone to change their bias, so the best thing is to smile and continue with your day,” he says.Much of Singh’s work deliberately challenges stereotypes around Sikh identity, often through humour, including his popular ‘Khalsa Uncle’ skits. Representation, he believes, is essential. He recalls the impact of seeing Indian American designer and actor Waris Ahluwalia in Wes Anderson films while growing up. “Seeing someone who looked like me meant everything. Funny enough, he was at the inauguration — we met for the first time, and I hugged him and told him how much that visibility mattered. It made me feel like we could be anything we wanted to be.”While rappers like Lil Wayne and Jay-Z have shaped his musical sensibility, Singh says artists who push creative boundaries while staying true to themselves resonate most deeply. “Outkast, the Beatles, Daft Punk, Ye have had a meaningful impact on me.”Today, Toronto’s diasporic energy is propelling Punjabi pop onto the global stage. Reflecting this shift, Toronto Metropolitan University is set to launch a course on Diljit Dosanjh this year, examining his influence on music, identity and the Punjabi diaspora. For Singh, his subway-station bhangra moment signals a wider cultural shift. “Punjabi music is ready for the mainstream,” he says.This story had continued from a page 1 story in the newspaper.

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat HC has paved the way for a couple’s divorce after their marriage broke down over conflicting desires about where to live — the husband preferred living in the UK, but the wife did not want to leave India.The HC quashed Ahmedabad’s family court order that had rejected a mutual-consent divorce petition as “premature”.The family court had also cited the absence of a waiver application to bypass the mandatory six-month “cooling-off” period under Section 13B (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The HC restored the divorce petition and directed the family court to decide the matter within six months.The couple married on Dec 9, 2023, but separated barely a month later, on Jan 17, 2024, when the man left for the UK for further studies. He informed her that he planned to settle permanently in the UK and asked her to join him. However, the woman was reluctant to leave India. She informed him she was settled in Ahmedabad and preferred to pursue her career in India only.After deciding to part ways, they filed a divorce petition under Section 13B of the Act on April 1, 2025, and stated that the discord between them arose from their desire to live in different countries.After the hearing, the bench of Justice Sangeeta Vishen and Justice Nisha Thakore said, “Perceptibly, there is no scope of reunion between the parties, for the parties are staying separately for more than one year as on the date of presenting the petition under Section 13B of the Act of 1955. Both the parties have mutually agreed to divorce; therefore, the six-month period as well as one year as provided in Section 13B (1) is almost over.

14 Maoists killed in Bastar as wipeout target looms

RAIPUR: One-and-a-half months after top Maoist gun Madvi Hidma was felled in an encounter in Andhra Pradesh, his confidant Barse Deva surrendered along with 40-odd rebels in neighbouring Telangana on Saturday, a development security officials described as the wipeout of PLGA battalion number 1, the most feared Maoist strike unit in Bastar.Deva and Hidma were not just comrades-in-arms; they were friends and contemporaries from the same village — Puvarti in Sukma district.Days before Hidma was killed on Nov 18 last year, Chhattisgarh deputy CM Vijay Sharma, who also holds the home portfolio, had travelled to Puvarti and met the mothers of both Deva and Hidma in their village.Both women, who had seen their sons’ names become synonymous with ambushes and gun battles, had publicly appealed to them to shun violence and join the mainstream. But within a few days, Hidma got killed and attention turned squarely to Deva.“Barse Deva along with his cadres had fled to neighbouring Telangana from Chhattisgarh,” Sharma told reporters in Raipur. “We were also in talks for their surrender here, but they decided to lay down arms in Telangana, which is also a good thing.”Puvarti had spent nearly four decades under Maoist dominance until a security camp was finally set up there in February 2024.Influenced by Hidma, Deva joined the Maoist ranks in 2003. Since then, the two, both from Koya tribal community, remained the inseparable comrades-in-arms.By the time of his surrender, Deva carried a cumulative reward of Rs 75 lakh, announced by Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and the NIA. As per his history sheet, he was involved in multiple ambushes where CRPF personnel were killed, and “several ambushes/raids like Jhiram Ghati, in which Mahendra Karma, a former minister, and other Congress figures, including Vidya Charan Shukla, were killed.”Officials say that Deva and Hidma together planned some of the most devastating attacks in the region, including: Darbha Ghati attack on May 25, 2013, which left 27 people dead, among them 10 security personnel, and April 2021 Sukma–Bijapur ambush, in which 22 security personnel were killed.Security forces killed at least 14 Maoists on Saturday in two clashes in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar region, opening the first offensive of the year against Left-Wing extremism.The encounters in Sukma and Bijapur comes with the clock ticking on Centre’s March 31, 2026 deadline to end the insurgency nationwide, reports Rashmi Drolia.For forces, the biggest challenge over the next three months is to clear South Bastar of Maoists, their last stronghold. The Saturday encounters coincided with the surrender in Telangana of Barse Deva, one of Chhattisgarh’s most wanted Maoist commanders.","Security forces killed at least 14 Maoists on Saturday in two clashes in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar region, opening the first offensive of the year against Left-Wing extremism.

BJP Leader Attacks Shah Rukh Khan Over KKR's Bangladeshi Cricketer Amid Hindu Lynching in Bangladesh

.

NEW DELHI: Hindu religious leaders and BJP figures have launched sharp attacks on Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan over his IPL team Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) selecting Bangladeshi cricketer Mustafizur Rahman , while the Congress has stepped in to defend the actor, calling the remarks against him an attack on India’s pluralism.The first public criticism came from Hindu spiritual leader Devkinandan Thakur, who questioned KKR’s decision in the backdrop of reported violence against Hindu minorities in Bangladesh. Speaking to ANI, Thakur said the KKR management should remove the Bangladeshi player. He demanded that the money paid to the cricketer be given to families of Hindu victims as an apology.""The management of KKR, their boss, should remove that cricketer (Mustafizur Rahman). Rs 9.2 crore that they are giving to that cricketer, that money should be given as an apology to the relatives of the Hindu children if they are in India, so that at least they can know that their feelings are with the Hindus,"" Thakur said.Spiritual leader Jagadguru Swami Rambhadracharya went on to questioned Khan’s character and called hhim a traitor.""He (Shah Rukh Khan) is not a hero. Shah Rukh Khan does not have a character.His actions have been those of a traitor,"" Rambhadracharya said.Soon after, BJP leader Sangeet Som called Shah Rukh Khan a “traitor” and accused him of investing money in a player from a country he claimed was “working against India”. Som said Mustafizur Rahman would not be allowed to play in the IPL.""The way Hindus are being persecuted in Bangladesh, women and girls are being raped, their homes are being burned, and anti-India slogans are being chanted there. Despite all this, traitors like Shah Rukh Khan, I'm calling him a traitor because everything he has is given by India, given by the people of India, but where do they invest this money? They invest it in players from a country that is working against India. I want to tell people like Shah Rukh Khan that they will not succeed. At any cost, they will not be able to get Mustafizur Rahman to play here. Rahman won't be able to step outside the airport,"" Som told ANI.The response from Congress followed soon after. MP Manickam Tagore condemned the remarks against Khan, calling them an attack on India’s pluralism. In a post on X, Tagore said hatred could not define nationalism and criticised the RSS for spreading division.""Calling Superstar Shah Rukh Khan a 'traitor' is an attack on India's pluralism. Hate cannot define nationalism. RSS must stop poisoning society.""The attacks come amid a series of violent incidents targeting members of the Hindu community in Bangladesh. Last month, two Hindu youths were lynched in separate incidents. Dipu Chandra Das, a garment factory worker in Mymensingh district, was beaten to death over alleged blasphemy charges on December 18, after which his body was reportedly hanged and set on fire.",Hindu religious leaders and BJP figures have launched sharp attacks on Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan over his IPL team Kolkata Knight Riders.

Denise DeBartolo York’s family net worth hit $8.4B on the 2025 Forbes 400

The San Francisco 49ers and Leeds United explain the York family’s money trail





Denise DeBartolo York and her family landed at No. 163 on the 2025 Forbes 400, with Forbes estimating their net worth at $8.4 billion. That figure comes from Forbes’ latest ranking, as reported Sept. 19, 2025.This is not some mystery-money story. Forbes ties the York family fortune primarily to their ownership of the San Francisco 49ers, where the family holds more than 90% of the franchise.The Forbes 400 list is basically a “you’re in or you’re out” snapshot of America’s richest. In 2025, Forbes said the 400 wealthiest Americans held $6.6 trillion combined, and you needed at least $3.8 billion to make the cut.The York family cleared that bar easily. WFMJ’s report notes the family’s wealth has climbed hard over the last decade, tracking Forbes wealth history data: $1.9 billion in 2016, $3.2 billion by 2020, and then the 2025 Forbes 400 estimate at $8.4 billion.They also landed ahead of other famous names on that same 2025 list, including Mark Cuban and Steven Spielberg, per the same report.Here’s the straight line: Edward DeBartolo Sr. bought the San Francisco 49ers for $13 million in 1977, and the family still controls the franchise today.Denise DeBartolo York took control of the 49ers in 2000. Her oldest son, Jed York, is now the team’s CEO. Forbes also lists the 49ers as the NFL’s sixth-most valuable franchise, and the team finished as the Super Bowl runner-up in 2023.Then the family pushed further into global soccer. The 49ers’ ownership arm agreed to buy the remaining 56% stake in Leeds United in 2023 after already owning 44%.The WFMJ report said the family paid more than $200 million to acquire that remaining stake.Bottom line: the Yorks aren’t climbing because of a random side hustle. Their net worth rises when their sports assets rise. And the biggest one is still the 49ers.Denise DeBartolo York and her family landed at No. 163 on the latest Forbes 400, with an estimated net worth of $8.4 billion, driven largely by their majority ownership of the San Francisco 49ers, which Forbes ranks as the National Football League’s sixth most valuable franchise. York, who took control of the team in 2000, now sees her son Jed York serving as CEO, while the family has also expanded into global soccer with their takeover of Leeds United in 2023.Their ranking places them ahead of billionaires like Mark Cuban, Stephen Spielberg, and Donald Trump, underscoring how central sports ownership has been to the York family’s growing financial power.","Denise DeBartolo York and her family landed at No. 163 on the 2025 Forbes 400, with Forbes estimating their net worth at $8.4 billion.

Patrick Mahomes welcomes 2026 focused on rehab as Chiefs shift from urgency to patience





The Kansas City Chiefs are closing out a season few in the locker room expected, and the unease has little to do with the standings. For the first time in years, the focus in Kansas City has shifted away from playoff math and toward patience. At the center of it all is Patrick Mahomes, whose recovery has quietly become the franchise’s most important storyline heading into 2026.While Andy Reid addressed the situation publicly, it was Brittany Mahomes who offered the most telling glimpse. A New Year’s Instagram post showed a joyful family moment, fireworks overhead, children close by. Yet one detail stood out. Patrick Mahomes was still on crutches, his knee wrapped in a heavy brace. The image said more than any official update. Rehab remains the priority, and the process is far from over.Patrick Mahomes suffered ACL and LCL tears late in Week 15 against the Chargers while pushing to keep the season alive. That single play reshaped the Chiefs’ winter. The expectation inside the organization is cautious optimism, with a hopeful return near Week 1. Until then, progress is measured in small, deliberate steps, not timelines.Reid confirmed Mahomes has stayed deeply involved, even if he will not travel with the team for the Week 18 finale. As the coach explained, “He’s around, so he’s in the building and working and doing his rehab, and spending a lot of hours doing it.” Reid added, “He’s really attacked that and will continue to do that. He’s around and sees the guys, but most of his time is being spent rehabbing.”Asked about Mahomes joining the team on the road, Reid shut that down quickly. “Probably not this soon, no,” he said.The decision reflects caution, not concern. Knee injuries demand discipline, and the Chiefs see no value in unnecessary strain. Rehab will stretch through the offseason, likely into training camp, with careful checkpoints along the way.For now, Mahomes enters 2026 grounded, surrounded by family, focused on recovery. The season may be ending, but belief in Kansas City remains firmly intact.Also Read: “Hate will not get us out”: Brittany Mahomes addresses hate and healing during emotionally charged moment off the field","Patrick Mahomes is entering 2026 focused entirely on rehab after suffering ACL and LCL tears late in the season.

Natalya Neidhart’s WWE career and earnings growth

Tyson Kidd’s in-ring success and post-injury WWE role





Natalya Neidhart and Tyson Kidd were born into professional wrestling and WWE universe and have been established since they were 20 years old. Through WWE contracts, television showcases, and decades of steady employment instead of fleeting headlines, both built financial futures. Good record of relevancy, including expanding their combined net worth.Neither is among WWE's top 10 global superstars so far as compensation, at least on the finer points of the evening, but the dollars tell the tale of consistent success for each. Natalya is still appearing regularly, while Tyson Kidd moved into an important backstage position after suffering a career-ending injury. Combined, their earnings have been accumulated with salaries, achievement bonuses, merchandise royalties, and offstage duties not associated with actual wrestling.Natalya Neidhart has had one of the longest, uninterrupted runs in WWE's modern era women's division. Having first debuted on the main roster in the late 2000s, she quickly became a consistent presence on weekly television, premium live events, and overseas excursions. This consistency eventually progressed into an uptick in contract renewals and a small bump in pay every year.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.The bulk of Natalya's income has traditionally come from a salary she is guaranteed to earn annually, bonuses related to major events, merchandise, and further exposure via WWE-related media. The association with the iconic Hart wrestling family only enhanced her brand value, allowing her to remain relevant throughout almost every era of women's wrestling. Her individual net worth has widely been estimated at around $2 million, a figure based on years of reliable earnings, not temporary highs.Tyson Kidd’s real-life identity is TJ Wilson. He started his career working as an in-ring performer, predominantly as a skilled singles male and tag team wrestler. However, a serious neck injury in 2015 saw his career take a drastic turn when he was forced to stop competing full-time.Instead of releasing him, WWE kept Kidd backstage in a producer and trainer role. It's a role that hardly anyone but hardcore fans will notice, but guarantees employment, stability, and permanence in a company. His continued role in planning matches and developing talent has helped him secure an ongoing source of income, which is reported at $3 million.Combined, Natalya Neidhart and husband Tyson Kidd have a net worth estimated at $5 million. That number represents two decades' worth of WWE contracts, bonuses, royalties, and near-constant employment. Their financial profile is linked to longevity, faith from management, and shifting roles within WWE, the opposite of top-tier superstars, most of whom work based on huge short-term contracts.

Why are Vancouver Canucks and Boston Bruins emerging as trade market storylines?



Bruins URGED to make HUGE trade... Report reveals NEXT move | Boston Bruins News





The NHL rumor roundup is getting hotter as the speculation around Vancouver Canucks trades involving Kiefer Sherwood and Elias Pettersson heats up, while the Boston Bruins are rumored to be inquiring about Matias Maccelli ahead of the March 6 trade day. With several clubs looking into the market from the start, these unfolding plots are rapidly capturing the attention of all the people around the league.It has been reported that both sides are quietly investigating the possibilities, and this information comes from Sportsnet, The Athletic, and The Province sources. A lot of names are thrown around, and the management is set to acquire the best ones. The rumor mill is very busy as the deadline is approaching.The Canucks' trade of Quinn Hughes to the Minnesota Wild not only surprised the league but also hinted that more such changes could be in the offing. Vancouver’s Elliotte Friedman of Sportsnet has Kiefer Sherwood, the winger, as the potential trade candidate from the Canucks, while he also mentioned on The Fan Hockey Show that the San Jose Sharks might be interested in him. Vancouver seems to be receptive to the idea of trading off some of its players before the deadline, as there are multiple teams making calls.Harman Dayal of The Athletic mentioned that the Canucks have to act quickly on impending UFAs if they are to control their freewheeling forward group. This could lead to the trading of either Sherwood or Evander Kane.At the same time, Patrick Johnston from The Province reported that there are still talks regarding Elias Pettersson, notwithstanding his poor performance and $11.6 million cap hit. On the other hand, the Bruins are reportedly interested in Matias Maccelli, as per Fluto Shinzawa of The Athletic, who sees him as a potential offensive boost for Boston; however, NESN’s Victor Barbosa has warned that a trade with Toronto could be complicated due to the rivalry between the two teams.The Vancouver Canucks and Boston Bruins are still the teams to monitor with the approaching trade deadline. The unfolding of these rumors into trades will be determined by several factors: timing, price, and playoff aspirations—but the talk around the league indicates that changes are to happen shortly. Trade discussions remain fluid as deadline pressure builds.Also Read: Top NHL suspensions and fines of 2025: Mathew Barzal, Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, and others disciplined",The NHL rumor roundup is getting hotter as the speculation around Vancouver Canucks trades involving Kiefer Sherwood and Elias Pettersson heats up.

Caitlin Clark is a huge Drake Maye fan



Caitlin Clark’s most-awaited recovery and return







With the Super Bowl almost a month away, everyone has their favorites, and so does WNBA’s biggest star, Caitlin Clark. On the recent episode of the “New Heights” podcast hosted by the Kelce brothers, Jason and Travis, the 2024 ROTY winner appeared and sparked a cross-sport debate after naming her favorites for Super Bowl 2026.Though Clark hails from Iowa, she admitted her admiration for the New England Patriots, which is largely influenced by her liking for Patriots star QB Drake Maye. This seemed like a classic case where greatness recognizes and appreciates greatness.The last episode of New Heights for 2025 was anything but not dramatic. In a conversation with Jason and Travis over who is Clark’s favorite to win the next Super Bowl, Caitlin revealed, “I may not be cheering for anybody…but honestly, I am a Drake Maye fan. He’s been incredible.Continuing, she said, “I will probably be pulling for the Patriots, but the Rams are really good too. Sam Darnold seems like a good guy…I could root for him.”Drake Maye and Caitlin Clark began their professional career in 2024 and have been proving to be a cornerstone for their teams. Draye Maye registered a completion rate of 66.6% completing 225-of-338 passes in 2024, over 2,276 yards, and 15 touchdowns.Clark also entered the 2025 season after a historic rookie campaign where she averaged 19.2 points and a league-leading 8.4 assists per game. Though her 2025 season ended early, just after 13 games, due to an injury, the snippets from the USA camp show Clark is healthier and ready to enter the 2026 season with a bang.While the Super Bowl occupies the current headline from who’ll play to who’ll perform at halftime, the Indy fever fans are more concerned with Clark’s physical longevity. Reports suggest her 100% recovery and her focus on strength training to return by the WNBA’s 2026 tip-off. Clark’s return is just not crucial for the Fever, whose offensive strength revolves around her, but also for the league as she’s a walking viewership magnet.In 2025, as per ESPN, across all the 24 post-season games, WNBA delivered its best ever viewership ratings with an average of 1.2 million viewers. The four-most-watched WNBA games of 2025 all featured Caitlin Clark and her team.

Peyton Manning's endorsement deals





Peyton Manning never relied only on arm strength to define his career. From the moment he entered the NFL in 1998, his sharp football mind and calm leadership style made him stand out. He did not just win games. He changed how the quarterback position was played and how stars could build value beyond the field.It's been years since HOF hung up his cleats, but his financial success still shows his football career.

From late-round draft pick to one of the Jaguars’ most trusted linemen





The Jacksonville Jaguars’ rise to a 12-4 record was a steady buildup, and one player who has embodied and anchored the team’s performance and stability is offensive guard Cole Van Lanen. Van Lanen’s NFL journey began without much fanfare, and it began when he was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the sixth round of the 2021 NFL Draft.His rookie contract reflected that status, a four-year deal worth $3.6 million with limited guaranteed money. He appeared in just one season for Green Bay, earning roughly $248,000, before his career took a new direction. When the Jaguars brought him in during 2022, they assumed a modest portion of his rookie contract.In the 2025 season alone, he played 15 games, logging 576 offensive snaps and remaining active in special teams situations. That reliability became a valuable asset for a team pushing toward contention. With his contract set to expire, Jacksonville avoided the risk of free agency by agreeing to a three-year, $51 million extension.According to NFL insider Ian Rapoport, the deal includes $32.5 million in guaranteed compensation and incentives that could increase the total value to $55.5 million.Negotiated by CAA Football’s RJ Gonser and Jim Denton, it represents the largest contract of Van Lanen’s career.After five NFL seasons, his net worth stood at $3.23 million (according to Salary Sport) entering 2026. That figure is expected to increase by at least $10 million almost immediately once the extension takes effect. His average annual salary will now sit at $17 million, with early seasons likely carrying higher payouts.By the end of the deal, Van Lanen’s career earnings could reach $57.5 million, or close to $62 million if incentives are met. As of Week 18, the Jaguars are set to face off against the Tennessee Titans on Sunday, January 4, 2026.Also read: Who is Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan?

Riley Gaines backs state laws and supports female athletes speaking out







Riley Gaines has once again stepped into the national spotlight. The former collegiate swimmer announced that she plans to attend two major Supreme Court hearings that could shape the future of women’s sports in the United States. The cases focus on whether states can legally restrict transgender athletes from competing in women’s categories.Gaines said the upcoming decisions are extremely important. She believes the rulings will determine whether laws designed to protect women’s sports are constitutional. The hearings involve laws from West Virginia and Idaho. Both cases have drawn national attention and sparked strong opinions on fairness, safety, and equal opportunity in sports.Riley Gaines confirmed she will be present at the Supreme Court in two weeks for the hearings of West Virginia v. B.P.J. and Little v. Hecox. She explained that these cases will decide if states are allowed to protect women’s sports under the Constitution. Gaines also encouraged her supporters to make their voices heard by signing a related petition.The West Virginia case centers on a state law that prevents transgender girls from competing in female sports categories.A middle school athlete named Becky challenged the law, arguing that it violates constitutional rights and Title IX protections. Becky has reportedly been on medication since the start of puberty. Gaines believes the case will have a major impact on youth and school sports nationwide.The second case, Little v. Hecox, involves Idaho’s HB 500 law. This law banned transgender athletes from women’s sports. Lindsay, a transgender college student at Boise State University, was affected by the rule and challenged it in court. The Supreme Court agreed to review both cases.In addition to her legal advocacy, Gaines recently voiced strong support for San Jose State University volleyball player Brooke Slusser. In a Fox News interview, Slusser shared the emotional stress she faced after learning a transgender athlete, Blaire Flemming, was competing on her team. Gaines accused the school of failing to inform female athletes about the situation.Gaines said Slusser only spoke up after realizing she had been living with and sharing hotel rooms with a biological male during team trips. She added that Slusser eventually left school and returned home due to concerns for her safety and mental health. Gaines described the situation as abusive.Slusser later revealed that the experience deeply affected her health. She said the stress led to an eating disorder and caused her to temporarily lose her menstrual cycle. Gaines continues to argue that these stories highlight why women’s voices must be central in discussions about sports policies.Also Read: Riley Gaines slams doctors over “non-standard” gender surgeries, demands strict action",Riley Gaines will attend two Supreme Court hearings that could shape the future of women's sports in the United States.

Once Deja Nicole Hiott entered the picture, the internet did not. (Image via Getty)

Deja Nicole Hiott has a life online, and she started letting fans see him in it

Ja’Marr Chase and Deja Nicole Hiott have kept it mostly private, but the timeline still got out

Ja’Marr Chase has a son, and old legal drama still follows his name online





Who is Ja’Marr Chase’s girlfriend? That question got a real name in mid-2025, after a months-long guessing game around the Cincinnati Bengals star wide receiver’s off-field life. Reports from People and Parade linked Chase to influencer Deja Nicole Hiott (also listed as Deja Nicole Hiott Johnson), who started posting couple photos and clips that made the “soft launch” feel pretty loud.This interest is not random. Chase is one of the faces of the Bengals and, as of March 2025, he also became the NFL’s highest-paid wide receiver after agreeing to a four-year, $161 Million extension that averages $40.25 Million per year. Big money always brings bigger attention, even when the player stays quiet.Multiple outlets describe Deja Nicole Hiott as an influencer and pilates instructor who has shared photos and videos with Chase on TikTok, including mirror selfies and travel posts. People reported she has supported him at Bengals games and that the two have been publicly linked since early 2025.Hiott has also been described as an entrepreneur. People reported she co-founded a skincare brand called DN Skin with her sister in 2020 and has worked with brands as an influencer.A separate July 2025 write-up from Where Is The Buzz leaned into the “viral moment” angle after one TikTok photo dump sparked heavy reaction online. That outlet’s tone is tabloidy, but it is part of why the couple trended outside football circles.Chase and Hiott have not done a formal “yes, we are together” interview. That said, both People and Parade point to social posts in 2025 that made the relationship public-facing, with Parade noting the couple went “IG official” in June 2025.There is also some fan-sleuthing in the mix.

TMZ reported a judge granted Chase a temporary restraining order in August 2023.One reason this story keeps resurfacing is that it lives in screenshots and reposts, even when the football conversation has moved on.","Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase has been linked to Deja Nicole Hiott since 2025.

The New York Rangers couldn't have picked a better time to put together their most complete performance of the season. Mika Zibanejad led the way with a historic night in Friday's Winter Classic, recording five points, including the first hat trick in the event's history, as New York defeated the Florida Panthers 5-1.Zibanejad's five-point performance set an NHL record for outdoor games and sparked a Rangers team that desperately needed something to go right. New York entered the game losers of three straight and missing multiple key players to injury, but found a way to dominate the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions.The sellout crowd of 36,153 at loanDepot park witnessed the Rangers firing on all cylinders. Artemi Panarin added two goals and an assist for a three-point night that gives him seven points in NHL outdoor games, tied for the most all-time. Alexis Lafreniere contributed three assists, matching the outdoor game record.The Rangers talked about treating this game as a fresh start after a difficult stretch. Zibanejad explained that the team spent a couple of days with families and friends before refocusing for game time, and the approach clearly worked.""We talked about it, about a fresh start here,"" Zibanejad said after the game. He expressed hope that the performance could be the beginning of something good for the struggling Rangers.Coach Mike Sullivan praised his team's effort across the board. The power play went 2-for-3 with Panarin scoring his first power-play goal of the season. The penalty kill was excellent at 5-for-6, shutting down Florida's dangerous attack at critical moments. Igor Shesterkin made 36 saves to keep the defending champions at bay.Sullivan noted that having top players show up on the scoresheet puts the team in a better position to win, but emphasized it was more than just offensive production. He thought the Rangers' best players were their very best on both sides of the puck.The challenge now becomes turning one excellent performance into sustained success. The Rangers improved to 20-18-5 but remain just 5-10-3 at home, where they've been shut out six times and outscored 57-34.New York gets its next chance Monday when they host Utah at Madison Square Garden. The team is still missing captain J.T. Miller, who sat out his sixth straight game with an upper-body injury, though he's skating with the team again and nearing a return.Zibanejad acknowledged the team needs to keep building on the foundation laid in Miami. The blocked shots, defensive sacrifice, and timely saves from Shesterkin provided a blueprint for success that needs to become the standard rather than the exception.","New York Rangers defeated Florida Panthers 5-1 in the Winter Classic.

LeBron James vs Stephen Curry salary breakdown

The net worth battle between LeBron James and Stephen Curry







LeBron James and Stephen Curry are the Mount Rushmore of modern NBA. They just do not dominate the court with their skills and game IQ, but make a significant impact off the court too. It is still wild to imagine how they both were born in the same hospital. Shocked much? As reported by the Beacon Journal in 2015, both James (1984) and Curry (1988) were born at Akron General Medical Center in Ohio, just a few years apart.These two heavyweights just don’t outshine their opponents on the court, but they also command the financial landscape of NBA. From battling for rings to sharing a bond of trust and respect, LeBron James and Stephen Curry have come a long way and so did their bank accounts. One is a certified billionaire business mogul, while the other is currently the highest-paid on-court performer the league has ever seen.If one just looks at the seasonal paycheck, then Stephen Curry is actually winning. For the 2025–26 season, Steph is pulling in a staggering $59.6 million from the Golden State Warriors, making him the highest-paid player in the league, a record that he has held since 2017-18. But LeBron James isn't exactly lagging, despite his Lakers salary for this season sitting at $52.6 million.The difference is Curry’s art of the ""Supermax."" He was the first player to cross the $200 million contract threshold when he signed a 5-year $201 million deal with the Warriors in 2017. And with his recent veteran extension of $62 million for 1-year, Curry’s on his way to becoming the first NBA player to be paid $62 million for a single season in 2026-27. However, while Steph wins the annual salary race, LeBron still leads in total career on-court earnings, having banked over $580 million since he was drafted back in 2003.This is where the comparison gets steep and the difference wide. LeBron James officially hit billionaire status in 2022 and currently sits at a net worth of approximately $1.3 billion. He didn't get there just by playing ball; he built an empire. Between his lifetime Nike deal (rumored to be worth over $1 billion), his production company SpringHill, and stakes in Fenway Sports Group (which owns the Red Sox and Liverpool FC), LeBron is playing a completely different game off the court.Stephen Curry’s current net worth is estimated at $240 million as of late 2025. While that’s a massive fortune, it shows the difference between being a superstar and being a tycoon. Steph’s wealth is climbing fast, though, thanks to his own Curry Brand, which is now independent after breaking with Under Armour and his Unanimous Media production house. At the end of the day, whether you prefer the King’s power or the Chef’s range, both are proving that the modern athlete is just as much a CEO as they are a point guard.Also read: ""“We emptied the cups”: LeBron James and Bronny James get candid on LA Lakers’ Spill The Tea","LeBron James and Stephen Curry are the Mount Rushmore of modern NBA.

How the game changes without Jokic





when the Denver Nuggets face the Cleveland Cavaliers on January 2, 2026. Denver has ruled out its starting center as he continues to recover from a left knee hyperextension, an injury the team expects will keep him out for at least four weeks.This game was expected to be one of the more notable matchups of the week. Instead, it arrives with Denver missing much of its regular rotation and focused on getting through the night without further issues. The Nuggets are deep into an Eastern Conference road trip and are clearly thinking beyond a single January game.The Denver Nuggets confirmed earlier in the day that Nikola Jokic will not suit up in Cleveland. His absence is part of a planned recovery process, not a late decision or short-term rest.The game tips off at 7:30 p.m. ET at Rocket Arena, which means fans in India will be watching early on January 3. There has been no indication from the team that a return was ever on the table for this matchup.Nikola Jokic suffered a hyperextension of his left knee earlier in the week, with additional concern around a bone bruise. Denver has already outlined a recovery window of more than four weeks, with a re-evaluation expected in about a month.Before the injury, he was averaging 29.6 points, 12.2 rebounds, and 11 assists per game. His absence has already affected Denver’s short-term outlook and could play a role in how the MVP race unfolds this season.Jokic is only one of several Nuggets unavailable tonight. Denver’s injury report is one of the longest it has carried all season, especially in the frontcourt.Jamal Murray is listed with an ankle sprain but is expected to play, which would leave him as the clear focal point of Denver’s offense.Without Jokic, Denver Nuggets loses its main scorer, rebounder, and playmaker. The offense becomes more guard-driven, with fewer easy looks created through the center position.Also read: Denver Nuggets vs Cleveland Cavaliers regular season game: Full injury report, who's out, where to watch, and more (January 2, 2025) Cleveland enters with a healthier lineup and a clear advantage inside.

Russell Westbrook surpasses Oscar Robertson



Russell Westbrook’s longevity







On January 2, 2026, Russell Westbrook didn’t just break a record but got himself a place at the table with the NBA legends. With a driving layup at the 4:23 mark of the fourth quarter against the Phoenix Suns, Westbrook notched his 26,711th career point.In that single motion, ""The Brodie"" officially surpassed the legendary Oscar Robertson to become the highest-scoring point guard in the history of the NBA. Moving into 15th place on the league’s all-time scoring list, Westbrook has reached a rare feat that only a few ever dreamed of in their 18th season.With an 8-26 record, the Kings travelled to PHX Arena to lock horns against the current 7th-best team in the West, Phoenix Suns. Though this road game gave fresh wounds to Kings after they faced their 4th straight loss, 102-129, Russell Westbrook reached an individual milestone.Coming into the game, Westbrook trailed Robertson by 16 points. He finished the night with 17 points, bringing his career total to 26,711 points, along with 8 rebounds, and 6 assists while going 6-12 from the field. This milestone is particularly sweet because it cements him as the highest-scoring true point guard to ever play the game.Kings’ head coach, Doug Christie, when asked about Westbrook reaching this milestone, praisingly said, ""I didn’t know he broke another record tonight. (smiles) He continues to break records. Russ is a freak of nature… always been a fan of his. It’s an absolute honor to coach him.”For decades, Robertson’s triple-double records were thought to be untouchable until Westbrook made averaging a triple-double look easy. Along with Oscar Robertson, he has now outscored icons like Dominique Wilkins, Tim Duncan, and Paul Pierce. The next targets on the list are Hakeem Olajuwon (26,946) and Elvin Hayes (27,313).What makes this achievement so remarkable is the time it required to reach the top 15. Now in his 18th season, Russell Westbrook is no longer the primary scoring option, often comes off the bench as a sixth man, but continues to find ways to be productive, be it through his game IQ or veteran experience. This season, Westbrook is shooting a career-high 36% from deep and 42.7% from the field with an average of 14.5 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 7.0 assists.After a turbulent season with Lakers where he failed to meet the expectations, team consistency has been an issue for Westbrook. From 2020-25, he has changed 5 teams and ultimately settled with the Kings in 2025. This was a crucial record, especially since too many questions were raised regarding his performance.For their next meet-up, the Sacramento Kings will be hosting the Milwaukee Bucks at Golden 1 Center this weekend.Also read: NBA’s Highest-Paid Centers This Season: Nikola Jokić, Anthony Davis & More","Russell Westbrook surpassed Oscar Robertson to become the highest-scoring point guard in the history of the NBA.

The Rose Parade, officially known as the Tournament of Roses Parade, is one of America’s most celebrated New Year’s traditions. Held on the New Year's Day in Pasadena, California, every year, the parade includes beautifully decorated floats made with flowers, parade bands, etc. It began in 1890 as a way to show off Pasadena’s pleasant weather during the winters and has now grown into a celebration watched by hundreds of thousands in person and by millions on television. The parade takes place early in the morning along Colorado Boulevard and is followed later in the day by the famous Rose Bowl college football game. Volunteers known as “White Suiters” spend hours each year to help prepare the floats and manage the crowd.In 2026, the parade’s theme was “The Magic in Teamwork”, celebrating unity. The Grand Marshal is a position that leads the parade and takes part in the Rose Bowl coin toss. This new year, that is, in 2026, it was NBA legend Magic Johnson. Johnson’s selection as the Marshal goes not only to his legendary basketball career but also his lifelong commitment to teamwork and community work.Magic Johnson’s commitment as the Grand Marshal of the 137th Rose Parade brought even greater excitement to the much-celebrated moment. Johnson, widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, enjoyed a brief career with the Los Angeles Lakers as their guard, winning NBA championships and NBA MVP honors. He also won a gold medal in the 1992 U.S.Olympic with the “Dream Team”, alongside NBA legends such as Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, Scottie Pippen, and others.Johnson’s life has been centered around teamwork, which sits perfectly with the parade’s theme in 2026. Beyond the NBA, Johnson has achieved success in business and philanthropy, including community service, alongside his wife, Cookie Johnson, who has been a pillar of strength and motivation ever since they have been together. This major impact has made his role as the Grand Marshal especially very meaningful, celebrating both his personal success and his contributions to society.As the Grand Marshal, Magic Johnson rode down Colorado Boulevard as the head of the parade, waving to the crowds. For many fans, watching a sports icon like him take up this role was something even beyond inspirational, especially for the younger generations who may know him more from the legacy he's created off the court. The presence of legendary figures like Johnson is a true reflection of the idea that the forum, as big as the NBA, could be extended beyond sports by engaging in teamwork and community services, which can create some very unforgettable moments for the fans to cherish for a lifetime and beyond. As for the Rose Parade, it continues to be a symbol of unity and celebration.Fans have positively reacted to this gesture by the NBA legend Magic Johnson, taking up the role of the Grand Marshal. “Hardest workin man in LA, see you in Maui or Monarc beach soon!”, one fan commented. “Thank you Mr. Johnson”, another one wrote. While a third user added, “The Best Magic”. “You are so rad. You are still the magic man”, another user commented on the post. “Nothing but love for Magic Irwin Johnson.”, a fifth user added. “The goat”, a fan wrote. These comments show the deep respect and admiration people hold for Johnson, not just as a former NBA legend, but also as an inspirational figure, working towards society and making a positive impact on the people. These suggest that Johnson remains a beloved man among his fans, years after his retirement.Also Read: Magic Johnson vs Michael Jordan net worth comparison: Exploring NBA veterans' career earnings, off-court ventures and more","NBA legend Magic Johnson is the Grand Marshal of the 2026 Rose Parade in Pasadena, California.

The Philadelphia 76ers visit the New York Knicks on January 3, 2026, for an Atlantic Division game at Madison Square Garden. Both teams come in dealing with injuries, and those absences could decide how this game plays out.New York has been strong at home, while Philadelphia has held its own on the road. With key players listed as out or questionable on both sides, this game is likely to lean heavily on the stars who are available, especially in the fourth quarter.Philadelphia 76ers will be without Kelly Oubre Jr., who is sidelined with a left knee sprain. Trendon Watford is also out due to a left adductor strain. The biggest question is Joel Embiid, who is listed as probable because of right knee injury management. If he plays, the Sixers gain a clear advantage inside. If not, their frontcourt becomes much thinner.The New York Knicks are also missing important pieces. Josh Hart remains out with an ankle injury and has already missed several games. Mitchell Robinson is listed as probable as he continues to manage his own ankle issue. Landry Shamet is unavailable with a shoulder problem, while Karl-Anthony Towns could return after missing time due to illness.Tip-off is set for 7:30 p.m. ET. The game will air on NBA TV nationally, with local broadcasts on NBC Sports Philadelphia and MSG Network. Streaming options include NBA League Pass, the ESPN app, and Fubo.New York enters the night at 23-11 and has been one of the league’s best home teams, going 15-3 at Madison Square Garden. Even with recent injuries, the Knicks have stayed competitive by controlling the glass and limiting second chances.Philadelphia is 18-14 overall and 9-6 on the road. Tyrese Maxey has carried the offense, averaging 30.9 points per game, especially when Embiid’s minutes are managed. The Sixers have had success with strong second quarters, but injuries have made it harder to sustain that level across a full game.The guard matchup between Maxey and Jalen Brunson will set the tone. Both control the pace and take most of the late-game shots. If Embiid plays, his minutes against the Knicks’ bigs will matter just as much. Bench production is another concern, as both teams are missing rotation players.New York is favored by 3.5 points at home. The total sits around 232.5 points. The Knicks are listed between -162 and -166 on the moneyline, with Philadelphia between +136 and +138.

Jaipur: After a difficult few weeks — first dealing with an injury setback and then the disappointment of being dropped from India’s T20 World Cup squad — Shubman Gill will get a chance to rediscover his white-ball rhythm when the India’s Test and ODI skipper turns out for Punjab against Sikkim in the fifth round of the Vijay Hazare Trophy on Saturday.Much to the disappointment of Gill fans, the match will be played behind closed doors at the Jaipuria Vidyalaya ground, which doesn’t have the seating capacity of the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, where around 20,000 spectators enjoyed Rohit Sharma ’s ton last week.Gill, who will miss his Punjab opening partner Abhishek Sharma — the dashing southpaw returned home following the first two games — will look to make the most of these two Vijay Hazare matches to put the recent disappointment behind him. Besides Gill, left-arm speedster Arshdeep Singh will also play for Punjab in the next couple of matches.",India's Test and ODI skipper turns out for Punjab against Sikkim.

IND vs NZ: Rishabh Pant at the heart of a fierce selection debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ind-vs-nz-rishabh-pant-at-the-heart-of-a-fierce-selection-debate/articleshow/126316438.cms,"Rishabh Pant (PTI Photo/Shailendra Bhojak)

Why Mohammed Shami needs to return in India colours before World Cup





New Delhi: The current Indian team management’s go-to word has been ‘flexibility’. Now, it remains to be seen whether the selectors continue to experiment or opt for continuity. At the centre of this debate is Rishabh Pant By standard team-building logic, Pant’s place in the 15-member squad shouldn’t be in doubt. He has warmed the bench as KL Rahul ’s backup wicketkeeper for the last 18 months. Since coming back from a car accident, he has played only one ODI — on a rank turner in Sri Lanka in Aug 2024. Before the accident, Pant averaged over 41 with a strike rate close to 110 while batting at No. 4. Much has changed since. Gautam Gambhir has consolidated his influence as head coach. Rohit Sharma has been replaced by Shubman Gill as captain. ‘Flexibility’ and an aversion to superstar culture have become core principles of selection.Three ODIs against New Zealand may not seem significant. But India will play only 20 or so ODIs before the 2027 World Cup. “The team management and selection committee did a good job when they started the transition process. But constant chopping and changing doesn’t help stability. If Pant has been your No. 2 wicketkeeper and is dropped without playing, you are challenging your own selection process. There needs to be consistency in selection, otherwise it doesn’t send a good signal to players coming up the ranks,” former national selector Devang Gandhi told TOI.It is understood that the selectors wanted to rotate Pant and Rahul as wicketkeepers in the six home ODIs this season. However, the continued reluctance to play Pant suggests a lack of trust in his abilities. Similar situations have played out in Test cricket with Shardul Thakur and Nitish Kumar Reddy, when the management and captain did not appear to be on the same page.“My only fear is a repeat of 2019, when you didn’t prepare backups in the middle order. Pant can still serve for another seven to eight years. If they feel they can maximise his potential, they must start working with him. He has been part of the system since 2018. If not, they must identify a definite second wicketkeeper — and not keep changing without giving the player a full run, because there aren’t many ODIs before the World Cup,” former India wicketkeeper and broadcaster Deep Dasgupta said.Pant hasn’t set the stage on fire in the Vijay Hazare Trophy on sticky Bengaluru pitches. “I won’t judge him by the runs. He hasn’t played the 50-over format for nearly three-and-a-half years. Before his accident, he had started finding his feet in ODIs. It’s about how much you want to back him,” Dasgupta added.",Rishabh Pant has warmed the bench as KL Rahul’s backup wicketkeeper for the last 18 months.

Ian Bishop press conference: 'Batters have always been seen as heroes and bowlers as villains'

Batters have always been seen as the heroes and bowlers the villains. Even when I was playing that was always the battle Ian Bishop

Year Total Runs (T20s) Average Runs per Team 2025 4,62,258 295.37 2024 4,74,631 285.40 2023 3,49,643 288.00 2022 3,86,865 280.54 2021 3,49,170 281.81 2020 1,80,197 296.86

Poll Do you believe that the rise in T20 scores is improving the excitement of the game? Absolutely! It's thrilling. Somewhat. It depends on the match. Not really. I prefer lower scores. I have no opinion on this.





The number of runs cricketers score in the T20 cricket continues to climb each year since the turn of the decade. In 2025, 4,62,258 runs were scored across the world in game's shortest format. On an average, each team scored 295.37 runs per match.Punjab scored 310 against Bengal in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy with Abhishek Sharma scoring a 52-ball 148. At the international level, England walloped South Africa by scoring 304 runs, thanks to Phil Salt's unbeaten 60-ball 141 and Jos Buttler's 30-ball 83.Big scores remain the central objective for everyone involved - curators with batting-friendly pitches; lawmakers allowing broader bats and organisers promising run fest to bring fans to the stadiums or keep them hooked to the TV.The average score in the T20 format in the past five years reads: 281.81 (2021), 280.54 (2022), 288.00 (2023), 285.40 (2024) and 295.37 (2025). The year the first T20I was played (2005), the average was 275.19.Given the adulation they get, does that make a batter more attractive to the next generation of cricketers? Former West Indies speedster Ian Bishop doesn't think so.""I don't think everybody wants to be a batter. I still think there is room in the game for those who want to bowl fast, those who want to bowl wrist spin, those who want to bowl finger spin,"" said Bishop, who is a commentator in the ongoing ILT20.""Historically, and we go back to the inception of the game, batters have always been seen as the heroes and bowlers the villains. Even when I was playing that was always the battle,"" he continued to explain with a smile.""I do think you are absolutely right in the respect that the game kind of has drifted more and more in favour of the batters but I still think guys want to come through. And bowlers are an adaptable species. The more the game changes, the more bowlers will come up with plans to counter it. That has always been the ebb and flow of cricket generally - red ball or white ball or T20.""As administrators though, what I will agree with you on is that we have to do a better job of creating a better balance between bat and ball even in T20 cricket,"" he reasoned.This isn't the only radical change he wants to make to the modern game. The 58-year-old, who played 43 Test matches for the Windies, is a strong advocate for four-day Test matches.""I have long been in favour of 4-day Test cricket. This is especially true if you are going to have a World Test Championship (WTC) where results are imperative, necessitating pitches that yield results.""But the arguments against it from others is (about) weather impacting games and then there is no coming back. But if you ask me, I have long said publicly, I am a 4-day Test cricket fan.The ICC had approved four-day Tests for bilateral series in 2017, with England facing Zimbabwe over four days at Trent Bridge last year, following four-day Tests against Ireland in 2019 and 2023. Four-day Tests have as yet not been played under the World Test Championship (WTC) format.Many smaller nations are hesitant to host Tests because of the time they require and the cost. However, shifting to four-day cricket could allow a full three-Test series to be completed in under three weeks. In four-day Tests, playing hours are extended to ensure a minimum of 98 overs per day (instead of 90) to help offset the time lost.",Ian Bishop says batters have always been seen as heroes and bowlers as villains.

Kawhi Leonard’s contract breakdown



How Kawhi Leonard's contract hit Clippers’ bench







After a spectacular season with Toronto Raptors in 2018-19, Kawhi Leonard decided to move closer to his house and signed with the LA Clippers. To make a championship worthy team, Leonard put forward the condition of acquiring another star player before signing, and the Clippers fulfilled it by getting Paul George in a blockbuster deal.With the league’s expansion, all eyes are always scanning the crowd for the next big trade, but Kawhi and the Clippers front office quietly handled their business back in early 2024 with a three-year, $149.5 million veteran extension. For all those die-hard fans of Leonard, this was a statement: Kawhi isn't going anywhere, and Steve Ballmer is more than willing to pay for that elite talent.Kawhi Leonard was drafted 15th overall by the Indiana Pacers in 2011 but was immediately traded to the San Antonio Spurs where he stayed till 2017-28 season. After joining the Raptors over a 1-year deal worth $23 million for 2018-19 season, Kawhi led the franchise to its first ever NBA championship and won his second Finals MVP.Since joining Clippers in 2019 on a 3-year $103 million contract that was active till 2021, the management and Leonardo decided to sign another maximum extension worth $176 million that would keep the latter in the team through 2024 season.On January 14 2024, Clippers via a social media post announced that they have signed another contract extension with Kawhi Leonard.It is a 3-year contract worth $149.5 million keeping Leonardo with the Clipper through the 2027 season.Through this deal, Leonard is guaranteed to earn $149.5 million with an average annual salary of $49 million in 2024. For the 2025-26 season, he will earn $50 million and $50.3 million for 2026-27. By the time the 2026-27 season wraps up, his career on-court earnings will cross past the $425 million mark becoming one of the highest on-court earners in NBA.From a front-office perspective, Kawhi’s contract is a massive anchor on the salary cap. Carrying a $50 million cap hit for each of the next two seasons means the Clippers are essentially living in the luxury tax. Because he signed for slightly below his absolute maximum, it gave the team just enough breathing room to keep guys like James Harden around, but let’s be real, the NBA’s CBA is always breathing down everyone’s necks.There’s no player option on the back end of this deal, meaning Kawhi is committed through 2027. For the fans, that’s the best part. They don't have to worry about ""opt-out"" rumors every summer. All they hope is that Kawhi Leonard stays healthy and fit and continues to perform dominantly on the court.Also read: Here are the 5 tallest players in today’s NBA: Victor Wembanyama, Zach Edey, and more","Kawhi Leonard signed a three-year, $149.5 million veteran extension with the LA Clippers.

Jordan Love pays a tribute to his father, Orbin Jr. through his jersey number “10”





Professional volleyball player for a Mom and NFL quarterback for a Dad…this kid’s going to be an athlete for sure: a Green Bay Packers fan page on Instagram commented on Jordan Love and wife Ronica Stone Love’s collaborative pregnancy announcement. They captioned it: “New year, new addition,” and shared seven wholesome snapshots. The couple reportedly chose their home as the backdrop for their classic denim-and-white maternity photoshoot.The first image shows the two in matching white t-shirts and sky-blue denim jeans. Ronika reportedly chose a no-makeup look because a common pregnancy sign, “linea nigra,” was visible on her tummy. This harmless dark vertical line on the abdomen during pregnancy is caused by increased melanin production from hormonal changes. The “pregnancy line” fades after childbirth. What were the other snapshots shared by the expectant couple? Let’s check them out one by one.The first image shared by The Love Couple featured six slideshows of their baby’s sonogram. The second image shows a monochrome silhouette of the two facing each other, with Jordan landing a warm peck on Ronika’s forehead. The backdrop stands out in the second snapshot: a large transparent arched window reveals a dense forest of bare trees and snow-covered ground, perfectly depicting winter.The third image shows Ronika on Jordan’s lap, his hands gently encircling her tummy. Ronika tenderly holds Jordan’s hand while looking at her tummy with fondness. Brownie points for how their wedding rings also encircle the baby.The fourth image shows the pregnant couple, standing before the same large, transparent arched window. Ronika stands in front of Jordan in the monochrome photo, looking back at him with her brightest smile. Jordan looks at her with boundless love. Both hold the tummy tenderly.The fifth image features Jordan’s back profile with Ronika standing in front of him. They look into each other’s eyes. The highlight: Ronika holds a cream-colored knitted baby romper with ruffle details around its legs. The romper has “BABY Love SPRING 2026” knitted in lavender pink.The sixth image shows Ronika comfortably seated on a beige couch while Jordan takes her photo on his smartphone. The image focuses on Ronika and blurs the Green Bay quarterback.The last image shows Ronika, her face obscured, focusing on a tiny jersey she holds. The jersey reads “LOVE” with the number “10,” which is Jordan Love’s Green Bay Packers number.“My dad [Orbin Jr.] wore number 10 when he was in high school,” Jordan told Ryan Wood of Green Bay Press-Gazette in September 2024. “That was a tribute to him. When I was younger, I started wearing 10. I think, like sixth grade, seventh grade, I started wearing 10, and it kind of just stuck with me. Definitely a tribute to my dad, he wore number 10.”Also Read: Jordan Love latest injury update: Packers QB ruled out for Week 17 matchup against Baltimore Ravens due to NFL’s concussion protocol","Green Bay Packers quarterback Jordan Love and University of Oregon star Ronika Stone Love are expecting their first baby.
