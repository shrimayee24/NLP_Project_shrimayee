Denise DeBartolo York’s family net worth hit $8.4B on the 2025 Forbes 400

The San Francisco 49ers and Leeds United explain the York family’s money trail





Denise DeBartolo York and her family landed at No. 163 on the 2025 Forbes 400, with Forbes estimating their net worth at $8.4 billion. That figure comes from Forbes’ latest ranking, as reported Sept. 19, 2025.This is not some mystery-money story. Forbes ties the York family fortune primarily to their ownership of the San Francisco 49ers, where the family holds more than 90% of the franchise.The Forbes 400 list is basically a “you’re in or you’re out” snapshot of America’s richest. In 2025, Forbes said the 400 wealthiest Americans held $6.6 trillion combined, and you needed at least $3.8 billion to make the cut.The York family cleared that bar easily. WFMJ’s report notes the family’s wealth has climbed hard over the last decade, tracking Forbes wealth history data: $1.9 billion in 2016, $3.2 billion by 2020, and then the 2025 Forbes 400 estimate at $8.4 billion.They also landed ahead of other famous names on that same 2025 list, including Mark Cuban and Steven Spielberg, per the same report.Here’s the straight line: Edward DeBartolo Sr. bought the San Francisco 49ers for $13 million in 1977, and the family still controls the franchise today.Denise DeBartolo York took control of the 49ers in 2000. Her oldest son, Jed York, is now the team’s CEO. Forbes also lists the 49ers as the NFL’s sixth-most valuable franchise, and the team finished as the Super Bowl runner-up in 2023.Then the family pushed further into global soccer. The 49ers’ ownership arm agreed to buy the remaining 56% stake in Leeds United in 2023 after already owning 44%.The WFMJ report said the family paid more than $200 million to acquire that remaining stake.Today, Denise York’s son Jed York oversees daily operations as CEO, with the family continuing to invest heavily in the team’s roster, facilities, and long term competitiveness.Bottom line: the Yorks aren’t climbing because of a random side hustle. Their net worth rises when their sports assets rise. And the biggest one is still the 49ers.Denise DeBartolo York and her family landed at No. 163 on the latest Forbes 400, with an estimated net worth of $8.4 billion, driven largely by their majority ownership of the San Francisco 49ers, which Forbes ranks as the National Football League’s sixth most valuable franchise. York, who took control of the team in 2000, now sees her son Jed York serving as CEO, while the family has also expanded into global soccer with their takeover of Leeds United in 2023.Their ranking places them ahead of billionaires like Mark Cuban, Stephen Spielberg, and Donald Trump, underscoring how central sports ownership has been to the York family’s growing financial power. In recent years, the organization has also explored outside investment interest, driven by the team’s soaring valuation and the NFL’s evolving ownership rules.","Denise DeBartolo York and her family landed at No. 163 on the 2025 Forbes 400, with Forbes estimating their net worth at $8.4 billion.

Maria Hanslovan’s fitness career, joint assets, and net worth of the duo





The brilliant career in Major League Baseball was the main factor that created the foundation of Andrew McCutchen’s finances. In 2005, the Pittsburgh Pirates called him up without delay, he threw at the peak of his superstar career, and later, he was awarded five All-Star titles and the National League MVP in 2013. Maria Hanslovan, McCutchen's wife, has set up her own fitness and wellness career which has been a steady income source for the couple and thus, has improved their financial stability.Through 16 seasons in the majors, McCutchen's total money earned from the MLB contracts was about $131.4 million. The highest salary he got was in 2012 when he agreed to a six-year deal, $51.5 million contract extension with the Pirates, thus making the player the franchise’s mainstay.Later transfers to teams like San Francisco Giants, Philadelphia Phillies, and Milwaukee Brewers accounted for even more millions, while his signing of a one-year $5 million contract renewal with the Pirates in 2025 is a testament to both his status as a veteran and his continuing worth to the team. Salaries, however, were not the only way, as he was also coming into the picture through endorsement deals by the likes of Nike and Marucci Sports, whose reputation he was in part making as a respected leader and role model.His public persona of being involved in philanthropy and community outreach, among other things, has made him more marketable and has thus provided him with the needed steady income streams even if he stops playing already.Formal fitness certifications play a minor role in Maria's career; the major part is the inspiration drawn from her personal story. Maria has made herself a confidante in the health and wellness area by sharing her training, eating habits, and playful family life. Her power is not restricted to the fitness world. She represents a person who supports McCutchen's cause and, at the same time, flourishes on her own.Collectively, the MLB power couple, Andrew McCutchen and Maria Hanslovan have $60-$65 million. Their wealth keeps rising from professional careers and joint assets alongside brand deals.

How Anthony Edwards’ status affects the game





ahead of their January 6, 2026 home game against the Miami Heat at Target Center. He was added to the injury report late in the day and is listed as questionable due to right foot injury maintenance.The timing matters. Minnesota is coming off a win over Miami in this short two-game set, and Edwards has been central to that success. His late appearance on the report has shifted attention away from the matchup itself and toward whether the Wolves will have their leading scorer on the floor at tip-off.Anthony Edwards is dealing with right foot maintenance, the same issue that caused him to miss multiple games in December. This is not a new injury, but it is something the team has monitored closely throughout the season. The questionable tag was added only hours before the scheduled 7:00 PM ET start.Minnesota has not indicated that Edwards suffered any setback in his last outing. The listing appears precautionary, especially given his recent workload and the tight schedule. As of now, no final decision has been announced, and his status could change shortly before game time.Before landing on the injury report, Edwards was playing at a high level. He scored 33 points in Minnesota’s 125–115 win over Miami and followed that with a 35-point performance against Washington, along with four steals. He is averaging 28.7 points per game this season, placing him among the league’s top scorers.If Anthony Edwards is unavailable, Minnesota will need to adjust quickly. Guards like Bones Hyland and Mike Conley would take on more responsibility, while the offense would rely more on half-court execution rather than Edwards’ shot creation.Miami enters the game in relatively better shape. Tyler Herro is available after dealing with toe issues and will play alongside Bam Adebayo. Jaime Jaquez Jr. remains out with an ankle sprain. Nikola Jovic and Keshad Johnson are available, while Terry Rozier continues to be sidelined and is not with the team.Minnesota is favored at home, but that edge narrows if Edwards does not play. Without him, the Wolves lean more heavily on Julius Randle and Rudy Gobert for scoring and stability. If Edwards is cleared, Minnesota’s offense looks much closer to what it showed in the previous win. Either way, his status will shape how this rematch unfolds.","Anthony Edwards was added to the Minnesota Timberwolves injury report late in the day.

Jordan Chiles’ former rivals take up new roles







Jordan Chiles began the 2026 NCAA gymnastics season with a statement performance. She won the all-around with a huge 39.725 score. She also topped all four events. UCLA won the meet with 196.975, finishing ahead of California, Washington, and Oregon State. It was the kind of opening night every athlete hopes for. Chiles looked confident after finishing runner-up in 2025.But the story was not only about who was on the floor. Just a few steps away, familiar faces watched from the sidelines. Jade Carey, Haleigh Bryant, and Mya Lauzon were no longer competing. They were coaching. These were the same gymnasts who pushed Chiles throughout the 2025 season. Their presence raised a big question. If they were still competing, would Chiles have dominated the opener so easily?Jade Carey has already embraced her new chapter. After ending her career at Oregon State, she stayed with the program as a Student Assistant Coach. Gymnastics Now shared a moment of her watching closely, with the caption, “Same team, different role for Coach Carey.” Carey knows what it takes to beat the best. In the 2025 NCAA Championships semifinal, she scored 39.6250 in the all-around. Chiles scored 39.5875 in the same session. Carey finished just ahead of her.Haleigh Bryant followed a similar path. One of LSU’s most successful gymnasts, she retired in April 2025.She soon joined LSU’s coaching staff for the 2025–26 season. After watching the season opener, she posted, “Nights like these are why it was so easy to stay.” Bryant had posted a 39.5625 all-around score in the 2025 semifinals. That was very close to Chiles’ numbers.Mya Lauzon also moved into coaching. After a strong career at Cal, she returned in 2026 as an assistant coach. She shared the opener scores on Instagram and wrote, “Just the beginning for these bears.” Lauzon had tied for the all-around title at the 2025 ACC Championships with 39.625.Jordan Chiles still proved her class. She once posted a season-high 39.775 at the 2025 team final. But if her former rivals were still competing, winning would not have been this easy for her.

Magic Johnson and Larry Bird's NBA rivalry still commands the spotlight



How Magic Johnson and Larry Bird forged the modern NBA







The NBA Hall of Famer Magic Johnson revealed that he recently joined Larry Bird on stage in Phoenix, Arizona, where the two icons revisited the rivalry that helped define an era of professional sports.The appearance was not framed around trophies or debates about greatness. It centered on shared history, storytelling, and the lasting pull of competition. Johnson’s update takes the audience at the venue in Arizona back to the good old days. It also showed how the rivalry that once fueled the NBA’s rise still draws crowds decades later.Magic Johnson shared the moment in his own words, describing the energy inside the venue and the response from the audience.""Larry Bird and I spoke to an amazing audience of 4,000 at the Axon Company Kickoff today in Phoenix, Arizona. We had the crowd going crazy and they ate up all the stories about our rivalry! Thank you to Axon Enterprise CEO Rick Smith and Axon President Josh Isner for having us today! This was an incredible event for Josh because he idolized Larry Bird growing up,"" Johnson wrote on X.Magic Johnson and Larry Bird's rivalry is rooted in basketball culture.Their competitive story began long before the NBA, when Johnson’s Michigan State team defeated Bird’s Indiana State squad in the 1979 NCAA championship game. That matchup became the most-watched title game in college basketball history and set the stage for what followed.Both stars entered the league that same year, landing with franchises that already carried history. Johnson joined the Los Angeles Lakers. Bird became the face of the Boston Celtics. Their individual rivalry soon mirrored the league’s most famous team feud.During the 1980s, Johnson and Bird met three times in the NBA Finals. Bird claimed the first battle in 1984. Johnson responded with championships in 1985 and 1987. Johnson finished with three league MVP awards and 12 All-Star selections, but Bird was not leaving Johnson’s stats and accolades diminish his personal glory as the NBA legend also climbed the ladder to the top with him.Their influence extended beyond wins and losses. At a time when the NBA faced declining interest, their rivalry helped restore credibility and excitement. Passing, court vision, and team play became central to the league’s identity.That legacy has remained visible through documentaries and television dramatizations, including the HBO film Magic & Bird: A Courtship of Rivals and the series Winning Time.Also Read: WNBA star Cameron Brink celebrates fiancé’s birthday with sweet personal note alongside romantic snapshots","Magic Johnson and Larry Bird revisited the rivalry that helped define an era of professional sports.

Out of the commotion of the ball park, the post they shot a small yet significant family moment which was very relatable.The emphasis was made on home and tradition and excitement of a child during the holiday season instead of workouts or appearing in the newspapers. This clip immediately found a fan base that is always intrigued by the lives of athletes when the season is off.

She seemed to have her full attention, to be poking, with placid curiosity, at the instrument as the room was crowded with holiday gifts and decorations. The Story was captioned by Katia Lindor, who wrote, “She’d been asking for a blue violin and well, the 3 kings obliged💙.”The simplicity was what made the moment stand out.

Three proposed bills target demolition costs, tax credits , and new fees on fans





The Kansas City Chiefs’ decision to leave Arrowhead Stadium has triggered more than disappointment inside Missouri, as it has now sparked a legislative response. As the state prepares for a new session, a Missouri senator has introduced a series of bills that would financially impact professional teams that relocate out of state.While the Chiefs are not named directly, the proposals are clearly aligned with their planned move to Kansas once their lease expires in 2031. The effort reflects growing frustration among some lawmakers who believe Missouri taxpayers are being left behind after years of public investment in the team and its stadium.Sen. Nick Schroer, a Republican from Defiance, filed three separate bills designed to address what he views as a financial imbalance between teams and taxpayers. The first proposal would require any professional sports team playing in a publicly owned facility with a capacity of at least 60,000 to pay demolition costs. This applies when the stadium is left in a condition that is not “reasonably adaptable” for another use, which fits Arrowhead Stadium.The second bill would eliminate tax credits for professional teams that play in stadiums holding at least 75,000 fans, which fits the Chiefs.The third measure would impose new charges once a team announces plans to relocate to another state. Under that proposal, teams would be required to add a $50 fee to every ticket sold and an extra 5% charge on all in-stadium purchases.Schroer rejected claims that the bills are meant as punishment. Instead, he framed them as a way to protect public funds. He said, “If we’ve got an entity who’s benefiting from taxpayers, tax credits or whatever it may be, and they’re giving us the middle finger, I think we need to reevaluate doing business with them.”Schroer added, “If they’re leaving a stadium that we’ve had a lot of our tax dollars going toward fixing and promoting, then I think that we need to have a good faith discussion...on how we’re going to address (that) once they leave.” Schroer also emphasized his plans to introduce legislation removing the Chiefs’ designation as Missouri’s official NFL teamDespite the attention, the bills face long odds. House Speaker Jonathan Patterson expressed skepticism, noting lawmakers have broader priorities. As of now, the team declined to comment on the proposals.Also read: Chiefs quietly prepare for life after Travis Kelce as draft buzz grows around a new tight end option","Three proposed bills target demolition costs, tax credits, and new fees on fans.

Brady Tkachuk stays calm while talking about the punch from Logan Stanley







Ottawa Senators captain Brady Tkachuk faced a tense moment on the ice earlier this month during a game against the Winnipeg Jets. The incident happened midway through the second period of Ottawa’s 4-2 win on January 3, highlighting the physical nature of the game and the challenges players face in high-pressure NHL games.The altercations involved a punch thrown by the Jets’ defenseman, Logan Stanley, who punched Tkachuk when he was still involved in the action on the ice. Referees stepped in immediately and gave Tkachuk a misconduct penalty with an assessment of ten minutes, and later suspended the player. The event sparked discussions around discipline, player safety, and the limits of aggressive play in the league.Tkachuk described the moment as completely unexpected. “Honestly, I was still watching the play, and then out of the corner of my eye I just see the punch coming. Caught me by surprise. I didn't expect it,” he said. Despite the incident, he quickly moved past it, returning to the game and recording an assist to help Ottawa secure the win.Video review confirmed Tkachuk was not facing Stanley when the punch landed, a key factor in the league’s decision. He added, “The league made its decision. I'm over it, I could care less now, it's in the past.” He stayed focused on helping his team, showing why he’s considered a strong leader on and off the ice.The incident didn’t distract him from Ottawa’s game plan.Stanley, who has relied heavily on physical play this season, has already recorded 82 penalty minutes through 40 games, surpassing his career high. His suspension sidelines him for the Jets’ home game against the Vegas Golden Knights, though he is expected back against the Edmonton Oilers later this week. Ottawa’s win extended Winnipeg’s losing streak to nine games, underscoring both the Senators’ momentum and Tkachuk’s leadership on the ice.The incident highlights the NHL's focus on player safety while being able to show the fine line between aggressive play and disciplinary action. Tkachuk's calm and measured response shows professionalism under pressure, while Stanley's approach does represent the fragility associated with physical enforcement in high-intensity games.Also Read: Jets defenseman Logan Stanley receives one-game suspension for incident involving Ottawa Senators captain Brady Tkachuk",Brady Tkachuk was punched in the face by Winnipeg Jets defenseman Logan Stanley.

Jaylen Brown and Kendall Jenner





The intersection of professional basketball and the Kardashian-Jenner empire has become one of the most persistent storylines in modern sports media. For over a decade, courtside seats at NBA arenas have served as the backdrop for high-profile romances that often dominate headlines as much as the games themselves. This combination of hardwood players with the glitz of show business has been a cultural crossover, with critics often debating the impact of these pairings. But the tabloid has a field day with this fodder.The list of the NBA superstars who have headlined entertainment sites due to their relationship with the cast of Keeping Up With the Kardashians could create another superstar roster by itself. Let’s dive in and see how these couples navigated the pressure of the court and the spotlight of reality television.The most significant early chapter of this trend began with the Los Angeles Lakers star. His 2009 whirlwind marriage to Khloé Kardashian was a cornerstone of the family’s media rise, even spawning a spin-off series. Despite his success as a two-time NBA champion, his personal struggles eventually led to a high-profile split, though the two remained legally entangled for years.Khloe and McCants' relationship could be seen as the first on the list after they briefly dated from late 2008 to early 2009.The pair later appeared on KUWTK in late 2009, while Khloe was married to Lamar Odom, where Khloe claimed McCants had cheated on her. But McCants later stated that the entire thing was nothing but a fabricated storyline to keep the show interesting. This highly publicised relationship, as claimed by McCants, “negatively affected” his career and cost him some big bucks.Perhaps the most scrutinized marriage in the family’s history occurred in 2011 when Kim Kardashian married the New Jersey Nets’ forward. The union famously lasted only 72 days before a divorce filing sparked months of tabloid speculation. Though the relationship was brief, it cemented the connection between the league and the Calabasas-based family.During a period of transition, Khloe Kardashian was linked to the prolific scoring guard. Their relationship in 2015 brought a new level of media attention to the Houston Rockets star, who later admitted that the intensity of the public spotlight was a challenge to manage alongside his professional commitments.No relationship on this list has seen more public ups and downs than the one between Khloé and the Cleveland Cavaliers center. Spanning several years and involving the birth of two children, their timeline has been defined by multiple reconciliations and very public controversies, keeping them at the center of the news cycle long after Thompson’s championship run.The family’s interest in the league shifted toward the younger generation when Kendall Jenner began dating the high-flying forward in 2017. The romance rumours sparked shortly after Griffin's split from his ex-fiance, Brynn Cameron. The relationship between Griffin and Kendall only lasted till early 2018, after reported suggested the couple has ""cooled off."" During his transition from the Clippers to the Pistons, the two were a frequent sight at concerts and dinners, representing a shift toward a more private, yet still highly visible, dating style.Continuing the trend of elite guards and forwards, Kendall was later linked to the Philadelphia 76ers standout. Their on-again, off-again relationship was a staple of 2018 and 2019, often highlighted by Kendall’s appearances at the Wells Fargo Center.The most enduring of the recent pairings involved the Phoenix Suns star. Devin Booker and Kendall were an item for over two years, frequently appearing on each other’s social media and attending high-profile events like the U.S. Open. Even after a reported split in late 2022, the couple was spotted together in late 2024 and early 2025, fueling the rumors, and it persisted well into 2025 as they seemed to communicate actively.The most recent addition to the rumor mill of NBA players and Kardashian-Jenner involves the Boston Celtics star, Jaylen Brown. Just barely six days into 2026, reports began to circulate linking him and Kendall Jenner, suggesting that despite her brief pivots toward the music industry, the connection between the supermodel and the NBA’s elite remains as strong as ever.Also read: The 5 highest-paid coaches in NBA right now: Steve Kerr, Mike Brown, and more","The intersection of professional basketball and the Kardashian-Jenner empire has become one of the most persistent storylines in modern sports media.

Alex Wennberg will allow San Jose Sharks to build their forward line around Macklin Celebrini

Also Read:





With the re-signing of Alex Wennberg, the San Jose Sharks are looking poised to finally build a playoff-caliber team. The Swedish center’s three-year contract extension will allow the management to experiment with what works for them while continuing to have some much-needed veteran presence.Wennberg’s $6 million AAV shows that the Sharks have faith in him. With rookie sensation Macklin Celebrini already breaking records, the team understands that they need playoff experience and consistent production to help a young roster learning how to compete.Wennberg has already established himself as a regular on playoff contenders. He spent six seasons with Columbus, posting at least 30 points three times while contributing to multiple postseason appearances. His time with the expansion Seattle Kraken proved equally productive.He has already helped the franchise reach the second round of the Western Conference playoffs during his second season with the team. The veteran center's playoff pedigree extends to last season, when he joined the New York Rangers.Wennberg helped them secure the President's Trophy and played all 16 postseason games during their run to the Eastern Conference Final.That experience is invaluable for a Sharks team that hasn't tasted playoff hockey in years.So far, Wennberg has met the expectations with which the Sharks welcomed him to their club, with him earning 35 points across 77 regular-season games last season. This season he is continuing to boost the Sharks' points production with 26 points in 41 games, putting him on pace for one of his greatest NHL campaigns.The timing of Wennberg's extension aligns perfectly with the Sharks' rebuild timeline. Logan Couture's contract comes off the books after the 2026-27 season, and other senior deals like those of Jeff Skinner and Ryan Reaves expire this year.That creates financial flexibility for San Jose to make additional roster moves and re-signings over the next few seasons. With Celebrini enjoying a phenomenal sophomore season and the Sharks pushing back into playoff contention, locking up Wennberg provides stability at center ice.The veteran's consistent production and playoff experience will be vital as San Jose's young core matures and learns what it takes to win in high-pressure situations. The extension signals that the Sharks believe their rebuild is progressing ahead of schedule. Wennberg won't just be part of the rebuild anymore. He'll be part of the contending team that emerges on the other side.","Alex Wennberg has signed a three-year contract extension with the San Jose Sharks.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

Poll Do you agree with the ICC's decision to not relocate Bangladesh's matches due to player safety concerns? Yes, they should stay in India. No, they should relocate to a safer venue.





NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has found no actionable security inputs to support Bangladesh’s concerns over player safety in India and has, for now, rejected the Bangladesh Cricket Board’s (BCB) request to relocate its matches from the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026.According to a Cricbuzz report, the issue was discussed during an online meeting between ICC officials and BCB representatives on Tuesday (January 6). During the call, the ICC informed the BCB that it has no assessment indicating any specific or credible threat to the Bangladesh team while playing in India. As a result, the global body sees no basis to alter the tournament schedule or venues at this stage.The meeting followed an emergency BCB gathering on January 4, after which the board formally wrote to the ICC asking that Bangladesh’s matches be moved outside India to “safeguard the safety and well-being of Bangladeshi players, team officials, Board members and other stakeholders.” However, the ICC’s position does not currently align with that request. While no final written decision was issued on Tuesday, sources indicate there are no immediate signs of the ICC revising its stance.A formal response is expected by January 10.Bangladesh are scheduled to play three Group C matches in Kolkata — against West Indies on February 7, Italy on February 9 and England on February 14 — before facing Nepal in Mumbai on February 17.Conflicting accounts have emerged regarding the tone of the ICC’s communication. ESPNcricinfo reported that the ICC told the BCB it was rejecting the relocation request and that Bangladesh would need to travel to India to play the tournament or risk forfeiting points. The BCB, however, has denied receiving any such ultimatum. Neither the ICC nor the BCCI has issued an official statement on the outcome of the call.The development comes less than a month before the 20-team tournament begins on February 7 across India and Sri Lanka, with the final scheduled for March 8.The BCB’s letter to the ICC was triggered by the BCCI’s directive to Kolkata Knight Riders to release Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman , who had been bought at the IPL auction for INR 9.2 crore. The decision was confirmed publicly by BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia, though no official reason was provided. It is understood that the IPL Governing Council did not meet on the issue, raising questions over the decision-making process.In response, the BCB banned the broadcast of the IPL in Bangladesh. Meanwhile, Mustafizur is set to feature in the Pakistan Super League , a move confirmed by the Pakistan Cricket Board, adding another layer to an increasingly tense standoff — even as the ICC maintains that, on security grounds, it is status quo for Bangladesh at the World Cup.",Bangladesh are scheduled to play three matches in Kolkata and one in Mumbai.

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma on Tuesday politely declined a fan’s offer of a vada pav, keeping his focus firmly on preparations for India’s upcoming ODI series against New Zealand.The Indian batter, who recently turned out for Mumbai in two Vijay Hazare Trophy matches, has been spending extended hours in training with the series set to begin on Sunday.A video circulating widely on social media shows him getting ready for a practice session when a fan approaches and asks in Marathi whether he would like a vada pav.Rohit responds with a smile, politely refusing the offer before resuming his training.Soon after the clip gained traction, the ‘Hitman’ posted a photo on Instagram of himself working in the nets, offering a glimpse into the effort he is putting in ahead of the series.The former India captain has enjoyed a landmark year, highlighted by a string of achievements and records. He played a decisive role in India’s ICC Champions Trophy triumph, anchoring the final with a match-winning 76 to seal the title.Rohit also reached the top of the ICC ODI batting rankings for the first time in his career and moved up to become India’s third-highest run-scorer in the format.Last month, he joined an elite club by crossing 20,000 runs in international cricket during the third and final ODI against South Africa in Visakhapatnam, becoming only the fourth Indian to reach the milestone.His power-hitting credentials were further underlined in November when he overtook Shahid Afridi’s long-standing record for the most sixes in ODIs. The feat came in the first ODI against South Africa at the JSCA Stadium in Ranchi, where his 352nd maximum took him past Afridi’s 351, a record that had stood since 2015. With 279 ODIs under his belt, Rohit has now struck 355 sixes in the format.Rohit signed off the 2025 year with 650 runs from 14 innings at an average of 50.00 and a strike rate in excess of 100, including two centuries and four fifties, with a highest score of 121.",Rohit Sharma politely declines a fan's offer of a vada pav.

'He does not belong here': When Sanjay Manjrekar questioned Kohli's place in Tests; how Virat replied,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/he-does-not-belong-here-when-sanjay-manjrekar-questioned-kohlis-place-in-tests-how-virat-replied/articleshow/126377573.cms,"Sanjay Manjrekar, Virat Kohli

Can Virat Kohli chase down Sachin Tendulkar's hundred hundreds?





Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar ’s reaction to Virat Kohli’s Test retirement has brought back memories of a comment he made more than a decade ago, when Kohli’s place in the Indian Test side was under question during the 2011–12 tour of Australia.In Januray 2012, after India’s heavy loss in the second Test in Sydney, Manjrekar suggested giving Virat one more Test just to be sure ""he does not belong here"". The remark came at a time when Kohli had managed modest scores in his first two Tests of the series and faced growing scrutiny over his spot in the XI.More than a decade later, Manjrekar is again speaking about Kohli, this time expressing disappointment over his decision to retire from Test cricket. The former batter said it was saddening to see Kohli walk away from the format while contemporaries Joe Root Steve Smith and Kane Williamson continue to perform consistently in Test cricket.Posting on his official Instagram account, Manjrekar said the decision made him feel sad, particularly when he watches players like Root, Smith and Williamson continue to score runs and shape their Test careers.Manjrekar added that despite his struggles in recent years, Kohli still had the fitness and desire to attempt a return to form. He felt Kohli could have tried more options before deciding to retire from Test cricket.""I just feel sad that people like Joe Root and Steve Smith, Kane Williamson are really making a name for themselves in Test Cricket. It was okay, Virat Kohli just walked away from cricket, retired from all cricket. But that he's chosen to play one day cricket actually disappoints me more, because this is a format which for a top-order batter, I've said before as well, is the easiest format,"" he added.This is not the first time Manjrekar has publicly commented on Kohli’s career.Kohli had a difficult start to his Test career during India’s tour of the West Indies. He scored 4 and 15 on debut in Kingston, followed by a duck in Kingstown. Those performances did not secure his place immediately.He then made two half-centuries in the home series after being left out of the tour of England, which helped him earn selection for the Test series in Australia later that year.After two matches in Australia, Kohli’s place again came under scrutiny. He scored 11 and 0 in the Melbourne Test, followed by 23 and 9 in Sydney. With India losing the second Test by an innings and 68 runs, selection questions intensified before the third Test at the WACA.After the second Test, Manjrekar wrote on Twitter: ""I would still drop VVS [Laxman] & get Rohit [Sharma] in for next Test. Makes long term sense. Give Virat one more test just to be sure he does not belong here.""Kohli was retained for the third Test. India were dismissed for under 200 in both innings, but Kohli top-scored in each. He made 44 in the first innings and 75 in the second before being caught behind off Peter Siddle.Rahul Dravid was the only other Indian batter to score more than 14 runs in the match, while seven players failed to reach double figures. After the Test, Kohli addressed the criticism in a press conference, saying: ""I don't know why people were even after me after the first game.""In the following Test, Kohli scored his maiden Test century. He again top-scored and batted with the tail to reach the hundred with one wicket remaining. That innings became the first of his 30 Test centuries, placing him fourth on India’s all-time list.That phase marked the beginning of Kohli’s long Test career, after he chose to ignore calls for his exclusion.","Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar has reacted to Virat Kohli's Test retirement.

Tyreek Hill vs Keeta Vaccaro: Court documents reveal custody dispute







Tyreek Hill and his ex-wife Keeta Vaccaro are once again at the center of a heated legal battle. The NFL star has filed new court documents alleging that Vaccaro is using her time with their daughter to try to reconcile and extract additional money from him. Hill’s filings highlight ongoing tension in the aftermath of their 17-month marriage, which ended amid serious allegations and legal disputes.According to the documents obtained by TMZ Sports, Hill is requesting that his grandmother replace Vaccaro as the designated adult during his scheduled timesharing with their daughter. He claims Vaccaro has repeatedly used these visits to discuss reconciliation and financial matters, which he says disrupts his ability to spend meaningful time with his child. Hill states that these actions interfere with his parenting and create uncomfortable situations during family time.In his court filings, Hill points to events from July 2025, when Vaccaro reportedly updated her divorce petition with claims he says were exaggerated. Hill says she has refused to step aside as the supervising parent during his times with their daughter. He stresses that his main concern is creating a calm, stable environment for their child, without discussions about reconciliation or money interfering.Vaccaro’s representatives strongly deny Hill’s claims. Attorney Evan R. Marks told TMZ Sports that the allegations are “simply untrue,” stressing that Vaccaro has no desire to reconcile with Hill. Marks added that she has filed eight separate tort claims alleging physical and emotional harm during the marriage and is awaiting a court ruling on temporary spousal support and child support. He also noted that Vaccaro has been cooperating with the NFL’s investigation into the domestic allegations.The situation has drawn additional scrutiny after a September domestic dispute prompted police involvement at the couple’s Miami-area home. Hill has denied all physical abuse claims. While the legal battle continues, Hill’s career has also taken a hit, as his 2025 NFL season ended early after he dislocated his knee in Week 4 against the New York Jets.Both Hill and Vaccaro are now waiting on court decisions regarding child support, spousal support, and other claims. A jury will eventually determine any damages. Their ongoing dispute highlights how complicated high-profile divorces can be, especially when parenting, finances, and public attention are all involved.Also Read: How many kids does Tyreek Hill have?

From 20 to 2 minutes: Hebbal flyover finally lets Bengaluru citizens breathe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/from-20-to-2-minutes-hebbal-flyover-finally-lets-bengaluru-citizens-breathe/articleshow/126380884.cms,"





Bengaluru: For years, Hebbal flyover was synonymous with bumper-to-bumper traffic — a daily trial of patience for thousands of motorists. Commuters approaching from Byataranapura–Kodigehalli–Esteem Mall side routinely spent 20 to 30 minutes crawling across one of Bengaluru's most infamous choke points. That reputation, however, is now a thing of the past!With the addition of two new traffic loops, travel experience atop the Hebbal flyover has turned almost unrecognisable. To gauge the impact on ground, The Times of India team undertook a test drive during the morning peak hour Tuesday. The result was nothing short of startling: A one-kilometre ride on two-wheeler on the service road from Esteem Mall to Hebbal traffic police station, with speeds varying between 40 and 60 kmph, was completed in just about 2 minutes 15 seconds.The bike ride started at 10.34am in front of Esteem Mall, got on the Tumakuru Road loop (the stretch where vehicles would take anywhere between 10-12 minutes to get on the flyover) and terminated before Baptist Hospital at 10.35am. With traffic from the airport carriage converging, vehicle flow slowed down near UAS campus bus stop and at CBI junction and further ahead at Ganganagar. The bike reached Mehkri Circle underpass at 10.47am and got stuck in traffic jam for three minutes.By 11.05am, the journey ended near Chinnaswamy stadium on MG Road, completing the journey in around 30 minutes!The enthusiasm among fellow motorists too was high. ""A few months ago, our car would crawl, we would pray for the traffic cop on Hebbal flyover to pause vehicles coming from airport-side and let us pass. But the scenario has changed, the flyover is no longer ‘Hebbal headache',"" said Roshni Ram, a marketing executive. Commuters feel the overall travel time can be reduced further if the fresh bottlenecks at Ganganagar and Mehkri Circle are addressed.Sumit Jain, a PR professional living in Hebbal, said: ""New snarls have cropped up from Baptist Hospital towards Mekhri Circle. At the loop's exit, a BMTC bus stop breaks the flow, and vehicles cutting across to the service road only make it worse. Time saved on the flyover is lost immediately after.""Yet, outside peak hours, the transformation is far more convincing. Hansika S, who commutes by bus from Jakkur to the city centre, said the difference is stark. ""Earlier, even during non-peak hours, it took 30 to 45 minutes by bus just to reach the Hebbal flyover exit. Now, I reach Baptist Hospital from Jakkur in about 15 minutes. Occasionally, I get delayed near Mehkri Circle for three to four minutes, but that barely feels like a hassle anymore. ""Deputy commissioner of police (traffic-north) Jayaprakash said before the opening of the loops, they deployed around 15-20 men on and near the flyover to control the traffic. ""Earlier, there was this gating action (stop and proceed) that created bottlenecks and slow movement of vehicles. Now, vehicles coming from the airport, Kodigehalli (Easteem Mall service road), and KR Pura move in different lanes, undisturbed, and therefore, there is no traffic jam,"" he said. Now, hardly five traffic police men are seen near the flyover.Quotes with mugshotsRoad users are elated...As an artist, I commute through Hebbal frequently for rehearsals and programmes. Over the past week, travelling on Hebbal flyover has been a pleasure. What used to be chaotic and stressful during peak hours has become a comfortable commute. I save at least 20 minutes every day now, and I truly appreciate the govt's efforts-- Anuradha Vikranth, dance artiste and resident of SahakarnagarWith the new loop, three conflict points - traffic coming from airport side, KR Pura side and Goraguntepalya side have all reduced. Another loop that's being planned by the BDA from KR Pura towards the airport will also reduce the traffic. What is required now is pedestrian crossings as many walk under the flyover and cross those roads to catch buses to different parts of the city-- K B Rathnakara Reddy, infrastructure engineer and transportation expert.The loop is a temporary solution, it has definitely offered some relief to all those who travel from Manyata Tech Park towards Mehkri Circle. It would have been good if the up ramp on the ORR is widened further. The main challenge for motorists is not Hebbal flyover but the ongoing Metro construction-- Sunder Nileshwar, tech professional, Manyata Tech ParkTraffic was smoother in the first few days after the inauguration because of the New Year holidays. However, once offices and schools reopened, there are more vehicles. But it is still better than earlier when we would wait endlessly for the traffic ahead of us to move. Widening the road up to CBI or Mehkri Circle would help ease the situation further--- Santosh Sapate, regular commuterI have been using the Hebbal flyover for over 25 years to commute to my office on Residency Road. After the airport opened, traffic jams here became unbearable. Earlier, it took 30–35 minutes just to reach the flyover entry from Esteem Mall. Now, that stretch takes only a few minutes, and exiting the flyover is smooth. My daily commute has become much easier— Devaraj Gowda, Amruthahalli RWA memberAs a food delivery partner, I cross the Hebbal flyover several times a day. Earlier, it took nearly 50 minutes to travel from Sahakarnagar to RT Nagar due to traffic jams near the flyover. Since the new loop opened, the same trip takes just 15 minutes. Even during peak hours, traffic moves smoothly, and my customers are happier too— Ravi Kiran, food delivery partner-----------------------------------------------What traffic police chief said...With both the loops (from KR Pura and Kodigehalli directions) opened, traffic moves unabated at the Hebbal junction. This has brought down the congestion level significantly. In fact, vehicle movement on the flyover does not come to a halt now, it moves. Earlier, we followed the stop-and-proceed method for vehicles passing through the flyover (when vehicles in one lane were allowed, movement would be stopped on two other lanes. ) But now, all the three lanes (the flyover lane and the 2 loops) are open to vehicles. Driving or riding on these lanes and loops gives a feeling of travelling in a signal-free corridor for motorists-- Karthik Reddy, Joint commissioner of police (traffic)","Hebbal flyover was synonymous with bumper-to-bumper traffic for years.

Donovan Mitchell’s status vs Indiana Pacers (January 6, 2026)

Why Cleveland Cavaliers picked this game

Cleveland Cavaliers’ injury report goes beyond Donovan Mitchell

Indiana is shorthanded as well





when the Cleveland Cavaliers face the Indiana Pacers at Gainbridge Fieldhouse. Cleveland has ruled him out for rest on the January 6 injury report, and there is no injury involved in the decision.This was a planned night off. Mitchell has been carrying a heavy load all season and is coming off a 30-point performance in a loss to Detroit. The Cavaliers made the call early, and there was never any expectation that his status might change closer to tip-off.Donovan Mitchell is listed as out with “rest” as the only note. There is no new issue and no lingering concern from recent games. Cleveland has leaned on him for nearly 30 points a night while asking him to handle a large share of the offense. With the season still long and the team hovering just above .500, the Cavs chose to protect their top scorer rather than push him through another road game.The Cleveland Cavaliers sit at 20-17 and are already close to last season’s loss total. Managing Mitchell’s workload has become a priority, especially with playoff positioning still in flux. Indiana’s current situation made this an easier spot to rest him, even if Cleveland understands there are no automatic wins in the league.The decision reflects long-term thinking more than anything related to this single matchup.Mitchell is not the only question mark for Cleveland Cavaliers. Jarrett Allen is questionable with an illness and will be evaluated closer to game time. Dean Wade is also questionable due to a left knee contusion, which could further thin the frontcourt. Max Strus remains out as he continues to recover from left foot surgery, and Larry Nance Jr. is sidelined with a right calf injury.Those absences leave Cleveland with less margin for error, especially on the road.The Pacers are dealing with a long injury list of their own. Tyrese Haliburton is out for the season with a right Achilles tear. Bennedict Mathurin is sidelined with a right thumb sprain. Isaiah Jackson remains out with a concussion, and Obi Toppin is unavailable due to a right foot stress fracture. The injuries have stripped Indiana of ball-handling, scoring, and depth.How the game shifts without MitchellWithout Mitchell, Cleveland’s offense becomes more dependent on Darius Garland to create shots and control tempo. Evan Mobley is expected to see more touches as a scorer and facilitator. Shooters like Sam Merrill and wings such as Jaylon Tyson will need to knock down open looks to keep the floor spaced.For Indiana, Mitchell’s absence offers a small opening during a 12-game losing streak. Still, the Pacers’ own injuries mean they will rely heavily on Pascal Siakam and a limited supporting cast to produce enough offense against a Cleveland defense that remains solid even without its top scorer.Also read: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Indiana Pacers regular season game injury report: Who's out, key players, where to watch, and more (January 6, 2026) This game loses its biggest name, but it puts the focus squarely on execution and depth on both sides.",Donovan Mitchell is listed as out with “rest” as the only note.

Usman Khawaja's retirement speech: 'I want the journey for the next Usman Khawaja to be easier'

- Full-time job? -





LONDON: Manchester United interim boss Darren Fletcher said Tuesday that leading the club was beyond his ""wildest dreams"" but insisted he has not considered replacing the sacked Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese manager was axed on Monday after a turbulent 14 months at Old Trafford, with former United midfielder Fletcher put in temporary charge.The under-18s coach faced the press for the first time on the eve of his team's match at Burnley.""It's surreal,"" said Fletcher, who made 342 appearances for the Red Devils and has worked in a variety of different roles for them since 2020, including as technical director.""It's an amazing honour to be able to lead a Manchester United team,"" he said. ""I don't even think it was in my wildest dreams that that was something that could potentially happen, even thinking about playing for the club and stuff like that.""But to lead out the team is an amazing honour and something I am really proud to do.""It's not (happened) in the circumstances that I expected it to happen so that obviously is something that doesn't sit quite easy with me, but I just have to think I've got a job to do and I've got to lead the team tomorrow and think of the great honour and pride in doing that.""The former Scotland international is expected to remain in place until the club appoints a caretaker boss, with United planning to name Amorim's permanent successor at the end of the season.The BBC reported that the club had held preliminary talks with Fletcher, Michael Carrick and former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, all ex-United players, about the position of caretaker.But Fletcher, 41, said at his pre-match press conference that conversations with United's hierarchy had focused on Wednesday's game and they would talk again after the match.Fletcher was asked whether he wanted to try to earn the manager's job on a full-time basis.""Honestly it's not something I've thought about,"" he said. ""I'm focusing on Burnley. I think that discussion is for after the game.""There has been that much going on and it has all happened so quickly that all my concentration, efforts and thoughts have gone into Burnley.""Fletcher won five Premier League titles under the management of Alex Ferguson but the club have not been English champions since 2013.""Everyone expects Manchester United to be on the top and winning, that's the standard, that's what we all have to try and achieve,"" said a bullish Fletcher.He was asked what his United team would look like.""Hopefully it looks like a Manchester United team that represents a bit of me, I think in terms of what I know is Manchester United,"" he said.""So I hope it resembles a Manchester United team that fans can be proud of, that I can be proud of, and I'm sure they will because I believe in the players.""I think we've got good players and I think we've got players who care and I think we've got a lot of quality in that team and I hope to give them a platform to go out there to express themselves.""Fletcher said he hoped to welcome back captain Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount into a squad badly depleted by injuries and international commitments.He joked that he refused to disclose sensitive information when asked whether his twin sons, Jack and Tyler, would be given full debuts against Burnley.United are sixth in the Premier League table, three points behind fourth-placed Liverpool.","Darren Fletcher says leading Manchester United is beyond his ""wildest dreams"" Fletcher is in temporary charge after the sacking of Ruben Amorim on Monday.

Poll Do you think Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma should participate in the 2027 ODI World Cup? Yes, they are still in great form No, it's time for new players





MUMBAI: It seems that even the international cricketers community is keen that modern-day legends Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , currently in blazing form, go on and play in the 2027 ODI World Cup in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia seems to be settled.Set to lead the New Zealand ODI team for a three-match series in India which starts at Vadodara from Jan 11, New Zealand captain Michael Bracewell was forthright when quizzed about whether he sees the classy but ageing pair in the mega event, which is still 22 months from now.""I'd like to see them play in the World Cup. They're obviously still playing very good cricket so there's no reason to stop. They're both playing beautifully, so why not? Their records speak for themselves, both individually and as a team. They've been involved in some great Indian sides and led that side with the bat. You'd be silly to underestimate them, that's for sure,"" Bracewell said here on Tuesday at the Willingdon Sports Club here, where NZC, in partnership with TCM Sports, hosted an exclusive New Zealand Cricket Golf Day.The ODI series will be followed by the five-match T20I series from Jan 21.Bracewell said that the Black Caps relished coming to India due to the passion of the sport in this part of the world and the top quality of the home side. ""Every time we come to India, there's always amazing crowds here and one thing that stands out for me is just the love of cricket. I find that when we're doing well we still get supported, which is a bit of a rarity when you go to some (other) places in the world. It's always a pleasure to come here and play cricket and test ourselves against some of the best players in the world,"" said the 34-year-old allrounder, who has played just 40 ODIs.He pointed out that the Kiwis also love the challenge of playing on some different surfaces that they encounter in India, even in a white-ball series.The Kiwis last toured India for a white-ball series in Jan-Feb 2023. They were blanked 3-0 in the ODIs and 3-1 in the T20Is. ""You get a varied degree of surfaces here. I remember, we toured here not long ago and played on a very turning wicket in Lucknow (NZ made 99-8 in 20 overs on a poor surface (in the second T20I) there, lost that match by six wickets), and then played on some more favourable wickets in different places. I think you get a wide variety of pitches, and it's a good test of you as a player to be able to play in all different conditions and that's one of the great things of international cricket. You get to play on some tough pitches for batting and then some more favourable ones as well,"" Bracewell said.One big name the Black Caps will miss in their ODI line-up for this tour is left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner, who has often troubled India's best batters, particularly Kohli, during their previous white-ball tour of India. Santner will arrive later as the captain of the New Zealand T20I side. ""It's a tricky one! Whenever you're missing players of, say, Mitch’s calibre, you're always going to be struggling to replace them so you're asking guys to come in and do their role as best as they can. You're never going to be able to replace a guy like that. But if everyone mucks in and does their little bit, then hopefully we can all work together and achieve great things on this tour,"" said Bracewell.An ODI series before the T20 World Cup, starting in India and Sri Lanka from Feb 7, tends to lose lustre, but the Black Caps are focused on putting their best foot forward in it. ""You have to be where your feet are and take care of what's in front of you. We've obviously got an important one-day series coming up against India. It's going to be a huge challenge for us, but one we're really excited for. One-day cricket has a lot of different skill sets involved in it. You have to be able to bat for long periods of time and then apply pressure. So I think there's a great skill set there that you can use whatever format that you're playing, one-day cricket is a true test of your skill as a player,"" said Bracewell.",Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma could play in the 2027 ODI World Cup. New Zealand captain Michael Bracewell says the pair are still in great form. The Kiwis are in India for a three-match ODI series starting on Jan 11. The series will be followed by a five-match T20I series.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126386739,imgsize-165982,width-400,resizemode-4/michael-bracewell.jpg"

Lenny Dykstra Charged With Drug and Paraphernalia Possession in Pike County





Lenny Dykstra, the 62-year-old former Major League Baseball star, has been formally charged with misdemeanor possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia after a traffic stop in Pike County, Pennsylvania, just after midnight on January 1, 2026. The Pennsylvania State Police said the retired Phillies and Mets outfielder was a passenger in a truck stopped for a vehicle code violation when officers found narcotics and related equipment in his possession.Lenny Dykstra was not taken into custody at the scene, and police did not say what kind of drugs were allegedly involved. His lawyer, Matthew Blit, said in a statement that Dykstra did not own the vehicle and was not under the influence at the time of the stop. Blit added that any charges against Dykstra will be cleared in court.According to police, the traffic stop happened just after midnight on New Year’s Day, around Route 507 in Greene Township, near where Dykstra lives in Scranton, Pennsylvania.State troopers pulled over the 2015 GMC Sierra truck because of a motor vehicle code violation and asked for identification.The police report says that when Dykstra opened a pouch in the glove compartment to show his ID, officers saw a jar with suspected crack cocaine or methamphetamine and a glass smoking device with what appeared to be drug residue.The substances were not tested at the scene, but officers determined they were suspected narcotics and paraphernalia.Lenny Dykstra was given a summons and will have a preliminary hearing on February 3, 2026, in Pike County court. Lawyers for Dykstra have already said they expect the case to be resolved in his favor.Lenny Dykstra’s attorney, Matthew Blit, told reporters that Dykstra was simply a passenger and that the vehicle was not his.Blit stressed that his client was not accused of being under the influence of any substance at the time of the stop and that charges will be cleared quickly.Lenny Dykstra played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball, starting with the New York Mets and then spending several years with the Philadelphia Phillies before retiring after the 1996 season.He was part of the Mets team that won the 1986 World Series and was known for his hard-nosed playing style. Since retiring from baseball, Dykstra has faced several legal and financial problems.He served time in federal prison for bankruptcy fraud and grand theft auto, and he has been charged in the past with drug possession and other offenses, although some were dropped or resolved.Dykstra’s past issues and this latest charge continue a long history of trouble off the field.Police and court officials have not yet released full details of the evidence or the case, but Dykstra’s lawyer remains confident the charges will not stick.Also Read: Who Is Trey Yesavage’s Fiancée?
