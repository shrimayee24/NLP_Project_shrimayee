Bihar Exit Polls 2025: Poll of Polls Show NDA Poised For Majority, MGB Trails, No Impact of JSP

Exit polls have had a patchy record in India



Exit polls released Tuesday were unanimous that NDA will win Bihar and do so with a much more comfortable majority than five years ago. Some even projected that it could get close to a two-thirds majority in the 243-member assembly.The polls also concurred that Prashant Kishor's fledgling outfit, Jan Suraaj, will have at best a limited impact, at least in terms of winning assembly seats.If the exit polls prove correct, chief minister Nitish Kumar would have shown that a near 20-year run in the job with a brief 9-month gap has not rubbed the sheen off his popularity, a remarkable feat by any standards. It would also mean a significant booster for NDA, heading into crucial assembly polls next year.Dainik Bhaskar projected that NDA would win between 145 and 160 seats with the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan trailing way behind at 73-102 and ""others"" winning between five and 10 seats.The Matrize-IANS poll had very similar numbers with the NDA projected to win 147-167, the MGB 70-90 and others two to six seats. People's Pulse had only slightly different projections with the NDA slated to win 135-159, the MGB 75-101 and others two to eight seats.The majority mark in the Bihar assembly is 122 while 162 represents the two-third mark. That mark has been achieved by the winning coalition twice in the last two decades. The NDA in 2010 won 206 seats while the Mahagathbandhan in 2015 - which included RJD, JD(U) and Congress - won 178 seats. In 2020, the NDA won 125 seats while the MGB won 110.Exit polls have had a patchy record in India with some spectacular successes interspersed with projections that have been way off the mark. Two major pollsters - Axis My India and Today's Chanakya - are to reveal their projections on Wednesday. The results will be known Friday.","Exit polls released Tuesday were unanimous that NDA will win Bihar and do so with a comfortable majority.

Since then, she and her husband, Santosh Bhagat (43), had been quarrelling frequently, neighbours said.Soon after the call got disconnected, the shocked daughter and her husband dialled their relatives and rushed to Bhinjpur on November 10 to find a stroller containing Bhagat's body wrapped in a blanket. Bhagat's elder brother informed police, Jashpur SP Shashimohan Singh said.Police booked Mangrita under BNS Section 103(1) (murder) and launched a search for her. A team was also dispatched to Maharashtra to trace her. Cops suspect Bhagat died of bleeding from the nose and mouth.The body was sent for autopsy, and the preliminary post-mortem report indicated a fatal blow to the temple inflicted with a sharp-edged weapon, officials said.According to the FIR, the couple had an argument on November 7. Neighbours said the dispute spilled over to next day, and Bhagat was likely murdered on the night of November 8.","40-year-old woman allegedly confessed to killing her husband over the phone.

1,592 poll booths located in Maoist-hit areas, none of them shifted this time

PATNA: Bihar set a new record on Tuesday with a polling percentage of 68.8 in the second and final phase, leaving political parties in a state of nervous excitement. The overall voting for both phases stood at 66.9%, the highest overall turnout since 1951. In the 2020 assembly polls, the turnout was 57.3% over three phases.While the opposition has termed it a mandate against NDA, the governing alliance sees it as a vote of confidence in the Nitish Kumar-led double-engine govt. Scenes of polling officials being greeted with garlands and drumbeats dominated areas that were once under the grip of Maoist violence, with long queues from early morning surprising EC officials. While 62.8% male voters participated in the polling, the turnout among female voters was recorded at 71.6%. According to EC, the previous highest turnout in the state was 64.6%, recorded during the 1998 LS polls, while in assembly polls, it was 62.6% in 2000.The Bihar Legislative Assembly elections concluded with a historic highest-ever voter turnout of 66.9%. This is the highest voter turnout recorded in the state since 1951,"" chief electoral officer (CEO) Vinod Singh Gunjiyal told a media conference on Tuesday evening.Contrary to speculations that the heightened security and rigorous checks following the Delhi terror blast on Monday evening could impact voting, the polling percentage remarkably shot up in 122 assembly seats in 20 districts that went to polls in the second phase. Muslim-domianted Seemanchal region comprising four districts of Kishanganj, Purnia, Katihar and Araria saw highest voting. ""The second phase of polling passed off peacefully, as no incident of violence was reported from anywhere,"" Gunjiyal said, adding that all the vehicles and boats carrying EVMs were fitted with GPS systems to track their movement.A total of 1,592 booths were located in the Maoist-affected areas, and none of them had to be shifted this time. In a proud moment for Chormara village in Barhat block of once Naxal-hit Jamui district, a team of polling personnel was accorded a grand welcome with rhythmic drum beats, traditional folk songs and garlands of marigold flowers. The festive mood lingered, with streets buzzing with excitement and anticipation throughout the day. In the same district, the wife of a surrendered Maoist commander, Arjun Koda, reached a polling booth to cast her vote and also posed for photographs.The polling was marked by vibrant scenes adding colour to the festival of democracy. At Amuar booth in Supaul district, a patient fitted with an oxygen cylinder came in an e-rickshaw to exercise his franchise.

Printing press staffer had just gone back to work after Diwali at home



Monday's blast claimed the lives of many ordinary folks who had come from different corners of the country, drawn by Delhi's promise of work that paid, of days that ran on time, of futures that could be planned one bill at a time.Two friends, Ashok Kumar , 34, and Lokesh Agarwal, 52, had met after months apart. Lokesh was in Delhi to see an ailing relative. And Ashok, a DTC driver, insisted on spending a few minutes together before heading home. Perhaps they talked about families. Who knows. By dawn, their bodies were back in Amroha (UP), shrouded in white.Then there was Mohsin, 32, who was finishing his evening round through Old Delhi, his e-rickshaw weaving between vendors and buses. He drove long hours to keep his two children in school. The rickshaw was found crumpled in the debris. Young Noman Ansari, 22, had come from Shamli that morning, hoping to buy cosmetics for his shop. He carried a list in his wallet. His brother survived the blast; he didn't.There were others, too. Dinesh Mishra, 32, had returned to Delhi after Diwali, leaving behind his daughters in UP's Shravasti. He worked at a printing press.Pankaj Sahni, 22, a cabbie from Bihar, was waiting at a red light after a routine drop-off when the car in front of him exploded.Delhi man Amar Kataria, 33, a pharmacist, had called his father to say he was on his way for dinner. His phone was later found in the rubble. Mohammad Jumman, 35, an e-rickshaw driver from Shastri Park in the capital city, was driving home to his family when his location froze on his brother's screen - a blinking dot that never moved again.Dinesh Kumar Mishra (32), printing press worker | Native of Shravasti, Uttar PradeshTen days ago, Dinesh had travelled from Delhi to his village Ganeshpur in UP's Shravasti to celebrate Diwali. He spent the afternoon decorating the mud walls of his home with his daughters, Bitta, 7, and Srishti, 4, before joining the evening prayers. His eldest son, Himanshu, 8, clung to his hand, reluctant to let go when it was time for him to leave. ""I'll be back soon,"" Dinesh had said. ""Just after the next order.""He worked at a printing press in Chandni Chowk, earning enough to send money home every few weeks. The work was hard but steady, and Delhi had begun to feel familiar - a rented room near the press, tea from the same stall each morning.His wife Reena Devi stayed back in Ganeshpur with the children, while his brothers Guddu and Rajesh worked as labourers elsewhere in Delhi. His father, Bhure Mishra, a farmer, called every Sunday to ask if he was eating well. ""He always said the same thing,"" Bhure recalled later. ""Bas kuch din ki baat hai - just a matter of a few days.""On Monday evening, the blast near Red Fort ripped through that small certainty. For hours, the family tried calling. When no one answered, Guddu rode his motorcycle through the city's chaos toward Chandni Chowk. He was the one who found Dinesh at LNJP Hospital. ""I want to appeal to the PM to help us,"" said Bhure. ""Whatever we receive, it will go to the children.""Villagers gathered outside the Mishra home, some holding small lamps left over from Diwali. Inside, Reena sat on the floor, her hands motionless in her lap. ""He called every night,"" she whispered.

Klay Thompson apologizes to Megan Thee Stallion after airport mishap





Megan Thee Stallion on her relationship with Klay Thompson





Klay Thompson might be known for his calm demeanor on the court, but off it, the Dallas Mavericks star recently showed his softer side. After arriving late to pick up his girlfriend, rapper Megan Thee Stallion , from the airport, Thompson went viral for his heartfelt apology and his remorse. The clip, shared by Megan on social media, captured the NBA star trying to make amends with flowers in hand and genuine regret on his face.The moment quickly became a talking point among fans, who couldn’t get enough of the couple’s chemistry and Thompson’s down-to-earth approach. It also comes at a time when both are thriving in their respective careers, with Thompson beginning his new season in Dallas and Megan releasing new music inspired by their relationship.In the video posted online, Klay Thompson can be seen handing Megan a bouquet while apologizing repeatedly for showing up late. “Roses for my boo,” he said while driving her home. “I’m sorry I was late, babe. Damn it. I’m sorry. I thought I timed it well. Ah, just sorry. There’s no excuse.”Fans immediately flooded social media with amused and affectionate reactions, praising Thompson’s gesture as “adorably human.” The incident added another viral moment to their growing list of public appearances since confirming their romance earlier this year.Over the summer, the couple enjoyed a fishing trip that gave fans a glimpse into their playful dynamic. “So today, Klay is taking me on another adventure and we’re going fishing,” Megan said at the time. Thompson responded lovingly: “I got my queen on board, of course I feel cool. I’m the coolest guy in this harbor!”For Megan, whose real name is Megan Jovon Ruth Pete, the relationship marks a new chapter. “This is my first relationship where I’ve ever been with somebody who’s genuinely a nice person, and he makes me genuinely happy,” she told Page Six.“I just never dated somebody like him before and I’m just grateful that he’s here by my side and he feels the same way about me.”Despite occasional public skepticism — even from personalities like Shaquille O’Neal, who jokingly doubted their relationship on The Big Podcast — fans have embraced the pair’s authenticity. O’Neal later called Megan “athletic, so beautiful, and so gorgeous,” insisting his remarks were lighthearted.For now, Thompson and Megan seem unfazed by outside opinions. Their recent viral moment only serves to extend a genuine connection between two stars from different worlds. The duo has been very active on social media to share their personal moments of joy and love. Megan has over 32.7 million followers on Instagram, while Thomson has 16.8 million fans on the platform.Stallion is fully embracing her lover girl era — and fans are loving it. The three-time Grammy winner took to Instagram to tease a behind-the-scenes look at her new single “Lover Girl,” a song she openly admits is inspired by her boyfriend, NBA star Klay Thompson.“This is my song about Klay,” Megan said in the clip with a shy smile. “First n**** in life that has ever gotten a song outta me.” Fans quickly flooded the comments, cheering for the rapper’s happiness and her growing romance with the four-time NBA champion.Listeners have already picked up on the deeper meaning behind “Lover Girl.” In the track, Megan raps about finding someone who truly matches her energy and confidence. “Ayy, your n**** fantasy, my man reality,” she spits, celebrating a relationship built on mutual respect and balance.The lyrics hint at a future together too, with lines about “making big moves” which is a nod to the couple’s rumored move-in together.Also Read: NBA’s highly anticipated Europe-based league’s potential release date revealed","Klay Thompson arrived late to pick up his girlfriend, rapper Megan Thee Stallion, from the airport.

Stephen Curry’s uncertain return keeps the Golden State Warriors fans on edge ahead of Oklahoma City Thunder clash

The Golden State Warriors fans are kind of anxious for tonight's match with the Oklahoma City Thunder. Their main player, Stephen Curry, who was suffering from an illness, was still listed as a probable player in the last game and thus was a concern for the fans.Having just returned from his injury, Curry missed his third consecutive game and the Warriors’ game against the Indiana Pacers due to illness. This happened due to Curry's lingering cold, after returning from an injury. His return may prove to be one of those defining moments at the beginning of the 2025–26 NBA season, as the team currently sits at an even record of 5–5.The Golden State Warriors have been struggling a lot during the time Curry was not there. They have lost their character, the offense has dropped to the lowest point, and even the defense has not been so dependable. A healthy Curry in the lineup could be the one thing this team needs. The coach Steve Kerr was also anxious due to Curry's health.However, thankfully, Steph Curry does not have a serious injury. The 37-year-old's ""lingering cold"" which has ruled him out for three consecutive games does not appear to be gone yet as winter is fast approaching in the US.He is therefore returning for the Oklahoma City Thunders game on November 12.Nevertheless, he had to miss back-to-back games against the Sacramento Kings and Denver Nuggets due to an unexpected illness. According to reports, his health got worse before those games, thus the Warriors' medical staff decided to put his complete recovery ahead of a hasty return.On November 10, the Golden State Warriors made the official announcement of Curry's injury. During Curry's absence, Draymond Green and Brandin Podziemski were the leading players of the Warriors' offense. Despite the fact that the star player of the Warriors has already missed a great deal of time this season, the announcement was still a huge disappointment for both the management and fans alike.Hence, the Warriors had tagged him as questionable heading into the previous match. However, when news broke a couple hours ahead of the game that Curry would miss the match against the Pacers, dreams were shattered.So far, the Golden State Warriors have had Stephen Curry on the court in 8 games during the 2025-26 NBA season, where he has been getting 31.1 minutes on average. However, he has scored a total of 26.8 points per game for the Warriors during this period of time.

How Michael Irvin discovered his wife’s early-onset Alzheimer’s

“We recognized some things were going wrong with her about ten years ago… We thought it was menopause… We buried my mom. She had Alzheimer’s. My mother-in-law was living with us because she had Alzheimer’s. And now we thought my wife was going through menopause at 49 because she’s coming at 50.”

Michael Irvin On Wife Having Alzheimer's In Her 50s | CLUB SHAY SHAY

“It’s quite hard to take care of someone 24 hours a day… I have to keep a 24-hour nurse with her all the time.”

“If anyone has earned the right to stay in her house, MY WIFE HAS!!! … That I shall honour. No matter what it takes.”

Being a football legend is one thing, but facing life’s toughest plays off the field is a whole different ballgame. Michael Irvin , the iconic Dallas Cowboys wide receiver, has opened up about one of the most personal challenges of his life, his wife Sandy Harrell (née Irvin) has been diagnosed with very early-onset Alzheimer’s disease.Irvin, known for his unforgettable catches and fiery personality on the field, revealed that his wife’s symptoms first appeared around 8–10 years ago. At the time, they thought it might be normal aging or menopause but it soon became clear that something more serious was happening and it needed attention. His emotional revelation gives fans a glimpse of the human side of a public figure often celebrated for his athletic prowess.Talking candidly, Irvin shared:This initial uncertainty highlights how subtle the early signs ofcan be especially in someone so young. Very early-onset Alzheimer’s (diagnosed under 65) is rare, and Irvin’s story shows the complex emotions families face when symptoms first appear.Irvin didn’t shy away from describing the realities of caring for his wife:Balancing the responsibilities of caregiving with his public life has been a profound challenge. Yet, Irvin’s dedication never wavered. He emphasizes the emotional labor behind every decision, reflecting a side of him fans rarely see, the deep and unwavering devotion of a husband navigating one of life’s hardest battles.For Irvin, the focus has always been on Sandy’s comfort and dignity. He explained :Rather than placing her in a facility, the couple relies on a live-in caregiver to ensure Sandy remains in the home they built together. This choice underscores both love and respect, showing that Irvin’s heroics aren’t just on the football field they’re at home, too.Michael Irvin’s story is a reminder that real strength often comes in quiet, daily acts of love and care. Through sleepless nights, emotional trials, and public attention, he stands by Sandy, determined to honor her wishes and protect her dignity. His devotion paints a powerful picture of resilience, showing that heroism isn’t always loud or celebrated. Sometimes, it’s found in quiet loyalty, unwavering faith, and the courage to love without limits.Also read - “The plot of a rom-com”: Madison Beer and Justin Herbert’s Lakers date goes viral after his heroic move melts the internet",Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin has opened up about one of the most personal challenges of his life.

Matt Hardy on Vince McMahon’s child-focused WWE strategy



Ranking The Hardy Boyz BEST Years in Wrestling

Rising ticket prices and attendance challenges



WWE legend Matt Hardy has recently opened up about former WWE chairman Vince McMahon ’s strategic approach, highlighting how the wrestling icon targeted younger audiences to grow the promotion. Speaking on his podcast, The Extreme Life of Matt Hardy, the former tag team star reflected on WWE’s evolution after the Attitude Era, when the company shifted to a more family-friendly, PG-rated format. Hardy emphasized that McMahon’s decisions were not just about entertainment— they were calculated moves to attract children and, by extension, entire families to live events.Hardy also touched on recent concerns about ticket prices and WWE’s declining attendance. He argued that affordability was a core aspect of McMahon’s philosophy, pointing out that attracting families meant balancing pricing while maintaining a product that remained engaging for all ages. The conversation reveals the ongoing debate around WWE’s business model in the post-McMahon era.Matt Hardy explained that Vince McMahon deliberately aimed to make WWE appealing for younger fans. “I feel like Vince was out there to try and bring families in. That was his whole thing, especially once he changed it after the Attitude Era, when society kind of changed a little bit too. It wasn’t quite as wild west once we started getting into the 2000s and the whole PG era,” Hardy shared.“He was adamant, man. He really wanted to appeal to children because he knows if there are children who get hooked on the product, they’re going to come, and their parents obviously have to come with them. They can’t just let their little kids go to this all by themselves, you know, so the whole family has to cash in and buy tickets. He was adamant about doing that and attracting families, but also he did try and make it as affordable as he possibly could. I think he was cognizant of that fact.”Hardy’s comments underline how WWE’s business model under McMahon relied on cultivating the next generation of fans. By ensuring the product was safe and engaging for children, McMahon not only boosted attendance but created long-term brand loyalty, a strategy that shaped WWE’s programming for decades.Hardy also weighed in on WWE’s current challenges, citing high ticket prices and the absence of marquee stars like John Cena as contributing factors to declining attendance. “If you are going to charge those top-level prices, you have to make sure your product is top-level at all times and is white hot,” Hardy noted.Data from Wrestlenomics supports these concerns, showing that average ticket prices have nearly doubled since WWE’s merger with TKO Group Holdings in 2023. Events like the October 31 SmackDown in Salt Lake City distributed just over 4,200 tickets, compared to nearly 7,900 for a premium event in the same arena two days later.Also Read: ""It rocked me"" – Dwayne Johnson shares candid details on battling depression after divorce with Dany Garcia","WWE legend Matt Hardy has opened up about former WWE chairman Vince McMahon ’s strategic approach.

More NFL coverage

Things are looking frosty in the Belichick family these days. During North Carolina’s tight 20–15 win over Stanford on Saturday, head coach Bill Belichick’s girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, and his daughter-in-law, Jennifer Schmitt, appeared to keep their distance. The two women attended the game at Chapel Hill but reportedly avoided each other entirely — a scene that didn’t go unnoticed by fans and cameras alike. While Belichick focused on leading his Tar Heels, the off-field drama between Hudson and Schmitt quietly took center stage.Jordon, 24, was seen standing with folded arms in a white tank top and a blue reptile miniskirt, while Jennifer matched the team colors in a white crop top and blue shorts. The chilly atmosphere between them follows their very public online feud earlier this year.The tension dates back months when Jennifer, who’s married to Bill Belichick’s son Stephen, took a jab at Hudson’s behavior during Bill’s interview with CBS' Tony Dokoupil. Jennifer wrote, “Publicists act in a professional manner, and don’t 'storm' off set delaying an interview” — a pointed comment aimed squarely at Jordon.The young model had stepped in during that interview, prompting Bill to later defend her, saying she only intervened after he repeatedly told CBS Mornings producers he wanted to discuss his book, “The Art Of Winning: Lessons from My Life in Football. ”Since then, Jordon Hudson’s presence around UNC football has sparked constant headlines. Despite the Tar Heels’ 4–5 record, her game-day appearances continue to draw more attention than the team’s performance. At Saturday’s game, it was her outfit — especially a necklace featuring one word that seemed to reference her rumored “ban” from UNC facilities — that caught fans’ eyes.Back in May, rumors swirled that Hudson had been banned from team grounds, though the school denied them. Still, her choice of jewelry seemed like a subtle, perhaps petty, response to those claims. Standing on the sideline in stylish white boots, Hudson appeared unbothered and intent on making her presence felt.For now, the Tar Heels are finding their rhythm with two straight wins and another test coming against Wake Forest. But even as Bill Belichick brings his winning touch to Chapel Hill, it’s clear that the family drama off the field isn’t cooling down anytime soon.","Bill Belichick’s girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, and his daughter-in-law, Jennifer Schmitt, appeared to keep their distance.

Remembering Marshawn Kneeland: Family and friends honor his life beyond the game

Tributes to Marshawn Kneeland continue from Dallas Stars, NFL and other sports figures

More coverage in NFL:

The NFL world is mourning the heartbreaking loss of Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland, who passed away at just 24. A rising star known for his relentless energy and bright smile, Kneeland’s sudden death has left a deep void across the football community. Beyond his growing success on the field, he was loved for his humility, warmth, and the quiet strength that defined him as both a player and a person.His passing came just days after a standout performance against the Arizona Cardinals, where he scored his first NFL touchdown on a blocked punt recovery. The moment captured his talent and determination, yet behind that triumph was a young man silently struggling. His tragic death has reignited an urgent conversation across professional sports about mental health and the emotional toll of life in the spotlight.Those closest to Kneeland describe him as more than just a football player, he was a gentle soul who carried warmth and humility into every room. His grandmother affectionately called him her “baby giant,” a nickname that beautifully captured the contrast between his imposing size and his tender heart.His cousin, Nicole Kneeland-Woods, shared an emotional reflection on the kind of person he was. “He was physically a big guy, but he was the most kindhearted, caring, just generous, loving person that you'd ever meet,” she told ESPN.“We always knew he was going to be something because he was different, focused. He knew what he wanted.”Kneeland faced unimaginable personal loss before reaching his dream, losing both his grandfather and his mother within a short span. Yet those who knew him say he carried himself with quiet strength, using their memories as motivation rather than despair. His family believes that resilience defined him as much as his athletic talent.Kneeland’s agent, Jon Perzley, was among the last people to speak to him. Perzley told ESPN that Kneeland had been in good spirits during their final conversation, focused on improving and continuing to grow as a player. He declined to share further details of their last exchange because of the ongoing investigation but confirmed that Kneeland told him he loved him.“He just had this charm about him that was so pure and honest. I don't think there's a person who crossed paths with him who had a bad thing to say,” Perzley said. “On the outside you go, he checks every box that exists, and so I think that's why it's really hard for people right now. It's hard to understand it. Really hard.”From Dallas to Western Michigan, Kneeland’s teammates shared stories that reflect his lasting impact. Andre Carter, who played alongside him in college, called Kneeland’s energy “infectious.” He said, It's an understatement to say how great his energy [was] and just how much he was needed in that room.”Western Michigan defensive lineman Hozey Haji-Badri, one of Kneeland’s closest friends, said he leaned on him for support after transferring from East Carolina. Kneeland picked him up before practice and took him out to eat afterward, helping him settle into the team. “He really got me acclimated,” Haji-Badri said. “And for that, I’ll never forget.” The two bonded over their shared love of food, from barbecue to Thai, and built a friendship that went far beyond football.Kneeland’s passing is a devastating reminder that success on the field doesn’t always reflect what’s happening inside. His life and untimely death have become a powerful call for empathy and mental health awareness across professional sports. The Dallas Cowboys organization, his teammates, and fans across the country continue to honor his memory, not just as a talented player, but as a compassionate young man who left an indelible mark on everyone who knew him. Marshawn Kneeland’s legacy will live on as a reminder of resilience, kindness, and the importance of reaching out before it’s too late.","Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland passed away at just 24.

Yet what has everyone talking is her choice of caddie, teammate Sophie Cunningham, who plans to bring more laughter than golf expertise.Cunningham, known for her competitive edge and bold humor, made it clear that she is taking her new role lightly.

Even so, her energy and humor guarantee that this pairing will be one of the most entertaining of the tournament.During a recent episode of her Show Me Something podcast, Sophie Cunningham revealed her unconventional approach to caddying. “Hopefully they’re not too serious, because I’ll get kicked out of the group,” she said with a laugh.When co-host West Wilson reminded her that her job as a caddie is to keep the mood light, she replied, “Yeah, and I also found out that I don’t have to carry any [golf] bags.So I’m gonna be carrying a lot of beers.”When Wilson joked about rowdy spectators at the event, Cunningham quickly fired back, “Well, there will be a drunk female yelling back at them. Me.” That remark summed up her entire attitude toward the day ahead. She may not know every golf term, but she is determined to bring entertainment and good vibes.Clark will be joined by teammates Lexie Hull and Sophie Cunningham, both serving as celebrity caddies during the event. According to NBC Sports, the Golf Channel will provide live coverage of Clark’s round, which means fans can expect plenty of memorable moments between the trio.While Clark focuses on her swing and competitive edge, Cunningham’s carefree spirit will keep things light on the course.

Pat Murphy’s back-to-back win writes a new chapter in baseball's long history of managerial greatness

Milwaukee Brewers manager Pat Murphy has created history by winning the 2025 National League Manager of the Year, becoming the first to claim the honor in consecutive seasons since Bobby Cox’s Atlanta Braves era in 2004 and 2005. The 66-year-old skipper’s latest triumph not only marks a personal milestone but also highlights the Brewers’ transformation into one of the most consistent and disciplined teams in the league. Murphy’s achievement is both rare and defining, placing him in the same breath as the legendary managers who shaped baseball’s modern era.Murphy’s journey with Milwaukee has been defined by belief and balance. After taking over from Craig Counsell, many predicted a rebuilding phase for the Brewers. Instead, Murphy turned skepticism into success, crafting a team built on adaptability, sharp game instincts, and strong clubhouse chemistry. His leadership style blends modern analytical precision with the emotional intelligence of an old-school baseball mind. “He’s not just managing games, he’s managing people,” one player said earlier this season, capturing the essence of Murphy’s impact. His consecutive Manager of the Year honors affirm that leadership in today’s game goes beyond tactics — it’s about creating trust and resilience that lasts through every inning.Pat Murphy now stands alongside some of baseball’s most respected figures, joining a legacy built by names like Bobby Cox, Dusty Baker Jr., Tony La Russa, Joe Maddon, and Buck Showalter. His back-to-back success places him among the few who have managed to sustain excellence across multiple seasons. Since the award’s inception, these names have represented the standard of strategic brilliance and team leadership that defined their eras.A look at the legendary names who've shaped the National League Manager of the Year legacy:2024 – Pat Murphy (Milwaukee)2023 – Skip Schumaker (Miami)2022 – Buck Showalter (NY Mets)2021 – Gabe Kapler (San Francisco)2020 – Don Mattingly (Miami)2019 – Mike Shildt (St. Louis)2018 – Brian Snitker (Atlanta)2017 – Torey Lovullo (Arizona)2016 – Dave Roberts (LA Dodgers)2015 – Joe Maddon (Chi Cubs)2014 – Matt Williams (Washington)2013 – Clint Hurdle (Pittsburgh)2012 – Davey Johnson (Washington)2011 – Kirk Gibson (Arizona)2010 – Bud Black (San Diego)2009 – Jim Tracy (Colorado)2008 – Lou Piniella (Chi Cubs)2007 – Bob Melvin (Arizona)2006 – Joe Girardi (Florida)2005 & 2004 – Bobby Cox (Atlanta)Under Murphy, the Brewers have built their success around strategy, depth, and connection. Without relying on star-heavy rosters, Milwaukee’s consistency has come from its culture of adaptability — a reflection of its manager’s steady influence. His approach to managing pressure, trusting younger players, and fine-tuning rotations has kept the team competitive even against higher payrolls.Murphy’s 2025 victory is more than a personal achievement. It’s a symbol of a manager redefining what success looks like in today’s National League — one built on balance, communication, and faith in the collective. As Milwaukee continues its rise, Pat Murphy’s back-to-back titles aren’t just part of the record books. They are the start of a new chapter in baseball leadership, one that future managers will look up to as the blueprint for sustained excellence.Also read: Fans can’t stop talking about Shohei Ohtani’s heartfelt Dodger Stadium moment with his dog","Pat Murphy is the first manager to win the award in consecutive seasons since Bobby Cox in 2004 and 2005.

The Warriors have struggled with rebounding this season due to their smaller lineup, which gives Holmgren a favorable matchup advantage. Betting experts have projected him to exceed 7.5 rebounds, considering his previous dominant showings against Golden State. His ability to stretch the floor and alter shots defensively could be a deciding factor as OKC looks to contain the Warriors’ high-tempo offense led by Stephen Curry.While Holmgren’s recovery is a major relief, the Thunder are still shorthanded. Key players like Lu Dort, Aaron Wiggins, and Jalen Williams remain unavailable, leaving Holmgren to shoulder additional responsibilities on both ends. His length, rim protection, and shooting touch make him indispensable, especially as Oklahoma City navigates through a challenging stretch of games without several core contributors.Chet Holmgren’s rise has been nothing short of inspiring. After losing his entire rookie season to a devastating Lisfranc foot injury, he has emerged as a cornerstone of the Thunder’s title aspirations. Fans have rallied behind his comeback story, admiring his perseverance and unique blend of size, agility, and skill.

Brittany Mahomes details why ButcherBox fits a household built around food allergy safety



Patrick Mahomes prepares for the Denver Broncos while Kansas City faces AFC West pressure



Patrick Mahomes and Brittany Mahomes spent the Kansas City Chiefs bye week making two very different decisions, and both carried weight for their family. Patrick Mahomes shifted into reset mode after the Chiefs’ loss to the Buffalo Bills, while Brittany Mahomes used the break to announce a new health move shaped by their children’s food allergies.The update came through a series of Instagram Stories, and fans picked up quickly on how closely it aligns with the way the Mahomes family already manages food at home. This is a household with strict rules, and Brittany Mahomes reinforced that routine during the break.Brittany Mahomes told followers that her family is now using ButcherBox, a meat and seafood delivery service. The shift connects directly to the ongoing allergy concerns in the home. Sterling deals with allergies to peanuts, milk and eggs. Bronze has a nut allergy. Their parents have been open about how serious those limitations are during the season.“You know, in this household, we care a lot about what goes into our bodies,” Brittany Mahomes said. “And so this subscription has saved us, you know, that confusion and that, you know, the effort of trying to go out and find good quality fish… It is delivered right to your door, and you can just pop it in the freezer and then thaw it when you are ready to cook.”She followed up with a breakdown of why she trusts the product.“What I really love about Butcher Box is that in all their meats, there are no antibiotics and no added hormones,” she said. “All of their beef is grass-fed and grass-finished. Their chicken is pasteurised, and the fish is all wild-caught.”Brittany Mahomes also shared clips of one of their children seasoning meatballs with her, captioned, “Had a little helper making our @butcher_box meatballs 🤣♥️.” She ended the story with a discount offer and a final line for first-time subscribers: “You can choose your own special offer in your first box OR get ground beef for life!”The timing comes as the Mahomes family continues its visible work with Food Allergy Research and Education. FARE publicly thanked the family this week for their support through the 15 and the Mahomies Foundation. Brittany Mahomes reshared the message, which highlighted the program’s impact on Kansas City families managing similar conditions.Patrick Mahomes used the bye week to regroup with the Kansas City Chiefs after a 28 to 21 loss to the Buffalo Bills. Head coach Andy Reid set the tone immediately.“I’ve got a good locker room,” Reid said. “Rest up and we will come back strong.”Patrick Mahomes echoed that message and put responsibility on the players as they enter Week 11. “Just continue to push away and learn on this bye week and then come back and be ready to play our best football coming off of it,” Patrick Mahomes said.The AFC West race tightened while Kansas City rested. The Denver Broncos beat the Las Vegas Raiders 10 to 7. The Los Angeles Chargers beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 25 to 10. Both results added pressure on the Kansas City Chiefs heading into their matchup with the Denver Broncos at 4:25 p.m. ET.The divide in the Mahomes household this week is clear. Patrick Mahomes focused entirely on pulling the Kansas City Chiefs back into rhythm at the midpoint of the season. Brittany Mahomes focused on the routines that keep their kids safe. Both choices matter for the family, and both unfolded publicly during a week where attention on the Kansas City Chiefs did not slow down.",Brittany Mahomes reveals new family nutrition update during the Kansas City Chiefs bye week.

Antonio Brown pleads not guilty, claims self-defense



More NFL coverage

Antonio Brown is back in Miami -- and this time, it’s not for football. The former NFL star has officially returned to South Florida to face attempted murder charges stemming from a May 2025 incident at a boxing event. Brown, who was detained in Dubai last week and extradited through New York, was seen walking off a private jet in Miami wearing a blue jacket, as captured in a video shared by Andy Slater of Fox Sports 640. Hours later, Brown was booked into the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center, where he posed for a new mugshot.His return marks the latest chapter in a months-long legal saga that began when an arrest warrant was issued earlier this year. Brown, 37, reportedly fled the country before being taken into custody in Dubai. After telling a New Jersey judge he would not contest extradition, Brown was flown back to face charges that could carry a prison sentence of up to 15 years if convicted.Brown’s attorney, Mark Eiglarsh, filed a not guilty plea on his client’s behalf, maintaining that the former wide receiver acted lawfully. According to Eiglarsh, the altercation at the Adin Ross boxing event erupted when Brown was confronted by former friend Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu.The encounter allegedly turned violent before Brown fired shots, an act his defense insists was driven by fear and self-preservation.“Brown was attacked that night and acted within his legal right to protect himself from an individual who had previously committed criminal acts against him,” Eiglarsh said. “The actions he was forced to take were solely in self-defense against the alleged victim's violent behavior. It's a privilege to represent him, and I am determined to ensure that justice is served.”As Brown awaits his first court appearance in Miami, questions remain about whether Florida’s “stand your ground” law will factor into his defense. Legal experts say the case could hinge on whether Brown reasonably believed his life was in danger during the altercation.For now, Antonio Brown faces the possibility of bond restrictions or even house arrest as the court determines the next steps. His once-celebrated football career now stands overshadowed by a courtroom battle that could define his future far more than any game ever did.","Antonio Brown is back in Miami to face attempted murder charges.

When can Jaguars expect Travis Hunter to return from his knee injury?



More NFL coverage

The Jacksonville Jaguars have taken a major hit as rookie sensation Travis Hunter is officially ruled out for the rest of the 2025 season. The team’s second-overall pick, who had been electrifying both sides of the ball, suffered a knee injury during practice in late October, dealing a crushing blow to Jacksonville’s playoff hopes. Initially placed on injured reserve with hopes of a late-season return, the situation took a sharp turn this week when it was confirmed that Hunter had undergone season-ending surgery.On Tuesday, NFL insider Adam Schefter shared the grim update on X, writing, “Travis Hunter underwent surgery today to repair his LCL which will sideline him for the remainder of the season. There was no additional damage beyond his LCL. The procedure was done by Dr. Cooper and Dr. Kaplan in Dallas. He’s expected to return to full football activities within six months.” That timeline gives fans hope that their dual-threat rookie will be back to full strength by the offseason.Based on Schefter’s report and the team’s official update, Hunter’s recovery window puts him on track to resume full football activities by mid-May 2026. This means he should be ready in time for Jacksonville’s training camp next summer.Fortunately, doctors confirmed there was no structural damage beyond the LCL, which significantly boosts his chances for a complete recovery.Before the injury, Hunter was showcasing exactly why he was one of the most hyped prospects entering the league. In just seven games, the 22-year-old proved his versatility—catching 28 passes for 298 yards and a touchdown on offense while making 15 tackles and breaking up three passes on defense. His ability to perform as both a receiver and cornerback made him an invaluable part of the Jaguars’ system.The Jaguars currently sit at 5–4, clinging to the AFC’s final Wild Card spot. However, losing a player of Hunter’s caliber could impact their playoff push significantly. Still, the long-term outlook remains optimistic. If recovery stays on course, Hunter’s full return next season could mark the start of an even more dominant era for Jacksonville’s rising star.",Jacksonville Jaguars rookie Travis Hunter has been ruled out for the rest of the season.

Connor McDavid fuels Oilers’ comeback with unstoppable drive





More NHL coverage

The Edmonton Oilers needed something special on Monday night, and Connor McDavid delivered exactly that. With the team down late in the third period, McDavid’s sheer will and brilliance lifted Edmonton to a stunning 5-4 overtime win over the Columbus Blue Jackets at Rogers Place. It wasn’t just another comeback. It was the kind of performance that reminded everyone why McDavid is considered one of the best in the game -- a player who refuses to let his team go quietly.The Oilers, coming off a humbling 9-1 defeat to Colorado, entered this game under pressure to prove themselves. The fans were restless, and McDavid made sure their frustration didn’t go unanswered. “We hear it,” McDavid said. “We understand what happened on Saturday was not what we want to display to our fans. We’re all trying to win games, and we did that tonight.”Down 4-2 in the third period, McDavid took control. Less than a minute into the frame, he danced past Denton Mateychuk, cut across the crease, and lifted a backhand past Jet Greaves. Later, he struck again, slicing the deficit to one and reigniting belief on the bench and in the stands. His pair of goals sparked the Oilers’ rally, keeping his personal scoring streak alive at five games, with four goals and six assists in that span.“The group likes to put itself in a tough spot and just when you think it’s a tough spot, we go a little bit further,” McDavid admitted, according to NHL.com. “Then we decide it’s time to go. We stuck with it. We put ourselves in a tough spot, but we’re good at coming from behind.”With just 58 seconds left in regulation, Jake Walman’s shot deflected off Zach Werenski to tie the game, and Jack Roslovic sealed the win 56 seconds into overtime.“Connor wasn’t going to let us lose tonight, he was so focused on getting the job done,” coach Kris Knoblauch said. “He had an incredible night, two fabulous goals, but there was just so much determination to his game.”McDavid’s rallying cry of “enough is enough” after the Avalanche loss now rings louder than ever. On Monday, he didn’t just say it -- he proved it.","Connor McDavid scores twice as Edmonton Oilers come from behind to beat Columbus Blue Jackets 5-4 in overtime. The Oilers were down 4-2 in the third period, but McDavid's two goals sparked a comeback. McDavid has now scored in five of his last six games.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125253132,imgsize-38714,width-400,resizemode-4/connor-mcdavid.jpg"
NHL Trade Rumors: Could Brayden Schenn and Nazem Kadri be the next veterans on the move?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-could-brayden-schenn-and-nazem-kadri-be-the-next-veterans-on-the-move/articleshow/125254799.cms,"Nazem Kadri (Image Via Twitter)

Are Brayden Schenn and Nazem Kadri the next big names on the NHL trade market ?

2022-23 Highlights: Brayden Schenn

The St. Louis Blues’ captain, Brayden Schenn, has once again become a figure in the rumor mill because of the team’s poor performance at the start of the season. The Blues, who were at the bottom of the league midway through November, are under more and more pressure to change their roster. According to reports, General Manager Doug Armstrong might already be looking at trade options, and this has led insiders to speculate whether the veteran centerman's era in St. Louis is coming to a close.The rumors about Schenn’s fate got stronger after Jeremy Rutherford from The Athletic and the well-known insider Frank Seravalli reported that Armstrong is ""open for business."" The 34-year-old continues to be a highly valuable trade player because of his experience, physicality, and two-way reliability, which are exactly the qualities the contenders would like to have when looking for a calming factor in the center of the ice. Schenn has a contract that runs up to 2027-28 and carries a cap hit of $6.5 million.On the other hand, even though the Flames have clearly stated that they don't see any reason to deal an offensive player who has a very good reputation with the team like Nazem Kadri, the center with the age of 35, his name keeps being mentioned in Calgary. TSN's Darren Dreger gives the information that the team management wants to retain Kadri because he is the main leader and the most determined person to help the team recover during this season.Sportsnet's Adam Vingan and Nick Kypreos have mentioned the Vancouver Canucks, Montreal Canadiens, and Detroit Red Wings as the most likely ones to make a move, while it is widely believed that the Carolina Hurricanes are on Kadri's no-trade list.The situations of Schenn and Kadri, who have been under the microscope, are a reflection of the uncertainty that comes with the aging stars on the teams that are going through tough times. If their teams decide to change and the trade market becomes more active, their names could be associated with one of the biggest midseason shakeups in the NHL.More coverage on NHL",Brayden Schenn and Nazem Kadri could be the next big names on the NHL trade market.

No off days as captain Shubman Gill, coach Gautam Gambhir arrive in Kolkata for Test series

Security has been significantly tightened at Eden Gardens and across Kolkata ahead of the first India–South Africa Test, following Monday’s fatal car explosion near Delhi’s Red Fort that claimed at least nine lives and injured more than twenty.Confirming the heightened alert, Kolkata Police Commissioner Manoj Verma said special security measures have been rolled out across key city zones, including the iconic stadium, which will host the opening Test from Friday.“We are on high alert. Keeping in mind the blast in Delhi, special and additional security arrangements are being made,” a Kolkata Police official was quoted as saying by IANS. “The Special Task Force (STF) will also be deployed alongside the local police.”Police sources at Lalbazar, the city’s headquarters, revealed that a three-tier security cordon is being implemented at Eden Gardens — covering the outer perimeter, entry gates, and spectator stands. All movements inside and around the venue will be strictly monitored, with entry checks intensified using metal detectors and handheld scanners.Officials added that plainclothes police personnel will be stationed both inside and outside the stadium, and any suspicious activity will trigger an immediate response. Entry with bags or prohibited items will not be allowed.Security has also been reinforced across Kolkata, particularly around the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, Raj Bhavan, Calcutta High Court, and All India Radio, all located close to the stadium.A meeting between the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) and senior police officials is scheduled for Tuesday to finalise protocols and review crowd management plans.Additionally, hotels housing the Indian and South African teams are under enhanced surveillance. Sources said Indian coach Gautam Gambhir’s planned visit to the Kalighat temple may be postponed due to the heightened threat perception.","Security has been significantly tightened at Eden Gardens and across Kolkata ahead of the first India–South Africa Test.

Jagdish Kataria sat trembling outside his house in south Delhi’s Sriniwaspuri. A group of relatives gathered around, hugging and consoling him.His son Amar Kataria had called him around 6.45pm on Monday from his pharmacy in Bhagirath Palace. The two were planning to step out for dinner with the rest of the family later, excited to spend the evening with their loved ones.Jagdish, who runs a tailoring shop in east Delhi’s Mayur Vihar, had taken the day off while Amar was wrapping up work.However, they could not connect on the call. Minutes later, when Jagdish called Amar back, a woman picked up, informing him that she had found his phone in the remains of the blast. Jagdish frantically dialled his son’s alternative number, but there was no response. While they rushed to Red Fort, the family found out he had been taken to LNJP hospital.As the family waited for answers, they found out that Amar had suffered head injuries. Grappling with grief, the family waited for hours at the hospital. They finally received the news that he had been identified as one of the deceased -through a tattoo that said, “Mom my first love, dad my strength.”Jagdish, who completed the last rites on Tuesday morning, told TOI, “My grandson just turned three in Sept.My daughter-in-law Kriti is trying to hold herself together, but she doesn’t know how she will raise her son without his father.”The Katarias hail from Haryana, but Amar and his sister stayed in Delhi their entire lives. The family, which was eagerly looking to celebrate Amar’s 34th birthday on Dec 17, is now trying to cope with immeasurable loss.On Monday, Noman locked up his cosmetics shop in the crowded market of Jhinjhana and told his father he would be back by night. The stock was running low. He had planned a quick trip to Delhi with his cousin Aman Ansari (19), to buy supplies from the wholesalers near Sadar Bazaar. They left after lunch in a hired cab.He had opened the shop barely two years ago, naming it Noor Cosmetics after his mother. Business was modest but steady. Noman was the family’s mainstay: he supported his father Imran Ansari, a small-time farmer; paid for his elder brother’s kidney treatment; and was saving for the weddings of his two sisters. “He never kept a rupee for himself,” said his uncle Mehboob Ansari. “He said once his sisters were married, he’d think about buying a bigger shop. ”By evening, the cousins had reached Delhi. They parked near Red Fort and crossed the road toward the market, joking about how late they’d be by the time they got home. Aman remembers hearing a sound like a tyre bursting, only sharper. The air went white. When the cab driver couldn’t reach them, he called home.Imran dialled Noman and Aman in panic; neither answered. A man finally picked up Aman’s phone and told him they had been caught in the blast. The family rushed to LNJP Hospital. They found Aman unconscious, and another officer led them to the mortuary, where Noman was identified by his red shirt.Ashok and Lokesh had not seen each other in months, but their friendship had stretched across years and cities — from the alleys of Hasanpur in Amroha to the scatter of lives in Delhi. They stayed in touch — an occasional call, a festival greeting, promises to meet that rarely found time.On Monday, Lokesh was in the city to visit an ailing relative at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. Before heading back home, he called Ashok to say he was leaving. Ashok, who was a DTC bus conductor, asked him to wait — just for a little while, just long enough to sit together and talk like they used to, even if only for 10 minutes.The cool air had thickened as the two sat talking on Ashok’s bike near Red Fort metro station, headed to Ashok’s home in Wazirabad. Their conversation was likely mundane — work, children, the small complaints of middle age. Then, in the space between two sentences, the street tore apart. When police reached the site, the car was little more than its frame. Both men had died instantly.By Tuesday afternoon, two white-draped coffins travelled the road back to Amroha — the same road they had taken together so many times before.In Mangrola village, where Ashok’s family lived, the air was heavy with smoke and disbelief. His wife Sonam sat beside the bier holding their youngest child, Aarambh (3), while daughters Aarohi (8) and Kavya (5) stood beside her. His mother Somvati (85), a heart patient, kept whispering that he had just been home for Diwali. “He said he would come again soon,” said his brother Sompal Singh. “He kept his word — only not the way we imagined. ”Fighting back tears, Ashok’s relative Vijay said, “A tattoo of the word ‘Om’ on his hand and the DTC uniform he was wearing helped us identify his body… There’s no one left now to feed the family. The blast has left them in complete darkness.”In Hasanpur, Lokesh’s courtyard was filled with relatives lighting incense and recalling his easy laughter. A widower for five years, he had raised three children — Saurabh, a scientist in Dehradun; Gaurav, an electrical engineer; and Divya, now married. “He never let a friendship fade,” said his cousin Bagish, who had dropped him near the Metro that night. “We told him it was late, but he said, ‘Bas ek mulaqat kar leta hoon — just one meeting. ” Hours later, the call came from Delhi Police.When both coffins reached Amroha the next morning, grief turned into protest. Villagers blocked the road with Ashok’s body, demanding compensation and a govt job for one family member. “Ashok and Lokesh were the only earning members in their families,” a relative said.The last time Pankaj Sahni’s friends and family saw him was around 4.30pm Monday, when he left his home in Kanjhawala to drop a neighbour to Old Delhi Railway Station. Two hours later, news of the blast broke. “I kept calling him repeatedly, but his phone was switched off,” said his father Ram Balak Sahni.It was then that an image of a completely burnt and mangled white cab bearing the numberplate 6662 flashed on their TV screens, and their worst nightmare had come true. “The cab belonged to Pankaj, and we immediately informed his family,” Pankaj’s friend Bittu recalled.Pankaj was on his way to pick up a passenger when the incident. As he reached the signal near Red Fort metro station, his vehicle was hit by a fireball from the high-intensity blast, killing him instantly. A relative said they came to know his cab was just behind the vehicle that exploded.Ram Balak said after seeing the vehicle on the news, he immediately went to Kotwali police station and then to the hospital, but could not locate his son. Around 2am, he received a call from police asking him to come to the mortuary.A native of Bihar, Pankaj had completed his class XII education and was his family’s main breadwinner. “He used to work with a private company, but after losing that job, he started driving a cab. He worked tirelessly, supporting my treatment as I’m a heart patient and helping his younger siblings with their education,” said a grief-stricken Balak Ram, as he waited with some relatives at the mortuary to collect the body.The cab had been bought on loan, which Pankaj was repaying, he added.For the family of Mohammad Jumman (35), an e-rickshaw driver from Shastri Park in northeast Delhi, Monday night was one of agonising uncertainty. His phone location had last shown him stuck in traffic near Lal Qila, after which all contact was lost.Early Tuesday morning, the family reached the LNJP mortuary, their emotions swinging helplessly between hope and despair. His brother Chand showed TOI a screenshot on his phone of Jumman’s last-traced location, frozen amid heavy traffic. Beside him, their uncle Idris clutched a photograph of Jumman on his phone, waiting anxiously for confirmation of what they feared but refused to believe.The family left the hospital premises with tear-stained eyes, still holding to a faint hope that there had been some mistake. Jumman’s 10-year-old son clung tightly to his mother’s finger, trying to console her. A few hours later, their worst fears were confirmed: the body had been identified as Jumman’s. The news shattered whatever strength they had been holding onto, said Idris.Jumman, the family’s sole breadwinner, was the reason his three children, a son and two daughters, were able to attend school, studying in classes 5 to 7. His wife Tanuja has been specially-abled since birth and is unable to walk properly due to a deformity in one of her legs. For years, Tanuja had depended on Jumman for every small need. Now, she is left grappling with the fragile conditions of the household.Idris recalled the last time the family spoke to him, his voice breaking. “He had spoken to his wife, who asked him if he would be having lunch at home. He told her that he would be coming home for dinner. He never came.”On most mornings, Mohsin could be found idling at the mouth of Chawri Bazaar, one hand on the handlebar of his e-rickshaw, the other warming over a cup of sweet tea. The first passengers — porters, clerks, women balancing vegetable baskets — would drift in as Old Delhi uncurled from sleep.He knew the streets by their smells: diesel, spice dust, the damp breath of the Yamuna nearby. Delhi, for all its noise and cost, had given him something close to steadiness — a roof in Daryaganj, regular customers, and school fees that were paid on time.Mohsin had come to the city from Meerut two years ago. He’d left behind his mother Sanjeeda, who phoned every few days to ask if he was eating properly. His wife Sultana and two children — Hifza, 10, and Ahad, 8 – had moved with him. He earned about Rs 400 a day and tucked away a few notes each evening for his children’s education. In the small ledger he kept folded in his shirt pocket, he marked every expense neatly in blue ink.On Monday, Mohsin was driving when the explosion tore through the traffic. His relative Nazim saw the video of the blast on his phone and recognised the spot. He called repeatedly; no one answered. A cop finally picked up and said the phone’s owner had been taken to hospital. “I told him not to go to Delhi,” said Sanjeeda, her voice cracking. “He wanted to work hard for his children’s future.”Ten days ago, Dinesh had travelled from Delhi to his village Ganeshpur in UP’s Shravasti to celebrate Diwali. He spent the afternoon decorating the mud walls of his home with his daughters, Bitta, 7, and Srishti, 4, before joining the evening prayers. His eldest son, Himanshu, 8, clung to his hand, reluctant to let go when it was time for him to leave. “I’ll be back soon,” Dinesh had said. “Just after the next order.”He worked at a printing press in Chandni Chowk, earning enough to send money home every few weeks. The work was hard but steady, and Delhi had begun to feel familiar — a rented room near the press, tea from the same stall each morning.His wife Reena Devi stayed back in Ganeshpur with the children, while his brothers Guddu and Rajesh worked as labourers elsewhere in Delhi. His father, Bhure Mishra, a farmer, called every Sunday to ask if he was eating well. “He always said the same thing,” Bhure recalled later. “Bas kuch din ki baat hai — just a matter of a few days.”On Monday evening, the blast near Red Fort ripped through that small certainty. For hours, the family tried calling. When no one answered, Guddu rode his motorcycle through the city’s chaos toward Chandni Chowk. He was the one who found Dinesh at LNJP Hospital. “I want to appeal to the PM to help us,” said Bhure. “Whatever we receive, it will go to the children.”Villagers gathered outside the Mishra home, some holding small lamps left over from Diwali. Inside, Reena sat on the floor, her hands motionless in her lap. “He called every night,” she whispered. “He said Delhi was noisy but good for work.”","Amar Kataria (33), co-owner of pharmacy, was killed in the blast. Noman Ansari (22), cosmetics shop owner, was on a quick trip to stock up for shop. Dinesh Kumar Mishra (32), printing press worker, had just gone back to work after Diwali.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125263943,imgsize-2232229,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/125263943.jpg"

Jasprit Bumrah vs Injury: Untold story of why Indian cricketers fear getting hurt

South Africa prepare with focus on spin



Ahead of the vital two-match Test series against South Africa, the Indian men's cricket team began their practice session on Tuesday at Kolkata's Eden Gardens, where the first match of the series will be played from November 14 to 18.Shubman Gill, Jasprit Bumrah, Sai Sudharsan, Ravindra Jadeja, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Washington Sundar and Nitish Kumar Reddy took part in the optional session.Shubman Gill spent nearly 90 minutes in the nets as he adjusted back to red-ball cricket after recent white-ball games. Before batting, head coach Gautam Gambhir and assistant coach Sitanshu Kotak spoke with him near the High Court end, news agency PTI reported. Gill then joined slip-catching drills and later batted in the nets with Yashasvi Jaiswal.Gill first batted against spin, facing Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar and played shots on the ground with sweeps at times. He then moved to pace bowling, facing Nitish Kumar Reddy and a few local bowlers. A support staff member used a sidearm for throwdowns from a higher release point to give more bounce and pace. After that, Gill shifted to the central pitch for about 30 minutes of throwdowns with bowling coach Morne Morkel also bowling to him.Yashasvi Jaiswal, coming off scores of 67 and 156 for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy match against Rajasthan, also had a long session on the central wicket, where he faced Morkel and throwdowns and played drives and pulls.Sai Sudharsan also batted for a long period. He scored 84 runs in two unofficial Tests for India A against South Africa A. The team management continues to try him at No. 3. In Tests, though, he is yet to make it his own, with only a 61 against England in Manchester and 87 versus West Indies at home to show so far in Tests.Among the fast bowlers, only Jasprit Bumrah bowled. He kept his workload light, bowling at two stumps for around 15 minutes and targeting the off stump.South Africa also trained on Tuesday after arriving from their hard-earned 1-1 draw against Pakistan in Rawalpindi.With captain Temba Bavuma fit and back to lead the side for the first time since the World Test Championship final win in June, South Africa held a training session with the full squad. The visiting team worked on playing spin and spent the session on plans to counter the Indian spinners.","Shubman Gill, Jasprit Bumrah, Sai Sudharsan, Ravindra Jadeja, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Washington Sundar and Nitish Kumar Reddy took part in the optional session.

You get blinders when you're an addict. You're there, looking through your eyes... but at the same time, you're not all there. Because of that, when I would get high, I wouldn't want to go out in public.”The 70 year old NBA legend also reiterated that he never sold drugs or drove his car while he was “smoking” it.A year back, Micheal Ray Richardson also spoke to The Guardian about drugs being used in the league today.He said, “Even now…it’s not like it was back in the 80s when I was [playing].

Work And Daily Life in Jail





NEW DELHI: Surinder Koli , the accused in the 2006 Nithari serial killings and sentenced to death in 13 murder cases, is set to walk free after 19 years in prison, having narrowly escaped execution twice.Convicted by the trial court and with his appeals and review pleas dismissed by the Allahabad High Court and the Supreme Court, Koli finally secured relief through a curative petition—the final judicial remedy available to an accused seeking justice.HC acquitted Surinder Koli in 12 cases. The Rimpa Haldar case, in which Koli’s death sentence was earlier commuted to a lifeterm by high court in 2015, was the one that kept him in jail. SC's ruling on November 11 acquitted him in this case too.Koli was accused of killing 13 girls and young women aged between 5 and 25, with allegations of cannibalism and necrophilia. In 2006, he was convicted and sentenced to death by the CBI trial court in Ghaziabad. Over the years, his appeals were rejected by the Allahabad High Court and the Supreme Court, and he narrowly escaped execution on multiple occasions.Life in prison was initially harsh. Fellow inmates often taunted Koli over the nature of his crimes, leading him to display volatile behavior.“He was rude, arrogant, demanding, always angry,” a jailer recalled. Koli spent much of his time preparing legal arguments, filing RTIs, and writing drafts for hearings.However, Koli’s demeanor changed over time. Following a curative petition in the Supreme Court, he became increasingly quiet and meditative. Jail officials noted that he had begun praying daily—a practice he never engaged in before—possibly reflecting a belief in his eventual acquittal.Transferred to Greater Noida jail from Dasna in 2023, Koli was assigned the job of a prison guard, overseeing inmates and the mess area. He reportedly took the role seriously, earning Rs 10,000 over six months—the first wages of his life in prison.“His legal files, weighing nearly 20kg, are kept next to his bedding, but he no longer opens them,” said a jailer. Since 2023, Koli has written only two letters: one requesting clothes left behind in Dasna and another regarding a money order.No family members have visited him at Greater Noida, except for Supreme Court advocates and a single visit by his son Rudra Pratap in 2022.After 19 years in prison, Koli is preparing to start life anew. Jailers describe him as calm, disciplined, and cautious about his freedom. “He’s not the same man who came to Dasna in 2006. It seems he is waiting to start his life from scratch,” a jailer said.Surinder Koli’s release marks the end of one of India’s most infamous criminal cases, leaving the nation reflecting on both the failings of the investigation and the complexities of justice.","HC acquitted Surinder Koli in 12 cases.
