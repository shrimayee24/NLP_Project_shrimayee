But his playing career overlapped with the Duke's Mayo Bowl. When they showed him highlights of the 24-10 Minnesota-Virginia Tech win on New Heights With Jason and Travis Kelce, he felt queasy.""Get it off the screen!"" Travis yelled as video rolled of Minnesota coach P.J. Fleck receives the game's traditional mayonnaise bath. Former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason attempted to discuss the bowl game with a calm demeanor, while Travis was in a state of terror.""There's a lot of funny bits they did with the mayonnaise, though. I gotta admit to that,"" Jason said. Travis's pain intensified as contestants drank mayonnaise vats, as footage showed them bobbing in the liquid. ""I'm gonna shut the f---ing computer down if you do anything more with mayo,"" he said firmly.The conversation suddenly segued into drool-inducing discussion about their favorite flavors of the gooey pastry treat. “What was your favorite Pop-Tart growing up?” Travis asked his brother. “My favorite Pop-Tart, if we're not counting Toaster Strudel,” replied Jason.“No, no, no. I'm talking the flavor of, like, the out-of-the-silver-wrapper Pop-Tart,” clarified Travis. “Listen, it's hard to go wrong with the strawberry,” shared Jason. “The f---. They're so good,” agreed Travis. “But the brown sugar one was a nice change up,” added Jason, “I didn't like it all the time, but when I'd had strawberry too many times in a row, it was like a good little switch up.” “It was a nice curveball, yeah.” Travis agreed.Also Read: Travis Kelce's post-retirement dream is centred around his girlfriend Taylor Swift including wedding bells and kids The brothers recollect their childhood, comparing the brown Pop-Tarts they liked, reminiscent of the sticky s'mores and how it always was a nightmare having it ruin the beard Jason sports.

The Building of a Rocket Arm



What Does This Mean for the Patriots?



The Second-Fastest Throw Ever



A Debut to Remember



In his first game in the NFL, young quarterback Joe Milton III of New England Patriots makes history and breaks the record with the fastest pass in history. At an incredible 61.71 mph, the throw was laser fast, and nobody could stop raving about this rare arm strength of Milton's.The Milton pass was jaw-dropping. If the hardest throws in NFL history can be named with such ease, they would be none other than some of the world's greatest quarterbacks today, like Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen, and Justin Herbert. However, Milton's first game with the Patriots had seen him unleash that cannon of a throw, coming at a speed second only to a place on an all-time list.While we’ve seen strong throws from many quarterbacks, to launch a ball at 61.71 MPH in an actual game is a feat that demands recognition. The pass not only placed him in the NFL history books but also left fans wondering just how high Milton’s ceiling could be.Milton's record-breaking throw adds another layer to the growing excitement surrounding the New England Patriots' future. With a strong, physically gifted rookie quarterback now on the roster, many are starting to speculate about Milton's potential role in the team moving forward. It's clear that he possesses the raw talent to be a game-changer, and Patriots fans are hoping this is just the beginning.As the Patriots look to the future, Milton's debut gives a glimpse of what's to come. The team has had its struggles this season, but the rookie's performance is a promising development that could blossom into something special. If he can tap into his power and hone his game, the Patriots may be looking at a QB for the future, one who could lead them into the next era of NFL dominance.To put Milton’s incredible feat into perspective, the only pass faster than his was thrown by former NFL QB, Brock Osweiler, at a staggering 62.8 MPH. But considering the rawness and excitement Milton brings to the table, his second-place throw has already sparked conversations about his future in the league.As Milton continues to develop and mature into a quarterback, it will be interesting to see if he breaks his own record or even comes close to breaking Osweiler's top one.It is still too early to say whether Milton will be one of the future NFL superstars, but this debut performance would surely be talked about for long as one of the most explosive starts in any career. If it's either his arm strength or the plays he can make, Milton is already off to a good start.So, mark this down, NFL fans: Joe Milton III is a name you’ll want to remember. With a rocket arm and a solid debut under his belt, the sky’s the limit for the New England Patriots’ rookie quarterback.Also read - “You Will Respect 10”: Tyreek Hill’s Cryptic Tweet Fuels Speculation Amid Dolphins Drama","New England Patriots rookie quarterback Joe Milton III throws the second-fastest pass in NFL history at 61.71 mph.

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

Dismal performance by India, particular the batters, in the recently-concluded Test series in Australia has received a lot of criticism from former players and experts, all of who believe that there is no other way to improve than going through the grind in domestic cricket, whatever be the stature or reputation of the players.India lost the Border Gavaskar Trophy 1-3 despite taking a 1-0 lead by winning the opening match of the five-Test series in Perth. But continuous poor show of the batters, including that of captain Rohit Sharma and batting legend Virat Kohli , led to three defeats in the next four matches.Rohit even had to 'step aside' for the fifth and deciding Test in Sydney, allowing Shubman Gill to replace him and Bumrah to lead the side. The skipper had scored just 31 runs in his five innings before that in the series.Kohli began the tour well, scoring 100 not out in the second innings at Perth. But his other eight innings in the series produced just 90 runs. His repeated mistakes and getting out caught behind with trouble against deliveries bowled outside his off-stump irritated batting legends like Sunil Gavaskar , who issued a sort of ultimatum to the Indian players at the end of the series.Shubman Gill scored just 93 runs in five innings and Rishabh Pant 255 runs in 9 innings. Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal was the top scorer among Indian batters with 391 runs in 10 innings.

In fact, he might be feeling all right even before he boarded the flight back home. But I am not so sure about it (the exact nature of injury),"" Sinivasan told TOI.""The injury is related to stress, which is a direct result of playing too much cricket.

AB de Villiers identifies who can be the 'next ABD' from South Africa

'A masterstroke!': Allan Donald excited for Dinesh Karthik in SA20

Jacques Kallis answers what makes SA20 special

New Delhi: Before the likes of Rishabh Pant, Suryakumar Yadav came in and revolutionised the game with their shot-making all over the park in the limited overs format, there was AB de Villiers . The South African earned himself the moniker Mr. 360 to highlight his range of shots, ability to hit the ball anywhere, against any bowler and change complexion of the game.The now 40-year-old broke the world record for the fastest ODI century in 2015, reaching the milestone in 31 balls. That race to the ton included the fastest ODI fifty as well as 16 sixes, also a world record at the time.His explosive hitting has been recognised and bewildered fans on this side of the continent as well. He played for Delhi Capitals in the first three years of the IPL but it was with Royal Challengers Bengaluru that he formed a bond. He became one of the league's iconic names and a legend for the franchise, scoring almost 4,500 runs across 11 years.After the 2021 IPL, de Villiers announced his retirement from all forms of cricket. Now, he's part of the SA20 - South Africa's T20 league - as the Ambassador.With 'ABD' now in the past for the IPL, the big draw in swashbuckling shot-making is 'SKY'. The Mumbai Indians batter awes fans and experts alike with his range. But what about South Africa's own 'next ABD '?""I think one player that stands out, and I don't often, or I haven't spoken about him in the past, regularly, is Donovan Ferreira (part of Joburg's Super Kings). The only sad thing is he bats too low in the order to really showcase his true potential. I've spoken about Jordan Hermann. Ryan Rickelton, we've seen now put up his hand for all formats, scoring a 250 in a Test match,"" said AB de Villiers during an interaction ahead of SA20 Season 3.""Donovan Ferreira is not the youngest anymore. But I just haven't seen enough of him, and I wish they could would push him in at number three or four, just from time to time for us to see what he's really capable of. So that will be my pick. Hopefully this will be season of (him) getting more game time and more time up the order.""I think he bats at number six, and he showcased a little bit of what he's capable of last season once or twice, but just not enough balls. I really hope he could come in from Over 6 onwards, you know, and sometimes Over 8. More often than not, he comes in only at the 16th or 17th. So that's one guy I would keep an eye out for. I think he's an out-and-out match winner. Just a fantastic player,"" added De Villiers.Ferreira has played six T20Is for South Africa and scored 79 runs with a best of 48 runs at a strike rate of 158.00. Still very early days in his career where he's played 90 T20s across England's The Hundred, Blast, two games for Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, in the Caribbean Premier League and two SA20 seasons.AB de Villiers put the allrounder in esteemed company by saying the 26-year-old reminds him of the legendary MS Dhoni ""He reminds me bit of MS Dhoni in his prime. I'm not comparing them. I'm saying he reminds me of him where MS was really brutal against the bowlers. He really bludgeoned the ball all parts of the ground. He made guys like Dale Steyn, Mitchell Starc look like they are scared to bowl to him, and that's the feeling I get with Donovan Ferreira. he hits the ball so hard. He's got such a good eye, and hopefully he'll face a few more more deliveries in this coming season,"" said De Villiers.","AB de Villiers says Donovan Ferreira reminds him of MS Dhoni in his prime. 'SKY' bats too low in the order to showcase his true potential, says De Villiers. 'I really hope he could come in from Over 6 onwards, you know, and sometimes Over 8,' he adds.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117050017,imgsize-102122,width-400,resizemode-4/117050017.jpg"

Thehave decided to bench theiras he continues his recovery from offseason double ankle surgery. Head coach Doc Rivers, in a decision aimed at maintaining lineup continuity, informed Middleton of the change on Sunday. With Middleton still on a minutes restriction, this move allows the Bucks to manage his playing time more effectively while inserting Taurean Prince back into the starting lineup.Bringing him in off the bench and putting Taurean Prince back in the starting lineup will perhaps give Rivers more flexibility. Khris Middleton , 33, had already missed the first 21 games of the season due to his injury, making his long-awaited season debut on Dec. 6. Since then, he has appeared in 12 games, starting seven, and has shown flashes of his usual ability, despite the limitations.Through those 12 games, Middleton has averaged 12.7 points, 5.0 assists, 4.4 rebounds, and 1.6 three-pointers per game. His shooting percentages—44.7% from the field and 40.4% from beyond the arc—are notable, especially considering that his minutes per game (23.8) are the fewest since his rookie season. Middleton's scoring average is the lowest it has been since his second NBA season in 2013-14, but that is partly because he has played the fewest minutes per game since his rookie season (23.8).Despite the reduced minutes, Middleton has been effective and efficient. His three-point shooting, at 40.4%, is an improvement over his career mark of 38.8%, indicating that the 2019 All-Star is still contributing at a high level. Middleton's transition to a bench role could provide a much-needed boost for the Bucks as they aim for a deep playoff run. While it may take some adjustment, the move could enhance his impact on the game, especially if he thrives as a scoring threat off the bench.Khris Middleton’s absence from the Milwaukee Bucks ' game against the Toronto Raptors marked the first time he has missed a game since returning from injury, as he was dealing with ankle tendonitis. In his place, Taurean Prince returned to the starting lineup, contributing eight points, four assists, three steals, and two rebounds in a 24-point victory.Also read: Will Karl-Anthony Towns play against the Toronto Raptors tonight?

However, they have made a significant turnaround since starting the season 2-8, largely thanks to MVP-level performances from Giannis Antetokounmpo and improved play from Damian Lillard .

Travis Kelce Fires Back at Bengals Speculations: Chiefs Fear No One



The NFL’s decision to flex Week 18 scheduling delivered a dramatic conclusion to the 2024-25 regular season. The playoff race, especially in the AFC, kept fans on edge, with the Cincinnati Bengals holding onto postseason hopes after their victory against the Pittsburgh Steelers. However, their fate rested on the performances of the Denver Broncos and Miami Dolphins.The Miami Dolphins lost to the New York Jets, leaving the latter as the deciding team for Cincinnati's possible visit to the playoffs. However, the Broncos thwarted those dreams when they crushed the Chiefs in a shocking 38-0 rout, thereby securing a playoff birth of their own. This triggered speculation among the social media karaoke, with some fans suggesting that the Chiefs had gone deliberately lame to avoid facing the Bengals in the playoffs.Amid these accusations, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce addressed the narrative head-on during an episode of the ""New Heights"" podcast alongside his brother, Jason Kelce. Known for his fiery personality, Kelce did not hold back.""I ain't scared of f– nobody!"" Kelce declared. ""I wanted them in the f– playoffs! I want to slay every dragon one by one like 'Mortal Kombat.' I don't even want this to be like a 'we play the lowest seed [situation]'. Just give me the best teams. AFC, NFC, give me all of them 'Mortal Kombat' style. I'll go through every f– one of them, just giving them my best f– effort. I ain't scared of a single soul, man.""Kelce's words tells us lot about the Chiefs' confidence. He went further, tipping his hat to the Bengals, calling them fierce competitors, albeit not intimidating.""I'll play them at the Walmart parking lot,"" Kelce quipped. ""I don't give a s–. We can have our own game in the offseason where we really duke it out again. Listen, I love competing against the greatest. The Bengals were a fun ass f– team to watch there toward the end of the season. It's a shame they didn't make it in the playoffs, because they would've made the playoffs that much f– crazier and that much more fun.""The revised version creates an immense challenge for even the finest offense in the league—Joe Burrow and his fantastic company of receivers. But for KC, this is some teasing sweet because they did not have to face Cincinnati in the playoffs. The Bengals would have had to beat the Buffalo Bills to get to the Chiefs, and they really weren't playing close to their former defensive prowess, as proved by the firing of defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo earlier this week.Also Read: Will Multi-Grammy Award Winner Taylor Swift Join Travis Kelce and Jason in New Heights Podcast? Kansas City, after an impressive 15-2 regular season, has little to fear in the AFC. The Bills, having beaten the Chiefs earlier this season, might pose a threat, but Cincinnati no longer carries the weight of a conference rival. With Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce leading the charge, the Chiefs remain the team to beat, undeterred by any speculation.","Travis Kelce fires back at Bengals Speculations: Chiefs Fear No One.

LeBron James explains the reason behind the Lakers’ recent loss to the Mavericks



Former Los Angeles Lakers player Kwame Brown has sparked controversy after criticizing LeBron James , accusing the NBA icon of negatively impacting the league. In a candid interview, the ex-teammate pointed to James' influence on player movement and the team’s overall performance as factors contributing to what he believes is a decline in the league's competitiveness. While the Lakers legend remains one of the most celebrated athletes in sports history, this criticism adds to the ongoing debate about his legacy and the changes in the NBA.LeBron James has made his name among the few top NBA stars claiming elite status. For many fans and analysts, James is the greatest of all time. While the other portion of fans would crown Michael Jordan with the GOAT status, James has certainly become a global star with stunning records and accolades to his name. However, former Lakers player Kwame Brown is not so impressed with what James’ is doing in the league. In a recent video posted on social media, Brown slammed the Lakers legend with some harsh words. “I believe LeBron James is going to leave the game worse than he found it,” Brown said in the video.“That’s just my particular opinion because he doesn’t have any accountability for how he’s impacted the game,” he continued accusing him of changing playing style in the NBA over the years. “LeBron James is a football player playing basketball,” he asserted claiming that James single-handedly impacted the league’s overall style. Brown also took a jab at everyone going on with James’ tactics, “They changed the rules to accommodate his skill set,” he added.Brown went on to explain, “They got rid of the power forward. They got rid of all these people that can contest his shots and be there at the basket. So he have a wide open lane and do what he does.”James has recently responded to the Lakers' devastating 118-97 loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday night at the American Airlines Center. “It’s just another night for us where we’re not good offensively. We didn’t shoot the ball well, and we missed a lot of shots at the rim, and they countered that,” James said in a postgame interview.He went on to add, “They had a great game plan versus our defense and obviously they watched to see how we play. They had a great game plan, put us in a lot of pick-and-rolls, spread us out, a lot of times it was five-out when (Dereck) Lively wasn’t in the game.”Also Read: LA Lakers Trade Rumor: GM Rob Pelinka might consider $250 million guards interest to make a ""Big 3"" with LeBron James and Anthony Davis James candidly admitted the team's terrible performance in the game. “We had a horrible finish to the second quarter after we were up 50-44.

Giles Moriarty, a 57-year-old Elvis Presley super fan from March, Cambridgeshire, shared that his fascination with the King of Rock 'n' Roll never wavered, despite discovering the artist’s music almost five decades back.As 8 January marks what would have been Presley’s 90th birthday, Moriarty reflected on his enduring admiration for the hound dog singer, who passed away in 1977.The turning point for Moriarty came in 1977 when he stumbled upon a vinyl record in his parents' collection, at the age of eight as per BBC news.""Had he been alive today, I think Elvis would have hung up his Blue Suede Shoes, but would have enjoyed reflecting on his immense success,"" Moriarty said.Moriarty’s devotion to the rock icon can be seen in the dedicated ""Elvis room"" at his home, filled with hundreds of books, records, and memorabilia, that he collected for more than half a century.For Moriarty, the king has been a constant companion. His music ""feeds my soul"", claims MoriartyFurther reflecting on his school days, he recalled, ""I was not cool at school in 1977. The other kids were discovering punk rock, but not me.”For Moriarty, Elvis’ influence stretched far beyond music. He recalled finding a rare 1955 Sun Records single of “Baby Let’s Play House” in his parents' collection, a song that challenged societal norms at the time through its suggestive lyrics.""People forget what a ground-breaking artist he was,"" Moriarty said.Despite Elvis' troubled personal life, including battles with drug addiction, Moriarty remains undeterred in his love for the music.""None of that matters, it's the music that I love. He had a Shakespearean arc to his life: the rags to riches story, and of course, an undesirable end, which is almost a requirement for a Shakespearean classic,"" he reflected.Moriarty’s deep admiration for Presley was often met with criticism. His family often referred to his devotion as “mad” or “totally Loony Tunes,” though Moriarty clarified that he did not mind at all.To him, Elvis was a ""constant"" in his life.Elvis Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, on 8 January 1935, and became a cultural icon following his career’s meteoric rise from humble beginnings. With his distinctive voice, charisma, and revolutionary influence on American music, Presley is considered a figure that reshaped pop culture.","Giles Moriarty, 57, from March, Cambridgeshire, discovered Elvis Presley's music at the age of eight.

NEW DELHI: Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has expressed his strong support for Indian batting superstar Virat Kohli , stating that if he was captain he would ""fight with the team management"" to ensure Kohli remains in the squad despite his recent struggles in Test cricket.Clarke made these remarks on the Beyond23 Cricket podcast, where he discussed Kohli's form during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and his overall importance to the Indian team.Clarke acknowledged that Kohli hadn't scored as many runs as he would have liked in his recent Test matches but emphasized the batter's immense talent and impact. ""It's Virat Kohli! This guy can make a double hundred tomorrow. He's that good a player. This guy could play, he should play until he's had enough.

Jacques Kallis answers what makes SA20 special

South African cricket is currently in a state where it’s pinch me, wake up, everybody’s dreaming territory.After an administrative malaise which inadvertently led to the South African men's team, in particular, stumbling for a few years, the Rainbow Nation is now up and running again.The women’s team kickstarted the revolution by shattering the glass ceiling of reaching a first-ever ICC T20 Women’s World Cup final. They repeated the act the very next year in the UAE.Not to be outdone, the men’s team followed suit by progressing to their maiden ICC T20 World Cup final in Barbados last year and now, the Test side have topped the World Test Championship table to earn a spot at the main dining table at Lord’s in June.All of these achievements over the past two years coincided with the launch of the SA20 – the domestic T20 competition that has been an astounding success on the field whilst providing a much-needed financial boost to Cricket South Africa ’s balance sheet.The third instalment is set to get underway in Gqeberha on Thursday when back-to-back champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape host MI Cape Town at St George’s Park with the excitement reaching an all-time in South Africa.“I think from the beginning we were open and honest about bridging the gap between domestic cricket and international standards. To have six franchises that are competitive and bring out top support teams and then the players are also playing with and against the best players in the world,” SA20 Commissioner Graeme Smith said.“Then you add crowds and production… I remember season 1 where so many young players hadn't experienced such television productions before. Hopefully that will start developing more players pushing for places within the Proteas.”Smith feels that SA20 is ready to take the game in South Africa to even greater heights in Season 3.“Two seasons in I feel we are now an established product. We’re probably the biggest league outside of the IPL. Being able to attract the six franchises that we have, they very professional, very competitive,” the former Proteas captain said.“We’ve had quality local and international players. The squads look even stronger in Season 3. You look across the squads and you can so see many matchups.“Every year the cricket is getting better and seeing the progression of players is key to me. From a fan perspective, we are investing heavily again. There is something for everyone from the kids to adults who want to enjoy a really good experience inside the stadium,” he added.The season opener will feature a blockbuster face-off between the Sunrisers Eastern Cape and MI Cape Town.It is, of course, a rematch for two skippers Aiden Markram (Sunrisers) and Rashid Khan (MI Cape Town) after they last went head-to-head in the ICC T20 World Cup semi-final in Tarouba, Trinidad.This is but one of the subplots to look forward to over the month-long competition that will no doubt captivate audiences both in South African and abroad.","South African cricket is currently in a state where it’s pinch me, wake up, everybody's dreaming territory.

NEW DELHI:

After enduring a tough Test season, the national selectors will have a tricky selection meeting looking ahead to the Champions Trophy next month. While all the talk has been around Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli 's Test form, TOI understands that Ravindra Jadeja 's future across formats hangs in balance.According to BCCI sources, the team management under coach Gautam Gambhir and selectors is keen on getting a core ready for the 2027 ODI World Cup. Jadeja's off-colour performances in both Tests and white-ball cricket is a cause for concern. It will be interesting to see if they start the planning for the ODI World Cup with the Champions Trophy itself.""Gambhir has been very assertive about creating core teams according to formats. As of now, he hasn't quite tinkered with the longer formats but has a clear vision for creating a strong base for the ODI World Cup. He is keen on giving exposure to a few more identified players,"" a BCCI source told TOI. ""It's all about when the selectors decide the transition needs to kick in. They will discuss if they want to go with a safe option in Jadeja or move on right now,"" the source added.The selectors have been on the fence with Jadeja in ODIs. Jadeja's batting prowess has been on the decline. He hasn't had the desired impact with the bat coming at No.7 in ODIs over the last two years. For someone who is tasked with raising the run-rate at the back-end of an innings, Jadeja's strike rate has been as low as 75. He was not picked for the ODI series in Sri Lanka after he announced his T20I retirement post the T20 World cup triumph in July last year.Also See: Champions Trophy Full Fixtures ""Even in Test cricket, he has struggled to get going, though his bowling has been steady.

But the selectors will have to take a call during the home season. For the Champions Trophy, selectors will be aware that pitches in Dubai have historically been helpful to slow bowlers,"" the source said.The selectors may be tempted to pick an extra left-hander in the batting lineup.

Two-tier system: Cricket faces its latest test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/two-tier-system-cricket-faces-its-latest-test/articleshow/117069665.cms,"West Indies Test team (ANI Photo)

Hardly had the dust settled on the Border-Gavaskar series Down Under when a piece of news floated and created a flutter in the cricketing world. It has emerged that Australia , England, India, and the International Cricket Council’s new chair, Jay Shah , are in talks to split Test cricket into two divisions so that the Big Three can play each other more often in blockbuster series.According to a report in the Australian newspaper The Age, Cricket Australia chair Mike Baird and England Cricket Board boss Richard Thompson are set to meet later this month, with a two-tier structure for Test cricket on the agenda.The discussions around this concept have gained momentum due to the 2024-25 BGT series, comprising five Tests, being the fourth-best attended series in Australia, with record crowds in Melbourne and Sydney, alongside high TV viewership.However, according to the report, any plan to move to two divisions in Test cricket would only take effect after the current Future Tours Programme concludes in 2027. This is also the year when a 150th-anniversary Test match between Australia and England is scheduled at the MCG.As per the proposal, India, Australia, and England would no longer be required to play all cricketing nations and could rejig their cycles to play each other twice every three years, rather than twice every four years as is currently the case. The ICC has remained silent when asked for a reaction.Ironically, this development comes at a time when Australia is set to play South Africa—often excluded from the ‘Big Three’ plans—in the World Test Championship final at Lord’s in June.The concept has its loyal supporters. Commentating on SEN Radio during the fifth Test at Sydney, former India coach Ravi Shastri expressed concern over the crowded schedule, advocating for more “best versus the best” matches in Test cricket. “I’ve always believed that if you want Test cricket to survive and thrive, this is the way to go. The top teams should play each other more often, creating a contest,” Shastri said.The potential impact on the development—and even survival—of Test cricket in the West Indies, once a cricketing powerhouse, is troubling. Naturally, voices from the West Indies have expressed concern. “A two-tier system makes sense, but space must be made for top nations to tour those in the lower bracket, or smaller nations will disappear,” warned West Indies fast-bowling legend Michael Holding in his column in The Telegraph.Holding’s former captain Clive Lloyd also expressed his unease, believing that efforts should instead focus on ensuring struggling teams get more opportunities to play against the top sides.“I think it will be terrible for all those countries who worked so hard to achieve Test status. Now they’ll be relegated to playing among themselves in the lower section. How will they reach the top? (Only) by playing against better teams,” said the 80-year-old during an online media interaction.“Honestly, a two-tier system shouldn’t happen. It’s not ideal because only the top three teams will earn more revenue,” a former Indian cricketer of repute told TOI, highlighting the move’s economic imbalance. “And if you’re talking about quality, it’s not as though India played high-class cricket in Australia.Instead of this, the ICC should support smaller, weaker cricketing nations and focus on improving their skill levels. A proper WTC cycle, where everyone plays everyone, would be a better idea. In this WTC cycle, even Sri Lanka and Bangladesh had a chance of making it to the final at one stage. Almost all the teams were winning away from home and beating each other,” he said.It is important to note that 2024 was a year of unexpected results in Test cricket, making it an unusually exciting period for the red-ball format. This included West Indies stunning Australia in a pink-ball Test at the Gabba in Brisbane and India’s 3-1 defeat in the BGT last week. In this context, many argue that the past year has seen the rebirth of Test cricket.“A couple of years back, in 2022, Bangladesh secured their maiden Test win in New Zealand at Mount Maunganui. We need to ensure that Test cricket remains alive and exciting. Who says Test cricket is dying? There are matches lasting the full five days too,” said the cricketer.Apart from the skewed revenue sharing, there is also a practical issue with this concept. “I feel that this idea would be good and feasible if there were 15 teams playing Test cricket,” said former India wicketkeeper and chief selector Kiran More . “At the moment, that isn’t the case. You just have nine to ten countries playing the five-day game. How much can you shuffle between so few teams in two tiers?” asked More.Back home, domestic cricket stalwarts saw shades of the Ranji structure in the concept. “It’s a very good idea. If you can have six top cricketing nations in Tier 1 and six in Tier 2, it could work well,” said current UAE head coach Lalchand Rajput. “A lower-ranked team like Zimbabwe, for example, would get hammered if it played against India or Australia. After the end of a WTC cycle, the bottom two in the top six could be relegated to the second tier, while the top two could be promoted for the next WTC cycle. This would mean that there would be something to play for in all the WTC matches,” explained the former India opener.“Like the Ranji Trophy, relegation and promotion would make things more exciting. A two-tier system would ensure that the best teams get to play against each other more often, leading to healthy competition. The lower-ranked teams would have the motivation to perform well, beat the top sides, and move up to Tier 1, while Tier 1 teams would strive to maintain their position,” he said. “Currently, West Indies, and to an extent even Sri Lanka, don’t have strong Test teams, which means that the top sides look to secure big wins against them to accumulate points for WTC final qualification,” added Rajput.Since its inception in 2019, the success of the WTC has shown that change in Test cricket isn’t always detrimental. With broadcasters eager for more matches involving India, England, and Australia, the ICC, under its new chair Jay Shah, supported by England and Australia, will undoubtedly think carefully about the two-tier concept.In a potential win-win, could this also free up space for a second IPL in the September-October window—a lucrative prospect the BCCI has long been keen on? Watch this space!","Cricket Australia, England, India, and the International Cricket Council’s new chair, Jay Shah, are in talks to split Test cricket into two divisions.

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

It doesn't read too flattering, TOI's Report Card following India's performance in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Down Under. Apart from topper Jasprit Bumrah and new boy, Jaiswal, the rest disappointed, were poor in application and betrayed. A lack of depth that led to an embarrassing 3-1 verdict in Australia's favour. Hindol Basu gives out the grades, return it signed at your own risk.If he could have been rated more than 10, Bumrah would deserve it for his superlative, superhuman performance. Pivotal in keeping India competitive in the series, he was the standout performer, a show which earned him the Player of the Series award.On his first tour to Australia, Jaiswal emerged as India's highest run-scorer with 391 runs at an average of 43.44, including a century and two halfcenturies. His aggressive yet calculated knock of 161 in the Perth Test helped India start the series on a victorious note. In Melbourne too, his twin 80s raised India's hopes for a draw, but it wasn't to be.Rahul had a mixed series, reflecting both promise and inconsistency. He scored 276 runs at an average of 30.66, including two half-centuries: 84 in Brisbane and 77 in Perth. His 201-run opening partnership with Jaiswal in Perth was the highlight, but inconsistency plagued him in the subsequent matches.Kohli's form was below par – he managed only 190 runs at an average of 23.75. Despite a century in Perth, his on-field frustrations were evident throughout the series. Kohli's struggles were characterized by a recurring weakness: being dismissed 8 times out of 9 to deliveries outside off stump, leading to easy catches in the slip cordon.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy Missing the opening Test due to the birth of his child, the Indian captain had the strangest of tours, sitting out of the final Test amid retirement speculation. He struggled, scoring just 31 runs in five innings at an average of 6.20. His form and leadership came under scrutiny. His performance marked the lowest average for any touring captain in a Test series in Australia. As captain too, not only did he lack imagination, Rohit made decisions that lacked clarity.Pant had an inconsistent series. His aggressive batting was both an asset and a liability, with some reckless shots drawing criticism. Pant struggled to convert promising starts into significant scores throughout the series. His 61 off 33 balls in the Sydney Test was a standout knock, but he couldn't convert it into a matchwinning one.In his debut series, Reddy scored 298 runs at an average of 37.25, including a historic century at the MCG. His bowling was less effective, yielding only five wickets. Reddy's success positioned him as a long-term prospect for the Indian Test team. The series also showed his ability to adapt and deliver under pressure.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 Siraj took 20 wickets, the second highest for India, but was often expensive, averaging over 31. He faced criticism for leaking runs at times, especially his 0-122 in Melbourne which raised alarm. Siraj bowled a total of 157.1 overs, the most by any Indian bowler in the series, over Bumrah's 151.2. Despite his wickets tally, Siraj's performance fluctuated throughout the series.Gill's performance was disappointing, scoring only 93 runs at an average of 18.60. At the No. 3 position, he failed to capitalize on starts. His batting seemed to be confused and lacking in intent.Jadeja's contribution was below expectations, with 135 runs at an average of 27 and only four wickets in three Tests. His overall performance affected the team's balance during the tour. While his batting at times provided lower-order resistance, his lack of wicket-taking ability was notable.Ashwin played only one Test, taking a single wicket before announcing his retirement from international cricket after the third Test in Brisbane. His retirement appeared contentious and sparked discussions about the timing.In three matches, Washington scored 114 runs at an average of 22.80 and took three wickets at an average of 38.66, failing to make a significant impact in either department. While he showcased moments of resilience with the bat, particularly in Melbourne, his overall impact was limited by underutilization as a bowler.Playing in the final Test in Sydney, Krishna impressed with six wickets at an average of 17.83, stepping up in Bumrah's absence and showcasing potential for the future. His performance at the SCG not only demonstrated his potential, but also highlighted lack of clarity in team selection, as what could have been had he been included earlier.Akash Deep's moment under the sun in the BGT came with the bat instead of his bowling. He scored an invaluable 31 in a critical situation during the first innings of the Brisbane Test, the knock helping India avoid a follow-on, and draw the Test. With the ball, he showed promise but failed to get wickets.Rana's BGT sojourn was a tale of two contrasting outings: an impressive debut in Perth followed by a significant drop in form thereafter. His future prospects will depend on how he addresses his inconsistencies and adapts to the pressures of international cricket.Padikkal played just the first Test in Perth. He was dismissed for a duck in the first innings after facing 23 balls, but in the second essay he stitched together a decent partnership with Jaiswal. He showed promise during the 25-run stay at the crease.Jurel showed promise during the ‘A' series before the BGT, which led to him being picked for the Perth Test. But knocks of 11 & 1 didn't help his cause and he wasn't a part of the playing XI in the remaining Tests.Gambhir did his reputation no favour on the tour, his first big test as coach. His team selection, strategies, decisions and dressing room unity all came under intense scrutiny as the team faltered. Critics questioned the effectiveness of the coaching staff, particularly in addressing the team's batting inconsistencies and tactical nous.",Jasprit Bumrah named Player of the Series. Yashasvi Jaiswal named highest run- scorer. Virat Kohli's form below par. Rohit Sharma's captaincy under scrutiny. Mohammed Siraj's bowling was less effective.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117039741,imgsize-45668,width-400,resizemode-4/117039741.jpg"

Joburg Super Kings are one of the three teams who have been into the playoffs for both the SA20 seasons so far. They finished semi-finalists in the inaugural edition and were knocked out in Qualifier 2 last year. Continuing under Faf du Plessis ' leadership, they hope to at least make it one better this time around.Towards that objective, Joburg Super Kings have invested in bringing in experience to take that extra step. “We’ve had some great signings in Jonny Bairstow Devon Conway and Matheesha Pathirana . Those three guys and (Tabraiz) Shamsi are four proper cricket players. All in all our squad is very balanced,” Du Plessis said on the eve of the tournament, which gets going on 9 January.For JSK, the biggest hurdle coming into the season was the string of injuries to bowlers. Gerald Coetzee had been ruled out of the international summer due to a groin injury. He had also missed the second season for the franchise with a pelvic inflammation. This time, Faf and rest of the franchise would be hoping he remains injury free.The franchise have already lost seamers Nandre Burger and Lizaad Williams to injury.In the spin bowling department, JSK have Tabraiz Shamsi and Moeen who are certains for the playing XI. Then Imran Tahir or Lizaad Williams can come in as the conditions.With the bowling weakened, the batting will have plenty to do to give the bowlers something to defend. The onus of that will lie on Bairstow, Conway, Faf, Leus du Plooy, Donovan Ferreira, who AB de Villiers has dubbed as the ""next South African ABD"", Moeen Ali and David Wiese.Three in four of Joburg Super Kings' new faces to SA20 are experienced cricketers. Barring Rookie all-rounder JP King, the franchise have brought to their midst England wicketkeeper-batter Bairstow, New Zealand opener Conway and Sri Lanka's Pathirana (the team's Wildcard).At the auction, Joburg Super Kings spent R175,000 each on allrounders Wihan Lubbe and Evan Jones.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli 's woeful run with the bat in Test cricket continues to be a talking point in the cricketing circles with his former Royal Challengers Bengaluru teammate Faf du Plessis throwing his weight behind his potential return to form.In the five Tests of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Kohli scored just 190 runs at an average of 23.75 and was dismissed eight times chasing deliveries outside the off-stump.Since 2020, Kohli's Test numbers reveal a stark decline. In 39 matches, he has scored 2,028 runs at an average of 30.72, including just three centuries, suggesting that Kohli is going through his career's all-time lowest phase.Du Plessis believes Kohli, known for his immense drive and past successes, will instinctively know how to navigate through tough phases and return to form when the time is right.""Yeah, it's different for every player. Every player needs to answer that question himself. I remember when that time was for me. I just knew that, certainly from a Test cricket perspective for me, I didn't have that same hunger and drive for Test cricket anymore, and I felt that that stage, certainly for me, was a good time to let new guys come in and also step into the T20 world. So I wanted to do that at a stage where I still felt like I was on top of my game,"" du Plessis said while addressing press conference for SA20 Season 3's Captain's Day.""That's very, very personal. No one can speak to you about when that time is. As a player, you'll know. I know someone like him. He's super, super motivated.

He retires as the nation's leading run-scorer in T20Is with 3,531 runs.The opener also accumulated 7,346 ODI runs, placing him third on New Zealand's all-time run-scorers list.“As a young kid it was always my dream to play for New Zealand and I feel incredibly lucky and proud to have played 367 games for my country. I will forever cherish the memories made wearing the silver fern alongside a great group of guys. I want to say a huge thanks to all my team-mates and coaching staff over the years, in particular Mark O’Donnell who has coached me since the Under 19 level and been a source of ongoing support and wisdom over my career.“A special thanks must also go to my manager Leanne McGoldrick - all of the work behind the scenes never went unnoticed and I’ll be forever appreciative of all your support. To my wife Laura and our beautiful children Harley and Teddy – thank-you. Thank you Laura for the sacrifices you have made for me and our family. You’ve been my biggest supporter, my rock and my counsel through all of the ups and downs that come with the game. I am eternally grateful. Finally I’d like to thank all the cricket fans, here in NZ and around the world for all their support throughout the years,” said Guptill in a New Zealand Cricket (NZC) statement.Guptill will continue to participate in various T20 leagues around the world.Making his international debut in 2009, Guptill achieved a significant milestone in 2015, becoming the first Kiwi male batter to score a double-century in an ODI. His remarkable 237 not out came against the West Indies in the 2015 ODI World Cup quarter-final at Wellington Stadium. He also holds the distinction of having three of New Zealand's top four individual ODI scores.Throughout his international career, Guptill struck an impressive 1,385 fours and 383 sixes. He is also remembered for a memorable run-out of MS Dhoni in the 2019 ODI World Cup semi-final, the pivotal moment that helped New Zealand secure victory against India in Manchester.","Martin Guptill has announced his retirement from international cricket. The 38-year-old played for New Zealand in 198 ODIs, 122 T20Is and 47 Tests. The opener also accumulated 7,346 ODI runs, placing him third on the all-time run- scorers list.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117057865,imgsize-24156,width-400,resizemode-4/117057865.jpg"

Young Indian player Abhimanyu Easwaran ’s cricketing journey is a tale of grit and patience. Despite a stellar domestic record, including consistent performances for Bengal and India A, the domestic doyen continues to wait for his maiden India cap.Known for his composure and ability to play long innings, Easwaran, who has been grinding it out in domestic cricket for over a decade, got his share of luck after being part of the Indian squad on quite a few occasions but luck eluded him every time, as he remained on the sidelines.In January 2021, Easwaran was first named as one of five standby players in India's Test squad for the home series against England. A few months later, in May 2021, he was again named as one of four standby players for India’s Test squad for ICC World Test Championship (WTC) final and the subsequent away series against England.Two and a half years later, Easwaran was named as a replacement for the injured Ruturaj Gaikwad during the two-Test series against South Africa in December 2023. He was once again called up, this time as the third opener for the five-Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) against Australia.The 29-year-old has been a prolific run-scorer in domestic cricket, amassing over 7,600 first-class runs in 101 matches. With an impressive average of nearly 50, his tally includes 27 centuries and 29 fifties, reflecting his consistency and ability to deliver big innings at the domestic level.Easwaran got the BGT call at the perfect time as he has scored five centuries in his last six first-class matches, showcasing remarkable consistency, including an unbeaten double ton against Bihar in Ranji Trophy His latest hundred came against Uttar Pradesh in the Ranji Trophy before leaving for India A tour to Australia. Prior to that, he hammered a commanding 191 against Mumbai in the Irani Cup, further cementing his reputation as a big-match player. Earlier in the season, Easwaran displayed his prowess with two fine century knocks in the Duleep Trophy.In Rohit Sharma's absence for the first Test, Easwaran seemed a natural choice to step in as opener. However, his below-par performances against Australia A proved costly. In the two A-games, Easwaran managed scores of just 7, 12, 0, and 17, leading to the team management overlooking him for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Instead, Easwaran’s India A teammate, Devdutt Padikkal , who impressed with 151 runs in four innings, was preferred and included in the final XI. This decision highlighted the management's lack of faith in Easwaran, despite his domestic heroics, leaving him on the sidelines once again.With runs in abundance under his belt, Easwaran's exclusion raises questions about selection policies and competition in Indian cricket. For a player who epitomises perseverance, the wait for an Indian cap seems perpetual, leaving fans and critics wondering what more he must do to make the cut in the playing XI.","Ahimanyu Easwaran is a prolific run-scorer in domestic cricket.

By the time the 2026 FIFA World Cup begins, Brazil star Neymar will have reached 34 years of age; and while he is confident of the team's qualification, the veteran striker is also hopeful of making it to the squad for his last appearance in the prestigious tournament.In an interview with the CNN, Neymar said he won't leave any stone unturned to ensure that he is part of the team.""I know this will be my last World Cup, my last shot, my last chance and I will do everything I can to play in it,"" said Neymar.He has not made an international appearance for more than a year.Brazil's performance in the South American World Cup qualifiers has been below expectations so far, currently positioned fifth among 10 competing nations after completing 12 out of 18 rounds. The top six teams in the end qualify for the tournament.""I have a lot of faith in the team, in the players who are emerging, who are young,"" he said. ""We're not in a position where we would like to be. I think together we can achieve something very big. We have a year, a year-and-a-half to work, to do the right things to reach the World Cup.""Following his knee injury during Brazil's defeat to Uruguay in October 2023, Neymar underwent surgery that kept him sidelined for twelve months. He had participated in Brazil's initial four qualifying matches before the setback.Neymar made a brief comeback with Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal, appearing twice between October and November, but subsequently suffered a hamstring strain. Since then, he has remained inactive.""I want to be there (at the World Cup); I'm going to try to do my best, to work very hard so that I can be with the Brazilian team,"" he said.During the interview, Neymar also mentioned he won't rule out playing beside former Barcelona team-mates Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez at US club Inter Miami.""Obviously, playing again with Messi and Suarez would be incredible,"" Neymar, who also played with Messi at Paris Saint-Germain, said at an award ceremony in Dubai.""They are my friends. We still speak to each other. It would be interesting to revive this trio,"" he added.""I'm happy in Saudi Arabia, but who knows? Football is full of surprises.""The expanded Club World Cup scheduled for June will feature both Al Hilal and Miami, where he could face off against Messi and Suarez on American soil.",Neymar says he will do everything he can to make it to the 2026 World Cup. He has not played for Brazil for more than a year due to a knee injury. The 34-year-old says he won't rule out playing with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117070319,imgsize-41160,width-400,resizemode-4/117070319.jpg"

Sharp Yamal

Young starlets Gavi and Lamine Yamal fired Barcelona , without Dani Olmo after his licence to play was revoked, into the Spanish Super Cup final with a 2-0 win against Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday.Spanish playmaker Olmo was cleared to play again on a temporary basis before the game but the decision came too late for him or Pau Victor, in the same position, to feature against Copa del Rey winners Athletic.Gavi put Barcelona ahead from close range after 17 minutes and teenage winger Yamal netted the second early after the break.Spanish and European champions Real Madrid face cup runners-up Mallorca on Thursday in the second semi-final in Saudi Arabia, where the competition has been held for the past few years.""Athletic are a very physical team that make you run a lot, we suffered above all towards the end, but we were able to play well and we're very happy,"" Yamal told Movistar.The winger said Olmo and Victor were pleased to be allowed to play once more.""In the end you're nervous when you can't play and when you get news like that, you're very happy,"" added Yamal.Barca coach Hansi Flick hailed the decision from Spain's national sports council regarding Olmo and Victor.""The whole club is very happy for this right decision,"" said Flick, hoping to win his first silverware at the helm of Barca.""We wanted to show we are a team and we win also for them.""Barcelona, who qualified as La Liga runners-up, started brightly and Raphinha volleyed over from a fine Jules Kounde cross and forced Unai Simon into a good save with a free-kick.It was no surprise when the Catalans broke the deadlock with Alejandro Balde cutting the ball back for Gavi, playing in Olmo's attacking midfield role, to turn home for his first goal since suffering a severe knee injury last season.The 20-year-old pointed at an imaginary watch in his celebration, a nod to Olmo who regularly produces the same gesture after scoring.At the other end Inaki Williams dallied on the ball too long as Athletic's best attacking move of the first half broke down.Yamal, returning after an ankle problem, should have added Barcelona's second after Raphinha's shot was saved but the 17-year-old miscued an attempted lob.Wojciech Szczesny, on his second start in goal for Barcelona, made a good save to keep Inaki Williams at bay before the break.Barcelona doubled their lead early in the second half when Gavi slipped in Yamal who finished with aplomb.Veteran Polish forward Robert Lewandowski spurned a fine chance to add the third, firing off-target when well placed.Athletic coach Ernesto Valverde, who was sacked as Barcelona boss after a defeat at the same stadium in 2020, brought on Nico Williams to try and turn the game around.The Spain international, heavily linked with Barcelona in the summer, was not fit enough to start, but made a positive impact from the bench.The winger set up Oscar de Marcos to strike but the Athletic defender had strayed just offside and the goal was ruled out.Inaki Williams also had a goal ruled out for offside after Frenkie De Jong's poor back-pass took a slight deflection off Alvaro Djalo on its way to the Ghana international.""It's a shame given all the effort... but we have good things ahead of us and we have to continue,"" said Inaki Williams.Barcelona were able to book their place in Sunday's final, in which Olmo will be allowed to feature.""We don't care (who we face in the final), it will be hard and we want to win it, which is the important thing, and go back home with the trophy,"" said Yamal.",Barcelona beat Athletic Bilbao 2-0 in the Spanish Super Cup semi-final.

Slot frustrated

London: Lucas Bergvall condemned Liverpool to only their second defeat this season as the teenager's late strike earned Tottenham a controversial 1-0 win in the League Cup semi-final first leg on Wednesday.Bergvall struck with just four minutes left in north London, but Liverpool boss Arne Slot was furious that the Swede was still on the pitch to score his first goal for Tottenham.Already on a yellow card, the 18-year-old had escaped a second booking moments earlier after tripping Kostas Tsimikas.Tsimikas was out of position after the tackle when Bergvall scored from an attack that started on the left flank vacated by the Liverpool defender.Tottenham's victory was a welcome tonic for Rodrigo Bentancur , who was taken to hospital after suffering a worrying injury.Bentancur stooped to head a corner in the seventh minute and stayed on the ground after falling unchallenged.His team-mates showed immediate concern and play was stopped as Bentancur received medical attention for nine minutes.The 27-year-old was given oxygen through a mask during the treatment as a hush fell on the capacity crowd.At half-time, Tottenham moved to ease fears over Uruguay star Bentancur, who only recently returned from a seven-game ban for using a racial slur about team-mate Son Heung-min.""We can confirm Rodrigo is conscious, talking and will go to hospital for further checks,"" the club said in a statement on X during the half-time interval.Responding to criticism of Tottenham's spluttering form and his attacking tactics, Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou claimed earlier this term that he always wins a trophy in his second season.The under-fire Australian could do with backing up that boast given Tottenham's poor form in the Premier League.Tottenham last won a trophy when they lifted the League Cup in 2008 and the competition is shaping up as an opportunity to end that long silverware drought.Liverpool won the League Cup last season in what proved to be Jurgen Klopp's last trophy.Slot has taken Liverpool to the top of the Premier League and the Champions League since replacing Klopp, making this a rare flop from the Reds under the Dutchman.It was Liverpool's first defeat in 24 games in all competitions since a 1-0 loss to Nottingham Forest in the league in September.That was the only other loss endured by Slot this season and, following Sunday's disappointing 2-2 draw with lowly Manchester United, he is facing the first test of his prolonged honeymoon period on Merseyside.The second leg at Anfield on February 6 will decide who advances to the final.Newcastle won 2-0 at Arsenal in the first leg of the other semi-final on Tuesday.Postecoglou had handed a debut to goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky, who replaced injured duo Guglielmo Vicario and Fraser Forster after signing from Slavia Prague in a £12 million ($14 million) deal at the weekend.With Liverpool well below their best, the 21-year-old Czech wasn't forced into action until late in the first half when he held on to Alexis Mac Allister's header.Slot grew frustrated with Liverpool's miscues, gesticulating at his backroom staff after Cody Gakpo's shot was saved by Kinsky.There was more angst for Slot when keeper Alisson Becker turned an ambitious turn inside his own area, allowing Bergvall to steal possession and start an attack that ended with Pedro Porro chipping just wide.Slot sent on Trent Alexander-Arnold and he almost made an instant impact with a shot that was cleared off the line by Radu Dragusin.Darwin Nunez, another of Slot's substitutes, was denied by a fine save from Kinsky.Bergvall escaped a red card before snatching his priceless winner in the 86th minute.Dominic Solanke showed impressive strength and determination to hold off Ibrahima Konate, laying a pass into the path of Bergvall, who slammed low past Alisson.Kinsky made a superb stop to repel Nunez's agile back-flick in stoppage-time as Postecoglou finally enjoyed a night to savour.",Tottenham beat Liverpool 1-0 in the first leg of the League Cup semi-final.

Real Madrid 's manager Carlo Ancelotti expressed his disagreement with the two-match suspension given to Vinicius Junior following his dismissal in the Valencia match in La Liga .The Brazilian forward received a red card during Madrid's 2-1 win on Friday after pushing Valencia goalkeeper Stole Dimitrievski on the neck from behind.Whilst Vinicius will miss upcoming league fixtures against Las Palmas and Real Valladolid in January, he remains available for selection in the Spanish Super Cup this week.""Both he and I hear what happens in the stadiums, the insults... the ban is not right,"" Ancelotti stated to journalists in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, before Madrid's semi-final against Mallorca.The forward faced hostile reception from Valencia supporters at their Mestalla stadium, the same venue where he confronted fans who directed racial abuse at him in 2022.On Wednesday, La Liga submitted a report to the Spanish football federation's anti-violence committee regarding Valencia supporters chanting ""stupid, stupid"" at Vinicius.""I'm tired because when people talk about Vinicius provoking (people), they're deflecting from the insults he receives from everyone,"" Ancelotti continued, responding to queries about the player's constant media attention.""We are delighted with Vinicius in all ways.""The Spanish Super Cup semi-finals feature Barcelona against Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday, followed by European champions Madrid facing Mallorca.",Carlo Ancelotti has expressed his disagreement with Vinicius Junior's two-match suspension.

West Ham dismissed Julen Lopetegui on Wednesday following a brief 22-match stint, with Graham Potter , previously of Chelsea, anticipated to take the helm at the London Stadium.The club sits 14th in the Premier League , maintaining a seven-point cushion above the relegation places, having secured only six victories in 20 league fixtures under the Spanish manager's leadership.A decisive 4-1 defeat to Manchester City on Saturday prompted the club's leadership to take action.""The first half of the 2024/25 season has not aligned with the club's ambitions and the club has therefore taken action in line with its objectives,"" West Ham announced officially.They added: ""The board would like to thank Julen and his staff for their hard work during their time with the Hammers and wish them every success for the future.""West Ham invested substantially during the summer transfer window, allocating approximately £125 million on acquisitions including Max Kilman, Crysencio Summerville and Niclas Fullkrug.Lopetegui's tenure was marked by poor results, winning just once in his initial six league matches and enduring significant defeats, including a 5-2 loss to Arsenal and a 5-0 defeat against Liverpool at home.The 58-year-old, with previous experience at Real Madrid and Spain, succeeded David Moyes in May, following the Scot's departure after his second stint with the London club.Moyes had guided West Ham to European competition for three successive seasons, culminating in the 2023 Europa Conference League victory, the club's first major honour in 43 years.Upon his appointment, Lopetegui, who had previously managed Wolves, expressed his enthusiasm, stating he had alternative options but was ""very happy that West Ham chose me because I chose West Ham too"".The club's search for Lopetegui's successor reportedly included discussions with former AC Milan manager Paulo Fonseca and previous Paris St-Germain head coach Christophe Galtier.Potter, 49, has been inactive since departing Chelsea in April 2023, where he achieved 12 victories in 31 matches during his abbreviated tenure of a five-year contract.His managerial journey began at Swedish side Ostersund, followed by productive periods at Swansea and Brighton before his Chelsea appointment.West Ham's next fixture is an FA Cup third round match against Aston Villa on Friday.Lopetegui becomes the fifth Premier League manager dismissed this season, following Erik ten Hag, Steve Cooper, Gary O'Neil and Russell Martin.","West Ham dismiss Julen Lopetegui after just 22 matches in charge of the club.

The League Cup organisers have mocked Mikel Arteta after the Arsenal manager blamed the ""tricky"" match ball for his team's loss against Newcastle.Newcastle United secured a significant advantage towards reaching the Wembley final with a 2-0 victory in the semi-final first leg at the Emirates on Tuesday, with Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon finding the net.Despite Arsenal's 23 attempts at goal, only three were on target, with notable misses from Gabriel Martinelli and Kai Havertz. The competition uses Puma balls, whilst the Premier League employs Nike balls.Arteta commented on the ball's behaviour, stating: ""We kicked a lot of balls over the bar. It's tricky. This ball flies a lot. It's just very different to the Premier League ball and we have to adapt to that. It flies different, and the grip is very different as well.""Arsenal had previously scored 11 goals in their three League Cup matches this season before this semi-final first leg.The Carabao Cup 's social media account, with approximately 600,000 followers, shared Arteta's post-match comments about the ball alongside a meme featuring US rapper 50 Cent displaying a bewildered expression, seemingly criticising the Arsenal manager's remarks.The victorious team from this tie, concluding at St James' Park on February 5, will face either Tottenham or Liverpool at Wembley.Arteta faces mounting expectations to secure his second trophy as Arsenal's manager, following his FA Cup triumph in his inaugural season.Arsenal, currently second in the Premier League, are set to host Manchester United in the FA Cup third round on Sunday.",Arsenal lost 2-0 to Newcastle in the League Cup semi-final first leg on Tuesday.
