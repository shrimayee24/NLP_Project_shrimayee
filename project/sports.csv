Asia Cup press conference: Suryakumar Yadav on playing Pakistan, Sanju Samson, India Playing XI

Poll Who was the standout performer for India against UAE? Kuldeep Yadav Jasprit Bumrah

NEW DELHI: In a rare incident during the Asia Cup 2025 clash between India and UAE at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Wednesday, UAE batter Junaid Siddique was initially given out after a sharp direct throw from India’s wicketkeeper Sanju Samson found him short of the crease. However, Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav chose to withdraw the appeal when Siddique pointed out that bowler Shivam Dube’s towel had slipped from his waistband during the run-up.The unusual moment came in the 13th over when Siddique attempted a wild swing at Dube’s short-pitched delivery. Replays from the third umpire confirmed that his foot was outside the crease, and the “OUT” signal was flashed on the big screen before India opted to overturn the appeal.The gesture did not impact the match result, as UAE were bundled out for just 57 runs soon after.Kuldeep Yadav, returning to white-ball action after warming the bench during India’s five-Test tour of England, was the star with the ball. The left-arm spinner demolished the UAE batting order with sensational figures of 4 for 7 in just 2.1 overs.Jasprit Bumrah set the tone for India’s dominance, removing Kerala-born opener Alishan Sharafu with a pinpoint yorker.Sharafu had top-scored for UAE with 22 off 17 balls, including three fours and a six, before Bumrah’s lethal delivery ended his innings. Once Sharafu departed, the UAE batting line-up collapsed swiftly, with wickets tumbling in quick succession.Chasing a modest target of 58, India cruised to a 9-wicket win, starting their Asia Cup 2025 campaign in emphatic fashion.India will next face arch-rivals Pakistan on Sunday in Dubai, a contest already billed as the marquee clash of the group stage.","India beat UAE by nine wickets in their Asia Cup 2025 opener.

“As a society, we must be reminded that human life is sacred and never disposable.

We must learn again to disagree with words, not weapons.

Jesus does. And because of Him, Charlie’s voice still echoes — calling us to live with conviction, courage, and hope.

Well done good and faithful servant.”

Brooks Nader caught in a love triangle with Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner



Brooks Nader’s history of messy romances keeps her in headlines



Sports Illustrated swimsuit model and reality star Brooks Nader has turned the US Open into more than just a battle of rackets. According to reports, she found herself in a love triangle with champion Carlos Alcaraz and runner-up Jannik Sinner, dating both stars at the same time. The plotline, ripped straight from Zendaya’s movie Challengers, has quickly become one of the most talked-about off-court storylines in tennis.The speculation began when Brooks’ sister, Grace Ann, revealed on Page Six Radio that her sibling was juggling “a little roster” of athletes. She teased one name that “rhymes with winner,” leaving fans convinced Jannik Sinner was involved. Brooks, clearly flustered, threatened to “punch” her sister for spilling secrets, but by then the gossip had taken off.Soon after, late-night host Jimmy Kimmel pressed Brooks about Sinner, and her coy response only fueled rumors. “Is this, like, an interrogation? I’m so scared right now… You’re close. You’re warm,” she teased. But the real twist came when she was spotted courtside, cheering for Carlos Alcaraz during his semifinal and final matches. Days later, Grace Ann confirmed, “The rumors are true,” adding, “Dating is such a loose term.But I do know he’s the man of the hour.”While many fans labeled the situation “dramatic,” others pointed out the double standard: men in the sports world often date multiple women without scrutiny. If no commitment has been made, Nader is free to explore her options — even if those options happen to be the top two tennis players in the world.This isn’t the first time Nader’s love life has made waves. Earlier this year, she split from Dancing with the Stars pro Gleb Savchenko, who claimed he only learned of the breakup through the press. She also admitted in January that she’s “still legally married” to William Haire, despite announcing their separation in 2024.From Tom Brady dating rumors to a Hulu reality series, Brooks Nader has mastered the art of staying in the spotlight. And now, with Alcaraz and Sinner in the mix, her off-court roster is making nearly as many headlines as the athletes themselves.Also Read: Ronika Love proves she’s Jordan Love’s biggest supporter with bold game-day look before Packers vs Commanders showdown","Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Brooks Nader is in a love triangle, according to reports.

Kyle Kuzma’s lavish proposal set the tone for their future together



Winnie Harlow isn’t rushing to the altar, but she is giving fans a rare peek at where things stand with her wedding to Milwaukee Bucks forward Kyle Kuzma. Nearly seven months after the couple’s romantic engagement in Turks and Caicos, the model admitted the pair are still sorting through details— most importantly, the location. For Harlow, it’s less about grandeur and more about the vibe she wants their big day to capture.Speaking at The Kering Foundation’s Caring for Women dinner in New York City on Sept. 11, Harlow admitted the destination is the couple’s biggest question mark right now. “At this point, we're trying to get to a point of where,” she told E! News. “And then we can get everything flowing.”Though undecided on the venue, the model already knows what kind of bride she will be. “I'm an island vibe,” she said. “So, I really want to have warm weather, and I want to have a lot of dancing. I'm that type.”Harlow’s vision reflects the personality she’s shared throughout her career. From her breakthrough on America’s Next Top Model to her success in fashion and business with her skincare line, Cay Skin, she has leaned into confidence and individuality over the years. In a recent interview with Us Weekly, she credited her grandmother as a lasting influence.“My grandmother is such a fiery Jamaican Leo, just like me, and she has always been confident,” Harlow said, recalling how her bold sense of style inspired her growing up.Her relationship with Kuzma went public in 2020. Even though the two are still early in wedding planning, Harlow recently shared that she doesn’t feel pressure to move quickly. “So many people ask me about the engagement and when the wedding is and you know what? I don't want to rush anything,” she said. “I want to do everything perfect and the way I want to do it. So whatever time that takes, whatever things that take, I just want to relish in this moment. ”Their engagement was nothing short of cinematic. Kuzma whisked Harlow away on a Valentine’s Day trip that included a private jet decked out with roses, balloons, and chocolates. What Harlow thought was just an extravagant getaway ended with a surprise proposal. “You threw me off the scent,” she told Kuzma during a Vogue interview.The Bucks forward capped off the night with a heartfelt poem that ended with the line, “Will you be my wife?” For Harlow, the moment was both shocking and perfect. “For a split second in my head I thought, ‘This would be so cute if this was an engagement,’” she recalled.Kuzma had also designed the 8.5-carat oval-cut diamond ring himself, choosing a style he described as “elegant, but very timeless and simplistic.” Reflecting on the proposal, Harlow said, “We’re over the moon.”Also Read: Ayesha and Stephen Curry spotted at US Open and strolling through New York City",Winnie Harlow and Kyle Kuzma are still deciding on a location for their wedding.

For a moment, it looked like the offense would lose one of its most reliable weapons. But by the end of the night, fans breathed easier with good news—Kraft returned to the field.The third-year tight end appeared shaken up while running a route on the Packers’ second drive. He gingerly walked off under his own power and did not immediately return, sparking concern on the sidelines. While he didn’t enter the medical tent, the momentary absence was enough to raise eyebrows given his growing importance in Green Bay’s passing game.Before the injury, Kraft was already showcasing his value. He connected with quarterback Jordan Love on a 57-yard strike that electrified the offense and later added another catch, bringing his total to 72 yards in the opening minutes. For Love, who continues to build chemistry with his receivers, Kraft has become a dependable safety valve, particularly in red zone opportunities.Compounding the tension, wide receiver Jayden Reed also suffered a shoulder injury earlier in the matchup, leaving the Packers’ offense suddenly short-handed.In such a scenario, Kraft’s potential absence could have been devastating. Fortunately for Green Bay, he was cleared to return and rejoined his teammates in the next offensive series.For fantasy football managers, the brief scare was a reminder of how pivotal Tucker Kraft has become. Entering his third season, Kraft had already proven his worth last year with 50 receptions, 707 yards, and a team-high seven touchdowns. Many expected him to build on that momentum in 2025, and his hot start against Washington suggested just that.If the injury had lingered, Luke Musgrave would likely have stepped in as the primary tight end. While Musgrave has streaming upside, Kraft’s production and consistency have cemented him as the true TE1. His quick return Thursday night signals relief for both the Packers and fantasy managers counting on his continued rise.Also Read: Vikings star Justin Jefferson drops heartfelt message to JJ McCarthy amid exciting baby news and practice absence","The Green Bay Packers had an early scare when tight end Tucker Kraft exited with an apparent lower-body injury during the first quarter.

Tom Brady says he loves that visible emotion

Passion sharpened McCarthy’s focus in crunch time

Energy that lifted teammates in biggest moments

A Michigan man earning legendary quarterback’s approval

J.J. McCarthy’s first NFL start looked like it might unravel after three uneven quarters and a pick-six that left Minnesota fans deflated. But the 22-year-old quarterback transformed nerves into resilience, rallying the Vikings with a 21-point fourth quarter to shock the Bears. The comeback was impressive, but what resonated most was the rookie’s raw passion — something that struck a chord with Tom Brady.Appearing on Colin Cowherd’s show, Brady honed in on the rookie’s fire. “I absolutely love it when I see that type of emotion,” the seven-time Super Bowl winner said. “I think it brings you to a higher level of focus.” For Brady, emotion wasn’t a weakness — it was the sharp edge that separates ordinary quarterbacks from leaders who rise in defining moments.Brady explained that McCarthy’s emotional surge wasn’t reckless but purposeful. “When you’re electrified as a player, you play with the most focus, the most anticipation. Everything ends up being at the highest sense of alertness,” he noted. That ability to turn adrenaline into poise, Brady suggested, is what allowed McCarthy to flip the game after three rough quarters.Beyond mechanics, Brady admired how McCarthy’s passion spread to others.“I believe it’s part of your conditioning—that ability to elevate your teammates as well in those big moments,” he said. For a young quarterback, earning belief in the huddle is half the battle. McCarthy’s energy, Brady argued, didn’t just save a game — it made the Vikings rally around him.Brady ended his reflection with pride in their shared roots. “I love seeing that in a Michigan man,” he said, tying McCarthy’s fight to the Wolverines’ long-standing tradition of grit. For the Vikings, those words weren’t just compliments — they were validation from football’s ultimate standard-bearer. McCarthy may only be one start into his journey, but with Brady’s seal of approval, his passion already feels like a weapon built for the big stage.Also read: Chiefs Style Lounge 2025 brings high-fashion runway glam to Arrowhead Stadium for fans",Tom Brady says he loves that visible emotion from J.J.

What happened to Jayden Reed?



Why Jayden Reed’s injury matters for Packers’ playoff hopes



For a brief moment on Thursday night, it looked like Jayden Reed was going to set the tone for the Green Bay Packers. The second-year receiver hauled in what appeared to be a spectacular 39-yard touchdown on the opening drive against the Washington Commanders. But in a matter of seconds, the momentum—and the Packers’ optimism—came crashing down.Reed’s highlight catch didn’t stand, as a holding penalty on Anthony Belton erased the score. Far worse, Reed fell awkwardly on his right shoulder as Commanders safety Quan Martin finished the play. He remained on the ground in visible pain before heading to the locker room, his right arm dangling at his side. The Packers later announced he was questionable to return with a shoulder injury.This setback adds to Reed’s recent struggles with injuries. Coming into the season, he was already nursing a Jones fracture in his foot. Now, the talented wideout faces another obstacle just as he was emerging as Jordan Love’s most reliable target. Losing Reed, especially in a game where the Packers were already down two starting offensive linemen, could not have come at a worse time.The Packers entered this season with Super Bowl ambitions, fueled by the blockbuster addition of Micah Parsons and the rapid development of Jordan Love.But even with star power at multiple positions, the receiver room remained the biggest unknown. Reed was expected to shoulder that responsibility, quickly stepping into a WR1 role thanks to his speed, route running, and big-play ability.Without Reed, Green Bay’s offense looks significantly thinner. Christian Watson remains sidelined, and while Romeo Doubs, Dontayvion Wicks, and rookie Matthew Golden offer depth, none carry Reed’s explosive impact. Against a disciplined Commanders defense, Jordan Love will need to elevate his game, spreading the ball creatively to keep the chains moving.For now, Green Bay fans can only hope Reed’s shoulder injury isn’t severe. In a season built on high expectations, losing their brightest young receiver for an extended stretch would be a devastating blow to their championship pursuit.Also Read: Chiefs rookie Xavier Worthy hints at surprise recovery timeline with cryptic post before Super Bowl rematch","Green Bay Packers wideout Jayden Reed suffered a shoulder injury against the Washington Commanders.

Deebo Samuel’s versatility gives the Commanders a dynamic edge

Why the 49ers were willing to part ways with Deebo Samuel

When the Washington Commanders acquired Deebo Samuel from the San Francisco 49ers, it immediately shook the NFL landscape. The move wasn’t just about adding a top-tier wide receiver—it was a strategic play designed to reshape Washington’s offense around young quarterback Jayden Daniels . For a team seeking identity and playmaking versatility, Samuel’s arrival is a game-changing moment.Deebo Samuel isn’t your typical wide receiver. “He’s a chess piece who can line up outside, in the slot, or even in the backfield,” a source notes, highlighting the unique threat he poses to opposing defenses. Offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury thrives on this kind of flexibility, and pairing Samuel with Terry McLaurin instantly gives Daniels two proven stars capable of making explosive plays from any position on the field.The trade also carried a personal connection: Washington GM Adam Peters helped draft Samuel in 2019 and had firsthand knowledge of the talent and character he brings. After finalizing the deal, the Commanders reworked Samuel’s contract, guaranteeing his salary while adding performance incentives—a move that reflects their confidence in him and sets him up for a motivated contract year.San Francisco’s decision to trade Samuel stemmed from practicality rather than lack of talent.After requesting a trade post-2024, Samuel sought a fresh start following injury setbacks and a dip in production. The 49ers also needed cap space for extensions for Brock Purdy, Nick Bosa, and Christian McCaffrey. Trading Samuel allowed them to focus on younger receivers like Ricky Pearsall while balancing long-term roster needs.Also Read: Packers vs Commanders: Micah Parsons set for bigger role despite injury concerns For Washington, the payoff was immediate. In Week 1, Samuel recorded 96 scrimmage yards, a 19-yard touchdown run, and 50 kick return yards, fueling a 220-yard rushing day—the kind of impact the Commanders hoped for. This trade signals Washington’s intent: they’re serious about building a high-powered offense and giving Jayden Daniels the weapons to thrive.","The Washington Commanders acquired Deebo Samuel from the San Francisco 49ers.

NFL legend Rob Gronkowski is raising eyebrows with a blunt assessment of the Kansas City Chiefs. After the Philadelphia Eagles’ Super Bowl LIX victory, he warns that Patrick Mahomes ’ team may be vulnerable, pointing to both on-field strategies and troubling sideline tensions that could signal a rough 2025 season ahead for Kansas City.NFL legend Rob Gronkowski, a four-time Super Bowl champion, has sounded the alarm for the Kansas City Chiefs. After observing the Philadelphia Eagles’ dominant 40-22 Super Bowl LIX victory over the Chiefs, Gronkowski believes the Eagles have revealed a strategy that could trouble Patrick Mahomes’ squad moving forward.""The Philadelphia Eagles opened that floodgate of, ‘Hey, if you punch these guys in the face, you take it to them, you come out swinging, they’re gonna fold and they’re not gonna be the team you were seeing all last year,’"" he explained on Up & Adams.The Chiefs’ early struggles this season seem to support Gronkowski’s concerns. Following their Super Bowl defeat, Kansas City also lost their season opener to AFC West rival Los Angeles Chargers in São Paulo, Brazil, 27-21. Justin Herbert had a career-defining performance, exploiting weaknesses in the Chiefs’ defensive line.Gronkowski highlighted another worrying factor: the Chiefs’ internal dynamics. A sideline altercation between defensive stars Chris Jones and Drue Tranquill during a timeout raised red flags.""What I was surprised about is when things aren’t going their way, as you can see, when they start struggling a little bit, they start yelling at each other,"" Gronkowski said.He added, ""The blame game starts going on. You can see it on the sidelines. And that’s not a good situation. You want to come together when you’re down, when things aren’t going your way.

Xavier Worthy injury update brings optimism for Chiefs



Chiefs need Xavier Worthy healthy for long-term success



The Kansas City Chiefs received a major boost this week as wide receiver Xavier Worthy returned to practice, less than two weeks after suffering a right shoulder injury in the season opener. While the 22-year-old rookie is pushing for an early comeback, the team appears set on taking a cautious approach with its rising star.Worthy’s participation in Thursday’s practice surprised many, given the initial concerns surrounding his shoulder. He was injured during Kansas City’s Week 1 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers after colliding with teammate Travis Kelce on the first drive. Fortunately, surgery and injured reserve were avoided, with reports now suggesting he could be back as early as Week 3 against the New York Giants.Still, Worthy has made it clear he is eager to suit up. On Thursday, he posted a picture of himself in uniform to Instagram with the caption “Free 1,” a message fans interpreted as a plea to play against the Philadelphia Eagles this Sunday. The Chiefs’ medical staff, however, may have the final word.His potential absence is significant. With Rashee Rice serving a six-game suspension, Kansas City can ill afford to lose its top two receivers. Patrick Mahomes needs weapons, and Worthy’s ability to stretch defenses was evident last season when he posted 638 yards and six touchdowns as a rookie.His playoff surge, highlighted by an electric 157-yard, two-touchdown Super Bowl performance, cemented his status as a game-changer.Even if Worthy sits out this week, the Chiefs know his return will be crucial for the season’s trajectory. The franchise invested heavily when they drafted him in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft, and his chemistry with Mahomes already shows signs of blossoming.Kansas City faces the Eagles on Sunday in a Super Bowl LIX rematch. While fans would love to see Worthy back on the field, protecting his health remains the priority. The Chiefs have a long season ahead, and rushing their star receiver could risk more than it rewards. For now, optimism remains—Worthy looks closer than anyone expected to being back in action.Also Read: “Yelling at each other”: Rob Gronkowski claims Chiefs are falling apart after Eagles expose Patrick Mahomes’ weaknesses","Xavier Worthy returned to practice for the first time since suffering a shoulder injury in the season opener.

J.J. McCarthy and Katya Kuropas are having a whirlwind journey



The Minnesota Vikings couldn’t have scripted a better opening to the 2025 season. Quarterback J.J. McCarthy, making his long-awaited debut after missing all of 2024 with a meniscus injury, led a dramatic fourth-quarter comeback to beat the Chicago Bears 27-24 on Monday Night Football. But while his heroics earned him NFL Offensive Player of the Week, McCarthy’s biggest victory is happening off the field — the imminent birth of his first child.After shaking off early-game jitters that included a costly pick-six, McCarthy showed the poise that convinced the Vikings to draft him 10th overall in 2024. In the final 15 minutes, he threw two touchdown passes and added a rushing score, igniting U.S. Bank Stadium and stamping his name on the league’s radar. Head coach Kevin O’Connell called the performance “a glimpse of what’s to come,” reaffirming his long-term faith in the young quarterback.Just days later, McCarthy skipped Thursday’s practice for the best reason possible. According to Vikings insider Alec Lewis of The Athletic, the quarterback was at a local hospital with his fiancée, Katya Kuropas, as they awaited the birth of their son. O’Connell couldn’t hide his joy, saying he was “pumped to share the news” with the team.Star wideout Justin Jefferson added his own heartfelt message, but with a playful reminder of what lies ahead:“If you seeing this now, congratulations my boy, congratulations. I’m excited for him for this new chapter, this new journey. But after you get done, come on back!”For McCarthy and Kuropas, this milestone comes after years of shared highs and lows. From winning the 2024 National Championship with Michigan, to enduring a season-ending NFL injury before taking his first snap, the couple has weathered the rollercoaster together. This week, however, has brought nothing but joy — a comeback victory, national recognition, and the start of a new chapter in parenthood.The Vikings face the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday Night Football, and McCarthy is expected to return before kickoff. Whether on the field or in the delivery room, one thing is clear: J.J. McCarthy’s week is nothing short of unforgettable.Also Read: Packers’ Jayden Reed suffers concerning injury against Commanders, immediate updates on wide receiver’s Week 2 status","Minnesota Vikings quarterback J.J.

Anthony Martial is set to join Monterrey as per several reports (Screengrab)

Poll Do you think Anthony Martial will be a success at Monterrey? Yes, definitely No, not at all

Anthony Martial is on the verge of a move to Liga MX side Monterrey, with reports suggesting the French forward has agreed terms and will undergo a medical in Mexico.The 29-year-old, released by Manchester United at the end of the 2023/24 season, had joined AEK Athens on a free transfer last summer. Despite being handed what was described as the biggest contract in the Greek club’s history, Martial struggled to make an impact, featuring in just 24 games across competitions. He has not been included in the squad for AEK’s last six fixtures.Transfer journalist Fabrizio Romano reported that Monterrey and Martial have reached an agreement, with the move pending medical clearance. Fellow Mexican side Pumas were also in the race but failed to finalise a deal after Martial declined to lower his wage demands.As per reports from journalist Cesar Luis Merlo, AEK were willing to loan him to Pumas free of charge (they should only pay his salary), but Martial earns a massive salary.Martial, who joined United from Monaco in 2015 for an initial £36m, went on to score 90 goals in 317 appearances for the Premier League club. His imminent switch to Monterrey comes just months after the Mexican side secured the signing of former Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos.Should the move go through, Martial will link up with the 39-year-old veteran, who has already helped Monterrey climb to the top of the Liga MX standings with six wins from their opening seven matches.","Anthony Martial is on the verge of a move to Monterrey, according to reports.

Pittsburgh Steelers veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers ’ former partners—Shailene Woodley, Olivia Munn , and Danica Patrick—have shared powerful excerpts from their past relationships, including phrases like “Depression would come,” “Dangerous to my psyche,” and “Emotionally abusive. ” Thanks to the podcast world, women have started expressing themselves beyond the fear of judgment. Let’s gauge through the emotions each of these women went through when they were in a relationship with the Ayahuasca Retreat lover, Aaron Rodgers.Shailene Woodley described her relationship with former Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers in an interview with Melissa Johnson ofMagazine.actress said she had lost herself completely. She said she understood what anxiety and depression truly were. Her stylist, Kris Zero, would try her level best to keep theactress occupied, but she would feel depressed again.“I haven’t shared much about my relationship with Aaron(Rodgers) because it always makes me cry. It was not right. But it was beautiful. I had a really awful, traumatic thing happen in early 2022.I felt like I lost my soul, my self, my happiness, my joy. I really understood depression and anxiety, and like, complete soul detachment.”She chose to remain in a toxic situation because she was empathizing with someone else.“Empathy kind of kept me in this loop of feeling everything for everyone. I knew I was depressed when I looked at a tree and felt nothing. That was the lowest low of my life.”Shailene Woodley’s stylist, Kris Zero, would wake her up with blasting music just to get her out of bed. “Sometimes I was so angry at her. But then we’d go surf, and for ten minutes that day, I thought life could be okay again.Then the depression would come back, and she’d out–We’re volunteering at the horse ranch! – and we’d find a random f*cking horse ranch and we’d clean up horse sh*t.We’d clean hooves and brush the horses, and for 20 minutes that day, I thought like could be okay again. And then depression came back, and she’d wake up the next morning and go–Let’s go on a hike and bring trash bags and clean up trash!”Melissa reported that after about six months, the depression started to fade.Olivia Munn, theactress, appeared on thepodcast, where she talked about a past relationship in which she felt trapped in a tumultuous family dynamic. She said that her therapist encouraged her to stay in the relationship that she wanted to get out of.“I had a therapist who I really loved, and I know that she cared about me, or at least I thought she did. I would constantly, from the very beginning, say–I don’t know about this, I don’t think this is the right(relationship), I want to get out. I gotta get out,” Munn said.Theactress said her therapist encouraged her to stay in that relationship. “She thought that my ‘picker’ was off, and she would look at it as: this person on paper looked great. And when there was couples therapy, they knew how to present the right way. Then the stories I would tell seemed unbelievable.From that experience, learning that I gotta go with my gut and I gotta be decisive with some things if it’s coming from a place where I want to survive, and I realize that I’m not happy, and that days and weeks and months go by of unhappiness and fear.I don’t know if there’s a word to describe what that relationship was like. It was without a doubt the hardest period of my life, being in that,” she said she felt “really trapped in a tumultuous family dynamic.”Munn further said that the relationship taught her to stand up for herself. “It taught me how to stand up and fight for myself, so that was great. I truly had no idea that I could be manipulated and hurt that way, that I wouldn’t just get out of something that was dangerous to my psyche.It’s not just the period that you’re with the person, but, if you’re lucky to get out, (it’s) the years of healing yourself afterwards,” Munn told Lewinsky.She further shared, “The catalyst was getting out of a relationship that had drained me and left me just really...it's hard, I don't know if there's a word to describe it what that relationship was like...it was, without a doubt, the hardest period of my life, being in that.”Danica Patrick, the former professional racing driver and model, appeared onpodcast, where she disclosed that she was in an emotionally abusive relationship with the 41-year-old quarterback, Aaron Rodgers.“The breakup with Aaron(Rodgers) in 2020—because it was sudden, it felt like it was my life. When you live with somebody, it’s your whole life—your dentist appointments, your hairdo, your clothes, your mailing address, everything. Because the nature of the relationship was emotionally abusive, it wore me down to nothing.Something that people could never imagine is that I would lack any confidence or belief in the simple things about who I am. Everything was torn to bits.He leaves a trail of blood. I don’t think I’m saying too much earth-shattering stuff; there’s been enough out there.But it gave me the greatest gift, which was myself—how much I needed to show up for myself, take care of myself,” Patrick told Sage Steele.The former IndyCar Series and NASCAR driver said she felt like she was built for hard things when she was in a relationship with Rodgers,“Hindsight, I ignored it(emotionally abusive relationship), but in real life, it was just like, I would say all the time—I’m built for hard things. I can handle hard things. And so, I just saw it as a hard thing, and my nature is to try harder and do more.What if I don't do it for the right person? What if I get too proud and go like—I'm just I'm done. Instead of going—Man, just try a little harder. What if you look back and think—Man, I wish I would have tried. I would never want that in my life. I wish I would have tried. This is probably why I don't have regret and I don't have shame.”","Aaron Rodgers’ former partners have shared powerful excerpts from their past relationships, including phrases like “Depression would come,” “Dangerous to my psyche,’ and “Emotionally abusive.” Thanks to the podcast world, women have started expressing themselves beyond the fear of judgment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123764899,imgsize-3192143,width-400,resizemode-4/nfl-aaron-rodgers.jpg"

The Edmonton Oilers had ended the offseason with an excruciating loss in the 2024-25 Stanley Cup Final and were defeated by Florida Panthers in Game 7. This was the second Final the team had in recent years and this was a defeat, which showed how far of a ways this team struggles to win a championship.The constraint of low salary cap space and the park already having veteran players with high salaries meant that this was the time to look inside the organization to grow and produce your own talent. The comments made by Captain Connor McDavid after the Final created a simple expectation to the organization emphasizing on self conduction rather than add new people.After the Game 7 loss at Amerant Bank Arena in Sunrise, Florida, McDavid spoke to reporters during a post-game press conference. This was the first time the team's leadership publicly commented on the defeat and what lies ahead. While addressing the gathered media, which included folks from NHL.com, CBC, and the Edmonton Journal, McDavid showed his frustration but also his determination. He stated, ""Everyone’s got to find a new level. It’s not like we have a ton of cap room and we got a long list of highly touted prospects knocking on the door.""This statement was included in a wider contemplation about the season, with McDavid noting the team's impressive play while highlighting the necessity for individual improvement to break through their current barriers.Edmonton came back from a 3-0 series deficit against Florida, pushing it to a crucial Game 7, but ended up losing 2-1. McDavid, who snagged the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP even in defeat, pointed out the team's limitations due to the NHL salary cap, which was around $92.5 million for the 2025-26 season.With key players like McDavid (cap hit of $12.5 million), Leon Draisaitl ($14 million), and Darnell Nurse ($9.25 million) consuming a large portion of the salary cap, there were restrictions on major free-agent acquisitions. McDavid pointed out that any enhancements need to arise from the current team and new talent, rather than depending on trades or signings.It was also with this opening statement that the silence of the team was broken regarding the loss, as the disappointing side of the story was transformed into a suitorial one. It found expression in subsequent group missives, in which McDavid stressed, ""I know that's cliché, but it's true. Everyone's got to find a new level. It's not like we have a ton of cap room, and we've got a long list of highly touted prospects knocking on the door. ""As the offseason dragged on, we received more information on the strategy of the team as McDavid has urged the team to improve internally. In 2025, aiming at preventing another disaster, Oilers GM, Stan Bowman was a guest on Overdrive on the radio of the sound OFF TSN 1050 in Toronto, where the program was hosted by Bryan Hayes, Jeff O'Neill, and Jamie McLennan. In this radio discussion Bowman expressed how people should do this talent building internally just as McDavid had earlier said.He stated, ""We didn’t see a lot of growth from within, so the players who were good in November were good again in April."" Bowman discussed this within the case of the 2024-25 season whereby the team is heavy on its senior players, which did not give young players a chance to grow and play mid-season.Bowman's observations shed more light on the organization's approach. He highlighted the need for patience with new members while urging them to step into more significant roles, mentioning, ""We’re going to have to work with them and be patient but also help them come along so that they can add something to the mix."".This was set against the history of previous seasons when players like Evan Bouchard took a long time to land a top-four defense position, while others like Philip Broberg moved on through an offer sheet because of not enough ice time. Bowman also talked about adding to the roster at the trade deadline but emphasized that it shouldn't be the only way to make improvements.The interview showcased particular prospects that are expected to boost this internal growth. As per NHL.com's 32-in-32 prospect rankings published on August 10, 2025, the top prospects for the Oilers are:Other names mentioned include David Tomasek, Atro Leppanen, Alec Regula, and Samuel Jonsson, who were highlighted in prospect breakdowns by Daily Faceoff on July 21, 2025, as potential contenders for roster spots. Bowman shared his enthusiasm for these players during his Overdrive interview, saying, ""I am pretty excited to see how a lot of these new players come in and give our team a little bit of a different look. ""As the Oilers gear up for training camp in September 2025, they're seen as strong contenders. According to NHL.com’s fantasy rankings from August 10, 2025, McDavid, Draisaitl, Evan Bouchard, and Zach Hyman are all listed as top fantasy picks.Also Read: Carter Hart’s NHL comeback feels dead in the water after bottom-tier save numbers and a lost season The Hockey Writers' forward point projections from September 10, 2025, predict McDavid will score over 140 points, while also highlighting the importance of contributions from prospects like Savoie and Howard.","The Edmonton Oilers had ended the offseason with an excruciating loss in the 2024-25 Stanley Cup Final and were defeated by Florida Panthers in Game 7. In 2025, aiming at preventing another disaster, Oilers GM, Stan Bowman was a guest on Overdrive on the radio of the sound OFF TSN 1050 in Toronto. Bowman expressed how people should do this building internally just like Connor McDavid had earlier said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123842528,imgsize-74186,width-400,resizemode-4/connor-mcdavid.jpg"

How Josh Jacobs could impact Thursday Night Football in Week 2

Josh Jacobs remains one of the biggest offensive weapons for the Green Bay Packers, and fans are eager to know if he will suit up for the primetime showdown against the Washington Commanders. With Green Bay looking to build early momentum in the 2025 NFL season, Jacobs’ availability is crucial to their offensive rhythm and overall game plan at Lambeau Field tonight. The clash comes under the bright lights of Thursday Night Football in NFL Week 2, adding even more spotlight to this matchup.Yes, Josh Jacobs is expected to play against the Washington Commanders. He has not been listed with any injury designation, and his Week 1 performance showed he is in good shape to lead the Packers’ rushing attack. Fantasy projections give him a near-certain chance of being active, meaning fans can count on seeing him on the field.Jacobs got off to a solid start in Week 1, but he could be in line for a much bigger performance in Week 2. Even though Thursday games often bring concern because of the short turnaround, Jacobs reportedly embraces the challenge. According to ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler, Jacobs could be “primed for a big role” on Thursday night, and he is pushing for a “rather large volume of touches.”Thursday, September 11, 20258:15 p.m. ETLambeau Field, Green Bay, WisconsinAmazon Prime VideoIn Week 2 of Thursday Night Football, the Green Bay Packers will take on the Washington Commanders at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The game kicks off at 8:15 p.m. ET, setting up an exciting primetime NFC matchup.Josh Jacobs has a quality that bettors love to see in running backs: he is Green Bay’s favorite goal-line option. In 2024, he scored 15 rushing touchdowns, many of which came in the red zone. While Jacobs isn’t known for breaking off long runs, he thrives in short-yardage situations, running with power and determination.Also Read: Miami Dolphins’ Week 1 struggles could turn real ugly with direct connection to Tyreek Hill trade talks and Mike McDaniel’s job uncertainty Washington, meanwhile, did an excellent job of stifling the New York Giants’ rushing attack in Week 1. However, the Giants’ offensive line has been a major weakness, particularly with Andrew Thomas sidelined. Green Bay, by contrast, boasts one of the strongest offensive lines in the league, giving Jacobs an advantage in the trenches. While he might not crack 100 yards on the ground this week, his chances of finding the end zone remain very high.","Green Bay Packers running back Josh Jacobs is expected to play against the Washington Commanders on Thursday Night Football.

Liberty Favored but Sun’s Grit Could Spark Surprises

Thehead into their September 11, 2025 matchup against thewith a clean injury report and renewed depth, offering a much-needed boost as they aim to reclaim their early-season form. After battling through mid-year absences and inconsistent performances, the team now looks poised to make a serious playoff push.• Breanna Stewart’s return is a game-changer for the Liberty. Cleared to play after recovering from a knee injury, Stewart’s presence both offensively and defensively in the paint will be key for the team’s strategy.• Sabrina Ionescu, who had missed several games earlier this month due to a toe issue, is also back in action. Her return brings stability to the Liberty’s playmaking and scoring options.• Aside from these previously injured players, the Liberty report no other players out or questionable, making them one of the healthiest teams heading into this critical matchup.Having started the season with a perfect record, the Liberty’s form dipped, going 17-17 in their last 34 games, but their restored depth gives them a fighting chance to mount a legitimate title defense.The Connecticut Sun face a stark contrast, dealing with multiple injuries that hinder their rotation and complicate their late-season surge. With veteran guards sidelined and role players pressed into larger roles, the Sun’s playoff aspirations hang by a thread.• Bria Hartley, a crucial backcourt presence, suffered a severe meniscus tear in late August and is out for the remainder of the season. Her absence leaves the Sun without one of their most dependable scorers and leaders.• Leila Lacan remains out with an undisclosed injury, further weakening the guard rotation and forcing younger players to step up.• Marina Mabrey continues her recovery from a late-season injury. Her absence affects perimeter shooting and fluid ball movement.• Aneesah Morrow, listed as day-to-day, faces ongoing concerns that limit bench depth and flexibility.Despite these setbacks, the Sun have leaned heavily on veteran Tina Charles and a strengthened frontcourt to keep hopes alive. Their three-game win streak heading into the game reflects resilience but also underscores the uphill battle they face.The injury situations dramatically impact how both teams will approach tonight’s game:• The Liberty’s full health means they can rely on Stewart’s two-way dominance and Ionescu’s aggressive playmaking to control the tempo and exploit mismatches.• The Sun’s depleted lineup forces them into unconventional rotations and relies on secondary players to step up, creating opportunities for breakout performances and strategic experimentation.This mismatch in health and depth adds a layer of unpredictability, with each team needing to adjust dynamically throughout the game.Fans should keep an eye on two major narratives that will define the contest:• Stewart’s comeback has been eagerly anticipated. Her ability to anchor both ends of the court could reignite the Liberty’s offense and defensive structure, potentially turning them back into championship contenders.• The Sun’s adversity-driven approach makes for compelling viewing. Without key guards, the team must innovate, lean on veteran leadership, and hope for standout performances from lesser-known contributors. Expect fast-paced play and surprising fourth-quarter swings.The Liberty’s restored health puts them in a strong position to regain their early-season dominance, offering fans and bettors alike confidence in their chances. At the same time, the Connecticut Sun’s resilience and inventive lineups make for an exciting and unpredictable matchup, with the potential for unexpected heroes to emerge under pressure.Also read: New York Liberty vs Connecticut Sun Prediction, Odds, Spread, Best WNBA Prop Bets, Moneyline, and More (September 11, 2025) Tonight’s game promises high stakes, dramatic shifts in strategy, and plenty of intrigue as the Liberty aim to capitalize on their depth, while the Sun fight to stay alive in the playoff hunt.","The Liberty report no other players out or questionable, making them one of the healthiest teams heading into this critical matchup.

How Savion Williams’ Guardian Cap makes his helmet stand out on field

Concussion experience shaped Williams’ early helmet choice

NFL slowly expands use of safety innovations

Williams’ helmet sends subtle message about safety

Guardian Cap reflects modern players’ focus on longevity

Green Bay Packers rookie wide receiver Savion Williams has drawn attention this season, but not just for his catches. His helmet looks unusually large compared to his teammates, prompting questions from fans. The difference is simple yet meaningful: Williams is wearing a Guardian Cap, a padded cover designed to reduce the risk of head injuries, showing his commitment to safety as he begins his NFL career.The Guardian Cap fits over a standard football helmet, adding soft padding to absorb collisions. First introduced on NFL practice fields in 2020, the league permitted their optional use in regular-season games starting in 2024. While it doesn’t eliminate the risk of head injuries, the cap helps reduce the force of hits, giving players additional protection in the physically demanding NFL environment.Williams missed part of training camp after suffering a concussion. Once he cleared concussion protocol, he returned to practice equipped with the Guardian Cap. The injury highlights the realities of professional football, where every hit carries risk, and his choice reflects a careful, forward-thinking approach even as a rookie just starting out.The league gradually incorporated Guardian Caps into its culture, first mandating them for certain positions in practice, then allowing optional use during regular-season games. These measures reflect a broader NFL trend: prioritizing player safety while maintaining the speed and skill of the sport.Although the helmet may look unusual to fans, it hasn’t slowed Williams on the field. Instead, it sends a quiet but important signal: protecting one’s health is a mark of intelligence and courage in a game often defined by toughness. As the season progresses, Williams’ decision may inspire others to adopt similar safety measures.In a league where every snap carries potential danger, Williams’ Guardian Cap is more than gear — it’s a statement. It blends prudence with performance, experience with ambition, and caution with confidence, showing that prioritizing safety can coexist with competitiveness.Also read: Chiefs Style Lounge 2025 brings high-fashion runway glam to Arrowhead Stadium for fans","Green Bay Packers rookie wide receiver Savion Williams has drawn attention this season, but not just for his catches.

The Indian women's hockey team suffered their first defeat in the Asia Cup, losing 1-4 to hosts China in a Super 4s match at Hangzhou on Thursday.

FIFA ruling resolves Al Nassr transfer complications



Aymeric Laporte rejoins Bilbao after Saudi Pro League spell



Athletic Bilbao have confirmed the return of Spanish defender Aymeric Laporte after FIFA authorized his move from Al Nassr in the Saudi Pro League. The switch had stalled on deadline day due to administrative delays, but the world football governing body has now allowed the registration to be completed.Athletic Bilbao released an official statement confirming FIFA had granted Spain’s football federation (RFEF) the authority to secure the International Transfer Certificate from Saudi Arabia. This cleared the way for Laporte’s registration in La Liga.The transfer had initially collapsed on September 1, when Al Nassr reportedly failed to input key details into FIFA’s Transfer Matching System. That omission prevented the paperwork from being validated before the deadline. The RFEF appealed the decision, and FIFA has now ruled in favor of the Spanish side.Laporte expressed his excitement in a short club video, saying he was happy to be back; and eager to contribute to Athletic’s upcoming season.FIFA’s decision to overturn its earlier refusal has provided clarity for both Laporte and Bilbao. The club regains a player who made over 160 La Liga appearances in his first spell. While Laporte secures a return to the team where his professional career began.The incident also underlined the challenges of coordinating moves. That too between European clubs and the Saudi Pro League. Despite the league’s financial growth and international talent pool, the registration delays remain a recurring issue.During his two seasons with Al Nassr, Laporte played alongside global stars such as Cristiano Ronaldo , Sadio Mané, João Félix, and Marcelo Brozović. While he was a consistent presence in defense, changes in the squad meant his long-term future was uncertain.Now, the Euro 2024 winner has returned to Athletic Bilbao with a wealth of experience. His time at Manchester City saw him win 13 trophies. This includes five Premier League titles and the UEFA Champions League Supporters at San Mamés are preparing a warm welcome. And, hopeful that Laporte’s leadership and defensive skills can help push the club forward.Also Read: Why top European stars are choosing Saudi Arabia over Europe",Athletic Bilbao have confirmed the return of Aymeric Laporte from Al Nassr.

LONDON: A prestigious award for sparkling wine has gone to an English bubbly rather than a wine from the Champagne region in France for the first time ever.Nyetimber’s £130 (Rs 15,000) Blanc de Blancs 2016 Magnum on Tuesday became the first ever non-Champagne wine to win the Champion Sparkling Wine Trophy at the International Wine Challenge (ICW) in London in the competition’s history.It was described by judges as a “racy, pithy blanc de blanc.. a time capsule of a wine with mouth-watering acidity, citrus zest and camomile, with a chalky finish”. It achieved 97 points, beating four others in the shortlist including the €260 (Rs 27,000) champagne Le Clos Lanson Blanc de Blanc 2010.Nyetimber’s head winemaker, Cherie Spriggs, also won Sparkling Winemaker of the Year for the second time, having first been awarded the trophy in 2018. At that time, she was the first person outside of Champagne to win the award and the first woman.British wine has never had more sparkle. Nyetimber is now the favourite among discerning high classes in the UK and is served at top restaurants, hotels and bars such as Annabel’s, The Goring, The Savoy and The Ivy. Nyetimber is not yet on sale in India.Spriggs and husband Brad Greatrix, who have been making English sparkling wine at Nyetimber, an historic estate, which appears in the Domesday Book, now owned by Dutchman Eric Heerema, since 2007, put its success down to the greensand and chalk soils at their 11 vineyards in West Sussex, Hampshire, and Kent. The soil is similar to that of the Champagne region thanks to the same chalk seam which runs under the English Channel.With the weather in England getting warmer owing to global warming, the South Downs has become ideal for growing the classic champagne grapes: Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Meunier.","Nyetimber’s £130 (Rs 15,000) Blanc de Blancs 2016 Magnum on Tuesday became the first ever non-Champagne wine to win the Champion Sparkling Wine Trophy at the International Wine Challenge.

Elizabeth Tsurkov, a determined Israeli-Russian graduate student and human rights advocate, has finally been freed after enduring 903 days in the captivity of Hezbollah in Iraq. Her ordeal, which began in March 2023 while she was conducting field research for Princeton University, tested her resilience and courage in unimaginable ways. Tsurkov’s steadfast commitment to her work, even in the face of prolonged detention and harsh conditions, exemplifies remarkable bravery and perseverance. Her release is not only a triumph for her and her family but also a condemnation of the tyranny and violence wielded by militant groups who seek to silence voices dedicated to knowledge and human rights.Tsurkov entered Iraq using her Russian passport to carry out research for her doctoral dissertation. On March 21, 2023, she was abducted in Baghdad’s Karrada district by Kata’ib Hezbollah after attempting to meet members of the Alwani family, including a senior militia official. A video of Tsurkov was later broadcast on Iraqi television in November 2023, confirming she was alive. During her captivity, her life and safety were under constant threat, drawing attention from governments, human rights organizations, and academic institutions worldwide.Tsurkov’s release came after prolonged negotiations involving the US, Iraq, and advocacy groups. Her family, particularly her sister Emma Tsurkov, tirelessly campaigned for her freedom, engaging with global organizations and policymakers to ensure Elizabeth’s safety. US authorities, the Global Reach nonprofit, and officials at the US Embassy in Baghdad played pivotal roles in facilitating her return, demonstrating the power of international advocacy and diplomacy in confronting injustice.Elizabeth Tsurkov, 37, is a Princeton University doctoral student and a fellow at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy. Her research focuses on Iraq and the broader Middle East, highlighting human rights, governance, and social justice. During her time in Iraq, she was known for her commitment to academic integrity and raising awareness of vulnerable communities, reflecting her courage not only in the field but also in confronting the broader challenges posed by conflict and oppression. Her scholarship and advocacy have left a lasting impact on both the academic and human rights communities.Tsurkov’s release is a moment of celebration for her family, colleagues, and the academic community. It underscores the importance of defending scholars, journalists, and researchers working in dangerous environments.

Her return to safety marks both a personal victory and a moral repudiation of those who wield terror to silence truth.","Elizabeth Tsurkov, 37, is a Princeton University doctoral student and a fellow at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy.
