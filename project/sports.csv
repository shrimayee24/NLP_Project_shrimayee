NEW DELHI: Even before the Indian cricket team embarked on their 2003-04 tour to Australia, the mind games had begun and most of the banter, as usual, came from the Aussies.There were talks of 'chin-music' being dished out to the Indians, especially to the captain Sourav Ganguly , who had ruffled quite a few Aussie feathers in the 2001 series in India.The desperate Aussies were gunning for revenge and with the first Test at their most favoured venue - The Gabba, they were expected to have the upper hand when Ganguly walked out for the toss with Steve Waugh , who was playing his last series.Ganguly won the toss and asked Australia to bat first. Play on the first three days was hampered due to rain. Zaheer Khan took 5 wickets, but Justin Langer 's 121 took the hosts to 323 in their first innings.Aakash Chopra and Virender Sehwag put up a 61-run opening stand before the latter fell to Nathan Bracken. But when Jason Gillespie dismissed Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar (adjudged out wrongly by umpire Steve Bucknor) in one over, India were in a spot of bother at 62/3. And then Ganguly walked out to join Chopra at the crease.Ganguly drove through the covers, cut through point, pulled to mid-wicket, flicked through mid-on, all the shots that bore the elegance of a left-handed batsman. The Indian captain reached his fifty off 74 balls and a century off 135 deliveries.Ganguly's 146-run stand with VVS Laxman (75) for the 5th wicket was notched up in 206 balls and his 144-run knock was studded with 18 hits to the fence. Such was the class of Ganguly's knock that it drew applause even from some of the Aussie players.The Test ended in a draw, but that day at the Gabba, Ganguly truly led India from the front with the bat and sent out a strong message to the Aussies that India was not going to be pushovers in the series.This also set the tone for Steve Waugh's farewell. The former Australian captain had to bring in all of his experience, grit and determination to the fore to save the series for Australia in the last Test in Sydney.","Ganguly won the toss and asked Australia to bat first.

The Multan Mystery: When Rahul Dravid left Sachin Tendulkar stranded at 194*,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/the-multan-mystery-when-rahul-dravid-left-sachin-tendulkar-stranded-at-194/articleshow/113268226.cms,"The unfortunate incident in Multan in 2004, where Rahul Dravid , who was leading the Indian team in the absence of injured regular skipper Sourav Ganguly , declared the innings with Sachin Tendulkar stranded at 194 not out, is etched in the memories of cricket fans as a rare moment of tension between two legends of the game.During the first Test of India's historic series against Pakistan , Tendulkar was batting brilliantly and approaching his double century after Virender Sehwag bludgeoned 309 in the match to become India’s first Test triple-centurion.However, with India's score at 675/5, Dravid made the surprising decision to declare the innings, leaving Tendulkar just six runs short of a milestone.Dravid’s decision was based on strategic reasons. He felt that putting Pakistan in to bat at that moment would give India the best chance to capitalize on the deteriorating pitch and the tired opposition.However, the timing of the declaration shocked many, including Tendulkar, who appeared visibly disappointed as he walked off the field, just shy of what could have been his double century.The incident drew mixed reactions. While some criticised Dravid for denying Tendulkar the opportunity to reach a personal milestone, others supported the decision, emphasizing that it was made with the team's best interest in mind.Despite the controversy, India went on to win the match by an innings and 52 runs, marking their first-ever Test victory on Pakistani soil.Though the episode briefly created tension between Dravid and Tendulkar, both players moved on, with Tendulkar later acknowledging that while he was momentarily upset, he understood Dravid’s decision was aimed at securing a win for the team.","Rahul Dravid declared innings with Sachin Tendulkar stranded at 194 not out.

Why has Virat Kohli never been auctioned in Indian Premier League?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/why-has-virat-kohli-never-been-auctioned-in-indian-premier-league/articleshow/113197142.cms,"NEW DELHI: The IPL 2025 auction is fast approaching, and one of the most pressing questions on everyone's mind is which players will be retained by their current teams before the anticipated mega auction. Virat Kohli , the batting maestro, is often a topic of discussion when it comes to IPL auctions. However, an interesting fact emerges: despite his immense popularity and skill, Kohli has never been sold in an IPL auction throughout his career with the Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ).The reason behind this mystery is quite simple, yet it has managed to evade many fans and followers of the game.Kohli joined RCB in 2008, the inaugural season of the IPL, as a young emerging player. At that time, Kohli was a member of the Indian U-19 team that had recently won the Under-19 World Cup, and his potential was recognised by RCB, who signed him directly.In the inaugural IPL auction held in 2008, players from the U-19 category were not permitted to take part, as they were selected through a pre-season draft instead. RCB was captivated by Kohli's outstanding performance in the U-19 World Cup 2008 and decided to secure his services, especially after Delhi Capitals (DC) showed no inclination to acquire him.RCB's decision to retain Kohli over the years has kept him from entering the IPL auction. Kohli’s loyalty to the franchise and their trust in his abilities have fostered a strong relationship.The IPL allows teams to retain a certain number of players ahead of each auction, ensuring continuity and team stability. Kohli has been retained by RCB before every auction, highlighting his value to the team. His performances for the franchise have consistently been outstanding, and he quickly evolved into one of the best batsmen in the league.Furthermore, Kohli was appointed as the captain of RCB in 2013, further cementing his place in the franchise. As a captain, he became the face of the team and was central to its brand and identity.Throughout his tenure as captain, Kohli guided the team to four playoff appearances, but the coveted championship remained elusive. Following the conclusion of the 2021 season, Kohli made the decision to relinquish his leadership position.While the ultimate prize may have eluded him, Kohli's individual accomplishments in the IPL are nothing short of remarkable. With an impressive tally of 8004 runs across 252 matches, he stands as the tournament's all-time leading run-scorer, boasting an average of 38.67.Kohli's 2016 campaign was particularly noteworthy, as he amassed an astonishing 973 runs, setting the record for the most runs scored in a single IPL season.His exceptional batting prowess is further highlighted by his unparalleled feat of scoring 8 centuries in the tournament, more than any other player. Additionally, Kohli has contributed 55 half-centuries to his IPL resume thus far.The combination of his consistent performances, leadership role, and marketability made Kohli indispensable for RCB. The franchise has always prioritised his retention, preventing him from entering the IPL auction.Kohli's dedication to RCB and his deep connection with the fans have ensured that he remains one of the few players in IPL history never to have been auctioned, making his journey unique and significant in the league's history.","Virat Kohli has never been sold in an IPL auction throughout his career with the Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ).

But what unfolded in the next few minutes stunned the entire cricketing world.The fourth ball of Pathan's over was a full-length delivery that swung in sharply. Salman Butt, deceived by the movement, got an inside edge, and the ball flew straight into the safe hands of Rahul Dravid at first slip.Buoyed by the early success, Pathan ran in with even more energy for the very next ball.

""I got into what we athletes call ‘the zone’ where you don’t really remember what happened for that 45-minute period.""But before his third-place playoff match, Paes, who was ranked 126 before entering the Olympics draw, had an injury concern and his wrist was placed in a hard cast for the ruptured tendons to heal in time for one of the most important matches of his career.However, Paes's resolve and grit ended up being bigger than the injury.""I don’t even remember the points because I was in such a trance. That's why I talk about a mystical and magical experience,” said Paes about his match at the Stone Mountain Tennis Center.The medal was an addition to the family's illustrious showcase, as Leander's bronze gave company to his dad Vece Paes's bronze, which he won as part of India's 1972 Olympics hockey team.",Tennis legend Leander Paes won a bronze medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.

Taylor Fritz

to become 1st Italian man to win US Open

He's 6 ft 3' with a scraggy crown, a face that doesn't say much and legs that are defined to cover great ground, run miles and miles at the speed of lightning. Then there is the intangible. An alloy of the unbendable ilk that runs through Jannik Sinner .The scrutiny the top-seed faced coming into the US Open is hard to imagine. He was fighting questions on his integrity - including some damning ones raised by fellow pros - following two positive tests in March for the banned steroid Clostebol.The 23-year-old was cleared of fault or negligence by an independent tribunal in the week before the season's final Grand Slam, but the court of public opinion, revved up by the engines of social discourse, had turned the glare on him. Players and the public alleged that tennis' anti-doping authorities had treated the world No. 1 differently from other players. At best it was a divided locker room.So, when Sinner threw up his arms up at the end of a power-packed slugfest with American Taylor Fritz, where he had rallied from 3-5 in the third set, reeling off four straight games to seal a dominant win, he stood tall in the winner's circle that isn't for the weak hearted. The world No. 1 took down Fritz, the top-ranked American, 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 to claim his second Grand Slam title of the year, making him the first Italian man to win in New York and also the first man in 47 years to claim his first two Grand Slam titles in the same season.""The pre-tournament circumstances wasn't easy,"" said Sinner, who teared up as he held the Tiffany-designed winner's trophy. ""I felt like I had grown, match by match and that my confidence level went higher and higher (with each match). I'm happy how I handled this one.""Sinner, who surrounded himself with a slim-look team in New York, after dropping physio and fitness coach Giacomo Naldi and Umberto Ferrara from his close circle, had his two coaches - Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi - and girlfriend Anna Kalinskaya , ranked 14 on the WTA Tour, to fall back on.""The people who are close to me daily, people who know me already from when I was very young, my family, my team and everyone who supports me,"" Sinner said of the people who stood by him in the hardest times of his young career. ""I always try to stick with them, especially when the moments are getting difficult and tough, because I know that they can help me in these moments.""Sinner, whose title run in New York has taken his record for the year to 55-5, and extended his winning streak to 11 matches, said he's still sometimes weighed down by the incidents of the last five months.""It was and it's still a little bit in my mind,"" he said. ""My team and people who are close to me, they know what I've been through in the last months. It was not only one week before the tournament. It was months. When I'm on court, I try to focus on the game, I've done a great job mentally staying there, every point I play.""Sinner has now won a Tour-leading six titles in a sparkling 2024 season and has moved him 4,105 points clear of his nearest challenger, German Alexander Zverev .Not since 2002 has a season gone by without tennis' trifecta - Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal - winning a major, which is reason for public debate by itself, but when a pair of pros aged 23 and under in - Carlos Alcaraz , 21, and Sinner - sweep up the Grand Slam calendar, splitting the 2024 haul between them, it's called a new dawn.""It's something new, but it's also nice to see. Nice to see new champions, new rivalries,"" Sinner said. ""I will always have players who are going to make me a better player, because there are going to be times where they beat me. Then you have to try to find a way to win against certain players... it's good for the sport to have some new champions.""Sinner had all the answers in New York City, even when he was pulled wide and away.

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner ’s 2024 US Open triumph on Sunday marked a major milestone in his tennis career, as he claimed his second Grand Slam title of the year.The 22-year-old Italian defeated Taylor Fritz in a straight-set victory, 6-3, 6-4, 7-5, ending a 21-year wait for an American male champion at the majors.Sinner’s historic win also made him the first Italian man to conquer the US Open, following his Australian Open success earlier in the year.Sinner’s rise in tennis is as unique as it is inspiring. However, before he was known for his powerful forehands and quick reflexes on the court, he was flying down the slopes of the Italian Alps .Growing up in the mountainous South Tyrol region, Sinner was a highly skilled skier, excelling in both slalom and giant slalom.His early years were spent mastering the art of skiing, competing in national junior events, and often securing first place in numerous competitions within his age category, where his balance and precision were key to his success.Skiing also instilled in him a strong mental focus, something that would later become an asset in his tennis career.At the age of 13, Sinner made a pivotal decision—choosing tennis over skiing. He relocated across Italy to train under the guidance of renowned coach Riccardo Piatti , in what proved to be a game-changing move.Piatti quickly recognized Sinner’s proactive, aggressive style, which stood out for someone so young. ""He hit the ball fast, always aiming to win the points,"" Piatti once remarked, noting that Sinner’s fearless mindset was a trait not commonly seen in junior players.Sinner himself credits his skiing background for shaping his mental approach to tennis. Just as in skiing, where each race lasts mere seconds and requires total focus, tennis demanded the same kind of short bursts of concentration.""In both skiing and tennis, he knows when to focus and when to relax,"" Piatti explained, drawing parallels between the two sports that have shaped Sinner’s rise.From being ranked 870th just two years ago to reaching the world number one spot in 2024, Sinner’s ascent has been meteoric. His calm under pressure and relentless drive to improve have made him a formidable force on the court.","Jannik Sinner is the first Italian man to win the US Open.

When Roger Federer corrected the chair umpire on a double bounce without using a video review,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/when-roger-federer-corrected-the-chair-umpire-on-a-double-bounce-without-using-a-video-review/articleshow/113182267.cms,"Roger Federer Explains Why This Ball Bounced Twice 👀

Roger Federer's achievements:

NEW DELHI: Roger Federer , the legendary tennis player with 20 Grand Slam titles , was warmly greeted by the audience at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Tuesday evening during the US Open quarterfinal match between Aryna Sabalenka and Zheng Qinwen .The Swiss icon, who retired in 2022 and played his final official match at Wimbledon the year before, acknowledged the crowd with a smile and a wave when he appeared on the stadium's videoboards.This marked Federer's first appearance at the US Open venue since his retirement. He holds the record for the most consecutive US Open championships, having secured five straight titles from 2004 to 2008.Additionally, he holds the record for the most consecutive weeks at No. 1 (237) in PIF ATP Rankings history (since 1973).During the ATP Masters 1000 Madrid final against Tomas Berdych , Federer demonstrated his keen observation skills and understanding of physics. In one rally, Federer noticed that the ball had bounced twice before Berdych made contact, a detail the chair umpire missed. Federer approached the umpire to discuss the incident.Roger Federer asked the chair umpire, ""Did you see the ball bounce towards me?""The umpire replied, ""Yeah, but to me, it looked like he came under with the racket.""Roger acknowledged what the umpire had to say and responded, ""Yeah, I know, but the ball came bouncing at me with topspin. The only way that happens is if he pushed it down into the court first.""The chair umpire clarified again, ""It looked like he just came under it. I probably missed it, but that’s how it appeared to me, Roger.""Roger replied, ""I agree it was close, but the result was obvious—he didn’t hit it the right way. Otherwise, the ball would’ve gone up in the air.""Despite Berdych's strong start, winning the first set with an impressive 14 winners and only two unforced errors, Federer managed to turn the match around in the second set. The Swiss maestro broke Berdych’s serve twice and capitalized on a double fault from the Czech player to secure the set.Berdych’s struggles continued in the third set, as he committed two more double faults, seemingly handing Federer a decisive lead at 5-3.However, Federer encountered a hiccup while serving for the match, allowing Berdych a brief reprieve. Nonetheless, Berdych found himself in trouble again in the 12th game, facing three championship points at 0-40.Although he managed to save all three, he ultimately succumbed to Federer’s pressure, hitting a forehand into the net to concede the match and the title to the Swiss champion.With 103 titles and 1,251 wins, Federer is second only to Connors' 109 titles and 1,274 wins in the Open Era.Remarkably, he never retired in 1,526 singles and 224 doubles matches throughout his career. Twenty-time Grand Slam champion owns all-time Grand Slam record with 369 wins and 58 QFs, as well as 10 finals, 23 SFs and 36 QFs in a row.Federer holds tournament records for the most titles at Basel (10), Halle (10), Wimbledon (8), and ATP Masters 1000 Cincinnati (7).His impressive achievements include a 41-match winning streak (2006-07), reaching 17 consecutive finals (2005-06), a 24-final winning streak (2003-05), 24 straight victories against Top 10 players (2003-05), and 65 consecutive wins on grass (2003-08).","Roger Federer was warmly greeted by the audience at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Tuesday evening during the US Open quarterfinal match between Aryna Sabalenka and Zheng Qinwen.

to Slam collection with victory over home hope

FUN FACT!

A flood of emotion hit Aryna Sabalenka as she fell on her back on the Arthur Ashe stadium . Her palms covered her face. The lines between reality and realization were happily smudged.In previous years, the powerful 26-year-old had come close at the US Open, on Saturday she wasn't thinking touching distance.A millimetre. A nanosecond. The Belarusian then held herself together - thunderbolt play and reined in emotions - against New Yorker Jessica Pegula . Sabalenka took leads and squandered advantages as the battling 30-year-old clawed back. In the second set, the world No.6 went from skidding to kicking 0-3 to 5-3 before Sabalenka, the WTA's hardcourt queen, powered to a 7-5, 7-5 win.The statuesque world No.2, on a 12-match winning streak, wrapped up a near perfect 27-1 run in the last four Slams on hardcourts, having also won the Australian Open last year and this year. ""So many things were going through my mind,"" Sabalenka said of the moment when she watched Pegula's forehand sail long on match point. ""All those tough losses in the past… I was so proud of myself and proud of my team that we were able to come back stronger and come back with better tennis.""""And now finally we are having this beautiful trophy. I don't know how to describe that feeling. You're crying, you're laughing, you feel all these emotions at the same time. That's the best feeling. I really wish everyone could experience that,"" she said.There were no flashbacks from last year for Sabalenka during the near two-hour final, save for when it was all done. ""I kept reminding myself that this is the final of the US Open, of course she's going to fight really hard for it and it's not going to be easy, and I have to work really hard to get it,"" the second seed said. ""In those tough moments, I was trying to stay strong, reminding myself that I have been through a lot and I'm strong enough to hold under this pressure.""If she gained cognizance of her victory when lying on her back on the Arthur Ashe stadium, the Belarusian, who had a complete makeover later in the evening for the champion's photo shoot, owned the silverware as she posed for photographs on the grounds. Sabalenka wore a high-slit sleeveless red dress that was accessorized by her beaming smile as she held the trophy close.The sky was dark and the lights burned bright. The only comparison on Saturday to Sabalenka's laugh, a clear, ringing sound, was her forehand, which according to Eurosport was struck at an average speed of 129 kmph, the fastest on both sides of the draw at the US Open. Sabalenka's shot is flatter, which accelerates the strike, taking her past Carlos Alcaraz' average of 127 kmph and Jannik Sinner's 126 kmph.The second seed - who has had to deal with some tragic reverses in the last few years, including losing her father Sergey to meningitis five years ago at the age of 43, and then her former boyfriend Konstantin Koltov, an ice hockey player, dying by suicide almost six months ago in March at the age of 42 - has waged a sturdy battle on and off the court.Tennis was Sabalenka's anchor during her tough days. ""After I lost my father, it's been my goal to put our family name in the history of tennis,"" she said. ""Every time I see my name on that trophy, I'm so proud of myself, I'm proud of my family that they never gave up on my dream and that they were doing everything they could to keep me going.""After her loss to American Coco Gauff last year she picked apart her predicament. ""The good news is that it's me against me,"" she had said. This time it was Aryna Sabalenka versus Jessica Pegula. There was a noisy full house under the roof, but the Belarusian was up and away. The gates in her head were locked.""I faced a lot of challenges on and off the court. Like being injured and not able to play Wimbledon . It was a new experience for me,"" she said. ""That's why it's very special, because no matter what I came back stronger. I never gave up on this dream.""Tennis fans in the city were introduced to Aryna Sabalenka's power packed game in Nov 2017 when, just 19, the Belarusian competed in and won the Mumbai Open, a WTA 125k event. It was the biggest title of her career at that point.",Aryna Sabalenka beats Jessica Pegula in US Open final. Belarusian has won last four Slams on hardcourts.

En route to the final, Fritz showcased his skills by overcoming higher-ranked opponents, including former runners-up Casper Ruud and Alexander Zverev.The two finalists, currently ranked 12th in the world, had previously faced each other on two occasions. Fritz emerged victorious in their initial encounter at Indian Wells in 2021, but Sinner exacted revenge when they met again in the California desert two years later.""The serve and the movement, massive improvements,"" said Fritz when asked to pinpoint the changes in Sinner's game.""I felt in 2021 I could get myself in points off of his first serve every time. Then it was much easier to hurt him from the ground, as well.""So he's much faster, a lot better out of the corners. His serve is really good now.""","Taylor Fritz feels he ""let a lot of people down"" by losing to Jannik Sinner in the US Open final.
