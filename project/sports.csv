NFL fined Travis Kelce $14K for paying tribute to Tony Gonzalez with a TD celebration dunk

The NFL has imposed a $14,069 fine on Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce for unsportsmanlike conduct during his Christmas Day touchdown celebration . In the fourth quarter, Kelce dribbled the ball on the crossbar of the goalpost after receiving a 12-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes, paying tribute to Hall of Fame and former Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez.The Kansas City Chiefs end their regular season on Sunday but have playoff hopes that do not matter in significance. The No. 1 seed for the AFC has been guaranteed; their game with the Denver Broncos would actually secure the position in the final playoffs for the Chiefs, a win may still allow a pathway for either Miami Dolphins or Cincinnati Bengals.The Chiefs will be resting top starters, including Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, and Chris Jones, for two weeks to prepare for the postseason. The NFL has fined Kelce for a mistake in Week 17, causing a slight upset during Kelce's holidays and time off.On Christmas Day, Kelce caught a touchdown pass from Mahomes against the Pittsburgh Steelers, dunking the ball through the goal posts in celebration. The celebration was intended to pay homage to Tony Gonzalez, a legendary tight end and former Chief, but Kelce's attempt was deemed inappropriate and ultimately failed.However, the NFL banned a controversial celebration that led to a penalty flag and a $14,069 fine for Kelcel. Fans were shocked by this decision, but the NFL is known for its strict stance on bizarre events. Kelce acknowledged the Steelers' win as a commendable offense, despite its perceived snobbery to casual No Fun League viewers.""You know I had to show love to the greatest of all time!! you did mention you’d help me with the fine tho,"" Kelce stated, meaning that Gonzalez will be pitching in some dough.Kelce has been penalized before for a questionable action in a 2020 game against the New York Jets. With the record, he probably won't do it again. But Kelce's exuberant personality might make for some thrilling celebrations in the postseason as the Chiefs pursue the first Super Bowl three-peat in NFL history.Also Read: The Chiefs' flight finally departed after being delayed for four hours in Kansas City due to an ice storm that disrupted operations The NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement mandates that 50% of fine money collected from players should go to the Players Assistance Trust, run by the NFLPA, for the care of retired players, and the remaining half goes to charitable organizations jointly determined by the NFL and the NFLPA.","NFL fined Travis Kelce $14K for paying tribute to Tony Gonzalez with a TD celebration dunk.

Tua Tagovailoa on his injury

Tagovailoa and Armstead meet with the media l Miami Dolphins

The Miami Dolphins will close the season in Week 18, but the status of the starting quarterback is still undetermined. Tua Tagovailoa, the team's highest-paid player, was downgraded to doubtful for his game against the New York Jets, and the medical staff may not allow him to play. All signs indicate that Tua will sit in Week 18. The Dolphins will probably confirm this later in the day. Miami's hopes of a playoff seed will rest on Tyler Huntley. So, the question remains whether or not Tua Tagovailoa is playing the game tonight?No, Tua Tagovailoa will not be playing against the New York Jets tonight. The Miami Dolphins secured a much-needed win without their starting quarterback, Tua Tagovailoa, to keep them in the running for an AFC playoff spot. Tyler Huntley played well in Tua's absence and led the Dolphins to an 8-8 record and into the NFL playoff bracket. The team has been practicing all week, with Huntley expected to start in Week 18 as Tagovailoa recovers from a hip injury.Listed as doubtful for today's game, Tua tagged the same status as last week. Coach Mike McDaniel confirmed that the quarterback is dealing with a ""unique muscle injury,"" and the bone is fine. He has promised to be available if the Dolphins make the playoffs. The Dolphins struggled in a loss to the Houston Texans on December 15. Tua suffered a hip injury that caused three interceptions.He played in a win over the 49ers but aggravated the injury. He was downgraded to doubtful and ruled out before the game. McDaniel confirmed that Tua is experiencing a unique muscle issue, and there was no damage to his hip bone. ""It's not a surgical solution. It is a 'stop aggravating it by pushing through'"" situation, McDaniel said.Tua Tagovailoa appeared forced to smile during a press conference, indicating a lack of clarity on the injury's cause and recovery timeline. “See, it just gets so hard because we’re just giving broad -- we’re giving you guys broad things about what the injury is,” Tagovailoa said.Miami has a chance to make the playoffs if the Dolphins defeat the Jets and the Denver Broncos lose to the Kansas City Chiefs on the final Sunday of the regular season. The games will be shown on FOX and CBS, with the Dolphins away and the Broncos at home. The timeline for Tagovailoa's return is still relevant.“It’s tough for any competitor to have to sit out when the season’s on the line and you know you can do more,” Tagovailoa said. “But that just tells you how much trust and respect we have for Snoop. The defense has been balling as well, so looking forward to what our guys can do this Sunday, and we’ll see how the cards fall and how they play out.…”“If the cards play out the way they should, and the way we know and think they can, I’m going to be available next week. There’s no ifs, ands or buts. I’ll be playing, that’s for sure,” he added.Also Read: Will Davante Adams play against the Miami Dolphins tonight?

Will Davante Adams play against the Miami Dolphins tonight?

Davante Adams’ future with the Jets

Davante Adams, a wide receiver for the New York Jets , struggled in a Week 17 loss against the Buffalo Bills, catching only five passes for 47 yards. He needs 25 receiving yards for his fifth consecutive 1,000-yard season, but the Miami Dolphins defense is allowing the fewest fantasy points per game to wide receivers this season. So, the question remains whether or not Davante Adams is playing the game tonight against the Dolphins?Yes, Davante Adams is playing against the Miami Dolphins tonight. Adams is not listed on the injury report this week, so barring any setbacks, he is on track to play tonight. He's going up against the Miami Dolphins, who allow 207.8 passing yards per game. Not to mention, Adams has a 975-yard year with seven touchdowns and 79 passes on 129 targets despite the Dolphins' ninth-best passing rate.Adams' 2.1-yard average depth of target in Buffalo's loss could be similar this week due to the Dolphins' defense prioritizing big play. Although this might limit Adams' raw upside, he's averaging a career-high 5.6 yards per catch after reception this season, indicating a promising future.New York Jets owner Woody Johnson revealed in November that the team would be releasing veteran players such as Aaron Rodgers and Davante Adams during the offseason as part of a franchise reset. There's now more detail on why at least Rodgers and Adams could have a new NFL home later this year.""Barring an unforeseen change, the Jets are expected to move on from QB Aaron Rodgers and WR Davante Adams this offseason,"" uStadium reported on Tuesday. ""Source tells us the relationship between owner Woody Johnson and Rodgers is 'irreparable.'”Adams could become a salary-cap casualty and wouldn't have much reason to want to stay with a rebuilding Jets side if the club shows Rodgers, the 32-year-old's close friend, the door. On October 15, 2024, the Raiders traded Adams to the New York Jets in exchange for a 2025 conditional draft selection that if Adams is a first or second-team All-Pro in 2024, or active for the AFC Championship Game or Super Bowl LIX, will be a second-round selection, but if none of the aforementioned conditions are met, it will be a third.But the other scenario is now out of the question with the Jets having been mathematically eliminated from playoff contention after an overtime loss to the Miami Dolphins on Saturday. The trade reunites Adams with Aaron Rodgers, whom he played with from 2014 to 2021 with the Green Bay Packers. Adams made his Jet debut on October 20 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, catching three passes for 30 yards in the first half.Also Read: Will Bo Nix play against the Kansas City Chiefs tonight? Latest injury update on the Denver Broncos star player However the Jets lost 37-15. In Week 9, Adams briefly left for head injury evaluation but returned in the fourth quarter, catching a 37-yard touchdown pass to seal a 21-13 victory. In Week 15, Adams had a breakout game of 198 yards and two touchdowns on nine receptions, including a career-long 71-yard score, as the Jets won 32-25, snapping a four-game losing streak. The receiver also became the 12th receiver in NFL history to reach 100 career receiving touchdowns.","New York Jets wide receiver Davante Adams is expected to play against the Miami Dolphins tonight.

Travis Kelce finished 1st in Pro Bowl Games fan voting

Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs will close out the regular season in a matchup with the Denver Broncos tonight. Since the Chiefs already locked up the AFC's No. 1 seed and get a bye in the NFL playoffs, quarterback Patrick Mahomes and the rest of the team's stars won't play. Kelce broke Tony Gonzelez's record for most touchdown receptions in franchise history last week. So, the question remains whether or not Travis Kelce is playing the game tonight?No, Travis Kelce won't be playing against the Denver Broncos tonight. The Chiefs have provided a crucial update on the status of some key starters ahead of Week 18, including tight end Travis Kelce. The Kansas City Chiefs closed out their final regular season game against the Denver Broncos, but they earned the No. 1 seed and a first-round playoff bye by beating the Pittsburgh Steelers on Christmas Day. Chiefs head coach Andy Reid is expected to rest most starters, with backup Carson Wentz as the starter, excluding quarterback Patrick Mahomes.The Chiefs have marked their starting quarterback, Kelce, as doubtful for the weekend's game versus the Broncos while also listing his fellow teammate and the starting point guard, Mahomes, with a doubtful marking. This denotes that Kelce will miss Week 18, a fact shared along with Chris Jones, Trent McDuffie, Nick Bolton, Kareem Hunt, George Karlaftis, Justin Reid, Drue Tranquill, Isiah Pacheco, Jawaan Taylor, Mecole Hardman, and Jaylen Watson.Kelce, a 10-time Pro Bowler, was also rested last year despite being 16 yards shy of his eighth consecutive 1,000-yard season. Fans were sad to see the end of his streak, but the extra week of rest paid off. During the Chiefs' journey to becoming back-to-back Super Bowl champions in last year's playoffs, Kelce registered 32 receptions for 355 yards and three touchdowns.Kansas City Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce earned 252,200 votes in fan balloting for the 2025 Pro Bowl Games thanks to his relationship with Taylor Swift.

Bo Nix is hyper-fosued on getting to 10 tonight

An AFC West showdown between the Kansas City Chiefs and Denver Broncos takes center stage, as the Chiefs have already locked up a first-round bye and a 14-1 record. The Broncos are still playing to win out at 9-7 in the same division. The Chiefs have rested key starters- including quarterback Patrick Mahomes-for this matchup, while the Broncos are 83% to make the playoffs but will draw the Miami Dolphins and Cincinnati Bengals. So, the question remains whether or not Broncos star player Bo Nix is playing the game tonight?Yes, Bo Nix will be playing against the Kansas City Chiefs tonight. Assuming that he doesn't have any setbacks, Nix is expected to play tonight, as he didn't appear on the injury report this week. In Week 9 against the Baltimore Ravens, Nix hauled in his first career receiving touchdown on a trick play from receiver Courtland Sutton.In week 10, Nix threw for 215 yards, two touchdowns, and led a drive late in the game that finished with a field goal attempt at the end. This was when it was possible to win with the Kansas City Chiefs. Then against the Atlanta Falcons the next week, he completed 28-of-33 for a personal best of 307 yards with four touchdowns to help the Broncos defeat the Atlanta Falcons 38–6.He is the first in NFL history from a rookie quarterback to complete passes over 80% while making at least four touchdowns and over 300 yards passing. After this game, he was named as AFC Offensive Player of the Week and Rookie of the WeekBo Nix will be heard again by fans before the season ends, regardless of the outcome of tonight's game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Nix has a post-game date, but whether he wins is uncertain. The Broncos have been fighting for their 10th win, with Justin Herbert and Joe Burrow causing problems, despite Nix's performance in both losses. Nix is very focused on getting a 10 on Sunday's lose-or-go-home proposition.“Our goal the past couple of weeks is get to 10 [wins],"" Nix said on Wednesday. ""We have another opportunity to do that.” Under pressure, Nix has shown comfort in his recent performances, particularly in Cincinnati.

The Kansas City Chiefs have secured the No. 1 seed in the AFC, preventing them from participating in the Wild Card round.Andy Reid confirmed that Carson Wentz will replace Mahomes for Kansas City's final regular season match-up. Wentz has only appeared twice this season, with only 20 passing yards, and has seen minimal action behind Mahomes.Mahomes and his Chiefs may have as many as 25 days between their final regular-season game with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Kansas City's eventual Divisional Round appearance in the postseason, where they are heavy Super Bowl favorites, a feat that no team has ever accomplished for three years straight in the history of the National Football League. The Chiefs have planned to take their starters into Week 18 before giving them an extended week off until the Divisional Round. Mahomes is not projected to be held out past Week 18.Patrick Mahomes told reporters that he had a minor ankle injury, not as severe as a high-ankle sprain he suffered in the 2023 playoffs, and that his ankle has responded well to treatment. ""Obviously it's a short amount of time but I thought we had a good day yesterday and good work after the game as well,"" Mahomes said. ""That's the reason you play this game,"" Mahomes said. ""I'll get the work at practice and try to push it to see where I can get to.”“At the end of the day, I'm not going to put our team in a bad position,"" Mahomes said. ""Carson will be ready to go as well,"" Mahomes said. ""He prepares as good as anyone I've ever been around.”Also Read: Travis Kelce broke out his amazing Patrick Mahomes voice in an episode of New Heights podcast as Caitlin Clark revealed her favorite Chiefs players Andy Reid will keep a few more players on the bench for tonight's game against the Denver Broncos.

Matt Nagy spoke on Travis Kelce's place in the playoff preparation for his team

Kansas City Chiefs Offensive Coordinator Matt Nagy spoke on Travis Kelce 's place in the playoff preparation for his team at the Chiefs' training complex Thursday, Jan. 2, 2025, in Kansas City. Kelce, despite numerous accolades and accomplishments, offensive coordinator for the Chiefs Matt Nagy says Kelce's wanting to win by more than over numbers and statistics makes him a special player.Kansas City Chiefs 35-year-old tight end Travis Kelce has been selected for his 10th consecutive Pro Bowl. He still leads the Chiefs in receiving yards and is a Pro Bowler despite a sluggish start to 2024. He set the Chiefs' franchise record for touchdown catches and continues to cement his Hall of Fame-worthy resumé, despite not scoring his first touchdown until October 27. Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy believes Kelce's focus on winning over accumulating statistics sets him apart from other players.“The beautiful part about Trav is he does not care about it,"" Nagy told the media on Thursday. ""He wants to continue to just keep winning. He cares about these trophies, he cares about winning, extremely unselfish, how he takes care of his body in practice throughout the week. It’s special. You’re not going to see many tight ends like him. What he does is rare. I'd say he's having a hell of a season right now.”Kelce, drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the 2013 NFL draft, has been a major player in the team's success. The Chiefs have made the playoffs in all but one season, winning three Super Bowls and making the Super Bowl in four of the last five seasons.Kelce is not only a key player for the team. He is the all-time leader in postseason receptions, yards, and touchdowns, tied with Jerry Rice for the most postseason games with 100 receiving yards and at least one touchdown reception. With the Chiefs starting the season 15-1 and looking to pull off the first Super Bowl three-peat in NFL history, Kelce pursuit of winning won't slow down anytime soon.Also Read: Travis Kelce is ready to retire and start a family with Taylor Swift wherever she wants after his current contract with the Chiefs expire in 2027 Nagy, a former college football quarterback who played at the University of Delaware from 1997 through 2000, failed his contract with the National Football League but went on to play for the Arena Football League and was assigned to multiple teams. In retirement, he worked as an assistant coach with the Philadelphia Eagles since 2009 for five years.In 2013, he was promoted to quarterbacks coach under head coach Andy Reid, and in 2016, he was promoted to offensive coordinator. Nagy was appointed as the Bears' head coach in 2018, and the team went on to win their first NFC North division title and playoff appearance since 2010.

GRIZZLIES at KINGS | FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS | January 3, 2025

When and where to watch the Golden State Warriors vs Sacramento Kings game tonight (January 5, 2025)?

Sacramento Kings star De’Aaron Fox is listed as “questionable” for his team’s upcoming game against the Golden State Warriors. Fox’s participation in the contest is currently in doubt as the 27-year-old is dealing with a right glute contusion. The injury occurred during Sacramento’s game against the Grizzlies this Friday. The Kings won the match 138-133 but lost their best player De’Aaron Fox in the process.It is worth noting that De’Aaron Fox stayed on the floor till the final minute of the Kings’ game against the Grizzlies. If his recent injury was serious he would’ve been rushed to the locker room instead. Fox’s injury comes at a difficult time for the Kings who are currently on a three-game winning streak. However, it also presents the team’s other players to show their mettle by getting a win against Stephen Curry and his Warriors.While fans are hopeful that Fox’s status gets upgraded ahead of the contest, it is a long shot at best. But, if the Kings can make it four in a row on Golden State’s home turf it’ll be a big confidence boost for the team. Fox has played 19 games against the Warriors in his career and averages 20.9 points, 6.6 assists, and 3.3 rebounds against them. Having him on the floor would’ve provided a big boon to the squad.However, with Fox’s participation in doubt, the team will be counting on players like Malik Monk, DeMar DeRozan, and Domantas Sabonis to fill in the void. DeMar DeRozan is one to look out for as he has always been good against the Dubs. Through 28 games against Golden State, DeRozan averages 21.8 points, 4.9 assists, and 3.8 rebounds. The 35-year-old is long overdue for a big game and tonight could finally be his time to shine.While the Kings deal with their injury issues, Golden State’s Stephen Curry is back in the lineup. Curry missed his team’s game against the Grizzlies but will be suiting up to take on the Kings tonight. Surely, a win tonight will do wonders for De’Aaron Fox and the Sacramento Kings. It’ll be interesting to see what Kings head coach, Mike Brown has in store for us tonight.ALSO READ: Golden State Warriors vs Sacramento Kings (01/05): Starting five, injury report, start time, game prediction, betting tips, how to watch, and more The Golden State Warriors will host the Sacramento Kings at 8:30 PM ET.

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

NEW DELHI: Former Indian batter Sanjay Manjrekar on Sunday made a massive statement, suggesting that India captain Rohit Sharma 's interview on Day 2 of the fifth Test against Australia in Sydney might have been prompted by head coach Gautam Gambhir receiving credit for his exclusion. Rohit opted out of the fifth and final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, with Jasprit Bumrah stepping in as captain in his absence. India suffered a six-wicket defeat in the SCG Test and lost the series 1-3.Amid various speculations about Rohit's decision to exclude himself from the playing eleven, he addressed the issue during the lunch session on Day 2 in an interview with Star Sports, clarifying the situation.However, Manjrekar believes Rohit sought to clarify his stance because Gambhir was being credited for the decision to leave him out of the lineup.""But there was also another reason why he was doing that interview. To clear the air. Somewhere I think Gambhir was getting all the credit for a brave call by leaving Rohit Sharma out. He wanted to set the record straight. Let's be honest. I loved that interview. That first bit where he said, I couldn't have another out-of-form batter in the XI, and that's why he opted out. But there were some other emotions, too,"" Manjrekar told Star Sports.""One thing that a lot of players say is that 'I will decide my future'. I have a problem with that. You can decide your future with regards to retirement, but somebody else has got the job to decide your future as a player and captain,"" he added.""That's the chairman of selectors. You have got to respect the hierarchy, however big you are. If the chairman of selectors is strong and he believes in the long-term health of Indian cricket, he has the power to decide whether your career should end now, or you get a few more matches, or one more series. Retirement is in your hands, but playing for India is not,"" Manjrekar explained.Rohit concluded the Border-Gavaskar Trophy on a disappointing note, scoring only 31 runs in five innings at an average of 6.20.",Sanjay Manjrekar believes Gautam Gambhir was getting all the credit for leaving Rohit Sharma out of the playing eleven.

Australia crush India inside three days to bag

Border-Gavaskar Trophy

Poll Does India Need to Rethink Its Leadership in Test Cricket? No, Current Leadership Is Fine Yes, New Leadership Needed

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

SYDNEY: Gone in three days. All the attendant hype, all their loyal legions of fans, all the batting superstars and all the swagger couldn't save India as Australia prised out the Border-Gavaskar Trophy from their fingers for the first time in a decade.Indian cricket simultaneously hit its lowest point in that 10-year period here on Sunday.The team's batting lineup resembled a motley crew of shrill wannabes eager to stake claim and obsolete stalwarts looking to buy time. The bowling reeked of anxious overdependence on Jasprit Bumrah , an all-time great whose body simply gave up at the end of his memorable Australian summer.Now, there are no second rung of pacers worth the newsprint, no spinners left standing who can claim an automatic berth. The team looks bereft of leadership after Rohit Sharma 's flipflops over his batting position, which eventually cost him his place in the side. To add to the woes, the playing XI picks often bordered on the bizarre.It's a wonder India came away with a 1-3 scoreline in some tough batting conditions against one of the strongest Australian pace attacks ever.They simply lacked the depth to challenge the hosts for sustained periods, a prerequisite to winning a Test match. In a portent of things to come, they came into this series already rattled by the 0-3 whitewash to New Zealand at home, and made things worse for themselves.On Day Three of the fifth Test, as Travis Head and Beau Webster galloped towards the 162-run target and Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj kept feeding them easy runs by straying down leg, India's inadequacies came into sharp focus. They had already over bowled Bumrah to the point of no return in the previous game at the MCG, but failed to pick an extra seamer to support him on the spiciest pitch of all.India chose an extra spinner instead in Washington Sundar and gave him one over across the two innings. If the idea was to cash in on Sundar's batting abilities, why not pick one of the specialists already in the squad? Nitish Kumar Reddy was another case in point, just an extra cushion for top-order failures rather than a serious medium-pace option.The approach across the two innings also raised questions. In the first, India knuckled down for a plod-a-thon, clearly not what this generation of batters is made for. In the second they went to the other extreme, batting as if they had given up all hope of scoring patient runs on this surface. Take out Rishabh Pant's stodgy 40 in the first innings and pulsating 61 in the second, and there's little else to speak of.Though the writing was on the wall, hope still flickered when Sundar and Jadeja resumed the innings on the third day. Instead, India lost four wickets for 16 runs in 7.5 overs as the canny, skillful Pat Cummins and the gloriously persistent Scott Boland - who bagged his first 10-wicket haul - ran through the tail.Australia's target still seemed substantial given the inconsistent bounce on the surface.If only Bumrah had been around. India's stand-in captain did come out to bat but was nowhere to be seen during the warm-ups. He had been taken for scans after experiencing back spasms on the second day, and given the history of back injuries, thought it best not to bowl. The man of the series finished with 32 wickets at 13.06 but wasn't available when needed most of all.When Australia batted, Prasidh and Siraj gave away 26 off the first two overs, 12 of them extras. The first three overs yielded 35 and allowed Usman Khawaja some breathing room. But when Prasidh got a fidgety Steve Smith with some steep bounce just one run shy of the 10,000-run mark, expectation again lingered.Siraj got rid of Khawaja after lunch but then India ran into old nemesis Travis Head, who held one end firm as Beau Webster shaved quick runs off the target to fashion Australia's six-wicket win.Pat Cummins' men now have another World Test Championship title within sight. While they too must address inevitable questions of transition sometime later this year, that inquisition must wait.India, on the other hand, will be weighed down by the magnitude of their failure in Australia. No amount of white-ball bashing in docile conditions can erase the consequences of this series defeat.",India's batting lineup resembled a motley crew of shrill wannabes eager to stake claim and obsolete stalwarts looking to buy time. The bowling reeked of anxious overdependence on Jasprit Bumrah.

NEW DELHI: Australia regained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the first time in 10 years by winning the fifth and final Test by six wickets against an Indian team deprived of their captain and star bowler Jasprit Bumrah at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Sunday.The hosts chased down the 162-run target just after lunch on the third day after earlier wrapping up India's second innings in quick time for 157.Australia won the series 3-1 after victories in Adelaide and Melbourne, to go with a nervy, yet successful, run-chase in the final innings in Sydney. India won the first Test at Perth and the third Test at Brisbane was a draw.Among the former cricketers who expressed their disappointment over the series defeat was Mohammad Kaif , who said India needs to build a Test team.Talking on his official X handle Kaif said, ""On 23rd February India will earn a lot of praise by beating Pakistan (in Champions Trophy) and everyone will say we are a champion team in white-ball cricket. But if India want to team the World Test Championship then we will have to make a Test match team, will have to learn to play on a turning track, in Australia we will have to learn to play on seaming tracks. The truth is that we are just white-ball bullies. We are lagging too far behind. If we have to win WTC, then players will have to play domestic cricket on turning tracks, will have to practice on seaming tracks, otherwise we will not be able to win.""The victory in Sydney also enabled Australia to book their spot in a second straight World Test Championship final where they will play the already-qualified South Africa at Lord's in June.Kaif continues, ""India lost 1-3, and I think this is a wake-up call, because now we have to pay our attention towards Test cricket . It's not just Gautam Gambhir who is at fault. All players get the chance to play Ranji Trophy , but it gets tiresome for the players and they prefer rest over playing Ranji Trophy. They don't play Ranji Trophy, they don't play practice matches then how will they become better players? It's tough to play on turning tracks in India and tougher to play on seaming tracks in Australia and South Africa. So if you don't practice well, WTC will keep eluding you. What has happened, it has happened for the good and now Team India needs to work hard in Test cricket.""After the defeat against Australia, India head coach Gautam Gambhir had urged all senior players to play domestic games and show their ""commitment"" towards red-ball cricket.""I would always like everyone to play domestic cricket. That is how much importance domestic cricket needs to be given. Not only one game, if they are available and they have the commitment to play red-ball cricket, everyone should play domestic cricket,"" Gambhir said.""As simple as it can get. If you don't give importance to domestic cricket, you will never get the desired players that you want in Test cricket,"" Gambhir added.","Australia won the series 3-1 after victories in Adelaide and Melbourne, to go with a nervy, yet successful, run-chase in the final innings in Sydney.

NEW DELHI: A heated exchange unfolded on day three of the second Test between South Africa and Pakistan at Newlands when Wiaan Mulder aggressively threw the ball at Babar Azam, hitting the Pakistani batter.The incident occurred in the 32nd over of Pakistan’s follow-on innings. Babar played a firm drive back to the bowler, who collected it in his follow-through before hurling it at the batter.The throw, far from accurate, struck Babar on his foot as he stood slightly outside his crease.Subsequently, words were exchanged, and the atmosphere grew tense as players from both sides intervened, with the umpires stepping in to diffuse the situation.Watch:Amid the drama, Babar remained composed, continuing his impressive knock alongside captain Shan Masood. The duo stitched together a remarkable 205-run opening stand, a record for Pakistan against South Africa in Tests.Masood’s unbeaten 102, complemented by Babar’s fluent 81, displayed resilience as Pakistan fought to recover from a 421-run first-innings deficit.Babar’s innings, however, ended 14 minutes before the close when he edged Marco Jansen to gully, once again missing out on a long-awaited century.Despite the disappointment, his efforts, coupled with Masood’s century, emphasised that the pitch held no hidden terrors.The second innings starkly contrasted Pakistan’s first, where Babar (58) and Mohammad Rizwan (46) offered brief resistance before a collapse.Debutant Kwena Maphaka and Wiaan Mulder dismantled Pakistan's middle order, leaving little for the rest.At the end of day three, Pakistan were 213/1, trailing by 208, with their fighting spirit reignited in what has been a rollercoaster Test match.READ ALSO: Shan Masood, Babar Azam register new record for Pakistan against South Africa","Wiaan Mulder threw the ball at Babar Azam, hitting the Pakistani batter.

Jayson will have a responsibility on his shoulders as his fellow teammate Jaylen Brown continues to nurse a right shoulder strain that has sidelined him for two consecutive games.In his previous game, Jaylen Brown scored 12 points, pulled down nine rebounds, and dished out three assists in 25 minutes during the Celtics' resounding 125-71 victory over the Toronto Raptors on December 31. The Celtics' strategy against a Thunder squad on a 14-game winning run may be affected by his possible absence. Jayson Tatum , being in good shape, is crucial for the Boston Celtics. He scored 20 points in the last game against the Houston Rockets. He also got 6 rebounds and 5 assists. If the Celtics want to win tonight against the OKC Thunder, Jayson will have to dish out another stellar performance. This is more necessary as Jaylen might miss the game because of his injury.The Boston Celtics' already difficult game is made more tense by the timing of Jaylen Brown's injury. Brown has played well against Oklahoma City during his career, averaging 18.6 points per game with a shooting efficiency of 45.4% in 13 meetings. He scored 23 points on 9 of 20 shots, pulled down seven rebounds, and dished out four assists in his most recent performance against the Thunder in April of last year.In what has been an otherwise successful season for Brown, the shoulder issue represents a little setback. Should he be cleared to play, his shooting performance against the Thunder in the past, especially his 30% success rate from beyond the arc, indicates space for growth.Because they understand how crucial Brown is to keeping the team competitive against a resurgent Thunder team, Boston Celtics fans are still hopeful about his possible return. Whether Brown can play in what looks to be a fierce cross-conference matchup will depend on the medical staff's final evaluation prior to tipoff.To find out the ultimate decision on Brown's availability, fans who are waiting for updates on his condition can watch the pre-game coverage via any of the broadcast partners.

Curry has been dealing with bilateral knee tendinitis, as a result, he has rested one game in all of the Warriors’ back-to-back fixtures over the past month.The Warriors are taking great care of Curry’s health and have rested him as much as possible this season. Chances are that this is being done to ensure that the Chef is in pristine condition when it’s time for the playoffs. However, Steph’s numbers have taken a dip due to his lack of playing time. At the time of writing, Curry is averaging 22.3 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 6.5 assists per game. He is also shooting 44.7% from the field and 41.8% from three.The Warriors will need Curry for their upcoming game as the Kings have been on a tear lately. Sacramento will come into this one on a three-game winning streak and have all the momentum in the world. Having Steph on the floor will be a big boon as he has historically been good against the Kings. In 46 games against Sacramento Curry has averaged 24.7 points, 6.9 assists, and 5.2 rebounds.Another player that fans should keep their eyes on is Andrew Wiggins. The 29-year-old forward has been in fine form and scored a game-high 24 points against the Grizzlies last night. A big night from Curry and Wiggins might be enough to get the Warriors over the Kings who hold the 11th seed in the Western Conference. It is worth noting that the Warriors will miss Jonathan Kuminga who went down to an ankle injury against the Grizzlies.Kuminga has been developing well and is easily the Warriors’ best scorer behind Stephen Curry. Not having him on the floor tonight could be costly as the Warriors’ bench has been widely inconsistent this season. It’ll be interesting to see what kind of performance Stephen Curry has in store for us against the Sacramento Kings.ALSO READ: Golden State Warriors vs Sacramento Kings (01/05): Starting five, injury report, start time, game prediction, betting tips, how to watch, and more The game between the Sacramento Kings and the Golden State Warriors will kick off from the Chase Center at 8:30 PM ET.

LA Knight Reflects on Unfulfilled NXT Faction Idea

LA Knight , one of WWE's most electrifying performers, recently revealed a unique faction idea he pitched while still in NXT . In a recent interview, the WWE SmackDown star discussed his vision for a group inspired by the popular TV show, The Walking Dead: The Saviors.Speaking with WittyWhitter , Knight explained that he envisioned a faction inspired by the popular television show The Walking Dead. In his concept, a charismatic leader would bring together a group of talented individuals, elevating them to prominence within NXT.""I had thought about this before, actually. I pitched this a few years ago, where i was like, I kind of want guys who are almost downtrodden, who have a lot of potential, but haven't really been used necessarily to the top of the potential. I don't know who those would be now, I think I had names years ago when I was in NXT because I almost wanted to have this... you could say cult. But I was almost thinking of, this was back thinking about like The Walking Dead, like The Saviors or something. One guy at the front, and then there's a lot of guys who are just like, 'all right, wait, this guy is going to be able to get me what I want. I will do anything for him.' Kind of an idea. Other than that, I haven't really put much thought into it, but I mean, if you were going to do like a big three, Miami Heat LeBron super team or something like that, you know, probably, I don't know, me and Cody and Roman or something.""Knight recently made headlines for a minor car accident before a WWE live event in Baltimore. Despite the fender bender, he still managed to deliver a captivating performance, showcasing his dedication to the craft. Currently a prominent figure on Friday Night SmackDown, Knight's future with WWE looks bright. With his charisma, talent, and undeniable star power, he is poised to become one of the company's top stars for years to come.ALSO READ: John Cena vs Cody Rhodes Bout Scheduled for WrestleMania 41: WWE Reports Knight's Walking Dead faction idea, while never realized in NXT, serves as a reminder of his creative vision and his ambition to leave a lasting impact on the wrestling world.

NEW DELHI: An out-of-sorts Indian team succumbed to a six-wicket loss in the fifth and final Test, handing Australia a 3-1 series victory and reclaiming the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after a decade. This defeat, coupled with India's inability to make the World Test Championship final, underscores a period of transition fraught with challenges and questions about the team's direction.Despite flashes of brilliance, India's campaign lacked consistency. Jasprit Bumrah 's 32 wickets in five matches earned him the Player of the Series award, yet his absence due to back spasms in the final Test highlighted India's over-reliance on their star players. Bumrah's absence left the bowling attack toothless, while the batting unit failed to provide the fight required in a high-stakes clash.The series loss marked back-to-back defeats for India, a rarity since 2014. While the players seemed burdened by the weight of expectations, Virat Kohli , in what could be his last Test on Australian soil, garnered attention for his ""sandpaper gesture,"" a move that Australian media widely criticized but dismissed as irrelevant to the outcome.The Australian press, in contrast, celebrated their team's triumph with unrestrained praise. The Sydney Morning Herald emphasized Australia's resilience: ""Australia responded in emphatic and clinical fashion, going on to win three of the next four matches and consigning India to back-to-back series defeats for the first time since 2014.""News.com.au ignited debate by dubbing this Australian team the ""greatest ever,"" crediting captain Pat Cummins for completing a collection of every major cricketing trophy. The outlet remarked: ""Cummins' legacy is quickly becoming a guy who just wins things for fun.""It also took note of Kohli's actions during the Sydney Test, stating, ""Virat Kohli then elected to fire up the crowd with a bizarre sandpaper gesture, the act raised eyebrows but it didn't do anything to stop the Aussies.""The ABC Sport called the series win ""the defining moment of the Pat Cummins era,"" remarking on Australia's historic comeback after an opening-Test loss. ""This is now the defining victory of the Pat Cummins era,"" it declared.The Weekend Australian credited Australia's ""cult heroes"" for the victory while hinting at India's flawed planning: ""India might have been better off if some of their heroes had stayed at home.""Meanwhile, The Courier Mail criticized Kohli's antics, labeling them as a parting shot from a ""pantomime villain.""For India, the series defeat raises pressing concerns.

Jauan Jennings and Sean Murphy-Bunting were ejected after an altercation

San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Jauan Jennings and Arizona Cardinals cornerback Sean Murphy-Bunting were ejected for fighting during Sunday's season finale. Jennings was out of the game after being thrown in the second quarter and ended 25 yards shy of his first career 1,000-yard season. Neither team needed to win as they were eliminated from the playoffs before Sunday's kickoff.Jauan Jennings, a standout player for the San Francisco 49ers, had a successful season despite a down year. However, his season ended abruptly in Week 18, just before he reached a significant milestone. Jennings was ejected in the first quarter of the Niners' final game against the Arizona Cardinals, after getting into a fight with cornerback Sean Murphy-Bunting.The Cardinals were up 10-3 in the second fight. Quarterback Joshua Dobbs finished a run play, and Jennings blocked a Murphy-Bunting pass, which was not appreciated by the Arizona Cardinals. Jennings and Murphy-Bunting wrestled after the game ended. They fell to the turf and fought after the whistle blew. Two officials tried to pull the players apart, but after some time, they managed with the help of players from both teams. The flag was tossed by an official that neither of the players accepted.Jennings and Murphy-Bunting's seasons ended after offsetting personal fouls and ejections. Jennings drew his second penalty in two plays, sparking a scuffle with Thomas. Patrick Taylor Jr. drove Thomas to the turf on a 9-yard run, and both players continued to wrestle after the game. The scuffle led to penalties for Jennings and Taylor, but no one was ejected. The second fight led to Jennings' ejection, and Murphy-Bunting wasn't even warned.Jennings, a fourth-year receiver, was excluded from the NFL for failing to reach a career milestone. He tallied 923 yards on 70 receptions and seven catches for 52 yards on an active day, but he left the field with a smile to greet 49ers fans in the stands at State Farm Stadium, Arizona.Also Read: “Going to mess this up”: NFL on Fox analyst Daryl Johnston channeled the inner fear of every Bears fan watching the game vs the Packers Jennings' 2024 performance was a bright spot for the 49ers, as he stepped up after losing starting wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk due to an ACL injury. He proved to be a reliable primary target, catching 77 passes for 975 yards and six touchdowns. Jennings solidified himself as a significant player in the 49ers' offense, potentially reaching the 1,000-yard mark soon.

Daryl Johnston was concerned about the Bears' ability to mess up immediately before a critical fumble

The Chicago Bears ended their season with a win over the Green Bay Packers , thanks to Caleb Williams ' clean play and the defense's resilience. Fans who aren't fixated on draft positioning can appreciate the timing of Daryl Johnston 's play in the fourth quarter, as the Bears needed a single first down to score, a feat that has been challenging for their inconsistent team.The Chicago Bears have lost games this season in just about every fashion imaginable: a Hail Mary touchdown, a blocked field goal, and clock mismanagement. Even with an 84.4% chance of winning, according to ESPN analytics, with the Bears leading 21-19 and having a first down at midfield with 1:55 left, Johnston tapped into the inner fear of every Bears fan watching the game.“Every Bears fan is watching this going, ‘Oh my gosh. How are we going to mess this up?'” Daryl Johnston said. Less than five seconds later, Bears QB Caleb Williams completed a pass to D.J. Moore, who immediately fumbled. The Packers recovered. “D.J. Moore with the catch — he fumbles the football!” play-by-play man Kevin Kugler called. “And it’s recovered by Green Bay. The answer to Daryl Johnston’s question is a fumble.” “I didn’t mean for it to happen, actually,” Johnston said in an apologetic tone.The Packers led by a 22-21 margin, but the Bears proved they still had much life left when they marched 47 yards in less than one minute to set up a game-winning field goal, ending a 10-game losing streak. Johnston did not rephrase his question before the field-goal attempt.Green Bay Packers quarterback Jordan Love said he's lost feeling in his throwing hand, but believes it won't impact his availability for the playoffs. Love said the injury shouldn't be lingering and should resolve by the start of the postseason. The Packers, the No. 7 seed in the NFC, will play a wild-card game against Philadelphia. “It’s feeling better,” Love said.Coach Matt LaFleur suggested Love could return to the Bears game if needed, as he was taking warm up tosses on the sideline after Malik Willis injured his hand. “Once Malik said he was good to go, we felt like that was the route we wanted to go,” LaFleur said.The Packers enter the playoffs with major concerns after a two-game skid, thanks to injuries to two of their top playmakers. But they may have dodged a major bullet with Love. Green Bay's coach, LaFleur, was in a no-win situation when deciding whether to rest starters or play them in the regular-season finale. Green Bay's biggest deep threat for the postseason is likely lost.Also Read: Three takeaways from the Kansas City Chiefs' 38-0 loss to Broncos, who enters postseason party for the first time since 2015 season Watson sat out the Packers' 27-25 loss to Minnesota with an injured left knee, possibly including his right.

NEW DELHI: Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar was no less than furious after India succumbed to a six-wicket defeat against Australia in Sydney on Sunday.The win enabled Australia to win the series 3-1 and reclaim the coveted Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the first time since 2014-15.This victory also put the Aussies into the World Test Championship final in June at Lord's against South Africa.In a video that is viral on social media, Gavaskar, flanked by former India pacer Irfan Pathan , can be seen speaking to the host broadcaster after the match.When asked by the presenter about what India should do to improve after the series defeat, Gavaskar says, ""Who are we? We don't know cricket. We just speak just for the sake of TV and get money, don't listen to us, we're nothing. Listen from one ear, remove from another.""This is not the first time that Gavaskar has criticized the Indian cricketers.Gavaskar had slammed Rishabh Pant for his irresponsible shot-selection in a situation when the team needed him to build a partnership on Day 3 of the fourth Test against Australia in Melbourne.Trying to manufacture an audacious ramp shot with India's score reading 191 for 5 in response to Australia's 474, Pant was caught at deep third-man for 28 -- gifting his wicket to Scott Boland .""Stupid!

Pull Shots Cover Drives

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

South African great AB de Villiers offered advice to his friend Virat Kohli following a challenging tour of Australia. Kohli struggled against deliveries outside the off-stump, particularly those bowled by Scott Boland .India lost the Border-Gavaskar Trophy to Australia, ending a 10-year winning streak. The final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground saw Australia win by six wickets, sealing the series 1-3.Kohli's performance throughout the series was underwhelming. He scored only 190 runs in nine innings, averaging 23.75. His sole century, an unbeaten 100, came in the first Test at Perth.While this century initially raised hopes, Kohli's form dipped significantly in subsequent matches. His scores included 7 and 11 in Adelaide, 3 in Brisbane, 36 and 5 in Melbourne, and 17 and 6 in Sydney.De Villiers, in a video shared on X, suggested that Kohli needs to ""reset his mind."" He emphasized the importance of moving past individual on-field battles.""I think the thing is to reset your mind, every time. I think with Virat, he gets involved with the battle on the field. That is one of his biggest strengths and it can also be a weakness. During this series, we saw him have individual battles with some of the players, the crowd got under his skin. Virat loves the fight, but when you are not in the form of your life, it is best to get rid of those things. As a batter, it is to reset every single and realize every ball is an event and just forget about the bowler,"" he said.""I think sometimes Virat forgets about that because of his fighting spirit and the nature of the man wanting to be involved and show the whole of India he is there to fight for them. The skill, experience and greatness of the guy are not an issue. It's about the refocus after every single ball. Maybe sometimes he gets too involved,"" De Villiers added.He acknowledged Kohli's fighting spirit and desire to represent India with passion. However, De Villiers suggested that Kohli needs to refocus after every ball and avoid excessive engagement.Kohli's overall performance in the ICC World Test Championship 2023-25 cycle was also analyzed. He amassed 751 runs in 14 matches at an average of 32.65, including two centuries and three fifties. His highest score was 121.The current 2024-25 Test season has been particularly difficult for Kohli. He has managed only 382 runs in 10 matches, averaging 22.87 with a single century and a fifty.Kohli's form since the start of 2020 has been a concern. In 39 matches, he has scored 2,028 runs at an average of 30.72, with three centuries and nine fifties. His highest score during this period is 186.","India lost the Border-Gavaskar Trophy to Australia, ending a 10-year winning streak. Virat Kohli scored only 190 runs in nine innings, averaging 23.75.

While he has often been sidelined, his teammate Paul George recently shared that despite injury concerns of several players in the team, they have been hopeful as they have a strong chemistry that will eventually help overcome all the odds.The Philadelphia 76ers currently have 14 wins and 19 defeats so far, however, the optimism in the team is still intact as Paul George has recently shared new details of the team’s chemistry. In a recent interview, the 34-year-old candidly reflected on the injury concern in the team, “The injuries just haven’t been on our side, but I think we’re gelling,” George said following their latest road trip.George went on to add that the teammates have been in good coordination, We’re starting to enjoy each other out on the floor. The stuff off the court is starting to trickle on the court, and that’s a great sign.”From the point of view of George, the most important thing is bonding and good communication. Despite their concerning winning statistics this season, George is certainly optimistic for the team’s future. “We should have easily gone 5-1 this trip. But more than anything, we gelled, we bonded. It was just great for us to be together. Road trips are really where teams come out strong,” he added.The 76ers are showing signs of improvement. Embiid leading the charge with MVP-level performances on both ends of the floor. Tyrese Maxey has stepped up, taking on greater responsibilities in clutch moments. Meanwhile, George's leadership has been key in keeping the team focused. But the challenges for the team are far from fading away as Embiid’s back-to-back injuries have been a major concern and Maxey and George have a bigger responsibility on the court to deal with if Emiid’s absence occurs again in the near future.Embiid has played the Sixers’ latest game against the Brooklyn Nets claiming the 123-94 victory. The Cameroonian-American star led the team to victory with 28 points, 6 assists, and 12 rebounds while Maxey and George added 18 and 17 points respectively.Also Read: Anthony Davis records NBA history against Rockets Up next, the Sixers are set to face the Phoenix Suns on January 6 in a highly anticipated matchup but they already have three players listed as questionable for the upcoming game. Joel Embiid, dealing with a left foot sprain and sinus fracture; Kyle Lowry, struggling with right hip soreness; and Kelly Oubre Jr., who is recovering from a left hand sprain. The injury concern remains in the team and other players must step up to fill the void of these players making a wave of impact if the Sixers are planning to have their dominance on the court.","The Philadelphia 76ers have been riddled with back-to-back injuries, especially, their star player Joel Embiid.

Iron Man streak or stat padding? Josh Allen’s limited playtime against Patriots raises questions about Bills’ decision-making,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/iron-man-streak-or-stat-padding-josh-allens-limited-playtime-against-patriots-raises-questions-about-bills-decision-making/articleshow/116979076.cms,"Credit: AP Photos

Bills’ Strategy Questioned as Josh Allen's Brief Patriots Appearance Spurs Debate



The Buffalo Bills secured their fifth consecutive AFC East title and clinched the No. 2 seed in the playoffs before facing the New England Patriots in Week 18. Quarterback Josh Allen , in the midst of his best season yet, entered the final regular-season game with 3,731 passing yards, 28 touchdowns, 531 rushing yards, and 12 rushing touchdowns. His MVP-worthy performance is undeniable. As Allen played through the game despite concerns about his health, he made NFL history but also faced criticism for exiting early.Josh Allen, the quarterback of the Buffalo Bills, made news on Sunday when he chose to play in the defeat against the New England Patriots. Most people thought that Allen would have to rest for playoffs. However, he ensured that his remarkable streak of consecutive starts continues: now it stands at 105 regular-season starts and 115 including the playoffs. This decision, however, drew mixed reactions from fans and commentators alike.During the game, Allen led the Bills onto the field to start, only to exit shortly after, handing the ball off to running back James Cook before quickly making his way to the sidelines. This brief appearance was enough to extend his streak, but it left many questioning the rationale behind the decision. CBS Sports play-by-play announcer Spero Dedes summed it up succinctly, calling it a “quick day at the office” for Allen.For the Bills, the game didn’t hold much significance as they had already secured the No. 2 seed in the AFC, and key starters were rested for the playoff push. Yet, the decision to feature Allen for a single play raised eyebrows, with some fans criticizing it as a ""shameless"" attempt to pad his consecutive start streak. One fan took to social media, saying, ""Starting for one play is crazy,"" while another quipped, ""Lame… Should have to play an entire quarter.""The criticism wasn’t limited to fans. Some argued that this move was an unnecessary play for a meaningless game. “You know who wouldn’t play 1 play to keep his consecutive starts record alive? Patrick Mahomes,” one fan stated, indirectly calling out Allen's approach.While Allen’s streak is undeniably impressive, it's more than double that of the next closest quarterback, Jared Goff, who had 51 consecutive starts before the Sunday night game. Allen’s 115 consecutive starts now place him 13th on the all-time list for quarterbacks. To put things into perspective, the record for the most consecutive starts is held by Green Bay Packers legend Brett Favre, with an astonishing 294 starts, which includes the playoffs.Also Read: “Going to mess this up”: NFL on Fox analyst Daryl Johnston channeled the inner fear of every Bears fan watching the game vs the Packers Although the brief appearance has stirred controversy, it was just part of the Bills' plan to make sure Allen would stay healthy and continue that run-all without risking injury before the playoffs. Allen is set for January 12 when the team opens NFL Wildcard action against the Denver Broncos, although he will surely turn his focus to a longer playoff run because he will be part of the competition for the 2024 NFL MVP against Lamar Jackson.","Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen made NFL history on Sunday when he played against the New England Patriots.

As the match ended, cricket memes went viral on social media platforms. Here are some of the viral memes that just capture the emotion/sadness of Indian Cricket fans.

Record number of spectators

Australia clinched a thrilling 184-run victory over India in a dramatic final session of the fourth Test in Melbourne, taking a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. India, needing 340 to win, collapsed to 155 all out, losing their last seven wickets for just 34 runs in 20.3 overs. India appeared to be heading for a draw after Yashasvi Jaiswal (84) and Rishabh Pant (30) steered them to 112-3 at tea. However, Pant's dismissal, attempting a six off Travis Head, triggered a batting collapse.Controversy arose with Jaiswal's dismissal. Initially given not out to a caught-behind appeal, the TV umpire overturned the decision based on visual evidence of the ball changing direction, despite the absence of audible noise. Jasprit Bumrah was exceptional for India, taking 5-57 in the second innings and nine wickets in the match. He had reduced Australia to 91-6 at one stage, a lead of less than 200.The match set a record attendance for cricket in Australia, with 373,591 spectators. Head described the atmosphere as inspiring and hailed the match as one of the best he has been involved in. India now needs to win the final Test in Sydney to level the series and retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .","Australia beat India by 184 runs in the fourth Test in Melbourne.

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

SYDNEY: The regular captain who sat out, and the stand-in who hobbled away. Nothing went right for India at the SCG and their campaign was mired in disappointment from start to finish.The biggest blow of all was the sight of Jasprit Bumrah walking out of the ground due to back spasms on Day Two. He would play no further role with ball in hand, neutering India's capabilities and sparking a quick defeat.This has been the Jasprit Bumrah Series, bookended by ecstasy in Perth and agony here at the SCG. Throughout, the side's complete dependence on him has sparked concern. The signs were there right from the second Test in Adelaide, when he experienced some groin discomfort and cramps. The incessant rain in Brisbane then allowed some breathing space before the immense workload at the MCG, where he bowled 53.2 overs, eventually led to breakdown.""It's a little frustrating, but sometimes you've got to respect your body. You can't fight your body,"" Bumrah told the official broadcaster after the day's play. ""It's a little disappointing in the end because I probably missed out on the spiciest wicket of the series. That's the way it is. Sometimes you've to accept it and move forward.""Bumrah bowled a back-breaking 151.2 overs across the five Tests, an immense burden for a bowler with an unorthodox action off a short run up. In Bumrah's absence, Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj proved woefully inadequate in defending India's 162-run target on Sunday, even on the helpful SCG pitch. Head coach Gautam Gambhir , however, praised Siraj's attitude after the day's play.""Bumrah did everything possible,"" Gambhir said. ""He led the attack really well. He bowled a lot of overs. He took wickets. But there's been help from the other end as well. From Bumrah's point of view, he had a phenomenal series, (but) he was helped by Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Harshit Rana in the first two Tests.""Bumrah himself said the younger lot would emerge from the tour better equipped to handle pressure. ""It was a well-fought series, (there are) a lot of learnings for us. A lot of ifs and buts but it was not like it was totally one-sided,"" he said.""Being in the game for longer, creating pressure, absorbing pressure, playing to the situation, all these learnings are important. Young players come up having success in a certain way, but in Test cricket you've to adapt, make your game work in a different manner. These learnings will help us in the future.""The talk on Bumrah's leadership capabilities will no doubt gain pace ahead of the England series in five months' time. For now, it's time to let his wondrous wicket-taking capabilities sink in.""It's the best individual performance I've seen in Test cricket,"" Australia's Travis Head gushed. ""Bumrah is a great performer.""",Jasprit Bumrah bowled a back-breaking 151.2 overs across the five Tests.

'Kohli, Rohit future up to them'

'Need to be fair to everyone'

'Not the results we've been expecting'

'Give importance to domestic cricket'

SYDNEY: The SCG pitch finds itself in the eye of a storm after a recent relay altered its usually benign nature, but it has a fan in India's head coach Gautam Gambhir , who feels such surfaces are important since they challenge batters, bring the bowlers into play and induce results.""It's been some really nice wickets (overall in the series),"" Gambhir said, ""It's good for Test cricket. There was enough for the bowlers, enough for batters as well. This is how Test cricket needs to be played, (on) result-oriented wickets. We talk a lot about turning pitches back home. This was as spicy as what we get back home,"" Gambhir said.Gambhir's stance was in stark contrast to that of former captain Sunil Gavaskar , who said the conditions were ""not ideal"". ""When I saw the pitch, I did say the cows could have gone and grazed on it,"" Gavaskar said on ABC Radio. ""This is not the pitch you want because you want it to go to the fourth or fifth day. Former players who've played here were so surprised. If 15 wickets fell a day in India, there would be hell.""Gambhir, however, said, ""Everything boils down to the temperament, how much you want to play out those tough moments. Test cricket is all about playing out the sessions, seeing off a (good) spell. That's one issue we need to look at, how we can convert those 40s into big hundreds and set the game for our bowlers.""Asked about the roadmap for Tests ahead of the England series in July and the fate of struggling senior batters like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli , Gambhir said, ""I can't talk about the future of any player. It's up to them as well. They still have the hunger and passion. Hopefully they can continue to take Indian cricket forward. But ultimately, we all know, whatever they plan, they'll plan in the best interests of Indian cricket. It's about whether the team is moving forward with your contribution, or not. There are very honest players in that dressing room.""Gambhir refused to clarify if the England tour would see wholesale changes in the squad. ""It's not the right time. A lot of things change in sport. Form, people, attitude, everything changes. Five months is a long time,"" he said.On a related note, Gambhir also said he would not be doing justice to his role as head coach if he favoured certain reputations over others. ""My biggest responsibility is that I have to be fair to everyone in the room. If I'm fair to only two or three individuals, I'm being dishonest in my job. Whether a player hasn't made his debut yet, or whether he has played 100 Tests, I have to be equal to everyone.""Gambhir has had a rocky start to his international coaching career, with India having lost six out of 10 Tests under him, including the 0-3 series whitewash at home to New Zealand and now the three defeats in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy here.""It's been tough and obviously not the results we've been expecting,"" he said, ""All I can expect from that dressing room is to keep fighting, stay honest, but ultimately it's a result-oriented sport.""Gambhir also welcomed suggestions that India's Test batters should play on the domestic first-class circuit, saying, ""I'd like everyone to play domestic cricket. If you don't give importance to domestic cricket, you'll never get the desired players at the Test level.""","Gautam Gambhir says SCG pitch is good for Test cricket.

LIVE from Sydney: Gautam Gambhir’s explosive remarks after SCG defeat, plans for seniors, team plan

Sydney: When the defeat was in plain sight, India's stand-in captain walked out of the dressing room during the team's bowling for the final time in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy . He took the seat next to regular captain Rohit Sharma and both helplessly sat as Australia went past the finish line.The look on Bumrah's face said it all.The bowler who gave his all in the first four Tests, and the first innings at the Sydney Cricket Ground, wasn't able to have one final go at the Australians as a back spasm kept him away. There were 50-50 chances, and they increased the moment he came out to bat, but it still wasn't enough to have him doing what he has done in the entire series - torment the batters. He had the whites on, elbows rested on the knees and he stooped a bit forward to watch the last few overs of the Australian run-chase.Not many were on the board to defend and it was always going to be difficult to make a contest with just two proper bowlers and three fillers. The four wickets did make it a bit interesting and injected some life into the changing room but it was short-lived as perennial tormentor Travis Head, along with debutant Beau Webster, overhauled the target in just 27 overs.The celebrations in the opposite camp began as Bumrah descended the stairs for the customary handshakes. Right behind him was regular captain Rohit, still in his training gear, as the visitors dragged themselves off the field after a long tour Down Under.A series which started with the high in Perth ended with a lot of disappointment in Sydney. India, under Bumrah and Rohit and even Virat, had their little moments but it was Australia's regular capitalisation of the crucial junctures which helped them end the decade-long wait for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.The five-Test series challenged both sets of players, physically and mentally, and India saw the exit of one of their greatest match winners in R Ashwin. Rohit, too, didn't feature in the final Test as questions were continuously raised on the future of ageing superstars in that dressing room, which doesn't look happy anymore.And why would it. Coach Gautam Gambhir had said a few months back that a winning dressing room is a happy dressing room but that hasn't been the case in the last eight Tests. They have won just one, yes just one fixture, and were saved by rain in Brisbane. The head coach admitted it's been tough but lauded the entire bunch for the fight they put in the last two months.""Yeah, it's been tough. Absolutely no doubt about it. It's been really tough and obviously these weren't the results we were expecting in the last eight Test matches but that is what sport is all about. All I can expect from that dressing room is to keep fighting and all we all can do is to be honest and keep fighting and keep doing the right things. What is good for Indian cricket is as simple as it can get but more importantly it's a result oriented sport and we all play for results and it hasn't gone our way as simple as it can be,"" says Gambhir.While there are plenty of questions left to be answered, there are some important ones on the future of both Rohit and Kohli. Gambhir, for now, didn't have an answer to that and emphasised that it's up to the players also.""See I can't talk about the future of any player, it's up to them as well. But yes, what I can say is that they still have the hunger, they still have the passion, they're tough people and hopefully they can continue to take Indian cricket forward but ultimately as we all know that whatever they plan, they will plan for the best interest of Indian cricket,"" said Gambhir.There's still time before India play their next Test, against England in England in June, but for now the coach needs to ensure that the dressing room remains a happy dressing room for the road ahead.""Happiness will always be intact. Because the reason is that all we can do is try and prepare to the best of our ability, try and be 100% committed on the field, not only on that particular day, every session, every hour, every ball. If you're committed to what we are doing with honesty, I think that should be fine.""I have to be absolutely honest and equal and fair to everyone in that dressing room. I know we haven't got the results and it is frustrating. I'm not saying it's not frustrating. It is challenging. But whatever we can do with the best interest of Indian cricket, that will continue to happen in the dressing room,"" explained Gambhir.It wasn't a happy sight to see the dropping shoulders towards the closing moments of the game and Gambhir has his task cut out that the side returns to winning, and remains on happy ways.","India's stand-in captain walked out of the dressing room during the team's bowling for the final time in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

IND vs AUS: Rishabh Pant on dropped Rohit Sharma, criticism, Jasprit Bumrah

NEW DELHI: If the opening day of the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground was dramatic, Day 2 brought even more high-octane action. After bowling out India for a modest 185 on a grassy SCG pitch, Australia found themselves in trouble at the start of their first innings. Jasprit Bumrah , who dismissed Usman Khawaja late on Day 1, struck again early on Day 2 by removing Marnus Labuschagne. Mohammed Siraj then took center stage, producing a game-changing over that left Australia reeling.Siraj’s first breakthrough came with a superb outswinger to Sam Konstas, who drove with hard hands and edged it to Yashasvi Jaiswal at gully, where a stunning catch was taken.Siraj followed it up with another outswinger, this time slightly shorter, which induced a thick edge from Travis Head. The ball flew to KL Rahul at second slip, who made no mistake.Siraj was visibly pumped after his two-wicket burst, with Virat Kohli joining the celebrations in trademark fashion—jumping and pumping his fists with enthusiasm.Kohli then turned to the crowd, waving his arms to fire them up, adding to the electrifying atmosphere at the SCG.Australia, leading 2-1, need a win or a draw to reclaim the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after a decade.

Gautam Gambhir on India XI for SCG Test, dressing room unity and more

Another controversy erupted early on the first morning of the fifth Test between India and Australia in Sydney when a relay catch involving Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne off Virat Kohli 's bat was ruled by the third umpire as not legitimate.With Indian openers KL Rahul (4) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (10) dismissed early, India were 17 for 2 when Kohli came in to bat and edged the first ball he faced from Scott Boland to the slips, where the Aussie players claimed the relay catch between Smith and Labuschagne.Diving low to his right, Smith believed to have got his fingers underneath the ball before lobbing it in the air for Labuschagne to complete the catch. The decision was referred by the on-field umpires for review, and the third umpire ruled that the ball grazed the ground before Smith lobbed it back up.Talking to Fox Cricket at the lunch break, Smith said he has no doubt that it was a clean catch, but they have to accept the decision taken by the match officials.""Did you get your hand underneath that ball?"" former England player turned commentator Isa Guha asked Smith?""100%, no denying it whatsoever. But the umpires made the decision, and we move on,"" replied Smith.After replays were shown on the giant screen and the third umpire announced his view, Kohli was seen shaking his head with a wry smile on his face.India went to lunch at a shaky 57 for 3, losing Shubman Gill (20) off the last ball delivered by off-spinner Nathan Lyon before the break, leaving Kohli on the crease at 20 not out. He was joined by Rishabh Pant post lunch.Earlier, India left captain Rohit Sharma out of the eleven, with Jasprit Bumrah doing the leadership duty and chose to bat first after winning the toss.India made two changes to their team.

2nd Test: Rashid Khan's spin masterclass puts Afghanistan on verge of victory over Zimbabwe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/2nd-test-rashid-khans-spin-masterclass-puts-afghanistan-on-verge-of-victory-over-zimbabwe/articleshow/116971024.cms,"(ACB Photo)

Afghanistan's leg-spinner Rashid Khan 's remarkable six-wicket haul has placed his team on the cusp of victory against Zimbabwe in the decisive second Test match in Bulawayo.At the end of the fourth day, Zimbabwe found themselves struggling at 205 for 8 in their second innings, still needing 73 runs to reach their target. The match has seen fluctuating fortunes for both sides.Rashid Khan, who had already taken four wickets for 94 runs in the first innings, ended the day with impressive figures of 6 for 66 in the second innings.A prominent figure in T20 cricket, Rashid, playing in only his sixth Test match, achieved his fifth five-wicket haul and his third ten-wicket match haul.Ismat Alam, making his Test debut, scored a century (101 runs), propelling Afghanistan to a total of 363 all out in their second innings, and setting Zimbabwe a target of 276 runs.
