Though the game ended in a devastating 6-1 loss, Bieber posted a tribute that reminded fans of his unwavering support:“I don’t remember a time in my life when I haven’t been obsessed with the leafsssss,” he wrote. “This year we made it farther than we have in so long and I’m happy about that.

Why Al Horford Makes Sense for the Milwaukee Bucks

Theare reportedly interested in adding a seasoned veteran to their frontcourt in the form of, according to a report from NBA insider Marc J. Spears. With Horford expected to part ways with the Boston Celtics this offseason, Milwaukee joins a list of contenders keeping close tabs on the 39-year-old center.The Milwaukee Bucks are coming off a busy summer that saw them secure Myles Turner on a four-year, $108.9 million deal. While Turner is expected to anchor the frontcourt, the addition of Al Horford would offer the team a reliable and experienced backup, strengthening Milwaukee’s frontcourt rotation with both size and floor-spacing.Despite his age, Horford remains a valuable contributor. During the 2024–25 NBA season, he played 60 regular-season games for Boston, starting in 42. He averaged:Horford also played a key role in helping the Celtics win the 2024 NBA Championship, reinforcing his value as a playoff-tested contributor.The Milwaukee Bucks aren’t alone in their pursuit. According to Marc J. Spears, several teams remain in the mix: “Golden State expected him to sign last week — he didn’t,” Spears said. “Lakers, Milwaukee, Atlanta, I believe, are also interested.” (H/t: Sporting News)While the Golden State Warriors were initially considered frontrunners, Horford’s delay in signing suggests he is still weighing his options. The Los Angeles Lakers and Atlanta Hawks are also reportedly in the running, making it a competitive market for the veteran’s services.Here’s why the Milwaukee Bucks may see Al Horford as a perfect fit:- Locker Room Leadership: With a young supporting cast being assembled around Giannis Antetokounmpo, Horford’s playoff experience and professionalism could be a steadying influence.- Floor Spacing: His ability to knock down threes adds a different dimension to the Bucks’ offense, especially when Giannis attacks the paint.- Defensive Versatility: While no longer at his peak, Horford remains a capable team defender who can switch, help, and rotate effectively.Milwaukee’s interest in Horford highlights a smart approach to building a title-contending roster around its superstar. As they aim for a deeper playoff run in 2025–26, adding a proven winner like Horford could be the subtle but strategic move that makes a significant difference.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors predicted to land $250 million Phoenix Suns star guard as potential backcourt partner for Stephen Curry As of now, Al Horford remains unsigned, and the Milwaukee Bucks, along with other suitors, will await his decision.

Pittsburgh Penguins could be back in the hands of Mario Lemieux in a dramatic ownership move



Mario Lemieux, a name etched deeply into Pittsburgh Penguins history, could be preparing for a stunning return—this time off the ice. According to The Athletic, Lemieux is reportedly “very interested” in buying back the Penguins alongside former co-owner Ron Burkle and ex-CEO Dave Morehouse, now serving as an advisor with the Pittsburgh Steelers.This potential move follows Fenway Sports Group’s (FSG) 2021 acquisition of the franchise in a $900 million deal. While FSG has maintained that it’s only exploring a “minority investment,” Lemieux’s group is said to be actively evaluating financial options to regain control. “We’ve seen the speculation, and as we’ve previously shared with media, Fenway Sports Group is currently engaged in a process to explore a potential minority investment in the Pittsburgh Penguins,” FSG said in a statement. However, many see this as an opening Lemieux could eventually capitalize on.The timing couldn’t be more fitting. Since the franchise changed hands, the Penguins have struggled. Pittsburgh failed to reach the playoffs in the last two seasons after a 15-year streak, and ticket sales have dropped to just 91.4% of capacity, an all-time low in the Sidney Crosby era. With fan enthusiasm fading and on-ice performance waning, a return to Lemieux-led ownership could breathe new life into the franchise.Lemieux’s legacy isn’t just about goals and assists—it’s about saving hockey in Pittsburgh. From leading the team to back-to-back Stanley Cup wins in 1991 and 1992, to stepping in with controlling interest when the franchise was bankrupt, Lemieux has twice resurrected the Penguins. He even returned to play in 2000, taking the team on an unexpected journey to the Eastern Conference Final while also serving as owner.With valuations of NHL franchises soaring—Forbes now pegs the Penguins at $1.75 billion—buying back the team won’t come cheap. But Lemieux’s group is reportedly hoping FSG will entertain a “reasonable” deal, especially given the team’s recent struggles and potential for league-wide revenue boosts from future expansion.Lemieux, who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1997 before his comeback, last suited up during Crosby’s rookie season. He later watched Crosby lead the team to a Stanley Cup in 2009, under Lemieux’s ownership.If this comeback materializes, it won’t just be about business. For Lemieux, it’s about passion, legacy, and rescuing the Penguins once more when they need it most.Also Read: ""Lot of anxiety"": Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau’s sister opens up about ‘anxiety’ and heartbreak as she finally gets married after the tragic loss of both brothers","Mario Lemieux is reportedly ""very interested"" in buying back the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Jada Mclean left an unforgettable mark on the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders — not only for her powerful performances over five seasons but for the role she played in changing the game off the field. As season 2 of Netflix's America's Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders revealed, Mclean helped lead the squad’s push for fairer compensation. But in a surprise twist, just as their efforts finally paid off with a 400% salary increase, Mclean made the emotional decision to retire.The Palm Springs native worked her way to the top of the DCC ranks, eventually becoming first group leader — a role that required mentorship, choreography assistance, and strong team communication. Mclean was a standout not just for her dance skills but for her voice.Speaking of the team's successful compensation battle, she said: ""'Happy' isn't even the right word for it. [It] kind of felt like a relief, like everything had paid off ... finally we were done fighting.""Still, despite the long-awaited victory, Mclean confirmed her departure from the team during the uniform return ceremony. “I’m just looking forward to what’s next for me in life, and give it my all like I did when I was here,” she told director Kelli Finglass and choreographer Judy Trammell.It was a tearful farewell that signaled not just the end of an era, but a promising new beginning.Since retiring, Mclean hasn’t stepped away from the spotlight entirely. She’s traveled across the U.S. and Mexico, appeared at the ACM Awards, and even returned for limited promotional performances as part of the DCC On Tour and media appearances for the docuseries.In a May TikTok video, she opened up about her dreams beyond cheerleading: “I have thought about going into modeling after my DCC career comes to an end...

Jets’ $130 million Garrett Wilson extension draws praise — but the contract’s secret weapon is genius,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jets-130-million-garrett-wilson-extension-draws-praise-but-the-contracts-secret-weapon-is-genius/articleshow/122472423.cms,"Jets' Garrett Wilson contract extension (Getty Images)

Inside Garrett Wilson’s $130M Jets deal: One brilliant detail changes everything



In a bold move that speaks volumes about their long-term ambitions, the New York Jets have officially locked in one of their brightest stars. On Monday, NFL insider Adam Schefter reported that wide receiver Garrett Wilson has signed a groundbreaking 4-year, $130 million extension with the Jets—featuring a stunning $90 million guaranteed. This deal not only reaffirms the Jets' belief in Wilson but also marks NFL history, as he's now the first receiver to average $31 million annually after just three professional seasons.The 24-year-old Ohio State product has earned every bit of this payday. Since entering the league, Wilson has delivered three straight 1,000-yard seasons, including a career-best 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns in 2024. He’s amassed 279 catches for 3,249 yards over his young career, remaining both consistent and durable—despite playing without a true franchise quarterback.What makes this extension even more impressive is its timing and structure. With the Jets exercising Wilson's fifth-year option, his new deal won’t kick in until 2027. That means the team has effectively secured one of the league’s premier receivers through the 2030 season. As ESPN’s Rich Cimini highlighted, “New York now owes Wilson $150.3 million over the next six seasons,” which averages out to a manageable $25.05 million annually—an absolute bargain for elite production at a premium position.While his $32.5 million average places him fifth among NFL receivers—behind Ja’Marr Chase, Justin Jefferson, CeeDee Lamb, and DK Metcalf—Wilson's deal is a win for the Jets. In a league where young stars are expected to reset the market, this contract gives New York top-tier talent without blowing up their cap flexibility. More importantly, it helps the Jets avoid future standoffs and public negotiations that often plague high-profile extensions.The timing also aligns perfectly with another significant storyline: Wilson will be reunited in 2025 with his former Ohio State quarterback, Justin Fields. This long-anticipated pairing could finally give Wilson the consistent quarterback connection he’s lacked. While Fields may not be a guaranteed fix, the chemistry from their college days offers hope.So far, Wilson has looked every bit like a superstar in the making—held back only by instability at quarterback. His route running, hands, and explosiveness have never been questioned. The Jets, by committing early, are betting on his best years still being ahead.For a franchise often marred by misfortune and missed opportunities, this extension signals something rare: hope with purpose. Garrett Wilson is staying in East Rutherford—and the Jets might finally be building something worth watching.Also Read: ""We get to talk once a week"": Jason Kelce hails Travis as a ‘great uncle’ and the ‘best friend’ he could ever ask for","The New York Jets have signed wide receiver Garrett Wilson to a four-year, $130 million contract extension.

Despite Hailee Steinfeld ’s support, Josh Allen’s struggles against Patrick Mahomes

The Buffalo Bills may be perennial contenders, but as long as Patrick Mahomes wears red and gold, they remain firmly under his shadow. Despite a strong regular season and an MVP campaign from Josh Allen, the Bills have consistently fallen short in January — especially when facing the Kansas City Chiefs. Allen is now 0-4 in playoff games against Mahomes, a stat that looms large heading into the 2025 NFL season.The latest blow came in the 2024 AFC Championship Game, where Allen once again came up short. Despite leading a high-powered offense and having Hollywood’s Hailee Steinfeld cheering him on, the Wyoming-born quarterback has yet to overcome the Mahomes-sized wall standing between Buffalo and a Super Bowl return. The last time the Bills reached the big game was in 1993 — and Allen’s era has yet to change that.While Mahomes didn’t hit his usual 4,000-yard passing mark last season and threw just 26 touchdowns, ESPN analyst Harry Douglas issued a stark warning: “I think they are going to need a little help from someone else in the AFC. And what I mean by that is, they are 0-4 against the Kansas City Chiefs in the playoffs. They need someone else to knock off the Chiefs before they actually face them in a playoff game.”It’s a brutal truth, and one that underscores just how dominant Mahomes, Andy Reid, and Travis Kelce have been in the postseason.Kelce, in particular, has often been Allen’s nightmare, delivering clutch performances and touchdowns that crush Buffalo’s hopes again and again.Meanwhile, Hailee Steinfeld and Allen continue to be one of the NFL’s most-watched power couples, but even off-field love can’t soften the frustration of four straight playoff exits at the hands of the same team. If Allen loses to Mahomes again, the pressure will skyrocket — not just from media and fans, but perhaps even internally from the organization.Also Read: Josh Allen gives up oceanfront mansion after secret wedding—did Hailee Steinfeld want him out of L.A.?

Let’s be honest—no one expected Bill Belichick to go from Super Bowl mastermind to the center of social media drama. But in 2025, that’s exactly where he’s landed—and it's not because of a quarterback controversy or game-day call. It’s because of his 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, and one very cryptic Instagram Story set to Taylor Swift 's So Long, London.Jordon Hudson, whose social media persona is just as curated as her jet-setting lifestyle, took to Instagram on July 13 with a moody window shot mid-flight over Bar Harbor, Maine. The soundtrack? Swift’s most haunting bre“If Bill and I were to break up, would he co-write a song with Taylor Swift titled: ‘buh-bah baa ha ba’ ???”She passed it off as an “airplane thought,” but let’s not pretend this is just some harmless joke. When you pair your relationship with a Taylor Swift breakup track, you’re making a statement—even if it’s buried in humor. And fans noticed. Quickly.This isn’t the first time Jordon Hudson has raised eyebrows. From her awkward CBS interview where she dodged questions about her relationship, to her increasing public presence, it’s clear she’s no longer just “Bill’s girlfriend”—she’s a media figure in her own right.But that spotlight comes with criticism, especially given their 48-year age gap and her sudden rise into tabloid relevance.Even inside UNC’s football program, there’s reportedly tension. According to insiders, some staff are quietly annoyed by the nonstop attention Hudson brings. What was supposed to be Belichick’s quiet reinvention in college football has instead turned into a circus—and Paul Finebaum nailed it on First Take:“Bill Belichick. Anybody heard of this guy? He’s only the most famous NFL coach of all time this side of Vince Lombardi. But lately, he’s played second fiddle to his girlfriend.” Ouch!Whether Jordon’s post was sarcasm, a subtle cry for space, or a dramatic mid-air vibe check, it’s hard to ignore the noise around their relationship. And with Taylor Swift’s lyrics adding fuel to the gossip fire, it’s clear Belichick’s private life is now very public territory.So, can Coach B dial down the drama and focus on UNC’s playbook? Or is this just what the second act of a football legend looks like in the age of Instagram and Swifties?

Tom Brady and Sofia Vergara shared yacht time, but was it just a fleeting flirtation?

Does Sofia Vergara’s dream man checklist match Tom Brady?

In the world of high-profile celebrity crossovers, a single snapshot can ignite an avalanche of speculation. That’s exactly what happened when Tom Brady and Sofía Vergara were spotted enjoying the summer sun aboard a luxury superyacht in Rome. The two megastars — both freshly single — sparked dating rumors after allegedly getting cozy during a star-studded European getaway.While fans have been buzzing over whether the NFL icon and the “Modern Family” star are Hollywood’s newest couple, sources close to both camps insist there’s no serious romance. According to TMZ, insiders called the idea of them dating “ridiculous,” emphasizing that the buzz is little more than a “summer fling”—if anything.The duo were seen on the Ritz-Carlton’s opulent Luminara yacht alongside an A-list crowd that included Martha Stewart, Kendall Jenner, Naomi Campbell, and even Brady’s ex, Irina Shayk. Eyewitnesses told Page Six that Brady was making “googly eyes” at Vergara during dinner and “asked to switch seats to sit next to her.” A photo from the trip captured Maluma kissing Vergara on the forehead with Brady standing nearby — further fueling fan fantasies.Still, no official romance has been confirmed. Sources maintain both Brady and Vergara are single and mingling, but not committed. “It’s nothing more than a summer fling,” one source clarified, shutting down rumors of anything serious.Vergara, who finalized her divorce from Joe Manganiello, previously described her ideal partner as someone with “basic stuff, like health and somebody that loves me.” But she didn’t stop there, adding, “I want somebody that has as much money as me or more, because if not, it’s a nightmare. They end up resenting you.” Considering Brady’s $375 million deal with Fox Sports and his Hall of Fame football career, he checks that financial box with ease.Reports also place Brady vacationing in Ibiza with his daughter Vivian — whom he shares with ex-wife Gisele Bündchen — at the same time Vergara was in the area. Though there’s no confirmation they met, the overlap only adds intrigue. Brady is also dad to two more children from previous relationships, and insiders are staying tight-lipped on whether any introductions occurred.Also Read: Tom Brady can’t move on from Gisele Bündchen?

Steelers nearly caused QB chaos? Analyst says drafting Aaron Rodgers after Big Ben would've created a total quarterback mess,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/steelers-nearly-caused-qb-chaos-analyst-says-drafting-aaron-rodgers-after-big-ben-wouldve-created-a-total-quarterback-mess/articleshow/122447381.cms,"Steelers would’ve been a mess with Aaron Rodgers and Ben Roethlisberger together, claims analyst (Getty Images)

Steelers avoided a quarterback nightmare by not drafting Aaron Rodgers , analyst claims



Najee's firework accident, Mahomes not a fan of 18 games, NFLPA updates | PFT PM (FULL) | NFL on NBC

Few rookie quarterbacks have ever burst onto the NFL scene quite like Ben Roethlisberger did in 2004. Selected 11th overall by the Pittsburgh Steelers out of Miami (Ohio), “Big Ben” made an immediate impact by going 13-0 as a rookie starter and earning the Offensive Rookie of the Year title. The Steelers looked to have finally found their franchise quarterback after two decades of instability at the position post-Terry Bradshaw.However, Roethlisberger’s magic didn’t completely carry over into the postseason. He threw two interceptions in a shaky Divisional Round win against the New York Jets—a game the Steelers should’ve dominated—and added three more picks in a blowout AFC Championship loss to the Patriots. While fans remained hopeful, the front office wasn’t entirely sold just yet.That hesitation opened the door to one of the most intriguing “what ifs” in recent NFL history.According to NBC Sports’ Mike Florio, then-Steelers pro personnel coordinator Doug Whaley revealed that Pittsburgh seriously considered drafting Cal quarterback Aaron Rodgers in 2005. Rodgers, who had been projected as a possible No. 1 overall pick, was unexpectedly slipping in the first round.“[Whaley] made a comment recently that in 2005, as Aaron Rodgers… was plummeting through Round 1, the Steelers were considering taking him, if he had made it all the way down to No. 30,” Florio shared via Pro Football Talk. “Obviously, six spots earlier, the Packers took him at 24.”Had Rodgers slipped just a few more picks, Pittsburgh might have made the boldest quarterback move in NFL history—selecting back-to-back first-round QBs in consecutive years. Florio summed it up perfectly: “Man, that would have been awkward… That would have been something, Roethlisberger one year, Rodgers the next year. Who would have emerged as the long-term option? Presumably one of them gets traded. That would have been a mess. ”Ultimately, Rodgers went to Green Bay, and the Steelers chose tight end Heath Miller at No. 30. Far from a mere fallback, Miller carved out a legendary career in Pittsburgh, earning two Pro Bowl nods, two Super Bowl rings, and setting every major tight end record for the franchise.In hindsight, both teams struck gold. The Steelers won the Super Bowl that season—largely on the strength of their defense and running game—and added another in 2008, with Roethlisberger playing a leading role. Meanwhile, Rodgers waited three years behind Brett Favre before finally starting—and then defeating Roethlisberger in Super Bowl 45.Neither quarterback returned to the big stage again, but between them, three Lombardis and a legacy of consistent excellence prove both franchises made the right call on that fateful April day in 2005.Also Read: ""We get to talk once a week"": Jason Kelce hails Travis as a ‘great uncle’ and the ‘best friend’ he could ever ask for","Ben Roethlisberger went 13-0 as a rookie starter for the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2004.

After being AWOL for nearly two months, a death hoax regarding Eugenia Cooney is circling all around the internet. Cooney has always been a matter of concern to her fans regarding her underweight condition along with her alleged eating disorder, anorexia.But what has prompted the social media as it is buzzing right now about the death of this popular TikTok and YouTube celebrity? Is she really dead? Let’s find out the reality.Eugenia Sullivan Cooney is a prominent face in the world of fashion content creation. Starting way back her journey in the early 2010s, Cooney now boasts a substantial fan following across the major social media platforms - over 2 million on Youtube, almost a quarter less than a million on Instagram, and almost 300 million views on all of her content.Her work mainly revolves around fashion and beauty tutorials, along with emo/goth aesthetics with cosplay, vlogs and many more. But this creator has always been in the pages of controversy.Her recent death hoax has been stirred by a summary from Meta AI. This summary claimed that on July 15 2025, Cooney passed away at the age of 30. This dispute got even more heated up by another claim from one of Cooney’s alleged neighbors, named Trixie, who stated that she lived around the block from her and saw an ambulance and a body bag carrying a body.These two claims were the real reason the death hoax of Cooney is trending all around the internet.For some seconds, these claims might sound very real. Eugenia Cooney has always been a controversial person and the main reason behind that is her poor health condition. In 2015, fans signed a petition to ban this creator as according to them she put bad influence on his viewers regarding strong concerns over her extremely thin appearance, with critics accusing her of being “thinspiration” for eating disorders. However, one year later Cooney stated that she didn’t promote any eating disorder.Something similar happened in 2022 when she was banned from Twitch as well. After that, she became popular on TikTok, but she was eventually restricted there as well. And all of these because of her negative impression towards her viewers regarding poor health and life-style.She suffered from another death hoax when she took a break from social media in Feb 2019, citing health issues. Although she returned after a few months, but that didn’t happen in May 2025. This was the month when we saw Cooney in a livestream on any social media platform. But this livestream ended abruptly as she appeared to collapse and started gagging. She ended the livestream informing everyone that sheAfter that, a couple of videos have been shared by her social media accounts, but those two looked pre-recorded.

Poll Do you believe Jofra Archer is back to his best form? Yes, he's back! Not yet, but close No, he needs more time

England fast bowler Jofra Archer marked his return to test cricket after 4.5 years with a match-winning performance against India at Lord's on Monday, taking five wickets to help secure a 22-run victory and 2-1 series lead. The performance came exactly six years after Archer helped England win their first Cricket World Cup at the same venue.Archer made an immediate impact on the final day, removing Rishabh Pant 's off stump and taking a one-handed caught-and-bowled to dismiss Washington Sundar early in the morning session.Working with captain Ben Stokes , Archer helped reduce India from their overnight score of 58-4 to 82-7 in the first 40 minutes. India, chasing 193, was eventually bowled out for 170.""Yeah, part of the reason I went with Jof this morning ... six years ago now to the day,"" said Stokes. ""He played a major role, and I had a feeling he'd do something special and crack the game open.""Archer consistently troubled the Indian batsmen with speeds reaching 90 mph (145 kph), though Stokes managed his workload carefully with five-over spells spaced well apart.""I had a gut feeling that Jof's going to do something in his first game back,"" Stokes said.""Every time he's announced on the tannoy, the ground erupts, and when the speeds go up on the screen, the feeling changes.""The careful management of his bowling spells frustrated Archer, but he understood the precaution given his history of elbow and back injuries.""It was pretty hectic, for the first game back,"" Archer told Sky Sports. ""I probably bowled a few more overs than I thought I would've but every single one mattered today so I'm not too fussed about it. Only played one test at Lord's and that one was just as special as this one. It's been a long time coming, a lot of rehab, a lot of training. But moments like this make it worth it.""Archer remained confident about his return to test cricket despite his last test being in February 2021 in Ahmedabad and his previous home test in August 2020.""I'm not totally out of the woods yet but it's a good start,"" he said. ""The style of cricket that this team plays, it means I'm going to bowl a lot of overs!""The match was marked by verbal exchanges, particularly after Archer dismissed Pant and Sundar.""We came together as a group yesterday and said, you know, sometimes we're too nice. We go to other places and some teams are not as nice to us as we are to them so I guess we just tried to shift it. I don't know if it gave us a bit more of a buzz in the field or not but we will keep it in the bank for the future!""Regarding his exchange with Pant, Archer said: ""It wasn't a proud moment. I just told him to cherish that moment. He came down the track and that annoyed me a little bit so when the ball nipped down the slope, I was so grateful.""""Managing the workload is still very hard, being told you can bowl some days and not others,"" Archer added about his ongoing recovery process.",England fast bowler Jofra Archer returns to test cricket after 4.5 years.

After nearly five days of gripping and high-quality Test cricket, England edged out India by 22 runs in a thrilling finish to the third Test at Lord’s, taking a 2-1 lead in the five-match series.India began the final day needing 135 runs with six wickets in hand, chasing a target of 193. England struck early, removing four Indian batters before lunch. However, the final two wickets didn’t come easy, as India’s lower order, led by Ravindra Jadeja, put up a brave fight across the remaining two sessions before being bowled out for 170.Jadeja stood tall amid the collapse, finishing unbeaten on a gritty 61.Praising Jadeja's performance, India captain Shubman Gill called him the team’s most valuable player.""Ravindra Jadeja is India’s most valuable player — very hard to find. Batting with the tail was something we had spoken about, and the character he showed was tremendous. We felt 190 was gettable. One or two fifty-run partnerships would have taken the game deep and made things easier. We were alive in the game. The way Jaddu bhai and the lower order batted — a proud effort by them,"" Gill said after the match.Reflecting on the turning points, Gill admitted India lost the grip during crucial phases.""The last hour yesterday and the first hour today weren’t good with the bat. We needed one solid partnership at the top, but unfortunately, the top order didn’t perform — for the first time in the series,"" he said.Gill also lauded Ben Stokes’ relentless spell during India’s chase.""The kind of effort Ben Stokes put in — 11 overs on the trot — deserves admiration from both sides,"" he said.Providing an update on Rishabh Pant, who suffered a finger injury during England’s first innings, Gill confirmed that the wicketkeeper-batter should be available for the next Test in Manchester.""Pant went for scans, and he should be fine for the next Test. His run-out was the biggest moment in the game. We knew batting on Day 5 wouldn’t be easy,"" he said.Pant, who sustained a blow to his left index finger on Day 1, didn’t keep wickets for the rest of the innings and was replaced behind the stumps by Dhruv Jurel. He struggled while batting in the second innings and managed just 9 runs.Gill also clarified the confusion around Pant’s run-out in the first innings, where he was dismissed for 74 while attempting to rotate strike with KL Rahul, who was nearing a century.""It wasn’t about a personal milestone — it was an error in judgment. It was Pant’s call, and KL was at the danger end,"" Gill explained.Asked about his verbal exchange with England opener Zak Crawley on Day 3, Gill played down the moment, saying such things happen in intense contests.""When you're giving everything, there will be moments of heat. But there’s a lot of mutual admiration between the two teams. Such moments happen in the heat of battle,"" he said.","England beat India by 22 runs in the third Test at Lord's.

The Big Question: Will Bradley Beal Accept a Minimum Deal?

Theare reportedly exploring the possibility of pairing Stephen Curry with another scoring threat, as rumors swirl around the potential buyout of Phoenix Suns guard Bradley Beal. As the franchise looks to stay competitive with an aging core, the addition of a proven scorer like Beal could provide the offensive boost needed for another title push.Following a disappointing exit from the 2025 NBA Playoffs, the Warriors are recalibrating their roster to support their trio of veterans—Steph Curry, Draymond Green, and Jimmy Butler—who are all nearing the twilight of their careers. With Curry turning 38 this season and Green and Butler also past their primes, Golden State is in urgent need of consistent offensive reinforcement.Enter Bradley Beal , a three-time All-Star and former scoring leader who could become available on the open market pending a buyout agreement with the Phoenix Suns.Beal, who signed a massive $251 million contract with the Washington Wizards before being traded to the Suns, is now a hot name in buyout talks. According to a report by ClutchPoints insider Brett Siegel, multiple teams are monitoring the situation.“There are several teams, including the Milwaukee Bucks, Golden State Warriors , and Los Angeles Lakers, who have shown interest in Beal,” wrote Siegel. However, Siegel also clarified that Golden State’s interest, while genuine, may not be as aggressive as some reports suggest:“Golden State, like several other teams, would surely give Beal a minimum contract if he were willing to accept such a deal and wanted to join them.”“Could this happen, and will the Warriors swoop in to steal Beal from the Clippers? Sure, anything is possible. However, it is unlikely that Beal will take a minimum contract.” (H/t: Sporting News)At 32 years old, Bradley Beal may no longer be in his prime, but his offensive skill set remains valuable—especially in a reduced role. Last season with the Suns, Beal played in 53 games and averaged:These numbers suggest that Beal still has enough in the tank to contribute meaningfully to a contender—particularly one like Golden State that can afford to use him more sparingly.For the Golden State Warriors, landing Beal at a bargain could be a win-win. He would relieve Curry of some scoring responsibilities, open up the floor with his shooting, and provide another veteran presence in the locker room. While Golden State isn’t alone in its interest, their status as a title-contending team could be an enticing destination for Beal—if he’s willing to sacrifice salary for another shot at postseason glory.Potential Benefits of Adding Beal:- Secondary scoring option behind Curry- Depth in the backcourt rotation- Improved three-point shooting- Veteran leadership with playoff experienceThe Golden State Warriors’ hands may be tied financially, which makes a league-minimum deal the only viable option. Whether Beal agrees to such terms will ultimately determine if the hypothetical pairing becomes a reality.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Miami Heat Expected to Hit Pause on Andrew Wiggins Talks Ahead of 2025-26 Season; Los Angeles Lakers Out?

How Nikola Jokić is Shaping the Future

In the rich history of basketball, few voices hold as much influence as’s. A Hall of Famer famously known as “The Logo,” West’s legacy is etched not just in NBA lore but in the very silhouette of the league itself. When he speaks, especially on talent evaluation, the basketball community listens. And when it comes to Nikola Jokić, West’s praise is not just enthusiastic—it’s transformative.During an appearance on Dave Wohl’s Front Office podcast, West offered perhaps the highest compliment possible for Nikola Jokić , likening his basketball mind to that of Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, LeBron James , and Chris Paul. “He thinks like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Chris Paul, LeBron James and he’s seven feet tall,” West noted. Such a comparison is no small feat—it places the Denver Nuggets star among the cerebral giants of the sport.What separates Jokić from other big men is his ability to see the court with unparalleled clarity. His mind operates on a different level, identifying passing angles and opportunities in ways reminiscent of elite playmakers—only he’s doing it from the center position.For West, Jokić’s physical gifts are as impressive as his mental sharpness.One of his standout traits? His extraordinary hands. West emphasized how Jokić has what he believes to be “the greatest pair of hands” in the game. Whether it’s securing a rebound in the middle of chaos or threading a no-look pass from the post, Jokić’s hand control makes the extraordinary seem routine.Describing Jokić’s rebounding instincts, West said, “He can be right in the middle of eight hands and somehow that ball comes out in his hands.” It’s a blend of finesse, anticipation, and touch that allows him to dominate without ever needing to out-jump or out-muscle opponents.Jokić is doing more than just excelling—he’s reshaping the traditional definition of a center. Former NBA guard BJ Armstrong echoed this sentiment, calling Jokić a “point-five”—a rare hybrid of point guard and center. “He is the first five-man you can actually run your offense through,” Armstrong said, emphasizing how Jokić’s court vision changes the offensive landscape.His passing game is a revelation. From initiating fast breaks to orchestrating half-court sets, Jokić doesn’t just participate in the offense—he runs it. Armstrong marveled at how Jokić can rebound, dribble coast-to-coast, and make perfect reads in transition, something practically unheard of from players at his position.Perhaps the most compelling aspect of Jokić’s game is how effortlessly he seems to operate. West described watching Jokić as akin to watching someone “playing in a hammock”—relaxed, composed, and always in control. It’s not that Jokić overwhelms with speed or strength. Rather, he charms the audience with his feel for the game.BJ Armstrong aptly captured this quality by saying, “He doesn’t move fast, he doesn’t jump high, he’s not quick, but he is charming.” That charm translates into numbers—stat lines that often include double-digit rebounds and assists, with scoring sprinkled in effortlessly.Jokić’s greatness was cemented during the 2023 NBA Playoffs, where he led the Denver Nuggets to their first-ever championship. His dominance in the Finals, capped by a Finals MVP award, silenced any remaining skepticism. For West, the title wasn’t just a win—it was a validation of Jokić’s unorthodox brilliance.That playoff run reinforced the idea that basketball IQ and skill can win just as effectively as speed and athleticism. Jokić proved that understanding the game on a deeper level is often more impactful than flashy plays or highlight reels.West’s admiration for Nikola Jokić also hints at where basketball might be headed. Much like Stephen Curry changed how the game is played by extending shooting range, Jokić is ushering in a new era for centers—one where intelligence, vision, and versatility are prioritized over pure athleticism.As teams look to develop future stars, Jokić’s model may become the standard. Big men will no longer be judged solely on how high they jump or how well they defend the rim but on how well they can think the game, pass, and lead from any position on the floor.Also read: Cleveland Cavaliers Re-Sign Randy Mims, Reinforcing Ties to LeBron James and a Legacy of Loyalty Nikola Jokić has quietly sparked a revolution—not with brashness or bold proclamations, but with a calm dominance that’s changing how we view the modern NBA.

Before turning 25, famous NBA player Jayson Tatum recently accomplished incredible feats that very few people in NBA history have ever achieved. He has been named in a new list of the Top 100 NBA Players of All Time. The list, shared by a major sports outlet, Bleacher Report, includes many of the NBA’s biggest legends. One can find Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on the list. Now, the player from the Boston Celtics got the honor.Due to its excess subjectivity, the ""Top 100 NBA Players of All Time"" list is often criticized. One of the primary reasons for the criticism is the way they compare players from different generations. Recency bias is another issue, in which more recent athletes are assigned a higher rank simply because they remain fresh in everyone's memory.Older players who were relevant during their time can get ignored or even forgotten, since they lack modern media coverage or video evidence. Recently, Boston Celtics ’ Jayson Tatum’s name appeared on the list. Bleacher Report surprisingly ranked the NBA player at number 93. In an attempt to explain this action, the outlet’s employees stated on Monday:“Jayson Tatum’s inclusion may be seen as a rush to coronation.He isn’t even halfway through his career. Then again, that’s kind of the point. He has been a positive-impact player on both sides of the ball since entering the league, mostly for a title contender, and already was the best player on a championship team. That is all before turning 28.”They also talked about his history of being selected to the first team of the NBA. They further opened up about how prestigious his group is, given how young he is.When healthy, Jayson Tatum is among the league's top players. He has participated in at least 70 games in six of the league's eight seasons and at least 64 in all eight. However, this new accomplishment has placed him in a spot.Nevertheless, in the end, because everyone has different ideas on who should be ranked where, lists like these are always controversial. Regardless of people’s opinion on the NBA star’s ranking, one thing is certain: Jayson Tatum has already established a significant reputation for himself and is only beginning.Also read: “Pls get a whole sleeve-” Dennis Schroder and other NBA Players react to Jayson Tatum’s new tattoo reveal","Jayson Tatum has been named in a new list of the Top 100 NBA Players of All Time.

"Toronto Maple Leafs may use cap space to reshape roster, Calle Jarnkrok a trade option",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/toronto-maple-leafs-may-use-cap-space-to-reshape-roster-calle-jarnkrok-a-trade-option/articleshow/122462267.cms,"Christopher Katsarov/The Canadian Press

Calle Jarnkrok’s future uncertain as Toronto Maple Leafs explore roster adjustments

Increased roster competition and Nick Robertson’s expected role add pressure on lineup decisions

With more than $5 million in available cap space and only Nick Robertson left to sign, the Toronto Maple Leafs are in a flexible position this offseason. While the team is unlikely to spend all of it immediately, trade discussions and roster tweaks remain possible. One name emerging in speculation is Calle Jarnkrok, whose recent injury struggles and cap hit could make him a candidate for a move.Calle Jarnkrok had a solid debut season with the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2022–23, scoring 20 goals and 39 points in 73 games. However, the past two seasons have been plagued by injuries, limiting him to just 71 games combined, in which he scored 11 goals and 28 points. According to David Pagnotta of The Fourth Period, Toronto has had discussions with Jarnkrok, and while there is no formal trade request, the forward may not be opposed to one under the current circumstances.Jarnkrok carries a $2.1 million AAV cap hit for one more year and has a 10-team no-trade list. Though his contract isn’t overly difficult to move, several rebuilding teams that typically absorb contracts to hit the cap floor have already made their moves this summer. If the Maple Leafs want to clear space or create opportunity for younger talent, Jarnkrok could be a logical piece to move.One of the pressing reasons behind the speculation is Nick Robertson.The young winger is due for a new contract and is expected to need a near full-time role with the Toronto Maple Leafs next season. With healthy players like Calle Jarnkrok, David Kampf, and Steven Lorentz also vying for everyday spots, a roster crunch is inevitable. The team may need to part with someone to make room, especially if they want to remain flexible during the regular season.Trading Jarnkrok would not only help balance the roster but also give Toronto some cushion to pursue mid-season upgrades or handle unexpected injuries.The Toronto Maple Leafs aren’t in a rush to spend their remaining cap space, but they may still consider reshaping their lineup. With Calle Jarnkrok’s declining availability and growing roster competition, he stands out as a potential trade chip. As the offseason continues, Toronto's front office could look to make a quiet but strategic move.Also Read: Kris Letang’s intense offseason training impresses NHL fans",The Toronto Maple Leafs have more than $5 million in available cap space.

Can Paul McFarland deliver the power-play breakthrough the Edmonton Oilers need to chase the Stanley Cup ?

What Paul McFarland’s NHL power-play plan means for the Edmonton Oilers’ Stanley Cup dreams

The Edmonton Oilers aren’t standing pat this offseason. Looking to get more out of an already loaded offense, they’ve brought in Paul McFarland as an assistant coach to take over the power play and offensive schemes. It’s a familiar move in the NHL—find a specialist to maximize star power. For Edmonton, it’s about giving Connor McDavid Leon Draisaitl , and the rest of the core the right structure to break through when it matters. Alongside McFarland, the Oilers have also added Peter Aubry as goalie coach and Conor Allen to work on skills development, signaling a broader commitment to fine-tuning the details.Paul McFarland’s career has taken a winding path through the hockey world, giving him mix of junior development experience and NHL bench time. He first got his NHL break with the Florida Panthers , working two seasons under head coach Bob Boughner. That staff also included Jack Capuano and Ben Cooper, offering McFarland a chance to carve out his role running offensive systems at the highest level.But he was no stranger to coaching before that. McFarland had already led the Kingston Frontenacs in the OHL and worked with Team Canada at the U-17 level and the Ivan Hlinka Memorial, getting an up-close look at the next wave of talent. It was the kind of background that helped him build a reputation for teaching and development.After Florida, McFarland joined the Toronto Maple Leafs for a season as an assistant coach. That’s where he first worked alongside Dave Hakstol. Their connection would come full circle when Hakstol got the nod to be the inaugural head coach of the Seattle Kraken and brought McFarland with him. Coaching an expansion team is never easy, but it was another NHL chapter for a coach who has never shied away from new challenges.When he left Seattle, McFarland went back to junior hockey, taking the head coaching role with the Calgary Hitmen in the WHL. Even though it was a short stint, it kept him connected to teaching the game at its developmental core—a trait that Oilers management clearly values.Now in Edmonton, McFarland will be tasked with getting the most out of a power play unit that already features McDavid, Draisaitl, Zach Hyman, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, and Evan Bouchard. It’s not about reinventing the wheel so much as fine-tuning the machine to run when it matters most.By adding Paul McFarland, the Oilers are betting that a fresh voice with a deep background in offense can help unlock even more from one of the NHL’s most talented rosters. The hires of Peter Aubry and Conor Allen show the team’s serious about building a complete staff, not just for the stars but for every detail. It’s another step in Edmonton’s pursuit of the Cup—and it’ll be worth watching how this new coaching mix shapes the season ahead.Also Read: Nathan MacKinnon stuns Cole Harbour hockey camp with surprise visit, igniting big-league dreams","Paul McFarland has joined the Edmonton Oilers as an assistant coach.

Philadelphia Flyers and Porter Martone have important decision on 2025-26 development trajectory



7/6 Development Camp: Porter Martone

Philadelphia Flyers prospect Porter Martone is already making legitimate NHL noise before even inking his initial pro contract. The 2025 first-round pick is regarded as the most NHL-ready forward from this year's draft class and recently earned top-level experience by suiting up for Team Canada at the 2025 IIHF World Championship. Now, the Philadelphia Flyers and Porter Martone must figure out the ideal route forward—how to balance long-term growth with a potential NHL debut this fall.Only 18 years old, Porter Martone has opportunities that others can only imagine. The 6-foot-3, 208-pound right-shot winger ran roughshod over the Ontario Hockey League with 98 points in 57 games a season ago for the Brampton Steelheads. With size, ability, and prototype instincts, it's not a question of whether Porter Martone will make it to the NHL—it's when.""For me, my mindset is to make the NHL next year. If management feels otherwise, that’s when I’ll talk to my agent. I want to play a full NHL season next year. When you come into camp, you have to earn it,"" Porter Martone said during the Flyers' recent development camp. That confidence is mutually held by the Flyers' brass.General manager Daniel Briere and assistant GM Brent Flahr both have no issue with the notion of Martone reaching the NHL roster through training camp, but they're equally concerned with doing what's best for his long-term development.“He wants to play in the NHL, and that’s a discussion we’ll have with his agent. As much as we want him to play, we have to make sure we do what’s best for him. We’ll figure that out in the coming weeks and see what he wants to do, and go from there,” Flahr said.Martone is presently unsigned, leaving open the possibility of several developmental paths. Accepting a one-year entry-level contract (ELC) with the Flyers would offer an immediate signing bonus and enable Martone to attend both Rookie Camp and full NHL training camp. He could play up to nine regular-season games without using up a year of his ELC.Also read: Porter Martone builds solid case for NHL debut as Philadelphia Flyers consider next step Regardless of which path Porter Martone and the Philadelphia Flyers take, the ultimate goal stays the same: getting Martone ready to excel as an NHL power forward.

Taylor Swift’s friendship with Blake Lively crumbles as the actress’ legal drama with Justin Baldoni takes a turn



Will Blake Lively and Taylor Swift go back to the way they were?



Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are enjoying a pretty private life, away from all the noise even though the pop star’s name is attached to the legal mess between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni. At this point, there seems to be a huge turn in Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni’s legal drama, even though both Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce continue to be silent on it.Apparently, Taylor Swift’s former best friend, Blake Lively’s legal team had put in a request for the deposition to be held at their office instead of Justin Baldoni’s legal team’s office, in New York City on Thursday.However, as per TMZ, Justin Baldoni’s legal team was quick to act on this and filed a response to Blake Lively’s request and rejected it. Apparently, both the offices are pretty near to each other so Blake Lively’s “fear” of the paparazzi has not been entertained.As per TMZ, Justin Baldoni’s legal team has issued a statement on this. The statement read as, “Although Lively’s foot-stomping and use of her celebrity status may have enabled her to seize control of the film, which is the crux of this dispute, her counsel’s tantrum has no place in this Court.”Blake Lively’s legal team has slammed such speculations and have also issued a statement. As per People, a statement issued by Blake Lively’s rep reads as, “Ms. Lively is looking forward to her deposition next week, and it should follow the same rules as every other witness in this case.”But recently, the case took a turn when Judge Lewis Liman granted the request put in by Blake Lively’s legal team.Amid all the mess, it seems Blake Lively’s friendship with Taylor Swift has taken a huge hit, as per Page Six.It seems highly unlikely that Taylor Swift and Blake Lively will go back to the way they had been for close to a decade.While the Blake Lively-Justin Baldoni’s legal drama goes through a series of twists and turns, both Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have maintained their distance from it.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour moment has resurfaced and fans believe it foretold her love with Travis Kelce","Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are enjoying a pretty private life, away from all the noise.

The West Indies narrowly avoided the all-time lowest Test score of 26, set by New Zealand in 1955.After the match, Starc, who won both player of the match and series awards, shared his thoughts: ""We didn't think things would start going our way with the ball today until the sun went down a bit. But anyway our bowling attack has been pretty much on the money throughout the series.""The West Indies' batting struggles were highlighted by their captain Royston Chase, who admitted: ""Assessing this series is simple: the bowlers kept us in the contest and the batting let us down time after time. We need to put in some serious work on our batting moving forward if we really want to compete.""The teams will now shift their focus to T20Is, with the first of five matches scheduled for Monday.West Indies posted only 27 runs on the board - the second-lowest total in five-day Test cricket history.

Poll What do you think was the key factor in India's loss at Lord's? Rishabh Pant's run out Loss of early wickets Bowling performance of England Lack of aggressive batting strategy

India fell in the 3rd Test of the five-match series against England at Lord's on Monday. After a hard-fought battle over the last five days, the visitors ended up falling 22 runs short of the target set by Ben Stokes ' side. While the game had several excitng moments, from Jofra Archer's exciting return, to several verbal spats and heated moments between players, it was a sublime display by the England bowlers that ended India's hopes of taking a 2-1 lead in the series.After starting the first session on Sunday at 58/4, India needed 135 runs to win with six wickets in hand. However, the loss of crucial wickets such as that of KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant left Ravindra Jadeja the responsibility of getting India over the finish line. While the all-rounder ultimately fell short of the target, he was lauded for his marathon effort with Jasprit Bumrah and then Mohammed Siraj towards the end. His impressive 61* off 181 balls gave India hope after a turbulent and disastrous Day 5.After the game, England legend and former skipper Alastair Cook analysed India's defeat, and singled out one paricular reason why Gautam Gambhir 's men lost the 3rd Test. While the obvious reasons point to Rishabh Pant's unfortunate run out on Day 3, Cook singled out another flaw from India. ""They played it in their way. It almost worked. I've never seen a side go that way, you know? We're gonna take one (run) an over.If we take 60 overs, we'll get there in 60 overs,"" said Cook, speaking for BBC Sport.Jadeja's incredible resilience drew praise from the former Test captain. The 36-year-old, who is ranked as the best all-rounder in the world in the red-ball format, battled at the crease for 181 balls. ""Incredible mental fortitude by Jadeja to do it. I think they'll look back and think they should have been more proactive, but its not that bit, its the batting at the top, 40-1 and cruising, to suddenly lose those four wickets there has hurt them,"" said Cook.India will play the 4th Test at Old Trafford Cricket Ground in 8 days, where they will need to pull off a crucial win if they are to stay alive in the series.",England beat India by 22 runs in the 3rd Test at Lord's on Monday.

Green had an altercation with La Primera before her match backstage, which ultimately led to Bella gaining an ally of her own.Moreover, the WWE Universe in attendance for RAW was thrilled to see Bella in action in a singles bout after a long time. Moreover, she has already revealed that her current run is going to last for a while.

Who was Fauja Singh?

Fauja Singh died in a hit-and-run case in Punjab.

Legendary marathon runner Fauja Singh dies at 114 in road accident. (ANI)

Fauja Singh, the world's oldest marathon runner and British Sikh athlete of Indian origin, passed away at age 114 after being struck by a car in his native village in Punjab on July 14. He was struck by a speeding vehicle as he took a walk outside his home in Beas village. While walking on the berm of Jalandhar-Pathankot highway, he was hit by the unidentified vehicle at around 3.30pm, his son Harbinder Singh said. The family took him to a nearby hospital, but he died around 8pm.Known as the ""Turbaned Tornado,"" Singh began his running career at age 89 to cope with grief and went on to set numerous age-group world records, including becoming the first centenarian to complete a marathon.Born on April 1, 1911, in Beas Pind, Jalandhar, Punjab, Singh overcame early physical challenges, being unable to walk until age five due to weak legs. He worked as a farmer in Punjab before moving to East London in 1992 following his wife's death.Singh's remarkable running journey began in 1994 after the death of his fifth son, Kuldip. He initially took up jogging to manage his grief, but it wasn't until 2000, at age 89, that he seriously pursued running, completing the London Marathon in 6 hours and 54 minutes.In 2011, at age 100, Singh achieved an extraordinary feat by breaking eight world age-group records in a single day at the Ontario Masters Association Fauja Singh Invitational Meet in Toronto. His records included completing 100m in 23.14 seconds, 200m in 52.23 seconds, and 400m in 2:13.48.Three days after setting these records, Singh became the first centenarian to complete a marathon, finishing the Toronto Waterfront Marathon in 8 hours, 11 minutes, and 6 seconds. Despite this achievement, Guinness World Records did not recognise the feat due to the absence of a birth certificate, as official records were not maintained in India in 1911.Throughout his running career, Singh participated in numerous marathons worldwide, including events in London, New York, Toronto, and Mumbai. His personal best came at the 2003 Toronto Waterfront Marathon, which he completed in five hours and 40 minutes in the 'over 90' category.Singh's achievements extended beyond running records. He became the first non-American to receive the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 2003 for promoting racial tolerance. He was awarded the Pride of India title in 2011 and appeared in advertising campaigns alongside David Beckham and Muhammad Ali.A biography titled ""Turbaned Tornado,"" written by Chandigarh-based columnist Khushwant Singh, was published on July 7, 2011. In 2021, a biopic titled ""Fauja,"" directed by Omung Kumar B, was announced.Singh retired from competitive running at age 101 after completing his final race, a 10km run in Hong Kong, in 1 hour 32 minutes and 28 seconds. He served as a torchbearer for the 2012 London Olympics and received recognition from Queen Elizabeth II, who personally congratulated him on his 100th birthday.Throughout his running career, Singh was supported by his personal trainer Harminder Singh and used his platform to raise funds for various charities while promoting Sikh culture globally. A vegetarian, he was also the oldest person to feature in a PETA campaign.","Fauja Singh, the world's oldest marathon runner, died on July 14.

Scorpions are back. And this time, it’s more than just another stop on a world tour. The legendary German rock band is heading to Etihad Arena in Abu Dhabi on October 21, bringing their Coming Home tour to the UAE capital for the first time in years. It’s a rare appearance and it marks six decades since the band formed. That kind of longevity is almost unheard of in rock.They’ll hit the stage with a setlist built from some of the most recognizable songs in rock history. Whether you’re a lifelong fan or just curious about what a six-decade career sounds like live, this is a show that promises real energy and a connection that goes beyond just the hits.Scorpions started out in Hanover, Germany in 1965. That’s before Led Zeppelin released a single track. They’ve been at it ever since, writing, recording, touring, and adapting. Few bands from their era are still active, and even fewer are still selling out arenas.They’re best known for a handful of rock staples:But if you stop at the hits, you miss the bigger story. Scorpions have released over 20 studio albums. They’ve sold more than 100 million records worldwide. And they’ve performed in over 100 countries, including places that rarely host international rock shows.This isn’t a reunion or comeback tour. Scorpions never really left.Scorpions haven’t played Abu Dhabi in a long time. Their last UAE concert was in Dubai in 2017, part of a limited Middle East run. Before that, you’d have to go back even further to catch them in the region.This 2025 show at Etihad Arena marks their return to the UAE capital and it’s a one-night stop.

Poll Do you think England can maintain their lead in the series? Yes, they have the momentum No, India will bounce back

England, coming into the 3rd Test at Lord's after a defeat to the visitors at Edgbaston, turned around the odds in style as they won the match by 22 runs. While both sides were bowled out for 387 in their first innings, England found themselves in trouble after the Indian bowling attack worked brilliantly to end their second innings at 192.With the odds falling in India's favour, England needed to respond adequately on the final day. With the visitors reduced to 58/4 by stumps on Day 4, it was Jofra Archer that made headlines once again as play resumed on Day 5. It was the 30-year-old that claimed the crucial wickets of Rishabh Pant and Washington Sundar on Monday, that too, in his first spell of the day, handing England the upper hand.Reacting to Archer's return and why the captain put all his trust on the pacer who was back from a long spell of injuries, skipper Ben Stokes revelaed his motivation behind the same. ""There was a bit of discussion in the dressing room around letting him (Brydon Carse) keep going, but in my gut, because of the day six years ago—we won that World Cup, Jofra played a massive moment in that—I just thought it was set up for him to do something that Jofra does,"" Stokes told BBC Sport.Carse, who shocked Indian batters at the end of Day 4 with the crucial wickets of Karun Nair and Shubman Gill paved the way in subduing India's charge to the 193 target set by England.""That Rishabh Pant wicket was awesome. The caught-and-bowled, obviously—those two wickets in that first spell he bowled really blew the game open for us. Sometimes the gut works,"" said the skipper with a subtle laugh, reacting to his decision that ultimately paved the way for a thrilling England win.With the series tipping 2-1 in England's favour, the 4th Test at Old Trafford Cricket Ground starting July 23 becomes a must-win affair for Shubman Gill and his men. The 5th and final Test will be played at The Oval in London.",England beat India by 22 runs in the 3rd Test at Lord's. Jofra Archer took crucial wickets of Rishabh Pant and Washington Sundar. The 30-year-old was back from a long spell of injuries. The series is now 2-1 in England's favour.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122483988,imgsize-153840,width-400,resizemode-4/122483988.jpg"
