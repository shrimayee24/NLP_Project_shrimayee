The Truth Behind Curtailed Vande Mataram : Politics, Unity And A Century Of Cultural Tension

Modi: Nehru compromised instead of taking on Jinnah

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi Monday accused Congress of betraying ‘ Vande Mataram ’ and bowing to pressure from Mohammed Ali Jinnah to “divide” it despite Mahatma Gandhi’s praise that the patriotic song had become like a national anthem , saying the party meted out the “grave injustice” due to its appeasement politics.Initiating a discussion in Lok Sabha on the national song’s 150th anniversary, Modi traced its evolution to becoming a rallying cry for patriots and unifying spirit against the British rule, including in the popular agitation against Bengal’s division in 1905.He said Gandhi, who then practised law in South Africa, had recognised its immense appeal in Bengal. Quoting Gandhi’s statements on the song in a weekly, Indian Opinion, in 1905, Modi said: “it is so popular that (it is almost) as if it has become our national anthem. Its sentiments are great, and it is sweeter than anthems of other nations. Its sole motive is to ignite the patriotic spirit in us. It sees India as mother and worships her”.If it was such a great song, then why was it betrayed in the last century?” asked PM Narendra Modi before taking aim at first PM Jawaharlal Nehru. “Which were the forces whose wishes prevailed on the sentiments of revered Bapu? A sacred song like ‘Vande Mataram’ was dragged into controversy,” he said, in reference to Congress’s decision in 1937 to confine its recital to the first two paras.The current generation must know the reasons behind the betrayal of a song which had frightened the British so much that they banned it and repressed those who chanted it as a nationalist slogan. He also took a swipe at Trinamool Congress, saying parties having Congress in their name keep raising controversy around the song, which often draws criticism from a section of Muslims for its vivid Hindu themes, including invocation of deities. Modi appeared to be responding to critics, who have found the song’s imagery of nation as agoddess objectionable, with a strong articulation of cultural nationalism, a foundational guide to the Sangh Parivar, as he noted that even the Vedas have visualised India as a mother.Modi’s over 55-minute speech was heard without any serious disruption, and he made a concession to TMC MP Saugata Roy when the latter rose to object to his use of ‘da’ and not the more respectful ‘babu’ after the songwriter Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s first name, thanking him for the suggestion. Modi used the suffix “babu” for Bankim from that point onwards.With the song’s association with Bengali icons like Bankim Chandra Chatterjee and Rabindra Nath Tagore, who set it to music, BJP hopes to deepen its connect with the people of West Bengal, which goes to the polls in a few months, as it takes on CM Mamata Banerjee-headed Trinamool which has often championed its regional identity to corner its main rival.Modi said when Jinnah protested on Oct 15, 1937, against the song, which was sung in Congress sessions, Nehru, as the president of his party, felt insecure and “agreed” with the Muslim League leader’s criticism by writing to Subhas Chandra Bose that its Anandmath background may irritate and provoke Muslims. Nehru compromised instead of taking on Jinnah and the Congress, at its Kolkata session on Oct 26 pruned the song to its first two paras, he said, hammering home the irony of that conclave being organised in Chatterjee’s state.He added, “History is witness that Congress bowed down to Muslim League. Due to its appeasement politics, Congress bent to divide Vande Mataram, and that is why it had to bow down to the division of India later.”With the national song a fixture at BJP events, Modi said his party owed a debt to Vande Mataram that it needed to repay by ensuring it got its due.",PM Narendra Modi accused Congress of betraying ‘ Vande Mataram ’ and bowing to pressure from Mohammed Ali Jinnah to “divide” it.

Gautam Gambhir Press Conference: Team India head coach heaves fire after 2-1 ODI series win over SA

NEW DELHI: India head coach Gautam Gambhir is under increasing scrutiny after consecutive home Test series defeats, despite enjoying early success with India’s Champions Trophy and Asia Cup wins since taking charge in July last year. The team’s struggles in red-ball cricket — including a 3-0 loss to New Zealand followed by a 2-0 defeat against South Africa — have raised alarms, especially as India have been whitewashed in a home Test series only three times in history, with two of those coming during Gambhir’s stint.However, former India head coach Ravi Shastri believes criticism should not be directed at just one individual. Speaking on Prabhat Khabar’s YouTube podcast, he urged a broader view of accountability.""So when results come, one thing the public should remember is that players should also take responsibility. It should not be that you target one individual. It has happened to me, that is why I am speaking from experience. So it is important that the players also take the rap on the knuckles when something like this happens. There should be pride. They should feel hurt that we have lost. Until that happens, things will not move forward,"" he said.""Har match jitna hai. Nahi jitega to bandook tumhari taraf. Agar ye mere saath hota to mai pehle responsibility leta. Wo pride hona chaiye. Hurt hona chaiye ki hum haare hain. Pressure sabko aata hai. Jhelna padta hai. Cricket is 90 percent here in the mind [We have to win every match. If we don’t win, the gun will point at you. If this had happened with me, I would have taken responsibility first. There should be pride. You should feel hurt that we have lost. Everyone feels pressure. You have to deal with it. Cricket is 90 percent here — in the mind],"" Shastri said.Shastri also highlighted the importance of leadership qualities beyond tactics.""If your performance is poor, you could be fired. Therefore, you need to maintain patience. Communication and man-management skills are crucial here. Only then can you motivate the players to win. And that's what we did. The most important thing is to enjoy whatever you do. Don't take it as pressure,"" he explained.Drawing from his time overseeing India’s dominant Test period between 2014 and 2021, Shastri stressed that defeats should be viewed collectively.Watch the video here ""Everyone, right from the team management to the players, you can't single out one person. It's a collective decision. South Africa defeated India; no single player defeated India. South Africa played well as a team. Where did we play?"" he questioned.While he avoided directly criticising Gambhir, Shastri reiterated shared accountability for the recent slump.India’s first-ever home Test whitewash took place in 1999–2000, also against South Africa — a reminder of how rare such setbacks have been.",India head coach Gautam Gambhir is under increasing scrutiny after consecutive home Test series defeats.

Vande Mataram

NEW DELHI: Congress party countered Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""appeasement"" charges against first Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru during the Vande Mataram debate in Lok Sabha on Monday.Terming PM Modi ""the Master Distorian"", Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh posed three questions.Speaking in the Lok Sabha after PM Modi's remarks, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi accused PM Modi of blaming Nehru several times. ""Operation Sindoor - Pandit Nehru Ji's name 14 times and Congress's name 50 times. 75th Anniversary of the Constitution - Pandit Nehru Ji's name 10 times and Congress's name 26 times. 2022 President's Address - Pandit Nehru Ji's name 15 times. 2020 President's Address - Pandit Nehru Ji's name 20 time.

Despite giving a strong and befitting reply to the Muslim League's baseless statements, Nehru started investigating Vande Mataram. Five days after this, Nehru wrote a letter to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose mentioning that he agrees with the feeling of Mohammad Ali Jinnah and wrote, 'Vande Mataram's background in the Anand Matth can irritate Muslims',"" he said.""After this, Congress stated that, from 26 October onwards, in Bengal, the use of Vande Mataram will be analysed... Unfortunately, on 26 October, Congress compromised on Vande Mataram. They bifurcated the song. The reason behind the decision was of social harmony, but history has it that Congress had knelt before the muslim league. This was their way to appease minorities... Later, Congress had to kneel and agree to the partition of India. .. Congress policies are still the same, and along the way, the Indian National Congress has become the Muslim League Congress (MLC). Even today, Congress and its allied parties oppose Vande Mataram and try to create controversy around it,"" he added.The Lok Sabha began a special discussion marking 150 years of, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi opening the debate and Rajnath Singh set to conclude it.

The Battle Pakistan Lost To India Days Before 1971 War | I Witness

NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Thursday marked the historic air operations carried out on December 5, the third day of the 1971 war, underscoring how air power proved decisive in shaping the conflict’s outcome and paving the way for India’s victory and the creation of Bangladesh.In a post on X, the IAF recalled its strike on the Sakesar radar station, which crippled Pakistan’s key western air defences for two days.“On the third day of the 1971 war, the IAF was everywhere the enemy looked — and many places where they didn’t expect. Hunters tore through Drigh Road and Karachi, smashing storage hangars. Canberras kept up relentless pressure, delivering 1,44,000 lbs of ordnance across four major airfields,” the post said.The IAF added that 132 missions were flown on the western front, with An-12s and Canberras “raining devastation on enemy concentrations.” On the eastern front, with the Pakistan Air Force effectively grounded, 104 offensive sorties by the IAF cleared the way for the Indian Army’s rapid march into East Pakistan, ultimately leading to the birth of Bangladesh.It also recalled the legendary Battle of Longewala, fought from December 4 to 7, 1971, in Rajasthan’s Longewala sector, where heavily outnumbered Indian troops held their ground against a major Pakistani assault — a defence in which the IAF also played a crucial role.“Four Hunters rewrote history — shattering an enemy armoured thrust and leaving 27 tanks destroyed and 10 more damaged. Jaisalmer stood safe because air power arrived when it mattered,” the post highlighted.The 1971 India–Pakistan war began on December 3 with Pakistan launching pre-emptive strikes on Indian air bases amid the Bangladesh Liberation War in East Pakistan. The conflict ended on December 16 with Pakistan’s defeat, the surrender of 93,000 troops — the largest military capitulation since World War II — and the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent nation.","The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Thursday marked the historic air operations carried out on December 5, the third day of the 1971 war.

Viral clip of Shedeur Sanders becomes the main story as fans and people debate the “thong” moment

Equipment experts confirm Shedeur Sanders was wearing a standard NFL jockstrap during the Titans game

Shedeur Sanders delivers a four touchdown performance while the Browns lose and the discourse derails completely

Shedeur Sanders became the center of the NFL’s strangest viral moment on Monday Night Football after a broadcast replay caught the Cleveland Browns rookie in an unplanned wardrobe slip. The clip spread across social platforms within minutes and sparked a full internet spiral about what he was wearing under his uniform.Shedeur Sanders threw four total touchdowns in the 31-29 loss to the Tennessee Titans, but the conversation moved away from his production and focused on a two second shot that fans turned into a meme factory. Social media pushed one question louder than anything that happened in the game itself, and the fallout has fully overshadowed his stat line.The moment happened in the fourth quarter when Tennessee Titans defensive tackle T’Vondre Sweat dragged Shedeur Sanders down near the goal line. His uniform pants shifted as he hit the turf. The back strap of his underwear appeared on the broadcast camera. The exposure lasted less than two seconds, but the replay angle captured it clearly enough for the internet to screen grab, zoom, repost, and stitch it across every platform available.Within minutes, clips on X, TikTok, and Reddit labeled the angle as evidence that he was wearing a thong. One viral reaction read, “BRO, was Shedeur Sanders wearing a thong?” Another user added, “Please tell me we don’t have Watson 2.0 lol.” A third post joked, “The thing gonna thong,” which quickly became the unofficial tagline of the moment. Fans kept uploading slow motion edits and cropped zooms, treating the frame like a detective assignment.TPS amplified the conversation by highlighting screenshots where fans wrote, ""Bro is Shedeur Sanders wearing a thong???😭😭😭😭😭"" and ""Is Shedeur Sanders wearing a thong🤣.""Amid the internet frenzy, reporters and equipment specialists stepped in with the actual explanation. The visible strap was part of a standard athletic jockstrap, not lingerie. The gear has been common across contact sports for decades. It has an elastic waistband, a protective front pouch, and two straps that run under the buttocks. Those straps leave part of the area uncovered to prevent bulk under pads and allow mobility.High definition replays made the strap look similar to a thong. That optical confusion sustained the jokes even after multiple journalists clarified the equipment. Many fans admitted they had never seen what a jockstrap looks like when a player falls at a certain angle. One viewer responded with a simple line that summed up the tone of the discourse: “That is very weird.”The misunderstanding did not fade overnight. The clip kept circulating the next morning and remained one of the most shared NFL moments of the day even though it had nothing to do with gameplay.Shedeur Sanders threw for 364 yards, three passing touchdowns, and added his first NFL rushing touchdown in the game. He pushed the Cleveland Browns back into contention late in the fourth quarter. The team trailed 31-17 when he scrambled for a seven yard score. He later led an 80 yard touchdown drive to cut the Tennessee Titans lead to two points.Cleveland faced a potential game tying moment with a two point conversion. The Browns removed Shedeur Sanders from the field and ran a direct snap to running back Quinshon Judkins. The play failed. The Titans secured the 31-29 win and improved to 2-11. The Browns fell to 3-10, and both teams remained out of playoff contention.After the loss, Shedeur Sanders said, “I’ve been this way,” when asked about the late push and his confidence despite the noise surrounding the moment.Shedeur Sanders entered the league with heavy scrutiny after his draft slide and early season questions about Cleveland’s decision making with him in critical moments. The online reaction to the jockstrap clip has now overshadowed a productive performance that should have been the focus. Conversations about his mechanics, decision making, and late game execution took a back seat to a viral freeze frame.Instead of discussing his four touchdowns or his rally attempts, the public conversation shifted to a misunderstanding about protective equipment. The Browns have a short turnaround and a difficult schedule ahead, and Shedeur Sanders now has to answer for a moment that should never have turned into the main story of the night.","Shedeur Sanders threw for 364 yards, three passing touchdowns, and added his first NFL rushing touchdown in the game.

Donald Trump backs Roger Clemens before vote, but Hall of Fame voters stand firm

Roger Clemens was left out of the Baseball Hall of Fame once again, even after public support from Donald Trump. On Saturday night, December 6, 2025, Donald Trump posted a long message on Truth Social asking voters to induct Roger Clemens. The very next day, Sunday, December 7, the Hall of Fame committee released its results. Roger Clemens did not get enough votes.Barry Bonds also failed to make the cut. Jeff Kent ended up as the only player elected in this voting round. The result quickly upset many baseball fans, who shared their anger across social media.Donald Trump posted his message just one day before the Baseball Hall of Fame committee announced its decision.Writing on Truth Social, Trump called Roger Clemens “one of the greatest pitchers of all time.” He highlighted Clemens’ 354 career wins, seven Cy Young Awards, and six World Series appearances.Trump also pointed out that Roger Clemens never failed a drug test and was cleared in a federal case after testifying before Congress in 2008. “Rumors and innuendo kept him out,” Trump wrote, urging voters to “do the right thing.”Despite the appeal, the committee did not change its view. To enter the Hall of Fame, players needed at least 12 votes. Roger Clemens received fewer than five.Barry Bonds also failed to reach the minimum. Jeff Kent was named on 14 of the 16 ballots, making him the only inductee this time.Roger Clemens played 24 seasons in Major League Baseball, starring for the Boston Red Sox, Toronto Blue Jays, and New York Yankees. He won two World Series titles with the Yankees and threw two famous 20-strikeout games, one in 1986 and another ten years later.Still, his career remains tied to baseball’s steroid era. Roger Clemens was named in the 2007 Mitchell Report, which investigated steroid use in Major League Baseball.Former trainer Brian McNamee claimed he injected Clemens between 1998 and 2001. Former teammates also made similar claims. Clemens has always denied all accusations.After the vote, fans reacted strongly online. One post said the Hall of Fame “lost its meaning” by keeping out Clemens and Bonds. Another fan wrote that honoring only one player was “embarrassing” for the sport.The decision and the reactions were widely discussed on platforms like X and Instagram, showing that Roger Clemens’ Hall of Fame debate is far from over.Also Read: “White House Is On”: Conor McGregor Calls Out Islam Makhachev As He Aims For The UFC 170-Pound Welterweight Belt Next","Roger Clemens was named in the 2007 Mitchell Report, which investigated steroid use in Major League Baseball.

How Charlise Castro shaped her own career rather than being just a baseball wife

How George Springer and Charlise Castro's relationship grew through hard work and understanding

Charlise Castro’s life shows how identity and love can coexist for sports families

Charlise Castro’s life story reads far beyond the tag of being married to Toronto Blue Jays right fielder George Springer. She was a college standout long before she walked down the aisle, earning respect for her talent in softball and her later success in the wellness field. Her journey offers a look at how partners of elite athletes build their own paths while living in a world dominated by bright stadium lights and constant attention. Castro’s growth reflects ambition, resilience, and a firm belief that her identity deserves its own spotlight.Castro’s athletic journey began at the University at Albany where her strength at the plate turned her into a force in Division I softball. Her scholarship was earned, her achievements were celebrated, and her award as America East Player of the Year stamped her influence as one of the best young hitters in the country. Her selection to Puerto Rico’s national team only elevated her visibility, showing she could compete internationally. Yet her switch from professional play to personal development shows how she values reinvention over comfort.After graduating, Castro chose personal growth over lingering nostalgia for sport. She earned an MBA from the University of Saint Rose, taking her knowledge from the field into classrooms and business settings.That shift positioned her for a career in health, fitness, and wellness coaching where she could help others find confidence and balance. Her evolution showcases how athletes can turn discipline into leadership and passion into service.Castro has developed a quiet but credible space in the wellness world where she blends her business skills with lived athletic experience. Instead of promoting glamour without substance, she uses her platform to guide people toward stronger lifestyles. Even with Springer’s fame attracting followers, Castro’s work stands on its own credibility, supported by years of sport and education. She projects independence in a world where athlete spouses are often expected to stand behind.Castro first met Springer in 2011 when both were student athletes determining their futures. They bonded over long training days, competitive pressure, and goals that required sacrifice and patience. When Springer chased the majors, Castro chased academic achievement, creating parallel pursuits rather than one supporting role. Their connection deepened through understanding rather than dependency.The couple married in January 2018 in Newport Beach, California, in a setting suitable for two people balancing spotlight and family. The years since brought travel, clubhouse life, new homes, and eventually parenthood as they welcomed two children into the fold. Castro’s ability to nurture home life while working shows how she and Springer operate as a team, not as celebrity center and shadow. Their relationship reflects mutual ambition wrapped in family values.Today, Castro represents the changing narrative of partners in professional sports where wives create personal value instead of standing as silent figures on camera. Her athletic roots, career achievements, and steady role in Springer’s life make her part of his story without being overshadowed by it. Her journey is a reminder that balanced relationships in sports are built on choice, effort, and equal dreams. For George Springer, she remains his biggest supporter but also his truest match in drive and determination. Their story reminds everyone that shared ambition can build a lasting bond.Also read: Freddie Freeman and Ryan Reynolds’ SickKids video goes viral as fans explode with hilarious reactions online","Charlise Castro is the wife of Toronto Blue Jays right fielder George Springer.

Patriots’ positive signs on Will Campbell’s recovery



'Secret Sauce' Following BYE- Patriots HC Mike Vrabel Joins! Campbell Update? ||The Greg Hill Show

The New England Patriots received some encouraging news regarding rookie left tackle Will Campbell, who has been sidelined since Week 12 due to an MCL sprain. Campbell missed the team’s Week 13 matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals, and his placement on injured reserve meant he would be out for at least the next three games, with the Week 14 bye not counting toward the minimum four-week IR stay. For a team navigating a critical stretch of the regular season, any positive sign of recovery is a huge boost.While the initial injury reports were alarming, there is reason for optimism. Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer had labeled the injury a Grade 3 MCL sprain, suggesting a severe tear. However, recent observations indicate that Campbell’s progress may be better than expected. Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel offered an update that has fans hopeful, signaling that the rookie left tackle’s comeback could align well with the team’s playoff push.On the first practice following the team’s bye week, Campbell was seen walking through the locker room with no brace on his knee, later putting on only a sleeve. This simple detail suggests that the MCL sprain may not be as severe as initially feared. “So far, so good,” Coach Mike Vrabel said regarding Campbell’s recovery.Typically, an MCL sprain requires four to six weeks of recovery, depending on severity. If Campbell follows the shorter end of this timeline, he could return for the Week 18 regular-season finale, giving him time to regain his rhythm before the playoffs.On the other hand, if the recovery takes longer, the Patriots may need to carefully manage his return in postseason play.Securing the No. 1 seed would provide an additional week of rest, giving Campbell a better chance to return at full strength. For now, the visual progress and Vrabel’s positive comments offer reassurance that the team’s rookie left tackle is trending in the right direction. As the Patriots continue their late-season push, Campbell’s eventual return could prove crucial in protecting the quarterback and solidifying the offensive line for the postseason.Also Read: Josh Simmons injury update: NFL insider provides key details on Chiefs LT’s status after concerning week 13 setback","The New England Patriots received some encouraging news regarding rookie left tackle Will Campbell.

Spurs stay hopeful as Victor Wembanyama’s long-awaited return inches closer

San Antonio thrives without Wemby but eagerly awaits his dominant comeback

Victor Wembanyama of the San Antonio Spurs has missed the past ten games while recovering from a calf strain. The Spurs have maintained their hot start, sitting seventh in the Western Conference with a 15-7 record. But San Antonio isn't the same without the awe-inspiring Wembanyama, who could be returning after a three-week hiatus.Wembanyama hasn't played since November 14 due to a left calf issue, but he appears to be close to returning to action. McDonald had stated that Wembanyama was unlikely to play at all during the NBA Cup consolation schedule, ruling the superstar out of Monday's game in New Orleans and Wednesday's road game against the Lakers.The 7-foot-5 French great was once again leading the league in blocks, averaging career highs in many key statistical categories, and the San Antonio Spurs were positioned as early Western Conference contenders.However, according to veteran beat reporter Jeff McDonald of the San Antonio Express-News, Wembanyama will miss the Spurs' 11th consecutive game on Monday night, when they face the Pelicans in New Orleans.Wembanyama is classified as out on the Spurs injury report for their game against the New Orleans Pelicans on Monday, December 8. He is likely to miss his eleventh consecutive game. However, Wembanyama took full part in Sunday's practice. According to McDonald, Wemby will be deemed ""iffy"" to play Wednesday when the Spurs face the Los Angeles Lakers in an NBA Cup quarterfinal.However, according to Jeff McDonald of the San Antonio Express-News, Wembanyama (calf) participated fully in Sunday's practice. Wembanyama participated in Sunday's practice, and McDonald reports that the third-year prodigy is ""iffy"" for Wednesday's game, but unlikely to play Monday.While the information is optimistic for Wembanyama, it is unclear when he will suit up again. Following the two NBA Cup games, the Spurs played at home against the Wizards on December 17.Following Wednesday's 114-112 victory over the Orlando Magic, the Spurs hold the NBA's eighth-best offensive rating at 119.4. They had the league's ninth-best assist-to-turnover ratio at 2.0 after Wembanyama left with a strained calf, after ranking 23rd in the previous 12 games with him.San Antonio is 7-3 without Wembanyama and will need to go at least one more game without the All-Star center. However, they are on the verge of finally welcoming the 7 '5'' superstar back into the fold. In 12 games this season, Wembanyama has averaged 26.2 points, 12.9 rebounds, 4.0 assists, and 3.6 blocks.

With just over two minutes left in the third quarter, Washington Commanders tight end Zach Ertz soared for a high pass from backup quarterback Marcus Mariota on second-and-11. Launching himself skyward, the H-back missed the ball and took a brutal hit on his right knee from Minnesota Vikings safety Jay Ward.The impact sent Ertz tumbling over Ward in a chaotic, uninvited somersault. He remained on the turf for several minutes as trainers rushed to his side. When he tried to sit up, his right leg refused to support him, and he could not put any weight on it.The viral video captures Ertz’s knee snapping back with sickening elasticity after Ward’s helmet hits him. He clutched his right knee and was soon carted off the gridiron, a towel hiding his face as raw emotion took over: pain, frustration, and perhaps the dread of a season cut short. On the sideline, Mariota offered comfort while Ertz’s right leg, now braced, signaled the end of his night as he was ruled out in the fourth quarter.Chad Ryan, reporting on the Commanders from half a world away, posted the gut-wrenching footage of Ertz's injury on X. He described the moment as a “dirty hit” by Jay Ward that left Zach Ertz crumpled on the field, needing help from trainers to leave: “This is a dirty hit by Jay Ward (#24 Vikings) that has left Zach Ertz down on the field and needing assistance from the trainers to leave the field.No place for this on the football field. Disgusting play.”Ryan later shared another video showing the veteran tight end being carted off, his emotions raw and visible. If this marks the end of Ertz's career, he leaves as a true legend, ranked fifth all-time in receptions among NFL tight ends: “Heartbreaking. Zach Ertz, after taking a dirty hit to his knees by Jay Ward, visibly emotional on the cart. If that's the end of his career, he goes out a true legend, with the 5th most receptions by a Tight End in NFL history. ”NFL Insider Adam Schefter revealed that Commanders head coach Dan Quinn fears tight end Zach Ertz may have suffered a torn ACL, with tests set to confirm the extent of the injury. “Early signs say a serious injury,” Quinn told reporters. “This guy is one hell of a competitor in every way. To see frustration and emotion with that, all of us are feeling that.”Ertz, a cornerstone of the team, has inspired teammates and coaches alike with his relentless drive and professionalism. Fellow Commanders tight end John Bates said, “It breaks my heart when you see a great one like him, an all-time great [get hurt]. He does everything the right way, the way things should be done. He’s just a pro’s pro.”In the 2025 season, he tallied 50 catches for 504 yards, averaging 10.1 yards per reception, scoring four touchdowns, and losing the ball just once over 13 games.","Washington Commanders tight end Zach Ertz was carted off the field in the third quarter.

LeBron James delivers a crown worthy performance

LeBron James is a legend both on and off the court

The Los Angeles Lakers travelled all the way to Wells Fargo Centre, needing a spark after their 105-126 loss to the Boston Celtics. And LeBron James made sure they didn’t leave without one. In a closely contested 112–108 victory over the 76ers, the superstar delivered another reminder that age and injuries may slow him down, but they haven’t dimmed his brilliance.The win didn’t just energize the fanbase, it also caught the attention of Lakers legend and NBA icon Magic Johnson, who rarely misses an opportunity to hype up a team that reminds him of the electric Showtime era. He called this Lakers roster “the most entertaining team in the NBA right now.”Despite missing the last game due to sciatica, the same reason that forced him to miss the first 14 games, and lingering left foot arthritis, Lebron James played for 34 minutes and put up 29 points, 7 rebounds, and 6 assists, including a remarkable fourth-quarter stretch in which he poured in 11 consecutive points. Three straight three-pointers ignited the Lakers’ bench and silenced a hostile Philly crowd, proving once again that he can still take over games whenever he chooses.Luka Doncic, meanwhile, added his own masterpiece, a 31 points, 15 rebounds, 11 assists, triple-double, helping the Lakers improve to 17–6, keeping them at 2 in the Pacific Division. With this, Doncic also remains the player with the highest average points this season: 35.Taking to social media after the game, Magic Johnson couldn’t contain his excitement. He wrote, “LeBron James was nothing short of spectacular scoring 11 straight points in the 4th quarter (including three straight 3-pointers) and had 29 total points tonight to defeat the Philadelphia 76ers 112-108!”He added, “The NBA’s leading candidate for MVP, Luka Doncic, had a triple double with 31 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists! The Lakers are the most entertaining team in the NBA right now. ”Magic also highlighted the crowd’s reaction, a mix of awe and disbelief, as LeBron, Luka, and Austin Reaves traded big shots and dazzling plays throughout the night. For a fanbase that had been grumbling about inconsistency in recent weeks, the performance was a breath of fresh confidence.Due to Lakers’ inconsistent performances, some critics suggested that the management should look beyond LeBron James, but Sunday night served as a timely reminder of his ageless magic and ability to flip momentum and lift the entire roster.Off the court, James continues to support community work. Recently, he partnered with Amazon to deliver holiday essentials to families supported by the LeBron James Family Foundation. Students at the I Promise School were also surprised with brand-new LeBron XXIII sneakers, another gesture highlighting how deeply he remains connected to the people who shaped him.At 40, LeBron is still defying expectations on the hardwood floors, but off the court, he continues to support and lift the communities.Also Read: “Family” - LeBron James sends heartfelt message to fans from Toronto highlighting viral clip from post-ga","The Los Angeles Lakers beat the Philadelphia 76ers 112-108 on Sunday.

Texans’ defense dominates Chiefs while Patrick Mahomes struggles



Fans slam Patrick Mahomes as team battles uncertain 2025 season



The Kansas City Chiefs’ 2025 season has been a nightmare so far, with early defeats setting a troubling tone for a team expected to dominate. Their latest loss against the Houston Texans has intensified fan frustration, leaving many questioning the team’s strategy, execution, and Patrick Mahomes ’ role as the franchise quarterback.Patrick Mahomes, known for his clutch performances, faced harsh scrutiny after struggling throughout the game. His left knee, visibly injured during the matchup, became a hot topic among fans and analysts. While some believed Mahomes was using the injury as an excuse, others noted the relentless pressure from Houston’s defense, which left the Chiefs’ offense struggling to find any rhythm.In the Sunday showdown, Mahomes completed just 14-of-33 passes for 160 yards and threw three critical interceptions, resulting in one of the lowest passer ratings of his career. The Texans’ defense executed a perfect game plan, sacking and pressuring Mahomes relentlessly. During the third quarter, he was seen limping and using a heating pad on his left knee, fueling fan speculation that the injury might be exaggerated.Despite the backlash, reports confirm that Mahomes was indeed dealing with knee discomfort. However, the primary reason for the Chiefs’ defeat was the Texans’ defensive mastery.Kansas City’s offensive line struggled to protect their star quarterback, while turnovers and stalled drives ensured the Texans controlled the game from start to finish.Social media erupted with fans criticizing Patrick Mahomes, accusing him of exaggerating the knee injury to justify another loss. “Patrick Mahomes limps every game!! Like bro, we know you're faking! lol.,” one user wrote, while another added, “He's been doing that for years.” Others defended him, emphasizing the immense pressure faced by a quarterback leading a team under-performing this season. The Chiefs’ 2025 campaign continues to be a rollercoaster, and this latest defeat underscores the urgent need for better consistency and stronger offensive execution.Kansas City now turns its attention to Patrick Mahomes’ recovery and the team’s ability to come together. With early-season struggles behind them, every upcoming game is crucial if the Chiefs hope to turn their 2025 campaign around and keep playoff hopes alive. The team will need stronger execution on both offense and defense to regain momentum and compete at the highest level.Also Read: Will Campbell injury update: Coach Mike Vrabel reveals rookie left tackle’s recovery progress, says “so far, so good”","Kansas City Chiefs' 2025 season has been a nightmare so far, with early defeats setting a troubling tone for a team expected to dominate.

Sydney Sweeney rejects political labels as Perez Hilton claims she is “singing a much different tune”

Sydney Sweeney Is Not Happy Being Associated With MAGA Anymore! She Now Says:

Sydney Sweeney BREAKS SILENCE On Trump & Vance Praise; BLASTS ‘Great Jeans’ Backlash





Sydney Sweeney may have hoped a simple jeans campaign would stay in the realm of fashion, but the internet had other plans. After her American Eagle ad titled “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans” went viral for the wrong reasons last summer, the actress has faced everything from eugenics accusations to political labeling.The controversy escalated when the ad split social media, drew presidential commentary, and turned Sweeney into an unexpected lightning rod for conservative fandom. Her brief response in November, “The ad spoke for itself”, only intensified the divide. Now, Sweeney has finally opened up in more detail, offering clarity while pop culture commentator Perez Hilton questions what her shift may mean for her once-protective conservative fan base.In her December 5th interview with People, Sweeney addressed the backlash directly, for the first time acknowledging how her silence fed the fire. She explained her decision to participate in the campaign, clarifying that it was never driven by anything beyond a partnership with a brand she genuinely liked.“I was honestly surprised by the reaction. I did it because I love the jeans and love the brand. I don’t support the views some people chose to connect to the campaign.Many have assigned motives and labels to me that just aren’t true.”This open response marks a noticeable departure from the firm, non-engagement attitude she showed in her GQ interview, where she simply stated, “I think that when I have an issue that I wanna speak about, people will hear.”That shift caught Perez Hilton’s attention. On his podcast, he hinted that some conservative supporters may feel betrayed, stating, “#SydneySweeney has been a MAGA darling. Is that about to change? … she’s singing a much different tune!”Sweeney, however, insists her motivation isn’t political at all. She emphasized that staying quiet caused more harm than transparency, telling People, “I’m against hate and divisiveness… my silence regarding this issue has only widened the divide, not closed it.”With her new film The Housemaid premiering December 19, Sweeney hopes fans can refocus on storytelling instead of controversy. Whether this new chapter eases tensions or renews debate, her message is clear, she’s not picking sides; she’s pushing for unity.Also Read: “Provide a description…”: Candace Owens challenges Tim Pool’s shooting claim, demands proof after alleged attack","Sydney Sweeney addressed the controversy surrounding her American Eagle jeans campaign, clarifying her genuine appreciation for the brand.

Philip Rivers emerges as the Colts’ unexpected solution



Philip Rivers returned to the center of NFL conversations on Monday as the Colts searched for stability after a devastating blow to their season. With Daniel Jones sidelined for the year due to a torn Achilles, Indianapolis moved quickly to explore options that could keep its playoff hopes alive. That urgency led to a surprising development when NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo reported that Rivers will visit the team facility on Tuesday for a workout. The news arrived on his 44th birthday, creating a moment that blended timing, nostalgia and the possibility of an unexpected comeback.Rivers last suited up in 2020, a season that many believed marked the close of his long career. In that lone year with the Colts, he pushed the franchise into the postseason and provided the leadership they needed at the time. He has since stayed around the game while coaching high school football at St. Michael Catholic in Fairhope, Alabama. That school is also home to Colts rookie Riley Leonard, who views Rivers as a mentor. Their connection adds meaning to a reunion that feels sudden but not entirely out of place for the franchise.The quarterback room collapsed quickly for Indianapolis. Jones’s season-ending injury followed the earlier loss of Anthony Richardson, who remains out with a fractured orbital bone.Leonard is expected to start this week against the Seahawks, but he is navigating a knee issue after stepping in during the game against Jacksonville. These problems backed the Colts into a corner, leaving them with few choices and pushing them toward Rivers, who has not taken an NFL snap in four years.Rapoport underscored the urgency by posting, ""The Colts are planning to bring potential Hall of Fame QB Philip Rivers into their facility Tuesday to work out to see if he may join their practice squad, per me & Mike Garafolo. This is real. Daniel Jones’ season is over, Riley Leonard will start, but Rivers may be an option."" If he signs, he would instantly become the league’s oldest active player, edging out Aaron Rodgers.For a team trying to rescue a season slipping away, Rivers represents experience, calm and a familiar voice in the huddle. Now the Colts must decide whether this surprising path can guide them through the weeks ahead.Also Read: Madison Beer teases major career update as Justin Herbert prepares for crucial Chargers–Eagles showdown","Philip Rivers will work out for the Indianapolis Colts on Tuesday.

Ann Michael Maye’s TikTok baking fame fuels Patriots buzz

Drake Maye’s wife Ann Michael Maye has become a surprising highlight of the Patriots season, and it has nothing to do with football stats or playbooks. Her TikTok baking videos have turned into a daily event for fans, and the New England Patriots are getting a sweet taste of it, too. Coach Mike Vrabel revealed that the treats filling her feed are not only real but show up in the building, and he has tried some himself. With the team sitting at 11-2 and enjoying a bye week, Ann Michael kept her own streak alive with her steady flow of “Bakemas” creations, including a cinnamon sourdough loaf that had viewers hooked.Fans have crowded her comments with praise, pushing her TikTok engagement past 2.5 million likes. Long before the latest surge, she was already baking themed treats for game days. Before the Patriots’ last win, she made Patriots-style M&M and chocolate chip cookies, and she called Thanksgiving her “Super Bowl.” Now the attention has shifted again after Vrabel admitted he sampled her apple crisp bars and said they were “delicious. ” He also said, “She brings them in for the O-lineman.” That sounds like a pretty strong game plan on its own.The rest of the roster might be wondering when their turn is coming, but fans have gotten plenty to enjoy. Ann Michael has also made waves in the stands with outfits that grab attention, like her full New England blue look and the all-red Patriots style that drew compliments online. Her growing presence blends lifestyle, team pride and a sense of fun that Patriots supporters have embraced during an intense season.Her connection to football runs deeper than social media. Drake was a standout quarterback at North Carolina before becoming the No. 3 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. Ann Michael attended college with him, and her brother Tad played quarterback alongside Drake. The two married on June 21 in North Carolina, beginning a new chapter just as Drake’s NFL journey took off.Now the Patriots turn to a huge matchup against the Buffalo Bills on December 14. If the O-line is powered by Ann Michael’s baked goods, Drake Maye might walk into Sunday with the sweetest protection in the league.Also Read: Former ‘First Take’ star Molly Qerim turns heads in Abu Dhabi as her glamorous F1 race-day look proves she’s a style icon off-camera","Drake Maye's wife Ann Michael Maye has become a surprising highlight of the Patriots season.

Jaylen Brown earns spotlight after NBA announcement



Boston Celtics thriving while Jayson Tatum recovers



The Boston Celtics walked out of their fifth straight victory with more than momentum in their pockets. Jaylen Brown, already carrying the bulk of the team’s offense this season, added another personal milestone as the NBA unveiled its latest honors. His surge has shaped Boston’s push up the standings, and the league’s announcement highlighted how central he has become during a stretch defined by heavy usage and consistent production. The recognition arrived as another marker in a season where Brown has stepped into a starring role.The NBA named Brown the Eastern Conference Player of the Week after he powered the Celtics through an undefeated run against the New York Knicks, Los Angeles Lakers, and Toronto Raptors. His numbers during that span reflected an elite rhythm in December first week: 34 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 5.7 assists on efficient splits from every level. Boston improved to 15-9 with the streak, climbing back into the top tier of the East.Jaylen Brown opened the week with a statement performance, adding 42 points on 66.7 percent shooting against the Knicks, the team that ended Boston’s 2025 postseason. His impact touched every part of the game, including a team-best plus/minus of plus-15.The Celtics noted the performance marked “Brown’s 14th career 40-point game, third of the season, and second in four days.”Even an illness that kept him out against the Washington Wizards didn’t interrupt his rhythm. He returned to score back-to-back 30-point outings against the Lakers and Raptors, adding eight rebounds in both games. His recent stretch includes nine games with at least 20 points, fueling Boston’s rise.This season has also brought career-high averages across major categories. The absence of Jayson Tatum, who has been recovering from an Achilles injury, opened a window for Brown to run the offense. The departures of Al Horford, Jrue Holiday, and Kristaps Porzingis put even more weight on his shoulders. He has answered with efficient scoring, improved playmaking, and steady leadership.Head coach Joe Mazzulla has pushed the Celtics forward with a rotation built around Brown, Derrick White, Neemias Queta, Payton Pritchard, and Anfernee Simons. All but Simons are posting career-high scoring averages. The team sits fifth in net rating and second in offensive rating.After the win over Toronto, Mazzulla shrugged off questions about the standings, saying, “No, it doesn’t mean anything. It doesn’t show you anything. There are ebbs and flows along the way in the league. At the end of the day, we have a clear identity of who we are.”A late-season Tatum return remains possible, but Brown’s surge keeps Boston stable and dangerous.Also Read: Why Desmond Bane was fined?

Why Desmond Bane was fined during the Knicks loss



Desmond Bane’s reaction and the aftermath with OG Anunoby



Orlando Magic guard Desmond Bane found himself at the center of unwanted attention after a fourth-quarter flare-up during the team’s 106-100 loss to the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden. The league reviewed the sequence and determined that his actions crossed the line, leading to a significant penalty that immediately became one of the most discussed moments of the night. The fine stems from a tense exchange with OG Anunoby that shifted the spotlight away from the game and onto Bane’s judgment in a critical stretch.The NBA confirmed that Bane would face a $35,000 financial hit for his conduct, marking a frustrating end to a tight matchup for Orlando. The moment unfolded with a little over six minutes left, turning a routine fast-break scramble into a controversial incident that drew sharp reactions from players, fans, and analysts.According to Executive Vice President and Head of Basketball Operations James Jones, the punishment was issued for “throwing the game ball with force at an opponent in an unsportsmanlike manner” (via NBA.com). The play began when OG Anunoby missed a fast-break layup and tumbled out of bounds while Anthony Black stripped the ball loose.As the ball bounced back in play, Bane scooped it up and fired it straight at Anunoby, who was still off the floor. The officials immediately assessed a technical foul.The sequence stunned the Knicks crowd. Even Anunoby appeared confused by the decision before shoving Bane in response. Fans inside the Garden let Bane hear it, and the exchange quickly spread across social media. DeMarcus Cousins weighed in on the “Run It Back” show, saying, “I'm not saying punch him in the face, but maybe slap the s*** out of him,” adding fuel to an already heated discussion.Despite the chaos in the moment, both players cooled down once the final buzzer sounded. Bane and Anunoby shared a brief laugh and a handshake at midcourt, signaling no lingering hostilities. Still, the league viewed the act as excessive, reinforcing its stance with the sizable fine.Bane finished the contest with 16 points, while Anunoby posted 21 for New York.Also Read: Young LeBron James once made a flip phone flex at WWE Monday Night Raw 2003, and it now feels like a time capsule","Orlando Magic guard Desmond Bane was fined $35,000 for throwing the game ball at New York Knicks' OG Anunoby.

Jonathan Kuminga moving to Sacramento Kings? Golden State Warriors’ rotation twist puts star's future under trade spotlight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/jonathan-kuminga-moving-to-sacramento-kings-golden-state-warriors-rotation-twist-puts-stars-future-under-trade-spotlight/articleshow/125852082.cms,"Jonathan Kuminga is now facing trade issues (Image via NBA)

Kuminga’s shrinking role sparks fresh trade buzz as Warriors near his January 15 eligibility

Kuminga’s injury-hit start fuels trade speculation ahead of January 15 eligibility

Jonathan Kuminga, the Golden State Warriors' fourth-highest-paid player, was not among the 11 players that started Sunday night's 123-91 victory over the Chicago Bulls, despite the absences of Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, and Al Horford.Warriors supporters may have hoped Kuminga would be the key to landing a bigger fish, but his latest benching and previous problems may have eliminated that possibility. However, current reports imply that the Sacramento Kings are still interested in obtaining Jonathan Kuminga.Jonathan Kuminga's days with the Golden State Warriors might be numbered. Like, specifically numbered. Now that the 23-year-old swingman has once again fallen out of Steve Kerr's rotation, it appears that the Warriors will sell Kuminga as soon as he becomes trade-eligible on January 15.ESPN's Anthony Slater recently described the prospects of a Kuminga trade as ""strong,"" and it's reasonable to question whether that assessment was quite strong enough.“The Sacramento Kings continue to have interest in acquiring Jonathan Kuminga, but while Malik Monk might still be available in a package, the previously included first-round pick is no longer expected to be part of Sacramento’s offer, per @MarcJSpears…”Especially with the ideal trade proposal featuring Kuminga before them.Kuminga's fifth season with the Warriors, like his previous four, has garnered consistent interest despite his unpredictable playing time in an organization that has never seemed to be a perfect fit.After a rocky restricted free agency prolonged into training camp, Kuminga returned on a two-year, $46.8 million contract with a team option for the second season -- a team-friendly, tradeable structure that he felt forced to accept, according to league sources at the time. The negotiations elicited harsh feelings on both sides.His trade worth alone is insufficient to entice Andrew Wiggins back to the Bay, and Kuminga can only be viewed as a little sweetener for any Giannis Antetokounmpo offers. Warriors coach Steve Kerr commented on not playing Kuminga:""Happens to everybody pretty much, other than the stars… Guys come in and out of the rotation, depending on who's available, how the team is playing.""Kuminga's eventful restricted free agency this summer came to a conclusion on September 30 when he signed a two-year, $46.8 million contract with Golden State.He made headlines in the first two weeks of the season, averaging 17.2 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 3.1 assists in the first nine games before suffering bilateral knee tendinitis four games later in the Warriors' victory against the San Antonio Spurs on November 12, which sidelined him for seven games.Kuminga becomes trade eligible on January 15. According to league sources, the Warriors are anticipated to investigate the Kuminga trade market in the coming weeks as the chances of a split before the February deadline remain high.Also read: Is Jonathan Kuminga playing tonight?

Resident Evil Requiem GameStop listing leak



Resident Evil Requiem timeline puzzle



The highly anticipated survival horror title, Resident Evil Requiem, is gearing up for its expected launch early next year. It is among the most-awaited releases, and fans are expecting a lot from the game.A recent slip-up by retailer GameStop may have revealed a major addition to the game’s narrative. According to a listing for the Deluxe Edition, a returning fan-favorite character may join the protagonist as a second playable character.The section below provides you with all the information about the Resident Evil Requiem GameStop listing leak.Speculation about Resident Evil Requiem has been messy for months, with loads of conflicting rumors. This has left the fans guessing about what to expect from the game.In a new development, there has been a rumor, which stems from a screenshot shared by a Reddit user showing the GameStop listing for the Resident Evil Requiem Deluxe Edition. Essentially, the listing reportedly mentioned bonus cosmetics for Rose alongside outfits for the only previously confirmed playable character, Grace Ashcroft.The mention of Rose, or Rosemary Winters, the daughter of Ethan Winters from Resident Evil Village, immediately stood out.Although the listing was quickly edited to remove any mention of her, this has further intensified speculation that GameStop has accidentally revealed a key part of the game's story earlier than Capcom intended.Accordingly, you can expect Rose to play a vital role in the game. Nevertheless, her involvement is still a bit puzzling, given the timeline of the upcoming title.If the leak about Rose is true, it presents a strange narrative puzzle for fans. Previous franchise producer Masato Kumazawa has confirmed that returning characters would appear in Requiem, so Rose's involvement is not out of the question. However, in the timeline of Grace Ashcroft's story, Rose would only be about six or seven years old, making it unlikely for her to be a full survival-horror playable character. The only logical explanation for the inclusion of her bonus cosmetics is a potential time jump or a separate playable segment set years after Grace’s main story.The highly anticipated game is officially set to appear at The Game Awards on December 11, and you can anticipate further details to be revealed during the same. There is a chance that the mystery surrounding Rose Winters will be unveiled as part of the same. Additionally, the heavily rumored return of Leon S. Kennedy (who would be noticeably older in this timeline) is also expected at TGA 2025. Thus, all eyes are on Capcom at the upcoming showcase.","The highly anticipated survival horror title, Resident Evil Requiem, is gearing up for its expected launch early next year.

NFL insider on Josh Simmons’ status after severe wrist injury



The Kansas City Chiefs are navigating a difficult stretch after left tackle Josh Simmons went down with a serious wrist injury in Week 13. His absence has created major concern within the organization, especially as the Chiefs enter a critical phase of the season where protection and stability up front matter more than ever. Simmons had been emerging as a reliable presence on the offensive line, making this setback particularly significant.The injury occurred during the loss to the Dallas Cowboys, and the aftermath quickly shifted the narrative around Kansas City’s offensive plans. With Simmons placed on injured reserve, the team now faces a crucial adjustment period as they await further clarity on his recovery. The uncertainty around his timeline has fueled questions about how the Chiefs will manage the left tackle position in the weeks ahead and whether a return this season is still possible.While the Chiefs have refrained from offering a definitive update, recent insight from NFL insider Ian Rapoport suggests that Simmons is out indefinitely, though not officially ruled out for the remainder of the year. That distinction has kept a glimmer of hope alive, even if the path back remains challenging.Head coach Andy Reid echoed that sentiment, ""We'll just see about the recovery on that, where it goes from there,"" noting that Simmons underwent successful surgery and is already focused on his rehabilitation.Reid highlighted the young tackle’s determination and work ethic, explaining that the team will monitor his progress before making any decisions about a potential return. With standard IR rules in place, the earliest Simmons could step back onto the field is Week 18, but given the severity of the injury, that scenario remains uncertain.If Simmons is to rejoin Kansas City this season, the timeline likely hinges on a deep playoff run that buys him additional recovery time. Until then, the Chiefs are expected to rely on Wanya Morris to shoulder responsibilities at left tackle. His performance will be crucial as Kansas City looks to maintain offensive consistency without one of its key blockers. For now, Josh Simmons’ status remains a developing story, with the Chiefs hoping his recovery progresses in time to make an impact down the stretch.Also Read: “He’s like a pitbull”: Micah Parsons praises Keisean Nixon after game-saving interception seals Packers’ win over Bears","Kansas City Chiefs left tackle Josh Simmons went down with a serious wrist injury in Week 13.

Lockie Ferguson interview: Why he will never cut down on pace | ILT20 cricket and more

NEW DELHI: Indian pacer Shardul Thakur , who was traded to Mumbai Indians (MI) from Lucknow Super Giants for Rs 2 crore ahead of IPL 2026, said former skipper Rohit Sharma played a key role in helping him feel confident and express himself freely. The 34-year-old, part of India’s Test squad during the England tour earlier this year, is hopeful of reliving the ""good old days"" at his former franchise.""Abhi aur pata chalega jab saath me baithenge toh. Kaafi masti hogi,"" said Shardul, looking forward to reuniting with his “chaos partner” Rohit.Reflecting on their bond, he added, ""He made me comfortable, he allowed me to be free with him, he allowed me to express myself. We became comfortable with each other and he played a major part in it,"" as quoted on the Mumbai Indians website.Shardul’s association with MI began long before his IPL career took off — back in 2010, when he joined the squad as a support bowler. He said that early exposure helped shape his cricketing journey.""I was lucky enough to experience the dressing room early in my days. I was already feeling comfortable in front of senior players.Somewhere down the line, whatever the way I was treated during Mumbai Indians camp also, that small gesture from the Mumbai Indians helped me a lot to grow in my career.""I was made to play practice games. I bowled with a new ball, so that boosted my morale and confidence to another level, and I was picking wickets.""He credited coaches Rahul Sanghvi and Paras Mhambrey for guiding him through his developmental years, but said the most surreal part was sharing space with icons.""I was seeing Sachin Tendulkar, Harbhajan Singh , Munaf Patel, Andrew Symonds, Rohit Sharma, Ambati Rayudu… and I’m sharing the same dressing room with them. It was surreal,"" said Shardul, who has represented India in 13 Tests, 47 ODIs and 25 T20Is since his debut in 2017.Shardul also shared memories from his younger days in Mumbai, when simply catching a glimpse of cricket royalty felt magical.""So whenever the train passed, we used to get up from our seats, come near the door, and try to sneak in and see who's practising. Even getting a glimpse of the great Sachin Tendulkar playing, we would have been happy,"" he recalled.","Shardul Thakur has joined Mumbai Indians from Lucknow Super Giants.

Poll Do you agree with Suryakumar Yadav on the importance of playing domestic cricket to stay match-ready? Yes, it's essential for performance. No, international practice is enough.

CUTTACK: Not having a great time with the bat, Suryakumar Yadav stressed on the importance of playing domestic cricket whenever possible to be match ready. India's T20 skipper has failed to score a half-century in his last 20 innings and five SMAT matches recently, where he scored only 165 runs in five games, and his strike rate has plummeted to below 130 from close to 190 back in 2022.“You should never forget your roots. Whenever there is no international cricket, all the players go and play domestic cricket. It is a good challenge there, because when you come here, it becomes easy for you because you work very hard there. If you look at the players who went there, for example, Abhishek (Sharma) and a lot of players among us went to play Mushtaq Ali. You always stay in touch, you get to learn a lot from that,” Yadav said.On preparation for the T20 World Cup early next year, he added in jest, “Our 2026 T20 World Cup preparation began right after we won the T20 World Cup in 2024. Because for any big tournament, you cannot start preparing when the tournament is nearby. It's like when we appear for exams in school, it is not like we try to study everything in the last four days. We study for a year or two. Our preparation is similar.”“I feel, in the last 5-6 series which we have played, we have tried and played with a similar combination.We have not changed too much. We don't want to change a lot going into the next two series also.”Key players Shubman Gill and Hardik Pandya's comebacks will still force some changes in the side, and Yadav is happy with the problem of plenty. “What you saw in Asia Cup also, when Pandya was bowling the new ball, he opened a lot of options, lot of combinations for us with respect to playing XI. That's what he brings to the table. His experience, the way he has done really well in all the matches, all bigger games in ICC events, all ACC events. I think that experience will count a lot. His presence will definitely give a good balance to the side,” said Yadav.Yadav pointed out the need for T20 batters to be flexible with their batting positions. “Other than openers, everyone has to be very flexible in T20Is. The thing is all the batters from No. 3 to 7 are capable of batting at any position. For example, you might see Tilak Verma batting at No. 6 some day. You might see Dubey as you saw in Australia. Dubey went in to bat at No. 3. So, it depends what the entry point is of a batter. So, we have to be flexible. ”","India's T20 skipper has failed to score a half-century in his last 20 innings and five SMAT matches. Yadav scored only 165 runs in five games, and his strike rate has plummeted to below 130 from close to 190 back in 2022.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125861210,imgsize-115630,width-400,resizemode-4/suryakumar-yadav.jpg"
