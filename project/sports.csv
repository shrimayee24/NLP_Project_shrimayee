""The mighty fortune gained by men devoid of character





Is like pure milk spoilt by impurity of container.""

Whenunveiled the reconstructed faces of Keeladi men who lived 2,500 years ago, it felt like a moment of time travel. The skulls excavated from Keeladi had been carefully studied and brought to life by researchers from the UK. Their eyes, jawlines, and foreheads appeared deeply familiar — like gazing into a mirror that stretched across millennia.From the artefacts recovered — carbon dated to 600 BCE — names that echo through Sangam literature emerge;and. It is thrilling to see the torches of archaeology and ancient poetry illuminating the same path through our shared past.Reading theis no less than an archaeological dig. With each couplet, we brush away the dust of time and catch glimpses of a civilization that once breathed on the same soil. Valluvar may not have held a chisel, but his pen was as precise.Homes were called(Kural 340). The inner courtyard — today’s living space — was(Kural 720). Doors were bolted (Kural 1251). People drew drinking water from(Kural 215). Women bracelets called(Kural-1101), and heavy studs in their ears referred to as(Kural 1081). In one unforgettable image, Valluvar paints a picture of a woman marking each day her husband is away, scratching lines on the wall to keep count (Kural 1261). Love was not a fleeting romance — it was record-keeping.Occupations of the time unfold too — farmers, weavers, palanquin bearers, carpenters, hunters, soldiers, barbers, potters, religious pundits, and goldsmiths. Agriculture was not just a profession, it was revered. Crops like sugarcane (Kural 1078), sesame (Kural 889), and millets (Kural 104) were grown with care. Farmers drew from wells (Kural 396) and spring waters (Kural 1161). “If the farmer tills properly,” Valluvar wrote in Kural 1037, “no manure is needed.” A principle that would echo well with modern soil scientists’ warning against nutrient run-off and pollution.A few months ago, I was running late and requested my daughter to heat the sambar I had made. When I returned, I saw her using the vessel meant for boiling milk. I snapped. “You’re using the milk vessel for sambar?”She looked baffled. “What’s wrong with that?”I explained: “Milk vessels are always kept separate. The ladle too. If you use them for other foods, the next time you boil milk, it may curdle.”She looked at me suspiciously. “Is this a new house rule?”“It’s a rule, yes,” I said, switching off the stove and quickly transferring the sambar. “But it’s not new. It’s been followed in households like ours for over 2,000 years.She raised an eyebrow. “Because there’s evidence — not archaeological, but literary,” I said. In, Valluvar uses the metaphor of pure milk turning bad because of an unclean vessel to speak of wealth in the hands of the undeserving. Valluvar even uses the termfor vessels exclusively used only for milk.”She paused, then said, “Sometimes you are proud because you started something new. But sometimes you're proud because you are part of a continuum — something that’s been going on for centuries.”I couldn’t agree more. That’s exactly why the images from Keeladi gave me goosebumps. It was a proud, humbling reminder: We are not the beginning of anything. We are a single link in a chain forged long before us—and if we are mindful, a link that will hold firm for generations to come.","The Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

AI meets Ayodhya: Young drama group stages Pak's 1st Ramayana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ai-meets-ayodhya-young-drama-group-stages-paks-1st-ramayana/articleshow/122773587.cms,"Young drama group stages Pak’s 1st Ramayana

‘This is a story of universal values, a story of ours to tell’

If Ram could send one tweet from the forest, what would he say? If Raavan could do a TED talk, what would it be titled? A week before the premiere of ‘ Ramayana ’ at the Arts Council of Pakistan in Karachi on July 11, 30-year-old finance grad-turned-director Yogeshwar Karera shot off Karan Johar-style rapid-fire questions at his cast for a social media promo.This was no ordinary stage production — the Hindu epic had never been performed in Pakistan before. The cast was entirely Muslim, except for the director, and the play used AI to enhance storytelling. Despite recent Indo-Pak tensions, it sold around 1,000 tickets and generated buzz on both sides of the border.“We weren’t expecting such a response,” says Karera, surprised by the congratulatory messages pouring in for Mauj Collective, the theatre group he co-founded a year ago. He says the near-war between the two countries did not impact the play. “The sponsors and venues had no reservations at all about staging it. Only the media has asked us these questions. In fact, it didn’t even cross our minds that this might be seen as sensitive or controversial,” says Raana Kazmi, co-founder of Mauj Collective with a day job in human resources.People from all backgrounds came, regardless of their religion.Families with kids, students, the elderly, everyone. A friend told me about how a parent explained each scene to their child,” says Kazmi, who played the role of Sita. Samhan Ghazi brought fierce intensity to the role of Raavan. Karera, a Sindhi who moved to Karachi in his teens, says his fascination for the epic tale of good triumphing over evil started young.“I was five years old when I first watched Ramanand Sagar’s Ramayan on Doordarshan. The story grabbed me from the start,” says Karera, who decided to pursue theatre full time in the middle of his finance and accounting degree.After getting a diploma at the National Academy of Performing Arts in Pakistan, Karera and two friends, Kazmi and Sana Toaha, founded Mauj Collective. The year-old theatre troupe uses tech-savvy stagecraft, social media flair and scripts that speak to a younger generation.Although some have interpreted Mauj’s ‘Ramayana’ as a statement on religious unity, the group maintains their goal wasn’t about sending a message. “None of us ever felt like we were telling a story outside the world we inhabit. I’ve grown up with this story of the Ramayana. I may not belong to the community religiously, but this is a story of our subcontinent. It never felt like the story wasn’t ours to tell. The values in it are universal,” says Ashmal Lalwany, who played Ram in the production.Some Sanskrit and Hindi words were adapted to terms more familiar to a Karachi audience. For instance, ‘prakriti’ became ‘kudrat’. Sometimes, this would lead to amusing confusion. “In one scene, Hanuman is supposed to give me a ring.Now, I know the word ‘anguthi’ means ‘ring,’ and that’s it. But one day during rehearsal, Jibran Khan (who plays Hanuman) says, “Aap is mundrika ko dekhein”. I was just standing there like, ‘Where am I supposed to look? What is a mundrika?” laughs Kazmi.","Young drama group stages Pak’s 1st Ramayana in Karachi. The Hindu epic had never been performed in Pakistan before.

The friendship bracelet was just the beginning of Travis Kelce’s clever pursuit

Everyone warned Travis Kelce: “Do not f–k this up”



While their relationship now feels like a fairytale played out on NFL sidelines and Eras Tour stages, the early days of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce ’s romance were anything but accidental. In fact, Kelce has openly admitted that he didn’t just rely on charm — he employed strategy, bold moves, and even a bit of backup from Swift’s own inner circle.On his New Heights podcast back in 2023, Kelce shocked listeners by revealing that he went to one of Swift’s Eras Tour concerts with a clear mission — to get her attention. He crafted a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it, hoping to hand it to the pop megastar. “I had someone playing cupid,” Kelce later told The Wall Street Journal in November 2023, confirming that a secret matchmaker inside Swift’s circle was feeding him helpful information about her.Though he never named the person, Kelce credited the mystery “cupid” with giving him valuable insight and helping him make his move at the right time. The insider even said Kelce was “lucky enough” to have her support — a wink at just how calculated this courtship really was.Their first date, which reportedly took place in New York City, came with high stakes. According to Kelce, he was surrounded by friends and family who all delivered the same brutally honest warning: “Do not f–k this up.”The pressure was real, but so was his determination. “I was never going to give up,” Kelce told WSJ, noting that no matter how untouchable Swift seemed, he was willing to risk rejection just for a chance.Looking back, the calculated beginning of their romance only adds to the depth of what has become one of pop culture’s most celebrated couples. It turns out that Swift’s So High School lyrics weren’t just romantic fantasy — they were pulled straight from Kelce’s playbook of confident pursuit.Also Read: Are Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce halting Selena Gomez’s wedding?

Theare reportedly holding off on extending Mikal Bridges’ contract this offseason, and it may have everything to do with the uncertainty surrounding Milwaukee Bucks superstarAccording to Ian Begley of SNY, the New York Knicks are one of several teams monitoring the trade situation involving Giannis Antetokounmpo. The decision to delay Bridges’ extension appears tied to maintaining flexibility in the event Giannis becomes available.“The Knicks and all the other teams are kind of keeping an eye on Milwaukee and what may or may not happen there,” Begley said. “I think one of the reasons why (Bridges) has not been extended yet is because once you extend him, you cannot trade him for six months…”This six-month no-trade clause following a player’s extension is a crucial factor. If the New York Knicks extend Bridges now, it would rule him out of any blockbuster trade package until midseason. Given the magnitude of a potential Giannis Antetokounmpo deal, New York is keeping its options open.Antetokounmpo’s future has been a major storyline this offseason. While speculation ramped up earlier this summer, momentum has shifted toward him remaining in Milwaukee.In May, ESPN’s Shams Charania reported that Giannis had not made a firm decision about his future with the Bucks and was “open-minded” about exploring other possibilities. However, things have cooled since then:Feigin further added during a recent NBA TV appearance, “Giannis loves Milwaukee, Milwaukee loves Giannis… We feel great about it.It’s business as usual.”Despite these public reassurances, only Giannis truly knows his next move. The door hasn’t closed completely, which explains why teams like the Knicks remain cautiously hopeful.For New York, a chance to add a player like Giannis Antetokounmpo would transform their status in the league. They’re already a top contender after acquiring Karl-Anthony Towns to pair with Jalen Brunson. Adding Giannis would elevate them from contenders to clear favorites in the East.Until Giannis Antetokounmpo’s future is locked in, it’s logical for the New York Knicks to avoid committing to any moves that might limit trade options—even if that includes a delay in rewarding Bridges with a well-earned contract extension.Mikal Bridges proved to be a valuable addition in his first year with the Knicks. He averaged 17.6 points per game, serving as a reliable third scoring option behind Brunson and Towns.Bridges is currently entering the final year of his four-year, $90.9 million contract. Based on his performance and fit in the Knicks’ system, an extension seems inevitable—just not until the Giannis Antetokounmpo saga reaches its conclusion.New York Knicks’ Calculated Approach Signals Long-Term AmbitionThe Knicks’ management is playing the long game. While Mikal Bridges has shown he’s deserving of a new deal, the front office is prioritizing flexibility—especially with a generational talent like Antetokounmpo potentially in play.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Could Land $86.6 Million Orlando Magic Superstar in Bold Three-Team Trade Proposal New York fans may need to be patient, but this strategic pause could pay off massively if it results in a once-in-a-decade acquisition.","Mikal Bridges is entering the final year of his four-year, $90.9 million contract with the New York Knicks.

Justin Tucker’s potential NFL return: Ravens’ ‘football decision’ sparks bigger debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/justin-tuckers-potential-nfl-return-ravens-football-decision-sparks-bigger-debate/articleshow/122773919.cms,"Justin Tucker eyes NFL return after controversial Ravens exit (Getty Images)

Baltimore’s all-time kicker still wants to play, but is the NFL ready for his comeback?

The Ravens’ future rests with rookie Tyler Loop—for now

NFL teams watching closely as suspension countdown begins

The Baltimore Ravens shocked the NFL world earlier this offseason when they cut ties with longtime kicker Justin Tucker, a franchise legend whose resume includes a Super Bowl ring, seven Pro Bowl nods, and the highest field goal conversion rate in NFL history. But the controversy surrounding his departure wasn’t just about on-field production—it was about timing, messaging, and the league’s tolerance for off-field allegations.Despite Tucker's unprecedented accuracy—417 of 468 career field goals at 89.1 percent—the Ravens released him following serious accusations from over 16 massage therapists in the Baltimore area. Though Tucker has denied all allegations, he agreed to serve a 10-game suspension issued by the NFL, sidelining him until at least Week 11 of the 2025 season.Still, some insiders believe Tucker isn’t done just yet. ""By maintaining that cutting Tucker was a football decision, the Ravens kept the door open for a reunion,"" wrote Ravens insider Jeff Zrebiec of The Athletic. ""Still, they’d have to be in a pretty tough spot to make that call. I might be in the minority here, but I believe Tucker will kick again in the NFL. All indications are that he wants to.""Baltimore attempted to turn the page by drafting rookie Tyler Loop in the sixth round of the 2025 NFL Draft.The move, while strategic, now looks risky given the magnitude of who Tucker was to the franchise. If Loop falters, expect the fanbase and media alike to revisit DeCosta’s controversial explanation.""Sometimes football decisions are incredibly difficult, and this is one of those instances,"" DeCosta said. ""Considering our current roster, we have made the tough decision to release Justin Tucker.""Many fans remain unconvinced that this was solely a “football decision.” The optics surrounding the release—coinciding with misconduct allegations—have left room for skepticism. Bringing Tucker back would only intensify that scrutiny.Tucker will be eligible to return to the league on November 11, just ahead of Week 11. With kicking struggles a constant around the NFL, the door remains open for a team desperate for consistency. If the Ravens don’t act, someone else might.One thing is clear: Tucker still wants to kick. Whether any team wants to take the public relations hit to sign him remains to be seen. But in the NFL, talent often gets a second chance—especially when it’s historically great.Also Read: Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson’s bathroom decor goes viral after fans connect it to Taylor Swift’s 'Clara Bow' song","Justin Tucker was released by the Baltimore Ravens earlier this offseason.

Jelly Roll didn’t hold back when talking about Taylor Swift on ESPN’sthis week. While praising a few of his favorite artists, the country-rapper lit up the moment Swift’s name entered the conversation. From Miami workouts to worldwide stages, Swift has remained a dominating cultural force—and she’s got more than fans in her corner. Jelly Roll declared her the undisputed “GOAT,” and made it clear he’s willing to fight for that title. As for Travis Kelce ? The NFL superstar and Swift’s partner was right there to show his appreciation—with a laugh, a high-five, and a comment Swifties won’t forget.During his visit to The Pat McAfee Show, Jelly Roll, 40, praised several artists he admires, including Morgan Wallen and Post Malone. But it was when he brought up Taylor Swift, 35, that things got more animated.“She’s the GOAT!” he declared live on ESPN. “I will fistfight anybody who says otherwise. Travis, don’t even worry—I got this one. You know what I mean? She’s the GOAT.”That bold take sparked instant attention online—especially when Travis Kelce chimed in. Travis Kelce , also 35, saw the clip and didn’t stay quiet.

Natasha Cloud: A Voice Beyond Basketball

Why She’s Still Undervalued

In a league that often spotlights scorers and viral moments, it’s easy to overlook the glue players—the ones who build chemistry, drive accountability, and turn teams into contenders. Butisn’t just any role player. She’s the heartbeat of every roster she touches, a vocal leader and elite competitor whose impact extends far beyond the numbers. Natasha Cloud has long commanded respect across the WNBA for her tenacious leadership, vocal presence, and ability to lift everyone around her. Whether it’s during shootaround or the final minutes of a game, her influence is unmistakable. Teammates consistently praise her leadership skills, including Mercury guard Sophie Cunningham, who called her “our best leader so far,” citing Cloud’s on- and off-court communication as a catalyst for team cohesion.On the floor, Cloud is a cerebral floor general. Her career assist-to-turnover ratio of 2.65 reflects a player who brings control, structure, and decision-making precision—particularly in crunch time. Her value isn’t just on offense. Cloud’s resume includes two WNBA All-Defensive Team selections, and her ability to contain top-tier guards adds immense value on the other end of the court.Natasha Cloud’s presence immediately transforms team dynamics.Her debut for the Liberty in 2025, after a post-2024 trade from Phoenix and Connecticut, was a masterclass in two-way dominance: 22 points, 6 rebounds, 9 assists, 3 steals, and 2 blocks. With game-changing plays in the fourth quarter, she powered her new team past the defending champs.

John Cena and Cody Rhodes' SummerSlam contract signing

With SummerSlam a little over two weeks away, WWE is full steam ahead. And this means, this week's Friday Night SmackDown is basically a stepping stone for the upcoming Premium Live Event. From the Frost Bank Center in San Antonio, Texas, the July 18 edition of SmackDown was already going to be an important one, as fans already knew of John Cena and Cody Rhodes coming together to sign their SummerSlam contract. Along with these two heavyweights, fans also got to feast on some exciting match cards, so let's get in with it already.The night started with a segment starring the MFTs, who had been in a car accident. SmackDown GM Adam Pearce and a few cops are seen talking to the stable where Solo Sikoa asks Pearce to get Jacob Fatu. But soon enough, the night moves towards its first fight when Charlotte Flair is seen backstage with Alexa Bliss , where the former tells the latter that she has gotten them a shot at the WWE Women’s Tag Team Titles at SummerSlam.Charlotte Flair and Raquel Rodriguez face each other inside the ring while Alexa Bliss and Roxanne Perez are standing outside. Both women seem to have a similar standing in the game, with neither being able to gain an upper hand. Perez tries to launch a sneak attack, but Bliss is there to take care of that. Finally, just when Perez thought she could create a distraction, Bliss hits Rodriguez with one of her pompoms, and Flair uses this opportunity to roll her for a pin and win.The backstage segment with the MFTs starts again, and the cops take Jacob Fatu with them in suspicion of the accident earlier. Things then turn to Carmelo Hayes and Damian Priest, who, ""Earlier Today,"" we're seen having a confrontation before a fight is announced between them.Carmelo Hayes started with a right hand into Damian Priest’s back even before the bell rang, but Priest was not one to take it quietly. He retaliated with a big foot and the tone of the night was set. At the end, Priest slams Hayes face-first into the announce desk, and just as he was about to go for an Old School, Alistair Black shows up and trips Priest.The MFTs are seen taking to the ring after the alleged car accident, where Solo Sikoa lays it on thick, blaming Jacob Fatu for what went down. But out of nowhere, Jimmy Uso and Jacob Fatu pop out from a police car, and everyone gets to know that Fatu had been cleared of all suspicion because of security footage. Fatu is inside the ring soon enough, and with Uso sneaking behind the MFTs, all hell breaks loose. Pearce is seen calling the cops when things get out of hand, and Sikoa is seen being led out by the cops for staging the earlier car crash. And the Steel Cage match between Solo Sikoa and Jacob Fatu at SummerSlam is also officially announced.Possibly for the shortest match of the night, Stephanie Vaquer faces Alba Fyre of the Secret Hervice with Piper Niven watching. They go after each other from the very beginning, but Vaquer is definitely the one with the upper hand here and soon goes for the Devil’s Kiss, and then a package backbreaker. Though Fyre manages to give the slip the first time, the second time becomes too much, and Vaquer manages to get the three count after pinning her.Piper Niven, of course, comes after Vaquer, but the latter shoves her off. And though Niven tries to go after her again, Fyre stops her. Meanwhile, the Wyatt Sicks are seen trolling the Street Profits after their loss last week, right before a four-way tag team match is set to take center stage.To determine the #1 contenders for the WWE Tag Team Championship, #DIY's Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa, Rey Fenix & Andrade tag team, Fraxiom's Nathan Frazer and Axiom, and Motor City Machine Guns' Chris Sabin & Alex Shelley take to the ring. MCMG and Fraxiom are at it when #DIY jumps them. This brings Andrade and Rey Fenix into the mix as well. It's chaos inside the ring, but what else can we expect? Lastly, fans see Andrade hitting Ciampa with The Message and taking the win.Finally, the moment everyone had been waiting for. Adam Pearce brings Cody Rhodes to the stage who right away signs the SummerSlam contract. He then asks the crowd, ""What do you want to talk about?” He talks to the crowd for a while before Pearce brings John Cena out. And it's not what anyone is expecting. Cena tells everyone that Hollywood has been draining these days, and so, he won't be at SummerSlam. Everyone is shocked, but Cena goes on to say that maybe they can have the rematch later, but he won't be signing the contract now, as he does not intend to show up at the New Jersey event. He goes to walk away, and that's when things take a turn.Fans see Rhodes charging up the ramp and attacking Cena from behind. It's a mess, as both men try to gain the edge over the other. Cena tries to use his championship belt as a weapon, but Rhodes is not having that and grabs it from his opponent, smashing Cena with it. He then climbs the top rope and does a Frog Splash, driving Cena through the announcer's table. He then grabs a pen and forces Cena to sign the SummerSlam contract. The night ends with Cody Rhodes holding on to the Undisputed Champion belt.Also Read: WWE SummerSlam 2025 just got bloodier as Solo Sikoa v Jacob Fatu 2.0 moves inside the Steel Cage",This week's Friday Night SmackDown is basically a stepping stone for the upcoming Premium Live Event.

After being AWOL for nearly two months, a death hoax regarding Eugenia Cooney is circling all around the internet. Cooney has always been a matter of concern to her fans regarding her underweight condition along with her alleged eating disorder, anorexia.But what has prompted the social media as it is buzzing right now about the death of this popular TikTok and YouTube celebrity?

But this creator has always been in the pages of controversy.Her recent death hoax has been stirred by a summary from Meta AI. This summary claimed that on July 12, 2025, Cooney passed away at the age of 30. This dispute got even more heated up by another claim from one of Cooney’s alleged neighbors, named Trixie, who stated that she lived around the block from her and saw an ambulance and a body bag carrying a body.These two claims were the real reason the death hoax of Cooney is trending all around the internet.For some seconds, these claims might sound very real.

Penguins rebuild raises questions about Sidney Crosby’s future

Crosby linked to Canadiens and Avalanche amid escalating NHL trade rumors



Sidney Crosby remains committed to Penguins amid intensifying trade rumors

Sidney Crosby has been the face of the Pittsburgh Penguins for nearly two decades, but the latest NHL trade rumors suggest a potential shift. Despite being under contract through the 2026-27 season, the future of the 37-year-old Penguins captain is once again under heavy speculation—especially with the Montreal Canadiens and Colorado Avalanche emerging as serious contenders.Crosby’s longtime teammate Evgeni Malkin is entering the final year of his four-year, $24.4 million deal, and insiders believe the Penguins may not extend him. This has fueled speculation that a full rebuild is on the horizon. In 2022, Malkin hinted at the transition, saying, “If this team wants new blood… we will see.” Sidney Crosby trade rumors 2025 intensify as Penguins’ rebuild talk grows, sparking speculation around his possible midseason departure.Greg Wyshynski of ESPN recently added fuel to the fire by predicting that if the Penguins struggle early in the 2025-26 season, Crosby could be moved before the trade deadline. Although Crosby has not publicly expressed a desire to leave, his silence hasn’t stopped NHL insiders and fans from speculating.According to NHL insider Frank Seravalli, multiple teams have shown interest in acquiring Crosby, but two names keep resurfacing—the Montreal Canadiens and the Colorado Avalanche.The Avalanche connection stems from Crosby’s close friendship with Nathan MacKinnon. The duo recently led Team Canada to victory at the 4 Nations Face-Off, reigniting buzz about reuniting in Colorado. However, MacKinnon recently shut down rumors of Crosby joining the Avs, calling it fake news.Meanwhile, the Montreal Canadiens appear to be a more realistic destination. Crosby, a Nova Scotia native, grew up idolizing the Habs, and multiple analysts—including Wyshynski and Nick Kypreos—believe Montreal could be his final NHL stop after the 2026 Winter Olympics.Also Read: Sidney Crosby trade rumors explode as NHL legend helps friend join Blue Jackets, fueling Penguins exit buzz Despite the mounting trade buzz, Crosby has remained focused on the ice.

Pro wrestling and veteran WWE legend Marcus “Buff” Bagwell has recently undergone an above-the-knee amputation at the age of 55 after years of medical struggles. The wrestling figure had to go through this surgical process due to complications from a 2020 car crash.Following years of surgeries, infections, and a long, exhausting recovery, his fight has now taken a deeply challenging turn. The 55-year-old wrestling veteran shared the update with his fans and revealed the news on his official YouTube channel, confirming that the surgery will take place on July 19, 2025. WWE legend Buff Bagwell’s above-knee leg amputation and his health struggles began following a horrific car crash in August 2020 in Cobb County, Georgia, which left him with multiple injuries, including a shattered kneecap. Taking to his YouTube account, Bagwell shared, ""Today we are 12 hours away from being at the hospital. We have to be there at 7:45 tomorrow morning for an above-the-knee amputation. This is the result of a five-year battle trying to save my leg. ""Looking back at the incident, it all happened during an accident that occurred in Cobb County, Georgia, when Bagwell lost control of his Chevrolet Tahoe while navigating a turn.According to the Cobb County Police Department, the vehicle crossed a median, smashed through a metal fence, and collided with a restroom at a transit bus station.Bagwell suffered life-threatening injuries and was quickly taken to the hospital. This was not the first time he had encountered danger. His body had endured significant physical tolls, as evidenced by his involvement in a serious car crash in 2012.Despite undergoing almost 30 surgeries, Bagwell kept suffering from recurring infections, chronic pain, and mobility problems. After continuous medical struggles, the doctors finally declared that his leg had only a 20% chance of being saved, and even in that case, it would likely be immobile, resulting in the above-knee leg amputation.In a recent statement, veteran WWE wrestler Shawn Stasiak revealed that Bagwell had done “everything he could to avoid this outcome,” but the long battle had reached a point where there was no other option. Marcus Buff Bagwell has devoted the professional wrestling arena for almost 34 years. He has devoted his life to being a professional wrestler.

Leafs, Kings, and Rangers are preparing—but Connor McDavid might call the shots

Oilers front office makes re-signing their mission

As NHL teams gear up for a potential free-agent frenzy in 2026, the league’s eyes are firmly locked on one name—Connor McDavid. With his current contract set to expire on July 1, 2026, rumors are flying about whether the Edmonton Oilers captain could bolt for a big-market franchise like the Toronto Maple Leafs, New York Rangers, or Los Angeles Kings. But according to longtime Oilers broadcaster Gene Principe, the signs point toward McDavid staying right where he is.During a July 15 appearance on the Spittin’ Chiclets podcast, Gene Principe confidently pushed back on the speculation. When asked how likely he thought it was that Connor McDavid would stay, Principe said, “You know, I’m really confident.” He attributed that to the emotional toll McDavid has endured after two straight Stanley Cup Final losses to the Florida Panthers.“I just saw a guy who’s given everything and then some,” Principe said, describing McDavid as “gutted” following the 2025 loss. Even in that heartbreak, McDavid didn’t lash out or hint at leaving. Instead, he told fans, “Stick with us, because for all of us, it’s going to pay off.” That, said Principe, “was kind of better than ‘I love you.’”There’s no denying other franchises are circling. Toronto Maple Leafs, in particular, has made no secret of its dream pairing of Auston Matthews and McDavid. As NHL insider Chris Johnston put it, “If McDavid becomes a free agent, of course, the Leafs (would try to sign him)—they’ve been nuts.”But McDavid holds all the leverage. As Johnston added, “He’s going to pick his terms.”McDavid has made his intentions clear: “I’m not in a rush to make any decision… If I feel that there’s a good window to win here over and over again, then signing is no problem.”General Manager Stan Bowman affirmed the franchise’s commitment, declaring, “He’s the best player in the league and a no. 1 priority.” While insiders believe an eight-year extension is unlikely, shorter-term deals worth $16–18 million annually are on the table. The message from Edmonton? They’re all-in on keeping McDavid—and right now, it seems he just might be all-in on staying.Also Read: Stanley Cup shame sparks Oilers' panic move—goalie coach out as franchise refuses to face roster truth",Gene Principe says Connor McDavid’s heart is still in Edmonton.

The 20-year-old goaltender for the Anaheim Ducks could not believe his ears when he heard–“Hey, we’ve got our top six guys and you’re one of them.” Damian Clara received this beyond-belief news on June 16. The netminder only talked about it with Dan Arritt of NHL Network on July 18. He innocently told Arritt, “I didn’t even know there was a thing. I just got a call, and I was like–Okay, wow. What’s that?” Clara hails from Brunico, Italy, and he’s going to represent his home country at the 2026 Olympics!“It’s a big honor. Really happy to get the trust. I will do my best to go there and hopefully help the team. It’s our goal, and we’ll see what happens,” Clara told Arritt. When Arritt asked him how he viewed competing in the Olympics? The netminder said, “Just see it as a challenge. There’s nothing to lose. Exciting opportunity–as I’m still in the development. And it’s a great thing for Italian hockey to invite some of the best players in the world into our rink and obviously match up with our team. ”Arritt asked him if he used his stature to intimidate the players on the rink. The 6-foot-6, 214-pounder goalie said, “Sometimes, I open up and I play too aggressive and make life hard for myself.That’s something else I’ve learned–just use what’s there the best way possible, and I think there’s still some steps I can take to accomplish that and get more out of it.”Apart from the goggle-eyed goalie, six others will play in the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026–Rasmus Dahlin(defenseman and captain for the Buffalo Sabres), Gabriel Landeskog(left winger and captain for the Colorado Avalanche), Lucas Raymond(ice hockey winger for Detroit Red Wings), Adrian Kempe(ice hockey player for the Los Angeles Kings), Victor Hedman(defenseman and captain for Tampa Bay Lightning), and William Nylander(ice hockey forward for Toronto Maple Leafs)–but they would all be representing Sweden.","Six players from the NHL will compete in the 2026 Olympic Winter Games.

NEW DELHI: Two standout performances from India’s narrow 22-run defeat against England in the third Test at Lord’s have earned a permanent place in cricketing history - with Jasprit Bumrah and KL Rahul ’s names now inscribed on the iconic Lord’s Honours Board.The Board, which records all five-wicket hauls and centuries at the 'Home of Cricket', saw fresh additions in the form of Bumrah’s 5/74 in England’s first innings and Rahul’s gritty 100 off 177 balls in India's reply - both efforts pivotal in keeping the contest alive till the final day.Despite India's eventual loss, their standout performers found reason to celebrate.Lord’s Cricket Ground's official handle shared a video montage on Friday, revealing the updated board. Titled “Two new additions to the Away Dressing Room Honours Board,” the clip featured visuals of Bumrah and Rahul during their milestones followed by a reveal of their names immortalised in Lord's folklore.India had earlier dismissed England for 387, courtesy of Bumrah’s brilliance with the ball, and Rahul’s dogged ton ensured the visitors matched that total. However, a second-innings collapse during a chase of 193 saw India fall short despite Ravindra Jadeja ’s valiant unbeaten 61.The series now stands at 2-1 in England’s favour after India’s 336-run win in the second Test at Birmingham and the opening loss in Leeds. The fourth Test in Manchester, starting July 23, gives India a chance to bounce back.For now, though, Bumrah and Rahul’s achievements at Lord’s - etched in gold - offer a proud moment in an otherwise gut-wrenching result.",Jasprit Bumrah and KL Rahul's names inscribed on Lord's Honours Board.

Poll Who do you think will win the series? India England

In a striking assessment of the ongoing India-England Test series, former England captains Nasser Hussain and Michael Atherton have likened the drama and intensity of the five-match contest to the legendary 2005 Ashes. With England leading 2-1 and two Tests remaining, both cricket pundits believe the series is brewing into something special - tense, dramatic, and unforgettable.Speaking on the Sky Sports Cricket Podcast, Hussain didn’t mince words: ""You have got it as the next 2005 Ashes."" The tight finish at Lord’s - where India fell short by 22 runs despite Ravindra Jadeja ’s heroics and Mohammed Siraj ’s gritty resistance - brought back vivid memories of the Edgbaston epic from 2005. Then, too, the Test ended with heartbreak for the visitors and a quiet show of sportsmanship between battered warriors.""Well, actually, there was a similarity that struck me when Siraj went down on his haunches at the end,"" said Atherton, recalling how English players, including Zak Crawley and Joe Root, came over to console Siraj. ""There were some similarities,"" he added, pointing to that emotional Flintoff-Lee moment at Edgbaston two decades ago.Hussain emphasised the ""bit of niggle"" and ""evenly matched"" nature of the sides, saying: ""There’s now a bit of tension in the series and still all to play for.""One such flashpoint came during Day 3 at Lord’s when Crawley and Duckett tried to slow things down before stumps. India responded aggressively, leading to an on-field flare-up that saw Siraj shouting in Duckett’s face the next day after dismissing him.""I think Siraj is a better cricketer when he is fired up,"" Hussain noted. ""You would love to have Siraj in your side. I didn’t think he should have been fined. He went close to the line - but didn’t cross it. It’s a game of emotion. You don’t need 22 robots.""Atherton, meanwhile, believes this bubbling tension will only enrich the remainder of the series. ""That’s the beauty of a five-Test match series - it allows subplots, personal rivalries and animosities to develop. They wouldn’t be forgetting what was said on the field.""With matches at Old Trafford and The Oval still to come, the battle is far from over - but one thing is certain: the fire is well and truly lit.",Former England captains Nasser Hussain and Michael Atherton have likened the India-England Test series to the legendary 2005 Ashes.

In a Vitality Blast match at Trent Bridge, Nottinghamshire defeated Lancashire despite early struggles. The game stood out for exceptional performances from 17-year-old Farhan Ahmed , who took a hat-trick and five wickets, and Tom Moores, who scored a match-winning 75 runs. Lancashire were bowled out for 126, but Notts initially struggled before securing victory with 28 balls remaining.The young sensation Farhan Ahmed has continued his remarkable rise in cricket. Last season, he became Britain's youngest player to take ten wickets in a first-class match. His five-wicket haul, including a hat-trick in the final three balls, proved crucial in restricting Lancashire.Lancashire's innings started promisingly with 38 runs from 19 balls. However, their momentum quickly faded as Notts' spinners, including Farhan and Patterson-White, struck early. The batting side tumbled to 53 for 5 in eight overs. A 62-run partnership between Matty Hurst (36) and Chris Green (29) provided some resistance but wasn't enough.Notts' chase got off to a shaky start. They were reeling at 14 for 4 after Tom Hartley's double strike in the second over.Then came Tom Moores' game-changing innings. He smashed 75 off 42 balls, forming a crucial 81-run partnership with Lyndon James (20). Despite Moores' run-out near the end, Notts reached their target of 127 with plenty of balls to spare.The victory was bittersweet for Nottinghamshire. Their poor net run rate meant they missed the quarter-finals for the third time in four seasons.

Hogg's comments come in the wake of England being penalised two ICC World Test Championship points for falling short of the over-rate requirement during their thrilling 22-run victory over India in the third Test at Lord's.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Hogg said that slow over-rates are justifiable if the match maintains drama and intent. “When things are not going as fast, the slow over-rates there, it is okay as long as there is tension in the game. We want that tension. We want the players' character showing,” he said.He added pointedly, “As long as it has got the tension, slow over-rate is good - because that is quality cricket.”Hogg, who played 145 matches for Australia, argued that in English conditions, conserving bowler energy is strategic, especially when the ball softens. “It is a bit of cat and mouse... when the batters are in control, bowlers wait for that defensive moment to strike back and rush them.That's where the game ebbs and flows,” he noted.Reflecting on India's defeat at Lord's, Hogg pointed to one pivotal moment. “India lost that match because of one moment. Pant getting run out trying to get Rahul on strike for his hundred, and then Rahul gets out after celebrating. Two wickets in ten balls after a 140-run stand. That was the turning point.”The five-match series now stands at 2-1 in England's favour, with the fourth Test in Manchester beginning July 23.",Former Australian spinner Brad Hogg defends slow over-rates in Test cricket.

“Put your name on it”: Van Noy’s unfiltered message

Roquan Smith’s game tape tells another story

Players are no longer silent—and fans are listening

Baltimore Ravens linebacker Kyle Van Noy has ignited a wave of reaction after calling out an anonymous NFL assistant coach who questioned Roquan Smith’s conditioning in a new preseason report by ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler. The unnamed coach claimed Smith “looked sluggish,” triggering immediate backlash from the Ravens' locker room and sparking a viral moment that now defines the team’s defensive mindset heading into the 2025 NFL season.The moment Van Noy came across the criticism, he didn’t wait for a press conference. Instead, he fired back online with an explosive post that left no doubt about where he stood. “Hey J Fowler tell that NFL assistant to EAD cuz Agent Zero is on some s**t and you are a B for hiding! Put your name on it!!!” he wrote on X, taking direct aim at both the coach and the outlet reporting it. Within minutes, quarterback Lamar Jackson retweeted the post, showing support without adding a word—because in Baltimore, sometimes silence says it all.Fans flooded social media, applauding the show of unity. Many questioned why someone would attack Smith anonymously, especially given his leadership and consistent performance. Some even called for ESPN to stop publishing quotes that aren’t attributed, arguing it feeds baseless preseason narratives.While one anonymous voice questioned Smith’s form, his 2024 stats delivered a different narrative. Smith ended last season with 154 total tackles, including 81 solo, along with 1.5 sacks, one forced fumble, one fumble recovery, and an interception.He also defended four passes and led the Ravens’ defense with his trademark sideline-to-sideline range and leadership.Smith, who was traded to Baltimore from Chicago in 2022, signed a five-year, $100 million deal in January 2023, making him the highest-paid inside linebacker in NFL history. With $60 million guaranteed, he’s under contract through 2027, though there is an out after the upcoming season. However, sources close to the franchise say there’s no plan to move on from the All-Pro linebacker, who remains a vocal captain and tone-setter in the locker room.Anonymous critiques are nothing new in NFL preseason chatter, but Van Noy’s response has amplified a growing pushback from current players. As platforms like X give athletes the power to respond instantly, fans are leaning more into player voices than vague scouting reports.Smith hasn’t responded publicly yet—but frankly, he doesn’t need to. His numbers speak volumes, and his teammates have already made one thing clear: in Baltimore, loyalty is louder than any unnamed quote.Also read: Kyle Juszczyk’s wife Kristin reimagines Sydney Sweeney’s runway corset in a head-turning ESPYs look","Baltimore Ravens linebacker Kyle Van Noy called out an anonymous NFL assistant coach who questioned Roquan Smith’s conditioning in a new preseason report.

Travis Scott, who was seen this year at the Elimination Chamber PLE alongside John Cena, The Rock, and was heavily criticized for brutally attacking Cody Rhodes during the promotion, has landed himself in jeopardy. His future is at stake in WWE , and backstage updates suggest that the US rapper turned wrestler has found himself in serious commitment concerns with the company, related to his trainings and appearances.Travis Scott was last seen on WrestleMania 41, where he helped John Cena defeat Cody Rhodes to win the Undisputed WWE Championship. But since then, the rap star has gone completely off the WWE radar, and now we have some clarity on why Scott has been absent from the wrestling scene. Travis Scott has noticeably faded from WWE programming. The US rapper who was aspiring to feature on WWE and was seeking training from the wrestling experts was not seen after his stint on WrestleMania 41 . However, recent insights have shed light on a backstage update behind this sudden disappearance.According to a new update from Dave Meltzer in the, WWE had originally been considering a major celebrity tag team match involving Scott and Cena, stemming from their angle at Elimination Chamber and WrestleMania.But those plans quietly fell apart as WWE talent and staff have grown frustrated with Scott’s ""half-in, half-out"" approach to the promotion.Reporting on the same, he said, “He doesn’t like to commit to anything. He goes half-in and tries other projects at the same time. And since he’s a personal client of Ari, everyone tried to accommodate until it just became too much to deal with.”In addition to this, backstage reports have stated that Scott has skipped several key training sessions, including preparation for a planned appearance at WWE Money in the Bank . His lack of discipline reportedly became a headache for those trying to incorporate him into John Cena’s retirement storyline.What was expected to be an exciting celebrity-wrestling crossover now seems to be merely a one-time cameo appearance. Since WrestleMania 41, WWE hasn't acknowledged Scott, and the feeling behind the scenes is that they might have hit a breaking point.After Travis Scott’s commitment concerns, fans are quite upset with the fact that the dream tag team match between John Cena and Scott is not happening currently as originally planned earlier.The highly anticipated bout, which was rumored to feature the duo at WWE SummerSlam again after WrestleMania 41, has now been scrapped following backstage frustrations over Scott’s lack of consistency and missed training sessions. However, it will be interesting to see if WWE gives Travis Scott an opportunity before John Cena retires.","Travis Scott was last seen on WrestleMania 41, where he helped John Cena defeat Cody Rhodes to win the Undisputed WWE Championship. backstage updates suggest that the US rapper turned wrestler has found himself in serious commitment concerns with the company.

The Cleveland Browns' off-season isn't being kind to the former Buckeyes RB, Quinshon Judkins, whatsoever. The No. 36 overall pick in April's draft had a dream run with the Ohio State Buckeyes last year, lifting the trophy with the team as a token of tribute to his 1,030 yards and 12 touchdowns for the team. But destiny took a U-turn all of a sudden when his alleged ex-girlfriend chose to expose him for an altercation, which led to a painful beating afterward. The police are still probing into the matter after taking the defendant into custody for just a day with a $2500 penalty. Yes, Judkins is free now, but the question it begs: can he really switch into a mental state to lace up his shoes for the practice in the NFL pre-season rush?The answer is no. The young running back is now busy sitting and deep-diving with his lawyer to study the legal clauses ahead of the final hearing. The gridiron took a back seat at this point and quite reasonably so. But it's more of his team's decision than his own. Yes, you heard it right. According to Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland.com, the athlete was told not to report on the training camp, Berea this Friday, the 18th of July. While every other rookie on the team kick-started their training in the Browns Jersey, Judkins remains unsigned.But the team is in no hurry, allowing him the time to fight his off-field battle well at South Florida.The whole mishap emerged after the couple reached the Fort Lauderdale International Airport where he allegedly hit her girl following a heated verbal confrontation. A 911 call revealed that when the woman tried to make her point during the argument, Judkins lost his cool and hit her on the face, particularly, in '' while sitting on their rented SUV.That was not it. The RB struck the lady multiple times in the left arm and thigh. The recorded audio call unleashed more trauma behind the glass-clean image of a high-profile football icon, where the victim said she still has bruises and marks on her body, strongly validating the harm.Now, for those who worries about the status of Judkin's potential starting job, it's safe to prepare your heart for bigger consequences. Even if Judkins escapes the court's liabilities, he has the NFL's own disciplinary action awaiting him down the road. Usually, as applied to any domestic violence charges, it's supposed to be a proper personal conduct violation charge with a six-game suspension.However, both the NFL and the Browns don't want to dig into the matter further as of now, restricting their responses to being. But for the worst-case scenario, NFL commissioner Rodger Goodell can put Quinshon on the Commissioner's Exempt List, leaving his career in a dark hole of uncertainty. But that's only possible if and when the athlete signs his rookie contract.","Quinshon Judkins, a rookie running back for the Cleveland Browns, is facing domestic violence charges.

Yet, Nicholas is carving out his destiny. Taking the longer route, Nicholas is already committed to playing NCAA hockey at Quinnipiac University beginning in the 2026–27 season.Such a commitment shows maturity and patience, and this maturity and patience will certainly serve him in the OHL draft.

Jaroslav Halak announces retirement after 17 remarkable NHL seasons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/jaroslav-halak-announces-retirement-after-17-remarkable-nhl-seasons/articleshow/122770925.cms,"Jaroslav Halak announces retirement after 17 remarkable NHL seasons (Image Via Twitter)

Career of Jaroslav Halak in NHL: A matter of consistency and going clutch



Timeline and trophy awards that cemented the law-changing legacy of Jaroslav Halak



A career that saw Jaroslav Halak present 20 years of elite-level goaltending across the NHL came to an end at age 40. His goaltending presence would float quietly on the ice in times of great pressure, with an incredible career résumé filled with clutch postseason performances. With 295 wins, 53 shutouts, and two William Jennings Trophies to his name, Halak is considered one of the most reliable, resilient, and international goalies to ever grace both NHL arenas and international-level tournaments.A march from a ninth-round selection in the 2003 NHL Draft to then being a stable presence amongst seven NHL franchises is a story that certainly brings inspiration. Over his 17 seasons, Jaroslav Halak played a total of 581 regular-season games (555 starts) and posted career averages of 2.50 goals-against and a save percentage of .915. How he could incorporate himself into different systems, be it Montreal, St. Louis, Washington, New York (Islanders and Rangers), Boston, or Vancouver, was a testament to his mental fortitude and technical steadiness in the net.Halak’s zenith in the National Hockey League came in the 2010 Stanley Cup Playoffs by defending the Montreal Canadiens to their second year in the Eastern Conference Final after being named an eighth seed.In the first round, Halak turned aside 131 of 134 shots over the last three games to enable the elimination of the heavily favored Washington Capitals. That playoff run is still one of the brightest moments in recent Canadiens history, showcasing Halak’s ability to change the game when it really matters.Halak won the William Jennings Trophy twice, first with the Blues in 2011-12 and then with the Bruins in 2019-20, for being part of the defensive units that allowed the fewest goals in the respective seasons. Among Europe-born NHL goalies, he is 12th all-time in games played and 14th in wins, which is a testimony to being a top-tier goaltender for a very long time, going through all phases of an ever-evolving league.In Stanley Cup Playoff games, 39, Halak had a .919 save percentage and a 2.48 GAA, statistics that are most worthy and telling of his readiness under pressure. In between back-to-back Winter Olympic Games in 2010 and 2014, he also represented Slovakia. He was a key player in Team Europe finishing as runners-up in the 2016 World Cup of Hockey.Also Read: Nicholas Sykora signs with Owen Sound Attack to venture beyond his father’s shadow With the retirement of Jaroslav Halak, one more era of glorified goaltending comes to an end. Though never very flashy, the never-faltering presence of this goaltender had commanded respect from his teammates, opponents, and fans. After hanging up his pads, Halak will be remembered for quiet brilliance and steely resolve, as well as being his nation's pride in hockey.","Jaroslav Halak announces retirement after 17 remarkable NHL seasons.

Bradley Beal’s Silent Farewell Goes Viral

Two Years of Missed Opportunities

Moving On: Clippers, Cap Space, and a Clean Slate

Why the NBA Couldn’t Stop Laughing

Closing Thoughts: A Superteam That Never Was

Whenjoined the Phoenix Suns in 2023, expectations soared. Fans and analysts imagined a Western Conference powerhouse built around Beal, Kevin Durant , and Devin Booker. But two years later, following a string of injuries and unmet expectations, Beal’s silent departure from Phoenix—with nothing more than a peace sign emoji on Instagram—set off a storm of amused and bewildered reactions across the NBA landscape.No farewell statement. No highlights. Just a single “✌️” emoji. That was the extent of Bradley Beal’s goodbye to the Suns, and it was enough to send social media into a frenzy. The NBA community, especially his fellow players, responded with a mix of laughter, sarcasm, and understanding:- Kevin Durant, now with the Houston Rockets, replied with a simple “😂”.- Bam Adebayo followed suit with the same laughing emoji.- Trae Young joked: “Not the deuces ✌️😂”- Tyus Jones added: “Aye man 🤣🤣”- Andre Drummond summed up the sentiment with: “Lmaooo your sick”The minimalism struck a chord—one emoji carried more weight than any formal statement. Bradley Beal ’s time in Phoenix never lived up to the hype. Hampered by injuries, he averaged just over 50 games per season. Despite the combined star power of Beal, Durant, and Booker, the Suns failed to win a single playoff game during Beal’s tenure.Their 2025 campaign ended in a first-round sweep, followed by an outright playoff miss.Statistically, Bradley Beal produced solid numbers—around 17 points per game on efficient shooting—but critics argued his performances lacked meaningful impact. The much-hyped trio couldn’t generate consistent offense together, and the chemistry never materialized on the court.Following a mutual buyout, Beal is now set to join the Los Angeles Clippers , giving him a fresh opportunity to reestablish himself in a new system. He also reportedly gave up $14 million in the process. Meanwhile, Phoenix clears significant salary cap space and pivots toward building around Devin Booker.Yet, for many, it’s not Beal’s next step that’s memorable—it’s how he exited. That single emoji symbolized the disbanding of what was once envisioned as the NBA’s next great superteam.The responses from Durant, Adebayo, and others weren’t just jokes—they reflected the deeper culture of the league:- A sense of fraternity: NBA players often poke fun at one another in ways only insiders understand.- Shared frustration: Many stars, including Durant, had experienced the same disappointing ride in Phoenix.- An unspoken message: Beal’s peace sign may have said more than words could—about the chaos, the exit, and maybe even relief.Bradley Beal’s exit from Phoenix won’t be remembered for a teary tribute or a media circus. It will be remembered for its quiet finality and the wave of reactions it triggered. His time in the desert will likely go down as one of the NBA’s biggest “what-ifs”—but at least, in true NBA fashion, it left the league entertained.Also read: Joel Embiid Addresses Leadership Criticism in the Highly Demanding NBA League: ""You Can’t Expect Me to Be Part of That Again"" Now headed to the Clippers, Bradley Beal turns the page.
