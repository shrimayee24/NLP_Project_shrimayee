Vancouver Canucks sign Pierre-Olivier Joseph to shore up defense corps

“Pierre-Olivier has good speed and mobility and will add to our depth on the back end,”

“His addition gives us a player with some solid NHL and pro hockey experience, he is comfortable playing both sides, and he won a world championship with Tyler Myers in 2023. We look forward to getting him here to start working with our group.”

From draft pick to international gold

The Vancouver Canucks have kept up the rebuilding process on their roster by signing defenseman Pierre-Olivier Joseph to a one-year contract worth $775,000. The signing was announced by general manager Patrik Allvin on Wednesday. Joseph adds more depth and experience to the Canucks' blue line with proven NHL ability and success internationally. He played split last season between the Pittsburgh Penguins and St. Louis Blues.Pierre-Olivier Joseph played 47 NHL games last year, picking up three assists and spending an average of 15 minutes per game on the ice. He stands at 6-foot-2 and 185 pounds and is 26 years old, bringing size and agility that Canucks officials think will complement their existing defensive crew.Allvin said in a release.Joseph's versatility makes him capable of playing in Vancouver or for the Abbotsford Canucks in the AHL when necessary.His arrival is forecasted to bring additional competition for roster spots coming into training camp.Originally drafted 23rd overall by the Arizona Coyotes in the 2017 NHL Draft, Joseph was traded to the Penguins in 2019 as part of a trade that saw Phil Kessel go to Arizona. In Pittsburgh, he became a steady depth defenseman before ultimately making his NHL debut for the team.Last year, Joseph signed with St. Louis to play together with his brother Mathieu, but he was traded back to Pittsburgh in December for future considerations. Altogether, he's appeared in 194 NHL games, scoring eight goals and 40 points.Joseph also gained international accolades when he assisted Team Canada in capturing gold at the 2023 IIHF World Championship, recording one goal and a plus-6 rating in 10 games.In the addition of Pierre-Olivier Joseph, the Canucks have gotten a reliable, adaptive defenseman who adds both NHL exposure and a winning background. His signing is likely to bolster the blue line as the Canucks look to improve the roster for next season.Also Read: K’Andre Miller signs $60 million deal, credits his mom for making his NHL dream possible","Vancouver Canucks sign Pierre-Olivier Joseph to a one-year contract worth $775,000.

Taylor Swift distances from Blake and It Ends With Us while finding peace with Travis Kelce

What was once one of Hollywood’s most adored friendships has reportedly come to a dramatic end. Taylor Swift and Blake Lively, once inseparable on vacations, red carpets, and NFL game nights, are no longer on speaking terms. According to a revealing Page Six report, the collapse of their relationship stems from a $400 million lawsuit involving Blake’s It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni — and Swift is now leaning on her boyfriend, NFL star Travis Kelce, for support during the fallout.The legal dispute exposed private texts where Blake Lively referred to Taylor Swift and Ryan Reynolds as her “dragons,” comparing herself to Khaleesi from Game of Thrones. This comment — made in the context of her legal dispute — reportedly outraged Swift, who felt blindsided and misrepresented.“She will forever be furious at how Blake quite clearly was using her for clout and leverage in her dealings with Justin,” a source close to Swift told Page Six. “She really hates that Blake would even think like that, let alone write the things she did in that text.”While Taylor Swift had previously licensed her song My Tears Ricochet for the film’s soundtrack, she never promoted the movie — even before the legal mess surfaced.Sources say that wasn’t by accident. Swift reportedly saw the friendship as casual and low-pressure, not one where she’d be expected to get involved in someone else's legal fight.“The truth is, the text wasn’t even accurate,” the insider said. “That’s not the kind of friendship they ever had—Taylor would never think of herself as Blake’s ‘dragon.’”Amid the public drama, insiders say Swift has found grounding and reassurance in her romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. The couple, who’ve become one of pop culture’s most watched pairs, have been spending more time together during Swift’s Eras Tour breaks.“Travis has been a calming presence for Taylor,” one entertainment insider shared privately. “She’s leaned on him throughout this entire fallout with Blake Lively. He gets the pressure she’s under and doesn’t ask anything from her except honesty and time.”“They were baking pals, travel pals, home decor pals… and to be totally honest, billionaire pals,” the source added. “It was nice to be with someone else who ‘gets it’.”Now, with the friendship fractured and the legal dust settling, Swift is said to be moving forward with a smaller, tighter circle — one where trust isn’t just assumed, but earned. “Taylor buries hatchets but keeps maps of where she put them,” the source added, quoting Swift’s lyric from End Game.Also Read: “Pleading for forgiveness”:Blake Lively refuses to let Taylor Swift cut her off as Travis Kelce quietly sides with the his lady love For Taylor Swift, who’s finally reclaimed the rights to her early music and continues to dominate stadiums worldwide, it’s a new chapter — one where Travis Kelce, not Blake Lively, plays the leading role beside her.The couple's high-profile romance has become a cultural phenomenon, blending pop superstardom with NFL fame, and giving fans a real-life fairytale to follow.","Taylor Swift and Blake Lively are no longer friends, according to a new report.

Kevin Durant and Steve Nash expose growing disadvantages for small guards in today’s evolving NBA



The Kevin Durant Interview (Part 1) | LeBron James & Steve Nash | MIND THE GAME

The NBA has seen a dramatic shift in how teams value certain skill sets, and the modern game may be pushing small guards toward the margins. In a candid discussion on the Mind the Game podcast, Kevin Durant and Hall of Famer Steve Nash discussed the challenges that undersized guards face in today's positionless, switch-heavy league. With playoff success depending more and more on defensive versatility, even talented scorers under 6'2"" are struggling to stay impactful on the floor.Kevin Durant, now with the Houston Rockets, didn’t hold back when speaking on how the league is evolving. “I don't know if the 6'2 and under guard is at a premium no more as a starter,” he said. “Maybe as a backup.” His comments reflect a growing sentiment among players and analysts. In today’s scenario, the game is too focused on size and defense for smaller guards to thrive without exceptional tools.Steve Nash agreed but pointed out that only certain body types and playing styles now make the cut. “It’s that either Donovan Mitchell, Jrue Holiday 6'3, Lou Dort,” Nash said. “Or it’s, nah, you got to be (bigger).”Durant expanded on that thought with a harsh truth. “You can't get picked on on defense,” he said.“That's the thing. Because we're playing such a pick on game that they will literally — if you can't guard — they will bring you up every play. If you're 6'0, 6'1 and you're not a bulldog like Davion Mitchell, Jrue Holiday on the defensive side or you're not an offensive flat out savant like Kyrie (Irving) where you can score on dudes that's 7'0 easily in ISO, then I just can't see it. ”Their conversation shifted to Cleveland Cavaliers guard Darius Garland, a skilled offensive player who was often targeted on defense during the postseason. Nash praised Garland’s game, saying, “He's an amazing basketball player. We don't talk about him as this amazing (player) because of the era. If he played in any other era, I think his value would be through the roof. He's that skilled. He's water bug. He's got every shot. He can playmake, but it’s an era where you also have to help that dude out defensively all the time.”Durant agreed with Nash’s points but added, “If you want a chance to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers, you are going at Darius Garland most the time on the defensive side. That’s not saying he's going to get scored on every time. He's just small.”Also Read: NBA analyst drops bombshell comments on LeBron James and Luka Doncic chemistry: “This is Luka’s team now” Durant used Orlando’s Paolo Banchero, a 6'10"" offensive mismatch, as an example of the type of players that exploit smaller defenders.

Giannis Antetokounmpo

The Milwaukee Bucks’ Shocking Roster Shake-Up

Giannis’ Real Reaction: No Goodbye Post

Why the Rumor Spread

The Bucks’ Perspective and Giannis’ Future

Themade a bold move by waiving, a move that immediately raised questions about the future of the franchise and the mindset of its superstar,. Amidst the social media frenzy, rumors quickly circulated that Giannis had posted a ""goodbye"" message—fueling speculation about his own future in Milwaukee. Here’s what actually happened, based on the latest credible reporting.On July 1, 2025, the Milwaukee Bucks made two headline-grabbing moves: they waived Damian Lillard—stretching the $113 million left on his contract—and signed free agent center Myles Turner to a four-year, $107 million deal. Lillard, who suffered a torn Achilles in the playoffs, was expected to miss most or all of the upcoming season, prompting Milwaukee to aggressively reshape the roster around Giannis.Despite viral claims, Giannis Antetokounmpo did not post a goodbye message to Damian Lillard or the Milwaukee Bucks. Instead, his only public reaction was a cryptic social media post expressing confusion about the team’s direction. According to multiple reports, Giannis posted, “I don't know what's going on right now,” shortly before news of Lillard’s waiving broke.This message was interpreted as surprise and perhaps frustration, but it was not a farewell or an indication that he was leaving Milwaukee.NBA insider Chris Haynes, who is well-connected with both Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo, reported that Giannis was “not pleased” with the Bucks’ decision to waive Damian Lillard. However, Haynes clarified that Giannis’ displeasure was more about the coldness and manner of the move rather than a desire to leave the team himself. Haynes stated, “He just didn’t appreciate how it was handled,” and noted that Giannis is now reassessing his future but has not made any public demands or posted a goodbye.The rumor of a “goodbye post” appears to have originated from misinterpretations and the emotional tone of Giannis Antetokounmpo’s actual post. The Milwaukee Bucks’ decision to waive Lillard—who was brought in as Giannis’ co-star in a blockbuster 2023 trade—sparked immediate speculation about whether Giannis would follow him out the door. However, there is no evidence that Giannis has requested a trade or is preparing to leave Milwaukee at this time.Milwaukee’s front office made the move to create cap flexibility and keep the team competitive during Giannis Antetokounmpo’s prime years, especially with Damian Lillard likely sidelined for the season. ESPN’s Shams Charania reported that Giannis was on board with the acquisition of Myles Turner, and both players valued the opportunity to partner on the court. Still, the abrupt release of Lillard has added uncertainty about Giannis’ long-term commitment, with insiders noting this is “one more thing added to the equation” as he considers his future.Giannis Antetokounmpo has not shared a goodbye post following the news of Damian Lillard being waived. In fact, his only public reaction has been a cryptic message expressing confusion rather than a farewell.According to NBA insiders, Giannis is indeed frustrated by the situation, but his displeasure is directed at the process itself, not the Milwaukee Bucks organization as a whole. There are no public signs suggesting that Giannis is seeking a trade or planning to leave Milwaukee at this time.Also read: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Becomes NBA’s Highest-Paid Player with $285M Thunder Extension After Historic MVP Season As the Milwaukee Bucks prepare to move forward with a revamped roster, all attention remains on Giannis, whose next move will be pivotal in determining the franchise’s future.

Florida Panthers re-sign Marchand, Bennett and Ekblad Despite NHL free agency speculation

Bill Zito: Florida Panthers GM Talks Signing the Big 3, Free Agency, Where He’s Taking the Cup

The Florida Panthers have successfully retained Brad Marchand, Sam Bennett, and Aaron Ekblad before the 2025 NHL free agency window opened. With just $19 million in available cap space, GM Bill Zito faced serious doubts. But the Panthers managed to secure long-term deals with their core stars, though not without losing important contributors from their championship-winning roster.Despite public skepticism, GM Bill Zito stayed true to his word about spending to the NHL salary cap to keep his core intact. Brad Marchand, coming off a Conn Smythe-winning postseason, signed a six-year deal worth $5.25 million annually. Sam Bennett agreed to an $8 million AAV deal, while defenseman Aaron Ekblad committed to an eight-year extension.Marchand and Bennett were both linked to the Toronto Maple Leafs during early speculation, while reports also suggested the Boston Bruins were interested in bringing Marchand back. Ekblad was rumored to be a target for the Utah Mammoth. But all three made their intention clear—they wanted to stay in Florida.Zito downplayed his role in the deals, saying it was the players who made the choice. “It was those guys,” he told reporters.The front office's ability to retain its core sets the Panthers up to challenge for a third straight Stanley Cup.The Panthers lost two key depth players—Nico Sturm and Nate Schmidt—who played important roles in their 2025 Cup run. Sturm, a two-time Stanley Cup champion, returned to the Minnesota Wild, the team where he began his NHL career. Schmidt signed a three-year, $10.5 million contract with the Utah Mammoth after joining Florida on a one-year, $800,000 deal.Both losses hurt Florida’s depth, but the top-heavy strategy reflects a win-now mindset. The Panthers are aiming to become the first team in the salary cap era to win three straight Stanley Cups. Only the Pittsburgh Penguins (2009, 2016, 2017) and Chicago Blackhawks (2010, 2013, 2015) have won three during this period—though never in consecutive years.Also Read: Alex Delvecchio, Detroit Red Wings legend and 3-time Stanley Cup champion, dies at 93 The Panthers’ cap management, star loyalty, and proven leadership give them a real shot at history, even if depth remains a question heading into the 2025–26 season.","Florida Panthers re-sign Marchand, Bennett and Ekblad despite NHL free agency speculation.

In a dramatic turn of events in Los Angeles, an NBA analyst, John Gambadoro, has stirred the pot by claiming LeBron James is no longer the centerpiece of the Lakers. The statement comes just days after LeBron opted into his $52.6 million player option for the 2025–26 season. While fans expected this to signal yet another championship push with the purple and gold, whispers around the league suggest a power shift is underway, with Luka Doncic emerging as the new alpha in town. The analyst further teased that James does not like playing with Doncic.The moment the Los Angeles Lakers landed Luka Doncic, the direction of the franchise started to shift. And now, with LeBron entering his 23rd NBA season, that shift is becoming harder to ignore.On “The Burns and Gambo Show,” analyst John Gambadoro claimed, “LeBron does not like playing with Luka. Reeves does not like playing with Luka. Reeves does not like getting the ball with two seconds left on the shot clock. LeBron is not fond of playing with Luka. The Lakers are going to turn their attention to building around Luka, not LeBron.”Gambadoro’s claim adds weight to what has been building over time. Despite James averaging an impressive 24.4 points and 8.2 assists at age 40 last season, the organization seems less committed to a long-term future with him.ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne echoed that, noting the Lakers didn’t even sit down with James this summer to discuss an extension. “That means that it’s not in his control with the Los Angeles Lakers. That was a statement, even though they didn’t make a statement,” she said on air.That growing uncertainty hasn’t gone unnoticed. Brian Windhorst highlighted the gravity of the situation: “For the first time in 23 years, he’s not the franchise player.” The tone is clear as the Lakers are laying the groundwork for a Luka-centric team, not one centered around James.About on-court chemistry, that remains a work in progress. Luka himself recently told the Mind the Game podcast, “He’s been playing unbelievable, and I think it’s still a work in progress. You know, I think we’re getting better and better every day.” LeBron, too, praised the duo’s growth publicly. Yet the eye test and recent reports suggest the transition may not be seamless.Also Read: LeBron James once made Jayson Tatum cry, and it was not on court Of course, the Lakers are looking for a long-term future, and considering LeBron’s age, he is far from leading the franchise despite already acquiring the legendary status and playing at an elite level.","Los Angeles Lakers face power shift as NBA analyst questions LeBron James– Luka Doncic chemistry.

A Browns fan screamed “We own you” at Joe Burrow while he walked, and the video sparked outrage



“The Browns own you, bro! The Browns own you!”

NFL fans are defending Joe Burrow and calling out the Browns fan for going too far



NFL fans furious after Browns fan verbally attacks Joe Burrow in public. X

There’s rivalry, and then there’s straight-up harassment and unfortunately, Joe Burrow just experienced the second one. The Bengals superstar quarterback was out at night, minding his own business, when a Cleveland Browns fan spotted him and began heckling. Not playful trash talk. Just loud, repeated yelling.Burrow, classy as ever, didn’t even react. But the moment quickly went viral and fans across the league are calling it disgusting.The video, shared online shows Burrow walking with his security when a Browns fan starts taunting him loudly and relentlessly. It’s unclear where the incident happened, but the fan repeatedly yells,Burrow doesn’t stop, doesn’t respond, and doesn’t even look at the guy. His security team, though, makes their stance clear, telling the fan to back off.The clip has since gone viral, and while some found it amusing, the overwhelming majority of fans were shocked not just at what was said, but at where and how it was said.Trash talk between AFC North fans is nothing new but this felt different. Bengals fans rushed to Burrow’s defense online, praising his calm and blasting the fan for being obnoxious.Even some Browns fans chimed in, saying it was cringe and disrespectful. The general consensus? This isn’t sports rivalry, it’s just weird.There’s a difference between passionate fandom and crossing personal boundariesRivalries fuel the NFL. Browns vs. Bengals has always been intense, and sure Burrow hasn’t had the best win record against Cleveland. But there’s a big difference between what happens inside the stadium and what fans do on the street.Players, like anyone else, deserve privacy and peace when they’re off the clock. Harassing someone with a phone out and shouting in their face isn’t “supporting your team”, it’s just bad behavior.This moment isn’t just about one fan or one team. It’s part of a bigger problem where players get treated like public property, not people.Despite the taunting, Burrow didn’t flinch. He didn’t clap back. He didn’t escalate. He just kept walking like it didn’t even phase him.Also read - Stefon Diggs trains like a beast even while vacationing in a castle with Cardi B",Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow was harassed by a Browns fan.

Cheng Hao’s AI robot football sparks revolutionary shift in sports with historic Beijing match,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/cheng-haos-ai-robot-football-sparks-revolutionary-shift-in-sports-with-historic-beijing-match/articleshow/122206199.cms,"How Cheng Hao’s AI robots made football history in Beijing despite struggles

On Saturday June 29, 2025, history was made in Beijing, China. This was not just any ordinary football match as there were no humans involved. Four teams of AI humanoid robots were competing for the first time in a three-a-side football tournament. This competitive appearance was vital for the robots' sports capability and moreover it gave the world knowledge that sport is changing and AI is having an influence. However, things did look futuristic and moving in that direction, the match did demonstrate how far robots have to go.Booster Robotics, a tech firm run by Cheng Hao, organized an AI robotic football match in a stadium in Beijing, China. The teams were humanoid robots developed by university students. Each team controlled the robots using their own software in order for the robots to move, pass, and kick a ball.While the idea was exciting, the match had many funny moments. The robots fell down often, missed easy kicks, and even needed help standing up again. Some robots were removed from the match after failing to get back on their feet.Still, Cheng Hao saw it as a big step forward. He said, “In the future, we may arrange for robots to play football with humans.That means we must ensure the robots are completely safe.”Tsinghua University’s AI robots claim world’s first robot football championshipThe final AI robot football match was played between Tsinghua University’s THU Robotics team and China Agricultural University’s Mountain Sea team. The exciting final ended with a 5–3 victory for Tsinghua, who became the first robot football champions. A student from the winning side said, “They did really well, but the Mountain Sea team also gave us a surprise.”Subramanian Ramamoorthy , a professor at the University of Edinburgh, said that the robots were as good as the robots being demonstrated at the RoboCup competitions, and they were getting better each year.The demonstration confirmed that robots are in no position to replace human players similar to Kylian Mbappe, but getting better each game. The mix of AI, football, and robotics is now a real thing, and it’s just getting started.","Four teams of AI humanoid robots were competing for the first time in a three-a- side football tournament.

Antonio Brown hits $57,720 jackpot betting on Diddy’s charges

✅ Diddy found guilty of prostitution

❌ Not guilty of racketeering conspiracy



“Gambling with niggas lives…”

Kalshi lets you bet on real-world events but this one hit different

“Will inflation rise next month?”



“Will Joe Biden drop out before the election?”



Or apparently, “Will Diddy be convicted of prostitution?”



Antonio Brown has seen a lot in his time from NFL chaos to rap game madness but even he had to pause when a $124 bet on Diddy’s verdict turned into a $57,000 payout. And the reason? Someone literally parlayed Diddy’s federal charges like they were a fantasy football lineup.

He might just run up an entire down payment off Diddy’s downfall.AB’s captionhas people debating whether it was self-aware, dark humor, or just another chaotic Antonio Brown moment.While some are disturbed at the idea of betting on real-life legal outcomes, others are just amazed that AB made more in one night than he did in some of his final NFL games.If you haven’t heard of Kalshi yet, it’s a U.S.-regulated prediction market where you can legally wager on yes/no outcomes. Think:And while it’s all technically legal, this latest viral win is raising eyebrows especially since the stakes involved actual victims, alleged abuse, and federal charges.From stadiums to scandals, Antonio Brown’s life has never been predictable. But this might be the most on-brand plot twist yet: Betting on one of the most high-profile trials in pop culture and winning.

Aiono wants Puka confirmed as the baby’s father, but custody only on her terms



She’s also asking for financial help before the baby even arrives



Pregnancy-related costs







Childbirth expenses







Her legal fees for the case



No public response from Nacua but this could get messier fast



Just when Rams breakout star Puka Nacua should be gearing up for his second NFL season, his name is making headlines for something off the field. His longtime girlfriend, Hallie Aiono, has filed a legal petition in Los Angeles County not just to establish paternity, but to secure full custody of their unborn child and financial support for everything from pregnancy to lawyers. The court documents, obtained by TMZ Sports, paint a pretty serious picture and they suggest this situation might be far more tense than fans expected.According to the legal filing, Hallie Aiono is asking the court to formally confirm that Nacua is the father of her baby, who is expected to arrive later this year. The two have reportedly been in a long-term relationship, but it doesn’t look like they’re on the same page anymore.In the documents, Aiono is requesting full physical custody of the child once born. That means she wants the baby to live with her full-time, with Nacua granted visitation rights only. However, she’s open to joint legal custody, meaning they’d both have a say in decisions like education or medical care.Aiono’s petition isn’t just about custody. She’s also asking the court to order Puka to cover a range of expenses, including:That’s a major ask and indicates that the two may already be in disagreement over financial support even before the baby is born.As of now, Puka Nacua hasn’t publicly commented on the legal filing. It’s unclear if he’ll contest paternity or agree to the terms Aiono’s asking for. Either way, a court may order a paternity test after the child is born if there’s any dispute.The situation comes just as Nacua is set to return to Rams camp and build on his explosive rookie season, which saw him become one of the league’s most exciting young receivers. But now, he’s also stepping into a potentially high-profile legal fight that could follow him into the season.From record-setting receptions to a surprise playoff push with the Rams, Nacua was one of last season’s biggest breakout stars. But with court proceedings underway and his ex-partner seeking full control of parenting and finances, his off-field situation may dominate headlines in the months ahead.Also read - Diddy facing 20 years but NFL’s Dez Bryant says Cassie “was no victim”","Puka Nacua's longtime girlfriend Hallie Aiono has filed a legal petition in Los Angeles County.

Ottawa Senators plan for future with Jordan Spence while Los Angeles Kings’ Brian Dumoulin and Cody Ceci deals spark questions

Los Angeles Kings’ signings of Brian Dumoulin and Cody Ceci raise eyebrows in NHL free agency

Also Read:

The 2025 NHL offseason is serving up plenty of drama. Few moves have fueled more debate than the contrasting strategies of the Ottawa Senators and Los Angeles Kings. Ottawa’s Day 2 NHL Draft trade for 24-year-old defenseman Jordan Spence looks like a forward-thinking bet on youth and value. Meanwhile, the Kings made headlines for all the wrong reasons—spending big on aging, pricier blueliners whose best days might be behind them. It’s a clash of philosophies with the potential to reshape both franchises for years.The trade was finalized during the second day of the 2025 NHL Draft and NHL free agency period in Las Vegas, sending Jordan Spence to Ottawa in exchange for a 2025 third-round pick and a 2026 sixth-round pick.Jordan Spence, a Japanese Canadian defenseman born in Australia, is coming off a career-best NHL season with 28 points and an impressive +23 rating. He’s entering the final year of his restricted free-agent deal at just $1.5 million—a bargain price for a 24-year-old on the rise.""Spence was arguably the most underappreciated defenseman on the Kings roster,"" an NHL scout said on the Draft floor in Las Vegas. ""He does so many little things well, but he wasn't getting the credit he deserved in LA.""Ottawa’s approach this summer has been measured and calculated. Their biggest free-agent move so far has been signing veteran center Lars Eller to a one-year, $1.25 million deal—solid, but hardly splashy. It’s clear they see Spence as a long-term investment who can grow with their emerging core.The real fireworks came when NHL free agency opened in early July 2025, and the Kings turned heads with a spending spree many see as risky. Los Angeles signed Brian Dumoulin to a three-year, $12 million deal ($4 million AAV) and former Senator Cody Ceci to a four-year, $18 million contract ($4.5 million AAV).“Ceci’s contract was the biggest surprise of free agency so far,” said a league executive at the Kings’ practice facility in El Segundo. “You’re talking about paying more for two older players while letting a younger, cheaper option walk.”Dumoulin, now 33, had a rough end to the regular season after being traded to New Jersey at the deadline, though he redeemed himself somewhat by averaging over 29 minutes per game in the playoffs. Ceci, 31, was often a liability in Dallas’ 2025 playoff run.Adding to their aggressive moves, the Kings also brought in former Senators goalie Anton Forsberg on a two-year deal at $2.25 million per season—a move viewed as solid depth, but not exactly headline-grabbing.While the Senators quietly locked in a promising young defenseman for minimal cost, the Kings bet big on experience and name recognition. It’s a gamble that could define the trajectory of both teams. If Spence thrives in Ottawa and cements himself as a top-pairing defenseman while Brian Dumoulin and Cody Ceci struggle to live up to their hefty salaries, Los Angeles might look back on this offseason as the mistake that set them back for years.","The 2025 NHL offseason is serving up plenty of drama.

Niilopekka Muhonen becomes part of Medicine Hat Tigers ' roster



The Dallas Stars have formally signed Finnish defenseman Niilopekka Muhonen to a three-year entry-level agreement, another strong move for the talented 19-year-old blueliner. The contract will come into effect in the 2025–26 NHL season, giving Niilopekka Muhonen one extra year of improvement before coming into the Stars' system permanently.Kuopio, Finland native Niilopekka Muhonen signed with the Medicine Hat Tigers of the Western Hockey League (WHL) for his first season in North America in 2024–25, where he quickly made a name for himself with his steady play in defense and excellent adjustability. A fifth-round (158th overall) selection by Dallas in the 2024 NHL Draft, Niilopekka Muhonen was one of two imports on the roster of the Medicine Hat Tigers.In 60 regular-season games, Niilopekka Muhonen accumulated 17 points (4g, 13a) and posted a +20 plus/minus rating. He also had 45 penalty minutes, all while playing significant minutes against strong competition. His performance translated into the postseason as well, where he added three points (1g, 2a) in 18 games and was a member of the Medicine Hat team that claimed the Ed Chynoweth Cup as WHL champions.The Tigers advanced to the Memorial Cup final, where they fell short of the London Knights, but Muhonen's play on the blue line late in the season did not go unnoticed by NHL scouts and front offices across the league.At 6-5, 215 pounds, Muhonen is a combination of size, agility, and calm. A pressure-best defense decision-maker with his calmness, he was utilized in all roles by the Tigers' coaching staff, such as penalty situations and end-of-game defenseman situations. His reach and body positioning allow him to play well in front of top-flight forwards, and his passing and stickhandling portend a future offense to be built.Muhonen's signing is a nod to the Stars' dedication to creating a dynamic and agile defensive core of the future. It's anticipated that he will go back to junior hockey or to Europe or the AHL for the 2025–26 season, but Dallas sees him as part of their blue line depth in the long term.Also read: Alex Delvecchio, Detroit Red Wings legend and 3-time Stanley Cup champion, dies at 93 With his entry-level contract now signed, Muhonen will proceed with development with professional expectations firmly in view.

Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry and his wife Ayesha Curry had partnered with former U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama last year to help change how kids and parents choose sweetened beverages. A year later, Ayesha has now shared her thoughts on their brand of healthy drinks — created to satisfy kids’ cravings for taste without making parents worry about harmful health effects. Using her culinary experience, Ayesha has helped in creating the beverage that is not just tasty but also nutritious.Ayesha Curry recently took to her Instagram Stories to offer a glimpse of her reaction to the child-friendly beverage.

In March, she took on the role of Chief Garden Officer in the company.Ayesha and Stephen are parents to four children — daughters Riley (12) and Ryan (9), and sons Canon (6) and Caius (1) — which explains their strong interest in promoting children’s health and nutrition.

I wanted to do something that wasn’t draining, something that would excite me and keep me motivated.”Savannah James even discussed the actual reason behind the existence of Reframe. She revealed""I’ve spent years obsessed with finding products that truly worked. I’d stalk the aisles of Sephora, always in search of formulas that delivered real results but also felt luxurious and reflected who I am. Time and again, I came up short.I didn’t see myself represented in the brands on the shelves—not in the science, the imagery, or the intention.""According to Savannah James, she always had a thing for beauty and wellness. While bringing her dream into existence with respect to having a good skincare line, she recalled—""I remember having a conversation with my team very early on. I get it; this is a highly saturated market I’m stepping into. But we were intentional about how we wanted to differentiate our brand from everything that already exists. The clinical trials and studies we backed our products with, as well as the unique formulations, textures, and colors. Every detail mattered.”For Savannah James, the prime focus behind coming up with a luxury skincare line, Reframe, is related to addressing the basic concerns, including skin inflammation, hyperpigmentation, dark spots, and acne.Also Read: LeBron James’ wife Savannah James gets real about the extreme outside pressure of being a mom of today's youth","NBA icon LeBron James’ wife, Savannah James, opened up on her strange obsession with skincare and good makeup.

Has Bronny James really retired from the NBA?

Bronny James’ NBA stint



Bronny James on LeBron James’ retirement plans



LeBron James kept the media and his fans speculating about his retirement for months after the Los Angeles Lakers’ exit from the playoffs. But what has come as a complete shock is a social media post by NBA Central which claims it’s his son and teammate Bronny James who has announced his retirement. While the trolls celebrated the announcement, it doesn’t seem as it looks. Bronny is still very much a part of the NBA, but there is a slight twist to it.A post shared on NBA Central’s X account on Tuesday read: “BREAKING: Bronny James announces his retirement from the NBA.” This was followed by several harsh comments as many celebrated his retirement.But the aspiring footballer will probably be more encouraged to prove his best as he now gears up to represent the Los Angeles Lakers in Summer League in order to be better prepared to play alongside his father once again. The NBA Summer League mostly sees the participation of rookies and other young players to polish them further before they get a chance to play alongside the legends and veterans of the NBA in the regular season.Bronny James, 20, fulfilled his father LeBron James’ dream of playing together on the same team when he was picked by the Los Angeles Lakers as the No. 55 overall pick in the second round of the Draft. He had played just one year of college basketball for the USC Trojans.The development sparked an ongoing nepotism debate, as NBA fans compared his rookie beginnings to his father’s towering list of achievements.Bronny played 27 games in his debut season with the Los Angeles Lakers. He has an average of 2.3 points, 0.8 assists, and 0.7 rebounds per game in the NBA regular season.Last month, Bronny expressed his desire to watch LeBron continue to play basketball. On being asked if his father should play more matches, Bronny told Fox Sports, “Yeah for sure. However long he can come back for, it’s always a pleasure being around him. He’s locked in. The stuff he does for his body and the preparation and stuff like that, I want to take full advantage of it.”Also Read: LeBron James once made Jayson Tatum cry, and it was not on court LeBron James is yet to decide his future, but it remains to be seen if the father-son duo will unite once again on the court.","Bronny James, 20, played 27 games in his debut season with the Los Angeles Lakers.

49ers legend Brent Jones compares Pearsall to breakout star Puka Nacua



Ricky Pearsall is entering his second NFL season with high expectations. After being shot before his rookie year, the San Francisco 49ers wide receiver returned to finish strong with 210 yards and 2 touchdowns in his final two games. With Deebo Samuel traded and Brandon Aiyuk injured, Pearsall is set for a breakout in the 2025 NFL season.Ricky Pearsall’s road to the NFL was anything but ordinary. Shot before his rookie year, the first-round pick didn’t just recover, he made a strong late-season impact. In the final two games of 2024, Pearsall totaled 14 receptions for 210 yards and two touchdowns, showcasing his route-running, athleticism, and chemistry with quarterback Brock Purdy.That late surge caught the attention of former 49ers tight end Brent Jones. Jones missed his own rookie season in 1986 after a head-on collision with a drunk driver. Later released by the Steelers, he rebuilt his career in San Francisco and became a three-time Super Bowl champion. Jones knows what it takes to overcome trauma and succeed at the highest level. He sees the same resilience in Pearsall.In a recent interview with Guy Haberman, Jones said, “To actually see it click for him really kind of made it special at the end of the year.I look for him to be a big contributor this year. What a special young man to fight back from all of that.”What makes Pearsall's situation even more interesting is the roster turnover in San Francisco. Deebo Samuel is now in Washington, and Brandon Aiyuk is expected to miss the start of the 2025 season. That leaves Pearsall with a clear path to a starting role and plenty of targets.Brent Jones went a step further in his praise, saying, “Do not sleep on this guy. Maybe not the amount of catches, but I think he’s gonna be Puka Nacua-like at some point.”Nacua was the breakout wide receiver of 2023, posting a rookie-record 105 receptions for 1,486 yards and six touchdowns with the Rams. While Pearsall may not hit those exact numbers, the opportunity is real and the trust from the coaching staff is growing.Also Read: Tyreek Hill wants another raise despite $90M deal—Dolphins, McDaniel reportedly considering trade The 49ers will be relying on their young receiver to make plays early in the season.

NetEase Games adds a much requested feature in Season 3 of Marvel Rivals

Season 3 in Marvel Rivals is knocking at the door as the upcoming seasonal update is going to be dropped on July 11, 2025. This season will mark the beginning of the new seasonal format, where every season will run for two months, with the mid-season refresh planned to be released in the second month.As announced earlier, Marvel Rivals will now launch a hero each month, and we have already got our new characters for the upcoming two months - Phoenix (Jean Grey) and Blade. Along with new maps like Klynter and new team-up abilities, fans are already hyped up about Season 3. However, the most exciting addition of this season is yet to be explored.The official YouTube channel of Marvel Rivals has recently hosted the Volumer 7 od Dev Vision, where the Creative Director Guanguyn Chen and other development team members of the game talked about the upcoming season, The Abyss Awakens. In this video, they confirmed that there will be a new feature called mix and match skins MVP animations, which fans have been wanting for a long time.Previously, players used to don the same skin in order to execute the MVP animation, the one which comes clubbed with that particular skin bundle. However, that same skin might not be suitable to wear in the whole match.Still, for the sake of using that animation, players had to equip that skin as that specific MVP animation can’t be used with any other skin.However, as the new feature is confirmed, players don’t need to worry anymore. After the arrival of Season 3, players will be able to wear any skin they want, and still, they will be able to execute the MVP animation associated with any skin bundle.However, it seems the MVP animation will use the same skin as its bundle and the gameplay skin will be different. The final frame of the MVP animation is actually pre-rendered, and combining MVP animations with new skins would be a tough job for the developers.But if it comes out the other way around, then this feature will open a new dimension of customization in Marvel Rivals as it will make MVP animations of other skins more appealing, which actually don’t have any. A detailed overview about this feature is yet to be disclosed by the developers, so the functionality of this feature is still unknown.","Season 3 in Marvel Rivals is knocking at the door as the upcoming seasonal update is going to be dropped on July 11, 2025.

From NHL hopefuls to legal uncertainty

Once rising names in Canadian hockey, five young players—Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube, Carter Hart, Cal Foote, and Alex Formenton—now find their professional careers in limbo as they await a court verdict on July 24, stemming from sexual assault charges tied to a 2018 incident. What began as a celebration of a gold-medal victory at the World Junior Championships has spiraled into a national scandal that shook Hockey Canada and left the futures of these athletes hanging by a thread.The allegations relate to a night in June 2018, following a Hockey Canada gala in London, Ontario. According to investigators, the incident occurred in a hotel room, involving a then-unnamed woman and several players. Now, all five accused have pleaded not guilty, but their absence from NHL rosters and legal entanglements suggest the damage is already done.Michael McLeod, once a top draft pick and playoff hero for the New Jersey Devils, took an indefinite leave in January 2024 and was charged shortly thereafter. He now plays in Russia’s KHL as he awaits his fate.Dillon Dube had a breakout moment with the Calgary Flames during the 2020 playoffs, but after being charged in early 2024, he too left the NHL.He signed with Dinamo Minsk in Belarus, his mental health cited as the reason for his initial leave of absence.Carter Hart, who had once been dubbed Canada’s next elite goaltender, now sits without an NHL contract. His career came to an abrupt stop in 2023, shortly before charges were filed. Once backed by the Philadelphia Flyers, he now finds himself as an unrestricted free agent.Both Cal Foote and Alex Formenton sought refuge in European leagues, their North American careers stalled by the court case. Formenton, notably, left hockey entirely in 2025, taking up construction work in his hometown—a stark contrast to the NHL dream he once lived.Also Read: When will the Hockey Canada sexual assault verdict be delivered?

Poll Do you agree with India's decision to rest Jasprit Bumrah for the second Test? Yes, it's a smart move for workload management. No, we need him to win this match.

India’s team selection for the second Test at Edgbaston has triggered widespread criticism, with fans and cricket greats questioning several bold calls. Among the decisions that stood out, the most notable was the call to rest pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah.Despite India trailing 0-1 in the five-match series and needing a result to stay alive, Bumrah was rested for workload management. While skipper Shubman Gill explained at the toss that Bumrah was being preserved for the third Test at Lord’s, the decision didn’t sit well with many, including South African pace legend Dale Steyn.In a sarcastic post on X, Steyn compared Bumrah’s absence to leaving out football icon Cristiano Ronaldo. “So Portugal have the best striker in the world in Ronaldo and they chose not to play him. That’s madness. That’s like India having Bumrah and choosing not to play, umm, him… wait, oh, no, what! shit I’m confused 😵‍💫,” Steyn wrote.Bumrah, currently the No.1 ranked Test bowler, played a key role in India’s earlier wins this year and has consistently been their go-to match-winner in overseas conditions. His absence at Edgbaston, a venue traditionally a venue that offers seam movement has raised eyebrows, especially when India opted for three all-rounders and just five specialist batters.Adding to the scrutiny was the decision to drop Sai Sudharsan after his debut and to bench Kuldeep Yadav, who has been in top form. Former India head coach Ravi Shastri also expressed concerns before the match, hinting that the team’s combinations were moving away from specialist strength.With England having already seized momentum after their Leeds win, India’s choice with Bumrah may well define the trajectory of this series. And if they backfire, the selection panel will face even more heat.",India's team selection for the second Test at Edgbaston has triggered widespread criticism. Fans and cricket greats questioned several bold calls. The most notable was the call to rest pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah.

'We were close to getting him': Woakes admits Gill’s control as India reach 310/5 at Edgbaston

BIRMINGHAM: The boundary dimensions here at Edgbaston were an intriguing topic of discussion when play began on Day One of the second Test. The boundary cushions looked distinctly asymmetrical and regulars at the ground said they had not seen such short boundaries before in Test matches at this venue.The boundary fence on the side of the scoreboard, which is wide long-off for a righthanded batter from the pavilion end, looked particularly jarring. There were jokes made in hushed tones, with some even wondering if the playing area left unused could have been used for a kids’ game!The longest boundary was 65 metres, which happens to be the cow-corner hit. The straight boundaries are around 60 metres. India, interestingly, had announced well in advance that they would go in with two spinners, which begs the question if the boundaries were brought in to enable England’s batters to go for the big hits.One obvious vulnerability in the English batting has been their inability to take on spin, with the Indian camp publicly stating that spin could contain England’s batting lineup.India picked Washington Sundar ahead of Kuldeep Yadav for this Test because of his ability to bowl tight lines for longer periods of time, besides his better batting abilities down the order.However, the comparatively shorter boundaries are sure to encourage the uninhibited home batters to go big against India’s spinners.It must be recalled that during the 2019 World Cup, the Indian team was left unhappy when one side of the boundary here was left unusually short for their match against England. The English batters nullified India’s in-form spinners Kuldeep and Chahal.ICC regulations say boundary sizes can range from 59m to 90m. It is believed that certain parts of the boundary were brought in by at least 5-10m. There should also be a distance of at least nine feet between the ropes and advertising boards, but one side looked 20-25 feet away from the boards!","The boundary cushions at Edgbaston looked distinctly asymmetrical.

Brief scores: Texas Super Kings 87/2 in 5 overs

beat Washington Freedom 44/4 in 5 overs

by 43 runs

Texas Super Kings secured a convincing 43-run victory over Washington Freedom in a rain-affected Major League Cricket match at Lauderhill, propelling them into the second position on the points table. The match was reduced to five overs per side due to rain, with TSK posting 87/2 before restricting Freedom to just 44/4, largely thanks to Donovan Ferreira's explosive unbeaten innings of 37 off 9 balls and Shubham Ranjane's unbeaten 39 in 14 balls.Marcus Stoinis took charge as captain for TSK in the absence of Faf du Plessis, who was sidelined with a minor injury. Stoinis opened the batting with Daryl Mitchell but departed early, edging behind in the first over with the team managing only five runs.Shubham Ranjane provided momentum to the innings by hitting two sixes. However, Mitchell's struggle with timing led to him being retired out at the end of the third over, with TSK's score at 34/1.The strategic decision to retire Mitchell proved crucial as TSK dominated the final two overs. The partnership between Ferreira and Ranjane yielded 53 runs off just 12 deliveries, with the US player contributing two fours and a six in the penultimate over.Ferreira showcased exceptional batting prowess in the final over against Mitchell Owen, smashing four consecutive sixes to reach an unbeaten 37 off just 9 deliveries. This performance helped TSK post 87/2, the second-highest total in a five-over format game.Washington Freedom's chase began promisingly with Rachin Ravindra hitting a four and a six. However, the momentum shifted dramatically when Nandre Burger dismissed both Ravindra and Glenn Maxwell in consecutive deliveries.Akeal Hosein's impressive over, which started with a six but included five consecutive dot balls and a wicket, further derailed Freedom's chase. The combined bowling efforts of Noor Ahmed and Hosein in the final overs restricted Freedom to just 44/4.The victory has significant implications for the tournament standings, with the top three teams - San Francisco Unicorns, Texas Super Kings and Washington Freedom - now tied on 12 points each, with two games remaining for each team.(Shubham Ranjane 39*, Donovan Ferreira 37*)(Nandre Burger 2/12)- Match reduced to 5 overs per side due to rain","Texas Super Kings beat Washington Freedom by 43 runs in Major League Cricket match at Lauderhill.

However, there is speculation that suggests thecould reunite Anthony Davis with this familiar face and his former 40-year-old teammate.According to Bleacher Report’s Greg Swartz, the Mavericks have a realistic path to acquiring James this summer without dismantling their core.Swartz outlines a potential deal where Dallas sends a package of role players and a future draft pick to Los Angeles:- Players Dallas could trade:- Daniel Gafford- P.J. Washington- Naji Marshall- Caleb Martin- Compensation:- Unprotected 2029 first-round pick""Financially, this trade can work for Dallas without having to give up any of their core players,"" Swartz noted. "" The Lakers could really use this influx of frontcourt talent to complement Doncic and Austin Reaves."" (H/t: Sporting News)- Reunites Davis and James, who won a title together in 2020.- Adds championship experience alongside rising star Cooper Flagg.- Keeps the team in title contention after their 2024 Finals run.- Gains younger, versatile pieces to build around Doncic.- Secures future draft capital.- Moves an aging star while maintaining competitiveness. LeBron James and Anthony Davis spent nearly six seasons together in Los Angeles, forming one of the league’s most dominant duos. Their 2020 bubble championship remains a highlight, but injuries and roster changes prevented further success.""James has stated on his Mind the Game podcast what a great situation Flagg is going into with veterans all around and getting to play for Jason Kidd,"" Swartz mentioned. A move to Dallas would allow James to play under Kidd—his former Lakers assistant—while joining forces with Davis, Kyrie Irving, and Flagg.While the trade is feasible, concerns remain:- Age and injuries: James is 40, and Davis has struggled with durability.- Chemistry: Integrating multiple stars isn’t always seamless.Still, Swartz believes the Mavericks offer an appealing setup: ""What makes Dallas a more desirable spot for James is the addition of Flagg, who raises this team's ceiling immensely.""A LeBron-to-Dallas trade would be a dramatic twist, but it aligns with both teams’ goals.

EXCLUSIVE | David Gower on Shubman Gill, Jasprit Bumrah and India's England tour

India's rising batting stars Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal lit up Edgbaston on Day 1 of the second Test against England - and their efforts drew a flood of praise from some of cricket's biggest names, led by Sachin Tendulkar Yuvraj Singh and Irfan Pathan.The duo's commanding display helped India recover from early jolts to finish 310/5 at stumps, with Gill remaining unbeaten on 114 and Jaiswal striking a fluent 87 off 107 balls.Tendulkar took to X to laud the young guns, highlighting their contrasting yet complementary styles.“@ybj_19 set the tone from ball one. He was positive, fearless and smartly aggressive. @ShubmanGill was cool as ever, calm under pressure, solid in defence and in total control. Classy knocks from both. Well played, boys!” the batting legend wrote.Gill, who now has back-to-back hundreds as India's new Test captain, also earned plaudits from Mohammad Kaif, who hailed his emergence at the coveted No. 4 spot.“Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli and now Shubman Gill... India is always blessed to have a solid world-class batsman at No. 4. May this continue forever,” Kaif posted.Yuvraj Singh, who has long mentored Gill, was equally effusive.“When responsibility calls, some rise and some soar! @ShubmanGill just became one of the rare few to score consecutive hundreds as Test captain! A calm head, a bold bat and a hunger to lead by example,” he wrote.Former opener Wasim Jaffer praised Gill's poise under pressure. “Being India's number 4 and Test captain comes with a different pressure altogether. Really good to see it has not affected his batting one bit, in fact it's elevated it,” Jaffer wrote.All-rounder Irfan Pathan, meanwhile, underlined the duo's role in shaping India's Test future.“I have no doubt in my mind two batters from this young Indian team will take test team forward. YASHASVI JAISWAL & SHUBMAN GILL,” he posted.Despite minor setbacks - KL Rahul and debutant Nitish Reddy falling cheaply - India's commanding partnership between Gill and Ravindra Jadeja (41*) ensured the team closed the day on top, with the skipper once again leading from the front.","Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal both scored hundreds on Day 1 of the second Test against England.

On Day 3 at Wimbledon , Carlos Alcaraz ended Oliver Tarvet’s dream run by defeating the British amateur in straight sets, advancing to the third round.Defending champion Alcaraz took just two hours and 17 minutes to overcome World No. 733 Tarvet, who showcased glimpses of his rising talent and thrilled the passionate crowd with flashes of brilliance.Alcaraz has now won 20 matches in a row, a streak that includes titles at the Rome Masters, the French Open, and Queen’s Club.He aims to become only the fifth man in the Open Era to secure at least three consecutive Wimbledon titles, joining Bjorn Borg, Pete Sampras, Roger Federer, and seven-time champion Novak Djokovic.Over on the women's side, Aryna Sabalenka bucked the trend of early shockers, defeating 48th-ranked Marie Bouzkova 7-6 (7/4), 6-4 in a fiercely contested, hard-hitting match.The Belarusian, who faced tough losses in both the Australian Open and French Open finals this year, impressed with 41 winners during the 95-minute encounter.“Honestly, it’s really sad to see so many top players losing, but you’ve got to focus on your own game,” said the three-time Grand Slam champion. “I hope there won’t be any more upsets in this tournament, if you know what I mean!”Even before Day 3 of this year's Wimbledon began, 23 of 46 seeds had exited the tournament.By the time the curfew was imposed, another eight were headed for the exit door. But none bigger than fourth seed Jasmine Paolini.Paolini, beaten by Barbora Krejcikova in last year's Wimbledon final, suffered a 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 defeat against Russian world number 62 Kamilla Rakhimova on Court 3.12th seed Frances Tiafoe was the latest leading men's singles player to suffer the agony of an early defeat, going down 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-5 against British world number 61 Cameron Norrie.Britain's Emma Raducanu played some of her best tennis since her 2021 US Open victory, convincingly defeating 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 6-3, 6-3 to advance to the third round.Playing in front of a lively Centre Court crowd, Raducanu was left surprised by her own level as she outplayed the Czech.“That was one of the best matches I’ve played in a long time,” Raducanu said. “I turned around a point that I think is probably the best point I’ve ever played, so that was pretty crazy. I think the crowd was really into it.”However, she may need to elevate her game even further in her next encounter. With four of the five top women's seeds already knocked out, Raducanu’s next opponent will be the only remaining top seed — No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka.“Yeah, I guess there’s no pressure at all on me in the next round,” Raducanu said with a laugh during the on-court interview.British tennis players had already created history at Wimbledon 2025. A record number had entered the main draw, a record number progressed from the first round and the hunt for the next Andy Murray continued with a record number of men making it into the Round of 64.Seven men including fourth seed Jack Draper, Dan Evans, Jack Pinnington Jones and amateur Oliver Tarvet all made it into this year's second round at Wimbledon -- Britain's best tally at any Slam since 1997.Andy Murray had ended Britain's wait for a men's Wimbledon champion in 2013 - a wait that had gone on for 77 years or since Fred Perry's title in 1936. The next wait could be shorter thanks to Draper.The 23-year-old has been keen to keep expectations low although he says British tennis is currently ""in a good spot"", partly due to Murray's influence.""Andy has had a huge effect on a lot of the younger generation, watching his success over the years, major success on the big stage.""It's really exciting what we're going to have in the next 10 years.... It's cool to be a part of that,"" said the winner of Indian Wells Masters 1000 title this week.Draper's next round at Wimbledon is against former Wimbledon finalist and 2014 US Open winner Marin Cilic.Priyanka Chopra and husband Nick Jonas, John Cena, Olivia Rodrigo and Dave Grohl were some of the big names in the Wimbledon Royal Box on Wednesday.“It's so special in the Royal Box to have those kind of people in there. It definitely adds a bit of pressure, I guess, if you look up and you kind of recognize (them),” Raducanu said. “That’s why I try and stay with my eyes on the court as much as possible. Only after, you kind of look up and take it all in, if they’re still there.”The Royal Box seats are by invitation only, and there was quite a list of celebrities on hand for Day 3.“I was trying not to look today,” Sabalenka said about the boldfaced names, explaining that she might be distracted while competing. “I was just trying to focus on my game. Later on, I’m going to open the social media (and ask), ‘OK, who was there?’”","Carlos Alcaraz ended Oliver Tarvet’s dream run by defeating the British amateur in straight sets, advancing to the third round.
