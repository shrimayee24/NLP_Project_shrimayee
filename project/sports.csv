Iyer had a chance for a comeback, but his disappointing performance in the ongoing Duleep Trophy, where he scored only 104 runs in four innings, has further diminished his prospects.The rise of young talents like Sarfaraz Khan and Dhruv Jurel, who impressed during the series against England earlier this year, has pushed Iyer down the pecking order. BCCI official has expressed doubts about Iyer's place in the current Test team, citing concerns over his shot selection during the Duleep Trophy.""At the moment, there's no room for Shreyas to be in the Test team. Who will he replace? Besides, his shot selection has been a concern in Duleep, especially yesterday (Sunday),"" the official told Telegraph.""He (Iyer) was well set and then suddenly played such a shot (off left-arm spinner Shams Mulani). When you are set and then batting on a flat deck, you need to make the best use of that opportunity,"" the official added.Another board official hinted that Iyer will continue playing in the domestic circuit and suggested his inclusion in the five-match Test tour of Australia later this year is unlikely.However, the official also mentioned the possibility of Iyer participating in the Irani Cup and the Bangladesh T20I series, depending on his performance and availability.The official emphasized the need for Iyer to regain form while acknowledging his past achievements, particularly his batting during last year's ODI World Cup.""Now, if he doesn't fire in Irani too, he still has the Ranji Trophy to get runs. It wasn't too many days ago when he was batting so well in last year's ODI World Cup. He suffered an injury too, which needs to be considered. Also, with still one round left in Duleep, you never know he might score a hundred. He needs to regain form. Most likely he won't go to Australia for his problems against the short ball, but one can't just ignore his runs at home,"" the official added.","India's star batsman Shreyas Iyer is currently not in contention for a spot in the Test cricket team.

Cricket holds a special place in the hearts of millions across India, with fans passionately following every move of their favorite cricketers. Legends like Sachin Tendulkar , Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and Virat Kohli enjoy massive fanbases, with their fame reaching almost mythical proportions within the country. However, this intense recognition doesn't always extend beyond India's borders, as a recent viral video highlights.A video recently surfaced on Instagram that caught the attention of cricket enthusiasts.The clip, shot in a foreign country, features a host stopping random passersby, asking them if they know who Virat Kohli is or if they've even heard of cricket. Much to the shock of Indian fans, the responses were overwhelmingly negative.In the video, the host begins by asking two men, ""Do you know who Virat Kohli is?"" Both men, without hesitation, admit they have no idea who the cricket star is. The host then turns to a woman and poses the same question, ""Have you heard of Virat Kohli?"" Initially confused, she too confirms that she’s unfamiliar with the name.The video continues as the host approaches more people, asking the same questions. Each time, the answer remains the same—none of the individuals interviewed had ever heard of Virat Kohli or cricket. This highlights the stark difference in the sport's popularity within India and globally. While Kohli is revered as a cricketing superstar in his homeland, cricket remains a relatively niche sport in many other parts of the world, where other sports like soccer or basketball dominate.Since being posted, the video has garnered over 1.6 million views on Instagram and sparked a flood of reactions. Thousands of users have liked, shared, and commented on the post, expressing everything from surprise to amusement.One user quipped, ""If you ask about Ronaldo, they'll know,"" referring to the global fame of football icons like Cristiano Ronaldo, whose recognition transcends borders. Another user called Virat Kohli ""the king"" in the comments, showcasing the immense pride Indian fans take in their cricket stars.A user named Suraj pointed out the obvious cultural divide, stating, ""When cricket isn’t famous worldwide, how will they know Virat Kohli?"" Another amused commenter asked, ""Brother, which country have you gone to?"" as others filled the comment section with shock emojis and disbelief.",Cricket holds a special place in the hearts of millions across India.

Colts vs. Bears: A Battle of Struggling Run Games in Week 3 Matchup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/colts-vs-bears-a-battle-of-struggling-run-games-in-week-3-matchup/articleshow/113465330.cms,"BEARS VS COLTS WEEK 3 PREVIEW || Need To Get Offense Going!!

The Indianapolis Colts haven’t done well on defense in their first two games of the 2024 NFL season. They’re having a really tough time stopping teams from running the ball. So far they've allowed 474 rushing yards, which is the most in the league. In Week 1 alone, they gave up 213 yards, and most of those were from Houston's Joe Mixon, who ran for 159 yards.Then in Week 2, things got worse. Green Bay ran for 261 yards, and Josh Jacobs picked up 151 of those, even though Malik Willis was playing as their quarterback.Also Read - How NFL Players Invest Those 261 yards are the most the Colts have allowed since Week 16 of 2012. Back then, Kansas City rushed for 352 yards. According to the NFL, defensive coordinator Gus Bradley talked about the team's problems. He admitted the players aren’t doing well, and said the coaches need to fix things. His message was clear: if they don’t ask more from the players, they’re allowing bad results.Over the last two games, Indy has had to defend the run more often than any other team. Teams have run the ball 93 times against them so far. The Colts also give up 5.1 yards per carry, which is one of the highest in the league. The defense has allowed 24 rushing first downs, another big issue. In the past 20 years, only three other teams have given up over 425 rushing yards in their first two games. Still, no team has let opponents run for 200 or more yards three weeks in a row in the last five seasons. Could the Colts be the next?Bradley tries to stay positive. According to the NFL, he admits the coaches and players share the blame.According to the NFL, linebacker E.J. Speed agrees and says they need to fix their mistakes. He highlights problems with missed tackles and wrong moves during plays. Speed says they really have to correct those on Wednesday and try to get opponents into more third-and-long situations.This Sunday, the Colts face the Chicago Bears. The Bears haven’t been good at running the ball, ranking 28th with just 155 rushing yards in two games. The game will probably be a really important test for both teams trying to turn things around.Also Read - Record Breaking Viewership of NFL","The Indianapolis Colts have given up 474 rushing yards in their first two games of the NFL season.

The build-up to the much-awaited clash is fast gaining momentum, and it has been further fueled by former India opener Aakash Chopra , who has exposed how Indian team and players are targeted on Australian tours.Sharing a story from his commentary stint during India's 2018-19 tour, Chopra not only criticised the actions but also revealed how specific portions of play from live broadcast are clipped and shared with the Australian media to bring the Indian players into disrepute.India registered a historic first ever Test series win in Australia under Virat Kohli's captaincy, and the story Chopra shared on the '2 Sloggers' podcast is from the second Test of the series in Perth.Chopra claimed that the broadcasters amplified the stump microphone to highlight a heated on-field exchange between Ishant Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja in an attempt to tarnish the image of the visiting team.Chopra was in the commentary box when the said incident happened.""They (Australian media) used to release videos. They did it in front of me when Ishant Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja had a heated exchange with each other while standing in the 30-yard circle. The broadcasters amped up the stump mic as they were abusing each other,"" Chopra said on the podcast.""They cut the clip and shared it with the press in front of me. After that, when we were talking off the field, I was like, 'What are we actually trying to achieve because it’s nothing',' the 47-year-old former opener added.Chopra went on to add that Ricky Ponting , who was present in the commentary box when this happened, first condemned what he saw but said something exactly the opposite as soon as the former Australia captain went on air.""Ricky said they are 'Making a mountain out of a molehill'.

NEW DELHI: Virender Sehwag , the explosive Indian opener who has amassed over 8,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket, is renowned for his aggressive batting style. R Ashwin , India’s ace spinner, once mentioned that Sehwag does not consider off-spinners as true bowlers.Such was Sehwag’s aura that he could be singing Hindi songs while smashing bowlers for boundaries. Bowlers like Shoaib Akhtar Brett Lee , and Dale Steyn, all ace pacers, were not spared, as even the slightest loose ball from the greatest of bowlers was sent to the boundary.Sehwag, who scored a century on his Test debut, did not initially start as an opener, but his explosive batting earned him that role. He went on to open India’s batting in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 alongside the great Sachin Tendulkar , setting the tone of the tournament with a brilliant 175 in his first innings.Sehwag shares the record for the most triple centuries in Test cricket and was close to making history. During a Test match against Sri Lanka in Mumbai, he had the chance to become the first batsman to score three triple centuries.On the first day of this match, Sehwag scored 284 runs, making it the third-highest score by a batsman in a single day of a Test match. He faced tough bowlers like Muttiah Muralitharan but remained in control.Towards the end of the day, with only 3-4 overs left, his batting partner Rahul Dravid advised him to play out the day.Sehwag recalled in an interview that Dravid told him to imagine batting through the remaining overs without losing his wicket and then coming back the next day to possibly make 300, 400, or even 500 runs.According to Sehwag, after this conversation, Dravid carefully played out the overs, taking a single only when the over was about to end so that Sehwag would face fewer balls.When the day ended, and both batters remained not out as they returned to the dressing room, Dravid told him, 'Well done, bohot badhiya. Ab kal dekh tu wapas aaega toh pura din batting karega toh tu world record bana sakta hai.'Sehwag admitted that Dravid's words filled him with optimism, and he went to his room, had dinner, and slept soundly. However, the next day, he managed to add only 9 more runs before being dismissed for 293.Sehwag later admitted that as he walked back to the dressing room, he regretted listening to Rahul Dravid.Sehwag had scored 293 runs off 254 balls, with 40 fours and 7 sixes. In the end, the world’s leading wicket-taker, Muralitharan, dismissed Sehwag with a caught-and-bowled effort. MS Dhoni went on to score a century in that match, and India posted a massive total of 726 for 9 before declaring.India went on to win the match by an innings and 24 runs.","Virender Sehwag has amassed over 8,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket.

Bangladesh have struggled to compete with India's strong batting line-ups and bowling attacks.India's batters like Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, and Rahul Dravid have often proven too strong for Bangladesh attack.While India have overwhelmingly dominated the rivalry, Bangladesh's improvement in the last decade has added more competitiveness to their encounters. Players like Shakib Al Hasan , Mushfiqur Rahim, and Tamim Iqbal have been key contributors for Bangladesh, and their presence has made these contests more engaging.Bangladesh will be on a high after their Test series victory against Pakistan, but former Indian cricketer Mohammad Kaif believes that the visitors don’t have it in them to stun the hosts.In an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com, Kaif, who played 13 Tests and 125 ODIs for India, said that the hosts are very strong in home conditions and it would be very tough for Bangladesh to throw up a surprise.On Bangladesh winning the Test series in Pakistan and their chances in India, Kaif said, ""India are very strong. Pakistan anyways are on a strong team. Bangladesh played very well in Pakistan no doubt about that but even Bangladesh know that they will have to work very hard to surprise India.""Kaif continued, ""The last time India visited Bangladesh, they lost the ODI series and Shreyas Iyer and Axar Patel batted well to save a Test, but at that time some players were missing and in home conditions with the SG ball, India would be tough to beat.""India's last Test series was at home earlier this year when they beat England 4-1 in February.“Citing the example of the England cricket team, who came to India riding high on ‘Bazball’, and even won the first Test and had thoughts of winning the series in India, even they couldn’t do that. When a team like England lost the series so easily, that proves that this Indian team is a very balanced one,"" Kaif elaborated.Turning tracks have always been the centre of attraction when it comes to Test cricket in India and this time both teams have quality spinners in their ranks.Regarding the pitches for the both Tests in Chennai and Kanpur, Kaif said, ""Both the Test matches will be played on black soil pitches having low bounce, both in Chennai and Kanpur.""Pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah is in fine form but the combination would come down to the balance between pacers and spinners in the team with workload management of the pacers in mind.On the team combination, Kaif said, ""India will definitely play three spinners in Ravichandran Ashwin Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav and two pacers in Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj. Kuldeep Yadav might play ahead of Axar Patel, it’s a tough call but Kuldeep is a genuine wicket-taker and his form recently has been very good.""If the Indian think tank lay out a turning track, it may backfire as Bangladesh also have fine spinners in their ranks like Shakib Al Hasan, Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Taijul Islam. Kaif said, ""The last time when England came, then India coach Rahul Dravid set an example that we will have sporting tracks, not tracks on which Tests can get over in one and a half days, ones that even viewers would enjoy, have enough in them for batsmen to score hundreds and bowlers to take 5 wickets. When Ravi Shastri was coach and Virat Kohli was captain and South Africa played a Test in Mohali, the match got over in 2-3 days. But Rahul Dravid and Rohit Sharma preferred decent tracks, that’s good for batting in the beginning, and has something in it for the spinners, like a proper Test pitch. Against England, India played on decent tracks and that’s good for the game and the fans, so that good cricket prevails. Even Ajaz Patel took 10 wickets against India on a turning track. So Dravid and Rohit have learnt that we have a strong squad so we won’t play on an unprepared or a turning pitch, so that the opposition batting collapses.""This will be the first Test assignment for Team India head coach Gautam Gambhir who replaced Dravid.Kaif continued, ""Gautam Gambhir will fully take the advice of Rohit Sharma as it will be his first Test series. So we have quality bowlers and quality batsmen. Bangladesh will have to work very hard and it’s not easy to beat India in India.""On India losing to Sri Lanka in the recent ODI series, Kaif said, ""In white ball cricket you don’t get the time to bounce back and even weak teams can beat strong teams. But in Test matches, you get two innings, so a surprise in a Test is rare. Upsets can happen frequently in white ball cricket, but this Indian Test team has very mature players. A player like Dhruv Jurel will have to sit out. So this Indian team is very good, even better than England. Rishabh Pant is back, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are there. This is the best Indian team and Gambhir would want that the momentum that builds here goes on till like Australia. This will be the crux of the team in Australia as well. Mohammed Shami might come in Australia in place of a spinner but there won’t be many changes. Game time for Australia starts from the Bangladesh series and players should have confidence of playing in the middle by the time they reach Down Under.""The first Test against Bangladesh starts in Chennai from Thursday and the second Test will be played in Kanpur from September 27.","India have dominated their Test rivalry against Bangladesh, winning the majority of the matches - 11 out of 13 with two ending in draws.

Gambhir emphasized that India's focus will be on playing with intent, leaving no room for complacency against a Bangladesh side that recently claimed a victory over Pakistan.Highlighting the importance of maintaining their winning ways, Gambhir remarked, ""The winning style is the best style.""He underscored the significance of India's senior players, particularly praising the spin duo of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja , who are expected to be crucial in India's strategy.""We are fortunate to have Ashwin and Jadeja fit and available,"" Gambhir said, recognizing their ability to dominate on spin-friendly pitches.As India have a deep pool of talent, Gambhir hinted that young players like Sarfaraz Khan and Dhruv Jurel may have to wait for their opportunities, indicating that experienced players KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant will continue to be pivotal in the middle order.Gambhir, who shares a history with many of the senior players in the squad from his own playing days, spoke about the strong relationships he has built with them, which he aims to carry forward in his coaching role.""I have played cricket with a lot of guys in this team. My relationship with all the senior players is good,"" Gambhir noted.Despite their dominant standing, Gambhir made it clear that India will not underestimate Bangladesh. ""We respect Bangladesh but we will play the game that a champion side does,"" he stated, emphasizing the need for India to assert their strengths throughout the series.Reflecting on the evolution of Indian cricket, Gambhir noted a shift from the historically batting-dominant approach to a more balanced focus on bowling. He credited bowlers like Jasprit Bumrah Mohammed Shami , Ashwin, and Jadeja for turning India into a formidable bowling unit.""India was a batting-obsessed nation, but Bumrah, Ashwin, Shami, and Jadeja turned it into a bowlers' game,"" Gambhir added.The coach reserved special praise for Bumrah, calling him ""the world's best fast bowler"" and recognizing his ability to change the course of a match at any stage.Addressing rumors about players prioritizing IPL over national duties, Gambhir dismissed such notions, affirming that the current team is fully committed to representing India.He also expressed confidence in India's batting, particularly against spin, highlighting the team's ability to handle any challenges posed by opposition bowlers.With Gambhir's clear focus on maintaining a champion mindset and maximizing the squad's strengths, Team India looks set to enter the Test series with a determined and focused approach, aiming to extend their winning momentum against Bangladesh.","India's head coach, Gautam Gambhir, addressed the media in Chennai ahead of the two-match Test series against Bangladesh.

CHENNAI: The monkey is never off the back. The albatross of the ICC trophy that had been hanging around the neck of Indian cricket for a decade might have been dealt with on the shores of Barbados a couple of months ago, but that doesn't mean Rohit Sharma & Co.can breathe easy.The captain has dealt with pressure for a long time now and he knows that everything will be forgotten in a hurry if a result goes wrong here and there.""I don't know how it works for other countries, but for India it is a different ballgame. If we don't win the bilateral series (against Bangladesh), we know how it works. The (negative) talk will start happening all over again. So for us, it can never be that now we have won an ICC trophy, we can relax and enjoy,"" Rohit said ahead of a practice session at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Tuesday.On Thursday, the Test series against Bangladesh will start. It is the first stop towards India's push for a place in the WTC Final .Rohit knows that he doesn't have a lot of time on his side - he is 37 now - and this may well be his last chance to win the WTC title.""For us cricketers, we've got limited time to play the game, to make an impact in the sport. So, you've got to try and do your best, try and possibly win everything you can, whatever is in front of you,"" the skipper said.Just as the WTC Final tune kept playing through the interaction, the discussions around the impending Australia series also came up. But Rohit kept reminding one and all that it is important to stay in the moment.""It doesn't matter where we play in two months' time, we want to win here. In modern-day cricket, a break of one month is a long time, so it's nice to have everyone back and then start the season on a high,"" Rohit said.While the core of the Indian team has remained more or less the same over the last few years, it's the exterior that has changed. Rahul Dravid , with whom Rohit used to share great camaraderie, is gone and it's Gautam Gambhir who is in charge now.The new coach, along with his new support staff of Abhishek Nayar Morne Morkel and Ryan ten Doeschate, have come in with fresh ideas and it is the Indian skipper's turn to adapt.""I have known Gautam and Abhishek very well over the years. And against Morne, I have played a lot of very tough cricket. As far as Ryan goes, what I experienced in Sri Lanka (during an ODI series last month), I felt he is a very sensible and understanding personality. Having said that, these people will be different from Rahul bhai, Vikram Rathour and Paras Mhambrey. Their way of running the team will be different and having played 17 years under different coaches, I know that. It is very important for you to understand that every coach comes in with a different perspective and different methods. So it is very important for you to adjust,"" Rohit said.While the Mumbai right-hander seemed pretty chilled out about most issues, there seemed to be a bit of history with him and Bangladesh, something that dates back to the 2015 ODI World Cup.When asked about the opposition, the captain quipped: ""Look, all the teams want to defeat India.

Yashasvi Jaiswal inches closer to overtaking this England legend in World Test Championship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/yashasvi-jaiswal-inches-closer-to-overtaking-this-england-legend-in-world-test-championship/articleshow/113444121.cms,"NEW DELHI: Yashasvi Jaiswal , the young and talented Indian batsman , has been making waves in the cricketing world with his exceptional performances in the ongoing World Test Championship ( WTC ) cycle. His meteoric rise to the top has been nothing short of remarkable, especially considering his age and the level of competition he has faced.In the recently concluded Test series against England in early 2024, Jaiswal showcased his immense potential and skill, overshadowing even the likes of Joe Root , who is currently ranked as the number one Test batsman by the ICC .While Root struggled to find his footing, Jaiswal had a series that will be remembered for years to come, scoring a magnificent 712 runs in just 9 innings at an impressive average of 89. The highlight of his performance was undoubtedly his maiden double century, which left cricket enthusiasts and experts in awe of his talent.Jaiswal's outstanding performance in the series has propelled him to the second position in the list of leading run-scorers in the 2023-25 WTC season. He is now just 320 runs behind Joe Root, who currently occupies the top spot with 1398 runs.However, it is worth noting that Root has taken 29 innings to amass these runs, maintaining an average of 53.76 and scoring 5 centuries in the process. In contrast, Jaiswal has reached the 1028-run mark in just 16 innings, showcasing his consistency and ability to score big runs.What sets Jaiswal apart from the other top run-scorers in this WTC cycle is the fact that he is the only batsman to have scored a double century among the top 15 leading run-scorers. This achievement is a testament to his ability to convert good starts into big scores and his unwavering concentration at the crease.As India gears up for their upcoming home series against Bangladesh , Yashasvi Jaiswal finds himself as the sole Indian batsman in the top 10 of the leading run-scorers list in the current WTC cycle. His presence at the top of the order has given the Indian team a solid foundation and has instilled confidence in the batting line up.Jaiswal's rise to prominence has been a result of his hard work, dedication, and natural talent. He has shown maturity beyond his years and has the ability to adapt to different playing conditions and situations. With age on his side, Jaiswal has the potential to become one of the greats of Indian cricket in the years to come.","Yashasvi Jaiswal has been making waves in the cricketing world with his exceptional performances.

Best style is the style that wins: Gautam Gambhir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/best-style-is-the-style-that-wins-gautam-gambhir/articleshow/113474889.cms,"We want to be a team that adapts and learns quickly rather than adopting one approach, says head coach

Gambhir

CHENNAI: There's an element of directness about Gautam Gambhir . Nothing too flashy or eloquent, just a matter-of-fact approach geared towards only one thing - winning. This is what made him an immensely effective cricketer during his playing days, especially at the business end of ICC tournaments.And this is precisely what is making him such a hot property as coach.Gambhir's stupendous success with a generally inconsistent Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL was a big reason behind the BCCI 's decision to make him the head coach of the national team, despite his reputation of being confrontational with the team's top star, Virat Kohli . ""My relationship with all the senior players has been really good. Importantly, I think the heart needs to be in the right place. When your intention is to take Indian cricket for ward, most of the other things can take care of themselves,"" Gambhir said on Wednesday.He made it a point to mention that his much-hyped differences with star players are ""not true"".""I've played with some of the guys who have now become experienced players. Now as a coach, it's still early days, but yes, the relationship we can build over a period of the next couple of years is going to be very important for Indian cricket. It's not only about me, to be honest. I think it's about all of us sitting in that room and having that one mission to keep taking Indian cricket forward,"" the coach said.Gauti had mixed results in his first series as India coach in a white ball series in Sri Lanka. While India won the T20Is, they lost the ODI series, playing quite poorly on spinning tracks at the Premadasa. TheBangladesh series will be his first assignment as a Test coach and everyone is keen to see what kind of an imprint he leaves.""I've believed that the best style is the style that wins and we want to be a team that adapts and that learns quickly, rather than sticking to one style. If you start adopting one style, then there is no growth. We want guys to be playing the situation, the conditions, and then keep growing every day,"" Gambhir said.Another point that came up for discussion was India's recent overreliance on spin-friendly pitches to win Tests at home. During Gambhir's playing days, the pitches in India normally used to offer five-day contests, but the recent trend has been of Tests often finishing within three days.""There has been a lot of talk regarding this. But when India went to South Africa, the Test match got over in two days as well. But no one spoke about that. Then why is this talk when it's India and spinners? The opposition needs to learn how to play against spinners rather than changing the surfaces,"" he said.For the opposition, the Gauti message is loud and clear - adapt or perish.","Gautam Gambhir is the new head coach of the Indian cricket team.

India vs Bangladesh: No time for slip-ups for India in first Test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/india-vs-bangladesh-no-time-for-slip-ups-for-india-in-first-test/articleshow/113474538.cms,"India are the world's top Test team, have a reputation of being virtually invincible at home and are looking to seal a spot in

WTC Final

before the big series Down Under. The pressure is on the hosts as Bangladesh look to put up a challenge and continue their recent run of success...

CHENNAI: ""The No. 1 team in the world."" There's a nice ring to the phrase, especially when it comes as a compliment from opponents Bangladesh, who are considered upstarts and are coming to India on the back of their most significant success in the longer version.But then such a tag has its own set of pitfalls.A single false step can raise a tsunami of criticism and that's what India have to guard against when they take on Bangladesh at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Thursday.It's a long road to the World Test Championship Final and with India looking to seal the spot before the Australia series, every match is a must-win. If pedigree is taken into consideration, Bangladesh shouldn't be a massive challenge at home, but let's go back to Dec 2022 for some perspective.On a spin-friendly track in Mirpur, India were very close to a defeat chasing 145 in the second innings of the second Test. Had it not been for the dropped catch of No. 9 batter R Ashwin , the World No. 1s might well have lost a Test which they eventually won by three wickets.On that day, the finger-spin trio of Shakib Al Hasan , Taijul Islam and Mehidy Hasan Miraz were very close to wreaking havoc on a black-soil track that India usually love playing on. All the three Bangladesh spinners are available in this series as well and India have tried to ensure that they don't get too much help from the conditions.Hence, a red-soil pitch has been dished out at Chepauk where bounce can be a crucial issue. Coach Gautam Gambhir spoke about the quality of R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja and how they can be effective on any track on the first day of a Test.While it will be interesting to see if the new coach decides to play Kuldeep Yadav as the third spinner ahead of medium-pacer Akash Deep, the one man who can really make a difference to this game is Jasprit Bumrah . The paceman has shown time and time again that he can take the pitch out of the equation and Gambhir feels it is ""more than a luxury"" to have him in the team.""It's just his hunger to play every format. The best part is that he wants to play as much Test cricket as he can. He is definitely the No. 1 bowler in the world and it's an honour to have him in this side,"" Gambhir said.As confident as Bangladesh are going into this series after their win in Pakistan, one shouldn't forget that they have serious issues in their batting. Even in the second Test that they won in Rawalpindi last month, they were reduced to 26-6 on a perfectly good batting track. It was the partnership of Litton Das and Miraj that kept them in the game, but Bumrah and Co. have too much quality to let go of an opportunity of that magnitude.The fact that the series will be played with SG balls should also give the Indian bowlers a distinct advantage. Bangladesh play with the Kookaburra at home and the amount of reverse swing that can be generated with SG balls may just be a severe test for Najmul Hossain Shanto's boys. Shanto knows that and they have tried to prepare for it.""In the camp in Dhaka followed by the three days of practice here in Chennai, we have trained with SG balls. We have tried our best to get used to it. More importantly, there's no point thinking too much about it,"" Shanto said, adding that they will be thinking about the result in the final session of the fifth day.That's quite a claim in itself. Not too many in Chennai believe the game will go beyond Saturday and if Bangladesh can truly stretch the Test that far, all those fans who are running around for tickets of the first two days will breathe a sigh of relief.","India take on Bangladesh in the first Test at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai.

Historic! Afghanistan register first-ever ODI win over South Africa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/historic-afghanistan-register-first-ever-odi-win-over-south-africa/articleshow/113467434.cms,"NEW DELHI: Afghanistan asserted their dominance over South Africa in the first One Day International at Sharjah Cricket Stadium, securing a comfortable six-wicket victory.The Afghan bowlers, spearheaded by Fazalhaq Farooqi and Azmatullah Omarzai , dismantled the South African batting lineup, restricting them to a paltry 106 runs. This paved the way for a relatively straightforward chase, despite a few early hiccups, with Afghanistan reaching the target in 26 overs.South Africa, electing to bat first after winning the toss, endured a disastrous start.The usually dependable opening pair of Reeza Hendricks and Tony de Zorzi could only muster 17 runs before Farooqi made the initial breakthrough, dismissing Hendricks for 9 runs. This triggered a catastrophic collapse, with South Africa plummeting to a precarious 36-7.Farooqi proved to be a constant menace, claiming the crucial wickets of stand-in captain Aiden Markram (2) and de Zorzi (11), finishing with impressive figures of 4-35. His new-ball partner, Azmatullah Omarzai, was equally effective, dismantling the middle order with figures of 3-20. Omarzai's victims included Tristan Stubbs and debutant Jason Smith, both dismissed for ducks, and the struggling Kyle Verreynne for 10.Adding to South Africa's woes, a moment of miscommunication resulted in Andile Phehlukwayo's run-out. As Omarzai appealed for leg before, Phehlukwayo wandered out of his crease, allowing a swift run-out opportunity that Nabi capitalized on.With the scoreboard reading a dismal 36-7 in the 10th over, South Africa faced the ignominious prospect of recording their lowest ever ODI total, a record set at 69 runs against Australia in 1993. However, a resilient eighth-wicket partnership between Wiaan Mulder and Bjorn Fortuin provided some respite.The pair added a crucial 39 runs, steering South Africa clear of the ignominy of their lowest score. Fortuin, displaying composure under pressure, top-scored with 39 runs before falling to Rashid Khan , who was returning to ODI cricket after the previous year's World Cup. Mulder, showcasing grit and determination, reached his maiden ODI half-century, eventually dismissed for a well-compiled 52 off 84 deliveries, an innings that included five boundaries and a six.Khan, displaying his trademark guile, finished with figures of 2-30, wrapping up the South African innings in the 34th over by trapping Lungi Ngidi leg before wicket.Despite the comfortable margin of victory, Afghanistan's chase was not without its share of early jitters. Rahmanullah Gurbaz departed on the third ball of the innings, caught at third man off Ngidi's bowling. The usually dependable Rahmat Shah soon followed, adjudged leg before wicket to Fortuin, leaving Afghanistan precariously placed at 15-2.Fortuin continued to pose problems, dismissing Riaz Hassan for 16, while Markram chipped in with the wicket of Hashmatullah Shahidi. However, a composed partnership between Azmatullah Omarzai (25 not out) and Gulbadin Naib (34 off 27 balls) steered Afghanistan home, ensuring a comprehensive victory in the opening encounter.","Afghanistan beat South Africa by six wickets in first ODI at Sharjah Cricket Stadium. Fazalhaq Farooqi and Azmatullah Omarzai took three wickets each.

This success led to his transfer to Juventus , where he won both the Coppa Italia and the UEFA Cup in the 1989-90 season.Schillaci who began Italy's 1990 World Cup campaign as a substitute was the top scorer of the 1990 World Cup, netting six goals, including important strikes in the semi-final against Argentina and the third-place playoff against England.His passionate, wide-eyed celebrations became symbolic moments of the tournament.

A lot at stake as Mohun Bagan get ready for Asian football,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/a-lot-at-stake-as-mohun-bagan-get-ready-for-asian-football/articleshow/113446029.cms,"KOLKATA: Mohun Bagan SG 's start to the season may be a bit bumpy. A loss to NorthEast United in the Durand Cup final to allowing Mumbai City FC to snatch a 2-2 draw in the Indian Super League opener is anything but confidence-boosting. More worryingly, the team failed to protect a 2-0 lead on both occasions.If all this has put Jose Molina under the scanner early on, Mohun Bagan's Spanish coach is not in the mood of pressing the panic button.In his football philosophy, a team's playing style is sacrosanct and her is keeping his hand in turning it into a winning formula with lessons learnt from past mistakes.However, Molina's setting-the-house-in-order job faces another intriguing test as Mohun Bagan begin their newly-formatted AFC Champions League 2 journey with a home match against Tajikistan's FC Ravshan at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday.""We are trying to play our best, to play according to our style and score as many goals as possible and concede as little as possible. Sometimes you achieve that, sometimes you don't. But it's always in our mind to play with good intensity, try to dominate, score goals and win the matches. We have to try and suffer as little as possible every match,"" Molina told reporters on Tuesday.In Molina's preferred 3-5-2 formation, Bagan's build-up play, the focus is on stretching the pitch on both sides and making full use of the space thus created in the centre of the pitch. While players are still to fully understand their positions especially in transition, the team looks vulnerable to quick counter-attacks.As their defender British defender Tom Aldred said: ""We need clean sheets to win games. But it's a new season and a new coach and we continue growing as a team.""Although a team can field six foreigners on the pitch at a time, Molina's options are limited here as well, with Portuguese defender Nuno Reis yet to join the side and Spanish centre-back Alberto Rodriguez and Australian forward Jamie Maclaren carrying injury.""It doesn't matter if all foreigners are starting or not, I'll try to put the best squad possible for winning the match,"" Molina emphasized with conviction.A two-time Tajik league champions, Ravshan, however, have all seven foreigners available, although their coach Mami Nazarzadeh Masud made it a point that for a developing football nation like his, relying on domestic players should be a prerogative.""I have gathered information about Mohun Bagan from my friends. They have played only one game (in ISL). They are fresh, while we are in the middle of our league and we are a bit tired than them,"" Masud said.The Salt Lake Stadium has not been kind to the home team so far this season.

However, the referee overturned the judgment after a VAR referral revealed no contact had occurred.Stuttgart's efforts were stopped by Courtois, and although Undav struck the crossbar, they were brought to earth at the beginning of the second half.Mbappe scored his fifth goal for the team, set up selflessly by Rodrygo, just 21 seconds after the break. Many others were still making their way back to their seats from the Bernabeu bars, so it was a case of blink and you'll miss it.The former striker for Paris Saint-Germain is as obsessed with lifting the cup as Real Madrid is, even though he was unable to win the top award in the club game while playing in France.Stuttgart failed to get the notification, and the German side leveled after Vinicius smashed a shot against the crossbar.After making several quick attempts to get near, Jamie Leweling hooked a corner back into the dangerous area, allowing Undav to go past Courtois.For the last ten minutes, Ancelotti substituted in 18-year-old Brazilian attacker Endrick in an attempt to win the game and launch the holders' title defense off to the ideal start.The goal came in the 83rd minute, but it wasn't from Madrid's galactic offensive players. Instead, it came from center-back Rudiger, who nodded in Luka Modric's corner.Vinicius squandered a fantastic opportunity to give Madrid the victory, but his countryman Endrick took full most of his one and only chance, finishing with a powerful shot from the edge of the box.",Real Madrid defeated Stuttgart 3-1 in their Champions League opener.

Manuel Neuer was injured, as per AFP.On his Champions League debut, former Crystal Palace forward Michael Olise scored twice, while Bayern also had goals from Raphael Guerreiro, Leroy Sane, and Leon Goretzka.The six-time Champions League champions had won each of their previous 20 competitive opening games, going all the way back to 2002-03.The result is one goal higher than Bayern's record-breaking 8-2 victory over Barcelona in the competition's quarterfinals in 2020.The German powerhouses gained more than just bragging rights from the huge victory, since goal differential will probably be even more crucial in the new Champions League single league system.Early on, Bayern dominated play, but their dominance went unrewarded. Goals from Serge Gnabry and Jamal Musiala were disallowed for little offsides, and Kane was eventually awarded a penalty after VAR flagged a foul on Aleksandar Pavlovic.Ivan Nevistic was sidelined by the England captain's successful penalty kick. Then, late in the first half, Bayern took control of the game with two goals in a five-minute span.On the 33rd minute, Guerreiro scored with a well-executed chested pass from Musiala, and on his Champions League debut, Olise headed in a corner from Joshua Kimmich After being pulled at halftime, Neuer, who had gone dangerously close to the halfway line to thwart a Zagreb counterattack in the opening minutes, appeared to unnerve the home team.The goal in the 48th minute was unexpected as Bruno Petkovic converted a feed from Ronael Pierre-Gabriel.Two minutes later, Takuya Ogiwara scored on the counter, and the home crowd started to question whether Bayern's trophy-less season from the previous year was returning.The next to score, though, was Kane, who scored three goals in 22 minutes in the second half to bring his total with Bayern to 53 goals in 50 games. Goretzka, Sane, and Olise also scored goals to ensure a convincing victory for the home team.After surpassing Barcelona's Xavi, Thomas Mueller-a two-time Champions League winner-was substituted in the second half for his 152nd appearance in the competition, making him the club's most active player.","Bayern Munich beat Dinamo Zagreb 9-2 to make Champions League history.

However, it was determined that the presence of the steroid was accidental, caused by a massage from his former physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi.Naldi had unknowingly transferred Clostebol to Sinner while treating his own finger with a spray containing the substance, provided by Sinner’s ex-fitness trainer, Umberto Ferrara.

"Grievances, yes, you still play for the country: Nandan Bal tells players",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/grievances-yes-you-still-play-for-the-country-nandan-bal-tells-players/articleshow/113411831.cms,"PUNE: Nandan Bal , the chairman of the national tennis selection committee , has lamented players making themselves unavailable for national duty due to their disenchantment with the national federation.A depleted Indian team suffered a humbling 0-4 rout to Sweden in Stockholm over the weekend, and it came after top singles players Sumit Nagal and Mukund Sasikumar as well as leading doubles player Yuki Bhambri were not available for selection for different reasons.While Nagal cited a back strain he had picked up during the US Open, Mukund was apparently banned for two ties - which even the player was not aware of - whereas Bhambri's reasons were not known.Nonetheless, it is understood that the trio as well as a few other players are upset with the national association's ( AITA ) way of functioning, the key aspect being a lack of professionalism in the team set up.For instance, the team doesn't have a designated professional manager and instead a state association official or an AITA office-bearer travels with the squad. AITA secretary Anil Dhupar accompanied the team to Sweden, in the latest instance.Bal admitted the players' grievances were genuine but still believed that those factors should not come in the way of representing the country.""I don't agree when a player says that, because the team atmosphere is not good or they are not happy with the association, that he will not play,"" Bal said.""When I play, I play for my country, I am not playing for AITA. Maybe I am from a different generation or think differently, but even after all those arguments, I will still play for my country.""Bal also did not agree that the players didn't find it worth taking a break from their professional careers, only to find that professionalism of the personnel attached to the team were not upto the standard expected at the top level.""I was part of the squad picked for the 1982 Asian Games (in Delhi). We were called for six two-week camps that year. That's 12 weeks, and here we are talking about 12 days a year,"" he said.""We were also making a living out of playing tennis. As a result, one can check the records, my ranking was somewhere around (a career-high 309) at the start of the year (1981), and then it dropped (to 503 at the end of 1983).""And the next year, I still played for my country.""Against Sweden, both the team selection and match tactics have come under scrutiny.After Nagal withdrew, the selection committee opted to bring in 16-year-old Manas Dhamne - ahead of 21-year-old Karan Singh, who was also ranked higher - as reserve while 18-year-old Aryan Shah, previously the reserve, became part of the nominations.Eventually, Rajpal played doubles specialists Ramkumar Ramanathan (who has not won a singles match on the ATP circuit since May), Sriram Balaji in both singles and doubles.Bal said the committee chose to give Dhamne the exposure once it became clear that the captain was ""reasonably certain"" to play Ramkumar and Balaji, and to some extent Niki Poonacha.""As much as I agree (with fielding Aryan in singles with an eye on future), he is also ranked higher, as a captain you would go with a player who has the experience of 30-40 ties, how the surface is playing, all that would have made an impact (on Rajpal's decision),"" he said.""He has played a lot of tennis. He has travelled a lot, he knows his tennis.""Ram and Balaji knew what the battle was, what they were getting into. They were dignified and fought it out.""Asked to sum up his thoughts on India's performance in Stockholm, Bal said, ""Disappointing.""""When you are playing with a half deck, the way we crumbled, says it all. Even with Sumit, Sasi and Yuki in the mix, Sweden would have been tough to beat at home anyway,"" he added.""Don't know if we can blame the players, or the captain or the coach, when we have two doubles players playing singles, it had to happen.""Doubles could have been closer, but when you are 0-2 down it is not easy to fight back. You need extra-ordinary players who can say, 'let's take it one match at a time'.""We did it against Brazil (in Chennai in 2010) when we had the class of Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi .""",Top singles players Sumit Nagal and Mukund Sasikumar as well as leading doubles player Yuki Bhambri were not available for selection for different reasons.
