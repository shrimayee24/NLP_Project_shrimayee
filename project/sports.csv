Matthew Stafford thrilled about Rams landing Davante Adams, calls it a game-changing move



The Los Angeles Rams are gearing up for an electrifying season, fueled by the leadership of veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford and the high-profile acquisition of wide receiver Davante Adams . With Adams joining the offense, the Rams are making a bold statement about their ambitions in the ever-competitive NFC West . However, the transition comes with challenges, particularly following the departure of longtime star Cooper Kupp to a divisional rival.After a turbulent period following their Super Bowl victory, the Rams are determined to reclaim their status as one of the NFL’s elite teams. The front office made a major splash in free agency by signing Davante Adams to a lucrative two-year, $44 million deal, solidifying their receiving corps. Adams, a three-time All-Pro, brings a wealth of experience and an established reputation as one of the league’s premier wideouts. Despite a less-than-stellar season with the New York Jets, his track record—including five consecutive 1,000-yard campaigns—suggests he still has plenty left in the tank.Matthew Stafford, who has seen his fair share of ups and downs with the franchise, expressed his excitement about the addition of Adams. “I have a ton of respect for him, the way he goes about his business and the way he plays the game,” Stafford shared with the Los Angeles Times. “He’s been a big-time in this league for a long time, so happy to have him. I know he’s going to be a big addition to our team.”While Adams is expected to take on a significant role, the Rams’ receiving hierarchy will still revolve around rising star Puka Nacua . Adams’ ability to complement Nacua rather than directly replace Kupp could be the key to unlocking the Rams’ offensive potential.The departure of Cooper Kupp, one of the most beloved figures in Rams history, left a significant void. The former Super Bowl MVP was a pillar of the franchise, and his move to the Seattle Seahawks added an extra layer of intrigue to the upcoming season. Stafford acknowledged the emotional aspect of losing a key teammate but expressed his well wishes for Kupp. “A great teammate, a great Ram—I think everybody here knows that and can appreciate what he was for our team and what he was for this community,” Stafford noted. “Happy that he landed somewhere he wanted to be and got the deal he deserved.”With Kupp now in Seattle, the Rams will face their former star at least twice a year, setting the stage for must-watch matchups. The NFC West rivalry between the Rams and Seahawks has been intense in recent years, and Kupp’s presence on the other side will only amplify the stakes.For Los Angeles, the focus now shifts to ensuring Adams thrives in Sean McVay’s offensive system. Unlike Kupp, who battled injuries in recent seasons, Adams has remained more durable, giving Stafford a reliable target who can stretch the field. At 32 years old, Adams still possesses the skill set that made him one of the most feared receivers in the league. With McVay’s creative play-calling and Stafford’s arm strength, the Rams’ offense could be poised for a resurgence.Also Read: ""Ugly, stupid, miserable”: Taylor Swift’s ex-boyfriend’s brother faces backlash over comments about the Pop Star As the season approaches, all eyes will be on how quickly Adams gels with his new team. If he can recapture his dominant form, the Rams may find themselves right back in the mix for postseason contention—proving that their aggressive offseason moves were more than just a gamble.","Matthew Stafford thrilled about Rams landing Davante Adams, calls it a game- changing move.

Tom Brady opens up about the ‘tension’ with Bill Belichick that led to their Patriots split



Why Tom Brady chose Tampa Bay



Tom Brady and Bill Belichick: From tension to respect



Few partnerships in the history of sports have been as dominant as the one shared between Tom Brady and Bill Belichick . Together, they built a dynasty with the New England Patriots , capturing six Super Bowl titles and leaving an indelible mark on the NFL . However, all good things must come to an end, and in 2020, Brady made the pivotal decision to part ways with the franchise, signing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . While speculation and reports have long surrounded the reasons behind the breakup, Brady recently offered fresh insight into why their legendary run came to a close.In his weekly newsletter, The 199, Brady reflected on the inevitable separation, acknowledging that a natural tension had developed between himself and Belichick.""The reality was, after twenty years together, a natural tension had developed between where Coach Belichick and I were headed in our careers, and where the Patriots were moving as a franchise,"" Brady wrote. ""It was the kind of tension that could only be resolved by some kind of split or one of us reassessing our priorities.""It was no secret that the Patriots' strict and often ruthless approach to roster management was a defining trait under Belichick. The team thrived on discipline, adaptability, and a business-first mentality, which worked wonders for two decades. But as Brady entered his forties, his priorities began to shift. He had already sacrificed financially for the team by signing team-friendly deals, and reports suggested that he grew frustrated with the lack of long-term commitment from the organization. ESPN’s Seth Wickersham detailed in his book It’s Better to Be Feared that Brady was discontented with how the team managed its finances and how little say he had in personnel decisions.Brady’s decision to leave was not made overnight. He admitted that thoughts of free agency lingered in his mind for ""two to three years"" before his departure.""It was a creeping decision that lived passively in the back of my mind for [two to three] years,"" Brady explained. ""Until March of 2020 when a whirlwind of a few days made me realize that a decision was coming sooner rather than later.""With time running out and an uncertain future in New England, Brady opted for a fresh start in Tampa Bay. His decision, he said, came down to a meticulous evaluation process.""I asked myself, as someone headed into their forties with school-age kids and twenty years' worth of battle scars, what truly mattered to me now?"" Brady continued. ""What I ended up with was a list of about twenty things that I then ranked and graded on a weighted scale from 1 to 3. In the end, I chose Tampa, almost exactly five years ago now, because, in the aggregate, it graded out higher than New England along those twenty or so dimensions. It’s not much more complicated than that.""Though their final years together were marked by friction, time appears to have softened any lingering hard feelings. Brady and Belichick have spoken positively about each other in recent years, and Belichick was even an invited guest at Brady’s roast earlier this year. Additionally, when the Las Vegas Raiders were searching for a new head coach, Brady reportedly reached out to gauge Belichick’s interest in the position before the team ultimately hired Pete Carroll.Also Read: ""Going to be a big addition"": Matthew Stafford shares excitement over Rams' blockbuster signing of Davante Adams ahead of the 2025 NFL season While the breakup between Brady and the Patriots was inevitable, it’s clear that the quarterback has no regrets about his decision. His candid reflections confirm that the tension between himself and Belichick was real, but they also serve as a testament to the incredible success they achieved together. Their relationship may have had its share of friction, but their legacy as one of the greatest player-coach duos in sports history remains untouchable.","Tom Brady and Bill Belichick built a dynasty with the New England Patriots.

Is LeBron James playing tonight? Los Angeles Lakers injury report for tonight’s game against the Orlando Magic (March 24, 2025)

How to watch the Los Angeles Lakers play tonight against the Orlando Magic (March 24, 2025)

Thehead into Monday night’s matchup against the Orlando Magic with, but the Magic are dealing with even bigger health concerns of their own. The Lakers (43-27) will be without Maxi Kleber (foot) and could miss Rui Hachimura (patellar, questionable), while Orlando (33-38) faces a depleted roster with multiple key players sidelined. LeBron James might gear up for tonight’s game against the Orlando Magic. LeBron James, the Los Angeles Lakers’ leading scorer at 24.9 points per game (11th in the NBA), is expected to play but could be limited. His recent form—27.4 points, 9.6 rebounds, and 7.7 assists over the last 20 games—remains crucial for Los Angeles as they push for playoff seeding. His presence would give the Lakers an edge against Orlando’s top-ranked defense, which allows just 106.1 points per game.However, the Magic’s injury report paints a grim picture. Starting guard Cole Anthony (toe) and reserve wing Trevelin Queen (ankle) are both questionable, leaving Orlando potentially shorthanded in the backcourt. Even worse, the team has already lost two key contributors for the season—Moritz Wagner (knee) and Jalen Suggs (quadricep). Wagner’s absence hurts their frontcourt depth, while Suggs’ defensive energy and playmaking will be sorely missed.Orlando’s offense, already the worst in the league at 104.8 points per game, will struggle even more if Anthony can’t play. The Magic rely heavily on Paolo Banchero (27.8 PPG last 20 games) and Franz Wagner (23.0 PPG) to carry the scoring load, but without additional firepower, they’ll have a tough time keeping up with the Los Angeles Lakers.Los Angeles, meanwhile, will look to exploit Orlando’s weakened lineup. If LeBron James plays, his playmaking and scoring could overwhelm the Magic’s defense. If Hachimura is also available, his versatility adds another layer to the Lakers’ attack.Also read: Will Luka Doncic play tonight against the Orlando Magic?

Auston Matthews discussed “Inconsistencies” in the Toronto Maple Leafs but fans are not happy with it



Auston Matthews , one of the most talented and popular players in the NHL, has had a tough time in the current season of the NHL. Auston Matthews’ team, the Toronto Maple Leafs, has recorded a pretty average performance this time. While the team had managed to maintain a winning streak in the last few matches, things changed when the Toronto Maple Leafs lost the match to the Nashville Predators in their last match.Just after the Toronto Maple Leafs lost their last match to the Nashville Predators, the captain of the team, Auston Matthews spoke about the loss to the media.Auston Matthews added, “The inconsistencies aren’t ideal, especially at this time of year.”The star player also spoke about the winning streak the Maple Leafs enjoyed before losing it to the Nashville Predators.

Try this: ""The inconsistencies are unacceptable. It must be frustrating for fans to watch. Winners are consistently dominant, and we're not there yet. We've still got some runway left, so we're going to drill that message home""”Another fan wrote, “He’s struggling so much to score, that he’s gonna average over a goal a game in the playoffs😤”Last week, the Toronto Maple Leafs started their winning streak after they defeated the Calgary Flames.

NHL to halt game for on-ice live ceremony



Ovechkin's CELEBRATION PLAN when he Breaks the Goal Record!

NHL delegation to keep close eye on Alex Ovechkin's chase



Alex Ovechkin remains focused as the record beckons



Everyone is excited about Alex Ovechkin’s possible game where he may be set to make history. While fans and analysts talk about how it will be celebrated, the National Hockey League (NHL) is not holding back in making his record-breaking achievement a grand one. With the Washington Capitals captain inching closer to Wayne Gretzky's historic all-time goal-scoring mark, the league has planned extensively to celebrate the milestone.When Alex Ovechkin scores his 895th career goal, officially breaking Wayne Gretzky's record, the NHL will freeze play for a ceremony. The ceremony will be limited to seven minutes, according to NHL insider Chris Johnston, to have as minimal an effect as possible on the rhythm of the game while still honouring Ovechkin's incredible achievement.“There’s actually going to be a ceremony in real time,” Johnston said. “This is a pretty special moment, a special goal. But they’re going to limit it to seven minutes. There will be a delay in whatever game when Ovechkin ultimately reaches this. It could be a big moment of a pretty big game, at least for one of the other teams.”The decision to cut back on the ceremony time is because while the Washington Capitals have already made it to the playoffs, visiting teams could be in do-or-die playoff battles. A long break would disrupt their rhythm, and therefore a brief tribute would be the most ideal.When Alex Ovechkin comes within four goals of breaking Wayne Gretzky's record, a special NHL delegation of 15 celebrity guests—Gretzky and Commissioner Gary Bettman among them—will be at every Washington Capitals game. This way, they are sure to see the historic occasion wherever it occurs.Interestingly, while there will be an on-ice ceremony of sorts when Ovechkin passes Gretzky's record, the bigger tribute will occur when he sits atop the record book. The NHL has said that this event will be given the seriousness and gravitas it merits, paying tribute to Ovechkin's achievement in the sport.Going into his Washington Capitals' next match-up with the Winnipeg Jets, Alex Ovechkin remains seven goals away from rewriting history books. Although he missed a goal during the Capitals' latest win at 6-3 against the Florida Panthers, the super winger recorded two significant assists to keep his team at the top of the Metropolitan Division.Also read: Alex Ovechkin rewrites NHL history, records his 15th NHL season with 35 or more goals With the Capitals resting on an astonishing 47-15-8 record, Ovechkin's feat will be simply the icing on the cake of what has proven to be a dominating season by the team.

The Kansas City Chiefs have Travis Kelce back for the 2025-26 season, but his days as the team's top tight end might be numbered.Kelce returns to the Chiefs at age 35, clearly past his prime years. He's a franchise legend, racking up 12,151 receiving yards over 174 regular season games. But his numbers have steadily declined since 2022, the last season he crossed 1,000 receiving yards.Last season, Kelce caught 97 passes on 133 targets, but managed just three touchdowns—his career-low. It's reassuring to see Kelce on the field again, but the Chiefs should strongly consider increasing Noah Gray 's snaps.Noah Gray, drafted in the fifth round by the Chiefs in 2021, keeps improving. Last season was Gray's best yet, posting career-highs with 437 receiving yards and five touchdowns from 40 catches on 49 targets.At age 26, Gray is entering his prime years. Keeping him limited behind a declining Kelce could be a serious mistake. Kansas City recognized Gray’s potential with a contract extension, clearly seeing his value beyond a typical fifth-round pick.Pro Football Focus graded Gray at 74.2 last season, placing him eighth among all tight ends. Kelce's grade was 70.9, ranking him 15th. Gray objectively outperformed Kelce, suggesting it's time for Kansas City to prioritize youth over legacy.Taylor Swift dominated the recent iHeartRadio Music Awards , earning nine awards, including Artist of the Year, Pop Artist of the Year, and a special honor for her global ""Eras Tour,"" plus six fan-voted categories.Though Swift missed the event at the Dolby Theater in LA, she sent a recorded acceptance speech. Fans speculated her boyfriend, Chiefs star Travis Kelce, filmed the video, citing what appeared to be his reflection in Swift's trophy.While that theory remains uncertain, Donna Kelce, Travis' mother, made her support clear.

Aaron Rodgers longs for Packers-like stability; Steelers should steer clear anyway,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-longs-for-packers-like-stability-steelers-should-steer-clear-anyway/articleshow/119433120.cms,"(Image via Imagn Images)

Pittsburgh Steelers offer Aaron Rodgers stability, but is it enough?

Aaron Rodgers won’t solve Steelers' fundamental problems

""The Pat McAfee Show.""

Signing Aaron Rodgers hurts Steelers' long-term prospects

Read More

Aaron Rodgers is back in the spotlight, visiting teams and keeping everyone guessing about his next move, per Albert Breer. He dropped by the Pittsburgh Steelers facility on Friday, meeting GM Omar Khan, coach Mike Tomlin, offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, and other staff. Rodgers stayed from about 9am until 3pm, getting a feel for the Steelers' environment.Money doesn't seem like a significant factor here. Rodgers’ decision hinges primarily on finding a team culture matching what he once had in Green Bay. Ironically, after two drama-filled seasons with the Jets, Rodgers now openly admits his time in Wisconsin was better than he previously thought. Call it nostalgia or clarity gained through a tough stretch in New York, but people close to Rodgers confirm he's genuinely reconsidering his Green Bay years in a more positive light.Pittsburgh presents an appealing scenario if Rodgers wants familiarity. The Steelers franchise mirrors Green Bay’s stability—a family-owned feel, consistent culture, and veteran players hungry to win immediately. T.J. Watt, Minkah Fitzpatrick, Cam Heyward, and newly added DK Metcalf represent seasoned leadership Rodgers would appreciate.Yet the Steelers' interest feels shortsighted. Rodgers, turning 41, isn’t the quarterback who won multiple MVPs. He can still deliver remarkable plays occasionally, but age matters, and consistency fades.Sure, Rodgers might boost Pittsburgh by a couple of wins. If Mason Rudolph gives them eight victories, Rodgers could possibly elevate them to 10. But two extra wins aren’t transformative. Rodgers costs roughly $30 million more than Rudolph and brings an increased injury risk. Remember, Rodgers went down injured early in the 2023 season—he’s likely to miss more time.Even if Rodgers remains healthy, Pittsburgh isn’t equipped to topple the AFC North or make a deep playoff run. Rodgers won’t suddenly dominate elite quarterbacks in high-pressure games. He’s simply no longer at that elite level, and neither are the Steelers.Rodgers will unquestionably dominate headlines, especially through his regular appearances onIf Pittsburgh becomes a mess, Rodgers won’t shy away from publicly airing grievances. His presence would immediately overshadow the coaching staff, particularly offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, who would likely yield control to Rodgers. Even Tomlin would defer somewhat, although more subtly.Rodgers' motivation remains individualistic rather than team-driven. He’s never been a vocal leader, and that likely won't change at 41. Players like Cam Heyward—long-time Steelers leaders—would probably find Rodgers’ self-centered approach frustrating.Adding Rodgers might excite fans and sell tickets. ""Hall of Fame quarterback joins Hall of Fame coach"" is excellent for PR. But beyond initial excitement, it’s not beneficial long-term.Rodgers won’t drastically improve Pittsburgh’s position. It’s like treating a serious wound with a superficial fix—the problem remains underneath. For sustainable improvement, the Steelers should honestly embrace a down year.Think logically. History proves the Steelers succeed by bottoming out briefly, then selecting a top-tier quarterback. In 1970, a 1-13 season yielded Terry Bradshaw and Super Bowl victories followed. Similarly, a 6-10 record in 2003 got them Ben Roethlisberger, leading to two more titles.Yet, the Steelers stubbornly cling to mediocrity. Consistent 8-9 or 10-7 seasons deliver average draft picks, not franchise quarterbacks. Pursuing Rodgers continues Pittsburgh’s pattern of choosing short-term optics over long-term excellence.As harsh as it sounds, the Steelers need a 5-12 season more than they need Aaron Rodgers. It positions them perfectly for a premium quarterback prospect in the 2026 draft, which Pittsburgh itself will host. That scenario offers genuine, long-lasting improvement.Rodgers to Pittsburgh is exciting but superficial. If the Steelers genuinely prioritize future championships over immediate headlines, they’ll pass on Rodgers. But history suggests they’ll stubbornly stick to their current approach—and once again miss the point.","Aaron Rodgers is back in the spotlight, visiting teams and keeping everyone guessing about his next move.

I am very happy that I was successful and that Icould touch my god.”Arrested and slapped with BNS sections on application of criminal force, criminal trespass and reckless actions putting lives or safety of others in danger, Rituparno had been sent to police custody for a day on Sunday, with magistrate Kaustav Mukhopadhyay advising him to “be like Kohli in life” and not risk others’ lives by breaching security.On Monday, magistrate Mukhopadhyay turned down cops’ plea for further custody and granted him bail on the condition that he should not enter Eden for any IPL match this season or venture anywhere near the stadium. Rituparno’s mother, Kakali , also made a fervent appeal to police and judiciary to forgive her son and emphasised how he idolised Kohli.“He adores Virat Kohli. For him, he is god. We are requesting cops and judiciary to forgive him con sidering his age and career,” she said at her home in East Burdwan’s Jamalpur.His father, who was outside the court, said he was a farmer but did his best to fulfil his son’s desire of becoming a cricketer. An HS examinee from Parbatpur High School, Pakhira has been taking cricket coaching since the age of 12 at Netaji Athletics Club in Jamalpur. Now, he trains at aclub in Beleghata. On Sunday, he had told the court that it was his “childhood dream” to take Kohli’s blessings and that is why he had breached security.“The magistrate granted him bail on the condition that he cannot be seen inside or anywhere near Eden during this IPL season,” said Arup Chakraborty, public prosecutor at Bankshall court.","HS student Rituparno Pakhira, 18, scaled the fence at Eden and invaded the pitch to dive at his idol Virat Kohli's feet during the KKR vs RCB match. Kohli hugged him before security personnel whisked him away. He claimed he did not at all ""regret"" his act.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119454034,imgsize-1019272,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/119454034.jpg"

DC in IPL 2025: Delhi Capitals target maiden title under Axar Patel

Delhi Capitals ' Ashutosh Sharma dedicated his Player of the Match award to ""Shikhar paaji"" ( Shikhar Dhawan ) after leading his team to a one-wicket victory against Lucknow Super Giants in IPL 2025 .The uncapped Ashutosh emerged as DC's saviour when the team was struggling at 65/5 while chasing a target of 210 runs.Entering as an impact substitute for Mukesh Kumar, Ashutosh remained unbeaten with 66 runs off 31 balls and sealed the victory with a six.""I learned from the last year because there were a few games where I couldn't finish the game, so I have been focusing on finishing games, even in domestic cricket. I have a lot of belief in myself that if I play till the last over and the last ball, anything can happen.""""You just have to stay calm, believe, and think about what shots you can play that you have practised, so that's what I did today.""The 26-year-old's success was complemented by crucial partnerships throughout the batting lineup, notably from debutant Vipraj Nigam .The 20-year-old leg-break spinner Nigam contributed significantly with a quick 39 runs from 15 deliveries, supporting Ashutosh's match-winning effort.""Firstly, I want to say Vipraj played very well. It was a good innings. I told him that if he is being able to connect, he should keep hitting. I just stayed calm and didn't put too much pressure on myself.""Before concluding, Ashutosh acknowledged his mentor, presumably former Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan, whom he had played alongside at Punjab Kings in the previous IPL season.""I just want to dedicate this man-of-the-match award to my mentor Shikhar paaji.""",Delhi Capitals beat Lucknow Super Giants by one wicket in IPL 2025.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

The Punjab Kings will begin their IPL 2025 season against the Gujarat Titans today, with Shreyas Iyer making his debut as captain.After 18 years without a title, the franchise is counting on Iyer’s leadership to turn their fortunes around. Having led Kolkata Knight Riders to IPL title last season and Delhi Capitals to the final in 2020, Iyer is seen as the ideal choice to revitalise the team.Punjab Kings have struggled in recent seasons, failing to reach the top five in the last four editions. Their best IPL result came in 2014, when they were runners-up, and in 2018, when they reached the semifinals.Iyer’s appointment as captain represents a new strategy, further strengthened by his reunion with coach Ricky Ponting, with whom he has enjoyed success in the past.Both captains - Iyer and Shubman Gill - come into this match in great form, following their performances in India's recent Champions Trophy win in Dubai. Iyer led in run-scoring with 243 runs in five matches, while Gujarat Titans' skipper Gill impressed with a century against Bangladesh.The Gujarat Titans, who won the IPL title in 2022 and were runners-up in 2023, faced challenges last season under Gill's captaincy, finishing eighth.Aiming for a strong comeback, the Titans have built a formidable squad, featuring Gill and Jos Buttler as openers, along with a solid middle order including Sherfane Rutherford, Sai Sudharsan, and Masood Shahrukh Khan. The all-round capabilities of Rashid Khan, Rahul Tewatia, Glenn Phillips, Washington Sundar, and Mahipal Lomror enhance their depth and potential.Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad has hosted 25 IPL matches in its history with the side batting second winning 15 of them. If that stat alone were a reflection, the winning captain at the toss should choose to field first.With Gill suggesting a 240-260 run total in the pre-match press conference, expect one more run-fest this season.In the last match played at this venue, Rajasthan Royals beat the Royal Challengers Bengaluru. Batting first, RCB scored 172 and RR chased that down courtesy Yashasvi Jaiswal's rapid 45 runs. The highest total at this venue is 233, scored by Gujarat Titans.Shubman Gill (C), Jos Buttler, Sai Sudarshan, Shahrukh Khan, Glenn Philips, Washington Sundar, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Mohammed Siraj.GT Impact Subs: Ishant Sharma/Mahipal LomrorShreyas Iyer, Prabhsimran Singh, Priyansh Arya, Marcus Stoinis, Glenn Maxwell , Shashank Singh, Nehal Wadhera/Suryansh Shedge, Marco Jansen, Harpreet Brar, Lockie Ferguson, Arshdeep SinghPBKS Impact Subs: Yuzvendra Chahal/Vishnu Vinod.Gujarat Giants: Shubman Gill (c), Anuj Rawat, Jos Buttler, Kumar Kushagra, Sherfane Rutherford, Sai Sudharsan, M Shahrukh Khan, Rashid Khan, Karim Janat, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Phillips, Nishant Sindhu, Manav Suthar, Rahul Tewatia, Washington Sundar, Arshad Khan, Gerald Coetzee, Gurnoor Brar, Kulwant Khejroliya, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Kagiso Rabada, Sai Kishore, Ishant Sharma, Jayant Yadav.Punjab Kings: Shreyas Iyer (c), Priyansh Arya, Pyla Avinash, Harnoor Singh, Josh Inglis, Prabhsimran Singh, Vishnu Vinod, Nehal Wadhera, Azmatullah Omarzai, Aaron Hardie, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Musheer Khan, Shashank Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Suryansh Shedge, Arshdeep Singh, Xavier Bartlett, Yuzvendra Chahal, Praveen Dubey, Lockie Ferguson, Harpreet Brar, Kuldeep Sen, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Yash Thakur.Gujarat, who ventured into the IPL in 2022, have met Punjab only five times in IPL history.

'It was for all the supporters': Ishan Kishan on animated celebration after scoring hundred

NEW DELHI: Ashutosh Sharma stood firm, kept his composure, and unleashed his batting firepower when it mattered the most, guiding Delhi Capitals to a thrilling last-over victory against Lucknow Super Giants in their IPL 2025 opener at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium in Visakhapatnam.The young batter roared in celebration, swinging his bat and gesturing animatedly toward the Delhi Capitals dugout after sealing a breathtaking chase.Ashutosh was the hero of the night, smashing an unbeaten 66 off just 31 balls, rescuing his side from the brink of defeat and steering them to a stunning one-wicket win.Earlier, Lucknow Super Giants put up a formidable total of 209/8 in 20 overs, powered by Mitchell Marsh ’s explosive 72 off 36 balls and Nicholas Pooran ’s blistering 75 off 30. Despite their efforts, LSG couldn't keep Ashutosh from scripting a memorable turnaround.Delhi Capitals’ chase got off to a nightmare start as they crumbled to 7/3 within two overs, with Shardul Thakur and Manimaran Siddharth wreaking havoc. Jake Fraser-McGurk, Abishek Porel, and Sameer Rizvi fell cheaply, putting DC on the back foot.Captain Axar Patel (22 off 11) and Faf du Plessis (29 off 18) tried to rebuild, but DC still found themselves struggling at 113/6 in the 13th over, requiring 97 runs off just 45 balls.That’s when Ashutosh turned the game on its head.Displaying a perfect balance of composure and controlled aggression, he took on the LSG bowlers fearlessly, dispatching five boundaries and five towering sixes. His calculated counterattack kept DC alive in the chase.Vipraj Nigam provided vital support with a quickfire 39 off 15 balls, building a game-changing partnership with Ashutosh that reignited Delhi’s hopes.With 18 runs needed off the last two overs, Ashutosh kept his nerve, expertly maneuvering the strike and punishing loose deliveries. Despite losing Kuldeep Yadav in the penultimate over, he remained unfazed.Then, with just a few runs required, Ashutosh finished things off in style—launching a stunning straight six off the third ball of the final over, sealing an unforgettable win for Delhi Capitals and etching his name as the hero of the night.","Delhi Capitals beat Lucknow Super Giants by one wicket in their IPL 2025 opener.

LSG in IPL 2025: Rishabh Pant to lead Lucknow Super Giants in bid for first title

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

Lucknow Super Giants owner Sanjiv Goenka met with Rishabh Pant for a discussion following Lucknow Super Giants' defeat to Delhi Capitals in their IPL 2025 opening match. Goenka-owned LSG had acquired Pant for a record sum of Rs 27 crore during the mega auction.LSG had DC struggling at 113 for six while defending 210 runs but couldn't secure the victory. Ashutosh Sharma's outstanding performance of 66 not out from 31 balls guided DC to victory with one wicket and three balls remaining in Visakhapatnam.Pant's debut as LSG captain was underwhelming across all aspects of the game. He scored a duck from six balls, falling to Kuldeep Yadav, in a high-scoring match where five batters achieved strike rates above 200.His leadership decisions were questioned, particularly regarding Shardul Thakur's limited use. Despite taking two wickets in his first over, Thakur only bowled two overs in total.With 22 runs needed from the final two overs, Pant chose inexperienced Prince Yadav over Shardul. Prince conceded 16 runs, including two fours and a six.In the last over, with just a run per ball required, Pant opted for left-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed instead of the experienced Shardul, who has previously secured victories for India in similar situations.A crucial stumping opportunity was missed by Pant in the final over. Though Shahbaz beat Mohit Sharma with an excellent delivery, Pant failed to collect the ball after it deflected off Mohit's back pad.""Definitely luck plays a part in this game and if it could have missed his (Mohit Sharma's) pads, it was a chance for stumping. But these things happen in the game of cricket, you can't focus on these things, but rather you need to play better cricket,"" Pant stated during the post-match presentation.Following the match, Goenka seemingly had a conversation with Pant and coach Justin Langer. While less intense than his previous discussion with former captain KL Rahul in IPL 2024, it served as a subtle reminder for Pant to improve his performance.Delhi's chase began poorly at 7-3 in the second over. The situation worsened when they lost five wickets for 65 runs, including Faf du Plessis who scored 29 in his first match for the team.DC captain Axar Patel contributed 22 runs quickly, while Tristan Stubbs added 34 to the chase.",Lucknow Super Giants owner Sanjiv Goenka met with Rishabh Pant following their defeat to Delhi Capitals in their IPL 2025 opening match.

During a media interaction, Sidhu discussed their legendary status, leadership qualities and the immense impact they’ve had on the game across generations.""People call them icons. I call them institutions,” Sidhu remarked passionately. “Virat Kohli's name will stay for generations. Dhoni's name will stay for generations. Why?

He compared Kohli to Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, noting their ability to fill stadiums with their mere presence.""And someone with his charisma and magnetism has eclipsed across the globe. Across the globe, he is a great role model. The kids in the street want to be Virat Kohli. That's the kind of impact,"" Sidhu said.Turning to Dhoni, Sidhu did not hold back his admiration, particularly emphasising his leadership qualities and the respect he commands even at the age of 43.""Somewhere down the line, if you look at Dhoni, the best captain that India has ever produced by miles. The one who makes the world move. A leader is the one who moves forward. Man's rank is his ability to uplift. The one who instills faith in those who follow him. The one who makes ordinary people extraordinary,"" Sidhu asserted.He was particularly impressed by Dhoni’s recent wicketkeeping display, where the veteran cricketer’s lightning-quick stumping left fans and pundits in awe.""He is 42 (43) years old, friend. Look at the way he did that stumping. It was greased lightning yesterday. I mean, a young man will not be able to do it. How he inspires people,"" Sidhu exclaimed.Sidhu noted that Dhoni’s larger-than-life presence transcends the game itself, as opposing teams eagerly gather to interact with him after Chennai Super Kings matches, showcasing his unparalleled stature.","Former India opener Navjot Singh Sidhu was speaking as a JioStar expert during the ongoing IPL.

'He handled it superbly': Paras Mhambrey on Vignesh Puthur's dream debut vs CSK

Suspense over

continues

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians lost their opening match of the Indian Premier League 2025 against Chennai Super Kings at Chepauk on Sunday and the side left for Ahmedabad the next morning. With their next fixture against Gujarat Titans still a few days away, the Hardik Pandya-led unit will be spending a couple of rest days in Jamnagar for team bonding activities before preparations for the next game take over.It wasn't an ideal start for a depleted Mumbai unit as they went down to CSK in their season opener. On a sluggish surface, the team never got going with the bat and didn't have enough runs on the board to challenge the opposition. They will be bolstered by the return of regular captain Hardik Pandya , who missed the opening game due to a slow-over rate penalty from last season.Pandya did travel with the team, hit some lusty blows in the nets and his presence was felt as MI missed his all-round abilities against Chennai. Suryakumar Yadav led the side in his absence but wasn't able to make a substantial contribution with the bat.Rohit Sharma too was dismissed for a duck and the only positives for MI in that game were the contributions made by Deepak Chahar and instant impact of Vignesh Puthur . The 24-year-old chinaman returned with three wickets and showed no signs of pressure whatsoever on the big stage, in front of a packed crowd.There is no return date for Jasprit Bumrah yet but Mumbai Indians bowling coach Paras Mhambrey said that he is making good progress, and the MI management is in constant touch with the medical team overseeing his rehabilitation at the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Centre of Excellence (CoE). Mhambrey asserted that the seamer has been an integral part of MI for years now and continues to be a valuable asset for the side.","Mumbai Indians lost their opening match of the Indian Premier League 2025 against Chennai Super Kings at Chepauk on Sunday.

SRH in IPL 2025: Sunrisers Hyderabad target title with big-hitting players

Former Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh faced criticism for making a racially insensitive comment about England fast bowler Jofra Archer during an IPL 2025 match between Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad .The incident occurred in the 18th over of the first innings when Archer was bowling to SRH batters Ishan Kishan and Heinrich Klaasen. The controversial remark came after Klaasen hit consecutive boundaries against Archer.""London me kaali taxi ka meter tez bhaagta hai, Aur yaha pe Archer sahab ka meter bhi tez bhaaga hai (In London the black cabs meter runs fast and here the meter of Archer runs fast),"" said the former India spinner in commentary.The comment sparked outrage on social media, with fans demanding Harbhajan's immediate removal from the IPL 2025 commentary panel.Archer had a difficult debut in IPL 2025, conceding 76 runs without taking any wickets against Hyderabad.

MI in IPL 2025: After wooden spoon, Mumbai Indians target better show

IPL 2025: How will KKR, MI, CSK, SRH, RCB fare this season?

TimesofIndia.com in Chennai: Four players made their Indian Premier League debut in the Chennai Super Kings vs Mumbai Indians clash at Chepauk on Sunday but it was the little-known Vignesh Puthur who made a splash in front of a packed house. The 24-year-old chinaman bowler , son of an auto driver, from Malappuram in Kerala was the latest dispatch from MI's scouting stable, and the youngster made instant impact with 3/32 against a star-studded CSK outfit.Puthur's journey to MI's blue and gold is a fascinating one as he was picked up at the auction for Rs 30 lakh after an impressive show in the franchise's trials. Amongst the many who had assembled, Puthur caught the attention with his accuracy, consistent turn and ability to keep a cool head under pressure. It was enough to raise the paddle and from there on, the management chalked out a plan to groom the inexperienced spinner who had very little exposure at the higher level.The MI Cape Town unit was set to assemble in South Africa for the SA20 in January and Puthur was summoned as a net bowler and spent a lot of time working on his skills with the likes of Rashid Khan. The invaluable experience of rubbing shoulders with the greats of the game did his confidence a world of good and he even played three games for the Reliance team in the DY Patil T20 tournament before the pre-season preparations got underway.In the nets, during match simulations and practice fixtures, the management led by head coach Mahela Jayawardene were convinced to give the boy an early chance in the IPL and feedback from Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav also pushed his case.""Rohit, Surya, Tillak, all these guys batted against him (in the nets)... it wasn't easy that easy (to pick him). So one of the reasons we felt that we have the confidence of pushing him in this game. And it turned out to be excellent. It was a good decision,"" said MI bowling coach Paras Mhambrey .He lavished praise on the scouting team, who unearthed Puthur from the Kerala Cricket League, for unearthing a talent like him and further explained what they look for when picking these youngsters.""We have good guys who can spot talent. I think the idea with MI is seeing the potential more than anything else. And when we saw him for one of our trials, we saw the potential in him. Rather than looking into how much cricket he's played in the past. But it's purely thought that he has the potential. And you saw that today,"" added Mhambrey.Amidst deafening whistles and chants, Puthur returned with the wickets of Ruturaj Gaikwad, Shivam Dube and Deepak Hooda but what impressed the MI dugout the most was his ability to hold nerves and handle the pressure. It was something they had worked on behind the scenes and the regular conversations with coaches Mahela, Kieron Pollard and senior players like Rohit helped Puthur understand his role, expectations of the team and the culture of the MI dressing room.""Yes, he hasn't played much cricket. But we got an opportunity where he worked a little bit. Got an opportunity to work with him after we had a couple of trials. Not purely on the skill work so much really. I think that he is pretty much sorted out there I feel. But more about the conversations that he had an opportunity with MJ. Or Pollard. Or the batters, especially Surya and Rohit. I think that really helped with him in understanding the requirements. And understanding his role in the team. And what we expect out of him,"" explained Mhambrey.Sharing the dressing room with India and overseas stars, having a post-match chat with MS Dhoni is the stuff dreams are made of, and Puthur lived that on Sunday night. The social media traction sky-rocketed in lightning quick time but the bowling coach asserts he is a ""sweet kid"" just soaking it all in ""like a sponge"".""He's a lovely kid to have in the team. He's more like a sponge right now, just absorbing everything, looking around, you know, having conversations. I thought not everyone gets an opportunity in a dressing room to get an opportunity to chat with MJ, someone who has so much experience. Surya, Tilak, Rohit, you know, all these guys. He's just listening.""You have heroes, you see them playing on the TV, and all of a sudden you're sharing that dressing room with them, sitting next to someone like Rohit. It's a dream come true for a lot of these guys, right? But purely the way he responded... never looked like he was under pressure from the very first ball. And that was good to see,"" says Mhambrey.The first impression has been a good one and now everyone in the MI dugout would hope it turns out to be a long and successful innings like their previous boy wonders - Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Krunal Pandya, Tilak Varma - who went on to become household names.",Vignesh Puthur made his IPL debut against Chennai Super Kings on Sunday.

SRH in IPL 2025: Sunrisers Hyderabad target title with big-hitting players

RR in IPL 2025: Rajasthan Royals hope for first title in 17 years

Brief scores: SRH 286/6

beat RR 242/6

by 44 runs.

Hyderabad: Ishan Kishan made a sensational debut for his new team on Sunday. A stunning maiden, unbeaten 106 (47b, 11x4, 6x6) by the southpaw set up last year’s runners-up Sunrisers Hyderabad ’s 44-run win over Rajasthan Royals Courtesy the blitzkrieg, SRH racked up the league’s second-highest total of 286/6, just shy of their record of 287/3 they set against Royal Challengers Bengaluru last season. SRH now have the most 250+ totals — four — in IPL . Chasing an imposing target, the visitors, who played into SRH’s hands by inviting them to bat first on a belter, finished at 242/6.Ishan, whose first reaction after being acquired by SRH for Rs 11.25 crore at the mega auction was to call SRH opener Abhishek Sharma and ask what was expected of him, said 300 crossed his mind. “In the middle someone came with the message saying that we have to achieve that target. I said I didn’t know we had a target in mind. But, it is good posting such big totals,” said Ishan.Sunday’s innings could well prove a giant first step for Kishan’s return into national reckoning, after a couple of bleak seasons that may have forced introspection and a rekindling of ambition. It was such a rollicking start to his SRH stint that even the Rajasthan Royals batting coach Vikram Rathour had words of appreciation — “when someone scores a century of that kind, there is everything to like about it.”Kishan later said that the flying kisses after reaching his century were meant for his fans and his brother — Raj Kishan — who was in the stands. The SRH No. 3 credited the team management for his hurricane knock. “It was important for me to gain confidence from the start. The captain is so supportive, and the coach is on the mark. He told me that if the ball is in my slot, I should go for it. That sort of confidence from your team captain is a big boost,” Ishan said later.He justified coach Daniel Vettori’s faith by sending the Rajasthan bowlers on a leather hunt after SRH’s opening duo of Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma smashed 45 runs in 3.1 overs before Sharma was dismissed by Maheesh Theekshana.Head plundered 23 runs (4x4, 1x6) off Jofra Archer’s first over, as the Englishman had the ignominy of returning the worst figures in the league. His none for 76 eclipsed Mohit Sharma’s none for 73 for Gujarat.Kishan and Head took the hosts to 94/1 in the Powerplay and galloped past 100 in 6.4 overs. Head reached his fifty off 21 deliveries, but two overs later he departed hitting straight to Shimron Hetmyer off Tushar Deshpande. Head and Kishan added 85 off 39 balls as the hosts reached 135/2 at the halfway stage. Kishan and Nitish Kumar Reddy (30 off 15b, 4x4, 1x6) never took their foot off the pedal.Kishan clobbered Archer for three sixes in the 13th over and another off Farooqi as the hosts reached 200 in the 15th over. Heinrich Klaasen then took over, smacking 34 off just 14 deliveries (5x4, 1x6).After adding 56 runs with Kishan, Klaasen holed out in the penultimate over. But Kishan smashed two sixes and ran a brace in the same over to reach his century off 45 deliveries.At 273/3 in 19 overs, the hosts looked like getting the highest total overall. But Deshpande bowled a good final over.(Ishan Kishan 106 not out, Travis Head 67, Heinrich Klaasen 34, Nitish Kumar Reddy 30; Tushar Deshpande 3/44)(Dhruv Jurel 70, Sanju Samson 66, Shimron Hetmyer 42, Shubham Dubey 34 not out; Harshal Patel 2/34)","Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Rajasthan Royals by 44 runs in IPL 2025. Ishan Kishan scored unbeaten 106 (47b, 11x4, 6x6) to set up victory. Hosts posted second- highest total of 286/6, just shy of their record of 287/3.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119406184,imgsize-139954,width-400,resizemode-4/119406184.jpg"

As it happened:

NEW DELHI: Afghanistan's mystery spinner Noor Ahmad made an unforgettable debut for Chennai Super Kings (CSK), claiming a sensational four-wicket haul to script a memorable four-wicket win over Mumbai Indians (MI) in their IPL 2025 opener at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai, on Sunday.Ahmad’s figures of 4 for 18 were not only the best by any CSK spinner against MI but also pivotal in restricting the visitors to a modest 155/9 on a typically slow Chepauk surface.In a match that continued MI's unfortunate streak of not winning their opening game since 2012, Noor Ahmad was the undeniable game-changer. His spell broke the backbone of MI's batting, leaving them struggling to gain any momentum. After Khaleel Ahmed (3/29) struck early by dismissing Rohit Sharma for a duck and Ryan Rickelton for 13, Ahmad took over the middle overs with his deceptive variations.The highlight of Ahmad’s spell came when he dismissed MI's stand-in captain Suryakumar Yadav (29 off 26) with a lightning-quick stumping by MS Dhoni , who showcased his evergreen reflexes behind the stumps. Dhoni’s brilliance not only highlighted his continued prowess but also underlined Ahmad’s skill to fox the batter with a well-disguised delivery.Ahmad followed it up by trapping Tilak Varma (31 off 25) with a googly and dismissing Robin Minz and Naman Dhir in quick succession. The MI middle-order was left in tatters as Ahmad's wizardry spun them into disarray.Despite Deepak Chahar’s late resistance with a fiery 28 off 15 balls, MI could only muster 155/9, a total that never looked threatening.Chasing 156, CSK got off to a steady start, anchored by skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad, who smashed 53 off 26 balls before falling to IPL debutant Vignesh Puthur (3/32). Puthur briefly troubled CSK with his left-arm spin, removing Gaikwad, Shivam Dube and Deepak Hooda in quick succession. However, Rachin Ravindra’s unbeaten 65 off 45 balls ensured CSK’s march towards victory.The crowd erupted when MS Dhoni walked out to bat with just four runs needed, but it was Ravindra who sealed the win with a towering six, as CSK reached the target in 19.1 overs.With this victory, CSK extended their dominance over MI, having won six of the last seven head-to-head encounters since the second leg of IPL 2021.","Chennai Super Kings (CSK) beat Mumbai Indians (MI) by four wickets in their IPL 2025 opener at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai, on Sunday.
