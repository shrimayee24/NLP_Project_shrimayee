NEW DELHI: The UEFA Champions League draw for the 2024/25 season is set to take place on Thursday in Monaco . The competition has undergone significant changes, with the number of participating clubs increasing from 32 to 36.France's Ligue 1 has been granted an additional automatic qualification spot, bringing their total to three, as they are currently the fifth-best European league according to UEFA's ranking.Furthermore, Germany and Italy, the two leagues with the highest coefficient ranking from the previous season in UEFA competition, have each been awarded an extra berth. The final additional slot will be given to a national champion emerging from the qualifying rounds, which are scheduled to conclude this midweek.The format of the Champions League has undergone a radical change. Since 2003, the competition featured 32 clubs divided into eight groups of four, with the top two from each section progressing to the last 16.However, starting from this season, the 36 clubs will be pooled together in a single league, following a ""Swiss system"" format, which is more commonly associated with chess tournaments.The Champions League group stage has undergone significant changes. Previously, teams played six matches against each opponent, both home and away. Under the new format, clubs will participate in eight games.The 36 participating teams will be divided into four seeded pots, each containing nine teams. Every club will face two teams from each pot, playing one match at home and one away.UEFA states that this ""raises the prospect for fans of seeing the top teams go head to head more often and earlier in the competition,"" acknowledging that this format was introduced when the threat of a breakaway Super League loomed over European football.No team will face another club from their domestic league, and a maximum of two teams from any one country can be drawn against each other.The expansion of the Champions League means that the group stage, which previously concluded in December, will now include two additional matchdays in January. The total number of games will increase from 96 in the old group stage to 144 in the new league phase.After the league phase, the top eight clubs will directly advance to the last 16, while teams ranked 9th to 24th will participate in a two-legged play-off round to determine the remaining spots in the last 16.These play-off ties will be seeded based on positions in the league phase. The bottom 12 teams will be eliminated from the competition, with no access to the Europa League , unlike in previous years.","UEFA Champions League draw for the 2024/25 season is set to take place on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Over 100 members of the Indian contingent, including 52 athletes across various sports, will participate in the Paris Paralympics opening ceremony. This event is significant as it marks the first time the ceremony is being held outside a stadium in the history of the Games.However, athletes with events scheduled for the following day, such as all 10 members of the shooting team, will not participate in the parade of nations.""All athletes competing on August 29 will not join the opening ceremony as it would be challenging for them to perform the next day. The shooting team will skip the parade of nations,"" said Devendra Jhajharia, president of the Paralympics Committee of India.The shooting team, which includes Tokyo gold medallist Avani Lekhara, is currently based in Chateauroux, over 200km from Paris, where the shooting events are set to take place.Sumit Antil (F64) and Bhagyashree Jadhav (F34) will serve as the joint flag bearers for India at the opening ceremony. This event will take place outdoors at the Champs-Elysees and Place de la Concorde in central Paris. Delegations from all countries will march down a section of the Champs-Elysees, one of Paris's most iconic avenues.Sumit Antil is the defending gold medallist in javelin, while Bhagyashree Jadhav competes in shot put.This follows the example of the Paris Olympics opening ceremony, which was also held outside a traditional stadium on July 26, along the Seine River.India has sent a record 84-member team to the Paris Paralympics, aiming to win 25 medals, including at least ten golds. At the 2021 Tokyo Paralympics, India's 54-member team won 19 medals, including five golds.","The full day-by-day schedule for Indian athletes at the Paris 2024 Paralympics is as follows. Indian athletes will compete in swimming, cycling, Table Tennis, Archery, Taekwondo and Shooting. The Games will take place between August 28 and 30, 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112853730,imgsize-114094,width-400,resizemode-4/112853730.jpg"

He made his debut for the Indian national team in 2016 and quickly established himself as a key player across all formats.Bumrah's unique bowling action and exceptional ability to generate pace and bounce have made him one of the most feared bowlers in world cricket.He is particularly known for his death bowling, where he excels at containing runs and taking crucial wickets.A video is viral on the internet where during an event Bumrah is asked if there is any batsman who he thinks has been tough to bowl to.As the crowd cheered on, Bumrah gave a very smart answer, without naming any batsman.Bumrah says, ""Look I want to give a good answer but the real factor is that I don't want anyone to take over me in my head because obviously I respect everyone, but in my head I tell myself that if I do my job well, there's nobody in the world who can stop me. So I look at myself rather than the opponent so if I think that I have control over everything and if I give myself the best opportunity, everything else will take care of itself rather than giving the power to the batsman that he'll get the better of me and he's better than me, so that I don't want to.""To say that Bumrah played a pivotal role in India's T20 World Cup triumph in June this year would be an understatement.Bumrah took 15 wickets at an average of 8.26, finishing with an astonishing economy of just 4.17 that was the best rate of those to bowl a minimum of 20 overs at the tournament and was named the Player of the Tournament in a campaign that saw India winning their first ICC trophy after 2013.Even though Bumrah has dealt with some injury issues over the years, which have occasionally kept him out of action, he remains a crucial part of the Indian cricket team's plans, especially in major tournaments like the World Cup.Bumrah is also the first bowler in the history of the game to be ranked Number One in the ICC Rankings in all the three formats.","Jasprit Bumrah is one of the premier fast bowlers in international cricket.

*Joint-top scorer with Lionel Messi and Neymar

NEW DELHI: Cristiano Ronaldo , the all-time leading goalscorer in the UEFA Champions League, was honoured by UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin with a special award. This recognition took place on Thursday, 29 August, during the inaugural 2024/25 UEFA Champions League 36-team league phase draw ceremony at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco. The award celebrates Ronaldo's outstanding legacy in the world’s premier club competition.Ronaldo, who has played for Sporting Clube de Portugal, Manchester United , Real Madrid, and Juventus, has scored 140 Champions League goals in 183 appearances.He leads Lionel Messi by 11 goals and is 46 goals ahead of third-place Robert Lewandowski . Over his career spanning more than 18 years, Ronaldo’s contributions to the Champions League have been monumental.""Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the brightest stars in the UEFA Champions League constellation. His extraordinary goalscoring achievements in the competition seem destined to stand the test of time, posing a remarkable challenge for future generations to surpass. His sustained excellence at the highest level is a testament to his relentless pursuit of both team and individual honours. Over more than two decades, he has continuously evolved and refined his game while preserving a youthful passion for scoring and celebrating goals. His professionalism, work ethic, dedication and ability to shine on the grandest stage are qualities that football players everywhere should aspire to emulate,"" said UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin.Ronaldo's impressive record includes finishing seven separate Champions League seasons as the leading scorer, a feat unmatched by any other player. His scoring prowess ranges from eight goals in Manchester United’s 2007/08 victorious campaign to 15 goals when Real Madrid secured their third consecutive title in 2017/18.Additionally, Ronaldo holds the record for the most goals in a single Champions League season, with 17 goals in the 2013/14 season, including a goal in the extra-time win against Atlético de Madrid in the final.The Portugal forward has won the Champions League once with Manchester United and four times with Real Madrid, making him the first player since 1992 to win the competition five times. Ronaldo is also the only player to have scored in three different Champions League finals (2008, 2014, 2017).Ronaldo also holds the record for the longest Champions League scoring streak, having struck in 11 successive matches from June 2017 to April 2018.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan left out star pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi for the second Test match against Bangladesh starting in Rawalpindi on Friday, with Pakistan's head coach Jason Gillespie saying he will be rested to allow him to spend time with his new-born son and family.Bangladesh upset a formidable home team with a clinical ten-wicket display in the first Test -- their first win in over 14 encounters against Pakistan, as Afridi struggled to find his rhythm through much of the innings.Now former Pakistan batsman Ahmad Shahzad has questioned the decision to drop Afridi from the team.Taking to his official X handle, Ahmad Shahzad said in a video, ""You first lost to Zimbabwe, then lost to Ireland, lost to USA, lost to India, now you have lost to Bangladesh as well. Is Shaheen Afridi only responsible for all these defeats? No, he is not solely responsible. All should be questioned who were involved in these defeats. Tell this country. Holding Shaheen Afridi alone responsible for all the defeats is wrong. Look at his performances, there's a problem in his attitude, you dropped him, that's fine. But what about others? What about their performances? What is the performance of Abdullah Shafique in the last 8 matches? You have brought in Saim Ayub back after 25 matches, what's his performance? What's the performance of Babar Azam in the last 14 innings in Tests?""""So by dropping only Afridi will not Pakistan on the right track, you will have to take some harsh decisions. And those who have been involved in these defeats with poor performances should also be questioned. They also should be held accountable, because nobody is beiger than cricket or the country. Country comes first, everything comes after that. No matter how are their public relations, no matter how much they hide behind their personal milestones, no matter how much money they put in, but we know everything and those who are at the helm of affairs in the PCB, their also know everything. So the time has come that not just one, if you really want to move in the right direction, question all those who have been involved. Things will not work like this,"" Ahmad Shahzad said.Pakistan have been struggling through a lean spell of late, bowing out early in this year's T20 World Cup. Their last Test series was a whitewash in a three-match tour to Australia.The home team have recalled spinner Abrar Ahmed after going with an all-pace attack in the first Test.Former Australian pacer Gillespie admitted it will be a challenge to square the series, but he backed under-pressure skipper Shan Masood who failed with the bat with six and 14 in the first match, and has lost all four of his Tests as captain.Pakistan were rattled by the Bangladesh response to their first-innings total of 448-6 declared, crumbling for a paltry 146 in their second outing.A brilliant 191 by Mushfiqur Rahim on a flat Rawalpindi pitch helped the visitors rack up their highest-ever total against Pakistan of 565 to take a crucial 117-run first-innings lead.Spinners Mehidy Hasan Miraz (4-21) and Shakib Al Hasan (3-44) then rocked the hosts and made them rue not playing a frontline spinner.Since gaining Test status in 2000, Bangladesh have only won two of their 32 overseas series with wins in the West Indies (2009) and Zimbabwe (2021), drawing three and losing 27.Bangladesh's pace attack will be boosted by the return of experienced Taskin Ahmed who recovered from a shoulder injury but will have a tie with Nahid Rana for a place in the eleven.Shan Masood (C), Saud Shakeel (VC), Abrar Ahmed, Abdullah Shafique, Babar Azam, Khurram Shahzad, Mir Hamza, Mohammad Ali, Mohammad Rizwan (WK), Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub and Salman Ali AghaNajmul Hossain Shanto (C), Mahmudul Hasan Joy, Zakir Hasan, Shadman Islam, Mominul Haque, Mushfiqur Rahim, Shakib Al Hasan, Litton Kumer Das, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Taijul Islam , Nayeem Hasan, Nahid Rana, Shoriful Islam, Hasan Mahmud, Taskin Ahmed, Syed Khaled Ahmed",Pakistan left out star pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi for the second Test match against Bangladesh.

NEW DELHI: It's been quite some time since fans last witnessed a bilateral cricket series between India and Pakistan. The last such instance was 2012-13. The two teams have only faced each other in multi-nation tournaments since then, like the Asia Cup and ICC events. The absence of regular India-Pakistan matches has left fans yearning for the return of those thrilling encounters.Recently, Cricket Australia chief executive Nick Hockley expressed interest in hosting an India-Pakistan bilateral series in Australia.But that didn't find much interest among the two boards.In the recently concluded 2024 T20 World Cup, the two nations clashed in a group-stage match in New York, with India securing a narrow six-run victory. Rohit Sharma's Indian team went on to win the trophy, while the then captain Babar Azam’s Pakistan got eliminated in the group stage.The last time Pakistan hosted India was in 2005-06, where Pakistan won the three-match Test series 1-0, while India claimed the ODI series with a 4-1 margin.Pakistan have hosted teams from Australia, Bangladesh, England, New Zealand, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and the West Indies in the past few years. It has led to former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batsman Kamran Akmal questioning the BCCI, asking why India cannot travel to Pakistan when teams like Australia have done so."" India vs Pakistan matches bring fans together. That's why it's known as the mother of all clashes. We toured India several times—in 2004, 2007, and 2011. We received so much love from India and a lot of support. There's no doubt that a home team always gets support from its home crowd, but we also got the same kind of support. Indian fans showered us with love whenever the Pakistan team, including me, stepped out of the hotel room, I mean, off the field. If any team wants to play good cricket or enjoy the game, please visit India. Indian fans are the best in the world,"" Akmal told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.""Similarly, Pakistan fans love Indian cricketers. Whenever India traveled to Pakistan, our fans greeted them with smiles. Virender Sehwag has spoken about the love he received in Pakistan many times. Dada (Sourav Ganguly) has also talked a lot about his love for Pakistan fans. Our fans support the Indian team just as they support the Pakistan team. We all want the India vs Pakistan bilateral series to happen. We are missing the India vs Pakistan series,"" he said.Akmal was part of the Pakistan cricket team that toured India in 2005, 2007 and 2013. He played against India when Pakistan hosted them in 2004 and 2006.""I consider myself lucky that I traveled to India and played several series, both home and away. I really enjoyed those times. India should travel to Pakistan, and Pakistan should go to India. Let's keep the political matters aside and play and love cricket,"" Akmal said.""When a team like Australia can visit Pakistan, why not India? The India-Pakistan bilateral series should happen. Both governments need to sit and talk. This will benefit cricket,"" he said.India's participation in the upcoming Champions Trophy in Pakistan next February-March is also in doubt, owing to the tense political relations between the two countries.""Pehle aapne Asia Cup le liya, ab Champions Trophy ki baatein kar rahe hain. Kyun kar rahe hain aap aisa? (first you took away the Asia Cu from Pakistn, now taliing about Champions Trophy, why?)...Pakistan has done a lot of hard work to bring cricket back to the country. If India invites Pakistan, our government will never stop us. They will say, 'Go and play.' The Indian government should do the same. Let's keep politics aside and play cricket,"" Akmal added.Pakistan players have been barred from the Indian Premier (IPL) League due to political tensions between the two nationsIn the inaugural IPL season, some top Pakistani cricketers, including Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Akhtar, and Sohail Tanvir, showcased their talent.Tanvir also emerged as the leading wicket-taker in 2008. However, after the 2008 Mumbai attacks, IPL banned Pakistani players.""BCCI has its own rules. If the bilateral series resumes, the debate about Pakistan players not playing in the IPL will also end. If you don't want to give us a chance in the IPL, that's fine with us. We don't need it. We are not worrying about those lines. We have our own PSL (Pakistan Super League). I know PSL can't match IPL in terms of facilities and finances, but let's play international cricket,"" Kamran said.","Kamran Akmal questions why India cannot travel to Pakistan when teams like Australia have done so.

'Umran Malik is a classic case': Former India bowling coach on why the fast bowler faded away,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/umran-malik-is-a-classic-case-former-india-bowling-coach-on-why-the-fast-bowler-faded-away/articleshow/112881313.cms,"NEW DELHI: Young fast bowler Umran Malik rose to fame with a remarkable IPL season for Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2022, thanks to his blistering pace and ability to consistently bowl over 150 km/h. His performances earned him a spot in the Indian white-ball squad , where he played 10 ODIs and 8 T20Is, taking 24 wickets within just over a year.Despite this early promise, Malik has not featured for India in more than a year, raising questions about the decline of the once-promising fast bowler.Former India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey believes that Malik's rapid rise without substantial red-ball cricket experience is a significant factor in his current predicament.According to Mhambrey, Malik's swift ascent to the national team via the IPL is typical of a bowler who lacks the grounding that comes from playing longer formats. With only 12 First-Class matches under his belt, Malik has struggled to maintain his place in the national lineup.""Umran is a classic case of someone who has not played enough red-ball cricket,"" Mhambrey told The Indian Express. ""He came into reckoning through the IPL. That's 24 balls in a game. Sometimes you don't even get to bowl 24 balls. The amount of pressure in bowling 24 balls is not like the red ball. I feel this (T20) is not a format to judge a prospect.""Mhambrey emphasizes the importance of First-Class cricket for developing a bowler's skills and endurance. He explains that while the IPL offers a platform for showcasing talent, it doesn't replicate the mental and physical demands of longer formats.""For all the perks that come with bowling in the IPL, it has its repercussions as well,"" Mhambrey continued. ""We made sure that he played Ranji Trophy and red-ball cricket. The moment you play one season, you understand your bowling. Physically, you will be tested in different phases of the game. Sometimes you will have to be on the ground for six sessions. And to be able to bowl with that intensity when the last session is coming up, you will be physically and mentally challenged. And you need to go through that.""Mhambrey's insights highlight a crucial element in Umran Malik's development: the need for experience and endurance that comes only from playing red-ball cricket. Without this foundation, Malik has found it challenging to adjust to the rigors of international cricket, leading to his exclusion from the team.",Former India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey believes Umran Malik's rapid rise to the national team is due to a lack of red-ball cricket experience.

However, makeshift opener Dan Lawrence was dismissed for nine, caught behind off Lahiru Kumara, who was brought in for Vishwa Fernando.Pope's struggles continued as in his debut match as England captain; he was out for just one when he top-edged a pull off Asitha Fernando, with De Silva catching him well while running back from square leg.Root was at 11 when he faced a strong lbw appeal from Kumara's full-length delivery, but umpire Paul Reiffel’s not-out decision was upheld after Sri Lanka's review. Left-arm spinner Prabath Jayasuriya then struck with his fourth ball, dismissing Duckett who top-edged a reverse sweep to Kumara on the boundary. Duckett’s promising knock ended at 40 runs from 47 balls.After lunch, England were at 97 for 3 with Root sharing a 48-run stand with Harry Brook, who scored 33, and a 62-run partnership with wicketkeeper Jamie Smith, who made 21. Chris Woakes, however, was dismissed carelessly, pulling Fernando straight to long leg for six, leaving England at 216-6.Root, who was 81 not out at tea, spent 12 balls on 99 before edging one run shy of his century. He then gracefully guided a four between slip and gully off Kumara to complete his hundred, with his 13th four in 162 balls.Root, by reaching three figures, moved into joint-tenth place in an all-time list of Test century-makers headed by India's Sachin Tendulkar Root also tied the former England captain Alastair Cook 's record of 33 Test centuries, but he did this in 145 matches compared to Cook’s 161 games. Root, who debuted in 2012, is the only active cricketer in the top ranks of Test century-makers.Root was eventually out for 143, skying an unorthodox ramp shot off Milan Rathnayake to Pathum Nissanka at point, leaving England at 308-7.But Gus Atkinson countered aggressively, hitting Jayasuriya for two straight sixes and reaching his maiden Test fifty in 61 balls with a textbook cover-drive off Rathnayake.The 26-year-old also took advantage of the new ball, pulling Kumara for a six over midwicket, helping England close the day at 358 for 7.","Joe Root scores a record-equalling 33rd Test hundred to place England in a strong position on the opening day of the second Test against Sri Lanka.

Alexei Popyrin

is up next for champ after steamy conditions test Djokovic's resolve in round 2 before opponent Djere throws in the towel

The heat was on Novak Djokovic at the US Open . In successive outings at the Arthur Ashe stadium , the Serb, who is chasing history, a 25th major title, made just 47 percent of his first serves.The 37-year-old, tennis' most decorated champion, who appeared to be gasping for air in humid conditions, called for the physio and took a tablet at the end of the hour-long first set.The second seed finally came through when compatriot Laslo Djere threw in the towel early in the third set with the final score reading 6-4, 6-4, 2-0.Djere had two break-point opportunities in the seventh game of the second set when he led 4-2. Had he broken, Djere would have served for the second set. The 29-year-old, however, did not win another game in the match. He called a medical timeout before serving at 4-5 and received treatment in the abdominal area.Djokovic, who became the first male player to record 90 wins at all four majors, goes up against the in-form Alexei Popyrin in the third round. The 37-year-old leads the lanky Aussie, 12 years his junior and ranked some 26 slots below him, 3-0 in head-to-head clashes. Djokovic won their two meetings this year, at the Australian Open and Wimbledon , both times in four sets. The 25-year-old, nicknamed Pop, has made some rapid strides since then. Popyrin moved from the periphery to a challenger in majors when he claimed theMontreal Masters 1000 crown earlier in August. On Wednesday he defeated Spain's Pedro Martinez 6-2, 6-4, 6-0 to make the third round.""I'm happy to win in four sets another time,"" Djokovic said of his third round meeting Friday. ""He keeps getting closer and closer, knocking on that door. He's a really good player. He has improved a lot. We always knew he has a big serve and forehand, but I think his backhand and his movement have improved a lot.""Djokovic added, ""He's going to go for the win. I know that.""
