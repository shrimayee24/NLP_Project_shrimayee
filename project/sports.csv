A moment of reckoning

Maharashtra politics has rarely been short of convulsions, but even by the state’s turbulent standards, the untimely demise of deputy chief minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Ajit Pawar in the January 28 plane crash has thrown up a new challenge to the coastal state’s already fragile political equilibrium.The loss of Ajit ‘Dada’ Pawar goes beyond emotional, as it has ripped open cracks that had appeared to be sealed after the Maharashtra local body polls seemingly settled the near-constant realignments seen since 2019.With Sunetra Pawar, Ajit Pawar’s wife and a Rajya Sabha member, sworn in as deputy CM on Saturday, stepping into the role held by her husband, the state has formally entered a new and uncertain phase, shaped by the vacuum left bydeath.Sunetra Pawar’s elevation may have filled the immediate constitutional vacuum, but it has also foregrounded larger, unresolved questions about the NCP’s future, the ruling Mahayuti alliance’s stability, and the direction the state’s politics will take in the absence of one of its most influential power brokers.Ajit Pawar was more than a mass leader from Baramati or a powerful Pawar family scion.For allies and adversaries alike, he was a political manager popularly considered par excellence, a negotiator who understood the language of power, and a bridge between rival camps that otherwise struggled to trust each other.His absence now raises fundamental questions, and at the centre of this unfolding story is Sunetra Pawar.Her rise, propelled by tragedy, sympathy and political necessity, comes at a moment when the NCP itself is at a crossroads, caught between reunification and reinvention.The significance of the current moment lies in the arc of Maharashtra politics that has trudged through rupture and realignments. The first major rupture came after the 2019 assembly elections, when the long-standing BJP–Shiv Sena alliance collapsed over the chief ministership.The same year, in November, Ajit Pawar stunned the political spectrum by taking oath as deputy CM alongside rival Devendra Fadnavis in a pre-dawn ceremony, even as talks were underway for the formation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) comprising the Shiv Sena, the Congress and the NCP.The government lasted less than four days, but the episode marked the first visible rupture between Ajit Pawar and his uncle Sharad Pawar.However, Ajit returned to his uncle and, interestingly, took an oath again as deputy CM under the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) banner, an ideologically unlikely coalition of the Shiv Sena (then undivided), the Congress and the Sharad Pawar-led NCP, which was born after the Sena-BJP split.That experiment in power-sharing ended dramatically in June 2022, when Eknath Shinde led a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, bringing down the Uddhav Thackeray government.A year later, in July 2023, Ajit Pawar engineered a similar split within the NCP, taking a majority of MLAs with him into the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA).The Election Commission subsequently recognised Ajit Pawar’s faction as the legitimate NCP, awarding it the party’s name and the ‘clock’ symbol.These twin splits fundamentally altered Maharashtra’s political landscape. Power shifted decisively towards the BJP, which emerged as the principal pole around which regional actors revolved.Ajit Pawar’s entry into the Mahayuti government as deputy CM was widely seen as a masterstroke, and criticised alike, given corruption charges against Pawar, which the BJP itself vehemently highlighted.However, Ajit Pawar gave the BJP numerical stability to its government and leverage over its other ally, the Shinde-led Shiv Sena.The 2024 Lok Sabha elections and subsequent assembly and local body polls appeared, at least superficially, to bring a measure of stability. The Mahayuti retained power, the opposition regrouped, and after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and other civic elections, the sense in political circles was that the era of constant churn might finally be easing.However, Ajit Pawar’s untimely death shattered that assumption.Ajit Pawar’s political journey was marked by ambition, controversy and resilience. Over three decades, he built an image as a decisive administrator and an uncompromising leader, particularly in western Maharashtra’s cooperative and sugar belt. Even critics conceded that he had an unmatched command over the bureaucracy and a reputation for keeping his word.Within the Mahayuti, Ajit Pawar played a unique role. For the BJP, he was both an ally and a counterweight. His presence ensured that the Shinde faction of the Shiv Sena did not emerge as the sole regional power broker in the alliance. For chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, Ajit was a partner who could deliver numbers, manage legislators, and absorb political shocks.His death has therefore left a void that is not easily filled. While the government remains numerically secure, the internal balance within the Mahayuti has been disrupted. The question now is whether any other leader can replicate Ajit Pawar’s ability to straddle competing interests without destabilising the alliance.It is in this competitive political landscape that Sunetra Pawar’s elevation has become a centre of Maharashtra’s politics. Married into the Pawar family in 1985, she spent decades away from active politics, focusing largely on social work in and around Baramati. Her initiatives in sanitation, women’s self-help groups and rural development earned her quiet respect, but little public visibility.Her entry into electoral politics came only in 2024, when Ajit Pawar fielded her against cousin Supriya Sule from the bastion Baramati Lok Sabha constituency.The contest was as much about family and symbolism as it was about politics. Sunetra lost by a significant margin of over 1.5 lakh votes, reaffirming both Supriya Sule’s entrenched base and the limits of Sunetra’s political reach at the time.However, her subsequent nomination to the Rajya Sabha gave her a formal role and exposure to national politics. Now, in the wake of Ajit Pawar’s death, she finds herself at the centre of a leadership transition driven by sympathy, continuity and the Pawar family legacy.Earlier, senior NCP leaders publicly backed Sunetra Pawar’s elevation as leader of the legislature party, clearing the way for her induction into the Maharashtra cabinet. Within the party, her appointment is widely seen as a means of honouring Ajit Pawar’s legacy while pre-empting internal factionalism at a moment of uncertainty.While the names of Ajit Pawar’s sons, Jay and Parth, briefly surfaced in internal discussions, continuity emerged as the decisive consideration. That logic worked overwhelmingly in Sunetra Pawar’s favour. As Ajit Pawar’s spouse, and the most senior figure within his immediate family, the 62-year-old Rajya Sabha member was viewed as best placed to provide stability, particularly in a party where seniority still carries considerable weight in leadership transitions.Ajit Pawar was surrounded by a formidable cohort of experienced leaders within the NCP, including Praful Patel, Dilip Walse Patil, Chhagan Bhujbal, Hasan Mushrif, Sunil Tatkare and Dhananjay Munde, all veterans of organisational politics, the legislature and administration. While the party may not have resisted Ajit Pawar’s sons in the long term, given their lineage and legacy, Sunetra Pawar’s elevation required no negotiation even with the most seasoned among this group.Yet, the challenge before her is formidable. Sunetra Pawar lacks the organisational grounding and political toughness that Ajit Pawar honed over decades. As Deputy chief minister and a face of the party, she will have to navigate a leadership structure populated by senior figures accustomed to Maharashtra’s hard-edged politics, where personal survival has often taken precedence over party discipline.Ajit Pawar’s death has also revived discussions around a reunification of the two NCP factions. Even before the tragedy, there were signs of a thaw. The two factions had contested recent local body polls together under the NCP symbol, and leaders on both sides acknowledged that prolonged division had weakened the party.Several leaders have claimed that reunification was Ajit Pawar’s last wish, part of a longer-term strategy to secure the NCP’s relevance ahead of the 2029 elections.His reported discussions with Sharad Pawar and other senior leaders suggested that a merger was not merely tactical but deeply personal, aimed at healing family and political rifts.On Saturday, NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar made a significant revelation about the future of the NCP, saying that talks to merge the two rival NCP factions were already under way and had progressed to an advanced stage before the sudden death of his nephew.If the merger does materialise, it will raise an immediate and delicate question. Who leads the united NCP?Sharad Pawar’s stature remains unmatched, but his advancing age makes a return to active organisational leadership unlikely. This opens up the possibility of a generational transition, potentially pitching Sunetra Pawar against Supriya Sule.Such a contest would not be straightforward. Supriya Sule brings parliamentary experience, a national profile and a reputation as a consensus-builder.Sunetra Pawar, on the other hand, carries the emotional weight of Ajit Pawar’s legacy and the sympathy of party workers still grieving his loss. The choice between them would reflect deeper questions about the party’s identity that would fuel a battle between continuity versus renewal and sentiment versus structure.A compromise arrangement, with Sharad Pawar as a guiding figure and a collective leadership at the top, is also possible. But Maharashtra’s political history suggests that ambiguity at the top rarely lasts.For the BJP, Ajit Pawar’s absence alters the internal dynamics of the Mahayuti. He was widely seen as the BJP’s leverage against the Shinde-led Shiv Sena, ensuring that no single ally could dominate the alliance. Without him, the BJP will have to recalibrate its strategy.One scenario is that the BJP consolidates its position further, reducing its dependence on strong regional partners. Another is that the Shinde faction seeks greater autonomy and bargaining power, potentially leading to friction within the alliance.Sunetra Pawar’s elevation could partially mitigate this imbalance, but only if she is able to command authority within the NCP and negotiate effectively with allies. Unlike Ajit Pawar, she does not yet have a track record of hard bargaining or crisis management.The possibility of the NCP breaking away from the Mahayuti and returning to an alliance with the Congress and Sharad Pawar’s faction cannot be ruled out. Historically, the NCP’s ideological comfort has been with the Congress, particularly on issues of social justice and secularism.However, such a move would carry risks. Several NCP MLAs aligned with Ajit Pawar joined the BJP-led alliance precisely to remain in power. A sudden shift could trigger defections, weakening the party at a time when unity is crucial.Moreover, the BJP’s dominance in the assembly with 131 seats in the 288-member House means that even a united NCP’s exit would not immediately threaten the government’s survival. The real impact would be felt in regional power centres, particularly in western Maharashtra, where the NCP’s influence has traditionally been strongest.Ajit Pawar’s death has transformed Maharashtra politics in ways that are still unfolding. It has reopened questions that many believed had been settled, like the future of the NCP, the durability of the Mahayuti, and the balance between ideology and pragmatism in state politics.For Sunetra Pawar, the moment is both an opportunity and a test. Whether she emerges as a commanding leader or a transitional figure will depend on how she navigates the competing pressures of legacy, alliance politics and organisational discipline.For the NCP, the coming months may determine whether it reclaims its identity as a united regional force or continues to function as a collection of pragmatic power centres.And for Maharashtra, a state accustomed to political upheaval, Ajit Pawar’s absence marks the end of an era and the beginning of an uncertain new phase, where old equations no longer hold and new ones are still being written.","Ajit Pawar was more than a mass leader from Baramati or a powerful Pawar family scion.

Sunetra Pawar To Be Named NCP Leader, Dy CM Oath Likely Tomorrow: Chhagan Bhujbal

Zero administrative experience:

Managing party affairs:

Abrupt transition:

Acceptability among cadre:

Cracks in the family?:

NEW DELHI: By electing Sunetra Pawar as its legislative party leader and subsequently elevating her as Maharashtra’s deputy chief minister—the first woman to hold the post—just three days after the untimely demise of Ajit Pawar , the NCP has swiftly filled two of the three positions held by the Maratha strongman at the time of his death. The third post is that of NCP chief, on which no decision has been made yet.However, the road ahead is unlikely to be easy for Sunetra Pawar, who is still grieving her husband’s loss while having to shoulder his responsibilities so soon after his death.Here are the challenges in front of Maharashtra’s new deputy CM:Unlike Ajit Pawar, who was Maharashtra’s longest-serving deputy chief minister with six terms, Sunetra Pawar is a complete political newcomer. She now faces the challenge of stepping into a high-profile administrative role without prior experience in governance, making her transition into leadership all the more demanding.Despite coming from a prominent political family, Sunetra Pawar made her electoral debut only in 2024, contesting the Lok Sabha polls against her sister-in-law Supriya Sule, Ajit Pawar’s cousin. Sule retained the family stronghold of Baramati for the fourth consecutive term, after which Sunetra was nominated to Rajya Sabha.With her recent elevation, she will initially have to lean on party seniors for guidance as she navigates the complex responsibilities of leadership.Sunetra Pawar began the week as a Rajya Sabha MP, and by its end, she has stepped into the role of deputy chief minister, taking on all her late husband’s political responsibilities—an abrupt shift made even more challenging as she continues to come to terms with her loss.Ajit Pawar was a mass leader, as reflected in the chants of “Ajit dada amar rahe” during Sunetra Pawar’s swearing-in. Being his spouse made her the most obvious choice to succeed him. However, she will now have to establish her own acceptability among the NCP cadre and ensure she carries forward the legacy of the cadre's ""dada.""The two NCP factions were reportedly set for a merger, with an announcement scheduled for February. They also contested the recent municipal corporation elections in their Pimpri-Chinchwad stronghold as allies, though unsuccessfully. Despite past divisions, the family has traditionally celebrated occasions together. Yet, NCP patriarch Sharad Pawar’s remark that he was not consulted about Sunetra Pawar’s elevation—and his daughter Supriya Sule’s decision to travel to Delhi instead of attending the swearing-in—suggests that tensions persist, adding another potential headache for Sunetra.","Sunetra Pawar is Maharashtra’s deputy chief minister, the first woman to hold the post.

Power tussle in states: Why is Congress leadership shying away from hard decisions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/power-tussle-in-states-why-is-congress-leadership-shying-away-from-hard-decisions/articleshow/127818112.cms,"‘Cordial, Constructive Discussion’ Shashi Tharoor On Meet With Rahul, Kharge Amid Rift Buzz

NEW DELHI: 2026 may see the Congress win another state. If the local body election results in Kerala are an indication to go by, the state may turn to Congress-led UDF after 10 years. So far so good. But what after that? Will Kerala go the Karnataka way for the Congress? Will the victory, if it happens, be overshadowed by factionalism and power tussle in the state unit?For quite some time now, the Congress in Kerala has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. Shashi Tharoor, who was for many years the brightest Congress star in Kerala and also a symbol of inner party democracy, has of late been a source of constant embarrassment for the grand-old party. Tharoor, whose differences with the Congress leadership have made headlines, has given the party’s rivals, especially the BJP, enough political fodder to undermine the leadership of the Gandhis.So, what did the Congress leadership do to solve this crisis? Well, nothing for almost a year. After a prolonged dilly-dally, as the election approaches, the top leadership finally gave an audience to Tharoor to send out a message that “all is well”. However, we still do not know the outcome of this truce meeting. Tharoor has now claimed that he is on “same page” with the leadership and ready to campaign for the party.Unfortunately, this dilly-dally approach of the top Congress leadership in Kerala is not an exception.When it comes to power tussles in states, the Congress high command has been found procrastinating, shying away from taking hard decisions - one way or the other. This has led to unpleasant situations and even political desertions in some cases. Several Congress leaders have left the party in the last 12 years claiming the high command did little to resolve disputes.","If local body election results in Kerala are an indication to go by, the state may turn to Congress-led UDF after 10 years.

Jhumpa Lahiri questions the mother tongue — and the need to belong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jhumpa-lahiri-questions-the-mother-tongue-and-the-need-to-belong/articleshow/127820568.cms,"Photo credit: Marco Delogu

In a literary world fixated on roots, writer and translator Jhumpa Lahiri has a confession to make: she does not believe she has a mother tongue.“I have no mother tongue...I don’t call anything my language. I never have. I’ve always felt outside of all language,” the Pulitzer Prize–winning author said Friday, during a press interaction before her session ‘After the Mother Tongue’ at the Instituto Italiano di Cultura in New Delhi. The event capped her India visit, which marked her return to a public stage in the country after 12 years at the Kolkata Literary Meet earlier in the month. Speaking at a panel, the writer indulged in a wide-ranging conversation about learning and writing in Italian, her life in Rome and the challenges of studying literature across linguistic and cultural boundaries.Lahiri, born in London to Bengali parents and raised in the US, dismantled the idea that identity must be anchored to a single native language, calling instead for linguistic fluidity, migration and creative trespass.‘The Namesake’ author, once known as the voice of the Bengali diaspora for her portraits of first- and second-generation immigrant lives, described a lifelong estrangement from the very languages that shaped her.Bengali, spoken at home by her immigrant parents, was emotionally intimate but structurally incomplete. English, meanwhile, arrived through school and the outside world and maintained its own distance as “the language those American people spoke, not us.”That double remove became, for Lahiri, not a loss but an unexpected creative condition. “This lack of a principal dominant language has opened up a different kind of space inside me to inhabit other languages,” Lahiri said. If she rejects the idea of a mother tongue, Lahiri is equally resistant to the idea that languages belong to particular people. “The most amazing thing about language is… anyone who wishes to can learn another language,” she said. “It’s an incredibly radical way to cross a boundary. I’d encourage young writers to learn other languages and resist a monolingual centre of gravity.”But she tempered that optimism with two warnings: against linguistic domination and against linguistic nationalism. She described English as a global force that can overwhelm smaller languages, while cautioning that the intertwining of language and the nation-state in projects of national identity is “very dangerous.” Writing in Italian, she said, is an act of engagement, not ownership. “I always maintain the outsider’s perspective. ”Lahiri's transition from English to Italian began around 2012. She relocated her family to Rome at that time. There, she temporarily renounced reading and writing in English to immerse herself fully in Italian. She first fell in love with the language during a 1994 trip to Florence, and later sought freedom from the ""overbearing"" perfection of her Pulitzer-winning English works. ‘The Lowland’ (2013) marked her last major work of fiction in English. Since then, she has penned several original works in Italian, including the essay collection ‘In altre parole’ (’In Other Words’, 2015), the novel ‘Dove mi trovo’ (’Whereabouts’, 2018), and the short story collection ‘Racconti romani’ (’Roman Stories’, 2022). Some are self-translated into English.Perhaps the most striking idea Lahiri offered was about “belonging”. When asked where she finds a sense of home, she pushed back on the premise. “Why is this question of belonging so important? Why can we not approach life as a positive drift, a journey, a shifting, as an evolution, as a largely nomadic experience with certain points of orientation?”Her years living and writing in Italian, she said, have been key in liberating her from the notion that ""we must belong somewhere.”Home, for her, is not tied to a nation or a tongue. “I find home in libraries. I find home by the sea. I find home with my friends, at my desk, with the people I love. I carry certain elements of home with me, like a tortoise. And sometimes home comes to me.”","Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jhumpa Lahiri spoke at the Instituto Italiano di Cultura in New Delhi.

Malaysian diaspora gears up for tryst with PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/malaysian-diaspora-gears-up-for-tryst-with-pm-modi/articleshow/127813769.cms,"PM Modi

KUALA LUMPUR: The stage is set for PM Narendra Modi to once again showcase India’s soft power on the global stage. This time round it’s Malaysia, on Feb 7, as thousands of Indian diaspora members will be waiting to see and hear Modi.Adding to the excitement is the murmur of Malaysia’s prime minister Anwar Ibrahim joining Modi at the event. For Anwar, the Thaipusam festival which is largely an occasion to assert Indians’ cultural and political identity, Modi’s visit, and address to the Indian diaspora, could all blend together to provide some sort of firm ground in changing electoral scenarios.Further, with Chinese New Year celebrations also round the corner, and the Dragon Dance as one of the elements of the cultural extravaganza, the opportunity for affirming India’s image as the unifier in the Global South is huge.Around 15,000 Indians, including ‘Malay Indians’ as PM Modi had referred to them in his last community address in 2015, and expatriates, will gather at MINES International Exhibition & Convention Centre (MIECC) in Kuala Lumpur to listen to Modi. More than 60 Indian community organizations and NGOs in Malaysia have come together to form the `Selamatdatangmodiji’ event.Talking to TOI, Nabhesh Khanna, director of MI Cultural Events, which is supervising the event, said, “The event has been conceptualised in such a way that it will highlight the unity and diversity of Indians and Malaysians; reminding that our bonds transcend boundaries and are rooted in everyday culture, lives.”Malaysia Hindu Dharma Maamandram, a Hindu NGO with 40 branches across Malaysia, has reached out to various temples in the country for participating in the grand event. Rishi Kumar Vadivelu, head of the NGO said, “Modiji has brought our culture, tradition, our roots, in the international arena. He has been promoting Thiruvalluvar, the great philosopher.”Pradip Batra, head of OFBJP in Malaysia, said, “The excitement is huge.

The penguin walked away quietly. But what was it trying to say?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-penguin-walked-away-quietly-but-what-was-it-trying-to-say/articleshow/127803414.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. The internet loves noise, but this time it fell in love with silence. A short video went viral: a lone penguin walking away from its colony, not toward the sea, not toward its companions, but straight toward the frozen mountains of Antarctica. No drama. Just a steady, deliberate walk into white nothingness. Memes followed, as they always do. Even the White House posted one where the American President escorts the penguin to Greenland. Social media crowned it the nihilist penguin . Laughter spread, but beneath it lay recognition. This penguin wasn’t protesting. It wasn’t rebelling. It wasn’t asking to be saved. It was simply walking away. And that quiet exit felt deeply familiar, especially to Gen Z—a generation tired of performing happiness, exhausted by constant comparison, crushed by the pressure to prove that life is “working out”. Somewhere inside, many whispered the same thought the penguin seemed to carry: Enough is enough. What many forgot — or never knew — was that this was not a new moment. The footage came from a 2007 documentary by Werner Herzog , titled ‘Encounters at the end of the world’. At the time, the scene passed quietly, almost uneasily, without commentary or conclusion. It was neither analysed nor celebrated. The internet was not yet ready for it. Two decades later, in an age of burnout and quiet quitting, the clip resurfaced and suddenly felt uncannily current, as though the penguin had been walking all this time to meet us here. From a Western philosophical lens, the label came easily: nihilism. The word itself comes from nihil , Latin for nothing. Nihilism argues that life has no inherent meaning, no objective values, and no moral truths beyond human invention. It emerged in modern Western thought, especially in the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche, who saw it as a dangerous vacuum left by the collapse of religion and tradition. For Nietzsche, nihilism was a crisis, not a destination. Closely allied is existentialism, articulated by thinkers such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus and Simone de Beauvoir. Existentialism claims that humans are not born with purpose; we exist first and define ourselves later through choice. Meaning is not given; it is made. Everyone saw the solitary walk of the penguin to be in synchronisation with western philosophical ideas that inherently indicated purposelessness. But here is where the Eastern lens gently interrupts the Western conclusion. Indian philosophy talks about renunciation. At first glance, nihilism and renunciation seem similar. But nihilism often carries a bleak tone, disillusionment after belief collapses. Renunciation, or vairāgya , begins not in emptiness but in insight. The world is not denied; it is understood as transient. Suffering does not arise from existence itself, but from clinging. The renunciate does not walk away in despair, but in clarity. There is freedom here, not apathy; compassion, not cynicism. Thiruvalluvar captures this radical lightness with stunning economy. In Kural 345, from the chapter on renunciation, he writes: Matrum thodarpaadu evankol pirapparukkal Utraarkku udambum migai. “For those who have renounced, even the body itself is a burden; what more could they desire?” This is where the penguin begins to look different. Perhaps it is not rejecting life. Maybe it is stepping out of the noise. Perhaps it is not a nihilist at all, but an accidental symbol of letting go.","The classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. Motivational speaker and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127804621,imgsize-31386,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/127804621.jpg"
Sunetra seen as ideal choice as she could provide a smooth transition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sunetra-seen-as-ideal-choice-as-she-could-provide-a-smooth-transition/articleshow/127810162.cms,".

Sunetra Pawar To Be Named NCP Leader, Dy CM Oath Likely Tomorrow: Chhagan Bhujbal

Ajit Pawar's wife and Rajya Sabha MP, Sunetra Pawar, is set to take over the reins of the party after his passing as she ticks the boxes of seniority, parity (with the rest of the Pawars), continuity and stability that the party wants bold and underlined.While the names of Ajit's sons Jay and Parth are also doing the rounds, what weighs things far more in Sunetra's favour is the feeling that there needs to be continuity, which the 62-year-old widow of the Maratha strongman will provide more than anyone else as she is the spouse, plus the fact that seniority considerations have to be kept in mind to some extent while picking a successor.Ajit had a team of senior politicians around him in his NCP. Praful Patel, Dilip Walse Patil, Chhagan Bhujbal, Hasan Mushrif, Sunil Tatkare, Dhananjay Munde are all politicians with experience in politics, legislature and administration. The party would accept the sons without hesitation as Parth and Jay are carriers of Ajit's name and legacy. But Sunetra's name would not require a negotiation with even the most experienced of the lot.The transition would be smooth and unquestioned, and acceptance of responsibilities would be genuine under her leadership among both seniors and juniors in NCP. Crucially, it is expected to stymie attempts to wean away a section of the outfit or some of its 40-odd MLAs either owing to injured egos or groupism or simply the promise of greater benefits and stability in other political camps.Sunetra's loss to Supriya Sule in 2024 Lok Sabha elections had rankled with Ajit, and placing her in the top position now would be one way of making amends, of assuaging sentiments of those in NCP who have a sense of hurt about that defeat, and of also making a political statement in the process.Sunetra's parity with the other seniors in the Pawar household would be another key factor. She would be able to speak to the leadership of the other faction of NCP as an equal and make acceptable decisions, including those about a merger. If, say, she decides to assert the identity and independence of the Ajit-led NCP, all forces within the party would instantly rally around her.Jay and Parth would also be able to negotiate or talk to the other faction, but Sunetra at the helm would be enough to scotch the rank and file's fears of a hasty decision taken by an impressionable person or one weighed down by thoughts of deference to elders, which is natural in a household as famously close-knit as those of the Pawars.Sunetra is the sister of former state minister and education baron Padamsinh Patil. Apart from her experience in Rajya Sabha, she has seen political activity up close all her life. She has also been engaged in social work for nearly two decades. She founded Environmental Forum of India in 2010, which works on promoting adoption of eco-friendly practices by villages and creation of eco-conscious communities.She's been a trustee of educational institution, Vidya Pratisthan in Baramati, on whose grounds Ajit's mortal remains were kept for people to pay their respects and where his last rites were carried out. The party believes that this experience in the social sector also makes her the ideal pick to lead it.","Ajit Pawar's wife and Rajya Sabha MP, Sunetra Pawar, is set to take over the reins of the party after his passing.

Cleveland Browns share heartfelt post featuring Shedeur Sanders and Todd Monken

Life changing moments have nothing to do with football

Can’t wait to see the video when Todd Monken meets Myles Garrett

There are two sides to the NFL quarterback position. Cleveland Browns longtime signal-caller Deshaun Watson, who arrived in a blockbuster trade sending Baker Mayfield to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, reportedly revealed he was baptized in Israel.Sports media personality Dov Kleiman shared on X that Watson said the experience was life changing. “I am truly in awe of this wonderful land and the wonderful people who live here.” Kleiman also wrote, “Deshaun is a devout Christian [red heart and folded hands emojis].”Now, the other side of an NFL field general. The Browns’ official X account shared a heartwarming post of QB Shedeur Sanders meeting their new head coach, Todd Monken, who was previously the Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator and worked with Lamar Jackson and others. Cleveland captions it: “it all worked out.”Monken and Sanders shake hands, then the coach pulls the signal-caller’s shoulder and says, “Hey, we tried to draft your [---] last year for God’s sake! It all worked out. You remember that right?” Sanders chuckles and responds, “That’s what I was about to tell you…” Monken shares, “Someday we’ll get a chance to talk about that.”In Sept. 2025, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that the Ravens planned to pick Shedeur Sanders in the fifth round with the No.141 pick. League sources told the NFL Insider that Sanders did not want to play alongside Lamar Jackson because he would not have a chance to play soon.Is that why he chose Cleveland? A veteran like Deshaun Watson was recovering, rookie Dillon Gabriel was on the roster, veteran Joe Flacco was playing, and Super Bowl LIX winner Kenny Pickett was traded from the Philadelphia Eagles to the Browns. Maybe. Just speculation.Anyway, how did cybercitizens react to Watson’s baptism picture and Sanders’ union with a former Baltimore coordinator? Let’s find out.“Nothing wrong with making this move in your life. It’s never too late,” wrote one X user for Watson. Another wrote a wholesome comment for the playmaker, “Whatever people think about him on the field, moments like this are personal.Faith journeys are not about headlines or teams, they are about meaning and perspective. If this experience gave Deshaun Watson peace or clarity, that matters to him. Sometimes life changing moments have nothing to do with football at all.”Watson did not play a single game in his 2025 campaign. And Kleiman reportedly shared a photo of Watson’s baptism from June 2019.ABC13 Houston reported at the time that Watson was in Israel for a week on a trip sponsored by the nonprofit group America’s Voices. While on the trip, he was baptized in the Jordan River.Watson said in a statement then: “This is a part of the world which gets a lot of attention internationally, and this is a chance for me to look beyond the headlines and learn more about the history and culture of this land.I have been blessed to visit many countries around the world, but the chance to visit the Holy Land, see the sites and meet the people of this special place, truly is a special blessing and an amazing opportunity.”Coming to Deion Sanders’ son: “I’ve never seen a backup QB get this kind of treatment,” wrote one X user after seeing a special video of backup QB Shedeur Sanders meeting the franchise’s new head coach.Another user was waiting for a video featuring Cleveland’s star defensive end Myles Garrett: “Can’t wait to see the video when he meets Myles.”A third user spoke for the 23-year-old Colorado Buffaloes former standout QB: “Its clear coach cant wait to work with Shedeur. Say what you want, but Sanders was part of why Monken wanted to come here. That aside this interaction is hilarious [laughing face emojis].”","Cleveland Browns share heartfelt post featuring Shedeur Sanders and Todd Monken.

What was the going rate for souls? What was mine worth, anyway?”The Being Mary Jane actress added, “Clearly, my feelings weren’t originating from a healthy place.

Jalen Brunson hits the 10,000 career points milestone



Jalen Brunson’s impact on the Knicks’ franchise



When Jalen Brunson stepped on the free-throw line on Friday night at Madison Square Garden, the home crowd knew a history was about to be written. And Brunson, with a flick of his wrist, sent the ball into the basket and added a prolific 10,000 career points milestone in his NBA resume.The 6’2” Knicks point guard has been rewriting every scout’s report that ever doubted his abilities. The achievement came in a match against the Portland Trail Blazers, whom the Knicks hosted at MSG. From the first quarter, where the Knicks dropped 37 points against their opponents 22, the intention was clear that the win would stay in New York. The deal was sealed in the 4th quarter when the Knicks put up 40 points on the board, almost double of Trail Blazers’ 28, and ended the match in a blowout win with 127-97.When Jalen Brunson entered the contest against the Trail Blazers on January 30th, he was short of 20 points to reach the five-figure club. But with a trademark free throw late in the third quarter, he achieved this feat.He finished the game with a team-high of 26 points, while shooting 8-of-20 from the floor and a perfect 5-of-5 from the free throw stripe. Beyond Brunson’s individual glory, the dominant win marked the Knicks’ fifth consecutive victory and has moved, and placed them to 2nd place in the Eastern Conference with a 30-18 record.Seems like Jalen Brunson’s soul-searching talk has helped the Knicks in getting their minds and bodies on the right track.Brunson’s journey from a highly-efficient secondary playmaker in Dallas to an explosive point scorer in New York has put him amongst the elite in the league. This season, he’s played in 43 games and has averaged 27.6 points, 3.1 rebounds, and 5.9 assists, with a field shooting efficiency of 47.5%.As a free against Jalen Brunson signed a 4-year $104 million contract with the Knicks in 2022.

Derrick Rose says he doesn’t want a statue after seeing Dwyane Wade’s

Keeping the Legend in the Lenses

Last Saturday, on January 24, 2026, the rafters of the United Center finally felt complete as Derrick Rose’s No. 1 jersey was raised into the Chicago skyline. Surrounded by his family and the roar of a crowd that never stopped believing in him, the moment brought a wave of emotions for Derrick Rose, who couldn’t stop the stream of tears.What often follows for a player with an illustrious and impactful career, like Derrick Rose, is the franchise building a stature in their honor, but the NBA's youngest MVP didn’t think so. In a recent sit-down on Forbes’ The Enterprise Zone, the Chicago hero made it clear that while he's honored by the love, he wants the organization to keep the bronze in the foundry.The Miami Heat built Dwyane Wade’s statue to honor his 15-year historic career with them on October 27, 2024. The statue depicted Wade’s famous, “This is my house,” gesture. But what followed upon the statue’s unveiling could become a perfect script for a stand-up special. Fans went berserk with their roasting on social media. The most common joke was that the statue looked like anyone but Dwyane Wade.Rose jokingly, upon being asked if he’d like Chacicago Bulls to build a statue for him too, said, ""No knock, D-Wade... I’m good.”Rose added, “You could do the statue of a family crest, but I don’t want no statue of myself. I feel like that’s idolizing in a way and nobody to idolize.”He explained how he doesn’t like idolization, and building a statue is a form of it. It seems like a rare stance in an era where under the spotlight matters as much as being a superstar on the court. For Rose, who grew up in Englewood and became an NBA legend, the jersey retirement wasn’t just his honour, but as he stated, “This journey was never about me. Right from the jump, it was never about me"".By turning down having a statue, Derrick Rose shows that he wants to preserve his legacy in its purest form with just memories. He might have retired without an NBA championship ring, but what he gained more beyond the court remains incomparable. Through his deep emotional commitment to the City of Chicago, Rose’s legacy lives in everyone’s heart. As a hometown hero, Derrick Rose remains everyone’s inspiration who ever thought dreams do not come true.","The Miami Heat built Dwyane Wade's statue to honor his 15-year historic career with them on October 27, 2024.

De’Andre Hunter trade framework draws mixed reactions as Kings, Cavaliers, and Lakers explore multi-team deal

Salary cap limits and future draft picks complicate De’Andre Hunter’s trade possibilities

At this year's trade deadline, the Sacramento Kings are getting ready to make some significant changes. They are also looking forward to the departure of its veterans and doing a fresh start. However, fourth-year guard Keon Ellis is now the most probable candidate to be dealt.According to reports, the Lakers and Cavaliers have explored a trade that would involve a third team, Brooklyn, and send Rui Hachimura and Dalton Knecht out of Los Angeles. The Cavaliers would trade De'Andre Hunter to Sacramento.According to Michael Scotto of HoopsHype, trade talks between the Kings and Cavaliers would send Ellis and Dennis Schröder to Cleveland. The Cavaliers would trade De'Andre Hunter to Sacramento in exchange.Scotto reported on Saturday:""Cleveland and Sacramento have discussed a framework that would send Cavaliers forward De’Andre Hunter to the Kings for Keon Ellis, Dennis Schroeder, and Dario Saric, league sources told HoopsHype. A third team could be looped in to take on Saric, and second-round draft pick compensation also could be added to the framework, sources said.”Additionally, Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com reported on the Wine & Gold Podcast:""My sources tell me that the Cavs and the Lakers have discussed a general framework surrounding De'Andre Hunter of Rui Hachimura and Dalton Knecht and then bringing in a third team.""Although the Cavaliers have emerged as a top destination, Ellis is allegedly receiving some attention on the trade market from roughly half of the league. Additionally, even though he would probably be transferred to a third team, Dario Saric is also involved.Hunter is an intriguing talent who might contribute to the Kings' victory. It is anticipated that the Kings will receive a first-round selection in exchange for the guard, as over half of the league has expressed interest in Ellis.However, the sources further said that although it would be ideal for the Kings to terminate Schröder's contract, accepting Hunter's contract is also not a pleasant scenario.The Cavaliers are past the second apron, which makes it difficult to create any transaction with these teams. Neither team can acquire several players in a trade, nor can they get more money than they put out. In addition, the Lakers are currently under $1 million from their hard cap at the first apron.Hence, as per sources, it would be simple to move during the summer or at the trade deadline the following year if they make this deal now. For the sole purpose of trading Hunter away later, Kings general manager Scott Perry may try to acquire a long wing with a history of involving other teams.Nevertheless, Kings club that isn't in a rush to be competitive would find it worthwhile to take a chance like this because Hunter on an expiring contract is more valuable than a combination of Ellis and Schröder right now.","Sacramento Kings are looking to make some significant changes.

Swifties tracked the interaction and accused her of seeking attention, sparking debate over online stalking and fan behavior. The post itself focused on Kelce’s charity work, but attention quickly shifted to Nicole’s social media activity.

Kayla Nicole swarmed by Swifties in what critics call online stalking

A single tap on Instagram was enough to reignite a familiar online storm. Kayla Nicole found herself trending again after fans noticed she had liked a post involving her ex, Travis Kelce . What began as a routine interaction quickly turned into a flashpoint, drawing intense reactions across social media and reopening long standing tensions tied to Kelce’s highly public relationship.The post itself had nothing to do with romance. Shared by Bleacher Report, it highlighted Travis and his brother Jason helping fund U.S. hockey player Laila Edwards’ family trip to Milan ahead of her Winter Olympics debut. The caption praised their generosity, calling them “two great guys that went out of their way when they didn’t have to.” Still, attention shifted away from the charitable act once screenshots showed Nicole’s verified account had liked the post.Fans protective of Travis Kelce’s relationship with Taylor Swift reacted swiftly. Screenshots spread fast, followed by harsh commentary. Some people said Nicole was just trying to get attention, while others wondered why the interaction was being made bigger in the first place. Nicole has been under a lot of online scrutiny since she broke up with Kelce in 2022, and the backlash added to that.This wasn't the first time people looked closely at what she did.People have seen past fashion posts and pop culture references as subtle digs, whether they were meant to be or not. Nicole has largely stayed silent during these moments, choosing not to respond publicly as speculation grows around her every move.The renewed focus also comes as the Kelce family continues to make headlines of their own. Travis’ mother, Donna Kelce, recently sparked conversation during interviews ahead of her appearance on The Traitors. When asked who she hoped to avoid on the show, she said, “Maybe some of my sons’ adversaries. That could either be on other teams, or it could be coaches, or it could be past girlfriends.”That remark only fueled discussion further. In today’s social media climate, even the smallest interaction can carry oversized meaning. For Nicole, a single like became another reminder that public history never fully stays in the past, especially when fans are watching every move.","Kayla Nicole faced renewed online backlash after fans noticed she liked an Instagram post involving her ex, Travis Kelce. Swifties tracked the interaction and accused her of seeking attention, sparking debate over online stalking and fan behavior. The post itself focused on Kelce’s charity work, but attention quickly shifted to Nicole's social media activity.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127830223,imgsize-61830,width-400,resizemode-4/127830223.jpg"

The Memphis Grizzlies have ruled him out with a left-elbow ulnar collateral ligament sprain, and the current expectation is that he will remain out until around mid-February 2026.His absence leaves Memphis without its main ball handler and scorer. The team will have to adjust on both ends of the floor, and there is no indication that his status will change before tip-off.The NBA injury report for January 31 lists Ja Morant as “Out” with a left-elbow UCL sprain. Memphis is not planning to activate him late and is focused on giving the injury time to heal.Player Status Injury Expected ReturnJa Morant Out Left-elbow UCL sprain Around mid-February 2026The team chose rest and rehab instead of trying to bring him back early to avoid making the injury worse.Ja Morant suffered the sprain during a practice scrimmage earlier in January. After medical tests, the Grizzlies decided he needed several weeks off.The injury followed a right calf contusion that had already forced him to miss six games earlier in the month. Memphis Grizzlies has taken a careful approach with him after several injury interruptions in recent seasons.With Ja Morant out, Memphis Grizzlies will lean more on Jaren Jackson Jr.for scoring. Ball-handling duties will be shared by Tyus Jones, Kennedy Chandler, and the rest of the guard group.The Grizzlies may play at a slower pace than usual. Morant often pushes the ball in transition and attacks the rim, and those chances are harder to create without him. Minnesota is comfortable playing in the half court with Anthony Edwards, Rudy Gobert, and Mike Conley, which could make scoring more difficult for Memphis.Ja Morant should be kept out of fantasy lineups for this game. His absence increases opportunities for Jaren Jackson Jr., Desmond Bane, and Memphis guards, but the offense may not be as productive overall.Minnesota gains an edge with Morant unavailable. The matchup could be more controlled and lower scoring than games where he is on the floor.Memphis is clearly prioritizing Morant’s health and wants him ready for the later part of the season. That approach may cost the team in the short term, but it reduces the risk of a longer absence.Also read: Is Anthony Edwards playing tonight vs Memphis Grizzlies?

Minnesota Timberwovels vs Memphis Grizzlies Game expectation (January 31, 2026)

The Minnesota Timberwolves face the Memphis Grizzlies on January 31, 2026, in a Western Conference matchup between two teams managing several injuries. Even with players unavailable on both sides, the game features enough proven talent to remain competitive.Minnesota comes in with the stronger record and a healthier core group. Memphis, meanwhile, continues to adjust its rotations because of long-term injuries. The difference in styles is clear and that is the Timberwolves rely on size and interior defense, while the Grizzlies depend heavily on guard play and pace.Minnesota is missing a few rotation players, but most of its main contributors are expected to play.• Terrence Shannon Jr. (SG) - Left foot abductor hallucis strain; expected to miss significant time.• Enrique Freeman (G-League two-way) - Ruled out without a specific designation.• Rocco Zikarsky (G-League two-way) - Also listed out on the official report.• Mike Conley (PG) - Back spasms; status depends on pregame evaluation.• Leonard Miller (F) - Dealing with back issues and could see limited minutes if active.Anthony Edwards, Rudy Gobert, and Julius Randle are all expected to suit up.If Conley is cleared, Minnesota keeps a noticeable advantage in size and overall balance.Memphis Grizzlies have dealt with injuries throughout the season, particularly in the frontcourt.• Zach Edey (C) - Stress reaction in the left ankle; no clear return date.• Brandon Clarke (F) - Grade 2 right calf strain; projected return in four to six weeks.• Ty Jerome (SG) - High-grade right calf strain; out indefinitely.• Vince Williams Jr. (SG) - Left knee soreness; not expected to play.• Santi Aldama (F) - Knee issue; often plays with managed minutes.The Grizzlies are expected to rely on Ja Morant, Jaren Jackson Jr., and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. Younger players such as Jaylen Wells and Scotty Pippen Jr. could take on larger roles depending on lineup needs.Minnesota has a slight edge in the all-time series and has performed better in recent matchups.The teams have already met once this season. Minnesota won a close game behind a 30-point effort from Anthony Edwards and a double-double from Rudy Gobert. The result reflected how the Timberwolves’ interior presence can slow Memphis’ preferred tempo.Minnesota sits in the upper half of the Western Conference with consistent production on both ends of the floor.• Anthony Edwards - About 28.9 points per game; primary scorer.• Rudy Gobert - Roughly 11.4 rebounds per game; anchors the defense.• Julius Randle - Around 5.7 assists per game; key facilitator.Minnesota’s defense remains one of its strengths. Gobert protects the rim, while Jaden McDaniels adds length on the perimeter.Memphis has slipped in the standings compared to last season, largely because of injuries and roster turnover.• Ja Morant - Drives the offense with transition scoring and pick-and-roll play.• Jaren Jackson Jr. - Provides shooting range and shot-blocking.The Grizzlies can still defend effectively when healthy, but injuries to Edey, Clarke, and Aldama have reduced frontcourt depth and contributed to more second-chance points for opponents.Gobert and Randle give Minnesota a strong presence inside. Memphis may have to rely more on outside shooting if it struggles to score in the paint.If Edwards and Donte DiVincenzo convert from long range, Memphis’ defense will need to stretch, which could open driving lanes.Memphis prefers a faster pace led by Morant. Minnesota may try to slow the game, especially if Conley is available to run the offense.• Edwards, Gobert, and Randle remain dependable fantasy options.• Conley carries some risk because of his questionable status but offers value if he plays.• Morant and Jackson Jr. remain top choices.• Caldwell-Pope and Wells gain importance if injuries lead to increased minutes.The matchup projects as physical with a moderate pace. Minnesota’s defense could influence the scoring level, particularly if the Timberwolves have their full backcourt. Minnesota enters the game as the more complete team and holds a slight health advantage. If Mike Conley plays, the Timberwolves should be in a strong position to control rebounding and tempo.Memphis will depend on Morant’s scoring and Jackson Jr.’s two-way impact to stay within reach. The contrast between Minnesota’s interior defense and Memphis’ guard-driven offense should keep the contest competitive.","The Minnesota Timberwolves face the Memphis Grizzlies on January 31, 2026.

Vernon Davis breaks silence after allegations involving pregnant woman

Vernon Davis used to be burdened with moments of playoffs and Super Bowl winning moments. This week it came up in a much different context. The charges mentioned in a criminal complaint that was recently filed have thrust the former NFL star into a negative limelight he is first speaking publicly about the matter.The charges made are grave and unproven and Davis has not been tried yet.

Career Beginnings and Real Estate Vision

Expansion in Kerala

Passion for Cars

Philosophy on Real Estate

Ventures in Entertainment

Sponsorships in Sports and Global Events

Philanthropy and Community Work





BENGALURU: From keeping accounts for his mother’s modest real estate dealings to becoming an honorary consul and one of Bengaluru’s wealthiest developers, CJ Roy’s journey is a study in foresight and timing.Roy Chiriankandath Joseph, popularly known as CJ Roy, 57, a Kerala native, born and raised in Bengaluru. He was a visionary real estate developer, entrepreneur, and philanthropist. His journey in real estate began at home, where his mother, a neighbourhood real estate agent, quietly bought 30–40 sites at a time, built houses, and sold them. Roy tracked the accounts and absorbed the workings of land transactions and cash flows — knowledge that later helped him make informed decisions, transforming parts of Bengaluru and Kerala.Although his family was based in Dubai, he chose to focus his career and investments in India.Roy had an active Instagram presence with 1.3 million followers, despite disabling the comment section. His last post was a Republic Day greeting: “A Very Happy Republic Day,” showing him smiling in a blue blazer. The post received nearly 5 lakh views. He regularly shared updates on cars, helicopters, travel, family, and real estate projects.Roy’s professional life began in 1990 with nine-to-five roles at companies such as BPL, TVS, and HP before he stepped into the realty business. The defining moment came in 2001 when most Bengaluru developers focused on central districts, while Roy saw potential in Sarjapur — then open fields with long roads, where acres were selling for about Rs 6 lakh.In 2005, he launched Confident Group. “I had enough capital to buy 150–200 acres in Sarjapur and decided to go ahead with it instead of sinking money into the CBD,” he said. Despite resistance from family and company directors, only his wife supported the move. Roy committed to building on the periphery — a gamble that paid off spectacularly.His first purchase in Kerala comprised two plots in Kakkanad. While 100 flats were designed and much was spent on roadshows, there were zero sales initially. A chance encounter in Mumbai with a TV executive led him to offer his flat as the prize for a reality show. Roy became the show’s brand ambassador, and the popularity led to flat sales soon after.Roy’s relationship with cars began in 1994 with his first vehicle — a Maruti car. Despite being dismissed by a salesman, he vowed to one day own the world’s most iconic cars. Over time, he amassed 12 Rolls-Royce cars, a Bugatti Veyron, a Koenigsegg Agera, Lamborghinis, a McLaren 720S, and a Mercedes-Maybach. Roy even repurchased his first Maruti, offering Rs 10 lakh to trace it.“Building a home is every man’s dream. So our business is in selling dreams,” Confident Group chairman CJ Roy once said.Confident Group flourished in Kerala, catering to luxury and middle-income housing across Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur, Kozhikode, and Kottayam.Roy became a household name in Kerala through his entry into the entertainment industry. As early as 2007, he sponsored an apartment worth Rs 1 crore for the winner of a reality music show on Asianet. Since then, Confident Group regularly sponsored winners of reality shows, including a reward of Rs 10 lakh for the winner of the Bigg Boss Malayalam series this year.He also funded over 10 films in Malayalam and Kannada, including Casanovva, Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham, Mei Hoom Moosa, Rangappa Hogbitna, Krazy Loka, and Radhana Ganda.The group sponsored international sports teams, including the West Indies cricket team (2013–14) and the Sri Lankan cricket team during the 2016 ICC World Cup. In 2022, Roy’s group also organised global movie awards in Dubai, Singapore, and India, further formalising its presence in the entertainment sector.Beyond business, Roy supported charity initiatives and cultural events and was active in rebuilding houses after the devastating 2018 Kerala floods. He also showcased his lifestyle, including high-end cars and chopper rides, on social media.","Roy Chiriankandath Joseph, popularly known as CJ Roy, 57, a Kerala native, born and raised in Bengaluru.

NEW DELHI: A 55-year-old man and his wife were found dead at their residence in north-east Delhi’s Jyoti Nagar on Thursday, in what police suspect is a case of suicide by the couple.A note found at their home hinted at financial distress, brought by the burden of mounting loans, police said. Their two sons were not at home when the couple died. “The sons, aged 25-26, went out for dinner, and when they came back after an hour, they found the parents unconscious and called the cops,” a police source said.A call regarding a suspected suicide reached police around 12.05 am on Friday.

Police said that the couple used to run a small factory earlier, but that was shut down, leaving them without any stable source of income. Their children were also engaged in small jobs to support the household, but the family continued to struggle financially.Proceedings under Section 194 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) were initiated in the case. Section 194 deals with suicide investigation and reporting.Police said further investigation was under way, and the statements of family members and neighbours were being recorded.","A 55-year-old man and his wife were found dead at their residence in north-east Delhi’s Jyoti Nagar on Thursday.

Main factors in the Portland Trail Blazers vs New York Knicks game (January 30, 2026)

What to expect on Blazers vs Knicks Jan 30

Thein New York with both teams in very different situations. Portland is trying to stop a three-game slide while dealing with several injuries. New York is coming in on a four-game winning streak and has most of its main players available.This game is likely to be decided by depth and basic execution. Portland is missing key guards and needs replacement players to handle the ball and score. New York’s job is not as difficult. They need to defend well, take care of the ball, and use its size advantage.The game will be played at Madison Square Garden, where the Knicks have been strong this season. New York already beat Portland once earlier in the year, and the Blazers are even more short-handed for this meeting.Portland Trail Blazers are 23-25 and have lost three straight. Head coach Chauncey Billups has to rely on a thin rotation.• Damian Lillard - left Achilles management• Scoot Henderson - left knee tear, out for weeks• Matisse Thybulle - right knee tendinopathy• Kris Murray - undisclosed issue• Blake Wesley - sidelined• Duop Reath - right foot stress fracture• Deni Avdija - low back strain, around 25 points and 7 rebounds per game• Robert Williams III - knee managementIf Avdija cannot play, Portland will depend more on Shaedon Sharpe for scoring and on Jerami Grant for defense and secondary offense.Without Lillard and Henderson, Portland lacks steady ball handling. That has led to many turnovers this season.New York Knicks are 29-18 and has won four in a row.• Josh Hart - ankle soreness• Miles McBride - ankle management• Jalen Brunson - around 26 points and 6 assists per game• Karl-Anthony Towns - about 20 points and 11 rebounds• Mikal Bridges• OG Anunoby - around 16 points and 5.4 reboundsIf Hart or McBride sits, Brunson will handle the ball more often, with Bridges and Anunoby helping to create plays.These teams have met 126 times in the regular season. Portland leads the series 70-56. New York won the first meeting this season 123-114 on January 11, 2026. In that game, Brunson and Towns scored more than 40 points combined, and Portland struggled with turnovers.Portland now enters the rematch with fewer healthy guards than it had in that loss.Portland’s last few games include losses by scores of 111-115 and 94-102. The team averages about 16.1 turnovers per game, one of the highest marks in the league.New York has won games by wide margins during its streak, including 119-92 and 103-87. The Knicks have controlled rebounds and limited easy fast-break chances for opponents. Towns anchors the middle, and the wings cover ground on defense. This sets up a simple contrast: Portland must avoid mistakes, while New York looks to force them.Portland needs reliable offense without its top two guards. Sharpe has to score efficiently, Grant has to defend without fouling, and Avdija, if he plays, has to contribute on both ends.New York needs steady guard play if Hart or McBride cannot go. Brunson will see more pressure, so wing support is important. Turnovers will likely decide the pace. If Portland protects the ball, the game can stay close. If New York forces early mistakes, it can build a quick lead.This matchup favors New York. The Knicks are healthier, at home, and have already beaten this opponent once this season. Avdija’s status is the biggest variable. If he plays well, Portland can stay competitive. If he is out, New York should control rebounds, limit mistakes, and manage the game from start to finish.For Portland, the path is simple and that is fewer turnovers and balanced scoring. For New York, it is strong defense, good rebounding, and letting its main players carry the offense.","Portland Trail Blazers are 23-25 and have lost three straight.

MELBOURNE: What can’t Novak Djokovic do? The question no longer seeks an answer. At almost 39, the 24-time Major champion has reached a record-extending 38th Grand Slam final. Back in a Major title round for the first time since Wimbledon 2024, the Serbian earned his place by defeating two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner, whose game is a mirror image of his, only on younger legs. Djokovic did it not by dominating the numbers, but by displaying a mentality tougher than Kevlar, the heat-resistant polymer.Nearly every statistic from the Australian Open semifinal that finished in the wee hours of Saturday, favoured Sinner, including total points won, 152 to 140. All except the one category that mattered most, break points saved. Djokovic fought off 16 of 18, with first serve after first serve, including a flawless eight of eight in the deciding fifth set.That, precisely, is where the ten-time Melbourne Park champion flexed his unmatched mental strength.Djokovic knows that when he faces the 22-year-old world No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz in Sunday’s final, he will need to summon the same force again. The Serbian is unbeaten in 10 previous Australian Open finals and is chasing a historic 25th Grand Slam title. At 38 years and 255 days, a victory would make Djokovic the oldest men’s singles champion of the Open Era.Alcaraz, 22 years and 272 days, is aiming to lift the trophy in Melbourne for the first time and become the youngest man in history to complete a career Grand Slam, breaking an 87-year-old record held by Don Budge.When they meet for the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup on Sunday, it will mark the 10th exchange of their intense rivalry. Djokovic holds a 5-4 edge in the head-to-head, having beaten the Spaniard in the goldmedal match at the Paris Olympics and in the quarterfinals here last year. Alcaraz, however, authored a masterclass in the US Open semifinals, their most recent contest.Djokovic, who made the semis of all four majors last year, asked himself some tough questions in the off-season. “When I started my preparations for the new season,” he said, “I asked myself what is it that I’m looking for? I was imagining playing against Jannik and Carlos at the final stages of Grand Slams this year and really giving it all that I have.” The vision took physical form on Rod Laver Arena, where Djokovic snapped a five-match losing streak against the Italian.Like Djokovic, Alcaraz has never been shy about his ambitions, about breaking records and owning his path. In this case, that path leads toward a career Grand Slam. Sunday’s final becomes more than a contest for a trophy.","Novak Djokovic will face Carlos Alcaraz in Sunday's Australian Open final.

NEW DELHI: The sports ministry has issued a show-cause notice to the Equestrian Federation of India (EFI) over governance failures and factionalism that it said affected the federation’s functioning and hurt the future of rider athletes. TOI had first reported that sexual harassment accused Col (retd) Tarsem Singh Warraich had travelled with the country’s Tent Pegging team as manager-cum-coach for the World Cup qualifiers in Jordan, while out on bail.While taking a dim view of EFI executive committee member Warraich’s presence with the four-member Indian team in Amman for the International Tent Pegging WC qualifiers, the ministry noted that the Delhi high court and the court-appointed observer, Justice (retd) Najmi Waziri, repeatedly highlighted that the absence of a duly elected body severely affected the federation’s governance and the interests of athletes.The ministry stated that the international federation, FEI, also warned of possible disaffiliation, resulting in the athletes’ loss.The ministry asked the EFI, presently run by interim president Col (retd) Jagat Singh and secretary general Col (retd) Jaiveer Singh, to explain within 15 days why appropriate action under provisions of the national sports code should not be taken against the Army-run federation for its acts of omission.The ministry also sought a separate explanation from the EFI over Warraich’s selection for the event at a time when the EC member was out on bail in the molestation case.“The recent issues pertaining to the selection of athletes for the Asian Youth Games demonstrates that the malfunctioning of EFI is now explicitly hurting the interest of athletes and is resulting in potential embarrassment for the country on the world stage,” the ministry stated in its four-page show-cause notice, a copy of which is with TOI.“Serious disputes persist in relation to almost every aspect of the functioning of EFI, including discrepancies with respect to its membership. It has been noticed that EFI did not publish the annual calendar for 2025 for competitions, along with the national championships for year 2025 till date. The lapses on the part of EFI related to non-utilisation of ACTC budget in previous year and current year; lack of empaneled coaches and support staff; non-submission of any concrete plan for upcoming Asian Games and not publishing of selection policy for Asian Games, have been noticed. These lapses demonstrate governance failure on part of EFI,” the ministry said.It highlighted a Delhi HC order dated Dec 23, 2025, where the court observed that serious disputes persisted in relation to almost every aspect of the functioning and the present state of affairs of the EFI, including discrepancies with respect to its membership.“Over the years, the EFI has granted direct membership to several individuals, clubs, and units of the Indian Army, including dog units, supply depots, mechanised transport battalions etc. Such inclusion appears to have been undertaken with a view to maintaining majority voting strength and effective control of the EFI. A substantial portion of the EFI's membership comprises officers or clubs affiliated with the Indian Army,” the court observed.",The sports ministry has issued a show-cause notice to the Equestrian Federation of India (EFI) over governance failures and factionalism. The ministry asked the EFI to explain within 15 days why appropriate action under provisions of the national sports code should not be taken against the Army-run federation for its acts of omission.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127833339,imgsize-10510,width-400,resizemode-4/efi-0102-sd.jpg"

Paul George explains suspension, admits mistake while seeking treatment for mental health issue

Joel Embiid backs Sixers as Paul George’s suspension puts playoff momentum on hold

The NBA announced today that forward Paul George of the Philadelphia 76ers would serve a 25-game unpaid suspension. He reportedly breached the NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug Program. The 76ers vs. the New Orleans Pelicans game at Xfinity Mobile Arena will mark the start of George's suspension.Additionally, he will lose around $11.7 million of his $51.7 million salary due to the ban, or roughly $469,691.72 for each of the 25 games he misses. Moreover, as part of George's suspension, Philadelphia will avoid paying more than $5 million in luxury taxes, according to ESPN's Bobby Marks.The Philadelphia 76ers forward Paul George recently received a 25-game suspension from the NBA on Saturday for breaking the league's anti-drug policy. The NBA did not reveal the type of infraction or the substance involved, though.According to the guidelines of the NBA Players Association agreement, George's 25-game suspension suggests that this was his first infraction. Meanwhile, in a statement to ESPN, he claimed that he took ""improper medication"" by mistake to treat his mental illness.As per Shams Charania of ESPN, George said:""Over the past few years, I've discussed the importance of mental health, and in the course of recently seeking treatment for an issue of my own, I made the mistake of taking an improper medication..”He continued:""I take full responsibility for my actions and apologize to the Sixers organization, my teammates and the Philly fans for my poor decision making during this process. I am focused on using this time to make sure that my mind and body are in the best condition to help the team when I return.""George's suspension will start on Saturday night. The 76ers will have ten regular-season games left when he is eligible to return, which is on March 25 at home against the Chicago Bulls.In 17 games this season, George, Joel Embiid, and Tyrese Maxey, have played 365 minutes together, outscoring opponents by more than 7 points per 100 possessions. Embiid told reporters following Thursday's victory over Sacramento:""Obviously, we've been ducking the tax the last couple of years, so hopefully we keep the same team… I love all the guys that are here. I think we got a shot. I don't know what they're going to do, but I hope that at least we got a chance to just go out and compete because we got a good group of guys in this locker room, and the vibes are great.""For the 76ers, who are presently in sixth place in the Eastern Conference, George has averaged 16 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 3.7 assists in 27 games this season. With him scoring 32 points in Tuesday's victory over the Milwaukee Bucks, Philadelphia has won back-to-back games.In 2024, George agreed to a four-year, $212 million contract to join the 76ers as a free agent. Due to a knee injury, he was only able to play in 41 games the previous season and missed the beginning of the 2025 campaign. Meanwhile, he can still make a comeback for the last 10 games of the regular season, starting on March 25 against the Chicago Bulls.","Philadelphia 76ers forward Paul George received a 25-game suspension from the NBA on Saturday for breaking the league's anti-drug policy.

Sanju Samson headache for Team India | Is Ishan Kishan the right choice?

Thiruvananthapuram: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor noted that the Indian batter Sanju Samson is out of luck after the right-hander faced another setback, scoring just 6 runs in the high-scoring India vs New Zealand 5th T20I on Saturday. He also lauded Ishan Kishan for his thunderous 42-ball century that helped India post a massive 271-run first-innings total.Sanju Samson's place in the playing 11 for the upcoming ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026 has been in question, given the batter has been in a poor run of form of late. In the five-match T20I series against New Zealand, Samson could only manage 46 runs at an average of 9.20. His scores in the series read: 10, 6, 0, 24 and 6.Speaking to ANI after the Thiruvananthapuram match, Shashi Tharoor said Sanju Samson appears out of form, while praising India's performance against New Zealand and expressing confidence in the team's readiness for the T20 World Cup.He also lauded Ishan Kishan's brilliant form and described the match as an exciting spectacle.""He's just out of luck it seems.

India posted a massive 271/5 after opting to bat, with Ishan Kishan sharing a 137-run partnership with Suryakumar.Chasing 272, New Zealand fought back through Finn Allen's explosive 80 off 38 balls, but lost momentum as Arshdeep and Axar Patel (3/33 in 4 overs) struck at regular intervals.

MUMBAI: Some players in domestic cricket tend to raise their game when playing a top team like Mumbai. Divij Mehra is one of them. In Jan 2023, at the Arun Jaitely Stadium in the capital, the 23-year-old fast bowler, moving the ball around menacingly at military medium-pace, bowled a devastating spell of five for 30 in 13 overs in the second innings to fashion Delhi’s eight-wicket win over Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy . It was the first time that Delhi had beaten Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy in more than four decades.Amongst Mehra’s victims during his maiden five-wicket haul that time were domestic run-machine Sarfaraz Khan, Prithvi Shaw, who smashed a triple hundred against Assam in the same same 2022-23 Ranji Trophy season, Musheer Khan, Armaan Jaffer and Mohit Avasthi.Three years later, Mehra, with his career wrecked by injuries in between, took just his second five wicket-haul in first-class cricket, and that too came against Mumbai, triggering his side’s superb fight back.On Saturday, Mehra, bowling his heart out, took five for 64 in 31 overs to restrict Mumbai to 317 on Day Three of their last Ranji Trophy league match.Injuries have meant that Mehra was playing just his second Ranji match this season. “I was injured for the last few years after taking that five-for against Mumbai, so it felt very good to have contributed. I had struck a good rhythm in my last match against Chhattisgarh, and was just looking to stick to my strengths,” Mehra told reporters after the day’s play.A couple of years back, a heel injury robbed of a chance to play in the IPL for Punjab Kings. “I had a spur in my heel my (landing foot), so I had to get that bone removed. I was in the Punjab Kings camp, but due to the injury, I couldn’t play a single match. I spent the next 1.5 years recovering from that injury. After that, I played a match against Madhya Pradesh, but hurt my hip flexor. So, my next two seasons went on the sidelines only, recovering from injuries. I was feeling very bad sitting at home. If I had played in those two seasons, I would’ve been somewhere else,” Mehra rued.The young pacer has benefited a lot from the advice he received recently from India and Delhi’s veteran pacer Ishant Sharma “I spent a lot of time with Ishant (Sharma) bhaiya in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. He has helped in setting my routine and the areas I have to work on before the next season. He has told me about the kind of training I have to go through and what my schedule should be like as a fast bowler,” Mehra said.Both Ishant and India’s Test vice-captain Rishabh Pant, who led Delhi for a few matches this season, passed on some useful tips to the fast bowler. Not mincing his words, Ishant even told the youngster that he needed to pull up his socks in order to be a better bowler in white-ball cricket.“They both spoke with me in detail and told me that whatever I am doing is not enough in white-ball cricket. There are a lot of areas to work upon. Ishant bhaiya spoke with me sternly after one match ki dekh bhai itne se nahi chalega (this isn’t enough). He made me realise things which I was not able to do by myself. Rishabh bhaiya said that I bowl in right areas but I will have to work on my pace and variation,” Mehra said.Soon after taking Avasthi’s wicket to complete his five-for, an emotional-looking Mehra thumped the BKC turf, looking overcome with emotions. “I became a bit emotional, because before this season began, I had told my father that ‘We are playing against Mumbai again. I will try to repeat that (five-wicket haul) feat. For the whole season, I was trying to make a comeback into the Delhi team, and played all the matches of the Delhi Under-23 team. With our senior players away, I got an opportunity to play in the last two matches. So, it felt good to contribute,” Mehra said.“After making a comeback this year, I’m feeling better. My target was to play all the matches this season, and I’ve done that,” he added.“It’s special to take a five-for against Mumbai in Mumbai. Even if my next five-wicket haul comes against Mumbai, I’ll be very happy, because it’s a big team. The way it plays as a team, for each other is something that our inexperienced team can learn from. All of Mumbai’s batters are good. On another day, they could have hammered me. The wicket was helping me in the morning and evening,” Mehra concluded.",Divij Mehra took five for 64 in 31 overs to restrict Mumbai to 317 on Day Three of their last Ranji Trophy league match. Mehra was playing just his second Ranji match this season. The 23-year-old has benefited a lot from the advice he received recently from India and Delhi’s veteran pacer Ishant Sharma.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127833110,imgsize-45076,width-400,resizemode-4/divij-mehra-0102-sd.jpg"

In Yes Minister, when Jim Hacker finds out that Italian terrorists have access to British-made weapons, Sir Humphrey Appleby tries to mollify him by pointing out it’s not their department’s problem. British weapons in the hands of foreign terrorists were outside the Ministry of Administrative Affairs’ jurisdiction. Probably a Defence Ministry problem, or a Foreign Office problem, the unflappable bureaucrat points out, before a beleaguered Hacker hits back: “I am talking about good and evil.” This leads Sir Humphrey to point out that made it a “Church of England” problem.That quip, while hilarious, stands the test of time, because knowing the difference between good and evil is a heavy cross to bear for an institution created by a megalomaniac king who wanted a divorce.Now, the Church is in the news for getting its female Archbishop of Canterbury for the first time in its nearly 500-year-old history. In classic ecumenical tradition, her predecessor had to resign over an abuse scandal involving hundreds of boys. But why does England have a separate Church?It begins, inevitably, with Henry VIII, who married Catherine but couldn’t produce a male heir. The Pope refused to annul the marriage because Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor whose armies effectively controlled Rome — a man at whose snook the Pope could ill afford to cock.So, Henry decided it was time to do a Thanos and take matters into his own hands.The English Reformation followed. In 1534 Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, one of the first instances of a government nationalising a foreign institution, which in this case was Roman Catholicism.From that moment on, the CoE was in the thick of things. Under James I and Charles I, it saw a fight between the clergy who wanted to go back to the Puritan basics and the royalists who wanted the pageantry and theatrics. Their fight was one of the inspirations for the High Sparrow arc in Game of Thrones, just like the Red Wedding was inspired by the Battle of the Roses.The Puritans won briefly.During the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell put a break on the monarchy, named himself Lord Protector and banned all things fun, which instantly made the British nostalgic for the monarchy. During Cromwell’s time, the episcopal Church was effectively outlawed, and when Cromwell’s nepo kid failed to hold on to power, the church and crown returned with a vengeance.But the moment that really earned the Church its liturgical stripes was two books: the Book of Common Prayer and the King James Version of the Bible.In 1549, Archbishop Thomas Cranmer produced the first edition of the Book of Common Prayer. Before this, English worship followed Roman Catholic rites in Latin. Cranmer translated them into English and standardised them across the kingdom.This was the moment England became liturgically independent, taking Catholic structure and making it British, the theological equivalent of chicken tikka masala: foreign in origin but completely British.The Book of Common Prayer combined Protestant theology with Catholic ceremony to give a book whose phrases are still spoken across the world by English speakers, who might not be believers:The most famous is obviously peace in our time, which was uttered by Neville Chamberlain after the ill-fated Munich Agreement.Then came the King James Bible, which in time would become the most published book in the world, competing with the Little Red Book, Harry Potter and Don Quixote.Those two books gave England a way to worship independently of Rome while preserving much of the Catholic structure in English form.The CoE retained many of the traditions.Bishops still stood in a lineage traced back to the apostles. Baptism and Eucharist remained central. Vestments, altars, kneeling, and liturgical seasons stayed. The Mass was not reinterpreted. Cranmer rejected transubstantiation (bread and wine becoming blood and body) but preserved Communion as a sacred ritual. The choreography remained Catholic. The theology shifted Protestant. And some things were still hushed up.This hybrid identity became the Anglican formula: Catholic structure plus Protestant doctrine.Bishops, creeds, and hierarchy stayed. Papal supremacy and indulgences were swept under the rug.In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Church didn’t stand still. A religious revival led by preachers like John Wesley pushed the idea that faith should be personal and emotional, not just ceremonial. This movement energised ordinary believers and eventually gave rise to Methodism. A few decades later, another group inside the Church went in the opposite direction. The Oxford Movement argued that Anglicanism should reclaim its older Catholic-style rituals, emphasising tradition, ceremony, and sacred continuity.At the same time, the Church remained tightly bound to the British state. Bishops sat in Parliament, monarchs ruled as heads of the Church, and political leaders were expected to belong to it. Religion was not just private belief. It was built into the machinery of government.The 20th century dismantled that certainty. Conservatives accused secularism of creeping in. The British Empire slowly faded and the Church adapted. In 1994, women were ordained priests. By 2015, women bishops were approved. The LGBT+ movement remains a question, though. Priests are not allowed to solemnise same-sex marriages, but same-sex couples can receive prayers of blessing. Abuse scandals continued to expose institutional failures.Into this turbulence steps Sarah Mullally, the first woman to hold the office in nearly 1,400 years. Her background as a nurse and administrator suggests a leader shaped as much by systems management as theology.The appointment also highlights England’s constitutional theatre. The archbishop is formally appointed by King Charles III, relayed through Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has no theological role whatsoever. An atheist head of government advising a Christian monarch on a church appointment is the perfect embodiment of British satire.Reactions, as usual, were split. Many in Britain celebrated the progressive milestone. Conservative Anglican leaders around the world condemned it. The Vatican – which still doesn’t ordain female priests – put out a bland statement. The kind you give when you see your colleague get promoted.For Sarah Mullally, symbolism is the easy part. Governance is harder. She inherits a church facing three blunt pressures: decline, division, and credibility. Attendance continues to fall in an increasingly secular Britain, leaving the Church culturally visible but spiritually fragile. Internally, evangelical conservatives, Anglo-Catholic traditionalists, and liberal reformers coexist in permanent tension over gender, sexuality, and doctrine. Externally, safeguarding scandals have eroded moral authority and public trust.Perhaps the situation was best summed up by a septuagenarian Canterbury tour guide on her predecessors and his expectations: “Some of them have been very good, some of them have been pretty bad. Some of them have been very contentious, and some of them ended up murdered. I hope it doesn't happen to this one.” As British a sentiment as one can get.Of course, Henry VIII – based on what we know about him – would have been horrified knowing that a woman was now in charge of the Church he had created. Sir Humphrey would probably nod and say that he had always backed having a woman in charge. Or at least, an inter-departmental committee backed the general idea. Hacker would probably wonder if it could get him re-elected.All things considered, it’s hard not to smirk at the bathetic irony: an institution born because a man wanted to divorce his wife is now being led by a woman who will head one of the most influential Christian denominations in the world.","The Church is in the news for getting its female Archbishop of Canterbury for the first time in its nearly 500-year-old history.

Rwandan Archbishop Laurent Mbanda , chairman of GAFCON’s primates council, echoed this divide by asserting that Mullally’s support for same-sex marriage blessings, a position held by some provinces and her gender make it problematic for her to serve as a symbolic “first among equals” for Anglicans worldwide.

In Nigeria and other conservative provinces, some Anglican leaders have said the Church’s constitutional practice, which traditionally did not allow women to serve as bishops, is being compromised and that the Communion’s unity is at risk. Public discussions in social platforms show that some conservative congregants interpret the appointment as part of a broader ideological shift that undermines historic doctrine.

openly welcomed the appointment and expressed eagerness to work with Mullally in advancing the mission of the global Church, signalling that not all southern provinces share the same opposition. Likewise, across social platforms and smaller diocesan networks, many Anglicans shared mixed reactions not just based on gender but reflecting hopes for new approaches to pastoral care, inclusion, and maintaining communion amid diversity.

Looking ahead: The future of Anglican leadership







On January 28, 2026, Dame Sarah Mullally was officially confirmed as the first female Archbishop of Canterbury, marking a watershed moment in the 1,400-year history of the Church of England and capturing global attention across the Anglican Communion, whose members span more than 165 countries. Her confirmation ceremony at St Paul’s Cathedral in London, an ancient and legal ecclesiastical rite, was both celebratory and symbolic. Bells rang as she took on the role of spiritual leader once held only by men and her pledge to champion unity and pastoral care resonated with many observers.However, while her appointment represents a historic advance in gender equality within global Christianity, it also exposed deep fractures within the worldwide Anglican Communion, from liberal provinces that celebrated the milestone to conservative branches that raised profound theological objections.In many parts of the Anglican world, Mullally’s appointment was welcomed as a long-overdue step toward equality and inclusion. Clergy and lay leaders from more progressive provinces applauded the Church of England for breaking the “stained-glass ceiling” and demonstrating that women can occupy the highest offices of spiritual leadership.Supporters point out that the Church of England first ordained female priests in 1994 and consecrated its first female bishop in 2015, a gradual arc of inclusion now culminating in Mullally’s leadership.Many advocates see her role as evidence that long-standing gender norms in church leadership are being reexamined and transformed.Even within traditionally conservative contexts, there were voices of hopeful affirmation. For example, Bishop Emily Onyango of Kenya argued that the appointment signaled a new dawn for the Church and called for peace and reconciliation across the Communion.Yet the reactions have not been universally positive:The Anglican Communion with roughly 100 million members globally has long struggled with internal theological disputes, especially on the status of women and LGBTQ+ inclusion. Mullally’s installation has brought these debates to the fore once again.Some observers say the appointment’s reaction illustrates how geographically and culturally diverse the Communion has become. In Western and Northern provinces, there is substantial support for expanding gender roles and ecclesiastical authority to women. In many African and Asian provinces, however, traditional interpretations of Scripture and ecclesial leadership still dominate.While the Archbishop of Canterbury is not a formal hierarchical head of the Communion, the global body has no central authority akin to the Pope in Catholicism, the role is widely regarded as a symbolic spiritual leader. That symbolic function is precisely what critics argue is now jeopardised by such a polarising appointment.Despite the disagreements, there are influential Anglican voices urging a path forward grounded in mutual respect and listening:As Dame Sarah Mullally prepares for her formal enthronement at Canterbury Cathedral in March 2026, the global Anglican Communion remains deeply engaged in its internal discourse over leadership, doctrine and identity. Her leadership will test whether the Anglican Communion, a body inherently broad and diverse, can embrace plurality without splintering further or whether her appointment will accelerate conversations about new structures for global Anglican unity.What is clear from the varied reactions, from jubilant progressives to worried conservatives, is that this historic moment has redefined conversations about faith, authority, and tradition across continents, cultures and congregations alike. The varied global response to Mullally’s appointment goes beyond church politics. It reflects wider societal discussions about gender equality in leadership roles, the interpretation of religious tradition in the modern age and how global institutions balance diversity with unity.As one member put it online, the appointment is “history in the making”, not just for the Church of England but for a global community wrestling with change.","Conservative Anglican groups have expressed strong objections to Mullally’s leadership, not only because she is a woman but also because of broader concerns over theological direction and biblical interpretation.

Expanding cycling culture in the UAE



UAE traffic and public engagement in cycling







Dubai’s vibrant cycling scene is once again in the spotlight as the Al Salam Cycling Championship continues its tenth season with high-stakes desert races, attracting top cyclists, elite competitors and enthusiastic spectators to the iconic Al Marmoom Reserve in the Saih Al Salam area this weekend. Under the patronage and directives of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, the championship has evolved into one of the most exciting and inclusive sporting events in the region.The weekend’s action kicked off on Saturday, January 31, 2025, with the Desert Race for Women, covering a challenging 20 km course designed to test endurance, strategy and resilience across a rugged desert terrain. The event featured two categories, one for Emirati women and another open to all nationalities, highlighting the inclusive spirit of the championship and providing a platform for female cyclists to shine on one of Dubai’s most demanding outdoor stages.On Sunday, February 1, the focus shifts to the men’s desert race, a 52 km showdown that includes special cash-prize challenges for standout performances. This staging marks the fourth and fifth rounds of the Al Salam Championship’s tenth edition, following earlier highlights such as the Security and Safety Race, organised in cooperation with Dubai Police and tailored for Emirati cyclists and the Ruler of Dubai Court Race, a high-profile event that drew elite professional riders from around the world.A significant talking point this year is the AED 455,000 total prize pool for the desert races, the largest ever for desert cycling competitions in the region. This exceptional prize money underscores the event’s growing prestige and its ability to attract a high calibre of participants from both local and international cycling circuits. Riders are urged to equip themselves fully. Helmets, goggles and essential gear are mandatory, given the demanding nature of the desert course, which features varied terrain and environmental challenges that test physical stamina and technical skill.The prominence of the desert races follows a series of competitive encounters that have already taken place in the championship calendar. Earlier this month, the championship staged a women’s race at Al Marmoom Reserve that drew some of the world’s top female cyclists, delivering thrilling head-to-head competition and showcasing world-class athleticism on UAE soil.The Al Salam Cycling Championship, now in its tenth edition, began in late 2025 and has since become a fixture in the UAE’s sports calendar, blending elite competition with community engagement. The season kicked off with the Emirati Men’s Amateur Race in December 2025, followed by the Elite Ruler’s Court Race in January 2026, both of which were organised with strong backing from local authorities and cycling federations.Earlier rounds also saw leading professional cyclists compete under the watchful eyes of dignitaries, including Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who has consistently emphasised the role of sport in fostering healthy lifestyles, unity, and global sporting excellence. At the Elite Race, held in January, His Highness was present to witness key competitive moments, reinforcing the event’s significance as a platform for both elite sport and community participation.The Al Salam Championship is more than a series of races; it is part of a broader movement to embed cycling as a popular, accessible sport across the UAE. Over the past decade, the event has helped inspire thousands of residents and visitors to embrace cycling, whether as competitive athletes or recreational enthusiasts exploring Dubai’s scenic routes and desert landscapes. Initiatives linked to the championship, such as community rides, photography contests (in partnership with the Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum International Photography Award), and inclusive race categories for different age groups and skill levels, reflect a strategic push to broaden the sport’s appeal.Cycling aficionados and athletes alike view Al Marmoom Reserve as a natural hub for endurance sports, with its varied terrain and expansive desert setting offering an ideal backdrop for both competitive and recreational cycling. Local authorities have also leveraged this interest to expand cycling infrastructure, promote safe riding culture, and position Dubai as a global cycling-friendly destination.With the championship’s popular appeal comes practical considerations for city residents and visitors. In past years, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has issued special advisories ahead of major races, including temporary road closures and traffic adjustments to ensure safety and smooth conduct of events linked to the Al Salam Cycling Championship and related cycling festivals. These measures reflect the high profile of cycling events in Dubai and their impact on urban mobility planning during peak weekends.Athletes competing in the desert races this weekend are not just racing for prize money; they are contributing to a larger narrative of sporting excellence, outdoor adventure and community pride that reflects the UAE’s broader ambitions in health, sports participation and international sports tourism. Public engagement has been strong, with large numbers of spectators and supporters attending the races, sharing social media content from the event sites, and following live updates that celebrate athletic achievement, community spirit, and cultural vibrancy. The championship’s blend of elite competition and inclusive participation continues to resonate with audiences across the UAE and internationally.As the tenth season progresses, attention will soon turn to future stages of the Al Salam Cycling Championship, including any additional invitational races, community challenges and potential year-end events that cap off Dubai’s rich calendar of cycling activities. With strong support from national and local institutions (including the Dubai Sports Council, UAE Cycling Federation and other strategic partners) the championship is poised to maintain its momentum and grow its legacy as a premier cycling event in the Middle East.","Dubai’s vibrant cycling scene is once again in the spotlight as the Al Salam Cycling Championship continues its tenth season with high-stakes desert races.

Australia's heatwave pushes Victoria into days of extreme heat



Bushfires burn across Victoria as temperatures shatter records







A record-breaking heatwave has been gripping Australia for days now, and still temperatures have climbed to levels that feel almost unreal even by Australian standards. The heat that doesn’t just make headlines, but leaves scars.Australia is no stranger to heat; people expect it, plan for it, and complain about it, as bushfires are flaring. Thousands of homes have gone dark for many communities; it feels uncomfortably familiar. This has been like a warning heard before, but maybe not fully absorbed. Experts say this heatwave is among the worst seen in decades. Some compare it to moments etched deeply into Australia’s memory. As reported by The Bureau of Meteorology the heat is coming from a very large hot air mass that first built up in Western Australia’s interior and then moved eastward. Emergency services are stretched, hospitals see heat stress cases rise, and infrastructure strains reveal vulnerabilities across cities and remote regions.By Wednesday, parts of southeast Australia were entering the fifth straight day of severe to intense heat. Victoria, the country’s second-most populous state, has been hit particularly hard. Emergency officials say the heatwave is the worst the state has seen since the devastating Black Saturday bushfires of 2009, when 173 people lost their lives.“We are now into day five,” said Victoria’s Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch. And it appears the situation isn’t easing quickly. Authorities expect up to eight consecutive days of severe to extreme heat. That’s a long time to stay alert and exhausted.Extreme heat does more than scorch landscapes but it quietly stresses infrastructure. At its peak, power outages affected around 105,000 properties across Victoria. By Wednesday, that number had dropped to roughly 11,000, but the pressure remains. High demand for cooling systems pushes ricity networks close to their limits. For families without power, the heat feels heavier.Firefighters have been battling multiple major bushfires across Victoria. At least six large fires were active, with three reportedly out of control. One of the most serious blazes is burning near the Carlisle River in the Otways region. More than 11,000 hectares have already been scorched. At least 16 buildings are gone. Fire authorities say this fire is far from contained. Winds will return. The landscape will dry further. The season is still young. That part worries people the most.“We are early in the summer,” said Chris Hardman, chief fire officer at Forest Fire Management Victoria. And the environment is only heating up. Meteorologists say the numbers are startling. David Crock from Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology described the temperatures as “very unusual.” Around 20 weather stations across western Victoria recorded either all-time highs or January records in a single day.Some towns in the Mallee region reached 48.9 degrees Celsius. The hottest temperature ever recorded in Victoria. Elsewhere, the heat spread north. Parts of western New South Wales and south-west Queensland also saw temperatures soar above 48°C by late afternoon. It feels relentless. Like the heat has nowhere else to go.","Australia's heatwave pushes Victoria into days of extreme heat.
