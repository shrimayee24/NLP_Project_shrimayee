Watch: Rohit Sharma reveals why he ate a speck of soil from Barbados pitch after India's T20 World Cup victory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/watch-rohit-sharma-reveals-why-he-ate-a-speck-of-soil-from-barbados-pitch-after-indias-t20-world-cup-victory/articleshow/111420597.cms,"Right after Hardik Pandya delivered the last ball of the match to signal India's victory in the T20 World Cup final against South Africa in Barbados on June 29, Rohit Sharma 's emotions showed up during different moments, as emotional celebratory scenes unfolded at the Kensington Oval . In one such moment, the India captain walked up to the pitch, got down on his haunches, picked up a speck of soil from the track and ate it.The moment reminded of tennis legend Novak Djokovic eating a strand of grass from the Wimbledon centre court after one of his triumphs at the famous Grand Slam event. But Rohit insisted his move wasn't ""scripted"", rather it was ""instinctive"".Speaking on a video the BCCI recorded during Rohit's photoshoot with the trophy, the India captain shared the emotions that took him to the centre of the ground.""Nothing was scripted; it was all coming instinctively. I was feeling the moment,"" said Rohit in the video shared by BCCI on social media.""...because that pitch gave us this (T20 World Cup), we played on that particular pitch and we won the game on that particular ground, I will remember that ground and that pitch forever in my life. So I wanted to have a piece of it with me. Those moments are very, very special; and the place where all our dreams came true, I wanted something of it. That was the feeling behind it,"" he said.India won the final by seven runs in a last-ball finish, coming back from a point where South Africa seemed to have the game in hand, requiring 30 of 30 balls while chasing India's 176 for 7. But Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah struck crucial blows, helped by Suryakumar Yadav's stupendous catch, in the dying stages to turn the tide and limit the Proteas to 169 for 8.""The feeling actually is surreal,"" Rohit further said. ""I would say it still hasn't sunk in totally. It's been a great moment, right from when the game got over till now. It feels like a dream...Although it has happened, it feels like it hasn't happened. That's the emotion, that's the feeling you have.""We had dreamt about it, worked hard as a unit for such a long period of time. To see this now with us, we feel quite relieved as well because when you work hard for something and you eventually get it in the end, it feels really really nice.""The skipper went on to add that the party went deep into the night, and that he will catch up on sleep once he gets home. However, a hurricane around Barbados has delayed the team's departure. The T20 champions are now expected to arrive back home on Tuesday or Wednesday.""Last night, we were having a good time, had a blast with the teammates till very early morning. So I would say I didn't sleep properly, but that's absolutely fine for me. Not to sleep after a day like that, I am totally fine (with it). There is a lot of time for me to go back home and sleep. So I am going to catch up on that,"" said 37-year-old Rohit, who became the oldest captain to win the T20 World Cup.At the post-match press conference, Rohit went on to announce his retirement from T20Is, a decision that Virat Kohli had also taken soon after the end of the final.""Like I said, this moment was very, very special for all of us, and I want to live it, each moment, each minute, each second that is passing by, I want to make the most of it,"" concluded Rohit, with the T20 World Cup trophy on his side.","Rohit Sharma ate a speck of soil from the track after India's T20 World Cup win. The 37-year-old said it was ""instinctive"" and he was feeling the moment. India won the final by seven runs in a last-ball finish in Barbados.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111420484,imgsize-31492,width-400,resizemode-4/111420484.jpg"
"'Legend' Virat Kohli should not be compared to any cricketer, let alone Babar Azam: Ahmad Shahzad",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/legend-virat-kohli-should-not-be-compared-to-any-cricketer-let-alone-babar-azam-ahmad-shahzad/articleshow/111421172.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Indian cricket team was lauded all over the world by winning the T20 World Cup title.In a thrilling final, Rohit Sharma and his men edged out South Africa by 7 runs at Barbados on Saturday.Virat Kohli proved his big-match credentials, with his 59-ball 76 in the final clash -- after he managed just 75 runs in seven innings during the competition until the finale and was named the man of the match.Lauding the Indian cricket star, former Pakistan cricketer Ahmad Shahzad said that India would have never won the T20 World Cup final without Virat Kohli's innings, adding that no one should compare Babar Azam or any other cricketer to the former Indian captain.In a viral video, Shahzad says, ""Virat Kohli is a legend of our generation and he is leaving behind a legacy in T20I cricket. He has always played his cricket with enthusiasm. Even in his last match, someone else was taking wickets and he was celebrating at long-on, long-off.""Shahzad adds, ""He didn't score runs in the whole World Cup but as destiny would have it, he scored runs in the final when one else scored and had Virat not scored in that final, India wouldn't have won. I think he's leaving a big legacy behind for the Indian team, for the rest of the world. It won't be easy for India to fill in the shoes of Virat Kohli in any format. Good luck to Indian cricket team to fit his shoes.""When asked about the comparisons between Virat and Babar Azam and sometimes even himself, Shahzad said, ""There is no one like Virat Kohli, let alone me, let alone anybody else. People even compare him with Babar Azam. He should not be compared to anyone. He has an amazing strike rate and average in ICC tournaments. So he shouldn't be compared to anyone. He's one and only Virat Kohli, he got the send-off that he deserved. I am happy as a cricketer that Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma got the send-offs that they both deserved.""Kohli bowed out in the shortest international format with 4,188 runs in 125 matches including one century and 38 half tons since his debut in 2010.Virat amassed 1,292 runs at an average of 58.72 and a strike rate of 128.81 in 35 T20 World Cup games, including 15 half-centuries.

Six Indians in ICC T20 World Cup 'Team of the Tournament'; Virat Kohli misses out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/six-indians-in-icc-t20-world-cup-team-of-the-tournament-virat-kohli-misses-out/articleshow/111393688.cms,"ICC Team of The Tournament

12th man:

NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has announced its ' Team of the Tournament ' for the recently concluded T20 World Cup. Despite playing a key role in India's victory over South Africa in the final, star batter Virat Kohli did not find a place in this select squad.India clinched their second T20 World Cup title, defeating South Africa by seven runs in a thrilling climax.Kohli, who was promoted to opener for the tournament, had a relatively quiet World Cup until the grand finale, where he produced a match-winning knock of 76 runs off 59 balls and was named the player of the match. Despite his heroics, Kohli was omitted from the ICC XI.The ICC’s lineup featured six Indian players, reflecting their strong overall performance. Indian skipper Rohit Sharma , Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah , and Arshdeep Singh were all included. Rohit led from the front, amassing 257 runs at an impressive strike rate of 156.7, making him the second-highest run-scorer behind Afghanistan's Rahmanullah Gurbaz.One of the standout performers, Jasprit Bumrah, was named Player of the Tournament. Bumrah took 15 wickets and more importantly, his ability to restrict the scoring rate made him India's trump card. His economy rate of 4.17 was the best recorded by a bowler in a single edition of the men's T20 World Cup.Following a historic semi-final finish, PTI has reported that Afghanistan had three players making it to the ICC team. Left-arm quick Fazalhaq Farooqi topped the wicket-taking charts alongside India’s Arshdeep Singh with 17 wickets each. Wicketkeeper-batter Rahmanullah Gurbaz, who led the run charts with 281 runs, and captain Rashid Khan were the other inclusions from Afghanistan.Skipper Rashid Khan led Afghanistan brilliantly, claiming 14 wickets at an economy of 6.17, showcasing his prowess as both a leader and a player.Australian all-rounder Marcus Stoinis and West Indies’ Nicholas Pooran rounded out the XI, bringing additional balance to the team.South Africa, despite being the runners-up, did not have a player in the XI. However, pacer Anrich Nortje was named the 12th man.Overall, the ICC's 'Team of the Tournament' reflects a mix of individual brilliance and consistent performance across the event, highlighting the standout players who made a significant impact.Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh (all Indians); Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Rashid Khan, Fazalhaq Farooqi (Afghanistan); Marcus Stoinis (Australia) and Nicholas Pooran (West Indies);Anrich Nortje.","The International Cricket Council (ICC) has announced its'Team of the Tournament'for the recently concluded T20 World Cup.

The first WWE Raw night of July 2024 couldn’t have begun in a better fashion, as it had drama, action, and entertainment. While the pre-announced match card was followed pretty strictly, there was no shortage of surprise twists (although most of the results went along expected lines).Four exciting matches were already confirmed before the show aired internationally.There was a healthy mix of grudge battles, qualifiers for the MITB, and a championship was also up for grabs.The night began with an unannounced match featuring Karrion Cross and Xavier Woods. As expected, Cross dominated the match, showing his strength and agility in the ring. However, Woods managed to pull off an extremely unexpected win, thanks to his unsuspecting pinfall. However, the win came at a heavy cost as both Woods and his tag team partner Kingston were beaten to a pulp by The Final Testament.The opening was one of the show's poorer openings in recent times. It’s still unclear what The Final Testament stands for, and making Kross lose to Woods undermines the former’s ability as an upcoming star.Match result: Xavier Woods defeated Karrion CrossMatch grade: DThis match could well have been the highlight contest of this week’s Raw. With a championship at stake, both Zelina and Liv gave it their all. The presence of Dom and Rey on the ringside made matters even more enjoyable. After a strong start, Liv lost a lot of momentum, and Zelina made the most of it.While Liv did get a chance to make a comeback, her attention got diverted towards a feud between Rey and Dom. The latter had pushed his son down to the floor, only to be hit by a Baseball Slide by Liv. Zelina used this chance to land a 619, but Liv escaped once again. At this point, Dom pushed a steel chair toward Zelina, but she refused to use it on Liv.Instead, Zelina used the chair on Dom, which infuriated Liv. She went on to land an ObLIVion to win the match and retain her title. While the result did go along the expected lines, Zelina’s feud with Liv intensified even more and raised her profile as a proper contender.Match result: Liv Morgan defeated Zelina VegaMatch grade: AThe triple-threat match between the three divas was okay at best. Zoey was the dominant figure from minute one, showing her abilities and athleticism. While Dakota did put up a show, she and Ivy were no match for the former partner of Trish Stratus.Of course, external factors interfered, but Zoey would have won the match either way. It will be interesting to see if the creative department gives her a strong push as part of Money in the Bank.Match result: Zoey Stark defeated Dakota Kai and Ivy NileMatch grade: CWhat started as a family feud between Dominik and his father soon turned into an unofficial Mixed Tag Teams match. As Rey was gaining the upper hand, Liv appeared on the ringside. This caused Rey to lose his concentration and shape, and Dom was quick to take advantage.It appeared that Rey was done for as Dom started to land one move after another. But Rey countered and set up a successful 619 attempt, only to have Liv save Dom. There was even a hilarious moment as Dom fell on Liv, leading to whistles and cheers from the audience Then appeared Vega, and it seemed that the two divas were continuing their title fight from the evening.Dom managed to land a 619 and went on top of the turnbuckle. While Liv tried to ensure that Dom lands his move successfully, her interference caused more harm. Rey seized the opportunity to win while Liv was busy telling Dominik that she could “fix this.”Match result: Rey Mysterio defeated Dominik MysterioMatch grade: AExpectations were high from this fight, and they were met. The trio of Drew , Sheamus, and Ilja put up a show, and it seemed that anyone could win. Whenever someone gained an edge, another fought back.The pivotal moment came when Ilja was taken out, as Drew now turned his attention towards Sheamus. Drew managed to withstand a Jumping Knee, only to hit Sheamus back with a Claymore and win the contest. Once again, the result was expected, given what happened in Scotland and what could happen in Toronto this Saturday.Match result: Drew McIntyre defeated Sheamus and Ilja DragunovMatch grade: A","The first WWE Raw night of July 2024 couldn’t have begun in a better fashion, as it had drama, action, and entertainment.

WWE Money in the Bank 2024: Predictions for Seth Rollins vs Damian Priest World Title Match,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/wwe-money-in-the-bank-2024-predictions-for-seth-rollins-vs-damian-priest-world-title-match/articleshow/111412006.cms,"WWE Money in the Bank 2024 could witness Seth Rollins' new rise at the cost of Damian Priest

The contest between Seth Rollins and Damian Priest , scheduled at the WWE Money in the Bank 2024 , could well become the discussion point for the entire community. After all, it's not just an ordinary title match, as there's more at stake. Rollins and Priest have a ""gentleman's agreement"" between them, and it could undoubtedly have a significant effect on the outcome of the clash.When required, Damian Priest managed to stand tall and apart from the remaining members of Judgment Day.He might be carrying the World Heavyweight Championship on his shoulders, but Seth Rollins is a different personality altogether. With due respect to Priest, Rollins is on another level when it comes to resonating with the audience.Most fans believe that bigger things await Rollins, and that could all begin with the upcoming contest during the WWE Money in the Bank 2024. Priest will face The Visionary in what will be a fight for the World Heavyweight championship.However, there's more at stake, all thanks to the gentleman's agreement the two superstars have between them. If Rollins loses the fight, he won't even challenge for the Heavyweight Title as long as Priest has his hands on it. However, Priest will have to leave the Judgment Day if he loses the fight.There's a general feeling that Priest might have outgrown Judgment Day. WWE Money in the Bank 2024 is the perfect chance to ensure that Priest goes the separate way from his current crib, which means that Rollins will win the contest in the future (a speculation, of course). However, Rollins winning the match might not automatically mean that he would get back his cherished title belt.There's a high chance that Judgment Day might intervene during the match (something that has become a common occurrence in recent weeks). Of course, their supposed attempt to help Priest might become the biggest reason for the superstar's departure. This is, of course, if Priest sticks to his agreement with Rollins.This sets up for an exciting outcome - Rollins wins the match, so he gets to challenge Priest in the future (who keeps the title as the WWE Money in the Bank 2024 contest ends in DQ). But Priest will no longer have the backing of Judgment Day, and then enters the third party - Gunther.Gunther's character transformation has been amazing, to say the least - a rise, a fall, and then a rise again. The Ring General was quick to send out the reminder that maybe the better person between Rollins and Priest would win to face him at Summerslam .If the WWE Money in the Bank 2024 contest between Rollins and Priest goes as predicted here, this could set up an eye-grabbing title fight at Summerslam. Instead of Gunther fighting any one of Rollins and Priest, he gets to fight both. That way, the audience gets a triple threat fight for the World Heavyweight Championship, where all three wrestlers have some agendas to fill.Of course, only WWE knows what they want to do with the WWE Money in the Bank 2024 fight, and the outcomes mentioned here are predictions. But fans will hope that the upcoming contest will be spicy, which will be wholly justified given the wrestlers and the stakes involved.","WWE Money in the Bank 2024 could witness Seth Rollins' new rise at the cost of Damian Priest. Priest will face The Visionary in what will be a fight for the World Heavyweight championship.

The video has gone viral on social media.India rode on Virat Kohli's best knock of the tournament, a 59-ball 76, and Axar Patel's 47 to put up a challenging total, before Hardik Pandya (3 for 20), Jasprit Bumrah (2 for 18) and Arshdeep Singh (2 for 20) derailed South Africa's run chase. The Proteas had at one stage moved into a winning position, requiring just a run a ball.The wicket of Heinrich Klaasen (52 of 27 balls) by Pandya and the stunning catch of Suryakumar Yadav to dismiss David Miller (21 off 17 balls) proved to be the turning points in the match.Rohit Sharma's age of 37 years and 60 days on the day of the final (June 29) made him the oldest captain to win a T20 World Cup.

Sumit Nagal shows heart and fight at Wimbledon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon/sumit-nagal-shows-heart-and-fight-at-wimbledon/articleshow/111439309.cms,"LONDON: The sun had faded, the sky was grey, and the westerly was gentle. It was just past 8 pm on Church Road.Sumit Nagal was on his courtside seat, shaking his head. He used his towel as an afterthought. The Indian had his higher-ranked opponent Miomir Kecmanovic on the ropes in the ninth game of the third set at 15-40. The 24-year-old’s second serve was met by a stinging Nagal forehand that pulled the world No.52 wide.The Serbian responded with a deep ball which Nagal hesitated in dispatching into an open court and instead came up with a weak response.Nagal, who made his Wimbledon main draw debut on Monday, finally fell 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 4-6 after a 2-hour 39-minute battle.“Had I won that 3-5 game (in the third set), it could’ve been a different story,” said Nagal. “The match momentum was shifting and obviously when he holds (ninth game) that changes again. It put him ahead two-sets-to-one.”The residue effect was obvious early in the fourth set.“The serving was especially poor,” Nagal said of his play, “if you are missing a lot of first serves, you are always behind, more so when you’re playing on grass.”It was a little past 10 pm, about an hour after the conclusion of the match, and the 26-year-old’s expression still mirrored the lost opportunity.“It was an amazing experience to play my first main draw here at Wimbledon,” he said. “This surface is tricky, you need to have a bit of experience, very tough to go out there and be able to perform the way you want to.”Former world No.1 (doubles) Mahesh Bhupathi, who mentors Nagal, and Rohan Bopanna cheered at courtside.Nagal’s head is constantly ticking, often between points he stretches out his right and uses his index finger as if he were giving directions to a pedestrian. For someone who is quick when chasing a tennis ball across the rectangle, Nagal takes his time getting around otherwise. There’s a swag to his step.Nagal, who peppered the court with winners, 47 in all, delighted with his single-handed backhand slice, which troubled Kecmanovic, especially early in the match.“It’s effective on this surface, especially when you’re running to your backhand side,” said Nagal, who played with a single hander for a good part of his junior years, only switching to a two-hander at 14.“I used to slice a lot when in the juniors,” he said. “But I wanted to really improve my backhand and so changed to a double-hander, which I have improved on a lot in the past few years.""","Sumit Nagal loses to Miomir Kecmanovic in four sets at Wimbledon.

Fighters, heroes, champions, Rohit Sharma and his team gave India one of its most joyous cricketing moments on Saturday night.The T20 World Cup triumph was a team effort but overall, seven men stood taller than the rest.He was in woeful batting form in IPL & stripped of MI captaincy. But cometh the hour, cometh the man! As in ODI World Cup, Rohit again put the team before himself.He played with abandon and flow; his strike rate was a staggering 157 and he scored 257 runs, highest in the squad. More importantly, as commentators said, he exudedcraft and calm in captaincy executing dressing room plans to perfection. His ebullience at the top will be as missed as his captaincyHis 24 fours and 15 sixes were the highest in the team.In 1999, South Africa had dropped the World Cup. Thanks to Yadav, India didn’t. His once-in-a-generation catch in the deep was as memorable as Kapil Dev’s backward sprint and grab of Vivian Richards’. ‘SKY’ had the pressure of living up to his rank as world’s no. 1 T20 batter. His knocks against USA and England were vital to the team’s cause. And his destructive intervention served India well against Australia (31 off 16) and Afghanistan (53 off 28)He scored 60% of his runs in fours and sixes.He rewrote his life story at the World Cup. A foot injury had forced Pandya to quit 2023 ODI WC midway. His MI transfer and captaincy became a huge controversy; his IPL form the subject of cruel digs. But the 30-year-old all-rounder underlined why he is irreplaceable. He scored runs at an electrifying pace (strike rate: 151)this WC and mixed his pace to claim 11 wickets while breaking partnerships and providing vital breakthroughsHis 3/20 included the game changing wickets of Klaasen and Miller in the finalHis aggressive batting and sharp left-arm spin provided India’s most serendipitous moments in the championship. He knifed through England’s top and middle order (3/23), helped India regain momentum with the bat (47 off 31, 4 sixes) in the final and against Pakistan. He arrived as a utility player, left as a premium all-rounderHis breathtaking catch of Oz captain Mitchell Marsh swung the game India’s wayThe thrashing in the final aside, the joyful ‘chinaman’ with curly hair delighted India cricket lovers with his subtle guile and craft from Super 8 onwards. Was at his best breaking England’s back in the semisThe delivery that bowled England’s Harry Brook around the legs can be watched on a loopHe played eight games and was unplayable in each of them. Every batter handled him like expensive glass, with utmost care, and yet all were bamboozled by his video game-like craft. Bumrah is the world’s best paceman, and by a mile. Nobody has his deception, movement, variation, a lethal cocktail that earned him 15 wickets at 8.2 runs apiece for an astonishing economy rate of 4.2. He was The Man of this WC. His ER is the best ever in a T20 WC by a bowler to deliver at least 20 oversToo many. But most notably the wickets of Mohammad Rizwan (Pakistan), Phil Salt (England), Reeza Hendricks and Marco Jansen (SA). All bowled.The 25-year-old Chandigarh-born claimed the second pacer’s spot exploiting the sharp movement and bounce of USA’s uneven pitches and proved to be an admirable foil to Bumrah. His 17 wickets, which made him the tournament’s joint-highest wicket-taker with Afghanistan’s Fazalhaq Farooqi, is also the joint-highest of any T20 WC.Dismissals of the dangerous Tim David and Mathew Wade (Australia) in one over.Wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja and Shivam Dube also had their moments. Pant’s 42 off 31 against Pakistan on a treacherous pitch was invaluable.Squad members Sanju Samson, Yuzvendra Chahal and Yashasvi Jaiswal didn’t get a game.got the best out of his wards, finishing his tenure on a high note.Before the final, his scores were: 1, 4, 0, 24, 37, 0, 9. Balance and focus are his forte. But Kohli, who scored runs by the bagful at IPL 2024, seemed to lose both at the WC. It turned out he had reserved his best for the final. His 76 off 59 balls against SA was more than his total in 7 earlier innings: 75. India will miss his class and reassuring presence in the game’s shortest versionKohli has 16 MoMs in T20I, a world record. Eight of them at WC, again highest for anyone.","The T20 World Cup triumph was a team effort but overall, seven men stood taller than the rest.

"'Jonny will hate me saying this, but...': Root on Bairstow-Carey Ashes 2023 stumping controversy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/jonny-will-hate-me-saying-this-but-root-on-bairstow-carey-ashes-2023-stumping-controversy/articleshow/111435743.cms,"NEW DELHI: Joe Root , England's former captain and current batsman, expressed his unexpected perspective on the unique dismissal of Jonny Bairstow during the 2023 Ashes series against Australia. While acknowledging the legality of the dismissal, Root emphasized the importance of players being more vigilant on the field.The incident occurred during the second Test of the Ashes series, with England facing a daunting chase of 371 runs.Jonny Bairstow, known for his tenacity, was on 10 runs when the controversial moment took place.After evading a delivery, Bairstow inadvertently wandered out of his crease, believing the ball to be dead. However, Alex Carey , the Australian wicketkeeper, capitalized on the situation and swiftly stumped Bairstow before he could return to safety.The dismissal, which occurred on the fourth day, proved to be a turning point in the match. England, requiring 371 runs for victory, was bowled out for 327, resulting in Australia taking a 2-0 lead in the series. The nature of Bairstow's dismissal ignited a controversy that reverberated throughout the cricketing world.As the Australian team returned to the Long Room for lunch, members of the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) expressed their discontent with the incident.The cricketing community engaged in heated discussions about the 'Spirit of Cricket', with some arguing that Bairstow should have been cautioned before the stumping, while others maintained that the dismissal, although contentious, adhered to the laws of the game.In the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) Board's documentary, 'The Ashes 2023 Our Take', Joe Root openly discusses the event. ""Initially I was quite angry, but I think when you are involved in the game it is very difficult to put yourself in the other position. So I would like to say I would have dealt with it differently (than Australia), but I could very easily have done the same thing,"" IANS quoted Root as saying.Root's perspective is one of understanding and realism. ""Jonny will hate me saying this, but if you stay in your crease you can't get given out can you? At the end of the day it is within the laws of the game. You should be aware as a player,"" he added.Root praised the exceptional leadership of captain Ben Stokes , who guided the team through challenging circumstances. Despite the controversial dismissal at Lord's, Stokes' determination and tactical prowess helped England achieve a 2-2 series draw. The team secured decisive victories in the third and fifth Tests, while rain prevented a potential England win in the fourth Test at Manchester.Root also discussed the broader impact of the Lord's incident on the team's morale. ""It deserved more than for us to come out on the wrong end of that (Lord's) result. For England's captain to show us this is how we play our cricket regardless of the situation, regardless of what people might have said in the first innings, how we got dismissed, reckless, careless, no thought behind it. It was a really powerful moment for us as a team and the rest of the series as well,"" he concluded.Although Australia retained the coveted Ashes urn by drawing the series, they were unable to secure a series victory in England, a feat they haven't achieved since 2001.","England batsman Joe Root discusses controversial dismissal of Jonny Bairstow.

Turkey adopted a 5-4-1 system and were content to let Austria control possession, looking to catch their opponents on the break. This strategy disrupted Austria's usual straightforward playing style.Despite missing their suspended captain Hakan Calhanoglou, Turkey's defensive strategy paid off as Austria failed to register any shots on target in the first half. After the break, Austria came out with renewed vigor and had a golden opportunity to equalize early in the second half when captain Marko Arnautovic was one-on-one with Turkey's keeper but saw his shot blocked.Instead, it was Demiral again who found the net, heading home in the 59th minute to double Turkey's lead.Austria pulled a goal back in the 66th minute when substitute Gregoritsch finished at the far post.

The US squad struggled to create significant chances and never seemed capable of seriously challenging the well-organized Uruguayans.""It's difficult to say right now, obviously the emotions are running high,"" a disappointed US captain Christian Pulisic was quoted as saying by AFP after the game. ""We had a good start and brought a lot of energy, but just didn't have enough quality. We just couldn't find a solution.""Hopes for the US dimmed early as news arrived that Panama had taken a 1-0 lead against Bolivia in Orlando within the first 30 minutes. The Americans' prospects brightened briefly in the second half when Bolivia equalized, making the score 1-1 and giving the US a potential path to qualification if they could hold Uruguay.However, those hopes were short-lived. Uruguay took the lead through Mathias Olivera in controversial circumstances in the 66th minute. Ronald Araujo’s powerful header from a Nicolas de la Cruz free-kick was parried by US goalkeeper Matt Turner, only for Olivera to score on the rebound. Replays suggested Olivera was offside when Araujo initially made contact, but after a lengthy VAR review, Peruvian referee Kevin Ortega allowed the goal to stand.The US's chances of advancing grew increasingly slim when Panama regained their lead with a goal from Eduardo Guerrero to make it 2-1. The final blow came in stoppage time when Cesar Yanis scored a third for Panama, sealing their victory and ensuring the US's elimination.The early exit for the USA raises questions about the future of coach Gregg Berhalter, who has faced considerable criticism from American fans.
