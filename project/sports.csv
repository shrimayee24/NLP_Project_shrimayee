NEW DELHI: West Indies are set to face England in their first Super Eight match of the T20 World Cup, aiming to maintain their winning streak. Both teams are seeking their third T20 World Cup title. West Indies remain unbeaten in the tournament, while England had a tense group stage and needed Australia's assistance to stay in contention.Coming off a defeat against Australia in the league stage, England now has the chance to focus and start fresh. West Indies are riding high on an eight-match winning streak, with their most recent victory being a 104-run win against Afghanistan at the Darren Sammy National Cricket Stadium .The match will once again take place at the stadium named after West Indies' head coach and two-time T20 World Cup-winning captain, Darren Sammy. The West Indies team has been functioning cohesively, with their batters and bowlers stepping up whenever needed.West Indies showcased an impressive performance against Afghanistan, and they aim to replicate that outcome. As they operate as a united team, key players like Shane Rutherford and Nicholas Pooran are taking responsibility when required. This collective effort is crucial as they go into the match with a solid strategy.The flat pitches and relatively short square boundaries at the venue favor batters, as all matches there have been high-scoring encounters. However, cross winds can affect play, sending some balls flying for six while making others swirl unpredictably. Nicholas Pooran exploited these conditions against Afghanistan.West Indies will rely on their left-arm spin duo of Akeal Hosein and Gudakesh Moti against England's primarily right-handed batting lineup. Although the pitch favours batters, the extra bounce is advantageous for the fast bowlers, making left-arm medium pacer Obed McCoy's role crucial. England pacers Jofra Archer and Mark Wood will also aim to capitalize on these conditions.The two teams have faced each other frequently in the past and are well-versed in each other's strengths and weaknesses. The familiarity between the teams adds an extra layer of intrigue to the matchup.England is set to take on the host nation, West Indies, in the second fixture of the Super 8s stage at the ICC Men's T20 World Cup. The encounter will be held at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in Saint Lucia on Wednesday, June 19. Indian fans can catch the live action at 6am IST on Thursday, 20th June.In head-to-head matches, West Indies have won 17 out of 29 encounters against England, while England have won 12.Nicholas Pooran from the West Indies has played 4 matches and batted in 4 innings, scoring 164 runs with a highest score of 98. His batting average was 41.00, and he faced 109 balls with a strike rate of 150.45. Pooran scored 1 half-century, hit 10 fours, and 13 sixes, without recording any ducks.Akeal Hosein of the West Indies has played 4 matches, bowled in 4 innings, and delivered 90 overs, averaging 15 overs per innings, with 1 maiden. He conceded 62 runs and took 9 wickets, with his best bowling figures being 5 wickets for 11 runs. His bowling average was 6.88, with an economy rate of 4.13 and a strike rate of 10.00. He achieved one five-wicket haul but no four-wicket hauls.Jofra Archer of England has played 4 matches and bowled in 4 innings.

John Cena vs. Damien Sandow - World Heavyweight Championship Match: Raw, Oct. 28, 2013

Money in the Bank is a briefcase that can either work in a wrestler's favor or completely against them. Some wrestlers have changed their fortunes and won championship titles after cashing in, while others have failed miserably. These failures demonstrate that the briefcase isn't always advantageous. Some superstars cashed in at the wrong time, while others failed even when everything seemed to be in their favor. Curious about the unlucky ones? Check out the list below.On the July 16 episode of Raw, Cena announced his intention to cash in his contract the following week at Raw 1000, making him only the second wrestler, after Rob Van Dam , to give advance notice to his opponent. However, at Raw 1000, Cena failed to win the WWE title when Big Show interfered, causing champion CM Punk to be disqualified and retain the title. Cena is noted as one of the prominent MITB holders who was unsuccessful in cashing in.After John Cena, Braun Strowman became the next Superstar to cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase with a formal announcement. He declared his intention to challenge Roman Reigns for the WWE Championship inside Hell in a Cell. The match was intense, showcasing both wrestlers dominating each other and delivering a spectacular performance similar to two titans battling for supremacy.However, the match took a dramatic turn when Brock Lesnar unexpectedly returned, forcefully entering the cell by breaking down its door. Lesnar proceeded to assault both competitors with such intensity that the referee had no choice but to declare the match a no-contest. This outcome meant Strowman joined the ranks of superstars who, despite winning the Money in the Bank ladder match, failed to secure a championship victory.Baron Corbin cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase during the one-on-one match between John Cena and Jinder Mahal on SmackDown. At the time, Mahal was taking a beating from Cena. However, during the match, Corbin appeared and cashed in his Money in the Bank contract for a shot at the WWE title against Jinder Mahal.Just as Mahal got to his feet, the referee signaled for the match to start, and Corbin immediately attacked Cena, who was on the apron. In that critical moment, Mahal seized the opportunity, executing a surprise leverage pin from behind Corbin, and managed to retain the WWE title successfully.Austin Theory is the first wrestler to cash in the briefcase for a United States Championship match. He used the contract to challenge Seth ""Freakin"" Rollins for the WWE United States Championship on the November 7, 2022, episode of Raw. However, Theory failed to win the title due to an attack by Bobby Lashley, which allowed Rollins to pin Theory and retain the championship.As one of the self-proclaimed smartest Superstars of all time, Sandow employed a cunning strategy when he cashed in his Money in the Bank contract. He ambushed Cena during an in-ring interview, targeting Cena's injured shoulder with a cheap shot. Sandow then delivered a brutal beating, literally adding insult to injury.Seeing that Cena's shoulder was significantly damaged, Sandow seized the opportunity and cashed in his contract on the spot. Despite an intense back-and-forth match, Cena fought through the pain, ultimately managing to hit an Attitude Adjustment on Sandow with just one good arm, retaining his WWE Championship.",John Cena is one of the prominent MITB holders who was unsuccessful in cashing in.

WV Raman

interviewed too

NEW SELECTOR TO BE APPOINTED SOON

MUMBAI: Former India opener Gautam Gambhir , who played a significant role in India’s two World Cup victories in 2007 and 2011, is set to replace Rahul Dravid as the new head coach of the Indian men’s cricket team . On Tuesday, Gambhir and former India opener and ex-India women’s team coach WV Raman were interviewed via Zoom for the job by the BCCI ’s Cricket Advisory Committee The BCCI is likely to make a formal announcement regarding Gambhir’s appointment towards the closing stages of the ongoing T20 World Cup , or just after its conclusion. The 42-year-old would be the head coach for all the three formats of the game, and his term, which will start from July 2024, will end in December 2027, after the conclusion of the 50-over World Cup that year.Gambhir was interviewed at 12 pm, while Raman’s interview began at 12.45pm and lasted for 30 minutes. It's not clear if any other candidates will be interviewed on Wednesday.The BCCI had invited applications for the job on its website after Dravid, who took up the role after the 2021 T20 World Cup, expressed his inability to continue as the India head coach after the end of his term, which was extended by six months after the 2023 ODI World Cup in India last year.The deadline to apply for the post was May 27, a day after the IPL final. Gambhir is currently a mentor of the 2024 IPL champions Kolkata Knight Riders -- a post he will obviously quit following his India appointment. Like it has done in the past, the BCCI will give Gambhir the freedom to choose the team's support staff.Dravid, TOI has learnt, is already on the radar of a couple of IPL teams and could be joining them as the team director. The CAC comprises former India cricketers Ashok Malhotra, Jatin Paranjape and Sulakshana Naik.""Gambhir was in Delhi and appeared for the interview on Zoom. CAC head Ashok Malhotra is doing commentary in Punjab T20 League and attended via zoom, but Paranjape and Naik were at the BCCI HQ in Mumbai. The interview was a mere formal part of the process, since the BCCI bosses are convinced that he's the right man for the job, as they sense the need to have a coach who can take a few tough calls going forward in Indian cricket ,"" a source told TOI.Speculation had been rife that Gambhir could take up an important position in Indian cricket ever since he quit ‘active politics' on March 2, just ahead of BJP's candidate list announcement for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. The fact that KKR clinched the IPL this year, after they finished seventh in 2023, convinced the decision makers in Indian cricket that Gambhir was apt for the job, even though he hasn't coached any team in international or domestic cricket. Previously, the 42-year-old was a mentor of Lucknow Super Giants, who made the playoffs in both the years that he was in charge.Gambhir had also captained KKR to IPL titles in 2012 and 2014 (incidentally Raman was the team's batting coach that year) and led the team for seven seasons.It helped his case that the BCCI was keen on an Indian coach to take up the crucial role, with Board secretary Jay Shah having said recently that the cricket body hadn't approached any former Australian cricketer for the job. ""It will be great for Indian cricket,"" a franchise owner told TOI on Gambhir taking over as India coach soon. Gambhir's post IPL final long chat with BCCI secretary Jay Shah in Chennai on May 26 further increased the chatter around his taking up the India head coach job soon.Meanwhile, the CAC is also supposed to conduct interviews to find a selector from the North Zone, who will replace Salil Ankola in the selection committee. Both Ankola and chief selector Ajit Agarkar are from the West Zone. Agarkar was appointed in July last year and replaced Chetan Sharma, who had to quit after a sting operation. Ankola was already a selector when Agarkar took over.",Gautam Gambhir and WV Raman interviewed by BCCI's Cricket Advisory Committee.

NEW DELHI: When the United States cricket team entered the ICC T20 World Cup 2024, few anticipated their historic journey to the Super 8s. However, they executed their plans brilliantly, securing a place in the Super 8s where they are set to face South Africa at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua on Wednesday.Ahead of this exciting clash, the White House has sent a special message to the US cricket team ahead of their encounter with the Proteas in the Super 8s.""Thank you White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby for your kind words. We’ll be sure to use your encouragement as motivation for our upcoming matches in the West Indies!,"" USA Cricket's social media handle wrote while posting a video.""Congratulations to them. They are in Super 8 now. It's amazing. We all congratulate them on their success. It's tremendous and we cheer them on,"" White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby said in the video.The USA, making their debut in the ICC T20 World Cup tournament, began their campaign impressively by defeating Canada by 7 wickets at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.Their next challenge came against the 2009 champions Pakistan, where the co-hosts faced a formidable task. Despite being underdogs, the USA came out firing on all cylinders to shock Babar Azam's team at a packed Grand Prairie Stadium.The USA bowlers restricted Pakistan to 159 for 7, then levelled that score to force a Super Over.

We knew they will take chances after their partnership. We knew we were in the game with 160 to chase, just needed a partnership. Playing in a World Cup, you don’t get a chance to do it every year.

T20 cricket

BARBADOS: The Eden Gardens in Kolkata has seen many great Test matches over the years. But one game that the old-timers never forget to mention in conversations over afternoon tea is the 1958-59 Test against West Indies , where Rohan Kanhai got a double hundred, Garry Sobers a century, and then Wes Hall and Roy Gilchrist ripped India apart.Among many legends about that game, one that stands out is about Hall and his run-up which the oldies describe as the longest they had seen in more than half a century. ""He used to run in from the High Court,"" some would say in jest, referring to the far end of the ground and Hall's never-ending run-up.Hall is 86 now, but when he is reminded of India, the old man gets emotional. ""I enjoyed playing in India, there is so much to the country. I was still a young boy when I had gone to India,"" Hall went back in time as he met the current Indian players and journalists on Tuesday afternoon.It didn't take him too long to go into the run-up story and Hall remembered how he couldn't run properly when he first went to England.""I took a year off and worked on my legs. I used to run on the beach here in Barbados, 10-12 miles at the same rate. Unless you have your balance going, you can't bowl well, it's like a horse in a race. If you don't train it to know when to pull away it can't do it on the day, so that's how I trained. Slow and steady and then sprint, slow and steady and then sprint... On that India tour, it really helped me, I got a lot of wickets,"" Hall, who played 48 Tests in a span of 16 years taking 192 wickets, said.A lot has changed since the time the legend played his cricket . The game has gone through a metamorphosis and today's version of T20 is far removed from the sport in whites that created the myth around West Indies. But Hall accepts it. ""It's fine, if WG Grace saw us play, he would also have been wondering; it's the same with us when we see today's cricket. My only grouse is when batsmen are allowed to bat 20 overs, why should bowlers be stipulated to only four,"" Hall asks.But the great man, who took nine wickets in the first tied Test match between West Indies and Australia at the Gabba in 1960, feels the art of pace bowling will never die despite the difficulties that it has to face in this day and age of T20 cricket.""If the rules don't change, people may not be very keen to bowl fast. But god forbid, for cricket to be beautiful, the art of bowling fast has to continue forever and ever,"" Hall says.Talking of the ideal fast bowler and one who could invoke fear in the minds of the opposition, Halls talks about his fellow Barbadian Joel Garner ""and that boy from Antigua"" Curtly Ambrose .""I like a paceman who is six feet tall --like our Big Bird Joel Garner and Ambrose. These fellows could get that bounce and batsmen could not get runs because they had to evade. If West Indies can again have 8 -10 fast bowlers it will be great…You know when I was playing there used to be 25 and it was so difficult to get into the team,"" Hall recollected, looking to be in the mood to carry on.But the sun was getting hotter by the minute and with Virat Kohli waiting to have a word with him, the conversation had to be cut short. And as Hall slowly walked away after meeting Kohli, down the Garry Sobers pavilion, you couldn't help that feeling: ""If only I had seen him bowl"".","Wes Hall played 48 Tests in a span of 16 years taking 192 wickets.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Wasim Akram commended India's wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant 's remarkable comeback following a severe accident, describing it as an inspiring tale for future generations. He referred to Pant as a 'miracle child,' acknowledging his extraordinary performance on comeback in the Indian Premier League and the T20 World Cup .Akram expressed relief upon seeing Pant's recovery and lauded his batting prowess. The former pace legend conveyed these sentiments in an interview with Sportskeeda, emphasizing the collective concern felt even in Pakistan over Pant's condition after the accident.""Pant ki performance dekh rahe hai. Miracle jo iss ladke ne kiya hai, dikhaya hai ki he is super human. Jis tragedy se woh wapas aaya hai. Jis tarah se uska accident, maine clips dekhe the, we were all worried in Pakistan [The kind of performance Pant is giving after that accident, he is proving he is a super human. We saw the clips and all were worried about him]. I was worried, actually maine tweet bhi kiya tha unke baare me. And he came back and he averaged 40 this year in IPL - 446 runs, strike rate of 155. Woh toh miracle bachcha hai,” Akram said.In the ongoing T20 World Cup, Pant maintains his exceptional form, leading as the top run-scorer for Team India after the group stages, having scored 96 runs in three innings with an average of 48.Akram also praised Pant's Test career achievements, pointing to significant innings against Australia and England.""Jis tarike se usne Test cricket me performance di. Jo Australia me jaake usne 100 kiya. Phir uske baad England ke khilaaf usne batting ki. Test cricket me reverse sweeps, [James] Anderson ko, [Pat] Cummins ko. He is special,"" Akram said.Reflecting on Pant’s resilience and mental strength post-accident, Akram deemed his story a powerful example for young people globally.""And especially what he has been through in that horrific accident. Uske baad comeback karna. Kitna mentally strong yeh ladka hoga. That's a story to be told for generations to generations in my opinion. To motivate young people of the world - ki comeback ho sakta hai, jaise Pant ne kiya,” he added.Akram echoed former India captain Sourav Ganguly 's perception of Pant as a natural and instinctive leader.""I will second Ganguly that Pant ek natural captain hai, instinctive captain he jo mauke par decision karta hai. Woh bada jaruri hai T20 format mai [Agree with Ganguly that Pant is a natural, instinctive captain and took decisions according to the situation, which is very important in T20 cricket],"" Akram said.""Aap T20 format me yeh nahi jaa sakte ki yaar ek raat pahle - do overs yeh karega, do overs yeh karega, do overs yeh karega, na.

The business end of the T20 World Cup begins for India against spirited Afghanistan . Rohit Sharma 's men have never lost to the Afghans in this format and are a much stronger team on paper, but this is a high-stakes World Cup game in sticky Caribbean conditions.Remember, the last T20I played between the two teams in Bengaluru on Jan 17, 2024 was the only one in T20I history to feature two sets of Super Overs. The Afghans will be no pushovers.Matches in the US were low-scoring affairs with the ball dominating bat, but things are expected to improve in the Caribbean. The Barbados track has been a sporting pitch with an average bat-first score of 172.Both teams may look to bat first if they win the toss. It's worth mentioning that the Afghans excel at defending targets but tend to struggle while chasing.The previous game here saw Australia score 201 batting first against England. For Afghanistan, inform openers Gurbaz andIbrahim Zadran will once again be the key.Caribbean tracks are usually spin-friendly, with finger-spinners who bowl faster and flatter - like Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel - expected to do well.However, leg-spinners have done well here too, and India's dilemma is what to do with in-form left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav, who has been warming the bench.The wily leggie is an expert at turning matches with key wickets in the middle while keeping the scoring rate down. Can India's batter of the moment Rishabh Pant , designated spin-hitter Shivam Dube and the maverick Suryakumar Yadav keep him quiet?Left-arm pace has been the Indian captain's old bugbear and Afghanistan will depend heavily on Farooqi to get India's opener with the one that swings in.Another potentially spicy faceoff given the history of antagonism between the two. Kohli's recent rough patch may put extra pressure on him to take on the pacers.How this one goes may well decide which way the contest swings.","The business end of the T20 World Cup begins for India against spirited Afghanistan.

BARBADOS: The Indian team is in a happy space. The players look relaxed, enjoying every bit of the trip, pulling each other's legs, breaking out into laughter once in a while, yet extremely intense when they get into the nets to bat or bowl.It has a lot to do with captain Rohit Sharma and his ways - frank, friendly, chatting with the media and telling his boys, ""Go talk to the media yaar,, how long will the captain speak for you?""It's this infectious energy and happy vibes of Rohit that have put an already good team completely at ease as they get ready to play Afghanistan on Thursday.India landed here a couple of days earlier and trained at the Kensington Oval nets. They struggled with the bat on a few occasions after a spot of rain made the pitch stickier, but were always quietly confident that ""if New York conditions could be negotiated, everything else can be"".After Afghanistan on Thursday, India play Bangladesh on Saturday. If current form and pedigree are any indication, India should wrap up their semifinal entry even before they play Australia in St. Lucia on Tuesday.The team knows it too but that doesn't make them complacent. Despite the complete domination India have enjoyed over Afghanistan over the last few years in every format, they are not taking Rashid Khan 's boys lightly at all. Rashid himself is an IPL legend while the likes of chinaman Noor Ahmed, opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz or medium-pacer Naveenul-Haq are moderately familiar faces on the Indian circuit.But more than the quality of the players, it's the warrior-spirit of the Afghans that Team India needs to be careful about. T20, at the end of the day, is a flippant format and a small phase of 12 balls here and there can turn the game upside down.Add to that the decent run that Afghanistan enjoyed in the group stages, till they were handed a reality check by an impressive West Indies in St. Lucia. But India will keep in mind that Afghanistan have beaten a team of great pedigree in New Zealand. Interestingly, the conditions here at Kensington Oval might just be to the liking of both teams.Discussions with locals suggest that 180 could be a par score, while spinners should get some assistance. The Afghans have their own battery of tweakers led by Rashid, and it will be interesting to see if India manage to find a place for chinaman Kuldeep Yadav ahead of paceman Mohammed Siraj, who has looked the least dangerous till now.But Rohit would also be mindful of the fact that the Afghans aren't the greatest players of pace bowling either. If the ball is aimed at their ribcage at good speed, the likes of Gurbaaz and others do tend to flounder a bit. And the pace-attack that India has is being touted as the best in this World Cup. If Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh find their rhythm straight up, the boys in blue should be setting the pace right from the word go.As for the batting, there's enough depth and experience in the Indian ranks to deal with any kind of Afghan threat. And with Virat Kohli due for a big one and Rohit completely at ease with his own game, there is a case for the 2007 champions to race off the blocks, as West Indies did in St Lucia the other day.If India can set the early pace, Thursday should be a comfortable day in office for the team and a stress-free evening for the fans back home.","India take on Afghanistan in their second T20 World Cup match on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: India's coach, Rahul Dravid , issued a warning, saying his team will ""not take Afghanistan lightly"" in their opening match of the T20 World Cup on Thursday in Barbados .India moved to the Super Eights , which consisted of two groups of four, having gone undefeated in the first round of pool play.Dravid is well aware of the struggle his team faces at the Kensington Oval, since India defeated Afghanistan in a T20 match in Bengaluru in January, requiring two Super Overs to win.""We know Afghanistan is a very dangerous team in this format of the game,"" former India batsman Dravid , 51 told a pre-match press conference on Wednesday, according to AFP. ""They have shown that by their performances in this World Cup.""They might not have a lot of international experience in the other formats of the game, but a lot of their players do play in a lot of T20 leagues, more than in fact some of our players do.""So, certainly in this format they are not a team to be taken lightly. They are deservedly in the Super Eights.""Afghanistan have lived up to the hype that they could be semifinalists.Prior to an overwhelming 104-run loss by a surging West Indies in a match between two unbeaten teams on Monday in St. Lucia, when Nicholas Pooran smashed 98 for the tournament co-hosts, they had already secured their spot in the Super Eights.But earlier in the competition, Afghanistan hammered New Zealand for 84 runs.Afghanistan's success has been largely attributed to Rashid Khan 's excellent spin bowling, who led the way against New Zealand in Guyana by taking four wickets for 17 runs.However, in the same match, left-arm fast bowler Fazalhaq Farooqi also took 4-17, and New Zealand was eliminated for just 75.""They have a good bowling attack all round,"" said Dravid. ""Even their two pacers are quite experienced. Farooqi and Naveen-ul-Haq have both played a lot of cricket, they both swing the ball as well.""I think their bowlers are some of the most sought-after bowlers in this format across the world.""We understand that is going to pose a challenge to us and we are going to have to play well to counter that.""Jonathan Trott , the coach of Afghanistan, said that better player relations had resulted from the introduction of T20 franchise cricket, which was driven by the Indian Premier League and ""obviously very different from when I played"".However, the 43-year-old claimed that the acquired information ""works both ways"".""We had nine, 10 players at the IPL. They will be able to share their knowledge of Indian players, and they'll be able to do the same with our players,"" explained Trott. ""That's the current state of world cricket.""I think it's in a good position, and it's very healthy. And we're in the middle of a World Cup and we're in Barbados, so the world's pretty good.""Trott maintained that Nicholas Pooran's ferocious attack would potentially help his team defeat India.""Pooran played a great knock,"" said the former England batsman. ""But other sides are going to have players of that calibre, who on their day can win matches like Pooran did. So, I think it's a good thing that it's happened.""We've learned lessons and we're going to put that right starting tomorrow (Thursday).""","India coach Rahul Dravid says his team will ""not take Afghanistan lightly"" in their opening match of the T20 World Cup on Thursday in Barbados.

BARBADOS: When somebody referred to Suryakumar Yadav as Mohammed Siraj by mistake, there was a roll of laughter in the press-conference room.

Rather he embraces it and tries to explain why he is ""the game changer"" for India.""To be the best T20 batter in the world, I have to know how to bat in different conditions. I always try to keep changing according to the situation,"" Surya said after a practice session on Tuesday, when he batted for almost 40 minutes at the nets.He was seen bringing out all those horizontal bat shots that have made him the best in business during practice and he wants to keep doing it against the likes of Rashid Khan and Noor Ahmed , who have looked pretty good in the tournament so far. ""My area of strength is when the spinners are bowling and the pitch is slow. I have my gameplan which I have worked on in practice. We obviously have plans about Afghanistan and we will try to bring that to good use,"" the right-hand middle-order batter said.In fact, the 33-year-old is pretty comfortable being called the game changer. ""When I first walked into the Indian dressing room, I had to figure out how I have to play and how people have played in that No. 4 position. That phase between overs 7-14 are crucial because if the attacking intent can be maintained, the work for the latter batters at the death becomes easier. So I always wanted to be the game changer, I have tried a lot of match simulations so that I can be the game changer on a given day,"" Surya said.In New York, Surya scored a 49-ball 50 against USA, which was slow by his standards, but it was good enough to win the game for India. He expects the pitches to be better in the West Indies, but if it is slow, the batter has a gameplan ready.""When the ball is not coming on to the bat, the first thing you should do is to hit the gap and run hard. Yes, it becomes difficult to generate force and you have to be smart and change according to the situation. The best way is to keep talking to your partner, calm the nerves down and go about the business.""It's this simplicity in approach of Surya that makes him such a special player in T20s and it's about keeping it going for a while longer.","Suryakumar Yadav doesn't feel any pressure being referred to as the best T20 batter in the last two years.

It is highly likely that Gambhir will replace Rahul Dravid , who will step down after the team's T20 World Cup campaign in the Americas.Dravid was already on an extension after his initial contract ended following last year's ODI World Cup at home. He chose not to seek another term after the T20 World Cup in the USA and Caribbean.Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batsman Kamran Akmal believes Gambhir is the ideal candidate for the head coach position. He also suggested that Team India consider legendary pacers Ashish Nehra or Zaheer Khan as potential options for the bowling coach role.""Gambhir jo cheez chootha hai, wo sona ban jaati hai. Wo jis team se judta hai, wo successful ho jaati hai [Whatever Gambhir touches turns into gold. The team he joins becomes successful],"" Kamran told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.""Team India doesn't need any foreign coaches. They have plenty of options and talent. After Dravid, no one can be the best and bigger than Gautam Gambhir. He was a big player and will become a great coach too. He is the best option India have right now.""Gambhir was with Lucknow Super Giants (LSG). They did really well under him. He became a mentor of KKR and they became champions. He is an amazing planner and has a brilliant cricketing mind. I have played a lot of cricket with him. We have been together for a long time. We played, had food, and had chats together. We are still good friends. We are still in touch,"" he said.""He is the best man to coach Team India. He should be the head coach. India can go for Ashish Nehra or Zaheer Khan as bowling coach,"" Kamran added.Current India head coach Dravid is currently with the team for the T20 World Cup in the Americas. India topped Group A and are now in Barbados for their Super 8 matches. They will face Afghanistan on June 20 in their first Super 8 match.Praising Dravid, Kamran Akmal remarked that the legendary cricketer has significantly contributed to Indian cricket both as a batsman and a coach.""Rahul Dravid has given a lot to Indian cricket. Not just with his batting, he has given a lot to Indian cricket as a coach as well. He has been working with a different model with Team India. He is one of the greats. Be it Dravid, Tendulkar, Ganguly or Dhoni, these four have given a lot to Indian cricket. And Team India should take help from these four cricketers as much as possible,"" Kamran said.""Dravid started coaching U-19 cricket and then went to NCA and then the senior team. Just look at his graph. He is someone who believes in making the roots and foundation so strong. He has made his Team India.

Kuldeep Yadav: T20 World Cup: How can India bring Kuldeep Yadav into the playing XI?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-how-can-india-bring-kuldeep-yadav-into-the-playing-xi/articleshow/111100009.cms,"Pant takes a break

BRIDGETOWN: It's been one of the most difficult decisions for the team management so far — how to play Kuldeep Yadav , who came into the event in red-hot form but hasn't got a game yet?And now that India are into the West Indies leg of the World Cup, is there a temptation to get the left-arm wrist spinner into the playing XI?On both days of practice at the Kensington Oval here, the chinaman bowler was seen turning his arm over for long spells.In the spinners' net, Kuldeep was definitely the best bowler in action.In the long spell that he bowled in tandem with Ravindra Jadeja , both got the ball to turn quite a bit. It's difficult to predict whether the nature of the practice pitch and the centre-wicket where the game will be played on Thursday will be of similar nature. But if it is anything close, Kuldeep should be in the fray.During his spell, Kuldeep got both Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli out, not a mean feat wherever you're playing. While Rohit lobbed one back to Kuldeep, Virat's slash outside the off-stump should have resulted in a catch in cover.But the problem of including Kuldeep here will mean that the team will have to break a winning combination. India will be extremely reluctant to drop any of the four all-rounders in Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Jadeja and Axar Patel. If there has to be a change, it has to be to leave Mohammed Siraj out.""Ideally, India should go in with three pacers and three spinners, but it's to be seen whether they are ready to take the gamble,"" an insider who has a fair understanding of the Kensington Oval conditions told TOI.The team management, too, understands that it is slightly unfair to keep Kuldeep out. Bowling coach Paras Mhambrey had said that the left-armer could well be in the equation once the group moves to the West Indies.Captain Rohit, too, had spoken of some ""secret"" up his sleeve that he didn't want to divulge in New York. ""You'll have to wait for some more time to know what it is,"" Rohit had said during one of his interactions.One feels in slightly favourable conditions for spinners, Kuldeep can well be that secret weapon that Rohit had spoken about. But there's absolutely no denying that two finger spinners and one wrist-spinner, and all in good form, make the attack look way more balanced.The fact that Aussie leggie Adam Zampa became the Man of the Match here in a high-scoring match when they played England should also be in the team management's mind when they sit down to choose the XI.Rishabh Pant had a long batting and wicket-keeping session on Monday but he took a break on Tuesday. It was an optional session and Pant might well have been cooling his heels before a final training session on Wednesday.",Kuldeep Yadav is in red-hot form but hasn't got a game yet.

NEW DELHI: South Africa 's world-class batters will be eager to showcase their skills against a determined USA side in their first Super Eight match of the T20 World Cup on Wednesday. The Proteas have remained undefeated in the tournament thus far, with their bowlers shouldering the responsibility in all four matches.Despite playing three games on the demanding New York pitches and one in Kingstown, South Africa has yet to surpass the 120-run mark in any of their matches. This batting performance does not reflect the team's potential, which boasts powerful hitters such as Quinton de Kock, Henriech Klassen, Tristan Stubbs, and David Miller. However, the top order consisting of De Kock, Reeze Hendricks, and captain Aiden Markram may feel the need to step up their game.South Africa narrowly escaped defeat against Nepal in their last match, and with formidable opponents like defending champions England and hosts West Indies also in Group 2, the Proteas cannot afford to relax against USA. They will be determined to begin the Super Eight stage with a victory.Prior to the World Cup, South Africa's primary worry was Anrich Nortje 's poor form, but the star pacer has turned things around with some outstanding performances in the group stage, currently tied for second place among leading wicket-takers with nine scalps. Nortje and fellow pacer Ottneil Baartman have formed an impressive duo, while Marco Jansen and Kagiso Rabada will also be looking to unsettle the inexperienced USA batters.Co-host USA, a diverse team consisting of eight Indians, two Pakistanis, a West Indian, one New Zealander, a South African, and a Dutch player, is in the midst of a remarkable run, having qualified for the Super Eights in their debut appearance. They have displayed an aggressive style of play throughout the tournament.The USA team will be monitoring the fitness of their skipper, Monank Patel, who missed the match against India and was also set to sit out against Ireland due to a niggle. They will be eager to cause another upset after defeating former champions Pakistan in the league stage. While it may be a challenging task, the spirited group is prepared to face the challenge head-on.The T20 World Cup Super 8 encounter between the United States (USA) and South Africa (SA) is set to take place on June 19 at 8:00 PM IST, as part of the Super Eights stage of the T20 World Cup 2024. The Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound, Antigua, will host this historic match.This will be the first ever T20I match between the United States and South Africa.The North Sound Stadium pitch has already hosted four matches in the tournament, and it has proven to be a challenging surface for the batsmen. The new ball bowlers have found swing, while the spinners have also managed to extract turn from the wicket once the ball has lost its shine. Scoring runs on this track will be a daunting task for the batters, and it is likely that the bowlers will have a significant impact on the outcome of the game.The Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua has hosted four matches in the T20 World Cup 2024. Teams batting first have won three of these matches, indicating that the pitch might offer some advantage to the team setting a target. This could influence your fantasy team selection, favoring bowlers and middle-order batters.Considering the pitch and player performances, it might be wise to include these bowlers in your fantasy team to maximize your points. Additionally, middle-order batters could also be crucial in accumulating points, as they might have the opportunity to build innings and score well.from the USA has been impressive with four wickets in three matches. His ability to take wickets consistently and keep the runs down makes him a valuable fantasy pick.from South Africa has been in excellent form with nine wickets in four matches, suggesting he could capitalize on the conditions in Antigua.also from South Africa, has taken four wickets in just one match, indicating his potential to be a game-changer in fantasy contests.Aiden Markram (c), Ottniel Baartman, Gerald Coetzee, Quinton de Kock, Bjorn Fortuin, Reeza Hendricks, Marco Jansen, Heinrich Klaasen, Keshav Maharaj, David Miller, Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada, Ryan Rickelton, Tabraiz Shamsi, Tristan Stubbs.Monank Patel (c), Aaron Jones, Andries Gous, Corey Anderson, Ali Khan, Harmeet Singh, Jessy Singh, Milind Kumar, Nisarg Patel, Nitish Kumar , Noshtush Kenjige, Saurabh Nethralvakar, Shadley Van Schalkwyk, Steven Taylor, Shayan Jahangir.

A furious Rauf jumps over a line of street shrub as his wife tries to stop him.Though the video is not clearly audible, Rauf appears to say for the fan that he must be Indian, to which the fan responds that he is a Pakistani.To his credit, the fan stands his ground against a furious Rauf who is stopped by 3-4 more fans who were passing by.On Monday there was a report that Pakistan's skipper Babar Azam and five other players - Mohammad Amir , Imad Wasim , Haris Rauf, Shadab Khan , and Azam Khan - have chosen to spend their holidays in London before going back home.",Haris Rauf allegedly taunted by a fan for Pakistan's poor performance in T20 World Cup.

""He knows how to stand up in big matches, isn't he? That's what makes him really, really special,"" IANS quoted Pathan as saying.""He's a special player and I'm sure he's going to put his hand up and say OK, I'm going to do this for Team India. When the time comes, especially in the big matches, we have always seen Virat Kohli perform. Just wait and watch, the slog sweep will come out now. He will definitely use those shots because, look, those conditions in New York were challenging. But now things will be different, and you'll see a real Virat Kohli coming to the fore.""Pathan's confidence in Kohli is not without reason. The star batsman has consistently performed in crucial moments, and his assertive style during the group matches, although not resulting in substantial runs, suggests a deliberate change in tactics aimed at throwing off the opposition's bowlers from the start.Supporters who have been eagerly awaiting this aggressive approach, similar to his IPL performances, might witness it come to fruition in the match against Afghanistan.Nevertheless, the Indian batting order will have to contend with a daunting spin attack from the Afghan side, spearheaded by the trio of Rashid Khan , Noor Ahmad , and Mohammad Nabi .Ambati Rayudu , a former Indian cricketer, shared his thoughts on the potential strategy India could employ against Rashid, the Afghan spin sensation. Rashid, who underwent surgery after the ODI World Cup 2023, hasn't been at his devastating best since his return to the international arena.""I think the biggest challenge against Rashid Khan is trying to be too aggressive against him. That is where you land in trouble,"" Rayudu explained. ""As a batter, you need to just wait for those loose balls and capitalize on them. After his injury, I don't think his pace is the same. So, you have enough time now, and people have been getting after Rashid. Also, the Indian batsmen know him very well.""Rayudu's examination of Rashid's bowling highlights the need for a calculated strategy when facing the Afghan spinner. By taking advantage of any slight decrease in his speed and pouncing on infrequent mistakes, Indian batsmen may find success against him.This tactical approach, combined with the expected return to form of Kohli, might prove pivotal for India as they confront the spin challenge posed by Afghanistan's bowling attack.",India face Afghanistan in their opening Super Eight stage match of the T20 World Cup 2024 on Thursday in Barbados.

Trott believes this reputation is a compliment to his team’s progress and performance.“It's a compliment, but also earned as well. We've had, as you see in he IPL, we've got a lot of players playing a lot of T20 cricket around the world and now it's about putting that together as a side I think in the past we've had some good individual players, but we need all those players playing together as a side,"" Trott said.Traditionally, Afghanistan have relied on spin bowling, but in this tournament, left-arm pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi has emerged as the standout performer and is currently the top wicket-taker.""When you've got the spinners with the experience of T20 cricket, like we have, I think you would obviously say that's one of our strengths, but yet one of our seamers is a leading wicket-taker in the tournament. So, I think we've seen certainly over the last couple of years a more rounded side.

NEW DELHI: Led by opener Andries Gous' gutsy unbeaten 47-ball 80, a spirited USA gave South Africa a fight before the experienced Proteas managed an 18-run win in their Group 2 Super 8 match at the T20 World Cup in Antigua on Wednesday.With the first win in Super 8s, South Africa earned two points and registered their fifth win on the trot at the this year's cricketing extravaganza.Chasing a challenging 195 on a batting-friendly pitch at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, the USA were stopped at 176 for six in their 20 overs.South African-born Gous put up a valiant fight, especially with his 91-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Harmeet Singh, who scored 38 from 22 balls, featuring two fours and three sixes. The effort, however, could not bridge the gap as the Proteas' bowling attack eventually prevailed.The USA faced a turbulent start, losing Steven Taylor (24 off 14), Nitish Kumar (8), skipper Aaron Jones (0), Corey Anderson (12), and Shayan Jahangir (3) early in their innings.At 76 for five in the 12th over, with another 119 runs required for victory, it seemed a near-impossible task for the newcomers.Gous and Harmeet mounted then a fierce counter-attack in the middle overs, swinging their bats at will and found gaps with precision as South African bowlers, who had almost set up a comfortable win.Harmeet’s aggressive batting, particularly against Tabraiz Shamsi, kept USA’s hopes alive even as the asking rate climbed to about 15 runs per over.However, Rabada's exceptional bowling display, which included three wickets for just 18 runs in his four overs, ultimately turned the tide. His bowling in the penultimate over, which conceded just two runs, was crucial in breaking the USA’s stand and sealing South Africa's win.Earlier in the day, Quinton de Kock played a cracking knock in setting up South Africa’s formidable total. De Kock scored 74 from 40 balls, a display that set the tone for the innings.De Kock's fireworks at the top and skipper Aiden Markram's fluent 46 helped South Africa banish their top-order woes after the frontline batters had flopped collectively in the group stage.The pitch, expected to be slow and spin-friendly, instead saw De Kock putting the USA bowlers to the sword.De Kock's partnership with Markram yielded 110 runs from just 60 balls.Heinrich Klaasen (36 not out) and Tristan Stubbs (20 not out) further boosted South Africa’s total by adding 53 runs unbeaten for the fifth wicket in the final five overs.South Africa did have a cautious start with Reeza Hendricks scoring just 11 before falling victim to Saurabh Netravalkar, who logged figures of 2 for 21 in his four overs.But the partnerships that followed were instrumental in compiling a challenging total of 194 for four in their allotted 20 overs.South Africa, with this win, managed to capture two crucial points, opening their account in the Super Eight stage of the tournament.Despite the USA falling short, their determined fightback, especially the efforts of Gous and Harmeet, made the match a noteworthy contest.",South Africa beat USA by 18 runs in their Group 2 Super 8 match at the T20 World Cup in Antigua on Wednesday.

'Rajasthan State Sports Council and Royals to run RCA Academy',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/rajasthan-state-sports-council-and-royals-to-run-rca-academy/articleshow/111120828.cms,"JAIPUR: After jointly hosting the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) 2024 season here at the Sawai Mansingh (SMS) Stadium, Rajasthan Royals and Rajasthan State Sports Council (RSSC) are all set to enter a new partnership. Speculation is rife that their plan is to run the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) Academy in close collaboration.Multiple sources have also shared that RSSC will not renew the academy contract with former state cricketer Pankaj Singh that will end in August.The Royals’ entry into the set-up comes at a time when the RCA is struggling to get its act together with their coffers lying empty and getting the elections conducted looks a tough task.The RCA is in doldrums since Vaibhav Gehlot resigned as its president in February while RSSC launched an investigation and also sealed the association’s academy and office.It would be interesting to see how things pan out once the RCA elections are conducted. “The new president would want to have the RCA Academy. We will have to wait and watch how things unfold in that scenario,” another source stated.Pankaj’s academy contract to end in August: If sources are to be believed, shutting down Pankaj’s PS Sports Academy at SMS Stadium will disturb the ‘well-set and flourishing structure’. “If the sports council doesn’t renew the contract with Pankaj, the future of around 300 youngsters will be in jeopardy and they will have to look for another alternative. We all know what Pankaj brings to the table and there aren’t any former players of his stature in the state. Also, the coaching staff employed at his academy are a team of credible individuals and it would be tough for the aspiring cricketers to find a better place to hone their skill if this academy is closed, which is also centrally located,” said a source.“It was a 7+3-year contract with Pankaj which allowed him to run his academy inside the SMS Stadium on Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. Seven years will be completed in August and the government is unlikely to extend the contract due to external pressure. That space, most likely, will be given to the highest bidder,” said a source privy to the development.Until now, no clarity has been given to Pankaj and this news might catch him unawares, the source added.Along with the academy at the stadium that was established at the PPP mode, the former Rajasthan captain Pankaj also has his own set-up at Ring Road, Muhana.In May during the IPL, Royals had partnered with Pankaj to open their first academy in the state at the latter’s PS Sports Excellence Arena situated in Muhana.RSSC secretary Sohan Ram Choudhary dismissed the alleged development as ‘baseless conjectures.’ “There is no truth in it. And you will get to know about the contract with Pankaj after we make a decision on it. Right now, we haven’t given it a thought,” Choudhary said.",Rajasthan Royals and Rajasthan State Sports Council (RSSC) are all set to enter a new partnership.

"Rahul Dravid drops a big hint ahead of the Afghanistan game in T20 World Cup, says...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/rahul-dravid-drops-a-big-hint-ahead-of-the-afghanistan-game-in-t20-world-cup-says-/articleshow/111120376.cms,"NEW DELHI: Rahul Dravid , the head coach of the Indian team, hinted at the possibility of selecting either Kuldeep Yadav or Yuzvendra Chahal in the starting lineup for their upcoming T20 World Cup Super Eight encounter against Afghanistan .The match is scheduled to take place on Thursday in Bridgetown, Barbados, and the conditions at the venue appear to favor the spinners.In their previous matches at the Nassau County Stadium in New York, India had primarily depended on their pace bowling attack due to the inconsistent bounce offered by the drop-in pitches, which proved advantageous for the fast bowlers. However, the conditions in Barbados seem to be more suitable for the inclusion of a wrist spinner in the playing XI.""It's tough to leave anyone out. New York had pace bowlers conditions... slightly different. We might need something different here (in Barbados). Yuzi (Chahal) or Kuldeep (Yadav) could be used here,"" said Dravid, while interacting with the media on the eve of theSuper Eight game.""We are lucky to have players with all-round abilities. We had eight batters but we (also) had seven bowling options,"" he added.According to PTI, Dravid also mentioned that the Indian team will adapt their batting order based on the circumstances of the match. He emphasised the importance of being versatile and making adjustments as needed.""Each situation is unique. Can't set it in stone. I believe in flexibility. The Pakistan game we moved Axar (Patel), specifically thinking around it... Rishabh (Pant) up the order (at No. 3), lots of thinking goes into it. I don't think in Tests (cricket), we will have that flexibility. In T20s where it is a lot about match-ups, you see it happening more (flexibility in batting position).""In cricket terminology, a ""match-up"" refers to a situation where a specific bowler or batter dominates a particular player from the opposing team.India found themselves in a precarious position at 19/2, with their top batsmen, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, dismissed early in a critical encounter against their arch-rivals, Pakistan.To counter this setback, the team management made a strategic decision to promote Axar up the batting order to No. 4. In his elevated role, Axar contributed a valuable 20 runs off 18 deliveries, helping to stabilize the Indian innings during the league match.Dravid also expressed his pleasure in arriving at the West Indies for the Super Eights stage of the tournament.""Lovely to come to the Caribbean and play cricket. Couple of practice sessions. We are prepared. Afghanistan are a very dangerous side. Their players play more in leagues than our players. They are not a team to be taken lightly. Deservingly in Super 8.""",Kuldeep Yadav or Yuzvendra Chahal could start for India against Afghanistan. The conditions in Barbados appear to be more suitable for a wrist spinner.

India emerged victorious by a narrow margin of four runs.According to Reddy, The plan was to employ slower balls in the final over bowled by Pooja Vastrakar.Vastrakar's crucial wicket of Nadine de Klerk and her ability to defend 11 runs in the last over were instrumental in India's success. The hosts managed to limit South Africa to 321 for six, after setting a target of 325 for three. This win gave India an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.""The conversation and planning that went into it (final over)... I think after Pooja bowled her first three balls and there was message for her to try the slower one. I think she stuck to that and that's how she got the wicket,"" Arundhati said, as quoted by PTI, during the post-match press meet.Arundhati delivered an impressive penultimate over, conceding just 12 runs, even though De Klerk managed to hit her for a maximum.Arundhati stated she was mentally prepared for that over.""Coming in that over towards the end, I have been used to bowling those overs for DC (Delhi Capitals) in the WPL. I have been prepared for it and I like bowling the tough overs.""Again the focus is more on that. I think if you keep thinking about what went wrong, you will never be able to come back,"" she added.Arundhati mentioned that despite claiming three quick South African wickets at the start of the innings, the team remained focused and didn't let their guard down.""They both (centurions Laura Wolvaardt and Marizanne Kapp ) played quality shots. I don't think we relaxed at any point of time. These things happen during the game.""But what's more important is how you come back. I think, at the end, we won the game. So, I am just happy,"" she added.Kapp, who scored an impressive century, expressed South Africa's self-assurance in pursuing the challenging total, even after losing wickets early in the innings.""We've played here before, so you know how good the wicket is, and everyone likes chasing out here. So, when I joined, I just thought let's try and take it as deep as possible,"" Kapp in the post-match press conference.Kapp expressed her assurance in accumulating more than 100 runs during the final 10 overs of the match.""Even if we have to chase 100 in the last 10, we know it's possible on this outfield and on this wicket.

Who Will Rule The Super 8s? 🏏 360 LIVE #T20WorldCup2024

NEW DELHI: Legendary South Africa batter AB de Villiers believes that for India to emerge victorious in the ongoing ICC T20 World Cup , they must adopt an aggressive approach and ""throw the first punch"" in their matches.On Thursday, India will face Afghanistan in their ICC T20 World Cup Super Eights encounter in Barbados. The Indian team concluded their group stage with an impressive record of three wins in three matches against Ireland, Pakistan, and the USA in Group A, while their final match against Canada was abandoned due to rain.Afghanistan, on the other hand, finished second in Group C, securing three victories and suffering a single defeat against the West Indies.India's primary objective is to break their drought of ICC tournament titles, with their last triumph being the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013, following their successes in the T20 World Cup and the 50-over World Cup in 2007 and 2011, respectively.In recent years, India have come close to winning tournaments, reaching the semifinals and finals, but they have consistently fallen short during the knockout stages.Speaking on his YouTube channel, De Villiers said, ""Just make sure you throw the first punch. In the past World Cups, I think they have been a bit conservative, sort of feeling their way into a game. They are such a quality team that I feel they can take a bit of a risk early in the game to get the momentum because there is no looking back once they get the momentum.""De Villiers believes that star India batter Virat Kohli should occupy the number three position in the batting order during the current ICC T20 World Cup. He regards Kohli as ""the best player in the world during middle overs.""Despite being the highest run-scorer in T20 World Cup history and consistently performing exceptionally well over the years, Kohli has had a disappointing start to the tournament. In his three innings so far, he has scored just 1 run against Ireland, 4 against Pakistan, and a duck against the USA.Two of his dismissals occurred while he was attempting to play aggressively, while in the match against the USA, he was dismissed after poking at a delivery pitched outside the off stump, a weakness that has troubled him frequently in the past.Virat entered the tournament following an outstanding Indian Premier League 2024 campaign with the bat for Royal Challengers Bengaluru, amassing 741 runs in 15 innings at an average of 61.75 and a strike rate of 154.69, including a century and five half-centuries.He also secured the Orange Cap for his exceptional performance. Virat achieved his highest-ever strike rate in his IPL career and displayed remarkable prowess against spinners, adopting a more aggressive approach when facing them.Unfortunately, this attacking strategy proved ineffective on the challenging pitches of Nassau County International Stadium in New York, which faced criticism for its inconsistent bounce and unfavorable conditions for batsmen. As India prepare to play their matches in Barbados, Antigua, and Saint Lucia, Virat will be eager to break his streak of low scores and showcase his newfound style with a significant innings in the West Indies.De Villiers said on Virat, ""I have always said please bat Virat at number three. Especially in better wickets that they will play now, Virat is the go-to guy at number three. He can play the attacking game and also pull back and absorb the pressure if necessary. He is the best player in the world in the middle overs. I do not see any reasons (for opening).""","India will face Afghanistan in their ICC T20 World Cup Super Eights encounter in Barbados.

However, the goal stood after a brief VAR review.Gundogan sealed the win for the hosts in the 67th minute, ensuring Germany's progression to the last 16 as at least one of the best third-placed teams.With a win against Switzerland in their final group match on Sunday, Julian Nagelsmann 's side can clinch the top spot in Group A.Hungary, on the other hand, face the possibility of an early exit from the tournament following two consecutive losses.They must defeat Scotland to have any hope of reaching the knockout stage.

Albania started quickly, as they did against Italy, with Laci scoring in the 11th minute from a Jasir Asani cross.Croatia struggled to impose their passing game, and Albania continued to look more dangerous, with Kristjan Asllani and Rey Manaj missing excellent opportunities to extend their lead.Dalic's half-time substitutions, Luka Sucic and Mario Pasalic, brought about an improvement in Croatia's performance. However, Albania remained a threat on the counter-attack, with Nedim Bajrami going close in the 67th minute.Kramaric finally found the equaliser for Croatia in the 74th minute, cutting inside and finishing into the near post. Two minutes later, Gjasula's own goal appeared to complete the turnaround, but Albania refused to give up.Gjasula made amends by scoring the equaliser in injury time, and both sides threw bodies forward in search of a winner, but to no avail.","Albania held Croatia to a 2-2 draw in a thrilling Euro 2024 group-stage match in Hamburg on Wednesday.

Lionel Messi takes center stage again for Copa America,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/lionel-messi-takes-center-stage-again-for-copa-america/articleshow/111100729.cms,"NEW DELHI: World champions Argentina are set to kick off an expanded Copa America on Thursday, with Lionel Messi aiming to secure a second continental title in what is likely his last appearance in the tournament.The 108-year-old competition, being hosted by the United States, will feature six teams from the CONCACAF region joining the 10 South American nations vying for a spot in the July 14 final in Miami. While FIFA will be closely observing the organization of the event, two years before the World Cup co-hosted by the USA, Canada, and Mexico, the tournament's rich history and prestige ensure it is far more significant than a mere 'trial event'.Argentina have clinched the Copa 15 times, but only once, in 2021, during the Messi era. Coach Lionel Scaloni has largely maintained his World Cup-winning squad, with veterans Angel Di Maria and Nicolas Otamendi likely making their final appearances in a major tournament.It remains uncertain whether this marks Messi's farewell to elite international football . The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, now playing in Major League Soccer with Inter Miami, will celebrate his 37th birthday four days after Thursday's opener against Canada in Atlanta. He has yet to decide if he will attempt to play in a record sixth World Cup.""It's great to have records and continue to achieve things but I won't take part in a World Cup just to say I've done six,"" Messi told ESPN last week.""If I feel good and everything is in place for me to be there, fine, but I won't go just to go. It's very difficult to imagine what can happen because it's still two years away. I don't need to commit right now to whether or not I'll be there,"" he added.Lionel Messi, who has carefully managed his workload to reach peak form for the tournament, would undoubtedly cherish the opportunity to secure a third consecutive major title with Argentina after years of disappointment with his national team.Following their match against Canada, Argentina will face Chile in New Jersey and conclude their group A campaign against Peru in Miami. However, they are well aware of the formidable opposition that awaits them in the knockout stage, with rivals Brazil and Uruguay expected to be the main contenders for the title.Brazil has struggled in the CONMEBOL qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup, having only won two of their first six matches and currently sitting in sixth place in the standings after losses to Uruguay, Colombia, and Argentina.Several familiar names are absent from Dorival Junior's Brazil squad, including Casemiro, Gabriel Jesus, and Thiago Silva , while Richarlison and Neymar are sidelined due to injury.The pressure will be on the Real Madrid attacking duo of Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo to replicate their club form for the Selecao, and there is much anticipation surrounding the senior tournament debut of 17-year-old prodigy Endrick, who is set to join Real next month from Palmeiras.Uruguay, also 15-time winners, has impressed under their 68-year-old Argentine coach Marcelo Bielsa, who has implemented his signature high-energy style and raised expectations with recent victories over Argentina and Brazil. Liverpool forward Darwin Nunez will spearhead the attack, although Bielsa has the option of bringing on veteran Luis Suarez from the bench.Colombia enters the tournament undefeated in over two years, with Liverpool's dynamic winger Luis Diaz posing a constant threat and James Rodriguez experiencing a late-career resurgence. Coach Nestor Lorenzo's team cannot be overlooked.The USA hopes to generate much-needed excitement after losing their way since a respectable run to the last-16 at the World Cup. Coach Gregg Berhalter is under pressure to demonstrate that his team, which relies on Christian Pulisic's intelligent wing play, can compete with teams from outside of CONCACAF.Mexico has frequently participated in the Copa as a guest and reached the final in 1993 and 2001, but they appear to be well below their usual standard, although they can, as always, rely on massive support in the USA.This marks the second time the Copa America is being held in the USA, following the Centenary tournament in 2016. While this deviates from tradition, the presence of significant immigrant communities from all the participating nations should ensure large crowds at the primarily NFL stadiums being utilized.","The 108-year-old competition will feature six teams from the CONCACAF region joining the 10 South American nations vying for a spot in the July 14 final in Miami.

I actually learned that from him, when he was playing, and if a guy was hurt or cramping or something, he'd always use a drop shot or just try and take it up the line.""He added: ""I learned a lot of things watching him play, so it's an honour to share the court with him, but it's just sad that it ended like that.""","Andy Murray forced to retire after just five games due to injury.
