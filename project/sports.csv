India secured a commanding 2-0 victory over Pakistan in the Junior Davis Cup (U-16) on May 24 in Shymkent, Kazakhstan. Indian players Prkaash Sarran and Tavish Pahwa clinched their respective singles matches via super tie-breaks to seal the win.However, controversy erupted three days later when a video from the match surfaced online. It showed a Pakistani player engaging in an unsportsmanlike handshake with his Indian counterpart.After initially missing the handshake, the Pakistani player made contact the second time, only to pull away abruptly in a seemingly disrespectful manner.The Indian player, however, stayed calm and unflustered, showing remarkable composure.This incident came amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, following the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that left 26 people—mostly tourists—dead. In retaliation, India launched precision airstrikes on May 7, targeting nine terror camps linked to groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen in Pakistan and POK, reportedly killing over 100 militants.While India described the strikes as “measured and focused,” Pakistan responded with drone attacks on Indian military installations near the border, triggering a counter-response from India.After three days of cross-border hostilities, both nations agreed to cease fire on May 10.","India secured a commanding 2-0 victory over Pakistan in the Junior Davis Cup (U-16) on May 24 in Shymkent, Kazakhstan.

'Better now than in playoffs': Phil Salt reflects on RCB's first away loss in IPL 2025

In a dramatic IPL 2025 match between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Lucknow Super Giants, a controversial run-out attempt by LSG's Digvesh Rathi at the non-striker's end involving Jitesh Sharma was ruled not out based on MCC Law 38.3, following LSG captain Rishabh Pant 's withdrawal of the appeal. The incident occurred during the final ball of the 17th over when Rathi attempted to run out Sharma at the non-striker's end.The third umpire's decision was grounded in the specific timing of Rathi's attempt to dislodge the bails. Replays showed that Rathi had completed his bowling action and crossed the popping crease before attempting the run-out.The MCC Law 38.3.1 clearly states: ""At any time from the moment the ball comes into play until the instant when the bowler would normally have been expected to release the ball, the non-striker is liable to be run out...""Further technical clarification is provided in Laws 38.3.1.1 and 38.3.1.2, which specify that ""the moment the bowler's arm reaches the highest point of his/her normal bowling action in the delivery swing"" marks the cutoff point for such dismissals.The on-field scene showed Pant and Sharma sharing a sporting moment, with Pant embracing the RCB stand-in skipper after the incident. However, Pant's gesture to withdraw the appeal proved unnecessary as the dismissal was invalid under the rules.The third umpire's review confirmed that Rathi had already completed his bowling action when he attempted the run-out, making the dismissal attempt invalid under current MCC regulations.While Sharma was visibly outside his crease during the incident, the timing of Rathi's attempt to break the wicket was the crucial factor in the decision. The rules specifically require the bowler to attempt the run-out before reaching the highest point of their delivery swing.The match continued after the incident, with RCB successfully chasing down a target of 228 runs with 8 balls remaining in their innings. Jitesh Sharma remained unbeaten, scoring an impressive 85 runs from just 33 deliveries.The incident served as a practical demonstration of the precise application of cricket's laws regarding non-striker run-outs, highlighting the importance of timing in such dismissal attempts.This match marked LSG's final appearance in the 2025 IPL season, with the controversy adding an extra layer of intensity to an already high-scoring encounter.",Jitesh Sharma was run out by LSG's Digvesh Rathi at the non-striker's end during the IPL 2025 match between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Lucknow Super Giants.

Ajinkya Rahane reflects on KKR’s inconsistent IPL 2025, backs under-fire Venkatesh Iyer

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings (PBKS) might just be on the brink of history. With a team that has often flattered to deceive in past editions, the 2025 season has witnessed a turnaround under the leadership of Shreyas Iyer . As of now, PBKS sit comfortably at the top of the Indian Premier League (IPL) points table with 19 points, having won nine matches, lost four, and shared points in one due to a no-result. Their latest statement win, a seven-wicket triumph over Mumbai Indians (MI), have booked them a place in Qualifier 1.Much of the credit for Punjab's consistency this season goes to Iyer, who has not just brought stability to the middle order but has also instilled a sense of direction within the camp. Former India international and JioStar expert Robin Uthappa , speaking on JioHotstar, lauded Iyer's journey and leadership style.""Shreyas has always been an exceptional captain,"" Uthappa remarked.""You always sensed that he felt underappreciated at KKR (Kolkata Knight Riders) despite adding value there. He moved to a franchise where not much had been achieved historically -- and then went on to win it for them. That says a lot about his leadership and belief,"" he added.Iyer's move to Punjab Kings came at a time when his place in the national side was uncertain, and questions were being raised about his long-term future in the IPL but the 2025 season has been nothing short of a personal and professional renaissance for the 30-year-old.Whether it was rotating bowlers smartly, backing youngsters like Arshdeep Singh and Prabhsimran Singh, or taking the game deep with the bat, Iyer has ticked every box.While Punjab Kings are still two wins away from lifting their first-ever IPL trophy, the air around the franchise feels different this year, more assured, more composed and with Shreyas Iyer at the helm, belief is no longer just a buzzword, it's the foundation of what could be a historic campaign.His teammate Shashank Singh highlighted the significant impact Iyer has had on the team culture and environment since taking over the reigns.""Shreyas is a dear friend. I've known him for the past 10-15 years,"" Shashank said after their match against MI at the post-match press conference.""To be very honest, playing under him, with him being the captain, is one of the best things that has happened to me,"" he added.Shashank underlined Iyer's inclusive leadership style, pointing out how the captain's approach extends far beyond the playing eleven.""The way he gives freedom to everyone, not just me, but all 25 members of the squad, including the support staff, content team, media team, logistics, it's truly commendable,"" he noted.","Shreyas Iyer has led Punjab Kings to the top of the Indian Premier League (IPL) points table.

Poll Who was the standout player in the IPL 2025 clash between Lucknow Super Giants and Royal Challengers Bengaluru? Rishabh Pant Mitchell Marsh

More Than a Team: The Rise of CSK & the Whistle Podu Army

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant rediscovered his touch in sensational fashion, smashing a scintillating unbeaten century, while Mitchell Marsh continued his purple patch to power Lucknow Super Giants to a commanding 227 for 3 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru in their IPL 2025 clash on Tuesday.Pant’s explosive 118* off 61 balls (11x4, 8x6) — his first IPL hundred in seven years — was the cornerstone of LSG’s innings, as he and Marsh (67 off 37) stitched together a game-changing 152-run stand for the second wicket. On a batting-friendly pitch, RCB’s erratic bowling only made matters worse for the visitors.Heading into the match, Pant had been under scrutiny for his patchy form — striking at just 107 this season. As LSG’s captain and wicketkeeper, his prolonged struggles had significantly dented the team's campaign.But on this night, the script flipped.Pant found his timing and rhythm with calculated aggression, striking at nearly 200. Once he abandoned the urge to over-hit, the timing naturally returned — and so did the runs.Interestingly, his standout performance came in the absence of franchise owner Sanjiv Goenka, who wasn't at the stadium to witness the carnage. But Goenka was quick to respond on social media, hailing the innings with a succinct post: “‘Pant’astic!”The southpaw’s assault began early.In the fourth over, he took Yash Dayal apart for 18 runs, including a six and back-to-back fours. That burst of intent set the tone, and his confidence rubbed off on Marsh.The Australian all-rounder started cautiously — just 19 off his first 16 deliveries — but then shifted gears with a pulled six off Romario Shepherd. From there, the man known as ‘Bison’ was unstoppable. He brought up his half-century in 31 balls with a six off Suyash Sharma, taking his season tally past 600 runs — his best-ever IPL showing.Pant too notched up his second fifty of the season in 29 balls, dispatching Suyash for two consecutive boundaries.Marsh eventually perished for 67, edging Bhuvneshwar Kumar to wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma — RCB’s stand-in captain for the night as Rajat Patidar remained listed as an Impact Substitute.But Pant remained unflinching.He surged to his century in 54 balls, reaching the milestone with an audacious lofted four over extra cover — a vintage Pant stroke. The celebration was equally electrifying: a beaming smile followed by a trademark backflip.It was a knock that blended flair with maturity. While Pant largely stuck to classical strokes throughout his innings, the century-clinching shot was a reminder of his flamboyant best.He later added a quick 49-run partnership with Nicholas Pooran to cap off LSG’s innings on a high.Though fans may lament the timing of Pant’s return to form, with the league stage nearly complete, the knock brings hope — for LSG’s playoff ambitions and for Pant’s continued resurgence.","Lucknow Super Giants beat Royal Challengers Bengaluru in IPL 2025 clash.

Scott Swift emerges as key figure in shielding Taylor Swift from explosive legal drama

Amid the ongoing legal storm between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni , a new name has come into the spotlight—Taylor Swift’s father, Scott Swift. In a surprising twist, it was Scott who reportedly stepped forward to protect his daughter from being further entangled in the controversy, which centers around Lively’s sexual harassment lawsuit against Baldoni related to the film It Ends With Us.According to court documents cited by the Daily Mail, Taylor Swift's dad, Scott Swift provided crucial information to Justin Baldoni’s legal team. He revealed that Lively had allegedly threatened to leak Taylor Swift’s private text messages unless the pop star publicly supported Lively’s side in the feud. As a result of Scott’s intervention, Taylor was reportedly removed from the legal proceedings altogether.An insider familiar with the situation told the outlet, “Scott Swift did not want his daughter to be dragged into this any further and he voluntarily gave up this information as part of a deal.” The move has been seen by many as a calculated yet protective step by a concerned parent to safeguard Taylor’s reputation and privacy in an increasingly messy legal saga.Court filings by Baldoni’s attorney, Bryan Freedman, assert that Blake Lively’s lawyer, Michael Gottlieb, demanded Taylor’s public support—implying that if she didn’t comply, text messages “of a personal nature” would be released.Lively allegedly also asked Swift to delete their exchanges, suggesting an attempt to erase digital trails.While Lively’s camp has denied any such threats, the judge ultimately ruled that the text message allegations were “improper” and “irrelevant” to the $400 million defamation and extortion lawsuit filed by Baldoni. The result: the subpoena against Taylor Swift was dropped.Adding intrigue to the situation, Taylor’s boyfriend Travis Kelce reportedly unfollowed Ryan Reynolds—Blake Lively’s husband—on Instagram, fueling speculation of loyalty shifts and deepening divisions among the once-close celebrity circle.Taylor Swift, for her part, has maintained her distance. Her representative issued a statement clarifying: “Taylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, and did not see ‘It Ends With Us’ until weeks after its release.”Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce fuels break up rumors as she looks miserable during their date night amid Blake Lively scandal As the drama continues to unfold, it appears that Scott Swift’s quiet but strategic move may have spared his daughter from a high-profile legal entanglement—and possibly protected her legacy.","Scott Swift reportedly provided crucial information to Justin Baldoni's legal team.

Tom Brady thrives post-Gisele Bündchen divorce with Italian flair

Even in retirement, Tom Brady refuses to stay off the scoreboard—on or off the field. Two years after his high-profile divorce from Gisele Bündchen, the NFL legend is rewriting his own playbook, turning heads from Venice, Italy to Las Vegas, Nevada.Recently spotted throwing footballs in the narrow streets of Venice, surrounded by a group of admiring Italian women, NFL legend Tom Brady looked every bit the icon he’s always been. The seven-time Super Bowl champion seemed relaxed and energized—no pads, no stadium, just the streets of Italy and a perfect spiral. The moment felt like a metaphor for his post-NFL life: unconventional, enviable, and still centered around football.While his former partner Gisele Bündchen is forging her own path, Tom Brady’s journey since their 2023 split has been all about reinvention. Beyond becoming the most decorated quarterback in league history, he’s now a powerful media figure and NFL investor.Brady's record-breaking $375 million contract with Fox Sports made waves, solidifying him as the highest-paid sports analyst ever. His debut as a broadcaster was on the grandest stage possible—the Super Bowl—surpassing household names like Greg Olsen and Tony Romo.But Brady’s influence isn’t limited to television. As a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, he’s reportedly taken an active role in shaping the team’s future. The franchise’s recent decisions—including hiring veteran coach Pete Carroll and drafting standout running back Ashton Jeanty—have Brady’s fingerprints all over them. “Tom Brady has already hit a home run with Ashton Jeanty before he takes an NFL snap,” one source noted, hinting at the quarterback's eye for talent and leadership.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s $400M empire: How the supermodel rebuilt her life after divorce with Tom Brady and welcomed baby no. 3 Away from the gridiron, Brady’s life has taken on a new rhythm.

Whether strolling through Venice or navigating the boardrooms of Fox and the Raiders, Brady has entered a new phase of life—one filled with power, wealth, and, perhaps for the first time, leisure.The GOAT may be off the field, but his impact on the game—and pop culture—remains as potent as ever.","Tom Brady is thriving post-divorce, showcasing his influence beyond the NFL.

Steve Kerr talks about the NBA schedule

Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr has indicated that Stephen Curry’s hamstring injury in Game 1 of the NBA's Western Conference semifinals was a result of the tight NBA playoffs schedule, which doesn’t allow players enough time to recover from fatigue. This was Curry’s first hamstring injury in his 16-year-long basketball career and ultimately cost the Warriors the championship. He could have returned to the court to play against the Minnesota Timberwolves, but the team was eliminated too early, before even reaching Game 6.Steve Kerr told Yahoo! Sports’ Tom Haberstroh in the latter’s feature, “I think all the complaints of the wear and tear, and the scheduling, are all valid. But they all fall on deaf ears because of the dollar sign. I don’t think the league’s constituents are willing to give up any money, that’s the problem. But we all know this is not healthy or sustainable if you want guys to survive out there and not have injuries.”The feature includes a conversation Kerr had with Golden State Warriors’ director of sports medicine and performance, Rick Celebrini, about the cause of Curry’s injury.It mentions that when Kerr asked Celebrini, “Do you think Steph pulling his hamstring has anything to do with playing 48 hours after logging 46 minutes of Game 7 in Houston?” Celebrini replied, “One hundred percent.

“You can't give it to people” — Charles Barkley calls out ESPN for making Anthony Edwards face of the NBA after devastating Game 4 performance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/you-cant-give-it-to-people-charles-barkley-calls-out-espn-for-making-anthony-edwards-face-of-the-nba-after-devastating-game-4-performance/articleshow/121452111.cms,"Charles Barkley slams ESPN for calling Anthony Edwards the face of the NBA.

Charles Barkley dismissed Anthony Edwards’ face of the NBA (unofficial) accolade



Face of the NBA? Of course, Minnesota Timberwolves standout Anthony Edwards ’ name pops up, but his recent Game 4 performance against the Oklahoma City Thunder raised some serious questions. Doubters, fans, and analysts quickly dismissed the long-standing claim that Edwards was the face of the NBA. NBA legend Charles Barkley was brutal in his criticism as he straightaway suggested two big names who deserved the unofficial accolade.Charles Barkley didn’t hold anything back Tuesday night when he took aim at ESPN for what he sees as the premature crowning of Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards as the next face of the NBA. Speaking live from Indiana ahead of the Eastern Conference Finals matchup between the Pacers and Knicks, the Hall of Famer issued a stern reality check.“Hey, ESPN, I love you guys. Don’t try to make Anthony Edwards the face of the NBA,” Barkley said on NBA on TNT. “The face of the NBA is Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, [Nikola Jokic] and Giannis. You can't give it to people, they have to take it, and [SGA] is taking it.""That statement came just hours after Edwards had one of the most underwhelming games of his playoff run, scoring only 16 points in the Timberwolves’ heartbreaking 128-126 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder.His 5-for-13 shooting night, including 1-of-7 from deep, stood in stark contrast to the performance delivered by Gilgeous-Alexander, the newly crowned 2025 MVP.In that same Game 4, SGA proved why Barkley holds him in such high regard. The Thunder guard poured in 40 points, grabbed nine boards, dished out ten assists, and snagged a steal, leading OKC to a 3-1 series lead. While not flawless from the field (13-of-30 shooting), his presence was undeniable and decisive.Despite Edwards’ rising profile, he’s a three-time All-Star, a two-time All-NBA Second Team member, and has led Minnesota to back-to-back Western Conference Finals. His recent struggles, however, raise questions about whether he's ready to lead the league both on and off the court.Back in February, when asked if he saw himself becoming the face of the league in the post-LeBron James era, Edwards responded with humility, saying, “Nah, not really. That’s what they got Wemby for.” His answer surprised many and seemed to contradict the ESPN-driven narrative that he’s next in line.Also Read: Anthony Edwards is rewriting NBA playoff history with insane Game 4 numbers Of course, Barkley’s message wasn’t anti-Edwards; it was a reminder of what it takes to truly earn that status. The players he named, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, have all taken their moment, backed it with MVPs, and proved it on the biggest stages.","Charles Barkley slammed ESPN for calling Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards the face of the NBA.

Carl Davis has played for the Baltimore Ravens , Cleveland Browns, Indianapolis Colts, Jacksonville Jaguars, New England Patriots, Seattle Seahawks, and Dallas Cowboys

Carl Davis’ athletic limitations are evident at 33 years old

Carl Davis is showing veteran consistency inside, says Washington Commanders head coach Dan Quinn

Also Read:

Washington Commanders were ranked 13th in total defense in the 2024 NFL season. This screamed for an urgent roster update. And they just announced that update! “Who?”- a fan asked on their X account. The Commanders have signed 33-year-old defensive tackle Carl Davis. Another fan pointed out, “Not mad about it, just wish it didn’t require dropping Jonathan Allen.”According to Scott Jennings from SB Nation Hogs Haven, a Washington Commanders community, Carl Davis wasn’t a priority signing or a starter, but he provided depth later in the season as the team dealt with Jonathan Allen’s injury. Davis was signed to the practice squad three days after Allen’s pec injury and was active for three games during the regular season and during the NFC Championship game when Daron Payne was inactive.33-year-old Carl Davis has been to several NFL teams since his 2015 NFL Draft. First, it was the Baltimore Ravens that drafted him. In his third year of his four-year rookie contract, Davis was waived off by the Ravens in 2018. He entered the Cleveland Browns to finish the last year.For a while, he played for the Indianapolis Colts before shifting to the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2019. Then, in 2020, he played for the New England Patriots for two years from 2020 to 2022.In 2023, Davis became a practice squad member for the Seattle Seahawks. The same year, the Dallas Cowboys signed him for a one-year deal worth $ 1.4 million. But in August 2024, the Cowboys released him.Then, the Washington Commanders entered Carl Davis’ life in October 2024, but he became a practice squad member there. In the 2024 NFL season, Davis played for the Commanders in three games, where he recorded 3 tackles. Davis has accumulated 71 tackles, 2.5 sacks, 3 passes defended, and 1 fumble recovery in 78 career NFL games.According to Dean Jones, Site Expert and Qualified Journalist at Riggo’s Rag, the Washington Commanders brought back a familiar face in the form of Carl Davis. He joined the club last season, playing three games and logging 23 percent of the team’s defensive snaps when active.The former third-round pick out of Iowa is a decent asset against the run. His athletic limitations are evident at 33 years old, but Washington saw enough in the player to warrant another look as preparations gather pace.On May 27, Commanders head coach Dan Quinn shared with David Harrison, Staff Writer at Sports Illustrated,“He’s really showing that veteran consistency inside. He can play square. He’s got size. Getting him into the mix and going, it was right to put that competition up for it. And so, he’s delivered on those ones.

Russell Wilson’s reaction to Ciara’s bold AMAs dress proves he’s her biggest fan



Ciara has never been one to shy away from the spotlight, but her recent appearance at the American Music Awards in Las Vegas proved once again that she knows how to own a red carpet moment—with or without her husband, Russell Wilson, by her side. The 39-year-old singer stunned in a glittering, crystal-embellished dress that had fans and followers buzzing on social media. And while she may have walked the red carpet solo, her NFL star husband didn’t hesitate to let the world know how he felt.Taking to Instagram, Ciara shared a video of her jaw-dropping entrance, captioning it, “Every time I come around ya city… bling bling :) 💎.” The clip, set to Shirley Bassey's timeless “Diamonds Are Forever,” featured her strutting confidently in a figure-hugging, partially see-through gown adorned with dangling crystals and metallic accents. Completing the look with platform heels, stacks of chain necklaces, and flawless blonde waves, Ciara radiated star power from every angle.Russell Wilson, clearly captivated, responded with a heartfelt comment: “No one better. Love you Mrs. Wilson. 👑 @ciara ❤️.” His admiration for his wife’s bold fashion choices isn’t new—it’s part of the couple’s ongoing love story that fans adore. From joking about baby number five when Ciara wore a fierce “lioness” look to Carnival, to his playful complaints about her spicy dance moves, Wilson’s affection has become a beloved fixture in their public appearances.Their bond has always been celebrated, and even when they appear together—like at the recent Knicks vs. Pacers game where they matched in denim—it’s Ciara who often steals the show. Her fashion sense consistently balances edgy with elegance, and her AMAs look was no exception.While Ciara didn’t perform during the awards show, she took the stage to present, later changing into a bold, furry blue ensemble that further highlighted her playful approach to style. As one fan wrote online, “She is everything Russ thinks and says she is!!!” Another added, “This is how you show skin and look classy!”Beyond just looking good, Ciara continues to embody the spirit of a confident, stylish woman unafraid to take risks. Whether she’s in Cannes turning heads or commanding attention in Las Vegas, her fashion choices are as iconic as her music. And with Wilson cheering her on—sometimes a little too enthusiastically—Ciara’s spotlight doesn’t seem to be dimming anytime soon.Also Read: “WHERE TF IS TAYLOR SWIFT?”: Taylor Swift accused of misleading fans after skipping AMAs and staying silent on ‘Reputation (Taylor’s Version)’","Ciara stunned in a crystal-embellished dress at the American Music Awards.

OMG! Taylor Swift & BF Travis Kelce hit the red carpet at the 2025 American Music Awards

While Taylor Swift is getting heat and fan dismay after a total snub at the 2025 American Music Awards, her boyfriend, Travis Kelce , is quietly enjoying time off the grid — and it's not being overlooked. The Kansas City Chiefs' tight end found himself at the center of a viral phenomenon when fans started asking, Where is Travis Kelce today?The American Music Awards 2025 generated controversy on social media when Taylor Swift—in six categories—went home winless. But while Swift avoided the limelight, the internet zeroed in on another central character in her life: Travis Kelce.With Swift missing the event and her romance with Kelce regularly in the foreground of fan discussions, the question “Where is Travis Kelce today?” started trending on platforms such as X and TikTok. The answer? Florida.Kelce was seen last weekend on a low-key outing with his dad, Ed Kelce, in Boca Raton. The pair spent the day at the Restoration Hardware store and were snapped exiting the building. Wearing loose-fitting summer gear — brightly patterned shorts, a white T-shirt, and a red cap — Kelce seemed to be getting a rare break from his intense training regimen.In contrast, Ed Kelce did not overdo it with black shorts, a dark T-shirt, and a brown sun hat. The look provided a short but intimate look at the tight end's off-field, out-of-office life without football or media distractions.Earlier that weekend, Kelce and Taylor Swift also dined together at a posh restaurant in West Palm Beach, where the couple reportedly spent about $400 on their dinner. Swifties were quick to notice that Donna Kelce—Travis's mom—had liked a post featuring photos of the couple's night out, quietly indicating her approval.Back in the NFL, Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid disclosed in an interview with The Athletic last month that Kelce has been ""training like crazy"" to gear up for what might be his last NFL season. Although the tight end hasn't said anything about the award show or Swift's snub, his not attending major public events only heightened fan intrigue.Also read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce fuels break up rumors as she looks miserable during their date night While Travis Kelce has remained mum as Taylor Swift goes through an unusually disappointing night at the awards, his low-profile appearance in Florida says everything about the way the couple is going about letting attention pass them by.

Aaron Rodgers’ latest remarks provide a clear indication of his potential team for the 2025 season

Aaron Rodgers recently signaled his next NFL stop might be the Pittsburgh Steelers for the 2025 season. After leaving the Jets, he playfully dismissed joining the Chicago Bears, but then cryptically noted a team visiting Chicago, aligning with Pittsburgh's schedule. This fuels strong rumors of him joining the Steelers.Aaron Rodgers, the accomplished quarterback, recently provided a cryptic hint about his future in the NFL, intensifying speculation he might join the Pittsburgh Steelers for the 2025 season. This comes as the Steelers have reportedly extended an offer to Rodgers, and the franchise is eager for a decision.Rodgers' tenure with the New York Jets, which saw him contribute 28 scores through the air against 11 turnovers in a 5-12 finish, has concluded, leaving him at a crossroads regarding his next step. His off-season periods are consistently marked by dramatic flair, mirroring his past transitions from the Green Bay Packers to the Jets.His initial aspiration was to rejoin the NFC North, specifically with the Minnesota Vikings. However, with the Vikings having now solidified their quarterback position with J.J. McCarthy, Rodgers' viable paths have narrowed to either joining the Steelers, electing to sit out the season, or formally announcing his retirement.T he most telling clue emerged during an appearance at an event hosted by rapper Mike Stud. When prompted about ever playing for the Chicago Bears, a franchise he has historically dominated with a remarkable 26-5 win-loss record, Rodgers issued a definitive ""No,"" but then appended a provocative observation: ""No, but I believe there's a team that might play in Chicago this year. On a road trip. I don't know. Not sure.""A swift review of the Chicago Bears' 2025 schedule reveals that the Pittsburgh Steelers are indeed slated to visit Soldier Field in Week 12 to face off against Caleb Williams and his squad. This direct correlation strongly implies that Rodgers is on the verge of inking a deal with the Steelers.Such a contest would undoubtedly ignite a fresh chapter in Rodgers' enduring rivalry with the Bears, a team that has consistently been on the receiving end of his prolific performances. The Steelers, with Mason Rudolph currently listed as their primary quarterback, appear eager to bring in an experienced veteran to bolster their roster.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers reignites conspiracy storm, accuses Fauci and U.S. government of engineering HIV Rodgers' signal suggests a deliberate strategy by both player and team. For Pittsburgh, it indicates a commitment to a short-term, high-impact veteran presence over a full youth movement at quarterback. For Rodgers, it's a calculated move to a potentially playoff-contending team, allowing him to bypass rebuilding efforts and potentially make one last deep run, all while continuing his tradition of offseason theatrics.","Aaron Rodgers has hinted at a possible move to the Pittsburgh Steelers for the 2025 season.

Chiefs bet big on rookie rushers– Will Omar Norman-Lott and Ashton Gillotte live up to the hype?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/chiefs-bet-big-on-rookie-rushers-will-omar-norman-lott-and-ashton-gillotte-live-up-to-the-hype/articleshow/121453669.cms,"Chiefs' bet big on rookie rushers (Image via AP)

Praised by coaches and execs, the rookie rushers are emerging as a high-motor weapon up front

As the reigning champions gear up for another title run, the Kansas City Chiefs are putting their trust in young, high-motor defenders to elevate their already formidable defense. Among the most talked-about rookies is Omar Norman-Lott along with Ashton Gillotte whose relentless energy and pass-rushing potential have earned them early praise from both coaches and teammates.Quarterback Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs coaching staff have taken note of the intensity and upside shown by the rookie defensive class, which includes Omar Norman-Lott, Felix Anudike-Uzomah, and Ashton Gillotte. Their ""relentless"" approach is seen as a sign of the team’s bright defensive future.Norman-Lott, at 6-foot-2 and 291 pounds, brings explosiveness, quickness, and nonstop motor to the interior line, an area that has struggled to maintain pressure without Chris Jones on the field. During his two years at Tennessee, after transferring from Arizona State, he notched 44 tackles and 9.5 sacks, standing out as a disruptive force in the middle.His impact hasn’t gone unnoticed by Chiefs insiders. “You can never have enough of them,” said Chiefs executive Terry Bradway. “I think Omarr with his inside rush and Ashton just with his versatility, we thought those guys are just too hard to find.”Former Chiefs defensive end Leger Douzable emphasized the team’s need for someone like Norman-Lott, “He fills a big need. That twitch and pass-rush potential from the interior—outside of Chris Jones, Kansas City just didn’t have it.”Ashton Gillotte brings burst and flexibility off the edge, standing out at the NFL Combine with elite speed-power traits. His quick hands, low pad level, and leverage make him a high-upside prospect. A shared college D-line coach with Karlaftis could ease his transition into the Chiefs' system.Gillotte made serious noise in 2023, delivering a breakout performance that turned heads across the league. Over 14 games, he racked up 11 sacks and led his team with 10 tackles for loss, showcasing both consistency and game-changing ability. His mix of speed, power, and awareness made him a constant threat off the edge.Chiefs executive Terry Bradway summed it up perfectly, calling Gillotte “the total package” a rare compliment for a rookie, and one that hints at the high expectations the team already has for him. ""This kid plays a hundred miles an hour,"" he said. ""He's everything you want in a football player. From makeup to how he plays the game ... the guy is absolutely relentless.""Also read: “That’s the most loser mentality chant”: Jason Kelce slams U.S. soccer chants, Travis Kelce backs fiery new motto With a growing defensive identity rooted in youth and aggression, both Norman-Lott and Gillotte could be a key piece in helping the Chiefs sustain their dominance on both sides of the ball.","The Kansas City Chiefs are putting their trust in young, high-motor defenders to elevate their already formidable defense.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

Star defender to miss spring workouts after calf injury during OTAs

The Buffalo Bills have encountered an early hurdle in their preparations for the upcoming NFL season, as newly signed edge rusher Joey Bosa has been ruled out of offseason training activities due to a calf injury. This development could delay key adjustments in a defense that was expected to be reinforced by the veteran's arrival.Joey Bosa, a former cornerstone of the Los Angeles Chargers' defense, signed a one-year deal reportedly worth $12.6 million with the Bills this offseason. The move was seen as a strategic boost to the team’s defensive unit, which aims to support quarterback Josh Allen in what is considered a crucial season for Buffalo’s Super Bowl hopes.The 29-year-old suffered the injury during Organized Team Activities (OTAs), a non-contact training period that sets the foundation for training camp in July. While the team expects Bosa to return in time for full camp, his absence over the next several weeks is being viewed with concern, especially given his recent injury history.Over the past three seasons, Bosa has missed significant time due to various physical setbacks, including groin and foot issues.The current injury raises questions about his durability and whether the Bills will be able to rely on him through out a demanding 17-game regular season.In his absence, Buffalo is expected to turn to younger edge rushers such as Greg Rousseau, A.J. Epenesa, and Michael Hoecht, along with rookie Landon Jackson, to fill the void. While these players have shown potential, none bring the same level of experience or proven impact that Bosa was expected to deliver.Also read: Chiefs bet big on rookie rushers– Will Norman-Lott and Ashton Gillotte live up to the hype? The Bills, who have made deep playoff runs in recent years but have yet to reach the Super Bowl under Allen, are operating under mounting pressure to capitalize on their championship window.

With training camp still weeks away, the Bills remain hopeful of Bosa’s recovery. However, the latest injury underscores the unpredictability of preseason preparations and the importance of roster depth heading into the 2025 NFL campaign.","Joey Bosa has been ruled out of offseason training activities due to a calf injury.
