'Cannot support all his beliefs': Tharoor calls himself 'uncritical fan' of Nehru; slams BJP for turning him into 'convenient scapegoat',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cannot-support-all-his-beliefs-tharoor-calls-himself-uncritical-fan-of-nehru-slams-bjp-for-turning-him-into-convenient-scapegoat/articleshow/126426866.cms,"Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor (PTI file photo)

Nehru Catered To Liaquat Ali Khan, Ignored Somnath History: BJP MP Sudhanshu Trivedi

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader and MP Shashi Tharoor on Thursday once again appeared to strike a balanced tone. While expressing respect for the country's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru , and calling him the founder of Indian democracy, Tharoor also said it was necessary to acknowledge Nehru's mistakes, adding that blaming him alone for India's problems is unjustified.Speaking at the fourth edition of the Kerala Legislative Assembly International Book Festival (KLIBF), Tharoor spoke on the BJP government's treatment of Nehru's legacy.""I am a fan of Jawaharlal Nehru, but not an uncritical fan. I greatly admire his mind and outlook, and I have deep respect for him, though I cannot support all his beliefs and policies 100%. Many of the things he did deserve the highest appreciation. Most importantly, it was Nehru who firmly established democracy in India... I would not say that they (the Modi government) are anti-democratic, but they are certainly anti-Nehru. Nehru has been turned into a convenient scapegoat,"" he said.Recalling the 1962 India–China war, the Thiruvananthapuram MP said, ""In some cases, their (Modi government's) criticism may have a basis. For instance, the 1962 defeat against China can partly be attributed to some of Nehru’s decisions.""He then turned his focus to the ruling BJP, adding, ""But what they do now is blame Nehru for everything, regardless of the issue.""In recent times, Tharoor's stance and political alignment have come under close scrutiny. Unlike many other party leaders, he does not always adhere to strict partyline statements, often appearing less comfortable with unquestioned loyalty to the Congress high command.Reflecting on his journey as a writer, Tharoor said his love for reading began in childhood due to asthma. With no television or mobile phones, books became his constant companions.He revealed that he wrote his first novel at a very young age, though it was later lost to an ink spillage. His biography of Sree Narayana Guru marks his 28th book.Tharoor also mentioned that while reading habits are declining globally, Kerala continues to lead in reading culture. He said he wrote ""The Great Indian Novel"" in 1989 as a satirical work, a genre that was largely absent in India at the time.Addressing the younger generation, Tharoor suggested that shorter books with fewer pages may be more appealing to readers who struggle to find time. He also fondly recalled his college days at St Stephen’s College, Delhi, remembering a stage production where he played Antony while filmmaker Mira Nair portrayed Cleopatra.","Senior Congress leader and MP Shashi Tharoor spoke at the fourth edition of the Kerala Legislative Assembly International Book Festival.

JAMMU: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Thursday assured that the first batch of 50 students selected for admission to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence (SMVDIME) in Reasi would not be allowed to suffer because of NMC’s withdrawal of permission to run the MBBS course. The government would accommodate the students in other institutions through supernumerary seats, he said.“We will adjust them by creating supernumerary seats in colleges close to their homes so that their education does not suffer,” the CM told media persons on the sidelines of a function in Jammu. It was the govt’s responsibility to accommodate the students, he said, adding that this was not a difficult task and had been “discussed thoroughly”.Supernumerary seats are additional seats created over and above the approved intake in an educational institute.Omar has been critical of the agitation spearheaded by Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Sangharsh Samiti against 42 Muslim students, mostly from Kashmir, being granted admission to the Jammu-based medical institute funded by Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board, as against only seven Hindus. He reiterated that the students got admission on merit as the selections were based on NEET scores.The NMC order on withdrawal of permission cited SMVDIME’s non-adherence to minimum standards as the reason. In a reference to that, Omar said accountability must be fixed if standards were not maintained at the medical institute. “We will accommodate these 50 students, but someone must answer for the damage done to students’ futures,” he said.Responding to questions on inspections by NMC and the medical college’s non-compliance with norms, he said: “You should question the university and its office-bearers from top to bottom — why, after building a medical college, did it fail to pass inspection?”The CM also interacted with the J&K Under-16 cricket team that clinched the Vijay Merchant Trophy (Plate Group) for the first time. Congratulating the team on their remarkable feat, he said, “Your victory reflects not just talent, but teamwork, discipline and dedication. You have made the entire J&K proud.”Omar presented an appreciation trophy to the victorious team, led by Smagey Khajuria. J&K defeated Mizoram by an innings and 182 runs to lift the trophy in Surat on Jan 6.","Omar has been critical of the agitation spearheaded by Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Sangharsh Samiti against 42 Muslim students, mostly from Kashmir, being granted admission to the Jammu-based medical institute.

A promising trade now clouded by injuries and off-field questions

Washington Commanders cornerback Marshon Lattimore is facing renewed scrutiny after being arrested on Wednesday evening in suburban Cleveland on weapons-related charges. The incident has quickly drawn attention not only because of Lattimore’s profile as a former Pro Bowl defender but also due to his recent struggles to stay healthy and productive since arriving in Washington.Lattimore was taken into custody in Lakewood, Ohio, around 6:15 p.m. after police stopped a vehicle for expired license plates and additional traffic violations. According to authorities, Lattimore was a passenger in the car and failed to inform the officer about a firearm inside the vehicle when asked. He was charged with carrying concealed weapons and improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle. Lattimore was briefly booked into jail before being released without bond.A Commanders spokesperson acknowledged the situation, saying, “We have informed the NFL League Office and have no further comment at this time.” Team officials are continuing to gather details as the league monitors the case, which could lead to further review under the NFL’s personal conduct policy.The arrest comes at a time when the Commanders are evaluating their roster direction and waiting for injured veterans to prove their long-term value.While the legal process is still unfolding, the situation adds another layer of uncertainty to a player once viewed as a cornerstone acquisition for the franchise.As fans know, this is not Lattimore’s first encounter with law enforcement. In 2021, while playing for the New Orleans Saints, he was arrested in Cleveland during a traffic stop involving a loaded handgun that had been reported stolen. Court records show he later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor concealed weapon charge, receiving a suspended sentence and one year of probation.On the field, Lattimore’s Washington tenure has been a bumpy one. He was acquired in a November 2024 trade that initially earned praise for general manager Adam Peters. However, injuries have defined his time with the team, as he managed just two regular-season appearances last year and struggled early this season before landing on injured reserve in November with a torn ACL.Also read: Marshon Lattimore injury update: Washington Commanders cornerback ready to play with positive health report","Washington Commanders cornerback Marshon Lattimore was arrested on weapons- related charges.

Kyle Tucker could “dramatically boost” New York Mets’ World Series push

Kyle Tucker has suddenly become a big name to watch in Major League Baseball free agency. On January 7, 2026, MLB insider Will Sammon reported that the New York Mets are closely watching Kyle Tucker. The team believes adding him could “dramatically boost” their World Series hopes after missing the playoffs in 2025.The New York Mets were expected to spend heavily this winter. So far, they have focused mostly on pitching and added infielder Jorge Polanco. But now, people inside the league say the Mets could shift gears fast if Kyle Tucker becomes available at the right price.Kyle Tucker is one of the most respected outfielders in baseball. He is a four-time All-Star and known for his power, calm hitting style, and strong arm.According to Will Sammon, writing on January 7, 2026, the New York Mets already like their roster. But they believe Kyle Tucker could take it to another level.“Unlike a vocal segment of the New York Mets’ fan base, club officials view their roster as strong,” Sammon wrote. “Reeling in a star like free-agent outfielder Kyle Tucker, however, would dramatically boost the team’s World Series odds.”This interest comes after a painful 2025 season in New York. The Mets were in playoff position late in the year but collapsed in the second half and missed the postseason.That ending pushed the front office to look for a true difference-maker. The Mets are not alone. The Los Angeles Dodgers, who have won the last two World Series, are also linked to Kyle Tucker.The Toronto Blue Jays are in the mix as well. Sammon reported that the Mets prefer a shorter contract with a very high yearly salary, while the Blue Jays are open to offering more years.He added that the Dodgers “loom as a contender,” given their history of landing stars. Around the league, some executives believe Kyle Tucker could command a deal near $400 million, depending on length and structure.While Kyle Tucker draws attention, Cody Bellinger is also shaping the outfield market. This week in New York, multiple reports said the New York Yankees sent Cody Bellinger a second contract offer.The team is still looking to strengthen its lineup after falling short of a championship run. Jomboy Media’s Chris Rose spoke about the situation and believes Cody Bellinger and his agent, Scott Boras, are focused on a long-term deal.“I think they’re chasing years,” Rose said. He added that a five-year deal worth around $30 million per season would not surprise him.Cody Bellinger has rebuilt his value with steady hitting and strong defense. The Yankees see him as a fit for both the outfield and first base, giving them flexibility.Talks are ongoing, and no final decision has been made. For now, both Kyle Tucker and Cody Bellinger remain free agents.But as January moves forward, teams in New York, Los Angeles, and Toronto are watching closely.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: Ketel Marte Trade Buzz Grows As New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, And Los Angeles Dodgers Watch Arizona Diamondbacks","Kyle Tucker is a four-time All-Star and known for his power, calm hitting style, and strong arm.

Taylor Swift is reportedly scared of Travis Kelce's controversial past, ahead of their wedding

Taylor Swift’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, is speculated to be retiring this season

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have had a pretty hard time this season as the Kansas City Chiefs have recorded a pretty average performance on the field this time.With the season coming to an end now, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce seem to be focused on their wedding. But there is something that is reportedly bothering the billionaire pop star.A few weeks ago, Travis Kelce had confessed on his popular podcast, New Heights, about the time he was suspended when he was caught with marijuana in college.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.It seems Taylor Swift is really bothered by this confession. As per Radar Online, a source has revealed that, ""Taylor hates that this has become a talking point again.She's spent years crafting a clean, family-friendly image, and she's terrified that something from Travis's past could smear that.""A second source added, ""She's incredibly proud of how hard he's worked to turn his life around – but this story coming back up makes her feel exposed.”The source continued, “Taylor's brand thrives on control and positivity, and this just isn't part of that narrative.""However, neither Taylor Swift nor Travis Kelce has responded to these speculations as they continue to be tight lipped about their wedding.Travis Kelce has confessed that he had to go to a therapist after the marijuana incident in college.The popular tight end said, ""I had to sit down with a shrink for an hour a week…”Travis Kelce added, ""He got me to look at my life way more strategically.

Stefon Diggs and Cardi B’s nonstop drama emerges as a growing Patriots distraction ahead of the NFL playoffs despite Drake Maye’s elite MVP form,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/stefon-diggs-and-cardi-bs-nonstop-drama-emerges-as-a-growing-patriots-distraction-ahead-of-the-nfl-playoffs-despite-drake-mayes-elite-mvp-form/articleshow/126404396.cms,"Stefon Diggs, Cardi B (Getty Images)

New England Patriots face growing Stefon Diggs distraction before playoffs

The New England Patriots are winning games again, but the noise around them refuses to fade quietly. Foxborough has always known how to handle pressure. What feels new is how often football headlines now compete with celebrity drama. Inside the building, optimism runs high around a second-year quarterback who already looks like the future of the franchise. Outside it, the conversation keeps drifting toward social media clips, relationship rumors, and tabloid-style chaos that threatens to pull attention away from the field.That contrast defines this Patriots season. On one end is the wholesome image of Drake Maye’s inner circle, led by Ann Michael Maye, whose viral moments feel harmless and community driven. On the other is a constant swirl around Stefon Diggs and his superstar partner Cardi B, a storyline that never seems to cool down for long. The disconnect tests the calm culture Mike Vrabel is trying to protect.The uncomfortable truth is that the New England Patriots need Stefon Diggs, even when the attention becomes exhausting. Strip away the drama and the numbers tell a blunt story. Diggs was the engine of the passing attack, finishing with 1,013 receiving yards. No other wide receiver came close. Kayshon Boutte trailed by 462 yards, while tight end Hunter Henry ranked second overall with 768.Without Diggs’ explosiveness, Drake Maye’s ceiling drops fast.That is why patience exists where it normally would not. If Diggs carried a lower profile, the tolerance would likely be gone already. But playoff football is ruthless, and Maye needs a receiver who can flip momentum in a single snap if the Patriots want a legitimate Super Bowl push.The latest Diggs and Cardi B episode arrived at the worst possible moment, just as the postseason began. The rap icon clapped back at Diggs’ most recent accuser, extending a pattern that has followed the team all year, even after the couple welcomed their newborn son in November. It makes for viral content, not ideal preparation for chasing a Lombardi Trophy.That context made the Patriots’ timing feel deliberate when they released a mic’d up sideline exchange.""I can throw some blocks if you need,"" Diggs quips.""You need to shut the f**k up,"" Vrabel retorts.The exchange came across as playful, almost reassuring. The message was clear. Diggs is engaged. Vrabel is in control. Rookie lineman Will Campbell later praised Vrabel’s ability to connect with different personalities, reinforcing the idea of unity.Still, even the strongest coaches grow weary of constant off-field noise. As the Chargers loom in the Wild Card round, the Patriots know one thing for certain. Talent wins games, but distractions have ended more than a few championship dreams. Whether this one proves manageable will define how far New England Patriots really goes.Also Read: John Harbaugh's future: 3 possible landing spots for former Ravens' coach","New England Patriots face growing Stefon Diggs distraction before playoffs.

Corey Perry placed on non-roster status by Los Angeles Kings

On Wednesday, the Los Angeles Kings said that forward Corey Perry had been given non-roster playing status, which means he can leave the team to deal with a family issue, and the company said that Perry is going home because someone in his family is sick, but they didn't say when he would be back or give any other details.The news comes at a very important time in the NHL season, when the Kings are trying to get into the playoffs in the Western Conference, and Perry's absence is a big change for the team because he has been a key part of the Kings' lineup as a veteran player and a competitive edge, and this news quickly made its way into the latest NHL news roundup, which got a lot of attention from fans all over the league.Corey Perry signed a one-year, $3.5 million contract with the Los Angeles Kings ahead of the 2025–26 campaign after his stint with the Edmonton Oilers. The 40-year-old forward missed the opening weeks of the season due to a preseason knee injury but returned to make a strong impact. In 35 games, Perry registered nine goals and 12 assists for 21 points, placing him among the team’s top contributors alongside Anze Kopitar.Following Perry’s departure, the Los Angeles Kings recalled forwards Andre Lee and Taylor Ward from their American Hockey League affiliate, the Ontario Reign, on an emergency basis.The call-ups are intended to provide immediate depth as the team prepares for upcoming NHL matchups during a tight schedule.Los Angeles currently sits in a Wild Card position in the Pacific Division, making every NHL match today crucial. While Perry’s time away is unrelated to on-ice performance or injury, his leadership will be missed in the dressing room. The Kings organization and fans alike have expressed support, with hopes that Perry will return once his personal situation allows. The organization emphasized privacy and support, asking fans to respect Perry and his family during this time.Also Read: Brad Marchand’s lifestyle: Inside Florida Panthers star’s early life, NHL career, and personal adventures","Corey Perry placed on non-roster status by Los Angeles Kings.

Hailey Summers remains Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s steadfast supporter

In the blinding lights of an arena, people often forget to celebrate those who stood with them through thick and thin. But Oklahoma City Thunder superstar Shai Gilgeous-Alexander continues to prove otherwise. Following a 2024 season that was no less than a dream come true, Shai is riding the wave high in NBA.

So, when Shai went up on the stage to receive the 2025 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year award, he knew his support system deserved an equal recognition. “I also want to dedicate this to my beautiful wife, Hailey. She’s my rock…I never want to be between a rock and a hard place, but as long as I’m with my Rock, it will never be a hard place,"" said SGA during his acceptance speech.He added, “I figured I’d say something witty about her cause last time I got emotional, and I cried on stage for like 10 minutes. Thank you for everything that you continue to do and the sacrifices made for me and my family.”While the Thunder continue their pursuit of a championship, Shai made it clear that his priorities are firmly rooted at home.

Ric Flair’s net worth in 2025 and what it reflects

Ric Flair’s wrestling career, earnings, and endorsements

Ric Flair is still one of the most famous names in the history of wrestling. Well into his post-ring prime decades later, the “Nature Boy” still draws eyes with appearances, branding agreements, and a seemingly never-ending coverage of his life and career. But as legendary as he is, Flair's net worth in 2025 paints a much more complex picture than many fans would expect.Years ago, Flair made millions when wrestling boomed, but behind the scenes, financial realities have changed his wealth. A combination of medical expenses, lifestyle spending, and failed business ventures. Combined, they tell the tale of why one of wrestling's all-time greats is often associated with a surprisingly small fortune in his name to this day.One of the finest WWE wrestlers in the world today, Ric Flair’s net worth in the year 2025 is reported close to around $500,000. That number is especially notable for a competitor who held world championships with various promotions and headlined dozens of major events. Thus, financial analysts and wrestling historians alike attribute this to a mixture of high personal expenses during his prime, numerous divorces, and huge medical expenses after a few health crises.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Even Flair has been open about living the high life, which matched what fans saw on TV. We made this point before, that image solidified his spot in cultural history, but also boxed in his long-term wealth compared to some other big-name athletes who took a more traditional investment approach.Flashy Ric Flair character through NWA, WCW, and WWE, a 16-time world champion, and a two-time Hall of Famer. Flair made a great deal of money throughout his career from top payouts, television, merchandise, and advertising.His income increased after wrestling through endorsements and licensing deals. The guy's visage and catchphrases have graced clothing, collectibles, energy drinks, and pop culture crossovers. Of course, contracts back in the wrestling days sometimes restricted long-term royalties, so a great deal of those nostalgically iconic moments may not have earned the same continuously rolling money as fans might expect.Over the past several years, Flair has embraced brand-forward initiatives. They've ranged from restaurant concepts and cannabis partnerships to drink collaborations, all of which leverage his name for a new generation. In reality, a handful of projects picked up hype early on, while other projects deal with existential crises due to operational complexity or public outcry.Also Read: Bron Breakker and Izzy Dame combined net worth: WWE contracts, endorsements, brand deals, and more","Ric Flair’s net worth in the year 2025 is reported close to around $500,000.

Chloe Kim injury update ahead of Olympic qualification



Chloe Kim's Olympic hopes face test after training setback



Chloe Kim’s push toward another Olympic moment hit sudden uncertainty after a hard fall during training in Switzerland. The two-time Olympic gold medalist dislocated her shoulder while preparing for a crucial tune-up event ahead of the 2026 Winter Games in Italy. The qualification run is approaching fast, and Kim’s latest injury sparks concerns.The 25-year-old shared a video of the crash from Laax, where she lost control early in a run and slid across the halfpipe. Kim confirmed she is waiting on medical clarity, including an MRI scheduled for Friday, as she tries to stay ready for a qualification round set for February 11.Chloe Kim addressed the injury directly on social media, explaining how a routine session turned serious. “I hate that I have to make this video,” she said. “I took the silliest fall ... and that ultimately resulted in me dislocating my shoulder.”She did not specify which shoulder was affected and admitted the uncertainty remains heavy. “I don’t have much clarity now,” Kim said while stressing she is trying to stay optimistic about competing. Her update offered measured relief alongside concern.“The positive thing is, I have range, I’m not in that much pain, I just don’t want it to keep popping out, which has happened,” she said.“I’m just trying to stay really optimistic. I feel really good about where my snowboarding is at right now, so I know the minute I get cleared and I’m good to go, I should be fine.”Kim added that rest is now the priority. “The only thing I can do is rest/do everything in my power to come back as soon as possible,” she wrote, closing with a light moment, “p.s. I think I am getting old.”Kim is aiming to become the first action sports athlete to win three Olympic gold medals. Shaun White achieved three halfpipe titles across five Games, while Kim has a chance to do it consecutively. Her résumé certainly supports the ambition.She burst onto the Olympic stage in 2018 with gold in Pyeongchang and repeated the feat in Beijing in 2022. Over the years, she has reshaped the sport with historic tricks, including becoming the first woman to land a 1260 in competition and earlier setting milestones with double corks and back to back 1080s.Kim earned her place on the U.S. team by winning a major contest last year and has followed a lighter competition schedule this season. She previously withdrew from a final in Colorado after another shoulder issue that was not considered serious at the time.The Laax Open is scheduled for next weekend; however, her participation remains uncertain. Even with medical clearance, Kim may enter the Olympics without reaching a contest final this season.","Two-time Olympic gold medalist Chloe Kim dislocated her shoulder during training.

NHL Trade Rumors: Will New York Rangers’ Artemi Panarin and Edmonton Oilers’ Andrew Mangiapane be trade targets before deadline?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-will-new-york-rangers-artemi-panarin-and-edmonton-oilers-andrew-mangiapane-be-trade-targets-before-deadline/articleshow/126421498.cms,"Artemi Panarin (Image Via Getty Images)

Why Artemi Panarin could be on move for New York Rangers

the NEW YORK RANGERS have to TRADE Artemi Panarin...

All The Latest Trade Rumours On Andrew Mangiapane...

Artemi Panarin is once again the center of attention while the New York Rangers deal with difficulties in the Eastern Conference. The team, which has been experiencing mixed results and injuries to its key players such as Igor Shesterkin and Adam Fox, is under pressure to make a move that will affect its playoff chances. The very move that the General Manager Chris Drury is going to make is what has the fans and analysts’ eyes glued on him.On the other hand, the Edmonton Oilers have been accompanied by their own difficulties. Mangiapane and Frederic, the forwards, have not been able to get back on track and produce what is expected from them. The management is left with the dilemma of pursuing trades, buyouts, or other roster adjustments. Both players are protected from being traded, which adds to the complications in the decision-making for the Oilers.Vincent Z. Mercogliano of The Athletic reports that the injury to Shesterkin may drive the Rangers into trade deadline activity quicker than anticipated. Sources from the NHL, including James Murphy of RG.Org, suggest that Drury shall deal one of his stars if the team’s output does not get better. Among those whose trades are being talked about are Artemi Panarin, Mika Zibanejad, and Vincent Trocheck, all the while, contract stipulations and cap considerations might limit the options.Panarin, being a UFA-eligible player, has a higher appeal for the contenders who want a short-term boost, but his no-movement clause will further restrict the teams that he can go to.The Rangers have also been rumored to be looking to add forwards, and Kiefer Sherwood from the Vancouver Canucks has been mentioned as a possible target. The $1.5 million salary cap hit of Sherwood is not burdensome, and his two-way play makes him a good candidate; however, his age and Vancouver’s price tag may dictate the direction of the negotiations.At the same time in Edmonton, Gerry Moddejonge from the Edmonton Journal pointed out that Mangiapane and Frederic might be traded if their performance doesn’t improve. Frederic might even get a summer buyout, while Mangiapane’s poor scoring still makes him a trading candidate.The NHL trade deadline is indeed turning out to be the most vital one for each team due to injuries and underperformance that are a common denominator for both the Rangers and the Oilers. The choices made in the forthcoming weeks will not only change the line-ups but might also affect the teams' chances of making the playoffs, thus keeping the fans and the analysts in the state of the highest alert.Also Read: Connor McDavid’s Edmonton Home: Inside Hockey’s most talked-about residence","The NHL trade deadline is turning out to be the most vital one for each team due to injuries and underperformance.

Candace Parker shares why NBA players value her insights in a league dominated by men

Candace Parker once faced backlash from Josh Hart over her critical comments on Jalen Brunson

The NBA is a male-dominated league, and so are its players, one might think. Former WNBA star, Candace Parker has called for the NBA games in a recent occurrence of events. She addressed how the NBA stars might have paid their heartfelt respect for the retired WNBA star when she talks about their game. She appeared during a podcast hosted by Dwyane Wade.The Miami Heat star just wanted to know her opinion regarding the same. Parker spilled the beans just at the right moment and said how she always speaks, citing proper facts. She is considered the greatest of all time in the WNBA and has been a three-time WNBA Champion. She was also the 1st overall draft pick in 2018. Let us dive deep into the conversation between Parker and the Heat star, Dwyane Wade.Earlier in the podcast, “Wy Network,” hosted by Dwyane Wade, Candace Parker was invited to share her valuable insights about everything that has been going on both in the big leagues as well as in the WNBA. But one thing led to another, and the term “respect” came up, where Wade asked Parker if she felt that the NBA stars respected her opinion on their games. She said, “I think so, and here's the thing with respect, I think.Your opinion or you agreeing with what I see may not always be aligned”.“But the respect is what you seek because I wanna come with facts. Now, do we live in a time where everything is like black and white? No, there's a grey area as well”, Candace Parker continued. “But I hope when I come with the black and white facts, that I'm coming with tape, I'm coming with reasons, I'm coming with facts. And that's the way I always try to approach it, where I see something but I need something else to back it up”.One of the greatest players of all time in the WNBA, Candace Parker, once faced a significant downturn from the former basketball player, Josh Hart, for taking a subtle jab at Jalen Brunson. She commented on how Brunson is not an A1 player, for which she has received negative comments from Hart on X. She said, “As a number one option, last year in the playoffs, great first round, second round not so much”.Replying to this tweet, Josh Hart wrote, “Shows you some of them don't actually watch basketball”, to which even actor Ben Stiller agreed. Now, if you look at Brunson’s record, he has averaged 31 points, 6.3 assists, and 5.5 rebounds per game while playing for the Knicks in 2023, and that proves how good a player Brunson is. So the NBA stars taking a negative shot on Parker is justified to every point.Also read: ""They Let Her Get Away With It"" - WNBA Legend Candace Parker rips into the WNBA’s officiating bias after Napheesa Collier's incident","Candace Parker once faced backlash from Josh Hart over her critical comments on Jalen Brunson.

"“As a coach, it’s hurting the kids”: Jimbo Fisher slams Lane Kiffin over Ole Miss staff controversy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/as-a-coach-its-hurting-the-kids-jimbo-fisher-slams-lane-kiffin-over-ole-miss-staff-controversy/articleshow/126421195.cms,"“As a coach, it’s hurting the kids”: Jimbo Fisher slams Lane Kiffin over Ole Miss staff controversy

Transfer portal turmoil looms over Ole Miss ahead of semifinal clash



Jimbo Fisher is tired of the Lane Kiffin Show at Ole Miss, as Kiffin, with the main reason, is no longer the Rebels' coach. Fisher, a former Florida State coach who won a national championship and taught at Texas A&M from 2018 to 2023, aimed at the former Rebels coach in a famous tirade.Fisher said Wednesday on the ACC Network, “It’s selfish, that’s what it is. It’s stupid,” One day before Ole Miss's College Football Playoff (CFP) quarterfinal matchup with Miami.“Here’s why I say that. He wanted to coach and thought he didn’t get his way. ‘So, everybody get on the plane with me, or you don’t have a job.”He makes them all go. Then, because it appears that you don't truly care about the children, he goes down there and takes a PR hit.Kiffin left Ole Miss late last year to take a position at LSU, bringing several assistant coaches with him.If all the outgoing coaches had departed at that point, the Rebels would have been left with a bare-bones coaching staff for the CFP, which would have prompted Kiffin to eventually relent and allow his assistants to remain.Despite the Rebels defeating the third-ranked Bulldogs, 39-34, Jimbo Fisher alleged that Kiffin didn’t believe his former team would advance past Georgia in the second round.“Here’s where he screwed up. He thought they’re going to lose to Georgia, and the portal thing was going to be all over with,” Fisher added.“He said, ‘Oh, I’ll look like a hero.’ Now, he’s got egg on his face because the real Lane came back out. You know what I’m saying? And if those guys were allowed to coach the first game, they should be allowed to coach. Because those kids are doing something that you get one time in your life to ever do. That team and those guys. One time. And as a coach, listen, I’ve left a job. I get that. But if you took them on and said they’re never coming back, that’s fine. You set the rules of the game. You don’t change the rules in the middle of the game.”“As a coach, it’s hurting the kids, and that pisses me off.”No 6. Due to Ole Miss's unexpected triumph over Georgia, the team's semifinal matchup with 10th-seeded Miami on Thursday falls squarely within the crucial transfer portal window. Lane Kiffin has little time to onboard his coaches at LSU and add new players because the college football transfer portal opened on Jan. 2 and closes Jan. 16.Ole Miss offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. and running backs coach Kevin Smith will coach Thursday night despite being LSU-bound after the season, while tight ends coach Joe Cox and receivers coach George McDonald are not expected to be on the sideline, according to ESPN. As Kiffin seeks to rebuild the Tigers, this recruiting window is crucial.Quarterback Demond Williams Jr. signed a $4 million NIL contract with Washington in late December, but he appears to have reneged on it, and most reports imply that the LSU Tigers will be involved. Washington is so angered by the issue that the school will consider legal action against Williams Jr., claiming that the contract was legally binding and that he cannot reenter the portal.Ole Miss is a three-point underdog on Thursday, and Kiffin is unlikely to attend the game after the turmoil last week over whether he would attend the quarterfinal win.Also read: Jimbo Fisher: Who is the record-breaking head coach to get fired by Texas A&M?","Lane Kiffin left Ole Miss late last year to take a position at LSU, bringing several assistant coaches with him.

Due to a difficult injury scenario, Chicago will now play on the second night of a back-to-back, which is a dangerous combination.The Bulls' lack of offensive depth due to the absence or limitations of key playmakers makes it even more difficult to defeat a Heat club that is improving with Herro's return. On the other hand, The Bulls lost to the Detroit Pistons 108-93 on Wednesday, dropping their third straight game. As 8-point away underdogs, Chicago was unable to cover the Under (228.5) hit.Covering five of the previous seven games and defeating Chicago in the last two matchups, they have quietly been strong at the window.

Rashee Rice under NFL investigation as league examines domestic violence claims



The NFL is currently investigating serious domestic violence allegations involving Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice. The claims emerged after Dacoda Jones , who shares two children with Rice, posted on Instagram, accusing her former partner of abuse during their eight-year relationship. Jones detailed disturbing experiences, including alleged abuse while pregnant and being locked out of her home in freezing temperatures.Jones also shared images showing alleged injuries and property damage, drawing immediate attention on social media. While she did not directly name Rice in her post, the claims quickly went viral, prompting responses from both the NFL and the Chiefs organization. Rice’s grandmother publicly defended him in the comments, adding further attention to the situation.The NFL confirmed on Thursday that it is reviewing the matter under its personal conduct policy, emphasizing that it has been in contact with the Chiefs regarding the allegations. The league’s statement highlights the ongoing process, signaling a structured approach to addressing claims of this nature while maintaining due process for the player involved.The Chiefs also acknowledged awareness of the situation, though they have yet to release a detailed statement.Rice’s attorney told sources that Rice has not been charged with any crime, providing minimal comment on the allegations. This leaves the focus primarily on the league’s review and any potential internal measures the team may take in response.Domestic violence claims in professional sports have increasingly drawn scrutiny in recent years, with the NFL facing pressure to act swiftly and transparently. Previous cases have demonstrated that the league’s investigations can affect player availability, reputations, and contractual decisions, making this review significant not only for Rice but for the Chiefs organization as well.The ongoing investigation underscores the NFL’s commitment to addressing off-field conduct seriously. While Rice has not faced legal charges, the league’s internal review could have implications for his playing status and public perception.As this matter develops, both the NFL and the Chiefs are expected to monitor the situation closely, balancing procedural fairness with the need to address sensitive allegations. Updates are likely as the league continues its review, ensuring that all aspects of the claims are examined thoroughly under established policy guidelines.Also Read: Travis Kelce faces controversy again over “Free 4” support amid Rashee Rice's domestic abuse allegations","Rashee Rice under NFL investigation as league examines domestic violence claims.

Isiah Thomas thinks modern NBA is another golden era with LeBron James , Stephen Curry and KD



The Detroit Pistons legend Isiah Thomas surely knows how to put the internet on fire, and that’s what he did with his latest comments. Known for not shying away from a confrontation, Thomas has reignited the most contentious debate in sports: Who’s the greatest?During a January 8, 2026, appearance on the Run It Back show with DeMarcus Cousins and Chandler Parsons, Thomas questioned the logic behind Michael Jordan ’s ""GOAT"" status and why modern NBA is not supporting its players and continuously downplays them in comparison to the last generation. Thomas feels that the current NBA has superior athleticism and record-breaking achievements, and is nurturing the greatest of all time.Isiah Thomas joined the panel of Run It Back on FanDuel TV and dropped some truth bombs. Discussing what the golden era of NBA is, Thomas pointed out that modern NBA has some of the biggest stars, yet their obsession to time and again go back to call the 80s and 90s as the golden era of basketball isn’t fair to today’s players who are putting up numbers and leading charts.He said, “Our era is considered to be the golden era. This is what I don’t understand about your era, right? You guys are playing with arguably the greatest player that ever played, and you do not say this, but y’all treat him like he ain’t nothing.”He continued to add, “Instead of pumping your era up, y’all go back and say our era was the greatest…you know, Michael Jordan was the greatest. Nobody can ever be greater than Michael Jordan.And then you turn around in your era, LeBron James is in there, and he’s holding every single basketball record. I mean every single one of them. You looking at Kevin Durant, you looking at Steph Curry, but then when you say who’s the greatest, y’all talk about the guy who gave y’all some shoes and warmups. ”To Thomas, it is dishonest and ignorant to call someone else the greatest when LeBron James has surpassed legendary benchmarks once thought untouchable, such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s scoring record and Magic Johnson’s assist totals.Also read: “Everything is TBD"": LeBron James' wilding reply after turning 41","Isiah Thomas thinks modern NBA is another golden era with LeBron James, Stephen Curry and KD.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has intensified its standoff with the International Cricket Council (ICC) by sending a second formal communication, reiterating its demand to move Bangladesh’s matches in the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup from India to Sri Lanka, citing security concerns.The tournament is scheduled to begin on February 7, with Bangladesh slated to play four group matches — three in Kolkata and one in Mumbai. However, the team has so far refused to travel to India, escalating uncertainty over its participation just weeks before the global event.According to reports, the latest letter was sent after discussions between the BCB and sports ministry advisor Asif Nazrul, who has taken a firm stance on the issue. “The ICC wanted to know the areas of concern regarding security, and the BCB has cited them in detail,” a source close to the board told PTI, requesting anonymity. The specifics of the concerns, however, have not been made public.The renewed communication comes against the backdrop of the Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman being released from the IPL on instructions from the BCCI, which cited unspecified “developments all around” as the reason.That decision appears to have deepened mistrust and hardened the BCB’s position.The ICC, while yet to make a public statement, has sought clarity from the Dhaka-based board on the exact nature of the apprehensions. Internally, the BCB itself remains divided. One faction is backing Nazrul’s uncompromising approach, while another is pushing for continued dialogue with the ICC and Indian authorities, arguing that enhanced and foolproof security arrangements could address the concerns.Nazrul’s assertive line marks a shift from the BCB’s traditionally cordial relationship with the BCCI. For now, the ICC has given no indication that Bangladesh’s venues will be shifted from Kolkata and Mumbai to Colombo, though the BCB maintains that the global body has shown willingness to assess the security issues raised.","Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has intensified its standoff with the International Cricket Council (ICC) The BCB has sent a second formal communication, reiterating its demand to move Bangladesh’s matches in the upcoming T20 World Cup from India to Sri Lanka.

Poll How do you feel about the financial differences between PSL and IPL? It's concerning It's normal in sports I don't care about finances

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan Super League (PSL) took a decisive step towards expansion on Thursday, inducting two new franchises ahead of the 2026 season — but the price tags attached underlined the stark financial gap between the PSL and the Indian Premier League ( IPL ).A real estate consortium and a US-based aviation and healthcare conglomerate won the bids for the two new teams at a combined price of $12.75 million (approximately INR 114 crore). OZ Developers secured the Sialkot franchise for PKR 1.85 billion ($6.55 million), while the FKS Group from the United States picked Hyderabad after a successful bid of PKR 1.75 billion ($6.2 million).With these additions, the PSL will expand from six to eight teams when the season begins on March 26, marking a new phase in the league's growth strategy. However, the auction figures have sparked discussion across the cricketing world for a different reason — the dramatic contrast with IPL valuations.Each of the new PSL teams was sold for roughly INR 56–59 crore, a figure that is almost identical to the combined IPL salaries of Shreyas Iyer (INR 26.75 crore) and Rishabh Pant (INR 27 crore). In fact, the combined cost of the two new PSL franchises is still lower than the INR 118 crore spent on just the top nine players at the IPL 2026 auction.The contrast becomes even sharper when placed against IPL franchise sales. The two IPL expansion teams added in 2021 were sold for INR 5,625 crore and INR 7,090 crore respectively — nearly 100 to 125 times the price of a new PSL franchise on a like-for-like basis. Even when adjusted for inflation, the IPL's original 2008 franchise fees would today sit in the INR 900–1,500 crore range, still vastly higher than PSL's latest numbers.Meanwhile, former Multan Sultans owner Ali Khan Tareen stayed away from the auction despite being eligible to bid. Explaining his decision on social media, Tareen reiterated that his association with the PSL was rooted in representing South Punjab. “When the Multan team is being sold, we'll be ready,” he wrote.For now, Multan Sultans will be run by the Pakistan Cricket Board this season before being put up for sale after the PSL concludes in April.","Pakistan Super League inducted two new franchises ahead of 2026 season.

India vs New Zealand ODIs preview: Captain Shubman Gill, vice-captain Shreyas Iyer in focus

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli 's brother, Vikas Kohli, has come out strongly in defence of the Indian batting great, firing a sharp salvo at critics who, according to him, rely on Virat's name to remain relevant. Without naming anyone directly, Vikas posted a pointed message on Threads that quickly set social media buzzing and reignited debate around the former India captain's career choices.“SEEMS LIKE LOGON KI DAAL ROTI NAHI CHALTI. BINA VIRAT KOHLI KA NAAM LIYE HUE (It seems like people cannot run their houses without taking Virat Kohli's name),” Vikas wrote, a remark widely interpreted by fans as a response to recent criticism aimed at Virat. While the post did not mention any individual, the timing led many to link it to comments made by former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar.Earlier this week, Manjrekar had expressed disappointment over Virat Kohli's decision to step away from Test cricket, suggesting the batter could have shown greater resolve by attempting to rediscover his best red-ball form instead of ending his Test journey. The remarks triggered strong reactions among fans, with Vikas's post seen as a firm rebuttal to what supporters felt was unnecessary criticism.Away from the off-field chatter, Virat Kohli remains firmly focused on cricket. The 37-year-old is preparing for the upcoming three-match ODI series against New Zealand, beginning Sunday in Vadodara. He arrived in the city on January 7, drawing massive crowds at the airport and prompting heightened security arrangements.Kohli enters the series in imperious ODI form. He was the Player of the Series against South Africa after scoring 302 runs, including back-to-back centuries. His return to domestic cricket in the Vijay Hazare Trophy after nearly 15 years further underlined his rhythm, with scores of 131 against Andhra and 77 versus Gujarat.Now an exclusive ODI player, Kohli has begun net sessions in Vadodara and will look to continue his purple patch against New Zealand.",Vikas Kohli fires a sharp salvo at critics who rely on Virat's name to remain relevant.

Alexandre Texier made history Wednesday night at Bell Centre. The French forward recorded his first career three-point game and reached 100 NHL points as the Montreal Canadiens defeated the Calgary Flames 4-1 in their first home game following a seven-game road trip.Texier opened the scoring in the second period, beating Dustin Wolf high in tight for his milestone 100th career point. The goal came just days after he was named to Team France's Olympic roster for the 2026 Winter Games in Milano Cortina, making the night even more special for the 24-year-old.Quebec Premier François Legault attended the game and celebrated Texier's performance by tweeting ""Vive la France!"" after the victory, acknowledging the significance of the French connection in Montreal.Texier has shown since arriving in Montreal in late November that he possesses the offensive skills and hockey sense to play alongside Nick Suzuki and Cole Caufield on the top line. He added two assists to his goal on Wednesday, helping set up Caufield's 21st goal of the season in the third period to cap the scoring.The performance validated the decision by general manager Kent Hughes to sign Texier after his contract was mutually terminated by the St.Louis Blues. He managed just one point in eight games with St. Louis but has thrived in Montreal with 11 points in 21 games.The Canadiens broke open a scoreless game with three goals in the second period. After Texier opened the scoring, Lane Hutson blasted a one-timer from the high slot to make it 2-0. Oliver Kapanen added his 14th goal of the season just 1:07 later, keeping pace in the rookie scoring race with Beckett Sennecke of Anaheim.Phil Danault made his first home appearance for Montreal since being reacquired from Los Angeles in December, winning 13 of 15 faceoffs and assisting on Hutson's goal.Joel Farabee spoiled Jacob Fowler's shutout bid late in the second period, ending the goaltender's home shutout streak at 116:38. Fowler finished with 28 saves in the victory.Texier's dominant performance showed he deserves to remain on Montreal's top line even when injured forwards Kirby Dach and Alex Newhook return. His 6’1”, 200-pound frame allows Texier to perfectly complement Suzuki and Caufield’s more physical style.Meanwhile, his hockey IQ and speed make him a big threat in front of the net. The Canadiens continue their hot play as they enter a stretch of five games in seven nights before the Olympic break. Next up is a matchup against the Florida Panthers and a potential showdown with Brad Marchand.","Alexandre Texier recorded his first career three-point game and reached 100 NHL points as the Montreal Canadiens defeated the Calgary Flames 4-1.

NEW DELHI: Australia’s emphatic 4–1 Ashes series victory over England has had a significant impact on the ICC World Test Championship (WTC) 2025–27 standings, with the former champions extending their lead at the top while England’s campaign continues to unravel and India’s position gains added context.Following their five-wicket win in the fifth and final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday, Australia surged further ahead with a points percentage (PCT) of 87.50, up from 85.71. The result marked their seventh win of the current WTC cycle, with their only blemish coming in the Boxing Day Test, where England stunned them in a two-day finish.Chasing a modest 160 on the final day, Australia were briefly tested as England triggered a collapse, but Cameron Green (22), along with wicketkeeper Alex Carey (16), calmly guided the hosts home after lunch. The win not only sealed the series but also sent retiring opener Usman Khawaja out on a high in his final Test appearance.England’s defeat further dented their WTC hopes. Ben Stokes’ side slumped to their sixth loss in 10 matches, dragging their PCT down to 31.66. They remain seventh on the table, marginally ahead of Bangladesh and the West Indies, but crucially just below India.For India, the updated standings offer cautious encouragement. Shubman Gill’s side sit sixth with a PCT of 48.15, keeping them within striking distance of the top four as the cycle progresses. With several key home and away series still to come, England’s slide opens up space for India to climb if they can string together consistent results.Behind Australia, inaugural champions New Zealand occupy second place with a PCT of 77.78, followed by South Africa (75.00) and Sri Lanka (66.67), making the race for the WTC final spots increasingly competitive.","Australia extended their lead at the top of the ICC World Test Championship with a five-wicket win in the fifth and final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

Since mid-December, he has been on the floor more often, but the team has continued to manage his workload carefully.With no designation attached to his name yet, his availability could come down to pregame warmups and last-minute evaluations.In 18 games, LaMelo Ball is averaging 19.7 points, 7.9 assists, 5.0 rebounds, and 1.2 steals per game. His scoring has dipped recently to around 15 points per game, but he remains Charlotte’s primary ball-handler and creator.When the Hornets faced Indiana earlier this season on November 19, Ball posted 18 points, nine assists, and seven rebounds. Charlotte lost that game 127-118, with turnovers playing a key role.Indiana arrives in Charlotte missing several key players. Tyrese Haliburton is out with a torn right Achilles tendon. Isaiah Jackson is sidelined due to a concussion, Bennedict Mathurin is out with a right thumb sprain, and Obi Toppin is dealing with a right foot stress fracture. Taelon Peter is listed as doubtful while on G League assignment.With those absences, Pascal Siakam has taken on more responsibility and has been averaging 23.7 points over his recent games.Charlotte is sitting around a 13-24 record and also has to monitor Brandon Miller, who is dealing with a knee contusion. If Miller cannot go, Miles Bridges is expected to see extended minutes. Bridges is averaging 17.1 points and 6.1 rebounds this season.Also read: Indiana Pacers vs Charlotte Hornets injury report (January 8, 2026): Injured and questionable players, where to watch, team stats, and more Rookie Kon Knueppel previously scored 28 points when Charlotte was short-handed.

NHL Injury Update: Columbus Blue Jackets’ Brendan Smith sidelined after knee surgery,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-injury-update-columbus-blue-jackets-brendan-smith-sidelined-after-knee-surgery/articleshow/126420567.cms,"Brendan Smith (Image Via Getty Images)

How will Brendan Smith’s knee injury affect Columbus Blue Jackets’ defense?

Brendan Smith is caught in the middle of a difficult situation with the Columbus Blue Jackets. The injury of the seasoned blueliner further complicates the already hard-pressed team. Defensive reshuffles are taking place as the contending teams in the Eastern Conference are having a tougher time finding their way.The pressure on Smith's case escalated as soon as he got injured and had to be evaluated right away, leading to the first roster changes that eventually included him being put on the injured list. After two weeks, the Blue Jackets seemed ready to reflect on the situation, but they still had to clarify both the injury's extent and how long the defenseman would miss the ice.The Blue Jackets announced that Smith had a knee operation to fix a lesion in his meniscus, which is the same injury he sustained on December 29 during the game against the Ottawa Senators when the Blue Jackets won 4-1. Smith came on the injured reserve list on January 2nd, and the operation was successfully done on January 6th. According to Don Waddell, Blue Jackets' President of Hockey Operations and GM, Smith is predicted to be out for 3–4 months, although the team is confident that he will be back in full shape.At age 36, Smith signed a one-year contract with the Columbus team on November 24, and he has been playing just 15 games this season. With only two assists and 11 penalty minutes in his average ice time of 11:05, he was mainly a depth defenseman who provided stability and experience.A first-round pick of the Detroit Red Wings at the 2007 NHL Draft, Smith has spent 741 NHL games with 6 different teams, scoring 146 points along with considerable playoff experience. His current absence forces the Blue Jackets to put more reliance on young defenders as the team still has a road schedule ahead.The Blue Jackets' chances of losing incredibly experienced players during a difficult period increased with the prediction that Smith would take 3-4 months off. The healing timetable has now dictated the team's defensive strategy for the rest of the season in Columbus.Also Read: Connor McDavid’s Edmonton Home: Inside Hockey’s most talked-about residence","The Columbus Blue Jackets announced that defenseman Brendan Smith had a knee operation to fix a lesion in his meniscus.

Is Florida Panthers captain Aleksander Barkov likely to return this season after knee surgery?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/is-florida-panthers-captain-aleksander-barkov-likely-to-return-this-season-after-knee-surgery/articleshow/126419445.cms,"Aleksander Barkov has resumed skating recently after suffering a torn ACL and MCL in training camp (Image Via Getty Images)

NHL Insider hints at Aleksander Barkov’s return to Florida Panthers this season after ACL injury

Also read:

Aleksander Barkov's chances of returning to the Florida Panthers lineup this season are growing, offering a timely boost to the team's strength as they continue to chase the Stanley Cup. Meanwhile, TSN Hockey Insider Chris Johnston, on Tuesday morning, revealed that Barkov’s chances of being back with Florida this year are “pretty high”.Earlier, the team announced that the captain would remain away from the team for the entire 2025-26 season, after sustaining a non-contact right knee injury on Sept. 25, 2025. Reports suggest that captain Aleksander Barkov has resumed skating recently after suffering a torn ACL and MCL in training camp.Besides, he was also seen taking to the ice before Florida’s loss to the New York Rangers in the Winter Classic on Jan. 2 from Miami’s loanDepot Park. It is important to note that Florida has been playing without Barkov and forward Matthew Tkachuk, who is recovering from surgery for a torn adductor and sports hernia.Still, it's commendable that the team's collective effort has scored a 22-17-3 record and sits just two points away from the playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.The Florida Panthers could get a major boost as their captain, Aleksander Barkov, is reportedly planning to rejoin the team after recovering from a knee injury, followed by a surgery, recently. With this return, the Panthers could begin defense of their back-to-back Stanley Cup titles without captain Aleksander Barkov and alternate captain Matthew Tkachuk.Barkov underwent surgery to repair ACL and MCL injuries suffered on the opening day of camp, sidelining him for seven to nine months, following knee surgery in September. This questioned his ability to suit up for Florida over the course of the 2025-26 season.Meanwhile, NHL Insider Chris Johnston stated, “I think we’re going to see him play for the Panthers before they’ve played their last game this season, but it might still not come until playoff time.”Johnston further said, “He’s started to skate a little bit, but if you’ve seen it, it’s in a tracksuit. He’s still got quite a bit to go, but also, we’re only at the beginning of January.Speaking about his return around April and May, he added, “The absolute best-case scenario is he’s coming back at some point, late April, early May, whatever that is. If you’re the Panthers, you’re rooting for [that], but you’re not counting on them being back.”As per reports, Barkov has recorded 20 goals and 51 assists for 71 points last season, winning both the Selke and King Clancy Trophy. He also added 22 points during the playoffs en route to helping Florida win their second Stanley Cup title in as many years. While Barkov’s return to the ice is surely a positive sign for the Panthers, a return to the lineup is not imminent.","Aleksander Barkov has resumed skating recently after suffering a torn ACL and MCL in training camp.

Japanese reliever Takahiro Norimoto gets MLB offer as longtime Rakuten Eagles closer considers United States move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/japanese-reliever-takahiro-norimoto-gets-mlb-offer-as-longtime-rakuten-eagles-closer-considers-united-states-move/articleshow/126419728.cms,"Japanese reliever Takahiro Norimoto gets MLB offer as longtime Rakuten Eagles closer considers United States move (Image Via Getty)

Takahiro Norimoto weighing MLB offer after long career with Rakuten Eagles

Takahiro Norimoto may soon take the biggest step of his baseball life. On Tuesday night, January 7, 2026, MLB reporter Mark Feinsand of MLB.com reported that Takahiro Norimoto has received a contract offer from a Major League Baseball team. The 35-year-old Japanese pitcher is now deciding if he wants to leave Japan and try MLB.Right now, Takahiro Norimoto is not fully committed. He is also listening to offers from teams in Nippon Professional Baseball. People close to the situation say a decision is expected in the next few days as he weighs his future carefully.Takahiro Norimoto has spent his entire professional career in Japan. He has played 13 seasons with the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles. For most of his career, he worked as a starting pitcher.But over the last two years, he moved into the closer role, pitching the final innings in tight games. In the 2025 NPB season, Takahiro Norimoto posted a 3.02 earned run average across 56 and two-thirds innings.In 2024, he finished with a 3.46 ERA. Over the past two seasons as closer, he converted 48 of 53 save chances. Those numbers helped him stay on the radar of MLB scouts.Mark Feinsand wrote on MLB.com, “Norimoto has received interest from a major league club and is seriously considering whether now is the right time to make the move.” People around the league believe the offer is likely a one-year deal.Takahiro Norimoto does not rely on speed. According to FanGraphs, his fastball usually sits around 92 miles per hour.His best pitch is a splitter that drops late and fools hitters. Scouts say he profiles more as a middle reliever or bullpen depth arm if he comes to MLB.Last season, Takahiro Norimoto struck out 17.2 percent of batters while walking 8.4 percent. He has not crossed the 20 percent strikeout mark in the last four years.Still, teams value his control, experience, and calm presence on the mound. Takahiro Norimoto entered free agency this winter after earning more than nine years of service time in Japan.That gives him full freedom to sign with any NPB team or any foreign club. If he joins MLB, no posting fee would be owed to the Rakuten Eagles.Many insiders believe MLB interest could also help Takahiro Norimoto push for a stronger deal back home. Japan teams are known to pay veteran closers well, especially those with long service records.A source familiar with the talks told Japanese media this week, “Takahiro Norimoto is taking his time. He wants to talk with his family and understand what life in the United States would really mean.”For now, Takahiro Norimoto continues to train in Japan while fielding calls. Whether he chooses a new chapter in MLB or stays in familiar surroundings, his decision is expected soon.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: Ketel Marte Trade Buzz Grows As New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, And Los Angeles Dodgers Watch Arizona Diamondbacks",Takahiro Norimoto has played 13 seasons with the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles.

What unfolded between Lakers vs Spurs ?



In a season filled with highlight-reel moments, Luka Doncic and Jaxson Hayes just delivered the definitive ""drop everything and watch"" play of the year. During Wednesday night’s matchup against the San Antonio Spurs, when the Lakers were 4 points down in comparison to the Spurs' 16, Doncic threw a breathtaking half-court alley-oop that found a soaring Jaxson Hayes for a beautiful reverse slam. This all happened in the first quarter, when most teams are still adjusting and slowly building on their plan, Doncic went “nope.” The dunk brought Lakers bench to their feet and Spurs’ to a realisation that the Lakers are ready to roll.The play developed in the blink of an eye with 4 minutes on the game clock. The Lakers disrupted Spurs offensive possession after Victor Wembanyama failed to score in a jump shot , Doncic secured the ball in a defensive rebound. Most players would have slowed the pace or looked for a standard transition pass, but Luka is not most players. Spotting Hayes sprinting toward the rim, the Slovenian superstar launched a high-arcing pass from nearly 50 feet away.The elevation of the pass was high enough to even defeat Spurs' defensive giant wall, Victor Wembanyam, who tried to intercept it. It hung in the air just long enough for Hayes to time his jump, meeting the ball at its apex with his back to the basket for a reverse dunk.Fans loved it. When the clip was shared on social media the fans went crazy. One fan wrote, “A half-court lob to a reverse slam is just disrespectful levels of casual. Clip of the year contender.” A second fan commented, “man i’m missing that mavs team rn where he had every single piece around him to his liking smh. now we gotta watch “dandre ayton” short pick and roll with no physicality or “jaxon hayes” lob threat with no iq. ”A third fan who just like the second one, didn't sound happy over Luka’s trade to Lakers wrote, “I’ve seen enough Hayes is better than AYTON.”Some fans just rejoiced watching Luka and called it, “luka magic sir.” Another fan emphasizing the ball IQ of Luka and his quick reflexes in turning defense into offense commented, “You just witnessed Luka turning half-court into a layup line.” While another just applauded the Lakers’ talented roster and wrote, “That looked easy for them.”The dunk was a show of pure athleticism, game presence and IQ. From Luka’s pass to Hayes’s grabbing and converting it for 2 points, it was a treat for the Lakers fan. Though the Spurs ultimately took the 107-91 victory with Keldon Johnson’s 27 points. Even in a loss where he posted a 38-point triple-double, with 10 rebounds and 10 assists, Luka’s ability to find Hayes in stride stood out. It wasn't just two points, it was a statement of the growing chemistry between the league’s premier playmaker and its most explosive rim-runner.Also read: “Post up, come on, big fella!”: Snoop Dogg gets candid while calling out modern NBA for abandoning old-school basketball","Luka Doncic and Jaxson Hayes delivered the definitive ""drop everything and watch"" play of the year.

Former Australian batter Damien Martyn is on the road to recovery after a frightening health scare that saw him hospitalised and placed in an induced coma late last year. The 54-year-old, who was admitted to Gold Coast University Hospital on December 27 after falling seriously ill with meningitis, has now been discharged and is continuing his recovery at home.The positive update was shared by former Australia wicketkeeper and long-time teammate Adam Gilchrist , who spoke about Martyn’s condition just before the start of Day 5 of the Sydney Test. Gilchrist confirmed that Martyn had made significant progress since his hospitalisation but cautioned that the journey ahead remains a demanding one.“A quick update on Damien Martyn. He’s home. He’s out of hospital and has made an amazing recovery,” Gilchrist said, as quoted by ESPNcricinfo. “He still has a bit of a journey to go and has a bit to work through but fortunately, he’s been allowed to go home and complete that recovery.”Gilchrist also passed on a message from Martyn to the wider cricketing fraternity. “He just wanted to pass on to the cricketing world - Thank you so much for the love, care and support and interest in his wellbeing.

The Warriors are reluctant to break their core for Anthony Davis



Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green are essential to Warriors' dream for 5 rings



The Golden State Warriors are reportedly keeping the door open for a potential blockbuster trade to acquire Anthony Davis from the Dallas Mavericks, according to Christian Clark and Sam Amick of The Athletic. While the prospect of pairing Stephen Curry with an elite rim protector like Davis is a dream scenario for the Bay Area fans, the financial landscape of such a deal has hit a significant roadblock. If Warriors’ front office wishes to see AD donning their jersey, they have to let go of one of their stars to make space both in the team and the salary pool. But despite the interest, they are currently unwilling to part with veteran leader Draymond Green or newly acquired star Jimmy Butler to facilitate this trade move.Anthony Davis is currently under a veteran extension contract worth $173 million, and will earn a staggering $54 million this season. The Warriors will have to top this to land Davis. Therefore, even if they can adjust AD on the roster, the money remains a significant issue in this scenario. Landing a player of Davis's caliber requires more than just draft picks; it requires a massive salary match.The Mavericks are reportedly looking to build their roster around their 2025 #1 draft pick, Cooper Flagg, who continues to show promising performances.According to ESPN’s Tim MacMahon, “AD's preference would be to stay in Dallas and to get that extension this summer. The Mavericks are trying to generate a good trade market for Anthony Davis. That is difficult because of the durability issues, and I think more so, the dollars. "" Signing Davis comes with risks that the Mavs front office would avoid if they could.The Warriors are already navigating a tight cap sheet. They are paying more than $80 million in tax this season, so without moving a heavy hitter like Green ($25.8 million) or Butler ($54 million), the path to Davis’ expected $54 million is nearly impossible.Another arising obstacle is also Golden State’s commitment to its current core. Jimmy Butler joined the team in a high-profile move from Miami, and his grit and two-way play are essential to keep Warriors’ current championship window. Similarly, the team also remains fiercely protective of their defensive center, Draymond Green. Despite his polarizing nature, the organization believes his chemistry with Stephen Curry is irreplaceable. Without including these names, the Warriors would likely have to involve a third team or package nearly every young asset on the roster, including Jonathan Kuminga ($22.5 million), just to start the conversation. For now, the ""AD to the Bay"" rumors remain a tantalizing but financially difficult fantasy.Also read: “Luka Magic, sir!”: Fans react to Luka Doncic’s high alley-hoop to Jaxson Hayes in Lakers vs Spurs","The Golden State Warriors are reportedly keeping the door open for a potential blockbuster trade to acquire Anthony Davis from the Dallas Mavericks.

Ruben Amaro Jr. says “Moneyball” ignored star players and real baseball balance

Star Power: Don Mattingly, J.T. Realmuto and Bo Bichette

Ruben Amaro Jr. has strong feelings about the famous baseball movie Moneyball. The former Philadelphia Phillies general manager spoke this week about why he believes the film changed the sport in the wrong way. He said the movie made many people believe analytics were the only thing that mattered, while real on-field talent was pushed into the background.Ruben Amaro Jr. shared his views on Wednesday’s episode of the “Phillies Show,” hosted by Todd Zolecki and Jim Salisbury. The film, released in 2011 and starring Brad Pitt , told the story of the 2002 Oakland Athletics and their data-driven approach under executive Billy Beane. While the movie received major praise and award nominations, Amaro believes it failed to tell the full story.“Ruined the game for like 20 years,” Ruben Amaro Jr. said. “Great, entertaining movie. But they forgot about the three Cy Young Award winners in the rotation.”He explained that the 2002 Oakland Athletics were not just a team built on numbers. They were loaded with real stars.The pitching staff included Tim Hudson, Barry Zito, and Mark Mulder. Barry Zito won the American League Cy Young Award in 2002. Tim Hudson and Mark Mulder both finished as Cy Young runners-up in nearby seasons.Ruben Amaro Jr. also said the movie ignored how strong the team’s hitters were. Miguel Tejada, the team’s shortstop, hit 34 home runs and won the American League MVP award that season.Eric Chavez also hit 34 home runs and finished near the top of MVP voting. “Other than that, it was a great movie,” Amaro said with a laugh.He admitted the Athletics did succeed with a smaller payroll. But he believes the film made it seem like data alone won games, which he strongly disagrees with.Ruben Amaro Jr. has shared similar thoughts before. On a January 2025 episode of the same show, he said the movie pushed baseball too far toward numbers and away from feel.“That’s what disappointed me the most,” he said. “In many ways, I think it took baseball backwards. The analytics part took over so much that now they’re making rules to try to get the game back.”More than a decade after its release, Ruben Amaro Jr. believes Moneyball still shapes how fans and front offices look at baseball today.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: Ketel Marte Trade Buzz Grows As New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, And Los Angeles Dodgers Watch Arizona Diamondbacks","Former Philadelphia Phillies GM Ruben Amaro Jr. has strong feelings about the famous baseball movie Moneyball.
