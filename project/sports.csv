“After marrying Gisele…”: Tom Brady blamed Gisele Bündchen’s strict diet and politics for ruining his friendship with Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/after-marrying-gisele-tom-brady-blamed-gisele-bndchens-strict-diet-and-politics-for-ruining-his-friendship-with-donald-trump/articleshow/123520062.cms,"Donald Trump, Tom Brady & Gisele Bündchen (Getty Images)

How Tom Brady’s health-conscious diet clashed with Donald Trump’s fast food routine

Politics drove the final wedge in their relationship



In the early 2000s, Tom Brady and President Donald Trump were often linked as unlikely friends. The young NFL star and the New York real estate mogul exchanged compliments publicly, with Donald Trump even envisioning Brady as a possible match for his daughter Ivanka. But as years passed, their bond reportedly began to unravel—first over lifestyle differences, and later over politics.According to Jonathan Martin’s political book This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden, and the Battle for America’s Future, Donald Trump privately remarked that Brady “had not been the same after marrying Gisele Bündchen, who insisted on cooking him a painstakingly health-conscious diet.” By the mid-2000s, Brady had adopted his famous TB12 Method, cutting out sugar, caffeine, dairy, refined carbs, and even certain vegetables like tomatoes and eggplant to minimize inflammation.The results were undeniable: Brady extended his career to 22 NFL seasons, captured seven Super Bowl rings, and played competitively into his mid-40s. Still, the discipline behind his plant-based, high-performance diet stood in stark contrast to Trump’s highly publicized fast food habits. The former president was known to stock Air Force One with McDonald’s, KFC, and pizza, reportedly consuming meals like “two Big Macs, two Filet-O-Fish, and a chocolate shake” for dinner.Dietary differences may have sparked distance, but politics widened the gap. Donald Trump once openly expressed a desire for Brady to marry Ivanka, but by 2015 their friendship had soured. When Donald Trump ran for president and asked Brady to speak at the Republican National Convention, the quarterback declined. “It was uncomfortable for me because you can’t undo things… political support is a lot different than the support of a friend,” Brady told Howard Stern in 2020.Also Read: “Oh get to f*** Gisele”: Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bündchen’s mental health advice ignites controversy online What began as a friendship rooted in admiration ended in quiet separation, shaped by choices in food, lifestyle, and politics.","In the early 2000s, Tom Brady and President Donald Trump were often linked as unlikely friends.

“He kept hitting”: Wayne Gretzky admits his last NHL game was “awful” as his dad kept pushing him to play one more year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/he-kept-hitting-wayne-gretzky-admits-his-last-nhl-game-was-awful-as-his-dad-kept-pushing-him-to-play-one-more-year/articleshow/123502251.cms,"Wayne Gretzky (Getty Images)

The final drive with Walter Gretzky that meant more than the farewell ovation

Lessons from Walter Gretzky that shaped a hockey icon

Wayne Gretzky’s last NHL appearance on April 18, 1999, at Madison Square Garden is remembered as a celebration of the “Great One’s” extraordinary career. Yet, for Gretzky, the moment wasn’t only about the sold-out crowd, the ovations, or the history—it was about a quiet car ride with his father, Walter Gretzky.On the 25th anniversary of his retirement, Wayne Gretzky reflected on why he asked Walter to drive him to Madison Square Garden that night. “For my final game, I decided that since my dad drove me to the first game I ever went to, it would be great to drive my dad to my last game,” he told NHL.com.That ride, however, was far from ordinary. Gretzky admitted, “The ride was good, but it was kind of awful in the same sense because every three minutes, he kept hitting my leg and telling me that I could play one more year. I said, ‘No, dad, I’m done.’”While the NHL and fans worldwide treated the day as a fitting farewell to the greatest player in hockey history, Gretzky cherished that personal moment most. To him, it was the perfect full-circle memory, blending his first steps in hockey with the end of his iconic journey.Wayne Gretzky's father, Walter Gretzky was more than just a supportive parent—he was the guiding force behind Wayne’s rise.When officials tried to block young Wayne from moving to Toronto in 1974, Walter stood firm, saying, “No, they can't tell me where to send my own boy… If he will be happy elsewhere, we decide between the family.”Also Read: What is the Wayne Gretzky Rule and how it changed the modern NHL forever Walter’s philosophy of family first left a lifelong mark on Wayne, who carried those values into his career and personal life. Though Walter passed away in 2021, his wisdom continues to influence Gretzky, reminding fans that behind the hockey legend was always a devoted son.After his retirement in 1999, Wayne Gretzky was immediately inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, making him the most recent player to have the waiting period waived. The NHL retired his jersey number 99 league-wide. Gretzky was one of six players voted to the International Ice Hockey Federation's (IIHF) Centennial All-Star Team.Gretzky's career achievements include a record nine Hart Trophies as the most valuable player in the NHL. Between 1981 and 1994, he won the Art Ross Trophy, presented to the NHL's season points leader, 10 times.","Wayne Gretzky's last NHL appearance on April 18, 1999, at Madison Square Garden is remembered as a celebration of the “Great One’s” extraordinary career.

Sanders brothers face different NFL fates



Sanders family resilience shines brighter than football

Deion Sanders stood in a place only a father and a football legend could—watching his sons fight for their NFL dreams as teams trimmed rosters to 53. Both Shedeur and Shilo Sanders carried the Sanders name onto the field with passion, grit, and promise. The results, however, couldn’t have been more different, and yet Deion’s words showed where his true pride lies.Shedeur Sanders, drafted in the fifth round, found a home with the Cleveland Browns. His preseason started with sparks—13-of-24, 138 yards, and two touchdowns—but ended on a shaky note. Despite that, his work was enough to earn a place on the Browns’ roster. Shilo Sanders, on the other hand, went undrafted but was picked up by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. His path turned rough after being ejected for throwing a punch in the final preseason game, leading to an early cut.Through it all, their father stayed grounded. Deion Sanders, fresh off a battle with bladder cancer, kept perspective: “All of the Sanders’ are going to be straight, with or without football.” Those words carried a weight beyond sports—a reminder that the Sanders legacy isn’t defined by wins, losses, or roster spots.Even as Shedeur celebrates making the team, his role is set for development. With head coach Kevin Stefanski naming Dillon Gabriel the backup to Joe Flacco, Shedeur will start as the Browns’ third-string quarterback. Stefanski explained, “It’s such an all-encompassing evaluation… we also saw a lot of them out here in practice and how they are at their craft.” For Shedeur, growth remains the priority.For the Sanders family, setbacks are not dead ends. Shilo may have been cut, but opportunities remain in a league where injuries and roster shifts are constant. Shedeur, only 23, has shown flashes that justify Cleveland’s belief in him.Deion himself now turns his attention back to Colorado, preparing his Buffaloes for their opener against Georgia Tech. Yet whether it’s Folsom Field or an NFL stadium, the message remains the same: family strength outweighs football outcomes.The Browns may have secured their third-string quarterback, but the Sanders family has already proven they’re built for the long game—on and off the field.Also Read: “We got this one right!”: Tom Brady proves fatherhood is his greatest win with heartfelt letter to son Jack","Shedeur Sanders, drafted in the fifth round, found a home with the Cleveland Browns.

Michael Jordan wins $8.9 million lawsuit against Dominick’s in 2015

Michael Jordan donates the proceeds and supports Chicago children

Even after retiring from the NBA, Michael Jordan has remained a strong and determined figure. Off the court, he is just as careful about his rights as he was about his game. One story from 2015 shows how seriously he protects his personal identity. Jordan’s actions sent a clear message about defending personal rights and giving back to the community at the same time.The case began in Chicago, Illinois, where Michael Jordan, the Hall of Famer and six-time NBA champion, noticed his name was used without permission. The Chicago-based supermarket chain Dominick’s, a subsidiary of Safeway that later closed in 2013, ran an advertisement in 2011 featuring Jordan’s name to promote a meat sale in a Sports Illustrated special issue. Jordan’s legal team said the chain had no right to use his name.The supermarket first offered a settlement of about $126,900, but Michael Jordan’s lawyers argued that the sum should match the real advertising value of his name. After the court reviewed the case, Jordan won $8.9 million. ESPN reported his comments after the verdict, saying,“No one, whether or not they’re a public figure, should have to worry about their identity being used without their permission.”Jordan added, “I hope this case sends a clear message…that I will continue to be vigilant about protecting my name and identity.”Michael Jordan made it clear that the lawsuit was not about money. Instead, it was about integrity, honesty, and defending his personal rights. He pledged to donate the full $8.9 million to 23 charities in Chicago that support children’s health, education, and well-being. In a news release shared with ABA Journal, Jordan said, “Chicago has given me so much, and I want to give back to its kids, the city’s future.”Jordan, now 62, is not only a legendary basketball player but also a cultural icon who uses his platform to make a difference. The Dominick’s case shows how he defends his rights and uses victories to help others.His careful attention to personal identity also comes amid other legal challenges, such as his 2015 lawsuit in China against Qiaodan Sports, which uses his name and number 23 without permission. This story originally appeared on ESPN and ABA Journal and highlights Michael Jordan’s commitment to personal rights, community support, and integrity both on and off the courtWhile not revealing his true name, Michael Jordan recently raised additional funds by offering a donation of $10 million and launching two community health centers in Wilmington, North Carolina in millions for these initiatives, emphasizing his great and continuous dedication to helping underprivileged areas.","Michael Jordan won $8.9 million lawsuit against Dominick's in 2015.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce just took their love story to the next level with a glamorous engagement announcement that has fans buzzing. The couple revealed the news on August 26 in a playful joint Instagram post, writing: “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married. ” Swift, known for her effortless style, stunned in a chic Ralph Lauren halter dress and luxury accessories, but it was her sparkling engagement ring that stole the spotlight. Naturally, the big question now is: how much did it cost, and does it rank among the most expensive celebrity engagement rings ever? Taylor Swift ’s engagement ring, valued between $550,000 and over $1 million, does not make it to the top 10 list of the world’s most expensive celebrity engagement rings, where the prices soar much higher. For example, Mariah Carey’s dazzling 35-carat ring is valued at around $10 million, while Elizabeth Taylor’s iconic 33.19-carat piece was sold for $8.8 million. Below are some of the other most extravagant rings owned by celebrities.Travis Kelce made his fairytale moment unforgettable when he dropped to one knee, pulled out a ring, and said, “Marry me.” Taylor Swift’s “yes” was followed by an Instagram reveal of the masterpiece, designed in collaboration with Kindred Lubeck and Artifex Fine Jewelry.Forbes valued the piece at around $550,000. The Old Mine Brilliant Cut diamond—a rectangular shape with vintage charm—makes this ring a modern yet timeless treasure. While the ring is very much beautiful and valuable, it is way less expensive than the rings on the top 10 lists.Scarlett Johansson kept her romance with Colin Jost low-key, but her 2019 engagement ring was impossible to ignore. Featuring an old-cut light-brown diamond with stunning clarity, the piece is worth $450,000. Representatives from Rare Carat described it as a rare gem, fitting for Hollywood royalty.Cristiano Ronaldo didn’t hold back when proposing to Georgina Rodriguez. Her oval-shaped stunner, weighing in at an estimated 37 carats, is valued at a jaw-dropping $5 million. Rodriguez wrote, “Yes I do. In this and in all my lives,” making the breathtaking piece even more unforgettable.Kate Middleton’s 12-carat sapphire ring, once worn by Princess Diana, carries immeasurable sentimental value. Surrounded by diamonds and worth around $500,000, it became instantly iconic when paired with her navy dress during their 2010 engagement announcement.Prince Harry’s thoughtful design for Meghan Markle featured a 3-carat cushion-cut diamond from Botswana, flanked by stones from Diana’s collection. Estimated at $350,000, the ring was more about legacy than luxury.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos chose an estimated 30-carat pink diamond for Lauren Sánchez, a piece Vogue and jewelry experts valued between $3 million to $5 million—a true billionaire’s choice.Gwen Stefani’s radiant-cut 8-carat diamond, flanked by trapezoid sides, gave off major Art Deco vibes. Worth about $500,000, it matched the boldness of her personality and their love story.Though their romance ended, Lady Gaga’s heart-shaped 6-carat Lorraine Schwartz creation still shines in memory. Valued at $500,000, it carried the personal engraving “T ♡ S.”The NFL star designed a three-stone ring with Ring Concierge, estimated at $600,000. Culpo’s timeless oval cut with epaulette side stones reflected her style and their modern fairytale romance.George Clooney’s proposal to Amal featured a 7-carat emerald-cut diamond with side baguettes, valued around $750,000. Elegant and classic, it perfectly matched Amal’s sophistication.Rapper Gucci Mane turned heads with a 25-carat diamond during his 2016 proposal.

Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is officially off the market. On August 27, 2025, Travis Kelce popped the question to Taylor Swift with a dazzling engagement ring estimated to be worth nearly $1 million, marking one of the biggest celebrity proposal stories of the year. But while the NFL star and global pop icon are now preparing for their future together, Travis Kelce’s road to love wasn’t always this glamorous. Before Taylor Swift, he was already quite popular among the ladies, from reality TV drama to long-term romances. Let’s rewind through his dating timeline before he found “the one.”Travis Kelce’s love life first hit the spotlight in 2016 when he starred in the E! reality dating show. Out of 50 contestants, he chose Maya Benberry as the winner. Their romance, however, didn’t last long just a few months after the cameras stopped rolling, the couple went their separate ways.The split wasn’t exactly quiet either. Maya Benberry later hinted in interviews that Travis Kelce might not have been faithful, sparking headlines and early chatter about his bachelor lifestyle. Still, the show gave Travis Kelce national recognition beyond the NFL and set the stage for his future fame.In 2017, Travis Kelce began dating sports broadcaster and influencer Kayla Nicole. This turned out to be his most serious relationship before Taylor Swift, lasting nearly five years. The couple made countless red carpet appearances, social media posts, and even breakups and reconciliations that kept fans guessing.Rumors swirled that money disputes and cheating accusations played a role in their rocky timeline, though both Travis Kelce and Kayla Nicole kept the details vague. By 2022, the relationship had ended for good, leaving fans speculating about why things didn’t work out.Entertainment reporter Zuri Hall was linked to Travis Kelce after sightings in his VIP suite and some public proximity. The connection was never formally confirmed by either side.The pairing quietly fizzled, Travis Kelce later described himself as single around that period. There were no public allegations or drama, just an unverified, short-lived link that didn’t turn into a relationship.Travis Kelce’s love life took a fairytale turn in 2023 when he publicly admitted he tried to give Taylor Swift his number on a friendship bracelet during one of herconcerts. That bold move eventually led to Taylor Swift attending a Kansas City Chiefs game, instantly sending the internet into meltdown.From there, the two quickly became the most-watched couple in the world. Their every outing from NFL suites with Swift’s celebrity squad to Kelce flying overseas for Taylor’s concerts became viral moments. Despite massive media attention, the couple stayed strong through playoff chaos, the Super Bowl spotlight, and nonstop public speculation.And now, in 2025, Travis Kelce has taken the ultimate step by proposing with a nearly million-dollar diamond ring, officially locking in his future with the global superstar.Looking back, Travis Kelce’s dating history feels like a journey that led him right here. From a reality show experiment to a long-term love, and now to a fairytale engagement with Taylor Swift, his story has played out in the public eye every step of the way.But today, all the drama and speculation finally took a back seat.

Maple Leafs Core Looks Different After Marner’s Exit

How the Maple Leafs Adjust Could Define Their Season

The Toronto Maple Leafs enter training camp under immense pressure to prove their revamped roster is capable of delivering results. With a turbulent offseason behind them—one that saw Mitch Marner leave for Vegas and Brendan Shanahan step away from the front office—the team now faces the challenge of redefining its identity. For a franchise long measured by postseason success, how quickly the new-look Leafs gel could determine whether this season restores faith or fuels further doubt.Losing Mitch Marner was never going to be easy. Widely regarded as one of the league’s premier playmakers and a strong two-way winger, his departure has left a gap that Toronto didn’t immediately address through a blockbuster signing. Instead, the Maple Leafs seem content to enter the season with internal solutions. That leaves young talents like Matthew Knies tasked with taking on more defensive responsibility, while the right side of the forward group remains a glaring question mark.One player drawing attention is Easton Cowan, though expectations suggest he will spend more time developing with the Marlies before stepping into a top-six NHL role. This reality places further pressure on Auston Matthews and William Nylander to elevate their chemistry, something that hasn’t clicked as seamlessly as the Matthews–Marner partnership once did.Meanwhile, additions like Nic Roy and Dakota Joshua could provide lineup flexibility, giving head coach Craig Berube room to experiment as the team searches for balance.The biggest storyline heading into the year revolves around how the Maple Leafs adapt to life without Marner. Auston Matthews, fresh off battling a shoulder injury last season, must prove he can remain dominant without his longtime linemate feeding him passes. If Nylander doesn’t seamlessly slot into that role, recently acquired Matias Maccelli could be called upon to act as a setup man, despite a dip in production last year.There’s also the intriguing possibility of Matthews evolving his game. By adopting more of a playmaking role—much like Steven Stamkos did in Tampa Bay after injury—he could help maximize Knies and Nylander’s offensive upside. Such an adjustment wouldn’t just patch the loss of Marner; it could also make Toronto more unpredictable offensively.Ultimately, the question is whether the Maple Leafs can quickly prove that their retooled roster remains competitive at the highest level. If they adapt with resilience, the early months of the season might spark confidence that this group, despite dramatic changes, is still built to chase a championship.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Mason McTavish’s contract talks with Ducks take twist after Marco Rossi’s surprising extension",The Toronto Maple Leafs enter training camp under immense pressure to prove their revamped roster is capable of delivering results.

Why Auston Matthews is under growing scrutiny



Is Auston Matthews being disrespected in the media?

Can Craig Berube unlock the best of Auston Matthews?



The Toronto Maple Leafs enter the 2025–26 season with more questions than answers, and at the heart of the storm stands Auston Matthews. After an injury-plagued campaign that saw his numbers dip to 33 goals, the Leafs captain faces louder criticism than ever. His place among the league’s elite has been challenged, and his response this season may determine not only his legacy but also Toronto’s pursuit of an elusive Stanley Cup.Auston Matthews’ slide to seventh on the NHL Network’s ranking of top centers ignited heated debate. Former players and analysts alike questioned whether his production and leadership still measure up against proven playoff performers. Toronto’s own media hasn’t spared him either. On TSN’s OverDrive, Dave Feschuk questioned his postseason impact, noting: “Sometimes he gives you the idea he isn’t concerned or he’ll do his thing. But his thing being 33 goals, and only four goals in 18 playoff games; that’s why he is 7th. ”The comparison with playoff-tested giants like Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl only sharpens the spotlight. Matthews’ critics point to his lack of signature postseason moments, where Toronto has repeatedly faltered in elimination games.For a franchise haunted by decades without a championship, patience is wearing thin.Inside the locker room, however, Matthews is still seen as a leader whose calm presence sets the standard. His teammates respect the way he leads by example rather than theatrics. New head coach Craig Berube is banking on that composure while also challenging Matthews to evolve into a more complete, two-way player. With a fully healthy season, Berube’s system could be the key to reshaping the narrative around his captain.The Maple Leafs’ season opener is fast approaching, and the stakes couldn’t be higher. For Matthews, silencing the doubts won’t just come from racking up goals in the regular season—it will hinge on delivering when it matters most.

Elliotte Friedman suggests beating Florida would have rewritten Mitch Marner’s future in Toronto

NHL Update From Europe | 32 Thoughts

William Nylander ’s comments show Mitch Marner’s heart was still in Toronto

The Toronto Maple Leafs’ breakup with Mitch Marner has been one of the most polarizing NHL storylines of the summer. After years of speculation about his long-term fit, the star winger was dealt to the Vegas Golden Knights in a blockbuster move. But according to insider Elliotte Friedman, Marner’s exit wasn’t inevitable — it might have been avoided entirely if the Leafs had managed to edge out the Florida Panthers in the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs.On his 32 Thoughts Podcast, Elliotte Friedman floated an intriguing counterfactual: “There are other players who feel that when Marner didn’t sign last summer that the writing was on the wall. My position is this: If they beat Florida in the second round – which they should have done – I don’t see how Mitch Marner isn’t in Toronto.”The idea highlights just how thin the margins are in playoff hockey. A Game 7 win against the Panthers wouldn’t just have sent Toronto deeper into the postseason, it might also have altered the front office’s perspective on keeping their core intact. Friedman even doubled down, saying, “I could be totally wrong… but I just don’t see a way if they beat Florida that Mitch Marner doesn’t find a way to re-sign in Toronto.”Adding fuel to Friedman’s theory are William Nylander’s recent remarks. He revealed, “I don’t think he was ever thinking of leaving ahead of time… his play was focused on helping us. Then I asked him after the season, and he wasn’t sure.”Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Rangers risk losing their Stanley Cup window as key stars face uncertain future Together, the remarks suggest Toronto’s playoff collapse didn’t just end a season — it accelerated a breakup.

What This Means for the Golden State Warriors

Theare exploring potential reinforcements this offseason, and one name on their radar is. As the franchise navigates a complicated summer, Beasley’s shooting ability could provide the offensive boost they are seeking.The Golden State Warriors ’ offseason has been anything but smooth. The front office is still working through contract decisions surrounding restricted free agent Jonathan Kuminga, a process that has slowed down their pursuit of other targets.With Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, and newly added Jimmy Butler leading the charge, Golden State is looking to squeeze out another championship run before time catches up with its core stars. To do so, the team knows it must strengthen its roster through smart signings.According to NBA insider Keith Smith, “the Warriors could potentially be involved in the running for Beasley, but their situation with Kuminga is currently holding them back.”Beasley, who became a free agent after a strong stint in Detroit, is known for his outside shooting and scoring punch. Last season with the Pistons, he played in all 82 games and started 18, averaging an impressive 16.3 points per game.He shot 41.6 percent from beyond the arc, reaffirming his reputation as a reliable floor-spacer. Malik Beasley has carved out a reputation as one of the league’s dependable shooters. His best statistical stretch came in the 2019-20 season, following his trade to the Minnesota Timberwolves, when he averaged 20.7 points across 14 starts.Before his professional career, Beasley played one season of college basketball with the Florida State Seminoles. He entered the NBA as the 19th overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft.If the Golden State Warriors can resolve their situation with Kuminga, pursuing Malik Beasley could be a logical step to strengthen their bench and add much-needed perimeter scoring. At 28 years old, Beasley’s combination of shooting and experience makes him an attractive fit for a team built around stars who thrive with floor-spacing.Also read: NBA Trade News: Golden State Warriors Reject Sign-and-Trade Offers for $48,658,536 Million Star Duo to Improve Titular Odds Golden State’s future success depends on maximizing its current championship window.

Why Timing and Championship Aspirations Play an Important Role

continues to be one of the NBA’s most intriguing trade possibilities, especially with persistent links to the. Despite discussions spanning over 18 months, a deal has not materialized due to a tangled mix of salary cap rules, the Los Angeles Lakers’ reluctance, and LeBron’s own no-trade clause.The Golden State Warriors have made repeated attempts to explore a trade for LeBron James, envisioning a historic duo alongside Stephen Curry. Reports indicate that team owner Joe Lacob even contacted former Lakers ownership to push the idea. Golden State’s interest underscores their desire to maximize Curry’s championship window with another generational superstar.The Los Angeles Lakers have been firm in shutting down trade talks involving LeBron James . While the Warriors have floated scenarios involving Jimmy Butler, Jonathan Kuminga, or multi-player packages, the Lakers have shown no willingness to part ways with their star. For Los Angeles, moving James without a return that significantly bolsters their roster would be a nonstarter.Beyond the Lakers’ stance, James himself wields rare control over his future thanks to his no-trade clause. This provision allows him to veto any deal, making his consent essential. Although speculation has swirled - fueled by comments from agent Rich Paul - LeBron has not formally requested a trade. His silence suggests he is weighing options, but for now, he remains committed to the Los Angeles Lakers.Even if all parties agreed, the financial side presents enormous challenges. LeBron’s contract requires near-exact salary matching under NBA trade rules. For Golden State, that means giving up a high-salary player like Jimmy Butler or combining multiple pieces such as Draymond Green, Moses Moody, and Buddy Hield. Such a move risks hard-cap restrictions and reduces roster flexibility - something the Warriors are cautious about, particularly with Kuminga’s restricted free agency looming.LeBron, who turns 41 later this year, remains motivated to compete for titles. The Warriors are similarly focused on short-term contention, but they are hesitant to jeopardize their future for a risky trade. The Los Angeles Lakers, meanwhile, are not eager to help a Western Conference rival strengthen its championship odds. This clash of ambitions further reduces the likelihood of an in-season deal.The more realistic window for movement could come in the summer, when James will enter free agency. A sign-and-trade scenario may emerge if the Los Angeles Lakers pivot toward rebuilding. Until then, trade chatter will persist, driven by the Warriors’ continued interest and LeBron’s carefully guarded stance.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Potentially Eyeing Former $42 Million Detroit Sharpshooter in Free Agency to Bolster Roster In short, while the idea of Curry and LeBron sharing the court fuels fan excitement, the realities of contracts, finances, and player control make the trade nearly impossible in the present.

Jared McCann’s value to the Seattle Kraken

Brandt Clarke’s future with the Los Angeles Kings

Brandt Clarke scores third hat-trick of the season

Ever since the rumor rounds returned with a new twist, the Seattle Kraken's Jared McCann and the Los Angeles Kings' Brandt Clarke have been the two most outstanding individuals. Attention is being drawn to both players for very different reasons. McCann, the most consistent and reliable scorer for the Kraken, is linked to teams needing additional offensive strength, while Clarke is an option on the trade list, though the Kings seem hesitant to make that move.Jared McCann has been the focal point of the offense for the Seattle Kraken. He has had 3 consecutive seasons of over 60 points to his name, with a 40-goal, 70-point season in 2022-2023. Although there have been a few rumors about the Montreal Canadiens and New Jersey Devils being interested in him, McCann’s departure from Seattle does not seem to be in the cards.In addition to the above, McCann’s contract makes him even more attractive — he is under contract until 2026-27 for $5 million per year and comes with a 10-team no-trade clause. If the Kraken do not struggle this season, it is unlikely he can be taken from them without giving up a lot in return.The Los Angeles Kings are on the other side of these developments and are now working on reshaping their blue line after summer departures and veteran additions.Amid this reorganization, young defenseman Brandt Clarke also came into the rumor spotlight. At 22 years of age, Clarke showed promising growth last season with 33 points in 78 games.While rumors circled that the Kings wanted to move him, it now looks like new general manager Ken Holland wants to gauge Clarke’s performance before taking action. Trading Clarke now would be a gamble, given his measures and entry-level contract, and would become even more so if he blossoms into a franchise defenseman.Also Read: Evander Kane shares heartfelt birthday tribute to finance Mara Teigen Jared McCann talks fade away yet again as the off-season ends.

"When Steve Jobs, who hated getting photographed, called a photo ‘best picture ever taken of me’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-steve-jobs-who-hated-getting-photographed-called-a-photo-best-picture-ever-taken-of-me/articleshow/123500053.cms,"A portrait of conviction



Apple founder Steve Jobs lived by the rule that God is in details



In a proof of power of a single image and the story behind the iconic portrait of Apple co-founder Setev Jobs highlights that how a competent photographer won over the famously camera-shy Jobs. In the year 2006, a Scottish photographer Albert Watson was given the task of capturing a portrait of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs for a magazine. Jobs was known for his camera-shy personality and he also disliked photo sessions. However, the portrait captured by Watson later became iconic and Jobs himself described it as ‘maybe the best picture ever taken of me.’ As reported by Bezinga, commissioned for a magazine feature, was scheduled for 9 a.m. sharp. Jobs arrived at 8:59 a.m., punctual and businesslike. Watson was warned in advance that ‘Jobs hated photographers’. When Watson met Jobs he said, ‘I believe I have you for an hour, but I think I can get this done in half an hour.” Jobs, visibly relieved, replied, “Oh, my god, that would be great. I’ve got so much to do today.”In order to capture the perfect photograph, Watson approached the shoot with minimalist precision. He used a white background, clean lighting and selected passport-style composition. Watson also instructed Jobs to lean a bit forward, imagining himself to be sitting across a table with someone who disagrees with him, but knowing that he was right. Jobs responded with characteristic wit: “Easy for me, I do that every day.”The photo session lasted for about 20 minutes and after seeing the Polaroid, Jobs reportedly said “That’s maybe the best picture ever taken of me.”Years after capturing the perfect portrait of Steve Jobs, Watson received a call from California requesting the photo again. On the same evening he got to know that Jobs has passed away on October 5, 2011 after this battle with pancreatic cancer. Apple then used the same portrait to pay tribute on its homepage. Since then the portrait has become a visual symbol of Jobs’ legacy.Apple founder Steve Jobs believed and lived by a simple rule which clearly defines his successful career, “God is in the details."" As per biographer Walter Isaacon, Jobs spent ‘hours after hours’ obsessing over the smallest of design elements, driven by a belief that ‘God is in the details’. It is believed that this philosophy of Jobs has shaped Apple’s DNA and it still continues to be the culture at the company.",Photographer Albert Watson was given the task of capturing a portrait of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs for a magazine.

Poll Do you think the UAE can upset India in their opening match of the Asia Cup? Yes, they have a good chance No, India is too strong Maybe, depending on the pitch Not sure, it's T20 cricket

(Sony Sports Network is the official broadcaster of the Asia Cup which starts on Sept 9. Watch India vs UAE on 10th September from 7:30pm.)

In T20s, minnows always have a chance. A chance to punch above their weight, a chance to give the favourites a run for their money and a chance to even topple them.Taking inspiration from the past examples, and their recent series win over Bangladesh, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are hoping to upset one of the giants when the Asia Cup kicks off on Sept 9. The hosts UAE are placed in Group A with India, Pakistan and Oman and play the Men in Blue in their opening encounter on Sept 10 in Dubai.When asked about the possibility of upsetting the tournament favourites, UAE coach Lalchand Rajputwas optimistic. “The shortest format gives smaller teams more opportunities to create an upset. It gives them a license to express and play fearless cricket. If you do that, I think anything can happen. It needs just one batter, or a bowler, to take the game away from you,” Rajput said.Besides doing well in the tournament, the former India and Mumbai opener is looking at the larger picture — his goal is to improve UAE cricket.“Smaller teams don’t get many opportunities to play against the big teams. So, for UAE players this is a big opportunity. It also gives our players a chance to showcase their talent. And once you do that, you get more confidence and your game improves.If our players do well, it may unlock a lot of doors (in T20 franchise cricket) for them as well,” said the 63-yearold who was India’s coach when they won the inaugural World T20 in 2007 and has also coached Afghanistan and Zimbabwe.Most UAE players are either of Indian or Pakistani origin and Rajput said a “good dressing atmosphere” was one of the major reasons for their series win over Bangladesh.“I always keep saying that it’s a team sport. The dressing room atmosphere should be good and weshould play as one unit. We have gelled well, and you can see from our performances. We always say it’s TEAM — Together Everyone Achieves More — sport, and we stick to it,” said Rajput.With the tournament being played at the start of the season in UAE, it will be interesting to see how the pitches will behave. Rajput believes the pitches at both the venues will be good for batting. He feels the Dubai wicket will be slightly on the slower side, while the one at Abu Dhabi will have some bounce and may seam as it is an open ground.","The United Arab Emirates (UAE) are hoping to upset one of the giants when the Asia Cup kicks off on Sept 9.

Kelly Osbourne publicly criticized Becky Lynch, calling out WWE for allowing remarks against her father Ozzy Osbourne



WWE is reportedly planning to issue an apology to Kelly Osbourne and her family



When WWE Women’s Intercontinental Champion Becky Lynch delivered a promo on RAW in Birmingham, England, it was meant to rile up the crowd. Instead, it sparked outrage far beyond the arena. Lynch referenced late rock legend Ozzy Osbourne in a way that struck a nerve with his daughter, Kelly Osbourne . Recently, Kelly blasted both the wrestler and WWE for crossing a line.During the heated segment, Becky Lynch dismissed Nikki Bella’s challenge to wrestle in Birmingham by taking a jab at the city and its most famous icon. “You can have your match but in Paris [at The Clash in Paris]. Because I am not wrestling in Birmingham. The only good thing that came out of here died a month ago,” Lynch said, drawing loud boos. She went further, adding, “But in fairness to Ozzy Osbourne, he had the good sense to move to L.A. , a proper city. Because if I lived in Birmingham, I’d die too.”Kelly Osbourne, still grieving her father’s passing on July 22 at age 76, called out the comments as cruel and unnecessary. On Instagram, she reacted with a fiery response. “You are a disrespectful dirtbag! Shame on the WWE for allowing such things to be said about my father and his home!!!” In a second post, she doubled down: “Birmingham would not piss on you if you were on fire.#Birminghamforever.”Her fury came just weeks after thousands of fans lined the streets of Birmingham to honor Ozzy during his funeral procession, led by Sharon Osbourne and their children. The heavy metal pioneer had performed one last hometown show shortly before his death, a marathon event that doubled as a Black Sabbath reunion.The backlash hasn’t stopped with Kelly’s social media posts. According to Wrestling Observer Live’s Bryan Alvarez, WWE itself is now dealing with internal fallout. “Kelly is not happy. I was told WWE is embarrassed, and they’re probably gonna do an apology. They may not, but if you look back at how many times WWE has actually apologized for something, it ain’t many,” Alvarez reported. He noted discussions about both a private and a public apology.Alvarez also suggested that Becky Lynch might not be the one to blame for the controversial line. “I don’t even really blame Becky, as I’m sure she didn’t come up with it, but she did it.” Former WWE star Lance Storm echoed that view, calling the decision to reference Ozzy’s death “cheap heat” and saying, “Unless you have explicit permission from the family, I think using someone’s passing for cheap heat is bad.”Also Read: “Fire her” – Becky Lynch’s comment on Ozzy Osbourne on Raw in segment with Nikki Bella sparks wild reaction As of now, the company has yet to issue a formal response, but with Kelly Osbourne demanding accountability, WWE may soon be forced to address the controversy directly.","Becky Lynch referenced late rock legend Ozzy Osbourne in a way that struck a nerve with his daughter, Kelly Osbourne.

Clare initially turned down Tommy Fleetwood before love story started

Clare Fleetwood ’s support during heartbreaking near-misses

Tommy Fleetwood is one of the top-paid golfers in the world as of August 2025. On the PGA Tour itself, he has won more than $31 million in prize money. This statistic makes him one of the biggest-money winners in the history of the DP World Tour, with a career earnings total of around $35 million.Other sources of income have also bolstered Fleetwood, but still has yet to nab a win on the PGA Tour. In addition, he has taken home sponsorship deals with Nike, TaylorMade, and TAG Heuer, benefitting from a significant amount of millions as a result of golf's former Player Impact Program.Tommy Fleetwood met his wife, Clare, in 2015, which further blended his personal and professional lives. Clare was then a sports management executive when she became Tommy's client. Their work was the beginning of what would soon become a deeper relationship, despite their 23-year age difference, and after the controversies from the media.Clare explained how she initially turned down Tommy when he first asked her out because the age gap made her feel cautious. But after further thought, she succumbed, and the couple entered a relationship that shocked the golf world.The pair had concerns about whether mixing business with romance would work, but agreed to give it six months to see how it went.So when they did, they were surprised to find that the two arrangements reinforced each other, professionally and personally. Clare, who maintains a cool and calm approach, has regularly been acknowledged as a reason Tommy stays composed and relaxed in stressful situations on the course.Apart from materialistic dividends, there have been some massive emotional ups and downs in Fleetwood’s professional career. Clare has remained his rock through his lowest lows, which include several painful near misses on the PGA Tour.None was more heartbreaking than the one he endured at the Travelers Championship as Tommy once again finished in second place, this time the victim of a late charge by Keegan Bradley to come up one stroke short of the winner. Enticing words like these have shaped his career narrative to date, so near, but not close enough to cement that first PGA Tour title.Going into the last 18 holes of the Tour Championship, Fleetwood was quoted as a fan's favourite, and Clare was back to have his back as always. Friends of the couple say Clare has been a great support to Tommy in dealing with the pressure, and his two losses have only made him more determined and focused towards the future.Also Read: Who is golfer Tommy Fleetwood’s wife Clare?

Cadillac's Bold Move: Bottas and Perez Join 2026 F1 Lineup for Competitive Edge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/cadillacs-bold-move-bottas-and-perez-join-2026-f1-lineup-for-competitive-edge/articleshow/123529342.cms,"Why Cadillac selected Sergio Perez and Valtteri Bottas for their 2026 F1 driver lineup

1. Proven race-winning pedigree

2. Veteran leadership and technical expertise

3. Opting for stability over risk

4. To create an inspiring redemption story

5. A statement of intent by Cadillac

Cadillac’s entry into Formula 1 has already made waves, but its first driver announcement might be even more eye-catching. For its 2026 debut season, the American manufacturer has confirmed Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez as its line-up. Both drivers return to the grid after sitting out 2025, offering Cadillac a unique blend of experience and proven pedigree.This article sheds light on five possible reasons for Cadillac to opt for these two veterans instead of banking on younger talent.In an environment as competitive as Formula 1, results speak louder than potential. Between them, Bottas and Perez have 16 Grand Prix victories, alongside dozens of podiums and years spent racing for top-tier outfits. Here are 5 possible reasons for this decision:Bottas has 10 wins and 20 poles to his name, mostly during his Mercedes partnership with Lewis Hamilton, while Perez became a fan favorite for his remarkable 2020 Racing Point victory and five subsequent triumphs with Red Bull.For Cadillac, hiring drivers who know how to win instantly adds credibility to a new team fighting to establish itself.Building a competitive F1 car from scratch requires more than speed behind the wheel, it demands detailed feedback, leadership in development, and calmness under pressure. Both drivers have reputations for working effectively with engineers and contributing to car performance beyond race day.Bottas’ years at Mercedes, where he learned in one of the sport’s most efficient operations, provide invaluable technical grounding. Perez, meanwhile, is admired for his adaptability and ability to maximize performance even when machinery isn’t at its best.Cadillac and its partners, General Motors and TWG Motorsports, had the option of chasing young, up-and-coming talents. But while rookies bring fresh energy, they also bring unpredictability. For a brand-new team, stability may have been a bigger priority.By selecting two seasoned drivers, Cadillac ensures that its first season won’t be spent managing rookie mistakes or inexperience. Instead, Bottas and Perez can guide the team through the steep learning curve of F1’s technical and competitive demands.Beyond the numbers, there’s a human element. Both Bottas and Perez faced challenging exits from Formula 1 at the end of 2024. Bottas de-signed after a low-key stint at Sauber, and Perez after a difficult final season at Red Bull. Neither driver wanted their careers defined by those final chapters.Cadillac offers them both a lifeline and a chance at redemption. Their hunger to prove themselves again could translate into the kind of determination a new team desperately needs.Last, but not least, the decision of signing Bottas and Perez by Cadillac sends a clear message that they are not in Formula 1 simply to participate. By putting two established race winners in its first car, the team shows it aims to compete, grow quickly, and earn respect on the grid.In Bottas and Perez, Cadillac hasn’t just signed F1 drivers, it has signed ambassadors for the project, leaders in the garage, and racers who know what it takes to stand on the top step.","Cadillac has confirmed Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez as its F1 line-up for 2026.

On his New Heights podcast, he admitted to considering life after the NFL, noting the physical demands of 12 seasons. His comments suggest that the 2025 season may be more of a farewell tour than just another campaign.Adding to the speculation is Kelce’s openness about how his relationship with Swift has influenced his perspective. In an interview with GQ, he praised her relatability and acknowledged how her world of music and entertainment has inspired him to think beyond football.With marriage and possibly family life now on the horizon, Kelce’s priorities seem to be shifting.Travis Kelce’s contract with the Chiefs runs through the 2025 season, setting up a natural endpoint for his career.

'I don’t understand Prince Harry’s anger': Butler challenges ‘evil stepmother’ Queen Camilla story — What really happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/i-dont-understand-prince-harrys-anger-butler-challenges-evil-stepmother-queen-camilla-story-what-really-happened/articleshow/123525991.cms,"Harry’s Private Note To Late Grandfather Prince Philip Sparks Backlash Online

The simmering tension between Prince Harry and Queen Camilla, long splashed across tabloids, has been reignited, but this time by someone unexpectedly in the middle of royal history. Former royal butler Grant Harrold, who served the monarchy for decades, is challenging the Duke of Sussex’s stark portrayal of his stepmother in his memoir Spare.In the explosive book, Harry branded Camilla “evil” and “wicked,” accusing her of tearing apart the family he cherished with Princess Diana. Yet Harrold’s recollections paint a different picture, one of warmth, laughter, and shared family moments.In his upcoming biography, The Royal Butler: My Remarkable Life of Royal Service, Harrold recounts the day Charles and Camilla wed in April 2005. “Charles and Camilla were catching a flight to head straight to Birkhall. We all went outside to wave them off and laughed as we saw William and Harry had decorated their car with ‘Just Married,’” he writes. He added that the brothers “raced after the car” as the couple drove off “through the arches to cheers,” a scene far removed from the cold animosity Harry described.Harrold insists he witnessed “no animosity” between Harry and Camilla. “The four of them, I promise you, got on so well. I saw them having dinners together, I saw them having drinks together, I saw them going to parties together,” he recalled.He also praised King Charles for his calm demeanor, noting, “He works hard and doesn’t suffer fools… he doesn’t once raise his voice.”A royal insider corroborated Harrold’s account, telling GB News that Harry seemed genuinely happy during the wedding celebrations and even took the lead in decorating his father’s Aston Martin. “I am sure there were mixed emotions over the years, but all I can tell you is how he seemed at the time,” the source said.Yet Harry’s memoir paints a more bitter picture. He claimed Camilla was “dangerous,” accused her of leaking details of his past drug use, and even compared her to the “wicked stepmothers in storybooks.” The stark contrast between Harry’s narrative and those who witnessed the events firsthand has sparked a debate over truth, perception, and memory within the royal family.As Harrold prepares to release his biography, royal watchers are left wondering: did Harry’s version of events obscure a more nuanced reality, or was it a reflection of long-held personal pain?","Former royal butler Grant Harrold is challenging Prince Harry's portrayal of his stepmother in his memoir Spare.

From feud to a possible reunion: Is a royal homecoming for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle with children on the cards? Royal experts spill the beans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/from-feud-to-a-possible-reunion-is-a-royal-homecoming-for-harry-and-meghan-with-children-on-the-cards-royal-experts-spill-the-beans/articleshow/123503589.cms,"Harry Reaches Out? Prince Invites King Charles Amid Hopes Of Reunion

For years, the rift between the royal family and the Sussexes has been the stuff of palace whispers, glossy magazine covers, and endless “sources close to” speculation. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have built a life on the other side of the Atlantic - swapping Buckingham Palace for Montecito mansions, royal duties for media deals, and the London fog for Californian sunshine. But is there a chance the family feud could finally ease? Some royal watchers say the door might just be creaking open.Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital that trust remains the sticking point. “I believe it to be totally correct that members of the royal family do not trust Meghan. And of course, she does not trust some members of the royal family in return,” he said.Still, Turner hinted that the narrative isn’t as black-and-white as it seems. “If every member of the royal family doesn’t trust Meghan, then why did King Charles instigate a meeting with his senior advisor and that of Harry and Meghan’s team? Is it all the royal family, or is it perhaps William?”Optimism, however, lingers. Turner hopes Harry, Meghan, and their children—Archie and Lilibet—will eventually be welcomed back “warmly” into the fold. Fellow commentator Ingrid Seward echoed the sentiment, telling Fox News Digital, “I feel that [this] won’t go on forever. I just feel that at some stage… they will begin to come together.”That said, Seward was quick to admit that Meghan remains deeply unpopular with hardcore royalists.The speculation is being fueled further by Harry’s scheduled trip to the UK in September. According to PEOPLE!, he’s set to appear at a charity event for WellChild, which supports children with life-limiting conditions.Whether this visit sparks a reunion with King Charles remains to be seen, but it has reignited questions about the Sussexes’ long-term ties to Britain.One factor pulling them back could be education.Former royal butler Grant Harrold told Style Caster that Harry may want Archie and Lilibet to experience the same schooling system he grew up with. “It’s very likely and it’s completely possible… But then it depends on how the relationship is with the rest of the family when the time comes.”But here’s the royal-sized hurdle: security. In ITV’s Tabloids on Trial, Harry admitted that safety concerns are the main reason Meghan avoids the UK. “They are genuine concerns for me… It's one of the reasons why I won’t bring my wife back to this country,” he said.A source close to him doubled down in Us Weekly: “He’ll always be fond of his home country, but the way he views it, his wife and kids are his priority.”","Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner says trust remains the sticking point.
