TOI has not verified the video's authenticity.No stranger to odd requests from voters and supporters, Rajput appears briefly stunned by the bizarre overture, only to quickly regain poise and assure the staffer that he would help him find a suitable match soon.Asked about his financial status, the employee tells Rajput that his monthly salary is around Rs 6,000 but he owns 13 bighas of land. At this, the MLA responds: ""You're quite well-off. I'll arrange your marriage soon.""As the discussion advances, Rajput asks if the employee would prefer a bride from his own caste or is open to other castes. The staffer tells the MLA he would like someone from his own caste. The legislator then encourages him to be more open-minded. ""Don't worry about caste.

Pakistan have given themselves the best chance in recent times of beating a top side in Test cricket after they set England a daunting target of 297 to win in the second match of the series in Multan on day three.A 65-run stand for the ninth wicket between Agha Salman (63) and Sajid Khan (22) bailed Pakistan out of trouble in their second innings, after they had slipped to 156 for 8.The hosts were eventually bowled out for 221 to add to their first-innings lead of 75 runs and set England the task of achieving the biggest chase in the fourth innings to win a Test match in Pakistan.But before that partnership between Salman and Sajid, a hilarious banter was caught on stump microphone between Salman and Noman Ali .After Noman played a shot for a single off his hips to deep square leg, Salman asked him ""did you play it?""""Khud hi maari hai na yeh (you played it)?"" Salman asked Noman.""Haan, haan! Poora tere bhai ne Lara wala. Dekha nahi? Yeh dekh (yes, just like Brian Lara , didn't you see it?)"" replied Noman, possibly pointing his partner towards the giant screen to look at the replay, which left a beaming smile on Salman's face.Coming back to the current state of the match, England had lost their openers Zak Crawley (3) and first-innings centurion Ben Duckett (0) cheaply before close of play on the third day.Ollie Pope (21*) and Joe Root (12*) were at the crease with the visitors' total reading 36 for 2, still 261 runs away from the target.England lead the series 1-0.",Pakistan set England a daunting target of 297 to win in second Test in Multan.

NEW DELHI: Team India faced a concerning moment as Rishabh Pant hobbled off the field after getting hit by the ball on his right knee while wicket-keeping during Day 2 of the first Test against New Zealand in Bengaluru on Thursday.The incident happened on the last ball of 37th over. Left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja came up with a flatter delivery which spun sharply from outside off. NZ batter Devon Conway went for a rash drive only to miss it, as the ball almost missed the off stump, eventually hitting Pant on the side of the right knee, which is not protected by pads.Pant immediately fell on the ground grimacing in pain.The physio had a good look at Pant's injury but finally he hobbled off the field with a lot of pain. Dhruv Jurel , subbed in for Pant, stepped onto the field with his pads and helmet.While the extent of the injury remains unclear, any setback to his recovery could impact India’s plans in the ongoing Test series and upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia.Fans and teammates are hoping for a speedy recovery, as Pant’s dynamic presence is vital for India’s middle-order stability.","Rishabh Pant hobbled off the field after getting hit by the ball on his right knee while wicket-keeping during Day 2 of the first Test against New Zealand in Bengaluru.

NEW DELHI: India captain Rohit Sharma expressed his disappointment and took responsibility for the team's poor performance after choosing to bat first against New Zealand in Bengaluru.The hosts were bundled out for a meager 46 runs in just 31.2 overs, marking their third-lowest Test score ever and their lowest at home.The Kiwi fast bowling duo of Matt Henry and William O'Rourke exploited the overcast conditions, sharing nine wickets between them.India's previous lowest Test score at home was 75 against the West Indies in New Delhi in 1987, while their overall lowest is 36 against Australia in Adelaide in 2020.They also fell for 42 against England at Lord's in 1974.""It was my misjudgement of the pitch,"" Rohit said.""I am hurting a little bit because I made that call.

BENGALURU: One of the most indelible images of the day — on a day full of them — was slip fielder KL Rahul ducking from a Tom Latham edge that whizzed past him at comfortable catching height. This was just after New Zealand had overhauled India’s first-innings score. Rahul’s reaction was that he just didn’t see it, read it, or even anticipate it. It summed up India’s dismal performance on the second day of the first Test against New Zealand.Consider this statistic: India were 46 all out in 31.2 overs in 163 minutes, New Zealand were 48 for no loss in 12.2 overs in 57 minutes. It was a narrative of contrasts on Thursday.New Zealand’s quicks, led by Matt Henry (5/15) and assisted by Williams O’Rourke (4/22), stunned the Indian batters and forced the crowd at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium into such silence that a casual observer would have believed a funeral was in progress.India, who enjoyed unparalleled success on home turf for over a decade, have mastered the art of dismantling records in the intervening period. On the day, Rohit Sharma and his men knocked off quite a few, but of the infamous kind.The total was India’s third lowest in a Test innings and the lowest at home. It was also the fourth-lowest first-innings score after electing to bat first. The five ducks in the innings are the joint second-highest and the second instance after the 1999 Mohali Test (also against NZ).At stumps, the visitors, riding on Devon Conway’s 105-ball 91 (11x4; 3x6), were 180/3 in 50 overs with a 134-run lead.Rain had washed out the opening day’s play on Wednesday and when play began on Thursday, the conditions were still overcast and the floodlights switched on. It seemed odd that India decided to go in with three spinners and to bat first.There is time enough in this Test for Rohit and the team thinktank to justify those decisions, but at the end of the first day, they appeared controversial calls.Bengaluru has a history of being unkind to teams that bat first on strips kept under wraps for the previous 24 hours or more. Batting in overcast conditions was never going to be easy but the Indians probably underestimated how difficult it could be.The pacers generated ample swing, the ball moved viciously, the bounce was generous, and the carry was well-suited for seamers which included the experienced Tim Southee. The Indians may have acquitted themselves had they applied themselves better and seen off the first hour instead of trying to counter-attack.New Zealand, in contrast, adapted quickly. They had two slips in place when play began and quickly beefed up the cordon once they realised just how helpful the conditions were to seamers.Still, half the Indians who beat a hasty retreat to the dressing room either gifted or threw their wickets away. That said, full credit to the Black Caps. The pace trio hit an unwavering line and length and the fielders were on the money, plucking the ball from the air and getting their hands on every half chance barring one, which made no difference.It took New Zealand eight deliveries before they began to pick India apart. Rohit led the batters parade. After surviving a close LBW decision on umpire’s call, he looked to break the shackles by stepping out against a Southee delivery. It jagged back and crashed into the stumps.In the absence of Shubman Gill, down with a stiff neck, Virat Kohli returned to the No. 3 slot after a long hiatus. Sarfaraz Khan took Gill’s place in the line-up. Even before he could get an eye in, O’Rourke, towering at six feet six inches, surprised Kohli with the extra bounce which took off the glove and Glenn Phillips dived low to snatch it at leg slip.What followed was carnage. Sarfaraz needlessly took the aerial route while Jaiswal, KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja found their plans going completely astray.","New Zealand's quicks stunned the Indian batters and forced the crowd at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium into such silence that a casual observer would have believed a funeral was in progress.

Ganguly to be part of auction, oversee WPL

NEW DELHI: In a one-of-a-kind move, the co-owners of Delhi Capitals have split responsibilities of the men’s and women’s teams in the IPL and Women’s Premier League (WPL).JSW group and GMR group, the equal owners of the franchise, have decided that each group will look after men’s and women’s teams on a two-year rotation basis. This means that GMR group will be in charge of Capitals for IPL seasons 2025 and 2026 while JSW will run the WPL team in these two seasons.“The strategic move aims at optimizing operational efficiency across teams within the ownership umbrella of the Delhi Capitals franchise,” a Capitals statement read.In the first move after the agreement, Delhi Capitals have appointed former India batter Hemang Badani as head coach (IPL) and Venugopal Rao as director of cricket (IPL).In July, the Capitals management had parted ways with Ricky Ponting, who had been head coach since 2018 while former India captain Sourav Ganguly was the director of cricket. Badani has been the head coach of Dubai Capitals team in ILT20, which is run by the GMR group.Sources said that the franchise may still be looking for a mentor. TOI understands that Zaheer Khan and Yuvraj Singh’s names were suggested to the management by the previous leadership group.Zaheer has joined Lucknow Super Giants while there is no confirmation from Yuvraj’s end. It is learnt that former India pacer Munaf Patel is in the running to be the bowling coach.“With the mega auction around the corner, my job, in collaboration with the rest of our coaching staff, is cut out. I can’t wait to get started,” Badani said.Ganguly will remain the director of cricket (WPL) for two years. However, he will be a part of the IPL mega auction and be actively involved in building the IPL team.“The roles will switch when JSW Sports takes over the running of the Men’s team in 2027. The business operations of the franchise, however, will continue to be run by the Delhi Capitals’ management team,” the Capitals statement said.Ganguly was on Thursday named as director of cricket for JSW Sports.",Delhi Capitals co-owners split responsibilities of men's and women's teams.

BENGALURU: Of the 80 deliveries that New Zealand pacer Matt Henry (5/15) bowled, none could be termed loose deliveries. His pace was complemented by precision and the seam and swing made him unplayable.The M Chinnaswamy stadium on Thursday was like a paradise for seamers and the trio of Tim Southee, Henry and William O’Rourke (4/22) made the most of the conditions, leaving just two Indian batters — Rishabh Pant (20) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (13) — with double-digit scores.When Henry dismissed Kuldeep to signal India’s dismissal for 46, it marked his 100th wicket and fourth five-wicket haul in his 26th Test appearance.Terming the toss “a good one to lose”, the 32-year-old Henry said, “We were going to bat first too. It was quite nice when those clouds started coming in after the toss was done, but I think we were expecting it to be probably a flatter wicket. There was plenty of assistance this morning, so it was great that we could make the most of it.”His first spell of six overs yielded one wicket, but the ensuing 7.2 fetched Henry four more.On his team’s plan, Henry pointed out, “We talked about being relentless with the ball and being patient. That was probably something that we looked to do, and thankfully it came off.”Highlighting “discipline” as one of the key factors on the day, the pacer dwelled on how they put into action lessons learned from India’s domination at home.“When you come here, you’re watching how the best in the world operate. Usually, discipline is second to none. It may not happen in the first spell or the second spell, but they keep coming back, and the same as India have done for many years. And watching how they go about their work here, they bring the stumps in play, and they’re able to make themselves a threat throughout, whether it’s a flat wicket or not. That was something we discussed,” Henry, who considered his fifer “a special achievement in India”, said.",New Zealand pacer Matt Henry (5/15) bowled 80 deliveries.

‘Replacing Pant a precautionary measure'

BENGALURU: His decision at the toss backfired. He managed two runs during his laboured 30-minute stay at the crease. His team tumbled for a record-low score. He was guilty of putting down a regulation catch and a half chance. Being Rohit Sharma wasn’t easy on Thursday.With India in dire straits on its home turf, all eyes were on Rohit. There were plenty of mistakes by the Indian team at the M Chinnaswamy stadium here, but Rohit shouldered all of it with humor and humility.During his post-match press conference, which lasted less than 10 minutes, there were times when Rohit was at a loss for words, but when asked about the call at the toss, he didn’t flinch before saying, “I did not read the pitch well enough and we sit in that situation today. We expected the pitch to be a little flatter than what it turned out to be. So clearly a misjudgement of the pitch. I am hurting a little bit because I made that call,” he rued.A thick cover of clouds hung heavy on the ground and it necessitated the use of floodlights, but it was surprising that India decided to go with two pacers and three spinners, bringing in Kuldeep Yadav for Akash Deep.Explaining the team call, Rohit outlined, “We felt there was no grass on the pitch. We thought it would do whatever it has to do in the first couple of sessions and then it is going to take turn as the game goes on. That is how it is whenever we play in India. The first session is always critical and then the wicket tends to settle down and then the spinners come into play.“We decided to add Kuldeep because he is bold on flat pitches and has taken wickets. We expected the pitch to be a little flatter than what it turned out to be.""Those who were not done in by good deliveries did not hesitate to shoot themselves. Like opener Yashasvi Jaiswal, who held one end together for over 100 minutes before he decided to cut William O’Rourke through point, but failed to keep it down and watched in disbelief as Ajaz Patel picked up a screamer at backward point.KL Rahul too floundered his wicket, while Ravindra Jadeja’s flick went astray. Five Indian batters failed to open their account.While Rohit was among the batters to struggle on the day, he backed the batting lineup.“Every batsman who went in had a plan of how to play because everyone knew what the pitch was and what was happening. But sometimes it happens that you are trying to do something and that plan does not work,” was his reasoning.In the 37th over of New Zealand’s innings, a Ravindra Jadeja delivery to Devon Conway spun sharply and hit Rishabh Pant’s right kneecap. The wicketkeeper fell to the ground grimacing in pain before he was helped off the ground.The situation seemed alarming considering it was the knee that had been operated upon after Pant’s lifethreatening car crash.“Unfortunately, the ball hit straight on his kneecap. He has a little swelling on it and the muscles are quite tender at this point in time. So, it (replacing Pant with Dhruv Jurel) is a precautionary measure. We do not want to take a risk,” skipper Rohit Sharma said.“Rishabh does not want to take a risk.

NAGPUR: After starting the Ranji Trophy campaign with a superb come-from-behind win, Vidarbha will look to carry forward the momentum against minnows Puducherry in their second Elite Group 'B' match starting from Friday at Cricket Association Puducherry's Siechem Ground.Facing an unfancied opponent, Vidarbha, apart from guarding against complacency, also have selection issues to sort out.The return of professional opener Dhruv Shorey and injury-induced absence of Umesh Yadav means the team think tank needs to rejig both the batting and bowling departments.After the first innings debacle against Andhra, everyone in the batting line-up had a good outing in the second essay in the opening match. Opener Atharva Taide posted a century while skipper Akshay Wadkar and Karun Nair scored 40-plus scores. Youngsters Aman Mokhade and Danish Malewar posted half-centuries in the second innings.With Shorey back in the squad, Vidarbha team management have three contenders - Yash Rathod, Mokhade and Malewar - vying for two spots in the batting line-up.On the other hand, Rathod, after a breakthrough last season, is yet to get back into the runs. His first match returns - a duck and five - weren't up to the mark. But it would be harsh on the young and talented southpaw batter to be benched after just a couple of lean matches.In the bowling department, spinners - veteran offie Akshay Wakhare and left-arm spinner Harsh Dubey - are certain to play, barring of course last-minute injury scares. Aditya Thakare, with a second innings four-for against Andhra, is assured of leading the seam attack but the same can't be said about his medium pace partners.Nachiket Bhute, who started the bowling attack in Andhra's second innings after Umesh Yadav got injured, bowled 27 overs across both innings for just one wicket. Over the years, Vidarbha have preferred a three-pronged pace attack. If the team management decides to continue with the trend, they will have to pick two of the three inexperienced pacers - Nachiket Bhute, Shubham Kapse and Praful Hinge - at their disposal.Akshay Wadkar (Captain & WK), Atharva Taide (VC), Karun Nair, Dhruv Shorey, Yash Rathod, Aman Mokhade, Danish Malewar, Akshay Wakhare, Aditya Thakare, Harsh Dubey, Nachiket Bhute, Akshay Karnewar, Shubham Kapse, Siddhesh Wath (WK), Yash Kadam, Praful Hinge, Parth Rekhade.Arun Karthik (C), Ankit Sharma (VC), Aman Khan, Abin Mathew, Anand Bais, Fabid Ahmed, Gaurav Yadav, Akash Kargave, Marimuthu Vikneshwaran, Parameeswaran Sivaraman, Premraj Rajavelu, Ramachandran Ragupathy, Ritesh Gudge, Ajay Rohera, Paras Ratnaparkhe, Sagar Udeshi, Saurabh Yadav.",Vidarbha play Puducherry in their second Elite Group 'B' match.

India batters embarrass in Bengaluru | What's happening at Delhi Capitals? | Beyond the Boundary

NEW DELHI: Former Indian spinner Anil Kumble expressed his doubts about the Indian team's choice to have Virat Kohli bat at number three in the first Test match against New Zealand. Kumble believes that Kohli performs best when he bats at number four.In the first innings, during the ninth over, Virat was dismissed for a duck by pacer William O'Rourke after facing just nine balls.The dismissal came shortly after New Zealand had already claimed the wicket of captain Rohit Sharma.Virat, trying to defend on his toes, saw the ball glance off his top glove and fly towards Phillips at leg gully, who took a brilliant catch.In his comments to JioCinema, Kumble criticized the decision to have Kohli bat at number three. He pointed out that the team required a player like Cheteshwar Pujara to fill that position, and his absence was noticeable during the match.""Virat Kohli should have batted at No. 4, he is your number one batter at that position. For the number three position, [you need] someone like Cheteshwar Pujara, who did so well for so many years playing there. [After] 100 Test matches, because he would have been there today, then I do not think he would have gone looking to hit,"" Kumble said.""He (Pujara) would have allowed the ball to come on, and that's where you miss someone with that kind of approach today. And India is certainly in a spot of bother here,"" he added.At number four, Kohli has amassed 7,355 runs in 91 Tests and 148 innings, averaging 52.53, with 25 centuries and 21 fifties. His highest score at this position is an unbeaten 254. In contrast, at number three, he has struggled, managing only 97 runs in seven innings at an average of 16.16, with a top score of 41.This year, in four Tests, Virat has scored 157 runs in seven innings, averaging 26.16, with no fifties and a best score of 47.In the ongoing ICC World Test Championship 2023-25, Virat has scored 468 runs in 11 innings across seven matches, averaging 46.80, with one century, two fifties, and a highest score of 121.The 2020s have not been the most successful period for Kohli as a Test player. In 32 Tests during this decade, he has scored 1,745 runs in 55 innings at an average of 32.92, with just two centuries and eight fifties, with a highest score of 186.India's decision to bat first after winning the toss proved to be a mistake, as the overcast conditions favored the pace bowlers. The Indian batting lineup crumbled, managing a meager total of 46 runs. Rishabh Pant , with 20 runs, and Yashasvi Jaiswal, with 13, were the only batsmen to reach double figures.The New Zealand bowlers, particularly Matt Henry and William O'Rourke, exploited the conditions brilliantly. Henry claimed five wickets for just 15 runs, while O'Rourke picked up four wickets for 22 runs, dismantling the Indian batting order.",Former Indian spinner Anil Kumble has expressed his doubts about the Indian team's choice to have Virat Kohli bat at number three in the first Test match against New Zealand.

Ranji Trophy: Upbeat Bengal eye maximum points vs Bihar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ranji-trophy-upbeat-bengal-eye-maximum-points-vs-bihar/articleshow/114323952.cms,"Abhimanyu Easwaran. (ANI Photo)

KOLKATA: The last time Bengal played Bihar in a Ranji Trophy match, the game got over inside three days with Bengal winning by an innings and 204 runs at the Eden Gardens . Not much has changed in eight months since then as far as form and performance of the two sides are concerned as Bengal come to host their neighbours again in an Elite Group 'C' second-round match at the Bengal Cricket Academy ( BCA ) ground in Kalyani on Friday.Bengal, under new skipper Anushtup Majumder , will be upbeat after bagging three points in their first match against Uttar Pradesh and will look to strengthen their qualification chances for the knockouts by winning maximum points against a struggling Bihar side which caved in within two days on way to suffering an innings defeat against Haryana in their last match.More than the opposition, it is the weather that is keeping the Bengal camp a bit worried with prediction of sporadic rains likely to hamper action.Bengal seemed to have found the remedy to their opening woes that kept troubling them last season with Sudip Chatterjee, making a comeback to the side after playing two seasons for Tripura, stitching together a good partnership with Abhimanyu Easwaran coming up the order. Both the Bengal openers got centuries in the first match and coach Laxmi Ratan Shukla will look for another good start from the duo. Easwaran, who is on a roll getting four tons in his last four first-class matches, will love to make his 100th first-class match memorable by piling up more runs to stake his claim as a reserve opener in the India squad for the series Down Under next month. Incidentally the right-handed opener hit an unbeaten 200 against Bihar in February this year.The team management will look for more meaningful contribution from the middle order consisting skipper Majumder, wicketkeeper-batter Abhishek Porel, Wriddhiman Saha and Shahbaz Ahmed after they collapsed in the last match.Bengal, however, might have to go for some forced changes as Saha is doubtful with back spasms. In case the former India wicketkeeper fails to recover, Avlin Ghosh or Shuvam Dey might get a look in. There is also a thought about resting pacer Mukesh Kumar to keep him fresh for the tougher challenges ahead. Rookies Rohit Kumar or Rishav Vivek can then join the pace brigade of Mohammed Kaif and Suraj Sindhu Jaiswal.It remains to be seen whether Writtick Chatterjee will get another chance after a below par show in the last match as Pradipta Pramanik and Aamir Gani wait for their opportunities.Bihar, on the other hand, will be led by Veer Pratap Singh, who played a good part of his cricket for Bengal once. The right-arm pacer remains the team's only experienced player and much will depend on his shoulders to help Bihar at least make a match out of it.","Bengal take on Bihar in a Ranji Trophy match on Friday.

NEW DELHI: Matt Henry , the New Zealand pacer, etched his name in the record books with a stunning five-wicket haul during the first Test against India at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Thursday. He became the Kiwi bowler with the most economical fifer in Test cricket history.India, having won the toss, chose to bat first. However, this decision proved to be a mistake as the pace-friendly conditions and overcast skies favored the bowlers.India was bundled out for a mere 46 runs, with only Rishabh Pant (20) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (13) managing to reach double figures.On day two of the first Test, following a washout on day one due to rain, Henry capitalized on the damp pitch and overcast conditions, decimating the Indian batting line-up.In his spell of 13.2 overs, he claimed 5/15 with an economy rate of 1.10, the lowest by a Kiwi bowler in a Test fifer. His victims included key players such as Sarfaraz Khan , Pant, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, and Kuldeep Yadav.Henry's figures are the fourth-best by a Kiwi pacer in India, behind Tim Southee (7/64 in 2012 at Bengaluru), Dion Nash (6/27 in Mohali at 1999), and Richard Hadlee (6/49 in Wankhede in 1988).Additionally, Henry reached the milestone of 100 Test wickets, becoming the second-fastest NZ player to achieve this feat in 26 Tests, tied with Neil Wagner and Bruce Taylor. The fastest Kiwi bowler to reach 100 Test wickets is Hadlee, who accomplished it in 25 Tests.This match marks only the second instance when visiting pacers have taken all 10 wickets against India in a Test innings, with both occurrences coming from New Zealand, in 2012 and in this match.","New Zealand's Matt Henry takes five-wicket haul in first Test against India.

They arrived early in Guwahati to beat the inclement weather at home that had deemed even training impossible. But on Thursday, Chennaiyin FC made sure of bringing the fans at home the gift of the second win of the season, despite another late fightback from NorthEast United FC In the end, the Highlanders supporters could not witness an encore of their point-yielding late show of the last two games as 10-man Chennaiyin held their fort and snatched away a 3-2 Indian Super League win at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium in Guwahati.Former NEUFC recruit Wilmar Jordan Gill (25’, 51’) made an impressive comeback into Owen Coyle ’s starting XI this season with a crucial brace from set-pieces on either side of Lucas Brambilla’s (36’) goal from the spot despite NEUFC making a dream start with a 5th-minute opener by Nestor Albiach.Juan Pedro Benali’s men also came hard at the visitors in quest for at least a point after Laldinliana Renthlei was sent off the field for a second yellow card in the 83rd minute.Their wonder recruit Alaeddine Ajaraie was once again on the scoresheet – becoming only the second player after Chennaiyin’s former star striker Elano Blumer to score in all his first five games in ISL – when he put the ball in the opposition net from a confident penalty kick.However, Ajaraie, who was brilliant throughout the game but also missed a couple of sitters, was not able to add further to the score thereafter as Chennaiyin strived to maintain the one-goal lead to take away all three points on offer.The victory took Coyle’s side to the fifth spot with seven points from four matches – a jump of three spots on the ISL table.

KATHMANDU: India made an excellent start to their SAFF Women's Championship 2024 campaign as they outclassed Pakistan 5-2 in a Group A match at the Dasharath Stadium on Thursday. The five-time champions led 4-1 at half time.While India grabbed three points with consummate ease in the opening game of the three-team group that also has Bangladesh , the match marked skipper Ashalata Devi 's 100th appearance for the Blue Tigresses and the 50th international goal of prolific striker Ngangom Bala Devi , who became the first Indian woman footballer to do so.While Grace Dangmei (2), Manisha, Bala Devi and Jyoti Chauhan scored for India, Suha Hirani and Kayla Marie Siddique found the net for Pakistan.The two traditional rivals have so far met four times in the international arena and India emerged triumphant on all occasions.With a goodly crowd present at the Dasharath Stadium to witness the clash of the arch-rivals, India wasted no time to launch an onslaught that fetched them the first goal in the fifth minute.The Pakistan defence, which had a rather difficult time to contain an overlapping Ranjana Chanu on the left, had the first test of the wing back when she sliced in to send a cross that was converted smoothly by Player of the Match Grace Dangmei with a shot from outside the box.If this was a fine strike and the result of a well-rehearsed move, then the next three goals also didn't lag behind in class and character.The second goal in the 17th minute had the signature of Bala Devi's skills written all over as the seasoned campaigner gave a through pass that had the entire Pakistan defence rattled. Manisha found the pass and beat goalkeeper Nisha Ashraf with a left-footer.Then came the moment of glory for Bala Devi. The elegant striker was spotted wiping her tears when the national anthem was played at the start of the match.In the 35th minute she banged the net off an indirect free-kick. The stamp of class the shot carried with it proved too much for the rival custodian.After Grace scored her second and India's fourth goal in the 42nd minute off another Ranjana cross, Pakistan pulled one back just before half time when India conceded a penalty. Suha Hirani's was an angular one to the top corner and Panthoi Chanu had little chance against it.India's neighbours suddenly looked rejuvenated after finding the target for the first time. They scored another through Kayla Marie Siddique immediately after the half taking full advantage of some confusion in the rival's area.As Pakistan pressed on the gas in search of more success upfront, their challenges were finally quelled with the fifth goal when substitute Jyoti Chauhan neatly heading in a Dalima Chhibber corner in the 78th minute to score her first senior India goal.",India made an excellent start to their SAFF Women's Championship 2024 campaign as they outclassed Pakistan 5-2 in a Group A match at the Dasharath Stadium on Thursday.

As Indian Super League ( ISL ) returns from the international break with NorthEast United FC hosting Chennaiyin FC at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium in Guwahati on Thursday, the home side will look to start afresh and comeback to winning ways.Beginning their ISL journey this season with a 1-0 away win over debutant Mohammedan Sporting Club, NEUFC have lost one and drawn two games thereafter. Sitting in sixth position on the league table, the Juan Pedro Benali-coached side will aim for a win in their fifth tie against the southern opponents, who have four points after three games.Speaking about their opponents, NorthEast head coach Juan Pedro Benali said that the Marina Machans are physically very strong.“We’re playing against a nice team, a team who has a very peculiar style. Owen Coyle ’s style, we know it. They’re a strong team, physically very strong and they don’t give you a chance to breathe. And we hope at home we can do much better than the last game and get the three points,” Benali said in Guwahati on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Chennaiyin have experienced all three results possible once each, and have undergone quite a similar fate like NEUFC after a winning start to the league. They have been on the road for two out of their first three matches this season. Speaking to the media ahead of their third away tie, head coach Owen Coyle praised NorthEast while highlighting the need for his boys to be more clinical.“What you have is two very good teams,” Coyle said on the eve of the game. “Two very attack-minded teams, going all out to win a tough game. NorthEast are always a very dangerous opponent — they were last year and they certainly are this year. I think Juan Pedro Benali has done a fantastic job.”“Equally, we know we have a good team, we know we have good players and can stand toe-to-toe with the best teams in this league when we are at our best. So that’s our focus, being very respectful of our opponents but focusing on our qualities. In truth, we should probably be sitting with 7-9 points; in the last two games alone, we had just under 40 chances, so we know we have to be more clinical,” Coyle added.Due to heavy rainfall in Chennai, the Marina Machans had to travel to Guwahati pretty early to resume training. Expressing his gratitude to the Highlanders for opening their facilities early, the Scottish coach wished for the safety of the people back home.“We haven’t been able to train for the last three days because of the severe weather in Chennai. But, more importantly, we want to make sure everyone’s safe and well, so that’s the priority,” Coyle said.",NorthEast United FC host Chennaiyin FC at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium in Guwahati on Thursday.

To have the chance to represent England is a huge privilege, and the opportunity to work with this special and talented group of players is very exciting.""Tuchel won league titles at PSG and Bayern and the German Cup with Dortmund, but his greatest success came during his time in English football at Chelsea.He led the Blues to Champions League glory just months after taking charge in 2021 and also won the UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup with the London club.Tuchel was sacked in September 2022 in a bold early move by Chelsea's new ownership group that did not pay off.He becomes the permanent successor to Southgate, who led the Three Lions to back-to-back finals of the European Championship, plus a World Cup semi-final and quarter-final in his four major tournaments in charge.England, though, are still yet to win a major men's tournament since the 1966 World Cup on home soil.""We are thrilled to have hired Thomas Tuchel, one of the best coaches in the world,"" said FA CEO Mark Bullingham.""Since Gareth resigned, we have worked through the candidate pool, meeting a number of coaches and evaluating them against that criteria.""Thomas was very impressive and stood out with his vast expertise and his drive.""Tuchel will inherit a richly talented generation of players, including Harry Kane, Jude Bellingham and Cole Palmer, that will be among the favourites for the 2026 World Cup .","Thomas Tuchel named England's new manager on Wednesday.

Scotland frustrated Cristiano Ronaldo 's Portugal in a 0-0 draw at Hampden on Tuesday to avoid losing five consecutive competitive games for the first time ever.The home side needed a wonder save from Craig Gordon to deny Bruno Fernandes a winner in the closing stages, but held out to secure their first point in the top tier of the Nations League .Portugal remain on top of Group A1 but were made to wait to book their place in March's quarter-finals.On his 216th international appearance, Ronaldo made his 200th start for his country, more than 21 years on from his first.However, the 39-year-old failed to add to his 133 Portugal goals and stormed off the field at full-time ranting at the officials.Scotland have won just one of their last 16 games - a 2-0 friendly victory over Gibraltar in June - and remain without a victory in a competitive match for over a year.But Steve Clarke 's men battled hard to stop the rot in Glasgow.Scotland even had the best chance of the first half inside the opening five minutes whenScott McTominay headed too close to Diogo Costa from point-blank range.Portugal quickly took control of possession without creating clear-cut chances.Francisco Conceicao spooned over early in the second period from Ronaldo 's lay-off.Ronaldo then fired inches wide after making himself room for a shot amid a flurry of desperate challenges from Scottish defenders.But it was Fernandes who had the best chance to claim all three points when the Manchester United captain's powerful low strike was brilliantly parried by Gordon and collected at the second attempt by the 41-year-old goalkeeper.Scotland are still on course for relegation from the top tier of the Nations League as they trail Poland, who drew 3-3 with Croatia, by three points with two games remaining.Croatia sit second, three points behind the Portuguese, who they host next month.","Portugal remain on top of Group A1 but were made to wait to book their place in March's quarter-finals.

Every kid watches cartoons, right? But I didn’t watch cartoons. I just used to watch sports, tennis specially.“So, my parents were like, ‘she likes it.We have to put her on to that’. So my uncle, he knows tennis coaches. But when I started at the age of 3, the coach was like ‘no, she’s small. She can’t play, she cannot understand anything'.“But I was happy to play tennis, and I was interested in playing tennis.”That was a decade ago, in Mendhasala in Odisha Now 14, not a grown-up yet, Aahan announced her arrival on the big stage by claiming a double crown, the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week.It gets ever more incredible when you consider that she entered the Under-16 event as a qualifier and went all the way. Besides, she also played doubles in U-16, losing in the second round though.In the U-16 final, Aahan beat Aishwarya Jadhav , the eighth seeded Maharashra girl against whom she has a 1-1 head to head in the ITF juniors circuit. Aishwarya, two years older than the Odisha girl, had won her first juniors title in a Grade 5 tournament in Ahmedabad recently.“I’m happy, but it was very tough,” Aahan, who is currently coached by Santosh Malik, said.“Each and every round was tough. But I was just focused on each and every point. Like, I want to win this point, and next point, like that. So I was fully focused and my target was (to) win both the tournaments.So, I tried my best and the rest is the result (two titles).”Aahan’s first coach was Ajay Nishank, under whose tutelage she was until a year ago when she started working with Malik. She also has access to the Abhinav Bindra Targeting Performance (ABTP) centre in Bhubaneswar, where she is one of the athletes from various disciplines who get free fitness training under a programme by the Odisha state government ’s department of sports.She, along with Tavish Pahwa, was a part of the Asian junior team that was picked for an European exposure trip under the Grand Slam Player Development Programme of the ITF earlier this year.“In Europe, it was tough matches and I was a little bit nervous. But when I started winning matches, then I started to feel confident, like ‘yeah, I can beat them’,” she said.Aahan, while brimming with confidence and optimism, is also aware which areas of her game she has to improve.“I have to improve my serve and forehand. And a little bit in volleys,” she said.“I’m good in volleys. When I play doubles, I do good volleys. But in singles I have to do better because, you know, in singles that is tough. You have to cover the full court.“Like, if the opponent is giving you a lob, you have to cover that. You have to be confident, ‘yeah, I can do this. So I’ll go (up) front’.”For a youngster of her age, Aahan has remarkable clarity of what her long terms goals are and how to get there.“Yeah, in ITF, I want to be in top 100, so I can play the WTA (Tour events). In juniors, if I get in top 100, I’ll get a chance to play junior slams like the Australia open or US Open Junior slam.“Then, I can learn and work more on that thing, and then I’ll collect the points in ITF. Then I can play the Slams.”","Aahan won the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week.

Shanghai, Oct 13, 2024 -Novak Djokovic insisted Sunday that he plans ""to compete and play next season"" despite suffering another loss at the hands of world number one Jannik Sinner .The 37-year-old Serb, the holder of a men's record 24 Grand Slam titles , went down 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 to the Italian in the final of the Shanghai Masters .However, Djokovic said he has no intention of following career-long rival Rafael Nadal into retirement even though he endured by his own admission ""one of the worst-performing seasons in terms of results"".""I don't know what the future brings, I'll just try to kind of go with the flow to see how I feel in a given moment but I still plan to compete and play next season,"" he told reporters.Djokovic failed to add to his Grand Slam haul in 2024 as Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz , who claimed the French Open and Wimbledon titles, took possession of the sport's major honours.However, Djokovic was crowned Olympic champion , winning an emotional roller-coaster of a final against Alcaraz in Paris in August. That was his 99th career title.Sunday's loss left him frustratingly short of becoming just the third man after Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer to win 100 titles.""It's not a live-or-die type of goal for me, I think I've achieved all of my biggest goals in my career,"" he said.""Right now it's really about Slams and about still seeing how far I can kind of push the bar for myself.""Djokovic hailed Sinner who at 23 is 14 years his junior. His title in Shanghai was his seventh of the year.""He's very solid from the forehand and backhand, doesn't make too many mistakes, and just tries to take away the time from the opponent,"" said Djokovic.""That's something that reminds me of myself throughout my career, that's what I've done for so many years consistently, playing fast-paced tennis , taking away time from the opponent, kind of suffocating the opponent in a certain way.""","Novak Djokovic says he plans ""to compete and play next season"" The Serb lost 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 to Jannik Sinner in the final of the Shanghai Masters.

SEMI LOOMS

SHANGHAI: Former world number one Novak Djokovic , the last surviving member of tennis' ""Big Four"", said he does not plan on stopping any time soon but admitted that the retirement of rivals Roger Federer Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal has been overwhelming.Djokovic, Federer, Nadal and Murray were dubbed the ""Big Four"" during a period of dominance when they won a combined 69 Grand Slam titles and were involved in some of the most memorable matches of the last two decades.Spain's Nadal, who won a record 14 French Open titles, announced on Thursday that he would call time on his career after next month's Davis Cup. Murray retired after this year's Paris Olympics and Federer bowed out in 2022.Speaking after beating Czech Jakub Mensik in the Shanghai Masters quarter-finals on Friday, Djokovic said: ""(Nadal) has been my greatest rival. The rivalry I had with him has impacted me the most in my career by far.""We knew that that moment is coming sooner than later, but it's still a shock, you know.""Roger a few years ago, when he announced retirement and Andy as well this year. I mean, it's a bit overwhelming for me to be honest. I don't know what to make out of it. I still enjoy competing. But part of me left with them, a big part of me.""In his 6-7 (4), 6-1, 6-4 win over Mensik, who was born over a year after Djokovic played his first match on the ATP Tour in 2004, the Serb was pushed hard but fought back to clinch the win.It ensured his progression to a record-extending 78th ATP Masters 1000 semi-final - two more than Nadal.""These kind of matches, against teenagers, it's something that really motivates me,"" Djokovic told reporters after the win.""It keeps me going, and pushes me to really dig deep, and to show to the world that I still got it in my legs, that I can still go the distance with the young guys.""I'm super glad that I managed to win this very challenging match.""Djokovic faces world number seven Taylor Fritz in the semi-finals on Saturday after the American defeated Belgian David Goffin 6-3 6-4 earlier on Friday.""I'm going to have a big server opponent tomorrow, Fritz, so I have to be ready for another difficult match,"" the 24-times Grand Slam champion said.""Quick conditions, if you serve well it's quite a big advantage.""We are entering the last couple of matches of the tournament, and now is the time for me to really try to step it up even more, and hopefully I can get a chance to be in the finals.""","Novak Djokovic says the retirement of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal has been overwhelming.

TOI takes a look at the best five from both these famous rivalries:Federer was the undisputed king and even though he had lost to Rafa the previous year, the Swiss was just unstoppable at that point.Nadal had won the first two sets and was well on course to stopping Federer from winning his first Sunshine Double, but the experience of the Swiss helped him win 2-6, 6-7, 7-6, 6-3, 6-1.Rafa had beaten Federer in the 2005 French Open semifinal, but the rivalry on clay hadn't been settled yet. The Rome final was the first of the clay swing that year and if Federer had won this match, the head-to head on this surface might not have looked as lop-sided. Federer had two match-points in the fifth set Nadal prevailed 6-7, 7-6, 6-4, 2-6, 7-6.Rafa's autobiography starts with how he was feeling when there was a rain-break in this final during the fifth set. The Spaniard had lost the earlier two Wimbledon finals to his greatest adversary and when he went two sets up. Federer then played some of his best tennis to win the next two in tie-breakers. The rain breaks, the fading light - everything added to the drama, till Rafa held after breaking Federer in the 15th game of the fifth set to win 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 , 6-7 , 9-7.Though Nadal had won the Wimbledon final the year before, the popular mandate was Federer was the better player on faster courts. This was the first time they were playing in a Grand Slam outside Roland Garros and SW19, and the stakes were massive. In a match that went to and fro, Nadal prevailed 7-5, 3-6, 7-6, 3-6, 6-2. The loss left Federer in tears and as he cried, it was Rafa who consoled him on the podium.Both were coming back after massive injuries and it was a surprise that the two made the final. Federer attacked like never before using his single-handed backhand as an explosive weapon. But Rafa weathered the storm and was up a break in the fifth set. The last four games of that match was probably the best Federer had ever played while trailing against Nadal. He eventually won 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3.Nadal was trying to emulate Federer and a select few in the history of men's tennis to win all four Majors. Djokovic, around that time, was establishing himself as the best player on hard courts. But Nadal was just in a league of his own that year after winning his second Wimbledon title and went on to beat Novak 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 and make a place for himself in history.Five hours, 53 minutes - it went on for that long and by the end of it, the two struggled to stand on their feet in the humidity of Melbourne during the prize distribution ceremony. The fortunes fluctuated, but Novak stood strong. Nadal led 4-2 in the fifth but Novak's resilience came through in a 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-7(5), 7-5 win.Many call it the greatest clay court match of the new millennium. Novak was desperate to break his Roland Garros jinx but Rafa was just being Rafa. He said after winning the four hour 37 minute thriller 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-7, 7-5: ""You need to love this game…I lost a similar one in Australia, but this one was for me.""Another epic encounter that rolled over to the next day, the match carrying on for an unreal 5hr 15min on grass-court. Novak wasn't at his best after coming back from an injury, but he refused to give up. On Saturday afternoon, the final scoreline read 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (9), 4-6, 10-8 in favour of the Serb as the tennis world revelled at the jaw-dropping resilience of the two champions.Nadal had blown away Novak in the 2020 French Open final.
