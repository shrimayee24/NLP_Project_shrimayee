However, Manika maintained her stranglehold on the match, extending her advantage to 5-1.The Indian strategically targeted Prithika's backhand, exploiting her weakness and further solidifying her position at 8-4.Prithika, who was behind 5-10, managed to make the game competitive by securing four consecutive points. However, Manika required just a single point to seal the game.Unfortunately for the local favorite, she committed an error by hitting a backhand drive into the net, handing the game and a commanding 3-0 lead to the Indian paddler.In the fourth game, Manika's powerful forehand helped her establish a 10-5 advantage, putting her in a position to claim the match with five opportunities.On the third match point, Prithika faltered, sending her backhand shot into the net, allowing Manika to clinch the victory in just 37 minutes.","Manika Batra beats Prithika Pavade in straight games.

EXPLAINED: A field-player replacing goalkeeper - the move that helped India salvage a point against Argentina at Paris Olympics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/explained-a-field-player-replacing-goalkeeper-the-move-that-helped-india-salvage-a-point-against-argentina-at-paris-olympics/articleshow/112112545.cms,"THE RULE OVER THE YEARS

Here's what rule 2.2 under the 'Composition of Teams' header in the 'FIH Rules of Hockey' states:

INDIA AT PARIS OLYMPICS

A barrage of attacks by India in the first quarter, including a shot from Abhishek hitting the crossbar on the Argentine post, suggested a goal was around the corner for the Tokyo bronze medallist. But until the 59th minute, it was the 2016 Olympic champions who held onto their 1-0 lead in the Pool B match of the Paris Olympics .A soft error by PR Sreejesh on a miscued hit by Lucas Martinez saw the tenacious Argentina taking the lead in the 22nd minute, and they hung onto it deep into the fourth quarter.In the 56th minute, desperate to find the equalizer, India took their trusted custodian Sreejesh off the pitch to have an extra field-player in the form of attacker Gurjant Singh at their disposal.The move to bring an extra field-player into the attack did the trick for India, enabling a relentless attack on the Argentine circle and a video referral that gave India a penalty corner in the 59th minute. Skipper Harmanpreet Singh scored off it to earn India a point when all seemed lost.As soon as it was 1-1, India brought Sreejesh back to guard the post for the last minute, taking defender Jarmanpreet Singh off. The teams shared the spoils, taking home one point each.Teams taking their goalkeepers off the pitch in the dying stages of the 60-minute game is a common sight in hockey , especially in matches during elite competitions like the Olympics and World Cups where each goal, each point, and every win matters.So the side that is trailing or is in must-win situations during such big matches usually brings in an extra field-player.In literal sense, it's the last throw of the dice by the team desperate to find goal(s) before a match ends.""Each team has either a goalkeeper on the field or plays only with field players. Each team may play with:– a goalkeeper wearing a different-colour shirt and protective equipment comprising at least headgear, leg guards and kickers; this player is referred to in these Rules as a goalkeeper; or– only field-players; no player has goalkeeping privileges or wears a different-colour shirt; no player may wear protective headgear except a face mask when defending a penalty corner or a penalty stroke; all team players wear the same colour shirt.""Until 2019 a field-player replacing a goalkeeper used to have goalkeeping privileges and wore a different-colour vest over the team jersey, often termed as a kicking-back in the hockey circles. But the rule has been amended as above since then.As far as the Paris Games are concerned, India now have four points from a win (3-2) against New Zealand and the draw (1-1) against Argentina so far in Pool B with matches left to play against Ireland, Belgium and Australia.Top four teams from the two pools go through to the quarter-finals.",India drew 1-1 with Argentina in their Pool B match at the Paris Olympics. Harmanpreet Singh scored a penalty corner in the 59th minute to earn India a point.

This approach seemed to unsettle Panghal, who opted for a defensive strategy, a move that ultimately did not play out in his favour against the third-seeded Zambian.Despite Panghal's commendable track record, including a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in 2022, he found it challenging to counter the tactics of his opponent, resulting in scores of 29-28, 27-28, 28-29, 27-30, and 28-29 across the board.The initial rounds saw Panghal trailing on three cards due to a split decision, prompting him to adopt a more aggressive approach in an attempt to turn the tide.However, his efforts to land effective punches were met with limited success, and the second round was also awarded to Chinyemba by the judges.In the final three minutes of the bout, both competitors engaged in significant exchanges, with Panghal striving to apply pressure.

NEW DELHI: In 1928, Indian hockey embarked on a journey that got written and rewritten in 'golden' words, where the team won medals for 10 Olympics in a row. The 44-year run of consecutive podium finishes included a period of 28 years that saw a couple of World Wars, India getting independence and six Olympic editions where the hockey team won six successive gold medals without losing a match.At the 1952 Helsinki Games, wrestler KD Jadhav won India's first post-independence individual medal, a bronze.It was the first occasion when the hockey team's medal had company. But what hockey kept waiting for, since winning its first medal on 26th May 1928, was an Indian 'team' from another sport to join it as an Olympic medal winner.That wait ended after 96 years on July 30th 2024, at the Paris Games when the shooting duo of Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh became the first Indian 'team' apart from hockey to win an Olympic medal.is how hockey legend and three-time Olympic medallist Harbinder Singh reacted in surprise when Timesofindia.com reached out to him over the phone for his reaction on the unique parallel of Manu and Sarabjot's bronze-medal win. The Indians defeated their South Korean opponents, Oh Ye Jin and Wonho Lee, 16-10 on Tuesday in the third-place playoff in the10m air pistol mixed team event.It was Manu's second medal of the Games, after she opened India's account in Paris with a bronze in the women's 10m air pistol individual event.""These two young kids have done well. Good for hockey to have company now with another team, as you pointed out. It never struck me,"" he added.""It still gives me goosebumps when I think of winning the gold medal by beating Pakistan in the (Tokyo) 1964 final, after we had lost to them in the final of the (Rome) 1960 Olympics,"" Harbinder recalled. ""I remember we landed at the Palam airport in Delhi and the entire airport was packed with fans who had come to welcome us.""Talking about similarities to hockey's 96-year wait for an Indian 'team' from another sport to win an Olympic medal, it took 44 years after KD Jadhav's 1952 bronze to have another individual Olympic medal winner from India. Tennis legend Leander Paes ended that wait with his men's singles bronze at Atlanta 1996.It took India 100 years to have a woman win an Olympic medal, a historic feat achieved by weightlifter Karnam Malleswari, who won a bronze at the Sydney Olympics in 2000. She waited 12 years for company in the form of badminton great Saina Nehwal and boxing legend Mary Kom as the next women Olympic medal winners from India. Both won bronze medals at the 2012 London Games.Rifle shooter Abhinav Bindra 's individual gold at Beijing in 2008 was India's first in 108 years of the country's Olympic history at that time. He was joined by javelin-thrower Neeraj Chopra 13 years later with his gold in Tokyo.Hockey had to wait for 41 years, after its 1980 Moscow gold, to return to the Olympic podium. The bronze at the Tokyo Games in 2021 broke that jinx.Neeraj's javelin gold in Tokyo three years ago remains India's first athletics medal post independence.

The hosts were 129/4, needing 9 runs off the last 2 overs when Suryakumar Yadav brought Rinku Singh in the attack.Rinku did a superb job as he conceded just 3 runs and took 2 wickets off the penultimate over, leaving Sri Lanka to get 6 runs off the last over with two new batters at the crease.Due to India's slow over-rate, only four fielders were allowed outside the 30-yard circle and Mohammed Siraj was ready to bowl the last over but SKY made a last minute change and brought himself on to bowl his right-arm off-breaks.After bowling a dot ball, Surya took his maiden T20I wicket when he had Kamindu Mendis caught by Rinku Singh on the second delivery of the over. Surya bowled a slower delivery at 86kph, Mendis went for a reverse-slog but got it off the bottom part of the bat and the ball landed straight into the hands of Rinku Singh at third man.Suryakumar Yadav then had Maheesh Theekshana caught by Sanju Samson down the leg side for a first ball duck. India went for the review and the replays showed that the ball brushed the glove and the same was confirmed by UltraEdge.Asitha Fernando took one run off the hat-trick ball to bring down the equation to 5 runs needed off 2 balls.Chamindu Wickramasinghe took 2 runs off the penultimate ball of the over to bring down the equation to 3 runs needed off 1 ball.

While Suryakumar bowled the 20th over, defending six runs successfully by taking two wickets in his first two balls, Rinku Singh, in a pressure-filled 19th over, bagged two crucial wickets, including that of Kusal Perera, when Sri Lanka needed just nine runs from 12 balls.The two incredible overs from Rinku and Surya stopped the Lankans on 137, taking the game into the Super Over.The Super Over tehn saw Washington Sundar shine, giving away only two runs and taking two wickets.Suryakumar then sealed the win with a sweeping shot on the first ball he faced in the Super Over.No amount of credit is enough for the new India leader Suya, who came into the bowl in the 20th over with six runs to defend and got two wickets in his first two balls.Rinku, bowling for the first time in T20Is, was critical in removing Perera, who scored 46 runs.The Rinku strike came just when Sri Lanka appeared to have the match secured.India were reeling after Khaleel Ahmed's expensive 18th over containing six wides, but Rinku and Suryakumar brought the game back to life.Earlier, when Kusal Mendis (43), Pathum Nissanka (26), and Perera (46) were in cruise control mode with stands of 58 and 52 for the first and second wicket stands, the story looked different. However, just like winning, losing is also a habit and the Islanders have caught that bad bug.For Suryakumar, the series turned out to be a dream affair and he contributed significantly to India's success.His strategic move of introducing Rinku in the 19th over also brought a wide grin on head coach Gautam Gambhir's face.Sri Lankan spinners effectively restrained the Indian batters on a pitch offering significant turn and variable bounce. Despite losing early wickets, India managed to post 137 for 9, with Shubman Gill (39 off 37 balls) and Riyan Parag (26 off 18 balls) stitching a 54-run partnership for the sixth wicket after being down at 48 for 5.Prior to the partnership, India struggled with their shot selection, resulting in the dismissal of key players.Sanju Samson scored his second consecutive duck, getting out to a desperate slog off debutant Chamindu Wickramasinghe.Rinku, struggling to replicate his success from the first season, suffered a momentary lapse, leading to his dismissal. Suryakumar also failed to capitalize, while Shivam Dube couldn't effectively tackle the deliveries that moved away from him.Despite the challenges, Gill adjusted his play style, curbing his natural attacking instincts, and Parag showcased his potential with explosive shots. Highlights of their partnership included Gill's inside-out boundary over covers and Parag's back-to-back sixes off Wanindu Hasaranga.Both, however, fell attempting glory shots.Sri Lanka, meanwhile, missed the services of their premier pacer Matheesha Pathirana due to a shoulder injury.Skipper Charith Asalanka effectively used their four-pronged spin attack, maintaining pressure on Indian batsmen and taking wickets at regular intervals.",India beat Sri Lanka by seven wickets in third and final T20I in Pallekele.

Despite both teams earning numerous penalty corners in the second half, the score remained unchanged.Ireland's profligacy in squandering 10 penalty corner opportunities was a significant factor in their defeat. India's defence, however, also faced criticism for conceding an excessive number of penalty corners in the second half, an area that requires improvement.The Indian team acknowledged their struggles in controlling the ball in the latter stages of the match, allowing Ireland to capitalize on their opportunities. However, they regained control in the final quarter, showcasing their resilience and ability to adapt to the changing dynamics of the game.While India's performance was not flawless, their victory over Ireland has secured their place in the quarterfinals.

"Norman Pritchard: Before Manu Bhaker: Remembering Norman Pritchard, the first ‘Indian’ to win two medals in single Olympic games",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/before-manu-bhaker-remembering-norman-pritchard-the-first-indian-to-win-two-medals-in-single-olympics-games/articleshow/112135371.cms,"Who was Norman Pritchard ?

Calcutta Boy

Football Hero

Hollywood Calling

Manu Bhaker made history as the first Indian athlete , post Independence, to win two medals in the same Olympic Games by securing a bronze medal in the 10m air pistol mixed team event with Sarabjot Singh. Two days earlier, she had claimed India's first medal at the Paris Olympics , becoming the first Indian female shooter to win an Olympic medal.Before that there was another ‘Indian’ who managed that task, even though the history records have a minor quibble over whether he qualified as British or Indian.What is not in dispute is that he won two silver medals at the Paris Games 1900, the same venue where Bhaker made history. He was also the first person to score a hat-trick in an official football match on Indian soil and also the first Olympian to become a star in ‘silent’ Hollywood. And he did it in Paris as well. Of course, pedantic folks could argue that Bhaker won her second medal in a mixed team event while Pritchard won his medals in individual events.Pritchard’s nationality also remained a prickly affair. In 2000, British Olympic historian, the late Ian Buchanan, had claimed that the silver medals Pritchard won (in 200m and 200m hurdles) should be awarded to Great Britain. While it’s true that Pritchard was chosen to represent Great Britain after competing in the British AAA championship, the International Olympic Committee credits India for the medals.Norman Pritchard, born on June 23, 1875, in Calcutta (now Kolkata), India, holds a unique place in the annals of Olympic history . He was the first Indian and Asian-born athlete to win an Olympic medal, achieving this feat at the 1900 Paris Olympics. He was also the first person to score a hat-trick in a professional football game, a founding member of the Indian Football Association and later the first Olympian to participate inPritchard was the son of George Petersen Pritchard, an Englishman who managed a family business in India. He grew up in a well-to-do family, which provided him access to excellent education and opportunities in sports. His athletic talents were nurtured at St. Xavier's College in Calcutta, where he excelled in sprinting and hurdling, quickly gaining recognition in regional athletic meets. His speed and agility were unparalleled at the time, setting the stage for his future successes.In 1900, Pritchard travelled to Paris to compete in the Summer Olympics, a groundbreaking moment as he became the first athlete from India to participate in the Olympics. He competed in the 200 meters, 200 meters hurdles, and 110 meters hurdles. His performance was outstanding; he won silver medals in both the 200 meters and 200 meters hurdles, marking the first time an athlete from India had won Olympic medals. In the 200 meters hurdles, Pritchard set a then Olympic record of 26.8 seconds in the semi-finals, and in the final, he clocked 26 seconds to win silver, behind USA’s Alvin Kraenzlein, who set a new Olympic record.Beyond his Olympic feats, Pritchard also had a notable football career. He is credited with scoring the first hat-trick in an open football tournament in India while playing for St. Xavier's College against Sovabazar in July 1897. He served as the Secretary of the Indian Football Association from 1900 to 1902, contributing significantly to the development of the sport in India.After his Olympic success, Pritchard moved to England and later to the United States, where he transitioned into a career in the entertainment industry. Even how he transitioned to Hollywood is a remarkable story.In December 1906, during a dinner in London, Norman Pritchard was asked to recount the grandeur of the 1899 durbar in Delhi, held to welcome Lord Curzon as the Viceroy of India. His vivid and dramatic description was so compelling that Sir Charles Wyndham, a prominent figure in theatre, mistook him for an actor and invited him to play a minor role in ""The Stronger Sex"" at the Apollo Theatre in 1907.Pritchard's performance was successful, prompting Sir Charles to encourage him to pursue acting seriously. Pritchard made his Broadway debut in the United States with ""The Elder Son"" at the Playhouse Theatre on September 15, 1914. In 1919, he played a significant role in a strike action at the Schubert Theater in Washington, leading a boycott as a member of the trade union, The Equity, to demand better wages for actors.Adopting the stage name Norman Trevor, he found a niche in Hollywood as a character actor. He appeared in numerous films and Broadway productions, gaining moderate success. His Broadway debut came with ""The Elder Son"" at the Playhouse Theatre in 1914. He went on to act in 26 plays and 27 movies, making his big screen debut in silent movies with ""After Dark"" in 1915 and ending with ""Tonight at Twelve,"" released in 1929, the year of his death.Pritchard passed away on October 31, 1929, in Norwalk, California, under tragic circumstances. His obituary stated that he died of a ""brain malady,"" and it is now speculated that he may have been suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Despite his relatively early death, his legacy endures, particularly in India, where he is celebrated as a pioneer in athletics. His accomplishments paved the way for future generations of Indian athletes, inspiring them to compete on the world stage.","Norman Pritchard was the first Indian and Asian-born athlete to win an Olympic medal, achieving this feat at the 1900 Paris Olympics.

With a total of 20.5, the Koreans won the first round and took a 2-0 lead.The team with the most points—16—wins the medal in mixed team competitions.At a deficit of 0–2, Bhaker's reliability was evident, and Sarabjot benefited from it as they won the following four games to increase their lead to 8–2.Bhaker was so confident that during the entire 13-round competition, she only had three shots below ten.The Koreans faced an uphill battle as they gave in to pressure and lost 16–10, unable to equal their opponents.At 13 years of age, Sarabjot harboured hopes of becoming a footballer but while studying at Ambala's Bhagirath Public School, he saw a few kids wielding air guns at a makeshift range during a summer camp and went to his father and told him that he wants to pursue shooting.That was 2014. Sarbjot's father Jitender Singh , a farmer, told his son that the sport is pretty expensive. But eventually, after Sarabjot insisted for months, he agreed.It's a decision that the family will never repent, especially after what Sarabjot has achieved in the international circuit.Sarabjot has already won a senior ISSF World Cup gold in 10m air pistol.In the domestic circuit, his precision and calmness has made him the national champion twice.As of now, Sarabjot has won 2 World Championships gold medals, 3 World Cup gold medals, 1 ISSF Junior World Cup gold, 1 gold and 2 silver medals in ISSF Junior Cup and 2 gold medals, a sliver and a bronze in the Asian Championships.Sarabjot has always credited his coach Abhishek Rana for making a champion out of him.","Sarabjot Singh won India's second medal with Manu Bhaker at Paris Olympics.

NEW DELHI: When Hardik Pandya returned after India's ICC T20 World Cup 2024 triumph, he didn't anticipate losing his T20 captaincy to Suryakumar Yadav . Suryakumar was chosen as India's T20I captain for the series against Sri Lanka, as chief selector Ajit Agarkar sought someone ""likely to be available more often.""Pandya, who was Rohit Sharma 's deputy during India's recent T20 World Cup triumph, has faced fitness issues, including an ankle injury during last year's 50-over World Cup.Despite his strong performance in the T20 World Cup—scoring 144 runs in six innings at an average of 48.00 and a strike rate of 151.57, along with 11 wickets in eight games at an average of 17.36 and an economy rate of 7.64—Pandya was removed from the leadership role and not included in the ODI squad.Former India pacer Ashish Nehra described the decision as a 'surprise.'""It is a decision of the coach and selection committee. It came as a big surprise, obviously. It can be because he is not that fit, he doesn't play many matches, he plays just one format - this can be one of the reasons. But Hardik Pandya is a very important player in the Indian setup when you talk about white-ball cricket and when he is fit,"" Nehra told TimesofIndia.com in an interview.Suryakumar and Gambhir share a strong bond dating back to their days with Kolkata Knight Riders in 2014. Gambhir, who was the KKR captain, showed significant faith in Suryakumar, even making him the vice-captain at one point.Is Gambhir viewing Suryakumar, who made a crucial catch in the T20 World Cup final, as a long-term T20I captaincy prospect?""I am not sure whether he is a long-term or short-term prospect. It all depends on his captaincy, form, and most importantly, his equation with the coach and the selection committee. He is a captain in T20Is,"" Nehra said.""The main captain is Rohit Sharma, and Shubman Gill has been announced as his deputy. If you look at T20Is, India will play 5 or 6 T20Is this year. Surya has been part of the Indian side for a while. Rohit is there in the Indian side and will be leading in the other two formats - ODIs and Tests. Virat is there too. After winning the World Cup, this is a good transition in the Indian team. You have a lot of replacements,"" he added.""Surya played at KKR when GG was there. So, it's not like a new coach has come in and Surya has become a new skipper. It's because they know each other well. GG knows Surya's capabilities and strengths as a player and captain. If we see other countries, they have had three different captains or two different captains for a long time. I am sure captain Surya will do well under coach GG,"" Nehra concluded.","Suryakumar Yadav named India's T20 captain for series against Sri Lanka.

NEW DELHI: India, under the guidance of new coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Suryakumar Yadav , will aim to capitalize on Sri Lanka's vulnerabilities and secure a series sweep in the third and final T20I on Tuesday. The series outcome has already been determined, with India dominating the first two matches, leaving Sri Lanka facing the prospect of a humiliating whitewash.In the second T20I, India secured a seven-wicket victory in a rain-affected match, once again thwarting Sri Lanka's efforts. The hosts' promising start was undermined by subpar batting, a recurring issue throughout the series.India has consistently demonstrated their superiority, exhibiting greater confidence in their strategies, skills, and execution, and remaining composed under pressure. Despite moments when Sri Lanka appeared to be gaining the upper hand, India has consistently found a way to regain control, particularly through their effective bowling.Suryakumar, the bowlers' captain, has not only skill fully directed his team with precise bowling changes but has also led by example with the bat, scoring 58 and 26 in the two matches so far.The availability of vice-captain and opener Shubman Gill for the third match remains uncertain due to a stiff neck that caused him to miss the second game. His replacement, Sanju Samson, had limited opportunities in the rain-affected match and will be looking to make a stronger impact.For Sri Lanka, Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Perera have provided strong starts, but the team's struggles in the middle overs have been their downfall. India spinner Ravi Bishnoi, who played a key role in the second game with figures of 3/26, emphasized the Sri Lankan batters' difficulties in navigating spin bowling throughout the series.- Date: July 30- Time: 7:00 PM IST- Venue: Pallekele Stadium, Kandy- Total Matches: 31- India Wins: 21- Sri Lanka Wins: 9The Pallekele Stadium pitch has been favorable for batters, providing good pace and bounce, especially in the early overs. The first two matches showcased batters enjoying playing their strokes. However, the pitch has also offered assistance to spinners, particularly in the second innings, with increased turn. Given this is the third consecutive match at this venue, the pitch might slow down a bit, offering more help to spinners.- Matches Played: 2- Matches Won Batting First: 1- Matches Won Batting Second: 1- Batters: The top-order batters have thrived on the new, hard ball. They are likely to be the most rewarding picks for fantasy contests.- Bowlers: Spinners can exploit the pitch conditions throughout the game. Pacers who can vary their pace and deliver accurate yorkers will also be valuable.- Suryakumar Yadav: The new Indian T20 captain is in excellent form, carrying great momentum into this game.- Arshdeep Singh: The left-arm pacer has been consistent, particularly effective in the death overs, making him a valuable pick for points.- Pathum Nissanka: The opener is the highest run-scorer in the series and the most consistent batter in the Sri Lankan line-up.- Matheesha Pathirana: The pacer has been the most effective bowler for Sri Lanka, consistently picking up crucial wickets.Suryakumar Yadav (c), Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rinku Singh , Riyan Parag, Rishabh Pant (wk), Sanju Samson (wk), Hardik Pandya , Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Ravi Bishnoi, Arshdeep Singh, Khaleel Ahmed, Mohammed Siraj.Dinesh Chandimal, Avishka Fernando, Kusal Mendis (wk), Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Perera, Charith Asalanka (c), Wanindu Hasaranga, Kamindu Mendis, Dasun Shanaka, Chamindu Wickramasinghe, Binura Fernando, Asitha Fernando, Dilshan Madushanka, Matheesha Pathirana, Maheesh Theekshana, Dunith Welalage.Wicketkeeper: Kusal PereraBatters: Suryakumar Yadav, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Pathum NissankaAll-rounders: Hardik Pandya, Riyan Parag, Dasun ShanakaBowlers: Arshdeep Singh, Ravi Bishnoi, Maheesh Theekshana, Matheesha PathiranaThis match promises to be an exciting contest with India looking to extend their dominance and Sri Lanka aiming to leverage their home advantage.

But to everyone's surprise, he is no mood to throw the ball back into the ground. Not just that, he expresses his anger at the players as if saying that he has had enough of the ball coming to him and he won't return it this time and then nonchalantly walks away with the ball, still shouting angrily towards the ground.Later the man is also shown relaxing on a 'charpoy' as if nothing had happened.As far as the match is concerned, Siechem Madurai Panthers beat Chepauk Super Gillies by 9 runs.","The incident happened during the Tamil Nadu Premier League 2024 clash between Chepauk Super Gillies and Siechem Madurai Panthers.

Having controlled Madih Talal's delightful chip while beating an offside trap, David saw goalkeeper Subhajit Basu come out of line and coolly lobbed the ball over him.Cuadrat introduced Diamantakos and PV Vishnu in the second half and the Greek forward rose to the occasion in the 61st minute to make his debut special, meeting Mark Zo's cross from left and beating the goalkeeper in the air with a perfect header.Six minutes later, Saul Crespo sealed the deal. A link-up play with Diamantakos allowed Crespo to receive the ball on the edge of the box. With a half-turn the Spaniard left his challenger Arashpreet Singh searching for an answer and then beat the goalkeeper with a low shot which hit the inside of the post before going in.Both Mohun Bagan SG and East Bengal have started their campaign on a winning note but Cuadrat's side is leading Group A because of a better goal difference.Six group winners and two second-best teams would progress to the quarterfinals.","Dimitrios Diamantakos scored on his debut in East Bengal FC jersey as Carles Cuadrat's team began their Durand Cup campaign with a 3-1 win over Indian Air Force FT.

They collected just 21 points from 22 games and lost as many as 11 games.Speaking ahead of the game, Jamil said, “We’re on home turf, but that’s no excuse to take things lightly. We must approach this game with utmost seriousness and respect for our opponents. A good start is crucial, and every single player and staff member is focused and geared up for this match. We can’t afford to underestimate them — it’s time to put in the work and make our home advantage count.”The team has been putting in the hours and began their preparation midway into July. Jamil has also made numerous signings after penning a 2-year contract extension with the club. This week itself they have announced the recruitment of Javi Hernandez and Stephen Eze among the foreigners and Aniket Jadhav, Shubham Sarangi and Ashutosh Mehta among the Indians.Although Jamil has made it aptly clear that Assam Rifles are not to be taken lightly, it’s their second game against Chennaiyin that will test them to the fullest.Like JFC, the Marina Machans have also bolstered their squad with a number of signings and will be looking to put it past the hosts. The match will also see Own Coyle making a comeback to the city where he holds a special positon in the hearts of the JFC fans after he guided them to their only Shield win three seasons back.Meanwhile, a grand opening ceremony will be held at JRD Tata Sports Complex earlier in the afternoon. Besides cultural activities, the Indian Army has planned to hold fly pass by helicopters, sky diving by paratroopers from the Akash Ganga Team of Indian Air Force and a fixed wing aircraft fly pass.","Jamshedpur FC will begin their Durand Cup campaign against Assam Rifles FT on Sunday.

Panaji:

Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa ’s Manolo Marquez , who will now do a dual job of coaching club and country.Habas remains the most successful coach in the Indian Super League (ISL), the top-tier league in the country, and believed he had more than a decent chance of stepping into the boots of Igor Stimac, sacked last month for his failure to steer India to the third round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers.“I think I deserved the nomination (to coach the national team),” Habas told TOI after completing a surprise move to Inter Kashi in the I-League , Indian football’s second tier, on Thursday. “We won three (ISL) titles, played four finals and six semifinals. Within football (fraternity), I feel like another Indian. I have coached many players of the national team. I was not chosen, and I accept it. I will support the national team by developing players at Inter Kashi. It’s what I have done until now, and what I will continue to do.”Last season, Habas guided Mohun Bagan Super Giant to the ISL Shield triumph. But while title victories normally assure coaches of a contract extension, the experienced Spaniard was not considered, reportedly due to concerns over his health. Even while selecting the national coach, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) executive committee members made a mention of the 67-year-old’s age and health.Habas though said he has the same “strength and enthusiasm” as when he first arrived in India to take charge of Atletico de Kolkata and won the maiden ISL trophy in 2014.“I am very disappointed and saddened by the treatment that some journalists and others have given me, speaking about my health problems. Someone did it to justify my departure from Mohun Bagan, and at the same time, prevent me from training the national team. My medical tests are currently perfect,” said Habas.The serial trophy winner has won the ISL twice with ATK (2014, 2019-20) and the ISL Winner’s Shield with Mohun Bagan last season. Now, his focus is on ensuring that Inter Kashi – started last season – win the I-League and move to the ISL.Explaining his decision to take over Inter Kashi, Habas said the club’s “proposal is attractive, serious and ambitious.”“It offers me guarantees and seriousness to develop my work,” he said. “At the same time, it is a great responsibility to be able to have a great impact sportingly in such an important and fascinating region of India as Uttar Pradesh.”Besides winning trophies in India, Habas had a stint as Bolivia’s head coach and finished runner-up in the 1997 Copa America.Inter Kashi said Habas will spearhead a long-term project aimed at creating a sustainable football ecosystem in Uttar Pradesh. “This initiative will focus on the promotion of Inter Kashi to the ISL, ensuring the club competes at the highest level of Indian football.“Habas will also help Inter Kashi devise a concrete player pathway to Europe, collaborating with Inter Escaldes to establish a pathway for Indian players to gain opportunities in Andorra, providing them with invaluable international exposure and experience,” the club said in a statement on Thursday.","Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa’s Manolo Marquez.

"Opted to play Durand Cup with reserves, club wanted 6-week pre-season for first team: Chennaiyin assistant coach Noel Wilson",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/opted-to-play-durand-cup-with-reserves-club-wanted-6-week-pre-season-for-first-team-chennaiyin-assistant-coach-noel-wilson/articleshow/112019717.cms,"What was the reason behind fielding the reserve team for the Durand Cup?

Five first-team players – Samik Mitra, Bikash Yumnam, Vincy Barretto, Alexander Romario and Irfan Yadwad – have been included in the camp. What is the plan for them?

What do you make of the youngsters in the squad?

How has the preparation been so far?

Coyle is well known for his positive brand of football. Will the reserve team have a similar style of play going forward?

You have reunited with Coyle, after having worked at Jamshedpur FC. How does it feel?

CHENNAI: Chennaiyin FC ’s newly appointed assistant coach Noel Wilson said the club opted to play with the reserve team in the Durand Cup to ensure that the first-team gets a six-week pre-season ahead of the Indian Super League (ISL). In an interaction with TOI at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium – Chennaiyin’s current training base – Wilson spoke about head coach Owen Coyle’s plan for the main team, Durand Cup preparation and more.Excerpts:You (first team) need to have a six-week pre-season (ahead of the ISL), which is about one-and-a-half months. I think, after the Durand Cup, there is going to be a gap of two months. You cannot be stagnant in that period. Coyle will have better ideas. He does not want the main team to play in the Durand Cup as there are chances of players getting injured. Maybe he does not want to take risk with the main-team players. He knows what is right.The players who have come here did not get much game time last season. When you play competitive matches, your confidence level will increase. After playing here, they will perform better once they return to the main team.There are some young players who have good quality. They need the experience and exposure of playing with the bigger guys (seniors). The difference between playing in a reserve team and a senior team is huge. But I can see that there is potential.Besides players from the main and reserve teams, we have shortlisted a few players from the trials. The team is good; the young boys are working hard. No matter what the team is (opponent), you will win if you play well. That is what I believe in. I have asked the boys not to worry about the opponents, whether they are from the ISL or I-League.It is difficult to implement a style of play when you have only a month to prepare. We began training at the start of the month and our first match is on July 31. But in general, I like it when the boys keep the ball in the front (attacking areas). I do not want the boys to keep the ball at the back for a long time. I do not want them to do that because it might create problems; errors at the back could lead to goals. I would rather expect the players to take the ball forward and play in the opponent’s half. That will be safer for us.Coyle is a wonderful coach; we can see it in his personality and coaching. Last season, he got Chennaiyin to the playoffs. It is always good to work with good coaches. As an Indian coach, we always try to learn something which will help us in the future.",Chennaiyin FC will play with the reserve team in the Durand Cup to ensure the first-team gets a six-week pre-season ahead of the Indian Super League (ISL) Assistant coach Noel Wilson spoke about head coach Owen Coyle’s plan for the main team.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112019695,imgsize-827309,width-400,resizemode-4/112019695.jpg"
