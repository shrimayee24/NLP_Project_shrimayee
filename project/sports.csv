Gautam Gambhir faces setback as BCCI rejects his recommendations for support staff: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/gautam-gambhir-faces-setback-as-bcci-rejects-his-recommendations-for-support-staff-report/articleshow/111674262.cms,"NEW DELHI: Before officially stepping into his role as India’s head coach , Gautam Gambhir encountered a minor setback. Reports indicate that Gambhir’s recommendation for Jonty Rhodes as the fielding coach has been turned down by the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ).Gambhir, who has recently been appointed as India’s head coach, had proposed the name of Jonty Rhodes, widely regarded as one of the best fielders to have ever played the game.Rhodes had previously worked with Gambhir at Lucknow Super Giants, where Gambhir was a mentor. However, the BCCI remains steadfast in its policy of maintaining an all-Indian support staff for the national team, a practice that has been in place for the past seven years.According to a report by the Hindustan Times, the BCCI is not inclined to hire foreign personnel for the support staff. This decision comes as India transitions to a new coaching regime following the completion of the tenures of previous head coach Rahul Dravid and his support staff, which included batting coach Vikram Rathour, bowling coach Paras Mhambrey, and fielding coach T Dilip, post the T20 World Cup.As per the same HT report, Gambhir’s proposal for R Vinay Kumar as the bowling coach was also reportedly not supported by the board.Additionally, there were earlier reports from Cricbuzz about Gambhir advocating for the inclusion of former Netherlands international Ryan ten Doeschate in his support staff. Ten Doeschate, who served as the fielding coach for Kolkata Knight Riders, is also involved with the franchise’s teams in the Caribbean Premier League and Major League Cricket.Despite these recommendations, the BCCI has made it clear that the final decision on the composition of the support staff rests solely with them. Gambhir’s setback indicates the board’s commitment to maintaining its current strategy and structure for the Indian cricket team’s support personnel.The cricketing community now awaits the BCCI's final decision on the support staff that will work alongside Gambhir as he embarks on his new journey as India’s head coach.",Gautam Gambhir's recommendation for Jonty Rhodes as fielding coach turned down.

India's new head coach Gautam Gambhir wants Ryan ten Doeschate in support staff: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/indias-new-head-coach-gautam-gambhir-wants-ryan-ten-doeschate-in-support-staff-report/articleshow/111651202.cms,"The BCCI has lately advocated for Indian coaches in the setup, but Team India's new head coach Gautam Gambhir has reportedly asked for a slight deviation in the form of including former Netherlands international Ryan ten Doeschate as part of his support staff, according to Cricbuzz.The final decision, however, rests with the Indian board.Doeschate has always been openly backed by Gambhir as a thorough professional committed to team's objectives.The Dutchman was also one of Gambhir's assistants during the former India opener's role as mentor of Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) during the team's triumph in the 2024 season of the Indian Premier League.Doeschate was KKR's fielding coach and is also part of the teams that the franchise owns in the Caribbean Premier League and Major League Cricket.According to the Cricbuzz report, the BCCI is already discussing ten Doeschate's name but the board wants T Dilip to continue in his role as the fielding coach. In that scenario, the Dutchman could be considered for a different role. Notably, another member of Gambhir's coaching staff in KKR, Abhishek Nayar, is being considered for the role of India's assistant coach.Nayar was the batting coach for KKR in IPL 2024.If Gambhir and BCCI manage to rope in both Nayar and Doeschate, it will leave a major void in KKR's coaching setup.Gambhir replaced Rahul Dravid as India's head coach last week. Dravid's tenure ended with the T20 World Cup, which India won last month to end an 11-year wait for another ICC trophy.","Gautam Gambhir has reportedly asked for Ryan ten Doeschate to be part of his support staff.

Pakistan thwarted Windies' comeback

Archrivals India and Pakistan will meet in the final of the World Championship of Legends after the two teams won their respective semi-final on Friday at Northampton .While Pakistan defeated West Indies in the first semifinal by 20 runs, India triumphed over Australia in the second match of the last-four stage with a massive 86-run victory.The final is scheduled for Saturday at Birmingham, beginning 9:30 pm IST.Batting first, India's middle order was set up by opener Robin Uthappa's fiery 65 off 35 balls, which included 4 sixes and 6 fours.Despite Ambati Rayudu (14) and Suresh Raina (5) falling cheaply, Uthappa never lifted his foot off the accelerator as an equally dominant Yuvraj Singh joined him for a 47-run partnership for the third wicket.Spinner Xavier Doherty struck a vital blow for Australia by removing the dangerous Uthappa, but there was no let-up in India's intent to score quickly.Yuvraj and Yusuf Pathan then smashed 54 runs in just four overs to take the attack to the Aussies before Yuvraj was cleaned up by Peter Siddle for 59 off 28 balls. The flamboyant left-hander hit 5 sixes and 4 fours.The game then witnessed a show put up by Pathan brothers, with Irfan joining his elder brother Yusuf. In India's last match, the duo got separated after a mix-up, which led to Irfan's run-out and left him fuming. But there was no such hiccup on Saturday. Instead, the brothers fired in unison.In 5.4 overs, the Pathan brothers smashed 95 runs to send the Aussie bowlers to the cleaners, with Irfan being the more dominant of the duo, scoring 50 off just 19 balls.Irfan was cleaned up by Siddle in the final over of India's innings, but by then Yusuf, who remained not out for 51 off 23 balls, and India's three other half-centurions had done enough damage to take the total to a gigantic 254 for 6 despite paceman Siddle's effort of 4 for 57, while Brett Lee went for 60 runs in his four overs and remained wicketless.Australia needed a big start from their openers Shaun Marsh (2) and Aaron Finch (16), but their top three, including Ben Dunk (10), were sent back inside the Powerplay to leave the big run-chase at a precarious 42 for 3.But the procession of the Australian batsmen didn't stop until Tim Paine (40 not out off 32 balls) and Nathan Coulter-Nile, who made quickfire 30 off 13 balls, tried to launch a fight. However, it was to no avail as the Aussie chase ended at 168 for 7.Indian bowlers shared the spoils. Pawan Negi led the attack with his 2 for 35, with Dhawal Kulakarni (2 for 43) also striking twice. Rahul Shukla (1 for 25) , Harbhajan Singh (1 for 16) and Irfan (1 for 18) took one wicket apiece.Pakistan had to thank their captain Younis Khan and opener Kamran Akmal for their 79-run stand for the fourth wicket after a top-order collapse.Batting first, Sharjeel Khan (0), Sohaib Maqsood (1) and Shoaib Malik (0) departed cheaply to leave Pakistan struggling at 10 for 3. But Akmal held one end up before getting out for a counter-attacking 46 off 31 balls.Younis too didn't let the loose balls go unpunished but saw two fellow former Pakistan captains Shahid Afridi (1) and Misbah-ul-Haq (o) walking back to the pavilion in quick succession.It was then left to Younis to once again steady the ship and he found able support from Aamer Yamin lower down the order as the duo added crucial 34 runs before Younis fell for a 45-ball 65 to pacer Fidel Edwards, who was the pick of the West Indies bowling with figures of 3 for 24.Left-arm spinner Sulieman Benn also bowled appreciably, claiming 2 wickets of 26 runs.But the Windies bowling came in for some punishment from tailenders Yamin and Sohail Tanvir as both used the long handle to good effect in a quickfire 61-run partnership for the 8th wicket.Yamin remained not out at 40 off 18 balls, while Tanvir smased 33 off 17 to lead their team to a healthy total of 198 for 8.In chase, West Indies top order of Dwayne Smith, Chris Gayle and Chadwick Walton failed to get going despite getting their eye in and departed for 26, 22 and 19 respectively.Sohaib Maqsood (4 for 21) struck twice with the new ball to check the Windies and their run-rate, which never took off.Ashley Nurse (36 off 24) then held the middle order for a while but was run out by Akmal as Jason Mohammed (7) and captain Darren Sammy (10) also departed without contributing much.Rayad Emrit played a cameo of 29 off 9 balls, but it was in vain as the Windies' innings folded up for 178 in 19.5 overs.Wahab Riaz (2 for 35) and Malik (2 for 26) were the other wicket-takers for Pakistan.","India and Pakistan will meet in the final of the World Championship of Legends.

'Overconfident ho ke hi kaam kharab hua': Misbah-ul-Haq relives the agony of Pakistan's 2007 T20 World Cup final defeat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/overconfident-ho-ke-hi-kaam-kharab-hua-misbah-ul-haq-relives-the-agony-of-pakistans-2007-t20-world-cup-final-defeat/articleshow/111679717.cms,"WATCH VIDEO

The pain of failing to take Pakistan over the line against India in the 2007 T20 World Cup final is still evident in Misbah-ul-Haq 's voice. Pakistan's captain at that time, Misbah took his team to the brink of victory, only to fall closer to the finish line.Played at the Wanderers in Johannesburg on Septmber 24, 2007, the short side boundaries gave Misbah the confidence that they can chase down India's 157 for 5 to win the trophy.Gautam Gambhir (75 off 54 balls) and Rohit Sharma (30 off 16 balls) helped India put up a respectable total on the board, after Umra Gul's 3 for 28 led Pakistan's bowling effort.""We were very confident because the kind of pitch there was and the kind of (short) boundaries, it was very tough for India because they were dependent on their spin bowling,"" said Misbah on a Star Sports show.""At the Wanderers, it's very difficult for the spinners usually and their main bowler at that time was Harbhajan Singh. For an offspinner to bowl with short side boundaries there (was tough), and usually we play spin well,"" he added.Pakistan's run-chase didn't begin on a strong note as RP Singh struck early blows to peg them back at 26 for 2, but it was the run-out of dangerous opener Imran Nazir (33 off 14 balls) that actually put pressure back on Pakistan.""We thought ke ye to koi mushkil runs nahi hain (not a difficult target to chase), just need a good start. But I think losing quick wickets in 2-3 overs, the run-out of Imran Nazir, that basically put pressure on us. At one point we were 77 for 6. So because of the fall of wickets, the target became difficult,"" Misbah analysed.But two little partnership of 27 and 34 runs between Misbah and Yasir Arafat & Misbah and Sohail Tanvir put Pakistan within sight of victory.""Mujhe lagta hai overconfident ho ke hi kaam kharab hua (I think things went bad because of overconfidence),"" Misbah added.Pakistan needed 13 runs to win when India captain MS Dhoni handed over the ball to Joginder Sharma .""I was very confident that we need 13 runs and I have to middle only two balls. The four to third-man boundary off an edge from (Mohammad) Asif's bat gave us a feeling that maybe luck is on our side. Then I hit a six at the start of the last over,"" recalled the former Pakistan captain.But off the third ball of the over, Misbah tried a high-risk scoop shot over fine-leg, and it landed into the hands of S Sreesanth to signal India's famous five-run win.""It is like that, cricket is like that. When you have just one wicket left, then the bowling side is ahead in the game because you have to make just one mistake, out, and game over,"" he concluded.","Pakistan lost to India in the 2007 T20 World Cup final in Johannesburg.

Pakistan's run-chase didn't begin on a strong note as RP Singh struck early blows.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111679776,imgsize-77016,width-400,resizemode-4/111679776.jpg"

5. VS The Rock at SummerSlam 2002

Brock Lesnar has been one of the greatest performers, and one of the most feared men in a fight irrespective of an Octagon or a ring across the globe. Here are five best matches of the Beast Incarnate in WWE Two of the scariest men in the ring and in the history of WWE, The Undertaker and Brock Lesnar went toe to toe in a WWE championship match at Unforgiven, which resulted in a no contest after the referee was attacked by both the giants.Then, it was decided by SmackDown GM, Stephanie McMahon that Lesnar will defend his title against Undertaker in a rematch at No Mercy, this time in a menacing Hell in a Cell match. During the match, Lesnar was attacked by Taker using his caste, causing Lesnar to bleed, but due to Lesnar focusing on the Undertaker’s broken hand, Brock attained an upper hand, and eventually beat The Phenom in a dominating manner. This was a monumental victory for a guy as young as Brock Lesnar was at that time.Arguably one of the best in-ring performers and one of the toughest rivals of Brock Lesnar, Kurt Angle always gave a tough time to the beast. Brock Lesnar, after winning the Royal Rumble in 2002, challenged Angle for the WWE championship at Wrestlemania 2002. In the main event of Wrestlemania, Angle defended his WWE championship against Lesnar, and even if Kurt was disqualified, he would lose the title. Lesnar dished out 3 F5’s to Kurt and eventually pinned him successfully to win the WWE championship and his first Wrestlemania match. What was beautiful to see was that Angle shook Lesnar’s hand at the end of the match.The Beast Incarnate had won the WWE Universal championship at last year’s Wrestlemania and retained his title throughout that year. Roman Reigns won the Elimination Chamber match right before Wrestlemania 34 to challenge Lesnar in a rematch of Wrestlemania 31(which was interrupted by Seth Rollins’ Money in the Bank cash in). In the main event, Brock successfully defended his Universal championship against Reigns. He delivered a brutal total of six F5’s to Roman and left him in a pile of his own blood to retain his championship in a dominating fashion. It was one of the most vicious beatdowns delivered to the future ‘Head of the Table’.When Brock Lesnar came back to WWE, his first target was John Cena. Although in the first meeting after Brock came back, Cena defeated Lesnar at Extreme Rules 2012. But in the next encounter between the two, for the unified WWE World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam 2014, Lesnar delivered a beating of a lifetime to Cena and won the World Championship.It was a brutal display of the sheer dominance by Brock Lesnar in the WWE.Looking to make a splash, in the biggest match of his career till then, Brock challenged The Rock for the WWE Undisputed title at SummerSlam 2002 and shocked the world by beating him in a dominant fashion. The Beast Incarnate won the match after dishing out his signature F5 to the Brahma Bull and pinning him to win the title. In a way, this victory announced the arrival of Brock in the main event scene.","Brock Lesnar is one of the most feared men in the WWE. Lesnar has won the WWE championship five times. The Beast Incarnate has beaten The Undertaker, Kurt Angle and John Cena. He won the unified WWE World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111680521,imgsize-50986,width-400,resizemode-4/111680521.jpg"

"Memories of another day: Revisiting James Anderson's battles with Virat Kohli, Sachin Tendulkar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/memories-of-another-day-revisiting-james-andersons-battles-with-virat-kohli-sachin-tendulkar/articleshow/111702940.cms,"The retiring England pace great had some memorable duels with India's star batters during his long career

CHENNAI: ""Let me know if you want to become a part of our support-staff."" As the curtain fell on the career of one of the greatest of all time, the unique job offer from James Anderson made six years ago came to mind.It was the summer of 2018 and Anderson was suddenly hit by a force that hadn't really bothered him till then.Virat Kohli had discovered a way to deal with the legendary English paceman and Anderson, then 35, was caught off-guard. After the immense struggles of 2014, when Anderson had got Kohli four times for virtually nothing, the Indian master had come to England with a plan.Kohli threw the age-old formula of playing late against English swing bowlers out of the window and decided to take guard outside the crease against Anderson and his pace partner Stuart Broad . The then Indian captain decided that he would play the Anderson delivery before it breaks for the swing, turning the duel into one of the most riveting contests that you can ever witness.In the first Test in Birmingham on a mighty difficult track, Kohli got a magnificent century in the first innings by taking on Anderson. Yes, he offered a couple of difficult chances which weren't grabbed, but that's par for the course. It was an innings of incredible quality and when Anderson was bombarded with questions on Kohli by the Indian journalists, the English pacer looked slightly annoyed. When TOI asked him whether he would look to bowl slightly short to counter Kohli's new method of taking guard outside the crease, the unique job offer (with a hint of irritation) mentioned above came about.After the complete one-sided nature of the 2014 series when Anderson ruled over Kohli, the Englishman couldn't get the Indian great out once in the 2018 series. England won the series 4-1, Anderson had his moments in the sun, but this became one of the most iconic battles ever. The English pacer, who bowled in international cricket for the last time in Lord's on Friday, had to wait for three more years to get Kohli's scalp twice in 2021, but by then the honours had been shared.Anderson had Kohli seven times in 25 Tests that they played against each other, but the Englishman has a far better record against Sachin Tendulkar . The king of swing got the Little Master nine times in the 14 games that they played, yet Anderson feels ""Sachin is the batter I have ever bowled to"".The statement seems slightly contradictory because of the success-rate, but it probably boils down to the fact that Anderson couldn't make Tendulkar change his game. The man with 51 Test hundreds remained the same player, going about his business in the classical way of playing it late, as he won and lost in equal measure against the best swing bowler of the 21st century.Sachin and Anderson had some fascinating battles over the years, but the one that probably stands out is one of their latter duels at Eden Gardens in 2012. The series was 1-1 at that stage and on a murky Kolkata day, Tendulkar batted brilliantly in the first two sessions, dealing with the swing of Anderson in his beautiful, old-fashioned way.It was in the third session that Anderson made one to swing as late as possible that kissed the outside edge of Sachin's bat and the catch was completed by the keeper. Our hearts broke, the match swung, the series turned, but over time we were left to cherish those memories that still makes cricket a beautiful game.","James Anderson bowled in international cricket for the last time in Lord's on Friday.

Novak Djokovic goes past Lorenzo Musetti to set up Wimbledon final against Carlos Alcaraz,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon/novak-djokovic-goes-past-lorenzo-musetti-to-set-up-wimbledon-final-against-carlos-alcaraz/articleshow/111702298.cms,"Novak Djokovic , a seven-time Wimbledon champion, showcased his exceptional skills on the court, defeating Italy's Lorenzo Musetti , the 25th seed, in straight sets. The Serbian maestro secured a 6-4, 7-6(2), 6-4 victory, earning him a spot in his 10th Wimbledon final.In the championship match, Djokovic will face the defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz , setting the stage for an exciting rematch of their 2023 encounter.This marks the first time since 2014-15, when Djokovic and his longtime rival Roger Federer competed in consecutive finals, that the same two players will battle in the title match in back-to-back years.""I've said it many times, Wimbledon has been a childhood dream for me to play and to win... I was a seven-year-old boy watching bombs fly over my head and dreaming of being on the most important court in the world,"" Djokovic told the Centre Court crowd, as reported by Reuters.""I was constructing Wimbledon trophies out of any material in the room. It has been an incredible journey. I try not to take it for granted every time I find myself on this unique court.""Obviously, during the match, it's business time and... I try outplay my opponent. I'm satisfied and pleased, but I don't want to stop here. Hopefully I get my hands on the trophy.""Djokovic, the second seed, secured a break in the sixth game of the first set, following an intense 27-shot rally.This was shortly after Alcaraz's hard-fought 6-7(1), 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 triumph over fifth seed Daniil Medvedev, while spectators were still arriving at the Centre Court.Despite having expressed frustration with the crowd after his fourth-round victory against Holger Rune on Monday, the 37-year-old Djokovic encouraged more support from the audience, even though his actions elicited some boos.The fans rallied behind Musetti, who responded by breaking back to make it 4-5 with a powerful forehand. However, the 22-year-old Italian's shaky service game ultimately cost him the set.In the second set, Musetti quickly regained his composure and made progress, executing a stunning backhand pass to take a 3-1 lead. Djokovic, however, remained unfazed as he fought his way back into the set. The Serbian elevated his performance significantly towards the end, securing the tiebreak and further solidifying his position in the match.Djokovic showcased his versatility by employing serve-and-volley tactics, putting Musetti under immense pressure. Despite a late resurgence from the Italian, who managed to earn a break point, Djokovic held his nerve and clinched the match on his fourth match point when Musetti's shot sailed long.After securing the victory, he performed his signature celebration, pretending to play the violin with his racquet. This was for his daughter, who was watching from the stands and is currently learning to play the violin herself. However, his actions were met with increased jeers from the spectator.Djokovic remains undeterred by the crowd's reaction, as his focus lies on securing a record-equalling eighth Wimbledon title, a remarkable feat considering he underwent knee surgery just five weeks prior to the tournament.""I came to London eight days before the tournament started. I didn't know (if I would play). I was keeping everything open until the day of the draw,"" Djokovic said.""I played a couple of practice sets with top players and that proved to me I was in good enough state to not just be in Wimbledon, but to go deep into the tournament. That kind of mentality is there and is ever present.

TOI takes a look at the players who made heads turn on the Euro stage this summer:Youngest to score in a Euro. Youngest to win a MoM in a Euro. Yamal's bucket is overflowing with 'youngest' records. His goal against France, curled from outside the box, will be talked about alongside the goals of Marco Van Basten and Paul Gascoigne.His skills are outrageous, and his maturity (at 16 years and 362 days) belies reason. At no stage in has Yamal showed any sign of nerves. His exploits in La Liga for Barca had made waves, and Yamal made this Euro his graduation ceremony. As Xavi says, ""He will mark an era.""Not an unknown quantity. It is Musiala's second Euro. In between, he has represented Germany in the Qatar World Cup too. He lit up this Euro after scoring three times in the first four games.Germany manager Julian Nagelsmann says the ""brilliant"" Musiala must keep playing ""like he is on a small pitch in Germany or England with his friends"". With the German old guard taking a bow after their quarterfinal exit, it's time for Musiala to carry the torch ahead for Die Mannschaft.The La Liga season was nearing its end and Carlo Ancelotti introduced a baby-faced striker who had already made his name as Turkish Messi . His thunderous strike with his favoured left-foot against Georgia made the world take notice.He failed to add to his tally over the rest of the tournament, but Guler still played a pivotal role as Turkey made it to the quarterfinals, where they lost to the Netherlands. Back in 2022, Mesut Ozil told the teenager: ""You will be a world star."" He has become one in Germany.His season-ending goal in the FA Cup final against Man City has become an Old Trafford folklore but Mainoo cemented a place in the England midfield in this Euro. At the age of 19 years and 82 days, Mainoo became the youngest-ever to represent England in the semifinals of a major.His tender age never became a deterrent as he took charge of the midfield and caught the eye with his silken turns and sudden acceleration. Mainoo's poise, balance, intelligence and work ethic will serve England for many years to come.Youngest keeper to play in the Euro for 60 years, the 1.93m shot stopper has made his name in this Euro. He made key stops in their 2-1 opening group game win over Poland. Against France, he kept an impressive clean sheet.It was in the closing stages of the quarterfinal against Turkey though that Verbruggen really came to the fore. Turkey threw everything they had at ruining the Dutch turnaround. Verbruggen made a one-handed reaction save from Kerem Akturkoglu.

Argentina seek 'triple crown' but Colombia aim for upset in Copa America final,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/argentina-seek-triple-crown-but-colombia-aim-for-upset-in-copa-america-final/articleshow/111703169.cms,"NEW DELHI: Argentina are on the brink of achieving an unprecedented feat in South American football by winning three consecutive major tournaments if they can defeat a strong Colombian side in the Copa America final on Sunday.Led by the talismanic Lionel Messi, Argentina secured the Copa America title in 2021 and followed it up with a World Cup victory the following year.They have progressed to the final this weekend against Colombia with relative ease.A victory would not only make Argentina the second team in international football history to win a World Cup sandwiched between two continental titles, after Spain's achievements in 2008, 2010, and 2012, but it would also give them a record-breaking 16th Copa America title, surpassing their current shared record of 15 with Uruguay.However, Colombia enters the highly anticipated match at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami with an impressive unbeaten run of 28 games, a national record. They have arguably faced a more challenging path to the final, having overcome Uruguay 1-0 in the semi-finals despite being reduced to ten men for the entire second half.The final promises to be a perfect conclusion to the tournament, with the two best teams competing for the title in front of what is expected to be a passionate and lively crowd, given the significant presence of both Argentinian and Colombian communities in Miami.While Argentina, ranked number one in the world by FIFA and boasting a well-established team, are the favourites, the match is expected to be closely contested.""Scaloni knows them all by heart. Argentina today have a solidity that is foolproof and they have the added bonus of having the best player in the world, which is why they are the big favourites,"" said former Chile and Inter Milan striker Ivan Zamorano, who is covering the tournament is a television pundit.But former Colombia star midfielder Carlos Valderrama believes a surprise could be on the cards.""I see Colombia winning on Sunday,"" he told AFP, ""We have a great team to dream about.""I am optimistic about the national team, because of the process and the results they have been getting, and also because of the way they are playing.""The team is unbeaten, is playing well in the Copa, with James (Rodriguez) as the best player in the tournament, so we can dream of being champions because we have a great team,"" he added.Carlos Valderrama, a former Colombian midfield maestro, thinks an unexpected outcome might be in store.Despite never fully meeting expectations at the club level, Rodriguez, who captivated the world with his 2014 World Cup performances in Brazil, is now playing some of his best football for his country at the age of 34.Colombia's only Copa America victory was in 2001.For Argentina, there is a sentimental aspect to Sunday's match, as it will also serve as a farewell to the national team for Angel Di Maria, who is 36 years old.""I'm not ready for my last game with the national team, but it's time,"" he said this week.""A thousand things can happen, but I think that whatever happens I can go out on a high note. I've done everything to be able to leave through that door,"" added the Benfica midfielder.Nicolas Otamendi's future with the team is uncertain, as he may also leave. However, it is unclear if this will be Messi's final tournament, considering he will be 39 years old when the 2026 World Cup takes place.""I'm living it like everything else in recent times: enjoying it very much and being aware, like Fideo (Di Maria) and Ota (Otamendi), that these are the last battles,"" the eight-times Ballon d'Or winner said after the semi-final win.CONMEBOL, the tournament organizers, are hopeful that the conflicts will be limited to the football pitch, in contrast to the events that unfolded in Charlotte.The conclusion of the game between Colombia and Uruguay was marred by violent altercations among fans, with Uruguayan players entering the crowd and participating in the brawls.""We want to reaffirm and warn that no action will be tolerated that tarnishes this global football celebration,"" CONMEBOL said in a statement on Thursday.These incidents have cast a shadow over the tournament, which is being regarded as a trial run for the venues that will host matches during the 2026 World Cup, jointly hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico.Although Charlotte is not a designated host city for the 2026 World Cup, Miami is set to host seven games, including a quarter-final and the third-place match.","Argentina face Colombia in the Copa America final on Sunday. Victory for Argentina would see them win three consecutive major tournaments. Colombia are unbeaten in 28 games, a national record.

Carlos Alcaraz wants 'perfect' Sunday for Spain at Wimbledon and Euros,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon/carlos-alcaraz-wants-perfect-sunday-for-spain-at-wimbledon-and-euros/articleshow/111703580.cms,"NEW DELHI: Carlos Alcaraz is determined to contribute to a flawless sporting Sunday for his homeland, Spain. His goal is to secure victory in the Wimbledon final against Novak Djokovic prior to Spain's clash with England in the Euro 2024 championship match.Having triumphed 6-7 (1/7), 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 against fifth seed Daniil Medvedev in the semi-final on Friday, Alcaraz finds himself just one win away from clinching his second consecutive Wimbledon title.The young Spaniard, an avid supporter of Real Madrid, extended an invitation to the club's renowned midfielder Luka Modric to witness the Wimbledon semi-final from the players' box.Throughout the Euros, Alcaraz has maintained communication with the Spanish team.His aspiration is to commence a momentous day for Spain by emerging victorious and hoisting the prestigious All England Club trophy, mere hours before his nation's footballers take on England in the Euro 2024 final in Berlin.""Being a Spaniard, yeah, it would be a perfect Sunday,"" he said.""It's going to be a really fun day for Spanish people watching my final, watching the Euros final.""Obviously these last days I've spoke with a few (Spain) players. We send best of luck in every match. Obviously we send the best of luck on Sunday.""Alcaraz, a beloved player at Wimbledon, made a playful remark during his post-match interview after defeating Medvedev. His lighthearted comment about the possibility of an all-Spanish championship Sunday could have potentially irked the All England Club spectators.""It will be a good day for Spanish people as well,"" Alcaraz said when asked to look ahead to the weekend.Alcaraz's comment about the upcoming day elicited playful jeers from the audience, but he responded with a grin, saying: ""I didn't say Spain is going to win but I say it will be a fun, fun day.""The highly anticipated match between Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic is expected to conclude before the start of the Euro final between Spain and England. The young Spanish tennis star remarked: ""I have to think of my work. Hopefully let's see if the final is going to be at a good hour to watch the Euros final.""Alcaraz also discussed his growing friendship with Luka Modric, the Croatian midfielder who has achieved remarkable success with Real Madrid, winning six Champions League titles and four La Liga championships.""Yeah, Luka is a really nice person. We've met a couple of times,"" Alcaraz said, expressing his admiration for the accomplished footballer.""We spoke a little bit. He wanted to come. There's always going to be spot for him. Amazing guy, amazing athlete that I admire a lot. It's great to have him in the box supporting.""Alcaraz, the young tennis sensation, is on the cusp of securing his fourth Grand Slam victory. However, he remains mindful of the formidable challenge that lies ahead in the form of Novak Djokovic, who is in pursuit of making history.Djokovic, the seasoned Serbian player, has the opportunity to match Roger Federer's impressive feat of eight Wimbledon men's singles titles. Moreover, a victory at this tournament would propel him to an unprecedented 25th Grand Slam title, surpassing the current record held in both men's and women's singles.""Everybody knows Djokovic. He has played multiple Grand Slam finals and won a lot of them. Last year it was a really difficult match. He put me in real trouble,"" he said.""But, yeah, I know how it's going to feel playing against Djokovic. I know what I have to do. I'm sure he knows what he has to do to beat me.""It's going to be a really interesting one. But I'm ready to take that challenge and I'm ready to do it well.""",Carlos Alcaraz is just one win away from clinching his second consecutive Wimbledon title.

Anderson Vs Kohli: Anderson vs Kohli and Sachin: A Battle to Remember,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/anderson-vs-kohli-and-sachin-a-battle-to-remember/articleshow/111701362.cms,"Chennai: “Let me know if you want to become a part of our support-staff.” As the curtain fell on the career of one of the greatest of all time, the unique job offer from James Anderson made six years ago came to mind.It was the summer of 2018 and Anderson was suddenly hit by a force that hadn’t really bothered him till then. Virat Kohli had discovered a way to deal with the legendary English paceman and Anderson, then 35, was caught off-guard.After the immense struggles of 2014, when Anderson had got Kohli four times for virtually nothing, the Indian master had come to England with a plan.Kohli threw the age-old formula of playing late against English swing bowlers out of the window and decided to take guard outside the crease against Anderson and his pace partner Stuart Broad. The then Indian captain decided that he would play the Anderson delivery before it breaks for the swing, turning the duel into one of the most riveting contests that you can ever witness.In the first Test in Birmingham on a mighty difficult track, Kohli got a magnificent century in the first innings by taking on Anderson. Yes, he offered a couple of difficult chances which weren’t grabbed, but that’s par for the course. It was an innings of incredible quality and when Anderson was bombarded with questions on Kohli by the Indian journalists, the English pacer looked slightly annoyed. When TOI asked him whether he would look to bowl slightly short to counter Kohli’s new method of taking guard outside the crease, the unique job offer (with a hint of irritation) mentioned above came about.After the complete one-sided nature of the 2014 series when Anderson ruled over Kohli, the Englishman couldn’t get the Indian great out once in the 2018 series. England won the series 4-1, Anderson had his moments in the sun, but this became one of the most iconic battles ever. The English pacer, who bowled in international cricket for the last time in Lord’s on Friday, had to wait for three more years to get Kohli’s scalp twice in 2021, but by then the honours had been shared.Anderson had Kohli seven times in 25 Tests that they played against each other, but the Englishman has a far better record against Sachin Tendulkar . The king of swing got the Little Master nine times in the 14 games that they played, yet Anderson feels “Sachin is the batter I have ever bowled to”.The statement seems slightly contradictory because of the success-rate, but it probably boils down to the fact that Anderson couldn’t make Tendulkar change his game. The man with 51 Test hundreds remained the same player, going about his business in the classical way of playing it late, as he won and lost in equal measure against the best swing bowler of the 21st century.Sachin and Anderson had some fascinating battles over the years, but the one that probably stands out is one of their latter duels at Eden Gardens in 2012. The series was 1-1 at that stage and on a murky Kolkata day, Tendulkar batted brilliantly in the first two sessions, dealing with the swing of Anderson in his beautiful, old-fashioned way. It was in the third session that Anderson made one to swing as late as possible that kissed the outside edge of Sachin’s bat and the catch was completed by the keeper. Our hearts broke, the match swung, the series turned, but over time we were left to cherish those memories that still makes cricket a beautiful game.","James Anderson bowled in international cricket for the last time in Lord’s on Friday.

Euro 2024: Why Germany's labour law is prohibiting Lamine Yamal to play for 90 minutes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/uefa-euro-2024/euro-2024-why-germanys-labour-law-is-prohibiting-lamine-yamal-to-play-for-90-minutes/articleshow/111666779.cms,"Top Picks For You Lamine Yamal: The youngest player to score a goal in Euro finals

NEW DELHI: Lamine Yamal , that 16-year-old Barcelona star, has taken the Football world by fire. It seems that whatever he does becomes a record or breaks the one. The moment he took the field for Spain against Croatia, Yamal became the youngest player ever to play in the European Championship, aged 16 years and 338 days.Moments later he set another record by providing an assist to Dani Carvajal in Spain's 3-0 win against Croatia, becoming the youngest player ever to assist in Euro, although he didn't score in the match.But eventually, he would score.In the semi-final, France took the early lead against Spain with Randal Kolo Muani's goal in the eighth minute, thanks to a cross by Kylian Embappe. Spain was lagging when Yamal skillfully trespassed the French defence to score the equalizer. Yamal scored in the 21st minute of the match and added to his name the record of the youngest-ever player to score in Euros.Aged 16 years and 362 days, he broke the previous record of Switzerland player Johan Vonlanthen, who also scored against France, in 2004, at the age of 18 years and 141 days. Spain eventually defeated France 2-1 to enter the final. Spanish coach Luis de la Fuente praised Yamal's goal and described it as ""a touch of genius"".Despite all these achievements, coach Fuente has been finding it hard to play him for the full 90 minutes in Euros. Why? Because it is illegal in Germany, the host nation ofEuro 2024 .As per the labour law of Germany, minors are not allowed to work beyond 8 pm. Although there's some relaxation for athletes but even for them the deadline is 11 pm. While Spain's quarterfinal against Germany kicked off at 6 pm, many of their matches so far, including the semi-final against France, began at 9 pm German time. Given the 90 minutes of regulation time along with the injury time in each half, 15 minutes of break, and the post-match interviews, it would have pushed the Yamal to work beyond 11 pm.Due to German labour law, the Spanish coach was forced to sub-off Yamal in group stage matches at the 86th minute, 71st minute, and 19th minute in matches against Croatia, Italy, and Albania, respectively. If Yamal works (plays) beyond 11 PM then the Spanish FA will be fined 30,000 euros.Yamal featured for the entire duration of the match in the round of 16 match against Georgia where Spain emerged victorious with a scoreline of 4-1. However, this potentially puts the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in a position where they could face a penalty amounting to approximately $32,500. The uncertainty lies in whether the German authorities impose the fine on the RFEF or not.Interestingly, the Euro 2024 final on Monday is also scheduled to kick off at 9 pm German time, as three-time champions Spain is set to take on Harry Kane-led England. He will be, almost certainly, part of the starting XI but whether he will be subbed off or not is the question that looms large.The young Spanish winger is set to celebrate his 17th birthday just one day before the Euro 2024 final. Spain has the option to substitute him for the second half of the match. However, if they choose not to make this substitution, they can face significant legal consequences under German law.The decision to keep Yamal on the field for the entire game would result in a substantial financial penalty for the Spanish team. However, if Spain manages to secure the victory, the coaching staff and management will consider the money well spent.","Lamine Yamal, 16, is the youngest player ever to play in the European Championship.

However, just before the 41-year-old Anderson walked out to a standing ovation from the packed crowd at Lord's, Mikyle Louis executed a brilliant run out to dismiss Shoaib Bashir, triggering exuberant celebrations among the West Indies players.As a result, when Anderson emerged from the pavilion, only former West Indies skipper Jason Holder was present to greet him with a handshake.At stumps on the second day, the West Indies trailed by 171 runs with only four wickets remaining, making it almost certain that this was Anderson's final innings with the bat for England.""We spoke about it before he came out to bat, that we were going to give him a guard of honour,"" West Indies fast bowler Jayden Seales was quoted by AFP.""Obviously the run out took us all the way down to Swiss Cottage (the neighbouring district in northwest London to St John's Wood, in which Lord's is located), so it was pretty hard to do the guard of honour for the great man. Luckily, Jason caught up with him.""However, as it turned out, Anderson had to return to the dressing room without even facing a ball as debutant Jamie Smith (70) was dismissed as the last England wicket to fall.""I think the biggest missed opportunity was not seeing Jimmy face one off their left-arm spinner,"" said Smith.""That's the one regret about my innings.

James Anderson's adoring faithful pay homage to England great one last time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/james-andersons-adoring-faithful-pay-homage-to-england-great-one-last-time/articleshow/111696498.cms,"NEW DELHI: Thousands of cricket fans gathered at Lord's to witness James Anderson ’s final day of Test cricket, where England finished off the West Indies with an innings-thrashing.The 41-year-old Anderson concluded his international career spanning two decades on an emotional note. After just 12 overs on the last day, England secured a comprehensive win, with Anderson having taken his 704th and final Test wicket earlier in the match.Spectators crowded in front of the Pavilion long after the match ended, eager for one last glimpse of the England great.An entire generation of England fans has grown up seeing Anderson play Test cricket, and they were not disappointed as he appeared on the England dressing-room balcony, downing a pint of Guinness with cheers from the crowd nearly as loud as those following his wickets.Rather than give a speech, Anderson waved goodbye one last time at Lord’s, the same ground where he made his Test debut in 2003. His final wicket in Test cricket was that of Joshua Da Silva, marking the end of a stellar career where his bowling action remained largely unchanged.Anderson finishes as the leading wicket-taking fast bowler in Test history, with only Shane Warne (708 wickets) and Muttiah Muralitharan (800) ahead of him in the all-time list.""It's been quite emotional... the reaction from the crowd was pretty special,"" said Anderson. ""I'm really proud because playing for 20-odd years is an incredible effort, especially for a fast bowler, and I'm just happy that I've made it this far.""England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Richard Thompson acclaimed Anderson as ""quite simply the best Test pace bowler there has ever been"". The statement supports Anderson's impressive record of 188 Test appearances, second only to India's Sachin Tendulkar , who played 200 games.Anderson's career benefitted from England’s central contracts system, sparing him from the dual strain of Test and county cricket to the extent faced by previous generations. Comparing eras, England fast-bowling legend Fred Trueman, who was the first to take 300 Test wickets, averaged 21.57 runs per wicket in his 67 Tests while also bowling extensively for Yorkshire. By contrast, Anderson averaged 26.45 with a significantly lighter county workload at Lancashire.While many argue about the greatest fast bowlers, it’s unquestionable that Anderson’s remarkable skills in generating late movement have earned him a place among the best. His career also coincided with outstanding fast bowlers from other nations, including West Indies' Malcolm Marshall, who took 376 wickets in 81 Tests at an average of 20.94.On the final day, Anderson had the chance to take the last wicket of the match, as his longtime bowling partner Stuart Broad did against Australia the previous year. However, Anderson dropped a return catch offered by Gudakesh Motie. The match eventually concluded with debutant Gus Atkinson taking the final wicket and delivering impressive figures of 12-106, surpassing Anderson's career-best haul of 11-71.""Gus actually apologised to him for taking that last wicket and Jimmy just told him to 'eff off',"" said England captain Ben Stokes .""He's someone who loves to see other people do well. I'm sure he'd have loved to have that fairytale ending that Broady got last year but, for him, seeing a young lad come in and take 12 wickets on debut, he'd have really enjoyed that as well. He's a great player, a great person and a great man.""","James Anderson takes 704th and final Test wicket in England's innings-thrashing of West Indies at Lord's.

He believed that Anderson's decision to retire following a triumphant victory was an ideal way to conclude his illustrious career.Broad emphasized that walking off the field with a winning sensation was a fitting end for Anderson.England secured a commanding victory against the West Indies at Lord's, winning by an innings and 114 runs. This win allowed them to establish a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Gus Atkinson , making his debut, showcased exceptional performance by claiming an impressive 12 wickets throughout the match.""I thought the moment the final wicket fell, Jimmy Anderson was the first to Gus Atkinson, giving him a big hug with a smile on his face. It's felt like a passing-over, hasn't it, in terms of the success of Gus Atkinson.""""Watching him this week, how I felt is he still looks as good as ever and it's such a nice way to finish and walk off the field, knowing you can still do it. It was wonderful to see him still do what he's done for 188 Test matches and walk off with a victory.""""Regardless of the wickets and the amount he's played, to Jimmy, it's always been about those moments in the changing room of winning a Test match with the group of people you're with. For him, looking back now as a former Test cricketer, the games he's won have been outstanding. To win his last Test match is incredible,"" IANS quoted Broad as saying after the match.Former West Indies fast-bowler Ian Bishop lauded Anderson’s long career and stated, ""There are so many things we've already talked about like his longevity and his fitness.""He's gone where no fast bowler has gone before in terms of wickets.” ""But from a skill perspective, the ability to swing the ball and be consistent with his length, the art of evolving over 20 years. I think he's shifted the thinking in the game. He has shifted paradigms and dimensions for fast bowlers. This a sense of immortality here for James Anderson,"" he said.Anderson, having concluded his illustrious Test career, secured his position as the third-highest wicket-taker in the format, amassing an impressive tally of 704 scalps at a commendable average of 26.45 across 188 appearances.As he transitions into his new role as England's bowling mentor for the upcoming Test home summer, his long-time teammate Broad believes that Anderson's wealth of experience and expertise will prove invaluable in guiding and nurturing the team's bowling unit during practice sessions.""A lot of the time, it's not the information you're sharing, it's when you're doing it and picking that time. If you go to a bowler who has just bowled eight overs for 70 and try to do something technical, that's not the right time - let them calm down.""""He's got Brendon McCullum, who's the absolute best in the business at knowing the right time to share information and check in on how things are going. Jimmy doesn't strike me as the sort of fast-bowling coach who will have a meeting after meeting, he'll drip-feed information in the nets,"" he said.Asked on how England's bowling unit adapts without Anderson in Tests, Broad remarked, ""What the bowling group does, is it's so important to share information consistently. If you take Jimmy Anderson out of that attack, they'll need to be talking and need to be sharing, and not go insular and be careful. Gus Atkinson is going to go (to Trent Bridge) full of confidence. I think we will see, this summer, him take the new ball.""","Former England fast bowler Stuart Broad expressed his thoughts on James Anderson's retirement from international cricket.

He would assign tasks and roles to players and he has always been a ‘team coach', he always wants to win and everyone to give their 100 per cent,” Avesh said.Avesh has been satisfied with his performance, taking six wickets in three matches. He highlighted the varying conditions at the Harare Sports Club, noting the nuances of the pitch over different games.“We have played on different wickets here. We played the first two matches on the same deck, there was good bounce in the first match but in the second it had flattened out. The conditions are good, since it is an open ground the ball also swings a bit,” he said.“But since these matches are played in daytime, sometimes the wicket dries up but as a bowler you should be prepared to bowl in all situations.”“I always try to take wickets for my team and with bigger boundaries here, as a bowler that is enjoyable,” Avesh added.Avesh said he finds joy in bowling on grounds with larger boundaries, focusing on taking wickets for his team. He placed a strong emphasis on making his captain's job easier by being adaptable in various stages of the game.“I try to give a freehand to the captain, in terms of using me whenever he wants to. If a captain has a bowler who can be used in all three stages — powerplay, middle overs and in the death — his number of options increases,” he said.“As a bowler, I always think of providing that as an option, bring in new elements such as developing a slow bouncer or a leg-cutter from outside off-stump or near the wide line,” Avesh added.Avesh said Jasprit Bumrah's clarity of thoughts in execution as a bowler sets him apart, which is something he wants to emulate as well.“Like Virat bhai said, he is once in a generation bowler, it is true and we all believe so. His style of bowling and his mindset are different, but main (thing) is his execution, for which we all practice,” he said.“Whenever I speak with him, he tells me to focus on the execution. If you are thinking of sending down a yorker, then it has to be a yorker; it cannot be a full toss or a half volley, a bouncer has to be on the shoulders; a length ball has to be (aimed at) the top of off (stump),” Avesh added.","Avesh Khan has worked under Gautam Gambhir's mentorship at Lucknow Super Giants in IPL.

NEW DELHI: Brian Lara , the iconic West Indian batsman, expressed his opinion that the challenges faced by the West Indies team in Test cricket cannot be solely attributed to financial factors.He emphasized that the team's struggles also stem from their inability to effectively utilize the talented players currently available within their cricketing system.The West Indies find themselves in a precarious position in the first Test match of the three-game series against England . After being dismissed for a meager 121 runs in their first innings at Lord's, the West Indies conceded a substantial lead of 250 runs to the hosts.As the second day of the match concluded, the visiting team's prospects appeared bleak, with their second innings score standing at 79/6 after 34.5 overs, trailing England by 171 runs.Legendary England pacer James Anderson ’s final appearance before international retirement saw the 41-year-old paceman take a typically frugal 3-32 in 16 overs as the West Indies were dismissed for just 136 on Friday to give England victory by an innings and 114 runs inside three days.""If you put 100 million, 200 million dollars into the West Indies' bank account, is it going to change the way we play the game? I'm not sure. We are not harnessing the talent that we have,"" IANS quoted Lara as saying on BBC World Service's Stumped podcast.The West Indies cricket team finds itself in a challenging position, currently occupying the eighth spot in the ICC's Test rankings.Additionally, they failed to qualify for the semi-finals of the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup , which they co-hosted alongside the USA. This stands in stark contrast to their glorious past, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s when they were a formidable force in the cricketing world.Several factors have contributed to this decline. One significant issue is the increasing preference of players to participate in white-ball leagues, which has diverted their focus from representing the West Indies in international cricket.Moreover, cricket has lost its prominence in the Caribbean, with other sports like Athletics gaining more popularity among the youth. As a result, the talent pool available for cricket has diminished, further impacting the team's performance on the global stage.""Obviously, cricket has been diluted by the number of different sports and different opportunities for kids, but I still believe that corporate West Indies have got to get involved.""The West Indies Cricket Board hasn't done the right job in attracting these sponsors to ensure that at least grassroots, but also the academy, all the different things, the facilities, are up to standard. I think these things are very, very important,"" added Lara.",Brian Lara says the West Indies are not harnessing the talent that they have.

Furthermore, various state governments also declared cash rewards for the cricketers hailing from their respective states.However, the decision by the Maharashtra government to award cash rewards specifically for their state cricketers drew criticism from prominent Indian badminton player Chirag Shetty . He highlighted the need to recognize and appreciate the achievements of athletes from other sports as well.Echoing a similar sentiment, fellow shuttler Saina Nehwal expressed her concerns about the disproportionate attention and recognition that cricket receives compared to other sports in India.""Everyone wants to know what Saina is doing, what wrestlers and boxers are doing, what Neeraj Chopra is doing.

Ashwin reveals how an angry MS Dhoni put Sreesanth in his place,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ashwin-reveals-how-an-angry-ms-dhoni-put-sreesanth-in-his-place/articleshow/111691772.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ravichandran Ashwin 's autobiography, 'I Have The Streets - A Kutty Cricket Story,' is a captivating read that spans his journey from his early years to India's momentous World Cup victory in 2011.The 184-page book is filled with amusing anecdotes and occasional insights into Ashwin's innovative mindset, always eager to explore unconventional approaches.The book is co-authored by Sidharth Monga and published by Penguin Random House .One of the most gripping stories in the book revolves around an incident in Port Elizabeth (now known as Gqeberha) in 2010, during a limited overs match against South Africa.An infuriated Mahendra Singh Dhoni instructed Ashwin to tell team manager Ranjib Biswal to book S Sreesanth on the next available flight back home.The reason behind this decision was Sreesanth's repeated disregard for the skipper's calls to sit in the dug-out with other reserves for a massage in the dressing room.The book also delves into Ashwin's ' Mankading ' debut as a teenager and WV Raman 's efforts in shaping him into a formidable off-spinner.While the autobiography steers clear of sob stories and excessive dramatization, it offers readers an engaging and insightful look into the life and career of one of India's most talented cricketers.""I take water. MS drinks. Two overs later, I take more. He drinks more. Then again. I have carried more water for MS than anyone else. When I go in for the drink break, MS asks, ‘Where is Sree?' PTI quoted Ashwin's narration.""It is possibly the most neutral way of asking a question. It is also the MS way. You just can't make out why he is asking. I don't know what to tell him because I don't know what it might lead to. MS insists on finding out.""I tell him Sree is upstairs in the dressing room. He tells me to tell Sree he has to come down and sit with the other reserves.""""Anyway, on the way back from the drinks break, I am wondering how, while keeping wicket in an international match, MS even noticed that Sree was not sitting downstairs. I go back and tell M. Vijay, who is in his cooling glasses with his feet up on another chair, ‘Hey, Monk, MS asked Sree to come down.""Monk tells me, ‘Hey, you go and tell him. Don't expect me to do that.'""......I go into the changing room and I tell him, ‘Sree, MS wants you to come down.' ‘Why? You can't carry water?' responds Sreesanth.""I tell him I didn't say anything. He said he wants you to come down. He said the reserves should be together for the game. Sree says, ‘Okay, you go. I will come.'""I return to my drink duties. The next time I have to go with a helmet. This time I can sense MS is angry, and I have never seen him lose his cool. ‘Where is Sree? What is he doing?' MS asks sternly.""""I tell him he is getting a massage. MS doesn't say anything. In the next over, he calls me to return the helmet. He is calm now. While giving me the helmet, he says, ‘Do one thing. Go to Ranjib sir. Tell him Sree is not interested in being here. Ask him to book his ticket for tomorrow so he can go back to India.""""I am stunned. I'm not sure what to say. I am just staring at his face. MS goes, ‘What happened? You don't understand English either now?'Ashwin humorously described the effectiveness of the solution, stating that 'it worked like magic'.""Sree quickly gets up and gets dressed. Not only that, but now he assumes the drinks duties. The next time MS needs a drink, Sree makes sure he charges out. Instead of taking the drink from him, MS motions for me to come over. ‘Did you tell Ranjib sir or not?' he asks me.""MS and Sree sort it out later, but during that period I am caught in a situation in which I would ideally be laughing but am too scared to do so,"" wrote the second Indian bowler to take 500 wickets in Tests.Ashwin, known for his strong belief in adhering to the rules and maintaining fairness in the sport, shared a memory from his childhood. He recalled an incident during a school cricket match when his father, Ravichandran, instructed him to dismiss the non-striker for gaining an unfair advantage by leaving the crease prematurely.""At twelve, I am bowling during a tense climax for Rao's Cricket Clinic, our PSBB school coach Chandrasekhar Rao's team, against DAV Gopalapuram at the RKM Cricket Ground, when I see Appa gesture from behind the striker that the non-striker is stealing ground even before I let the ball go.""He wants me to Mankad him. I do it. No one thinks it's weird, and there are no protests. The coach just doesn't speak to Appa for a week.""The book also highlights the deep respect for former India opener WV Raman, who is highly esteemed in Indian cricket for his technical expertise.""Raman and I are made for each other. For the life of me, I can't keep repeating the same thing. And Raman the coach comes up with something every day to help me keep discovering spin bowling to its fullest,"" he wrote elaborating how Raman improved his technique by straightening his run-up from an angular one, which helped correct his alignment and enhanced his overall performance.","Ashwin's autobiography, 'I Have The Streets - A Kutty Cricket Story,' is a captivating read.

Sangita Basfore also had an opportunity to score, but the soggy conditions prevented her from capitalizing on the chance.As the rain eased up, the game became more free-flowing, and India continued to create opportunities, with Karishma Shirvoikar firing wide from outside the box at the half-hour mark.Myanmar had a golden opportunity to take the lead in the 61st minute, but Indian skipper Loitongbam Ashalata Devi's goal-line clearance denied them, showcasing the team's defensive resilience.Despite facing challenging conditions and a formidable opponent, they displayed a never-say-die attitude, attacking intent, and a willingness to fight until the final whistle.","The Indian senior women's football team held the hosts Myanmar to a 1-1 draw in their second and final friendly match on Friday.

NEW DELHI: Ollie Watkins scored a late winner as England defeated the Netherlands 2-1 to reach the Euro final against Spain. However, the excitement around the match was marred by controversy surrounding a penalty awarded to England after a VAR review, which Harry Kane converted to level the scores after Xavi Simons had given the Dutch the lead. The penalty decision was heavily criticized, with Gary Neville labelling it ""an absolute disgrace"".England forward Harry Kane was being well-defended near the scoring area by Netherlands' Denzel Dumfries and the ball sailed over the posts and a goal kick was awarded to the Dutch. However, Harry Kane sat on the ground clutching his leg which prompted VAR to urge Felix Zwayer to review the incident. After this, England were awarded a penalty and Harry Kane saw things through and put England back in the game.Watch:Controversy arose over a penalty awarded to England after Denzel Dumfries fouled Harry Kane, with some questioning an alleged handball by Bukayo Saka in the build-up. VAR did not identify the infringement. A supporter claimed VAR missed or ignored Saka’s handball, calling England lucky.According to UEFA's rule, it's a foul if a player prevents an opponent from playing the ball due to 'fear of getting injured.' Playing recklessly or dangerously, even without physical contact, is still punishable with a free kick or penalty.VAR (Video Assistant Referee) is a technology system conceived by the KNVB in 2010 to help reduce on-field errors in football. It assists referees by reviewing decisions related to goals, penalty decisions, direct red-card incidents, and mistaken identity. After extensive trials, VAR was first used in professional football in 2016 and has since been adopted by major leagues and international tournaments, including the FIFA World Cup and UEFA Champions League, to improve decision accuracy and fairness in the game.VAR only reviews four match-changing situations: goals, penalty decisions, direct red-card incidents, and mistaken identity.VAR won't review fouls or handballs in the middle of the pitch without a goal or penalty decision, or incorrect corner awards leading to goals, as it only checks the immediate attacking phase starting from the corner.VAR can intervene in direct red-card incidents and mistaken identity cases for clear and obvious errors or serious missed incidents, even when play is stopped. The VAR has a short window to act on unseen incidents. The FA's retrospective disciplinary process handles incidents missed by both match officials and VAR.VAR can intervene for clear and obvious errors by on-field officials regarding goalkeeper movement, double touches by the penalty taker, feigning at the kick, and encroachment with a direct impact. The 2020/21 protocol doesn't allow tolerance levels, so if a goalkeeper saves a penalty with a foot over the goalline, VAR advises a retake. If the goalkeeper is off the line and the ball misses, it’s only retaken if the goalkeeper materially impacted the miss. Encroachment is judged by any part of a player’s body on the ground at the kick, and the player must materially impact the outcome for it to be penalized.The VAR can intervene on unseen incidents until the next restart if the ball is in play, or until the second restart if the ball is out of play.","England defeated the Netherlands 2-1 in the Euro 2024 semi-final.

in the semis

LONDON: Lorenzo Musetti 's play has been doing some talking at Wimbledon . The 22-yearold Italian is the owner of a single-handed backhand, that's all art, and a forehand that's precise and fiery. Timing is his touch. Musetti, 6 ft 1', is slightly built, and has wheels that are both fast and sturdy.If the world No.25's win over Taylor Fritz in the quarterfinals on Wednesday, putting him in the last-four of a Grand Slam for the first time in his career, is any indication of the mental miles he may have covered in recent weeks, expect a cracker of a last-four clash against the seven-time champion Novak Djokovic on Friday.In the first of the last-four clashes -defending champion Carlos Alcaraz goes up against Daniil Medvedev in a replay of their US Open semifinals last September.Musetti trails Djokovic 1-5 in head-to-head clashes, their rivalry (so far) bookended by their only two meetings in majors, both at Roland Garros , and on both occasions Musetti going down in five-sets without winning a game in the deciding set. The first time was three years ago, a teenager then, he retired from the match (when trailing 0-4 in the fifth set) and again last month in the third round after Musetti had taken the second and third sets.The Italian was in a similar situation against Fritz, leading by two-sets-to-one. The American fell back 0-40 in the fifth game of the fourth set, where Musetti had four chances to break, but came up short.The Italian media groaned in unison, they had seen this before. In his box his long-time coach Simone Tartarini could hardly believe all that was playing out before him.Musetti was doing a Musetti again. Until he undid it in a stirring fifth set where he lost just 13 points. The 22-year-old's Roland Garros third-round match against Djokovic finished at 3 am. ""I had my chances. I didn't take the chances, especially in the fourth where I was leading,"" Musetti said at Wimbledon, some 40 days later. ""I have analyzed that match, the key moments and where I could do better. I put myself in that position again. In the past weeks, I started to feel more continuous with that attitude.""In his two grasscourt events before Wimbledon Musetti made the semifinal in Stuttgart and final at Queen's Club. ""Even against Fritz I have that attitude, especially after losing the first set where I didn't feel my serve really well. I didn't feel the ball. I was a little bit nervous,"" he said.""Then immediately with a positive attitude I changed my mindset, and also the feeling with the ball was better.""The Italian's victory over Fritz has given him a 4-6 win-loss record in five-set matches.""I've had many, many tough losses (at Grand Slams). Especially in the French Open ,"" he said. ""The losses made me think, made me work harder.""""With Djokovic, I always finished the match with a lesson,"" Musetti said. ""Against him you are probably more stressed because he's probably the best player ever or one of the best players ever.

Wimbledon: Jasmine Paolini outlasts Donna Vekic to reach second consecutive Grand Slam final,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon/wimbledon-jasmine-paolini-outlasts-donna-vekic-to-reach-second-consecutive-grand-slam-final/articleshow/111675292.cms,"LONDON: Jasmine Paolini sprinted across the lawn and chased down a drop shot midway through the Wimbledon semifinal. Donna Vekic replied with a heavily spun topspin lob. The Italian had no business getting to the ball, she was almost kissing the net cord when she turned and charged back to the baseline. Racket on ball, she got it over the net. Vekic, whose forehand was calling the shots until that point, thumped the ball wide.Centre Court gasped.There was a hint of a smile on Paolini's expressive face, a reminder perhaps to never count her out. Vekic, hands on hips, also smiled, but for a whole different reason.That right there - with the sun casting a glow on SW19 for the second successive afternoon - was where the first of the ladies' semifinals turned. An extraordinary contest, where every nook and corner of the court was used and covered. Lines met angles and power met poise.Paolini, the No. 7 seed, stopped the inspired run of Vekic, 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (8) in two hours and 51 minutes in the longest women's singles match in Wimbledon history.Paolini, the first Italian woman to reach the Wimbledon final in the Open Era, and the first player to reach the final at Roland Garros and the Championships in the same year since Serena Williams in 2016, will play the winner of the Elena Rybakina-Barbora Krecjikova clash in the title match on Saturday.What turned the three-hour affair into gripping cinema was the back stories of these two women, both 28 years of age.Some of the shots Vekic hit, you could see a lifetime's work on it.

I think my return has improved,"" Rybakina said of her play.""The serve is helping me, even though today maybe not a high percentage, but in important moments, I served it out.""
