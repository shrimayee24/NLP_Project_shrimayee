When MS Dhoni defied 'back pain' to guide India to 2011 World Cup title win - WATCH,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/when-ms-dhoni-defied-back-pain-to-guide-india-to-2011-world-cup-title-win/articleshow/113182914.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ravi Shastri 's fervent commentary from the 2011 World Cup final - ""Dhoni finishes it off in style, India lifts the World Cup after 28 years"" - continues to echo in the minds of Indian cricket enthusiasts. Dhoni's iconic six over mid-on against Sri Lanka's Nuwan Kulasekara , which clinched the victory for India at a packed Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, concluded a nearly three-decade wait for the trophy and provided over a billion Indians with an extraordinary reason to rejoice.Despite being hampered by back pain during the final match against Sri Lanka, Dhoni led by example, steering India to their second ODI World Cup victory. India secured their maiden ODI World Cup title under the leadership of Kapil Dev in 1983 when they triumphed over the formidable West Indies in the championship match at the renowned Lord's Cricket Ground.In pursuit of a target of 275 in the 2011 World Cup final against Sri Lanka, Dhoni elevated himself in the batting order, ahead of the in-form Yuvraj Singh, to handle the immense pressure of the occasion.The Indian skipper exhibited remarkable composure, contributing an unbeaten 91 runs off 79 deliveries. His innings showcased exceptional poise and shot selection, featuring eight boundaries and two sixes in his outstanding performance.The defining moment that secured the championship occurred in the 49th over when Dhoni launched a magnificent six off Kulasekara, a shot that has since become legendary in Indian cricket history.Since that unforgettable evening in Mumbai, India has been unable to recapture the ODI World Cup.Despite reaching the semi-finals in 2015 and 2019, and final in the 2023 edition, the coveted third title has remained elusive, further enhancing the significance of Dhoni's 2011 achievement.Dhoni stands alone as the only captain in cricket history to secure all three major ICC trophies. He spearheaded India's triumph in the 2007 ICC T20 World Cup, signaling the global rise of T20 cricket. In 2011, Dhoni led India to their second ODI World Cup victory.Two years later, in 2013, he guided India to an ICC Champions Trophy success, overcoming England in the final. Rohit Sharma has now joined Dhoni as an Indian captain who has won the T20 World Cup. Under Rohit's leadership, India emerged victorious against South Africa in a thrilling final in Barbados to claim the prestigious trophy.","Dhoni is the only captain in cricket history to secure all three major ICC trophies.

NEW DELHI: India's star pacer Jasprit Bumrah , who served as the vice-captain during the Test series against England earlier this year, will not hold the same position in the upcoming first Test against Bangladesh. Although he remains a part of the squad, Bumrah will play as a regular team member rather than being Rohit Sharma 's deputy.Bumrah is regarded as a key leader within the team, along with KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant , and Virat Kohli.While Kohli has opted to avoid any official leadership roles, Rahul and Pant are seen as potential future Test captains. Interestingly, the team has not designated a vice-captain for the Bangladesh series.The absence of the vice-captaincy role for Bumrah suggests that the BCCI and team management may not envision him as a future captain. This could stem from the need to carefully manage his workload.Bumrah has previously captained India, notably in the rescheduled 2022 Test against England and the 2023 match against Ireland, where his leadership was praised. However, a captain's consistent availability is crucial, and Bumrah’s injury history might hinder that.With Gautam Gambhir now at the helm as head coach, India's approach to vice-captaincy has shifted. Hardik Pandya was replaced by Suryakumar Yadav in T20Is, and Shubman Gill has taken over the vice-captaincy duties in both ODIs and T20Is, raising speculation about his potential role in Test cricket.The first Test between India and Bangladesh is set to begin on September 19 at MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, followed by the second Test at Green Park Stadium in Kanpur from September 27.Rohit Sharma (c), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Sarfaraz Khan, Rishabh Pant (wk), Dhruv Jurel (wk), Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Jasprit Bumrah, Yash Dayal.",India's star pacer Jasprit Bumrah will not hold the same position in the upcoming first Test against Bangladesh.

His failure as Mumbai Indians' skipper last season and the BCCI selectors' concern related to his fitness saw him losing India's T20I captaincy to Suryakumar.However, it remains to be seen who the Indian cricket board feels can step into Rohit's shoes and fits the bill to lead the team in all three formats.On the latest episode of Cricbuzz show 'heyCB', former India wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik was asked this question by a fan: ""Who will be India's future captain of all formats?""""Two players come straight into my mind, who are young, have the potential and definitely can lead India in all the formats in the near future.

A BCCI source clarified that Rahul's recent performance and fitness are key factors.""For people on the outside, they don't understand how a team works and what are the systems in place. In his last three Test matches, KL scored a century in South Africa, one of the best Test knocks in recent times and 86 at Hyderabad in the last Test he played before injury.He was not dropped but got injured. So, he is fit and available, scored a fifty in Duleep, got match time and he will start,"" a BCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity.Sarfaraz Khan had a stellar domestic season and made a strong debut with twin half-centuries against England at Rajkot and another fifty at Dharamsala. His performance showcased his precise footwork and ability to handle both fast and slow bowlers.""Sarfaraz has done everything right and mind it, if there is an injury anywhere, he will just walk in but Rahul's experience is irreplaceable. And the team management is not just looking at Bangladesh, they are looking at Australia where previous experience matters,"" the source added.Despite missing two previous Test tours of Australia due to injuries, Rahul scored a century in Sydney in 2014. While his career average of less than 35 after 50 Tests is not impressive, his knack for scoring at significant overseas venues like Sydney, Lord's, Oval, and Centurion, combined with his extensive range of strokes, keeps him ahead in the pecking order.The same principle of continuity applies to the wicketkeeper position, where Rishabh Pant 's exceptional Test credentials make him the preferred choice over the talented Dhruv Jurel, who performed admirably in the England series.Jurel is a fine talent and did well in the England series but Pant is an exceptional Test player. Jurel will have to wait for his chance.One position with notable competition is the third spinner's spot, where Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel are contenders. Axar showcased his skills with both the bat and ball in the recent Duleep Trophy, taking three wickets and scoring 86 runs on a challenging green top at Anantapur. Kuldeep, on the other hand, struggled to make an impact in the same tournament.However, Kuldeep's previous success against Bangladesh in the 2022 away series and his array of variations might give him an edge on favorable batting tracks.Sarfaraz Khan and Dhruv Jurel have proven their potential, but for now, the emphasis seems to be on experience and previously demonstrated success, as India looks to balance immediate responsibilities with strategic preparations for the Australia tour.","Sarfaraz Khan and Dhruv Jurel have proven their potential, but for now, the emphasis seems to be on experience and previously demonstrated success.

Why has Virat Kohli never been auctioned in Indian Premier League?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/why-has-virat-kohli-never-been-auctioned-in-indian-premier-league/articleshow/113197142.cms,"NEW DELHI: The IPL 2025 auction is fast approaching, and one of the most pressing questions on everyone's mind is which players will be retained by their current teams before the anticipated mega auction. Virat Kohli , the batting maestro, is often a topic of discussion when it comes to IPL auctions. However, an interesting fact emerges: despite his immense popularity and skill, Kohli has never been sold in an IPL auction throughout his career with the Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ).The reason behind this mystery is quite simple, yet it has managed to evade many fans and followers of the game.Kohli joined RCB in 2008, the inaugural season of the IPL, as a young emerging player. At that time, Kohli was a member of the Indian U-19 team that had recently won the Under-19 World Cup, and his potential was recognised by RCB, who signed him directly.In the inaugural IPL auction held in 2008, players from the U-19 category were not permitted to take part, as they were selected through a pre-season draft instead. RCB was captivated by Kohli's outstanding performance in the U-19 World Cup 2008 and decided to secure his services, especially after Delhi Capitals (DC) showed no inclination to acquire him.RCB's decision to retain Kohli over the years has kept him from entering the IPL auction. Kohli’s loyalty to the franchise and their trust in his abilities have fostered a strong relationship.The IPL allows teams to retain a certain number of players ahead of each auction, ensuring continuity and team stability. Kohli has been retained by RCB before every auction, highlighting his value to the team. His performances for the franchise have consistently been outstanding, and he quickly evolved into one of the best batsmen in the league.Furthermore, Kohli was appointed as the captain of RCB in 2013, further cementing his place in the franchise. As a captain, he became the face of the team and was central to its brand and identity.Throughout his tenure as captain, Kohli guided the team to four playoff appearances, but the coveted championship remained elusive. Following the conclusion of the 2021 season, Kohli made the decision to relinquish his leadership position.While the ultimate prize may have eluded him, Kohli's individual accomplishments in the IPL are nothing short of remarkable. With an impressive tally of 8004 runs across 252 matches, he stands as the tournament's all-time leading run-scorer, boasting an average of 38.67.Kohli's 2016 campaign was particularly noteworthy, as he amassed an astonishing 973 runs, setting the record for the most runs scored in a single IPL season.His exceptional batting prowess is further highlighted by his unparalleled feat of scoring 8 centuries in the tournament, more than any other player. Additionally, Kohli has contributed 55 half-centuries to his IPL resume thus far.The combination of his consistent performances, leadership role, and marketability made Kohli indispensable for RCB. The franchise has always prioritised his retention, preventing him from entering the IPL auction.Kohli's dedication to RCB and his deep connection with the fans have ensured that he remains one of the few players in IPL history never to have been auctioned, making his journey unique and significant in the league's history.","Virat Kohli has never been sold in an IPL auction throughout his career with the Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ).

In December 2022, Pope scored his third Test century, a quick-fire 108 off 104 balls against Pakistan in Rawalpindi.

The fourth century came in June 2023, a majestic 205 off 208 balls against Ireland at Lord's, marking his first Test double hundred.

In January 2024, Pope played one of the best innings by a visiting batter on Indian soil, scoring 196 runs against India in Hyderabad.

Pope's sixth Test century was in July 2024, when he scored 121 runs against the West Indies in Nottingham.

There was a lot of freedom and understanding with Ravi bhai. Instead of telling me not to do something, he would give me a better option. I believe in that approach.

Luka Modric in 2018

No Award Due to Covid in 2020

NEW DELHI: The Ballon d'Or nominations for the men's category were announced on Wednesday, signalling a notable change as both Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi were absent from the list for the first time since 2003. Jude Bellingham , a promising young talent from England, was among the 30 players nominated.Ronaldo, who has won the award five times, was also missing from last year's nominations.Messi, the record holder with eight Ballon d'Or victories and 16 nominations, was omitted despite Argentina's success in the Copa America this year.The nominations have elicited mixed reactions from fans, with some expressing enthusiasm for the nominated players while others are disappointed by the absence of their favourite stars, a sentiment that has persisted over time.Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, two of the greatest footballers of all time, have dominated the Ballon d'Or award for over a decade. However, there have been occasions when both these incredible players failed to secure the prestigious accolade. Let's take a look at three such instances.Karim Benzema was awarded the prestigious Ballon d'Or at a grand ceremony held at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris, France. The Real Madrid striker emerged victorious, surpassing strong contenders such as Kylian Mbappe, Erling Haaland, and Robert Lewandowski in the voting process.Benzema's exceptional performance during the 2021-22 season, where he played a pivotal role in leading Real Madrid to the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League , earned him this esteemed recognition in men's football.With this achievement, Benzema became the third player to win the award since 2008, following the dominance of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. The only other player to break their streak was Benzema's Real Madrid teammate Luka Modric , who claimed the prize in 2018. Surprisingly, Robert Lewandowski, who was considered a top contender, finished fourth in the voting.At the age of 34, Benzema became the oldest Ballon d'Or winner since Stanley Matthews in 1956. His remarkable season saw him score an impressive 44 goals in 46 appearances across all competitions, contributing significantly to Real Madrid's success under the guidance of Carlo Ancelotti.Benzema's outstanding performances in the Champions League garnered widespread praise. He showcased his goal-scoring prowess by netting hat-tricks in crucial matches, including the last-16 second leg against Paris Saint-Germain and the quarter-final first leg against Chelsea.In contrast, five-time Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo had a relatively disappointing year, finishing 20th in the 2022 rankings.Luka Modric achieved a significant milestone by winning the Ballon d'Or for the first time, becoming the first Real Madrid midfielder to receive this prestigious award from France Football magazine, which recognizes the best footballer of the previous season.Modric had an exceptional 2017/2018 season, leading Real Madrid to a Champions League victory and guiding his national team, Croatia, to a historic second-place finish at the World Cup in Russia. On an individual level, he was recognized as the best player at the World Cup after leading his side to this historic achievement.Cristiano Ronaldo, formerly of Real Madrid, and Antoine Griezmann of Atletico Madrid, secured the second and third positions, respectively. Griezmann played a crucial role in Atletico Madrid's Europa League triumph and was instrumental in France's World Cup victory.Modric's Ballon d'Or win broke the decade-long dominance of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi over the award. However, the hegemony of LaLiga remained intact, as the last ten recipients of the best footballer title had all played in the Spanish league, widely regarded as the world's best.France Football, the organizers of the Ballon d'Or, announced the cancellation of the prestigious individual award for 2020. The decision was made due to the ""exceptional circumstances"" brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the football season.This marked the first time since 1956 that the Ballon d'Or was not awarded. In 2019, Lionel Messi claimed his sixth Ballon d'Or, while Cristiano Ronaldo won the award five times. The only other player to break their 12-year dominance was Luka Modric, who won the award in 2018.The cancellation of the Ballon d'Or came after France's Ligue 1 decided to terminate the remainder of its season due to the coronavirus outbreak. In contrast, the Premier League, Serie A, and La Liga all resumed their campaigns following a three-month hiatus.","The Ballon d'Or nominations for the men's category were announced on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: While global superstars like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have etched their names in the history books, even they couldn't achieve the extraordinary feat of spending their entire careers at one club.In the ever-evolving world of football , where lucrative contracts and high-profile transfers have become the norm, there remains a rare breed of players who embody loyalty and commitment to a single club.This unique loyalty, seen in a select group of football legends , speaks volumes about the deep connection between a player and their team—a bond built on trust, passion, and unwavering dedication.These one-club legends didn’t just play for the badge; they lived for it, becoming eternal icons in the eyes of fans and securing a legacy that transcends mere statistics.Let’s take a look at a list of such footballers who, unlike Messi or Ronaldo, dedicated their entire careers to a single club, leaving an indelible mark on football history.A name synonymous with AC Milan, Paolo Maldini’s 25-year career is a testament to longevity, skill, and loyalty. With 647 league appearances and a staggering 902 total matches for the Rossoneri, Maldini is often hailed as one of the greatest defenders of all time.Not only did he evolve with the game, transitioning seamlessly from a traditional left-back to a more attacking role, but he was also recognized for his leadership, earning the nickname ""Il Capitano."" Seven Serie A titles, numerous other accolades, and a legacy of grace and grit define Maldini’s illustrious career.Francesco Totti, ""Il Capitano"", is the face of AS Roma. Over 600 appearances and 250 goals later, Totti remains the club’s highest scorer and most-capped player.Despite interest from European giants, Totti’s loyalty to his hometown club never wavered. His technical brilliance, vision, and leadership inspired generations of Roma fans, making him a symbol of loyalty and dedication in modern football.Gary Neville was the embodiment of Manchester United’s famed Class of '92. A one-club man, Neville made 602 appearances for the Red Devils, winning eight Premier League titles and two Champions League trophies.His defensive solidity and leadership made him an indispensable part of Sir Alex Ferguson’s teams.Even after his playing days, Neville continues to represent United as a pundit and ambassador, ensuring his legacy remains intertwined with the club.Giuseppe Bergomi, nicknamed ""Lo Zio"" (The Uncle), was a stalwart of Inter Milan’s defence for over 20 years. He made 756 appearances for the Nerazzurri, winning the Serie A title and three UEFA Cups.Known for his consistency and leadership, Bergomi’s loyalty to Inter saw him become one of the club’s most respected figures, earning a place in the club’s Hall of Fame.Another AC Milan great, Franco Baresi, was integral to shaping the club’s identity. Despite his relatively small stature, Baresi's unmatched ability to read the game allowed him to dominate as a sweeper.Across 719 appearances, he led Milan to six Serie A titles and three Champions League victories. His loyalty was unwavering, even staying with the club through relegation. His number six jersey was retired in his honour, a true mark of his legendary status at the club.""Mr Arsenal"" himself, Tony Adams was a pillar of strength in the heart of the Gunners' defence for 19 years. Captaining the team for 14 of those years, Adams was the epitome of leadership and resilience.Despite struggling with personal demons, including alcoholism, he led Arsenal to numerous victories, including two league titles under Arsène Wenger. His 672 appearances for the club solidified his place as one of Arsenal's greatest-ever players.Carles Puyol is the embodiment of commitment and heart for Barcelona. A versatile defender, Puyol played both as a right-back and centre-back, becoming the backbone of the club’s golden era.Over 500 appearances and countless titles later, including six La Liga and three Champions League trophies, Puyol’s relentless determination and leadership on the field have earned him a permanent place in Barcelona’s history books.Manchester United’s legendary winger, Ryan Giggs, reinvented himself multiple times over his 23-year career. With 963 appearances, Giggs holds the record for the most matches played for Manchester United and remains the only player to score in every Premier League season until his retirement.From a pacey winger to a composed playmaker, Giggs’s longevity and ability to adapt ensured that he remained a key figure in United’s dominance for over two decades.A true Liverpool icon, Jamie Carragher spent his entire career with the Reds, amassing 737 appearances. Known for his grit, versatility, and leadership, Carragher was the bedrock of Liverpool’s defence for nearly two decades.His contributions were crucial to the club’s success, including the 2005 Champions League triumph. His love for Liverpool remains strong, even after retirement, as he continues to serve as an ambassador for the club.Paul Scholes’s career at Manchester United was defined by his incredible vision, passing ability, and goal-scoring prowess. With 466 appearances, he was a midfield maestro, playing a pivotal role in the club's dominance during the 1990s and 2000s.Scholes’s humility and hard work earned him admiration from peers and fans alike, with even Zinedine Zidane calling him one of the best midfielders of his generation.A true symbol of post-war English football, Nat Lofthouse’s career at Bolton Wanderers spanned 14 years, during which he scored 255 goals in 452 league appearances.Known for his toughness and goal-scoring prowess, Lofthouse led Bolton to FA Cup glory in 1958, scoring both goals in the final. His commitment to the club extended beyond his playing days, serving as a coach, manager, and president of Bolton.These one-club men stand as icons of loyalty in a game where transfers dominate headlines. Their undying commitment to their clubs not only defines their legacies but also serves as an inspiration for future generations of footballers.Jimmy Dickinson’s loyalty to Portsmouth was unshakable, playing over 800 games for the club across 19 years. He helped Portsmouth win two league titles and remains the club's most-capped player.Known for his fair play and leadership, Dickinson’s dedication to the club extended to his post-playing career, where he managed Portsmouth and served on their board, solidifying his legacy as a Pompey great.Another AC Milan legend, Alessandro Costacurta played 663 matches for the Rossoneri, partnering with Baresi and Maldini to form one of the greatest defences in football history.Costacurta’s versatility and tactical intelligence helped Milan to seven Serie A titles and five Champions League victories. His loyalty to Milan spanned three decades, and even after his retirement, he remains an iconic figure at the club.A key figure in Leeds United’s success in the 1960s and 70s, Jack Charlton made 629 appearances for the club. Known for his uncompromising style, Charlton helped Leeds win the First Division title, the FA Cup, and the League Cup.His loyalty to Leeds was undeniable, and after his playing career, he achieved great success as the manager of the Republic of Ireland, but his legacy remains deeply rooted in Elland Road.","Paolo Maldini, Francesco Totti, Carles Puyol, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Tony Adams and Jack Charlton are some of the football legends who spent their entire careers at a single club. These one-club legends didn’t just play for the badge; they lived for it, becoming eternal icons.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113171600,imgsize-66850,width-400,resizemode-4/113171600.jpg"
Kemp FC make waves in KWL,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/kemp-fc-make-waves-in-kwl/articleshow/113169170.cms,"BENGALURU: After the formation of Kemp FC in 2022, the club has quickly made their mark in the women’s football landscape in Karnataka. After decent shows in the 2022 and 2023 editions of the Karnataka Women’s League (KWL), they agonisingly missed out on the 2024 title earlier this week after losing out on goal difference to defending champions Kickstart FC .It has, however, helped the team attain qualification in the Indian Women’s League 2 . The team management considers the runners-upfinish a big achievement after having rubbed shoulders with top teams, including Kickstart and Bengaluru FC “Of course, every club wants to win the championship. But, for a club that is just a few years old like ours and to battle against much more experienced sides, it (losing out on the title) is not a disappointment,"" said Samir Kamerkar, director and a founding member of the club.Kemp FC took shape after six parents, including five women, came together when their kids and other girls were on the verge of losing game time when a newly promoted Bengaluru-based club lacked the zeal and resources to push the squad into the Super Division league. “The girls in the team were in a state of lurch,” said club president Kathleen De Saran .Even when the same parents, who were pumping money for the club in the ‘A’ division, asked for ownership, it did not materialise. Exploring other options and opportunities, theygot news about another Super Division club, Bengaluru Braves , who were looking for a new owner. The enterprising parents latched on to the chance to attain ownership and rebranded Braves as Kemp FC.“We came together because we had this common goal and love for the sport and also at that moment, the immediate goal was to ensure that these girls had a team to play as they were a talented bunch of players. And our players did well in our maiden season, finishing second runners-up in the Super Division,” added Kathleen, one of the five women behind Kemp. The founding members of the club are mostly working IT professionals and entrepreneurs.Kemp FC, in the brief period, have managed to field women teams in A and B division too.Besides the goal to add to the trophy cabinet, one of their main objectives remains to promote and develop women’s football in the state. In the recently concluded KWL, 11 players from Karnataka were in the squad which also had talent from Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and North East.Having already established their presence with a top-2 finish and getting on to the national football scene, the new challenge for Kemp will be to keep improving and chasing more glory as they move up the ladder.","Kemp FC were formed in 2022 by six parents, including five women. The club finished second in the Karnataka Women's League (KWL) Kemp missed out on the 2024 title to defending champions Kickstart FC.

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner ’s 2024 US Open triumph on Sunday marked a major milestone in his tennis career, as he claimed his second Grand Slam title of the year.The 22-year-old Italian defeated Taylor Fritz in a straight-set victory, 6-3, 6-4, 7-5, ending a 21-year wait for an American male champion at the majors.Sinner’s historic win also made him the first Italian man to conquer the US Open, following his Australian Open success earlier in the year.Sinner’s rise in tennis is as unique as it is inspiring. However, before he was known for his powerful forehands and quick reflexes on the court, he was flying down the slopes of the Italian Alps .Growing up in the mountainous South Tyrol region, Sinner was a highly skilled skier, excelling in both slalom and giant slalom.His early years were spent mastering the art of skiing, competing in national junior events, and often securing first place in numerous competitions within his age category, where his balance and precision were key to his success.Skiing also instilled in him a strong mental focus, something that would later become an asset in his tennis career.At the age of 13, Sinner made a pivotal decision—choosing tennis over skiing. He relocated across Italy to train under the guidance of renowned coach Riccardo Piatti , in what proved to be a game-changing move.Piatti quickly recognized Sinner’s proactive, aggressive style, which stood out for someone so young. ""He hit the ball fast, always aiming to win the points,"" Piatti once remarked, noting that Sinner’s fearless mindset was a trait not commonly seen in junior players.Sinner himself credits his skiing background for shaping his mental approach to tennis. Just as in skiing, where each race lasts mere seconds and requires total focus, tennis demanded the same kind of short bursts of concentration.""In both skiing and tennis, he knows when to focus and when to relax,"" Piatti explained, drawing parallels between the two sports that have shaped Sinner’s rise.From being ranked 870th just two years ago to reaching the world number one spot in 2024, Sinner’s ascent has been meteoric. His calm under pressure and relentless drive to improve have made him a formidable force on the court.","Jannik Sinner is the first Italian man to win the US Open.

Roger Federer's achievements:

NEW DELHI: Roger Federer , the legendary tennis player with 20 Grand Slam titles , was warmly greeted by the audience at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Tuesday evening during the US Open quarterfinal match between Aryna Sabalenka and Zheng Qinwen .The Swiss icon, who retired in 2022 and played his final official match at Wimbledon the year before, acknowledged the crowd with a smile and a wave when he appeared on the stadium's videoboards.This marked Federer's first appearance at the US Open venue since his retirement. He holds the record for the most consecutive US Open championships, having secured five straight titles from 2004 to 2008.Additionally, he holds the record for the most consecutive weeks at No. 1 (237) in PIF ATP Rankings history (since 1973).During the ATP Masters 1000 Madrid final against Tomas Berdych , Federer demonstrated his keen observation skills and understanding of physics. In one rally, Federer noticed that the ball had bounced twice before Berdych made contact, a detail the chair umpire missed. Federer approached the umpire to discuss the incident.Roger Federer asked the chair umpire, ""Did you see the ball bounce towards me?""The umpire replied, ""Yeah, but to me, it looked like he came under with the racket.""Roger acknowledged what the umpire had to say and responded, ""Yeah, I know, but the ball came bouncing at me with topspin. The only way that happens is if he pushed it down into the court first.""The chair umpire clarified again, ""It looked like he just came under it. I probably missed it, but that’s how it appeared to me, Roger.""Roger replied, ""I agree it was close, but the result was obvious—he didn’t hit it the right way. Otherwise, the ball would’ve gone up in the air.""Despite Berdych's strong start, winning the first set with an impressive 14 winners and only two unforced errors, Federer managed to turn the match around in the second set. The Swiss maestro broke Berdych’s serve twice and capitalized on a double fault from the Czech player to secure the set.Berdych’s struggles continued in the third set, as he committed two more double faults, seemingly handing Federer a decisive lead at 5-3.However, Federer encountered a hiccup while serving for the match, allowing Berdych a brief reprieve. Nonetheless, Berdych found himself in trouble again in the 12th game, facing three championship points at 0-40.Although he managed to save all three, he ultimately succumbed to Federer’s pressure, hitting a forehand into the net to concede the match and the title to the Swiss champion.With 103 titles and 1,251 wins, Federer is second only to Connors' 109 titles and 1,274 wins in the Open Era.Remarkably, he never retired in 1,526 singles and 224 doubles matches throughout his career. Twenty-time Grand Slam champion owns all-time Grand Slam record with 369 wins and 58 QFs, as well as 10 finals, 23 SFs and 36 QFs in a row.Federer holds tournament records for the most titles at Basel (10), Halle (10), Wimbledon (8), and ATP Masters 1000 Cincinnati (7).His impressive achievements include a 41-match winning streak (2006-07), reaching 17 consecutive finals (2005-06), a 24-final winning streak (2003-05), 24 straight victories against Top 10 players (2003-05), and 65 consecutive wins on grass (2003-08).","Roger Federer was warmly greeted by the audience at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Tuesday evening during the US Open quarterfinal match between Aryna Sabalenka and Zheng Qinwen.

to Slam collection with victory over home hope

FUN FACT!

A flood of emotion hit Aryna Sabalenka as she fell on her back on the Arthur Ashe stadium . Her palms covered her face. The lines between reality and realization were happily smudged.In previous years, the powerful 26-year-old had come close at the US Open, on Saturday she wasn't thinking touching distance.A millimetre. A nanosecond. The Belarusian then held herself together - thunderbolt play and reined in emotions - against New Yorker Jessica Pegula . Sabalenka took leads and squandered advantages as the battling 30-year-old clawed back. In the second set, the world No.6 went from skidding to kicking 0-3 to 5-3 before Sabalenka, the WTA's hardcourt queen, powered to a 7-5, 7-5 win.The statuesque world No.2, on a 12-match winning streak, wrapped up a near perfect 27-1 run in the last four Slams on hardcourts, having also won the Australian Open last year and this year. ""So many things were going through my mind,"" Sabalenka said of the moment when she watched Pegula's forehand sail long on match point. ""All those tough losses in the past… I was so proud of myself and proud of my team that we were able to come back stronger and come back with better tennis.""""And now finally we are having this beautiful trophy. I don't know how to describe that feeling. You're crying, you're laughing, you feel all these emotions at the same time. That's the best feeling. I really wish everyone could experience that,"" she said.There were no flashbacks from last year for Sabalenka during the near two-hour final, save for when it was all done. ""I kept reminding myself that this is the final of the US Open, of course she's going to fight really hard for it and it's not going to be easy, and I have to work really hard to get it,"" the second seed said. ""In those tough moments, I was trying to stay strong, reminding myself that I have been through a lot and I'm strong enough to hold under this pressure.""If she gained cognizance of her victory when lying on her back on the Arthur Ashe stadium, the Belarusian, who had a complete makeover later in the evening for the champion's photo shoot, owned the silverware as she posed for photographs on the grounds. Sabalenka wore a high-slit sleeveless red dress that was accessorized by her beaming smile as she held the trophy close.The sky was dark and the lights burned bright. The only comparison on Saturday to Sabalenka's laugh, a clear, ringing sound, was her forehand, which according to Eurosport was struck at an average speed of 129 kmph, the fastest on both sides of the draw at the US Open. Sabalenka's shot is flatter, which accelerates the strike, taking her past Carlos Alcaraz' average of 127 kmph and Jannik Sinner's 126 kmph.The second seed - who has had to deal with some tragic reverses in the last few years, including losing her father Sergey to meningitis five years ago at the age of 43, and then her former boyfriend Konstantin Koltov, an ice hockey player, dying by suicide almost six months ago in March at the age of 42 - has waged a sturdy battle on and off the court.Tennis was Sabalenka's anchor during her tough days. ""After I lost my father, it's been my goal to put our family name in the history of tennis,"" she said. ""Every time I see my name on that trophy, I'm so proud of myself, I'm proud of my family that they never gave up on my dream and that they were doing everything they could to keep me going.""After her loss to American Coco Gauff last year she picked apart her predicament. ""The good news is that it's me against me,"" she had said. This time it was Aryna Sabalenka versus Jessica Pegula. There was a noisy full house under the roof, but the Belarusian was up and away. The gates in her head were locked.""I faced a lot of challenges on and off the court. Like being injured and not able to play Wimbledon . It was a new experience for me,"" she said. ""That's why it's very special, because no matter what I came back stronger. I never gave up on this dream.""Tennis fans in the city were introduced to Aryna Sabalenka's power packed game in Nov 2017 when, just 19, the Belarusian competed in and won the Mumbai Open, a WTA 125k event. It was the biggest title of her career at that point.",Aryna Sabalenka beats Jessica Pegula in US Open final. Belarusian has won last four Slams on hardcourts. World No.2 is on a 12-match winning streak. She lost her father to meningitis five years ago and her former boyfriend to suicide.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113179827,imgsize-49424,width-400,resizemode-4/113179827.jpg"

I feel like I almost let a lot of people down,"" admitted the 26-year-old Fritz.""I'm pretty just disappointed in how I played, how I hit certain shots. It sucks.""I just would have liked to have played better and given myself a better chance. It's really disappointing right now. I feel like American fans have been wanting a men's champion for a long time.""Fritz's pursuit of the championship match on Sunday was relentless, despite facing a setback when Sinner broke his serve as he attempted to close out the third set.Sinner capitalized on the opportunity, securing his second Grand Slam title of the season, following his breakthrough victory in Australia earlier this year.Fritz's achievement marked a significant milestone for American men's tennis, as he became the first US player to reach a Grand Slam final since Andy Roddick's appearance at Wimbledon in 2009. En route to the final, Fritz showcased his skills by overcoming higher-ranked opponents, including former runners-up Casper Ruud and Alexander Zverev.The two finalists, currently ranked 12th in the world, had previously faced each other on two occasions. Fritz emerged victorious in their initial encounter at Indian Wells in 2021, but Sinner exacted revenge when they met again in the California desert two years later.""The serve and the movement, massive improvements,"" said Fritz when asked to pinpoint the changes in Sinner's game.""I felt in 2021 I could get myself in points off of his first serve every time. Then it was much easier to hurt him from the ground, as well.""So he's much faster, a lot better out of the corners. His serve is really good now.""","Taylor Fritz feels he ""let a lot of people down"" by losing to Jannik Sinner in the US Open final. The 26-year-old was aiming to become the first American male tennis player to win a Grand Slam in over two decades.

The encounter showcased both players' exceptional tennis skills, but it was also marred by controversy and heated exchanges.The match took a dramatic turn after Medvedev won the first set, as he received a warning for making an obscene gesture towards the crowd.This incident triggered a series of outbursts from the Russian, who vehemently complained to the umpire , Jaume Campistol , about the alleged coaching Tsitsipas was receiving from his father and coach, Apostolos.During one exchange of conversation he was asking the umpire "" bro, are you mad? and his father can talk every point, bro are you stupid?"" He repeatedly asked the referee if his father can talk after every point.Medvedev's frustration escalated, and he even suggested that the umpire would be a coward if he failed to penalize Tsitsipas.

outlasts Tiafoe in five-set home matchup,

World No.1

awaits in final

Taylor Fritz , the top-ranked American, likes his chances against world No.1 Jannik Sinner in the US Open final. Fritz, ranked 12, will have the house with him when he looks to end the host nation's 21-year wait for a male Grand Slam singles champion.The 6 ft 5' Californian, armed with a whiplash serve, does a lot of things well on a tennis court, but recently he has sharpened his mental game.The 26-year-old's fight is in top gear as he showed against compatriot Frances Tiafoe in the semifinals where he rallied to claim a memorable 4-6, 7-5, 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 win late on Friday.Fritz teared up during the on-court interview when fellow pro Chris Eubanks reminded him that he would be playing for the title on Sunday. ""I get emotional when I'm happy. I cry at happy endings of movies,"" said Fritz. ""It's just joy, the crowd cheering and that realization, like wow, I'm in the final of the US Open. It's a lifelong dream come true.""Fritz had written a critical note to himself when he lost to Alexander Zverev in the third round at Wimbledon three years ago. 'Nobody in the whole world is underachieving harder than you, you are so f**king good, but 40 in the world,' Fritz wrote, underlining his ranking.Against Tiafoe, Fritz played a splendid waiting game. He knew if he was patient enough Tiafoe's level would drop, especially on the forehand side, and he would have the opening. ""I was waiting the whole third and fourth sets… When is it going to come? I'm drilling balls to his forehand, he's drilling them back, whipping me off the court, changing direction,"" Fritz said. ""Once he started making mistakes, started lifting the ball a little bit more, allowing me to attack more, it calmed me down.""The 26-year-old, who goes into the final with a 1-1 head-to-head record against Sinner, reckons there will be less pressure on him on Sunday. ""It was two Americans in the semifinals (on Friday), both of us wanted to be the guy to make it to the final. It's a stressful situation to be in,"" he said. ""I was the favourite, it's tough to go in with a 6-1 head-to-head record.""""That's different from playing the world No. 1 who you're probably not going to be the favorite against,"" he said. ""I've played well against Jannik. We're 1-1 (head-to-head). I typically play well against him.""Sinner, who ended Jack Draper 's breakthrough run in New York with 7-5, 7-6 (3), 6-2 win in a physical encounter, understands that he'll be up as much against Fritz as the Arthur Ashe stadium that will be packed to the rafters. ""He has a big serve. Very solid from the back of the court. He can hit strong. He can hit with rotation. He can mix up the game very well. He has played a lot this year, he has a lot of match rhythm,"" said Sinner, who took a tumble in the semifinals using his hands to cushion the impact of the fall.
