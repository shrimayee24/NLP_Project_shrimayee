NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali recently took a swipe at the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) after Pakistan's star batter Babar Azam retained his top spot in the ODI rankings .India's rising star Shubman Gill , who has recently struggled for runs but still occupies the third spot in the rankings, also came under fire from Basit.Basit expressed his surprise and scepticism, noting that Babar has not played an ODI since November 2023, yet continues to hold the number one position.The rankings, which place Babar ahead of Indian cricket stars Rohit Sharma , Shubman Gill, and Virat Kohli , sparked Basit's criticism.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Basit questioned the ICC’s ranking system and suggested that it might be a tactic to pressure Babar.""When I saw the ICC ranking (for ODI batters), Babar Azam was at the top, number two was Rohit Sharma, number three was Shubman Gill, and then there was Virat Kohli at number four. I did not find it necessary to read the remaining names because I couldn't see Travis Head and Rachin Ravindra. I think the ICC wants that Babar doesn't perform.

As India prepares for the

Paris Paralympics

, what message would you like to convey to the athletes?

With India having won a record 25 medals in Tokyo, do you believe they can exceed this achievement in Paris?

Who do you consider the top medal contenders for the Paris Paralympics?

As the most successful Paralympian with two gold and one silver in Javelin, how challenging is it to defend your title with so many expectations resting on you?

Do you think Neeraj faced significant pressure in his competition against Arshad Nadeem while defending his Tokyo gold?

With only one legal throw out of six, how would you assess Neeraj's performance in the final? What do you think went wrong?

Do you think Neeraj can win a gold medal in Los Angeles and join you as a three-time Olympic medalist?

Do you think losing the gold medal to an athlete from Pakistan will haunt Neeraj for a while?

NEW DELHI: The pressure was palpable on Neeraj Chopra 's face as he grabbed the javelin for his first throw in the Paris Olympics final. Having won gold at the Tokyo Games, Neeraj was aiming for another finish on top of the podium but eventually ended up winning the silver, finishing behind Pakistan's Arshad Nadeem , who claimed the gold in a thrilling men's javelin-throw final at the Stade de France earlier this month.Both Neeraj and Arshad started with foul throws in their opening attempts. However, when Nadeem returned for his second throw, he threw the spear a gigantic 92.97m far to set a new Olympic record and leave the crowd stunned.With the pressure mounting, Neeraj stepped up for his second throw. After a confident stretch and shoulder roll, he marked his season-best distance of 89.45 meters. But it remained his best throw of the final, and thus behind Nadeem's.Neeraj's last four throws were red-flagged as fouls.Three-time Paralympic medallist and the current president of the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI), Devendra Jhajharia , believes Neeraj striving to throw beyond 93 meters led to the four fouls.In an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com, Jhajharia discussed Neeraj's silver-medal finish, the upcoming Paralympic Games, and much more ...A large contingent of 84 athletes is heading to Paris, representing India. I'm in regular touch with each of them, encouraging them to stay focused on delivering their best performance and not to let the pressure get to them. I urge them to play to the best of their abilities and make India proud.We delivered historic performances in Tokyo, and for the Paralympics this time, I feel our athletes have prepared very well. The Khelo India scheme has also benefited the players. They are training in centers with a special focus on the Paralympics podium this time. The players have been preparing for this for a long time. When I won a medal in Tokyo and returned, within one and a half months I received a call from the Sports Authority of India asking where I would like to train for the Paris Olympics. Considering all of this, I can confidently say that we will win more than 25 medals this time because we have prepared very well.Our athletes are in excellent form in shooting, badminton, archery and many other sports. We have individuals like Sumit, who have broken world records. We also have many other highly skilled players.It's a challenge because everyone expects you to win a medal based on previous success, but each day is a new beginning for athletes. Injuries can occur, and performance can fluctuate. I believe one should give their best, and I convey the same message to the players: just give your best.Whenever any player performs well, I don’t pressure them. Neeraj's father told me he had an injury, but he still did his best. He threw over 89 meters. I am so happy with his performance. The other athlete, Arshad Nadeem, also gave his best.When Nadeem threw 92.97 meters, there was, of course, pressure on Neeraj. He threw over 89 meters. In his remaining four attempts, Neeraj wanted to throw over 93 meters. Neeraj knew he had already thrown over 89 meters and was in second position, and another 89-meter throw wouldn't have made any difference. He wanted to throw over 93 meters and put in extra effort so that he could beat Nadeem. His extra effort resulted in four fouls. For outstanding performances, you need to put in extra effort.I have seen Neeraj grow up. I have also trained with him. He is a very passionate sportsperson. He is crazy about javelin. He is so focused, very humble. I am sure he is going to make a hat-trick of Olympic medals in Los Angeles.I don't think there is anything like that. There are over 200 countries that participate in the Olympics. They compete under the same roof. We need to respect each other as sports persons. The Olympics is a big stage, and we need to respect every aspect of it. Neeraj has won a medal, and we are all proud of him.After his Paris Olympics campaign, Neeraj Chopra has confirmed that he will be competing at the Lausanne Diamond League later this month.",Devendra Jhajharia is the current president of the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) Neeraj Chopra won silver in the men's javelin at the Paris Paralympics.

The pacer is likely to represent his state team, Bengal , in the upcoming Ranji Trophy matches, PTI reported.According to sources, Shami is set to feature in at least one of Bengal's initial Ranji fixtures, either against UP on October 11 in an away game or versus Bihar in Kolkata on October 18.However, considering the short two-day gap between the matches, it is improbable that he will participate in both encounters.The speedster's return to domestic cricket could potentially pave the way for his international comeback, with a possible appearance in one of the Test matches against New Zealand later this year.The Test series against New Zealand kicks off on October 19 in Bengaluru, with additional matches scheduled in Pune on October 24 and Mumbai on November 1. Shami is anticipated to participate in one of these games before heading to Australia for the major tour.Shami, 34, one of India's premier fast bowlers, last represented the national team in the ODI World Cup final against Australia in Ahmedabad on November 19 of the previous year.Since then, Shami has not played any competitive matches due to undergoing ankle surgery in the United Kingdom in February of this year, which ruled him out for at least six months.Although there are Instagram videos showing Shami beginning his Return To Play (RTP) routines at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru, where he has been bowling with a shortened run-up and at low intensity, there were reports suggesting he might be available for the Duleep Trophy.However, it has been determined that Shami is unlikely to be fit for the Duleep Trophy, and the selectors are cautious about rushing his return prematurely.The priority is to ensure that India's leading pace trio - Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, and Mohammed Siraj - are fully fit for the five-Test series in Australia.To date, Shami has taken 229 wickets in 64 Tests, including six five-wicket hauls and 12 four-wicket hauls.","Mohammed Shami is expected to return to competitive cricket after ankle surgery.

Trials will be held across 55 cities in five zones starting in October, with provisions for additional camps in cities not included in the initial list.Tendulkar highlighted the need to balance advantages between batsmen and bowlers in the league, which features unique rules like the ""50-50"" and awarding nine runs for specific shots.""If we are giving some advantage to the batsmen then the bowlers also need to get in the game,"" Tendulkar said.He emphasized that introducing reverse swing using taped tennis balls would test batsmen's technique, adding, ""During my playing days, I used to tape the ball up from one side. In season (leather) balls, we look for the shiny and the rough side and in the tennis ball, we would apply tape on one side and I used to practice reverse swing to face it in international cricket. I thought why not introduce it in this format and if this is implemented then the batter's technique will also be tested.""Initially, bowlers in the ISPL were unaccustomed to bowling with taped balls and generating reverse swing, leading to inconsistencies in line and length. Tendulkar addressed this by conducting workshops with coaches, noting, ""The first thing they needed to learn was to think about the release point and the place between point A and B - I'll call it A plus - you target that and the ball will undoubtedly go to the batter.""He stressed the significance of bowlers trusting their instincts and aiming for a specific spot rather than focusing solely on the batsman, especially when dealing with reverse swing. This adjustment, according to Tendulkar, was crucial for bowlers to regain control and utilize the taped ball effectively.","Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar introduces reverse swing to tennis-ball tournament.

Meanwhile, Bologna, who surprised everyone last season, settled for a 1-1 draw with Udinese.In the second half at the Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi, Verona's new signings Dailon Livramento and Daniel Mosquera found the back of the net, handing Conte a disastrous start to his league campaign with his new club.During a press conference on Saturday, Conte referred to this season as ""year zero"" following Napoli's disappointing 10th-place finish as defending champions in the previous campaign, which saw them cycle through three different coaches.The 55-year-old also cautioned fans against having high expectations while he awaits reinforcements and deals with the situation surrounding Victor Osimhen, the star of the 2023 title triumph, who has been sidelined for pushing for a transfer.Despite Napoli being the superior team in the first half, the injury to their key player Khvicha Kvaratskhelia just before halftime proved to be a turning point in the match.Kvaratskhelia's chance to break the deadlock was thwarted by a last-ditch tackle from Jackson Tchatchoua, and the Georgian star was subsequently injured by Pawel Dawidowicz.Napoli's attacking threat diminished in Kvaratskhelia's absence, and Verona capitalized four minutes into the second half when Livramento deftly converted Darko Lazovic's precise cross.Napoli nearly equalized on the hour mark when Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa's powerful shot ricocheted off the crossbar.Mosquera, making his debut, sealed the victory for Verona 15 minutes later after a midfield scramble ended with the Colombian surging forward and calmly slotting the ball past Alex Meret. In stoppage time, Mosquera further compounded Napoli and Conte's misery by tapping in Lazovic's low pass, having been left completely unmarked.In their inaugural match under newly appointed coach Vincenzo Italiano, Bologna faced a setback as Lautaro Giannetti's header in the 68th minute secured a draw for Udinese.Giannetti, the Argentine player, found the back of the net just moments after Florian Thauvin's penalty was saved by Bologna's goalkeeper, Lukasz Skorupski. Bologna had taken a well-deserved lead in the 57th minute through Riccardo Orsolini's successful spot-kick.Despite the disappointing outcome, Bologna showcased the same energy and style of play that characterized their performance last season under Thiago Motta's leadership, which had led them to qualify for the modern Champions League for the first time in the club's history.The spotlight now shifts to the capital city, where rivals Roma and Lazio are set to commence their respective campaigns.

Their Brazilian attacking duo combined brilliantly to open the scoring, with Vinicius laying the ball off for Rodrygo, who bent a shot into the far corner, beyond the reach of Greif.Although Greif managed to parry another attempt from Rodrygo and Mbappe missed the target, Madrid maintained their pressure but failed to extend their lead.Arrasate instructed his team to remain focused until the interval, and they followed his orders, effectively neutralizing Real Madrid's star-studded lineup.Before halftime, Muriqi nearly scored for the home side, while the tenacious defender Pablo Maffeo received a yellow card for a rough tackle on Vinicius.Early in the second half, Mallorca equalized when the strong Kosovo striker Muriqi powerfully headed the ball into the net from Dani Rodriguez's corner kick.Greif made a low save from Mbappe at his near post, and Vinicius blasted the ball over the crossbar as Ancelotti's team tried to regain the lead.In an effort to create more attacking fluidity against Mallorca's deep-lying defence, Ancelotti substituted veteran midfielder Luka Modric, who will turn 39 in September, for defensive midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni.Mbappe had another chance, but Greif denied him once more, and Johan Mojica cleared the rebound to safety before Rodrygo could reach it.",Real Madrid held to 1-1 draw by Real Mallorca in La Liga opener.

Cincinnati Open: Angry Carlos Alcaraz out after 'worst match',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/cincinnati-open-angry-carlos-alcaraz-out-after-worst-match/articleshow/112579416.cms,"NEW DELHI: In what he dubbed the ""worst match"" of his career, Carlos Alcaraz lost 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 on Friday at the ATP and WTA Cincinnati Open and vented his displeasure with a forceful racquet smash.The 37-year-old French opponent Gael Monfils , a formidable opponent for any young gun with two decades of experience in the game, proved too formidable for the reigning Roland Garros and Wimbledon champion, as per AFP.""It was the worst match that I ever played in my career,"" Alcaraz said. ""I couldn't play.""I don't know what happened. Honestly, I couldn't, I couldn't control myself. I couldn't be better. It was impossible to win, and that's all.""The Spaniard added: ""I came here thinking I'm going to feel good. I'm going to put in a good tennis, because I know how to play on this court.""Alcaraz claimed that this match was the first time he had ever broken a racquet out of rage.The 2023 Cincinnati runner-up and current ATP number three is without a hardcourt victory going into next Monday's US Open, having only played one second-round summer cement match thus far.""It's really difficult to find some goodstuffs from this match -- I want to forget it and try to move on to New York,"" he said.""I'll try to practice well, to get used to those courts. And I will forget this match.""As the disgruntled number two seed was furious with his performance and would sometimes yell at his group, world number one Jannik Sinner quietly celebrated turning twenty-three, with a walkover as a gift from fate.Due to a rib injury, the Australian opponent Jordan Thompson withdrew prior to their match, allowing the Italian to proceed through to the quarterfinals with ease.The quarterfinal match that Sinner lost to Andrey Rublev in Canada last week will be rematched. After a rain-shortened encounter, the Russian defeated Brandon Nakashima 7-6 (7/5), 6-1.Alexander Zverev , the fifth seed, defeated Pablo Carreno Busta of Spain 7-5, 7-6 (8/6), advancing him to the round of eight.Felix Auger-Aliassime defeated seventh seed Casper Ruud 6-3, 6-1 in 68 minutes, extending the Norwegian's bad run of play. The Canadian hit 14 aces in the victory.Iga Swiatek , the top-seeded woman, easily defeated Marta Kostyuk 6-2, 6-2 to advance to the quarterfinals for the second time this season.The Pole is currently 3-0 in the rivalry without dropping a set after backing up her victory against the Ukrainian at Indian Wells in March of last year.Swiatek entered the court without following her customary warm-up regimen due to the rainy morning, but she appeared unaffected.After having to battle through three sets to defeat Varvara Gracheva in the previous round, Swiatek was able to wrap up the match with ease.In thirty-one minutes, Swiatek won the first set, and she breezed through the second.""I'm happy that I kept my intensity, in the first match, it got a little bit down,"" Swiatek said. ""But I was ready in every game.""I'm happy I was solid. I was disciplined with all the things that I wanted to take care of.""The number one added: ""I don't really care what my result is going to be here, just trying to do the work.""In her fourth quarterfinal at Cincinnati, third seed and three-time semifinalist Aryna Sabalenka defeated Monfils's wife, Elina Svitolina, 7-5, 6-2.The sixth seed Jessica Pegula defeated 2023 runner-up Karolina Muchova 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 in a postponed second-round match.Mother of two Caroline Wozniacki lost to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 7-5, 6-4 while continuing her WTA comeback attempt.Magdalena Frech of Poland lost to Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen 6-1, 7-5.
