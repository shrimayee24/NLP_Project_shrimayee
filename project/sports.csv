Trey Lyles: Another Viable Option

What’s Next for Golden State?

Theare actively scouting alternatives as veteran Al Horford considers retirement and restricted free agent Jonathan Kuminga remains unsigned. With Kevon Looney’s departure to the New Orleans Pelicans, Golden State faces mounting pressure to reinforce its frontcourt—and one name rising to the top is 2-time NBA championThe Golden State Warriors have been eyeing 39-year-old Al Horford as a replacement for Looney, hoping his experience and leadership can help stabilize the team’s interior defense. However, Kuminga’s unresolved contract situation has complicated the process. Golden State is hesitant to finalize any deals before resolving Kuminga’s holdout, which has become a key bottleneck in their offseason plans.ClutchPoints insider Brett Siegel shed light on the situation: “The main reason Horford and Melton, or any other player, have yet to sign with the Warriors is because of Kuminga’s holdout,” Siegel wrote Friday. (H/t: Sporting News)Horford’s uncertain status, with retirement reportedly on the table, adds another layer of complexity. If Horford chooses to walk away from the game or sign elsewhere, the Golden State Warriors are already considering contingency plans.Should Horford opt out, the Golden State Warriors have two primary candidates lined up:1. Chris Boucher2. Trey LylesWhile both are currently waiting in free agency, Golden State seems to be the only team linked to Al Horford at this stage, especially after the conclusion of Summer League.Chris Boucher stands out as a high-upside option due to his offensive versatility.The 32-year-old forward, listed at 6-foot-9, has steadily grown into a modern NBA big man with a reliable shooting stroke and solid ball-handling ability.Boucher’s shooting range and agility could make him an ideal fit for the Warriors’ motion-heavy offense. He isn’t known for defensive dominance like Horford, but his ability to space the floor would complement Stephen Curry and help create more driving lanes and scoring opportunities.Trey Lyles, a 10-year veteran, is also in the conversation. Known for his catch-and-shoot ability, Lyles would give the Golden State Warriors a different type of offensive tool—less dynamic off the dribble but more suited for spot-up shooting.Still, between the two, Boucher’s all-around skillset may align better with Golden State’s system.As Golden State navigates this turbulent offseason, the franchise must first resolve Kuminga’s holdout before making any major roster decisions. But in the event that Horford declines their offer or retires, fans should expect swift movement on Boucher or Lyles.Brett Siegel summed it up best: “Until Horford signs, these two are forced to wait in free agency.”Also read: NBA Free Agency Rumors: New York Knicks predicted to land $50 million Orlando Magic star to boost bench depth and improve title odds The clock is ticking, and the Golden State Warriors are clearly not sitting idle.

Potential Impact: A New Big Three in Dallas?

A Second Blockbuster Between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Dallas Mavericks?

A blockbuster NBA trade proposal is turning heads across the league, as reports suggestcould be on the move to the. The potential deal, first highlighted by Bleacher Report’s Eric Pincus, would form a seismic three-team swap involving the Los Angeles Lakers , Dallas Mavericks, and Brooklyn Nets. LeBron James , now nearly 41, has been the cornerstone of the Lakers for years, averaging 27 points per game throughout his career. The idea of moving the four-time NBA champion might sound unthinkable. But with 25-year-old Luka Dončić already producing Hall of Fame-caliber numbers, the Lakers may finally be tempted to reshape their roster around the young Slovenian star.According to Pincus, “The initial assumption is Dallas views James, even at almost 41, as the viable option to propel the franchise into upper-echelon contention. The cost is depth.”Dallas could be betting big on LeBron, not just for what he brings on the court, but for the championship pedigree he brings to any locker room. And with Kyrie Irving already on the roster—his former championship partner from Cleveland—a reunion could ignite serious title contention.The reported trade would see an extensive player swap between the three franchises. Here’s a clear breakdown of who gets what:Here’s a quick rundown of the motivations behind each team’s involvement:• Acquire LeBron and Bronny James, giving them star power and massive media attention.• Pair LeBron with Kyrie Irving again—a duo that already has a championship under their belt.• Add LeBron’s championship experience to mentor Luka Dončić.• Offload LeBron’s salary and begin a new era centered around Luka Dončić.• Receive young, athletic talent and picks to retool around Anthony Davis.• Acquire a reliable defensive big man in Daniel Gafford and versatile wings in Martin and Washington.• Gain valuable rotation players and young prospects as they continue their rebuild.• Offload salary while acquiring promising talent like Knecht and Prosper.If the deal materializes, it would not only reunite LeBron and Kyrie Irving, but also create an imposing trio alongside Luka Dončić. The Mavericks would arguably become instant contenders in the Western Conference, while the Lakers could usher in a youth-focused retool with a longer window of success.As Eric Pincus explains, “Dallas would be making a bold move, but James remains one of the league’s top NBA stars.”It wouldn’t be the first time the Dallas Mavericks and the Los Angeles Lakers have collaborated on a high-stakes deal. Less than a year ago, the two franchises completed one of the biggest trades in recent NBA history. This new proposal could be the follow-up that changes the NBA landscape once again.Also read: Milwaukee Bucks’ Bold Three-Team Trade Proposal Could Land $160,000,000 Portland Trail Blazers Superstar to Support the Greek Freak While nothing is official yet, the proposed trade has ignited serious debate. Trading LeBron James is no small decision—he’s not just a player, but a generational icon. But with Luka Dončić ascending and the Los Angeles Lakers needing to reimagine their future, it might just be the move that reshapes multiple franchises for years to come.","A blockbuster NBA trade proposal is turning heads across the league, as reports suggestcould be on the move to the Dallas Mavericks.

What is Stephen Curry’s net worth in 2025?

What is Stephen Curry’s contract value for the 2024-2025 season?

Will Stephen Curry retire in 2026?

After WNBA players staged a quiet yet powerful demonstration on All-Star game day to demand pay equal to NBA stars, Stephen Curry has jumped into the salary debate by saying that ‘NBA stars are underpaid’. He appeared on the podcast, 360 with Speedy, and made the startling comment while discussing the topic of player salary in the NBA.Stephen Curry was of the view that the NBA players’ salaries don’t reflect the value the players create. He said the players' salaries are far less as compared to teams’ soaring valuations. While the issue of pay disparity among NBA and WNBA players is already heating up, the latest comment from the Golden State Warriors has opened everyone’s eyes to a fact ignored to date.Stephen Curry is all set to take home about $60 million in salary in the upcoming season. However, he doesn’t think the figure is justified. He raised the issue of NBA players being underpaid during his recent appearance on a podcast and said:""I think, because of the way the CBA is structured right now, we can't participate in equity. And that's a big deal because it is a partnership with ownership. It's a partnership with the league, and we're on the short term of that revenue.”He elaborated, ""Those (contract) numbers sound crazy, but what the league is doing, from whatever era you want to compare it to, to now, is probably 10x that. The idea that we can't participate in equity while we're playing is part of why I would say yes, we are underpaid, because we want to be able to participate in that rise.”""Hopefully, sooner than later, those rules change a little bit so that players can participate more in the upside of team equity, the league, valuations, and all that type of stuff. Just because I think we deserve it.""His comment has definitely pinpointed the glaring issue in the NBA and may kickstart serious discussions on restructuring the CBA.During the podcast where Stephen Curry appeared, he spoke on various topics. In one of the sections, the host, Speedy Morman, asked if the speculations that his net worth is about $240 million are true. To this, Curry said that he was not sure and that he didn’t care. He swiftly diverted the discussion to present contracts of various players, which are now in the supermax category. Taking the discussion further, the host asked if Curry thought that the players were underpaid. Curry said yes and went on to explain his viewpoint.The NBA players, on average, took home $12 million in the 2024-2025 season. A few NBA stars are some of the richest athletes on Forbes’ list. Still, according to Curry, there is room for improvement in the CBA structure, which can result in improved salaries for the NBA players.The discussions around NBA and WNBA players' pay disparity have already heated up. Recently, Shaquille O'Neal backed WNBA stars and said that their salaries are outright unjustified. WNBA stars wore 'Pay us what you owe us' t-shirts on the All-Star game day to voice their demand for pay equal to NBA players. According to various media reports, WNBA star Caitlin Clark's game tickets were priced at $41, and she was being considered the biggest crowd-puller before she had to sit on bench due to injury.Stephen Curry’s net worth in 2025 is estimated at $240 million, per Celebrity Net Worth.Stephen Curry’s contract value stands at $59,606,817.No, Stephen Curry will not retire in 2026.Also Read: 10 wealthiest NBA stars in 2025 - Updated Net Worth, Current Occupation and More",Stephen Curry spoke about NBA players’ salaries and said they are underpaid.

Poll Do you think Vanessa Bryant handled the pregnancy rumors well? Yes, very cleverly No, she should have addressed them directly

Met Gala Surprise: Rihanna Stuns With Baby Bump Reveal, A$AP Rocky Confirms It’s Baby No 3

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Natalia Bryant stepped into the fashion world just like her mother, officially joining IMG Models in 2021 at the age of 18. “Ever since I can remember, I wanted to model,” she shared in a statement posted by IMG on Instagram. “There is a lot to learn, but I feel this is a great opportunity for me to learn and express myself creatively.”Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip. After the viral response via memes, Vanessa has seemingly closed the chapter as she did not extend the matter any further with any other comments about it afterwards.Days after shutting down the pregnancy rumor, Vanessa Bryant made a glowing courtside appearance with her daughters at the New York Liberty vs. Chicago Sky game. The WNBA shared a sweet clip showing Vanessa alongside Natalia, 22, Bianka, 8, and Capri, 5, all smiling and waving for the camera.Later, Vanessa uploaded an image of her in a restaurant, candidly posing as she waited for the food to be arrive. Considering the dress, it appears that the photograph was shot after her recent attendance in the game.Their family moment quickly caught fans’ attention online, adding a warm highlight to the evening. It was a rare and heartwarming public outing for the Bryant family, showing their strong support for women’s basketball. It was Vanessa's first public outing since she debunked the horrendous pregnancy rumors.Recently, Vanessa honored her husband Kobe's memory with a heartfelt Instagram post on Instagram, sharing a throwback photograph of the family with the NBA legend, ""Happy Fathers Day @kobebryant 💕 You are so missed.

It comes after several touching family updates, including daughter Natalia’s recent USC graduation and emotional tribute to her dad.As for her fortune, Vanessa's net worth has seen major growth over the years. While Kobe Bryant’s NBA success helped build their fortune, Vanessa carved her own path, too.

Her 13-year-old son Benjamin, whom she shares with NFL great Tom Brady, faced bullying in Boston simply for being Brady’s son, following a youth baseball game.The revelation offered a rare glimpse into the emotional cost of growing up with a last name that carries immense expectations, especially in a city like Boston where Tom Brady is practically royalty.

Isaiah Crawford brings shooting and grit to the Houston Rockets' revamped rotation

Houston Rockets get strategic with roster flexibility and youth development



FAQs

Who is Isaiah Crawford?

What is a two-way contract in the NBA?

Can Isaiah Crawford play in the NBA Playoffs?

The Houston Rockets are not slowing down. Fresh off one of their most aggressive offseason in recent years— headlined by the blockbuster trade for Kevin Durant— the team has made another calculated move. In a bid to fortify its roster depth, Houston has signed forward Isaiah Crawford, formerly with the Sacramento Kings, to a two-way contract. The addition comes as the Rockets prepare to launch a serious campaign in the 2025–26 NBA season.Isaiah Crawford may not be a household name just yet, but his resume in the G League and flashes of promise with Sacramento offer reasons for optimism. The 6-foot-6 forward went undrafted in 2024 out of Louisiana Tech, yet quickly earned a two-way deal with the Kings. His time with the Stockton Kings, Sacramento’s G League affiliate, was productive, highlighted by a championship run in 2025, where Crawford proved to be a key contributor.In 37 G League games, Crawford averaged 13.0 points, 5.3 rebounds, 2.5 assists, 1.3 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game. More importantly, his shooting splits were stellar: 47.3% from the field, 39.9% from three, and nearly 79% from the free-throw line.These numbers weren’t lost on Houston’s front office.NBA insider Michael Scotto reported, “The Houston Rockets and Isaiah Crawford agreed to a two-way deal, sources told @hoopshype. Crawford averaged 13.3 points on 50.2% from the field and 44.7% from 3-point range, 5.6 rebounds, 2.5 assists, 1.2 blocks and 1.2 steals in the G League. Agent Andre Buck completed the deal.”Crawford’s arrival comes at a time when Houston is leveraging every asset available. With a hard cap at the first apron, the team is creatively rounding out its depth using two-way contracts. Alongside Crawford, the Rockets also signed JD Davison— 2025 G League MVP and former Boston Celtics guard— to a two-way deal.With Crawford and Davison, plus Kevon Harris already occupying the team’s three two-way slots, Houston has maxed out its developmental resources. Though players on two-way deals can only appear in up to 50 NBA games and are ineligible for playoff action unless converted to standard contracts, their role in a long regular season is vital.Crawford's versatility and defensive activity give him an edge as a 3-and-D contributor, something playoff teams desperately covet. Even if he spends significant time with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers— Houston’s G League affiliate— he’s now within reach of valuable minutes if injuries or rotation tweaks arise.Now, with Kevin Durant anchoring the top of the rotation, the focus shifts to finding under-the-radar contributors who can hold their own. Crawford fits that mold.Also Read: Dwyane Wade’s wife Gabrielle Union reveals their daughter Kaavia is obsessed with marriage amid their vacation getaway By targeting high-upside players with two-way deals, Houston’s front office continues to walk the line between win-now ambition and long-term sustainability. And it is a strategy that could make them one of the West’s most complete teams by season’s end.Isaiah Crawford is a 6'6"" forward from Louisiana Tech who played with the Sacramento Kings before joining the Houston Rockets.A two-way contract allows a player to split time between the NBA team and its G League affiliate, with a 50-game NBA limit.Not unless the Houston Rockets convert his two-way contract into a standard NBA deal.","The Houston Rockets have signed forward Isaiah Crawford to a two-way contract.

In a move aimed at deepening their offseason roster and evaluating young talent, the Los Angeles Lakers have officially signed four undrafted rookies—guards RJ Davis and Augustas Marciulionis, and forwards Eric Dixon and Arthur Kaluma—on Exhibit 10 contracts. The signings were confirmed by the team via Twitter on July 26, 2025.These additions offer the Los Angeles Lakers a chance to assess promising prospects during training camp, with flexibility to convert deals depending on performance.Exhibit 10 contracts are one-year, non-guaranteed deals that can be converted into two-way contracts before the start of the regular season. These contracts also offer players bonuses of up to $75,000 if they are waived and spend at least 60 days with the team’s G League affiliate.In this case, all four players are candidates to potentially earn a two-way slot with the Los Angeles Lakers or bolster the South Bay Lakers’ roster.Eric Dixon stands out among the group not just for his scoring prowess but also for how his contract situation unfolded. Ranked 44th on ESPN’s draft board, Dixon surprisingly went undrafted despite leading NCAA Division I in scoring during the 2024–25 season.The 6-foot-8 forward also earned third-team All-American honors and was expected by many to receive a two-way contract.However, as reported by The Athletic’s Dan Woike, a foot injury kept Dixon out of Summer League play, likely influencing the team’s decision to start him on an Exhibit 10 deal instead. Still, his contract allows for potential conversion before the season begins.RJ Davis brings leadership and scoring to the Los Angeles Lakers’ backcourt options. The 6-foot guard earned ACC Player of the Year honors in 2023–24 and returned as a super-senior for North Carolina in 2024–25.• 17.2 points per game• 3.6 assists per gameDavis has shown he can score at multiple levels and create plays under pressure, making him a potential backup guard option if he proves himself in training camp.A 6-foot-4 floor general, Augustas Marciulionis is a two-time WCC Player of the Year and one of the most well-rounded guards in mid-major basketball last season.His international experience and consistency as a playmaker could help him stand out as a viable G League contributor or emergency call-up.Arthur Kaluma, a 6-foot-7 wing, arrives with a solid résumé across multiple college programs, including Creighton, Texas State, and Texas. In his final NCAA season with the Longhorns, Kaluma delivered across the board.His ability to guard multiple positions and contribute offensively makes him a potential sleeper among the Los Angeles Lakers’ Exhibit 10 signings.While all four signings were expected, given earlier reports following the 2025 NBA Draft, Eric Dixon’s deal was the only mild surprise, as many had anticipated a two-way agreement. As Luke Adams of Hoops Rumors noted, “reporting last month suggested that Dixon would get a two-way contract — instead, he has joined the team on an Exhibit 10 deal.”With training camp on the horizon, these rookies now face a crucial window to prove their value. Exhibit 10 deals may seem like a low-commitment investment from the team, but they provide a real opportunity for undrafted players to break into the NBA system.If any of these players shine in camp, the Los Angeles Lakers could flip the Exhibit 10 into a two-way deal—or even consider a regular-season roster spot.Also read:With these moves, the Lakers aren’t just filling out training camp slots—they’re investing in high-upside talent with paths to the NBA.","The Los Angeles Lakers have officially signed four undrafted rookies on Exhibit 10 contracts.

No Trade Talks — But A Free Agency Pivot?

Mavericks’ Current Stance:

has exercised his $52.6 million player option to remain with thefor the 2025-26 season. However, a recent report has stirred speculation around his future, suggesting that the four-time NBA champion might still be entertaining the idea of joining the Dallas Mavericks.According to NBA insider Marc Stein, James has “genuine curiosity” about potentially making the move to Dallas. While no formal trade talks are underway, the Mavericks remain an intriguing landing spot — both because of the familiar faces on the roster and the organization’s recent moves to bolster its championship aspirations.At age 40, LeBron James remains one of the league’s most impactful players. While his commitment to the Lakers for the upcoming season is solid on paper, Stein’s report points to deeper emotional and relational ties that make Dallas an attractive alternative.• Kyrie Irving – Former Cavaliers teammate with whom James won the 2016 title.• Anthony Davis – Recently traded to the Mavericks in a blockbuster deal.• Klay Thompson – Four-time Finals opponent, now part of the Mavericks.• Nico Harrison – Former Nike executive and now Mavericks GM; has a longstanding relationship with James.• Jason Kidd – Mavericks head coach and assistant during James’ 2020 Lakers title run.• Frank Vogel – Former Lakers head coach, currently an assistant in Dallas.Stein writes, “The Mavericks would seem to be uniquely suited to offer that with so many people in Dallas he already knows well.”Add to that the Mavericks’ acquisition of 2025 No. 1 overall draft pick Cooper Flagg, and the team presents a compelling blend of youth and experience that could attract a veteran like James. The Lakers , for their part, appear to be building their future around Luka Doncic , who was acquired midseason in a massive trade involving Anthony Davis, Max Christie, and a 2029 first-round pick. This move signaled a potential shift in priorities — possibly opening the door for James to explore new options.While the Lakers achieved a solid regular season record, their early playoff exit may factor into James’ consideration for a new challenge.Despite the mutual interest, Stein clarified that the Mavericks are not currently pursuing a trade for James. The 21-time All-Star’s expiring contract and upcoming 41st birthday are key reasons for the team’s reluctance to offer up significant rotation players.• Not pursuing a trade for James.• Open to signing James if he becomes a free agent or reaches a buyout.• Reluctant to give up core rotation players for a short-term addition.“As I’ve been reporting for weeks: They have not tried to trade for him and do not want to try to trade for him if it means surrendering multiple rotation pillars for a player who turns 41 in December,” wrote Marc Stein.Still, a buyout seems unlikely. James continues to hold significant on-court and off-court value for the Lakers — making it hard to envision the team letting him walk without any return.Stein adds, “Do you think the Lakers will just give up on this season and buy him out in August or September and set James up to walk to Dallas or Golden State or New York? I don’t.”As it stands, LeBron James is locked in for at least another season in Los Angeles. But Dallas remains a team to watch. With several close allies and a winning infrastructure, the Mavericks could offer the kind of late-career comfort and championship potential that might ultimately draw James away from Hollywood — if not now, then maybe in 2026.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Milwaukee Bucks Eyeing $28 Million Brooklyn Nets Star Following Contract Rejection For now, it’s speculation.

?

As NFL training camps kick off across the country, excitement soars for fans gearing up for fantasy leagues and regular-season action. But behind the scenes, a different kind of storm brews—this one among the wives and girlfriends of players who suddenly find their lives flipped upside down. Rochelle Searight, wife of San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk, has become the unexpected voice of this under-the-radar reality.In a candid and humorous TikTok, Rochelle peeled back the curtain on what life looks like when an NFL season revs up. “Why do all the wives and girlfriends [of NFL players] go into a frenzy when their men report for training camp?” she asked. “Why is everybody online complaining? Let me give y’all some of these details on training camp and why everybody’s in a panic.”For many, training camp isn't just about players sweating it out on the field. It's also about emotional labor, solo parenting, and the sudden vacuum left by partners who must report for duty with strict schedules and even stricter curfews. “Training camp does last for multiple weeks and the women freak out because — so in my situation, I’m a mother. Now he has to abruptly leave, and [I’m] taking care of my rambunctious four-year-old by myself, who has never slept, and he is off the walls,” Rochelle admitted.The chaos intensifies for WAGs who don’t live in the team's city. “The wives and girlfriends who are back home now have to get left and [their significant other] have to go report to work, go to camp. I get to see my husband every few days, they don’t get to see their man at all for like weeks,” she said, highlighting the long-distance strain.Rochelle also brought attention to the emotional rollercoaster of NFL job security. “Some of the men are not guaranteed a spot yet, they are fighting for their spot on the team. So if they don’t make this team and they end up on a different team, the family has to pack up and move. It’s just a lot,” she shared.With social media as a coping mechanism, she clarified, “No, our men aren’t our whole personality people. It just gives us a fun thing to look forward to. It’s just content.”Fortunately, stability may be on the horizon for the Aiyuks. After tense negotiations, Brandon signed a $120 million extension with the 49ers, although he’s still recovering from a torn ACL.

3. Has Tom Brady responded to Gisele Bündchen’s stalking accusations ?



Nearly a year after their high-profile divorce, Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady’s past continues to make waves online—especially after a now-infamous set of paparazzi photos triggered a storm of accusations. In this throwback to late August 2024, fans flooded social media with outrage and speculation, accusing Bündchen of ""stalking"" her ex-husband as images of her and current partner Joaquim Valente circulated widely.The controversy began when TMZ published photos showing Bündchen and Valente water-biking near Brady’s $17 million mansion on Indian Creek Island in Miami. Given that Gisele owns a nearby home just minutes away, many chalked it up to a coincidence. But for Brady’s die-hard supporters, it was too close for comfort.One fan @eolsen6955 furiously posted, ""What stalkers you are,"" while another @SalvadoreYog commented, ""Wow. She hit the wall fast. TB made the right move."" Another @U_Peacked added, ""Gisele is looking like the obsessed ex.""The online frenzy quickly turned toxic, with some fans even suggesting that Brady leaked the photos himself to portray Gisele as unstable.While there’s no evidence to support that theory, the timing and location of the photos certainly fueled suspicion.Despite the split being described as “amicable” in legal terms, both celebrities settled in close proximity. Gisele reportedly purchased and renovated her own mansion on Indian Creek Island, making random run-ins more likely—by land or by water.The two share co-parenting responsibilities for their children and had maintained a united public front after the divorce was finalized in October 2022. But these photos brought old tensions back to the surface, at least among fans.Whether it was an innocent outing or a calculated move remains a matter of opinion, but one thing is clear—Brady and Bündchen’s breakup saga continues to live rent-free in the public’s mind.Also Read: Tom Brady’s ex Gisele Bündchen gives fans emotional peek at baby boy during 45th birthday bash Photos showed Gisele and her boyfriend water-biking near Brady’s Miami mansion, which led fans to speculate she was spying on her ex.Yes, both own homes on Indian Creek Island in Miami, just minutes apart, which makes chance encounters likely.No, Tom Brady has not publicly commented on the viral photos or the fan backlash against Gisele.","Viral water-biking photos reignited Tom Brady-Gisele Bündchen drama.

Cris Carter believes Jalen Hurts has proven himself despite strong roster help



“I look at the last two Super Bowls he was in against Patrick Mahomes.

He outplayed Patrick Mahomes, and he should get credit for that.”

Jalen Hurts Deserves More Credit #philadelphiaeagles #jalenhurts #nfl #patrickmahomes #sports

The debate over stats versus winning



“If we’re measuring QBs, the first question is—did he win? What Jalen Hurts is doing is not his fault.

He’s the captain of the ship, and Philadelphia is a tough place to be a quarterback.”

Jalen Hurts’ dual-threat ability makes the Eagles more dangerous



FAQs:

1. What did Cam Newton say about Jalen Hurts?

2. Why is Hurts’ recent season criticized?

3. Has Hurts shown elite numbers before?

Jalen Hurts recently delivered the Philadelphia Eagles a Super Bowl championship and an MVP performance, yet his spot among the NFL’s elite quarterbacks is still being questioned. Former MVP Cam Newton recently left Hurts out of his top 10 QB rankings, but Hall of Famer Cris Carter isn’t buying it. In fact, Carter argues Hurts has done enough to earn credit even saying he outplayed Patrick Mahomes in their head-to-head Super Bowl matchups.During a recent segment, Carter defended Hurts after Newton’s comments sparked backlash across social media. Newton had suggested that Hurts doesn’t need to play at an “elite level” because of the stacked roster around him. Carter pushed back, saying Hurts shouldn’t be downgraded simply because his team is talented:Carter compared Hurts’ situation to Joe Montana’s era, pointing out that no one dismissed Montana’s greatness just because the 49ers surrounded him with elite weapons.Newton’s critique centered on Hurts’ passing totals, specifically last season’s 2,900 yards, which Newton claimed wasn’t enough to place him in the league’s top tier. Carter countered that a quarterback’s primary job is to win, not chase numbers:Hurts has shown he can post big numbers when needed, back in 2022, he threw for over 3,700 yards, rushed for 750+, and scored 35 total touchdowns. But his style emphasizes team success over stat-padding.Carter also highlighted Hurts’ impact beyond the box score. His mobility forces defenses to adjust, creating opportunities for teammates like Saquon Barkley to shine. When teams take away the run, Hurts has repeatedly stepped up as a passer in big moments especially in the postseason.Despite a Super Bowl victory, MVP honors, and back-to-back trips to the big game, Jalen Hurts is still fighting for respect in some circles. Critics see him as a product of his roster; supporters see him as a proven winner who thrives under pressure. As Carter put it, Hurts shouldn’t be penalized for leading a loaded team, he should be credited for keeping it at the top.Newton left Hurts out of his top 10 QB list, claiming Hurts benefits from an elite roster and doesn’t play at an individually elite level.He threw for around 2,900 yards, which some analysts feel isn’t enough to justify top-tier QB status, despite the Eagles’ success.Yes.

1. Is Sidney Crosby planning to leave the

Pittsburgh Penguins

?

2. How many Stanley Cups has Sidney Crosby won?

3. Has Sidney Crosby ever played for another NHL team?

As Sidney Crosby prepares for the 2025–26 NHL season, speculation surrounding his future in Pittsburgh has reached a fever pitch. After two decades of loyalty, leadership, and legacy with the Penguins, questions about whether the iconic No. 87 might seek a final Stanley Cup run elsewhere have intensified. Yet, despite growing whispers and even insider predictions, the answer to his future lies with one person—Sidney Crosby himself.In recent months, NHL insider Frank Seravalli floated the names of three potential destinations should Crosby ever decide to leave the Penguins. And with Pittsburgh missing the playoffs for a third consecutive year, the narrative of a final chase for glory outside Pennsylvania is gaining traction. Still, Crosby has shown no public desire to depart the city he’s called home since 2005.At 37, Crosby remains remarkably productive, coming off another standout season. He’s far from a veteran clinging to past glories. If he were to hit the trade market, he'd instantly become one of the most coveted players in the league. But for now, his loyalty to the Penguins appears unwavering.On a recent podcast, veteran NHL insider Pierre McGuire added a new layer to the discussion, suggesting that the only force capable of pulling Crosby out of Pittsburgh is Crosby himself.“He should be allowed to pick where he goes, and if he goes,” McGuire stated, emphasizing the respect and freedom Crosby has earned over the years.The Penguins have shown no intention of pushing their captain out the door. And rightly so. Crosby has not only delivered three Stanley Cups but also carried the franchise through its highs and lows with unmatched professionalism. The front office understands that if a decision is to be made, it must come from their most revered figure, not from them.For now, the conversation around Crosby's exit remains hypothetical. But if the day ever comes, hockey fans and executives alike know it won’t be management, media, or even legacy that moves him—it’ll be Sidney Crosby’s own call.As of now, Crosby has shown no indication that he wants to leave Pittsburgh.Sidney Crosby has won three Stanley Cups with the Pittsburgh Penguins (2009, 2016, 2017).No, Crosby has spent his entire NHL career with the Pittsburgh Penguins.Also Read: NHL Trade Drama: Connor McDavid’s future may be sealed soon as Oilers push for long-term deal to end all speculation","Sidney Crosby has spent his entire NHL career with the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Poll What is more critical for player safety in cricket? Concussion protocols. Injury replacements. Both are equally important.

How and why Rishabh Pant's England tour could come to an abrupt end due to toe fracture

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has strongly criticised the International Cricket Council (ICC)'s current concussion substitute policy, suggesting it lacks consistency and fairness.Speaking during the fourth Test between India and England in Manchester, Gavaskar argued that if concussion substitutes are allowed, there should also be provisions for injury replacements, especially in cases as clear as Rishabh Pant’s fractured foot.“I’ve always felt that you are giving a like-for-like substitute for incompetence,” Gavaskar told Sony Sports.“If you are not good enough to play short-pitched bowling, don’t play Test cricket; go and play tennis or golf. You are giving a substitute for somebody who gets hit because he can't handle it.”Pant, despite being seriously injured, returned to bat and scored a courageous fifty in India’s first innings of 358. However, his continued participation in the match — and possibly the series — is now unlikely.Gavaskar questioned why a substitute is permitted for a head blow but not for an obvious injury.“Here, it is a clear injury. There has to be a substitute. Let an independent committee, including medical experts, be formed to make these decisions,” he said.Former England captain Michael Vaughan, who was part of the discussion, agreed with Gavaskar and called for rule changes to protect the quality of the game.“If a footballer breaks a leg early in a match, they can be substituted. Why should cricket be any different?” Vaughan said. “Pant has a broken foot. He can’t play again in this match or the next. We need a clear protocol for like-for-like injury replacements in such situations.”With high-profile voices weighing in, the debate over injury substitutions in Test cricket is likely to intensify more.","Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has strongly criticised the International Cricket Council (ICC)'s current concussion substitute policy.

What NBA team does Stephen Curry play for?

What playing style does DeRozan promote for young athletes?

Stephen Curry’s groundbreaking influence on basketball has transformed the sport for an entire generation. His unique talent for hitting three-pointers has encouraged numerous young players to mimic his approach. Nevertheless, DeMar DeRozan, a long-time NBA star and six-time All-Star, has a word of caution for aspiring players: pursuing the 'Steph Curry model' might lead them in the wrong direction.In the 7 PM in Brooklyn podcast, DeRozan had a chat with young players and their parents, encouraging them not to feel the need to copy Curry. “I never want young guys that’s coming up to feel discouraged, like they’ve got to go out there and be Steph Curry,” DeRozan said. “Everybody’s just not going to be Steph Curry. It’s one Steph Curry.” His remarks underscore the fact that Curry's skill set stands out, even among NBA legends. DeRozan made this comment while addressing how young players tend to neglect various facets of the game in their quest for Curry-like shooting ability.DeRozan went further, emphasizing the uniqueness of Curry’s abilities: “What he’s able to do is incredible.I think we would never see nobody else like that.” This announcement points out how rare Curry's combination of shooting accuracy, basketball IQ, and stamina is. Being a four-time NBA champion and an 11-time All-Star, Curry's game encompasses more than just three-point shooting. His ongoing movement, ability to interpret defenses, and talent for making space distinguish him as a truly unique athlete.DeRozan being wary is seen in the challenges that the young players encounter whenever they attempt to copy the style of Curry. Most people only focus on his shooting of three pointers, yet most of the time they overlook those details that make him unique. The off-ball movement by Curry is one of the best in NBA history and this has assisted him in making open shots even in the tight defense. His fitness enables him to maintain a strong standard of play in the whole game and it is not something that everybody can achieve. Moreover, shooting mechanics that Curry has practiced throughout the years of his life are hard to replicate.Numerous young athletes who look up to Curry often find it hard to thrive in the NBA. DeRozan notes that players such as Trae Young, the star of the Atlanta Hawks and a great three-point shooter, have their own unique way of playing, even if they share a few traits with Curry.Also Read: Ja Morant’s viral dunk in China reignites debate over his NBA Dunk Contest absence despite fan pressure “It’s one Steph Curry,” he remarked, a straightforward but deep recognition of Curry’s unique talent.

Netflix Quietly Regrets Meghan Markle’s $100M Deal





Natasha Archer has been by the Princess of Wales’s side since 2010. She selected outfits for overseas tours, was even on hand at the hospital for royal baby photo calls, ready with spare outfits and supplies and was promoted to Senior Private Executive Assistant in 2022. Last week Kensington Palace confirmed Archer, now 37, is leaving to start a private “luxury consultancy.”Soon after the news broke, Archer switched her long-private Instagram profile to public. Royal watchers noticed two quick moves. She stopped following Meghan Markle , the Duchess’s lifestyle label As Ever, and several friends in Meghan’s circle, including makeup artist Daniel Martin and polo player Delfina Blaquier.The timing set off fresh speculation because the royal family is quietly trying to ease tensions with the Sussexes. Palace sources say aides for King Charles and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex held an informal meeting in London this month to explore next steps toward better relations. Prince William’s team did not attend, leaving doubts about how far any thaw can go.Commentators see Archer’s “unfollow” spree as a public hint that fences remain unmended. The Blast, citing insider chatter, called the move a “controversial stunt” that risks undercutting reconciliation plans said to be backed by Princess Kate herself.People who have worked with Archer stress her loyalty to the Wales household. She received the Royal Victorian Order in 2019 for personal service and is married to royal photographer Chris Jackson. Friends say her new consultancy will advise private clients on travel logistics and event styling, skills honed during fifteen years on royal duty.Neither Kensington Palace nor the Sussex office has commented on the social-media changes. Online, opinions split quickly. Some see the unfollows as a harmless reset before Archer’s career move. Others view them as a subtle show of support for Kate during a sensitive phase in family diplomacy.What happens next will likely unfold off camera. Kate is said to be focused on her children’s summer break and on a fuller return to public engagements later in the year. Meghan remains in California, preparing for new launches under her As Ever brand. Behind the scenes, advisers on both sides are expected to keep talking, while Archer steps into private life with new clients and fewer royal handles in her feed.For royal watchers, the small click of an unfollow button has added one more twist to a story that shows no sign of fading from the spotlight.","Natasha Archer has been by the Princess of Wales’s side since 2010.

Former Pakistan spinner Danish Kaneria has sparked debate by questioning India’s decision to participate in the upcoming Asia Cup 2025, just a day after the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) released the tournament schedule.Taking to social media, Kaneria wrote: ""Indian players boycotted WCL and called it national duty. But now Asia Cup vs Pakistan is just fine? If cricket with Pakistan is okay, then WCL should’ve been too. Stop using patriotism when it suits you. Let sport be sport — not propaganda.""Kaneria’s remarks reference India’s withdrawal from a match against Pakistan during the World Championship of Legends (WCL) in July. The Indian side—comprising retired cricketers—had opted out citing national sentiment.Now, with India and Pakistan scheduled to meet in the group stage of the Asia Cup on September 14, questions have been raised about the consistency of India’s stance on cricketing ties with Pakistan.The Asia Cup, scheduled from September 9 to 28 in the UAE, will be played in the T20I format as preparation for the 2026 Men’s T20 World Cup.For the first time, the tournament will feature eight teams. Group A includes India, Pakistan, UAE, and Oman, while Group B consists of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, and Hong Kong.India will also face UAE and Oman on September 10 and 19, respectively.Depending on results, India and Pakistan could clash again in the Super Fours and potentially in the final on September 28.“Hosting the ACC Men’s T20 Asia Cup 2025 in the UAE allows fans from across Asia to come together in a setting that mirrors our region’s incredible diversity,” said ACC President Mohsin Naqvi. “When crowds gather to witness the tournament’s unforgettable clashes, it will be a great reminder of cricket’s power to build bridges.”","Former Pakistan spinner Danish Kaneria has questioned India's decision to participate in the Asia Cup 2025.

Multiple Indian batters with 500-plus in the same away Test series

Sunil Gavaskar (774) & Dilip Sardesai (642) vs WI, 1970-71

Shubman Gill (697) & KL Rahul (508) vs ENG, 2025

NEW DELHI: India captain Shubman Gill and opener KL Rahul scripted history on Saturday as they became the first Indian batting duo in 55 years to each score 500-plus runs in an away Test series — a milestone last achieved by legends Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Sardesai in 1970-71.Their record-breaking partnership came at a crucial time for India during the fourth Test against England at Old Trafford, Manchester. Chasing survival after a brutal English assault powered by Ben Stokes' superb 141 and England's massive 669, India were rocked early — reduced to 0/2 in the very first over with both Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sai Sudharsan falling for ducks.But Gill (78*) and Rahul (87*) weathered the storm with a stunning rearguard action. The duo took India to 174/2 at stumps on Day 4, still trailing by 137 runs, but with momentum swinging back slightly towards the visitors.While anchoring India's hopes for a draw, both batters also etched their names into the record books. Gill’s tally in the series climbed to a staggering 697 runs, while Rahul breached the 500-run mark — becoming only the second Indian opener to do so in an away series after Gavaskar.This is only the second instance in Indian cricket history where two batters have scored over 500 runs each in a single away Test series. The previous occurrence was in 1970-71, when Gavaskar (774) and Sardesai (642) tore apart West Indies' bowling attack.Rahul also became just the second visiting Asian opener to score 500+ runs in a Test series in England after Gavaskar’s 542-run effort in 1979, and the first visiting opener since South Africa’s Graeme Smith (714 in 2003) to achieve the feat in the country in the 21st century.With one day remaining in the Test, Gill and Rahul’s historic partnership has given India hope — and a firm grip on the record books.","India captain Shubman Gill and opener KL Rahul scripted history on Saturday as they became the first Indian batting duo in 55 years to each score 500-plus runs in an away Test series.

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Mohammad Azharuddin has stirred the ongoing India-Pakistan cricket debate with a bold take on the upcoming Asia Cup clash between the two nations, questioning the inconsistency in cricketing ties between the neighbours.India and Pakistan are set to face off on September 14 as part of the Asia Cup 2025 under the Asian Cricket Council (ACC).Speaking on the contentious fixture, Azharuddin remarked, “I always say that everything should happen, or if it does not happen, then it should not happen at all. If you're not playing bilateral matches, then you shouldn't play international events too — that's what I believe.”His remarks come amid continuing political tensions that have stalled bilateral series between India and Pakistan for years, even as the teams continue to face off in ICC and ACC tournaments.Azhar also addressed the recent withdrawal of Indian veterans from their Legends League fixture against Pakistan in the privately organised World Championship of Legends (WCL).“This is a matter for the board and the government,” he said.“The veterans' league is not official, it's not sanctioned by the ICC or the BCCI . It’s conducted privately.

Poll Should Karun Nair have been given another chance in the fourth Test? Yes, he deserved a chance No, it was the right decision

Karun Nair’s long-awaited return to Test cricket after eight years was meant to be a fresh chapter—filled with big runs, vital partnerships, and a statement-making comeback. Instead, it turned into a struggle for form. Following a string of underwhelming performances in the first three matches, Nair was dropped from India’s playing XI for the fourth Test at Old Trafford.In six innings, the right-hander managed just 131 runs, prompting the team management to replace him with B Sai Sudharsan for the crucial fourth Test.India made three changes to their line-up in Manchester. Anshul Kamboj was handed a Test debut, while Sudharsan came in for Nair and Shardul Thakur replaced Nitish Kumar Reddy, who was sidelined due to a left knee injury.After Nair's exclusion, an emotional photo began circulating on social media, showing him being consoled by close friend and star cricketer KL Rahul The image quickly went viral, capturing what many assumed was the heartbreak of being dropped.However, a TimesofIndia.com fact-check revealed that the photograph was taken during the Lord's Test, not at Old Trafford.Nair’s comeback got off to a rocky start. In the first Test at Headingley, he was dismissed for a duck in the first innings and scored just 20 in the second.He retained his place for the second Test, posting scores of 31 and 26. A 40-run knock in the first innings of the third Test at Lord’s showed signs of promise, but he followed it up with a disappointing 14.With his spot under increasing scrutiny, captain Shubman Gill decided to leave him out for the fourth Test.Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif criticised the decision, suggesting that Gill missed an opportunity to show leadership by backing a player in need.“Today was Shubman Gill's chance to back Karun who was down but deserved one more chance. He should have picked Karun Nair. Chance missed to earn the respect when it comes to making tough decisions as a leader,” Kaif posted on X.England currently lead the five-match series 2-1, following their dramatic 22-run win in the third Test at Lord’s.","Karun Nair was dropped from India’s playing XI for the fourth Test at Old Trafford.

Poll How do you feel about India's injury management in the current series? It's been poorly handled They are doing their best Injuries are part of the game I have no opinion

India’s growing injury crisis in the ongoing Test series against England deepened further after star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant suffered a painful blow to his toe in the first innings, ruling him out of wicketkeeping duties for the remainder of the fourth Test in Manchester.It was later revealed that Pant had fractured his toe, a significant setback for the Indian camp already grappling with a long list of fitness concerns.The injury occurred during India's batting at Old Trafford.Pant, who had an injury scare earlier in this series, was struck hard on the toe by a Chris Woakes delivery while batting in the opening innings. The impact was severe enough to sideline him from behind the stumps, with Dhruv Jurel stepping in as a makeshift wicketkeeper.Pant, however, was cleared to bat in the second innings, a confirmation that came directly from India’s batting coach Sitanshu Kotak on Saturday.“Rishabh Pant will bat tomorrow,” Kotak said at the end of Day 4, signalling that while his mobility behind the stumps may be compromised, the team will still count on his batting to help salvage a draw.India’s injury list in this series has grown increasingly concerning, with frontline pacers Arshdeep Singh and Akash Deep ruled out entirely.Pant’s setback adds another dimension to the challenge India face going into a pivotal Day 5 at Old Trafford.Despite the grim context, India showed signs of fight through the unbeaten partnership between KL Rahul (87 not out) and Shubman Gill (78 not out), who guided the visitors to 174/2 at stumps on Day 4, still trailing England by 137 runs.With Pant likely to come in at No. 5 or 6, his ability to bat through pain could be vital if India are to save the match and keep the series alive.",Rishabh Pant ruled out of remainder of fourth Test with fractured toe.

Poll Do you believe Ben Stokes will be fit to bowl on Day 5? Yes, he will be fit. No, he will not be fit.

TimesofIndia.com in Manchester: England batting coach Marcus Trescothick is hopeful captain Ben Stokes will be fit to bowl on Day 5 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford. Speaking after stumps on Saturday, Trescothick said Stokes’ absence from the bowling attack on Day 4 was a result of the cramp he suffered on Friday and the workload he's managed across the match.“It is just a build-up from the workload and the cramps yesterday,” Trescothick explained. “We are hoping he will be back to bowling tomorrow. We will see what he is like in the morning.”Stokes had earlier made a massive impact with the bat, scoring a superb 141 to help England post 669. That came after his five-wicket haul in India’s first innings, underlining once again his unmatched value to this England team.But with India staging a remarkable fightback through KL Rahul and Shubman Gill , England will likely need their captain to contribute with the ball again if they are to take the remaining eight wickets and wrap up the series.The visitors were reeling at 1 for 2 at lunch but recovered well to end Day 4 on 174 for 2, still trailing by 137 runs. The calm resistance from Rahul and Gill has set up a fascinating final day.With a series-leading 16 wickets, Stokes may need to join the attack if the hosts are to dismiss India in time to claim victory. As the leading wicket-taker of the series, England will once again need their captain to step up on the final day, especially if they are to seal the series without going to The Oval.","England captain Ben Stokes will not bowl on Day 5 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford.

Poll Do you think India can save the Test match on Day 5? Yes, definitely! No, it's unlikely.

TimesofIndia.com in Manchester: India’s batting coach Sitanshu Kotak addressed the media after Day 4 at Old Trafford, where India put up a brave fight to take the match into the final day.Speaking about the pitch and the plan for Day 5, Kotak said, “Wear and tear will be there, but nothing else. Both today and tomorrow, we need to take it hour by hour and session by session.” With India trailing by 137 runs and rain expected, the team remains hopeful of saving the Test.Kotak was full of praise for the efforts of KL Rahul and Shubman Gill , who stitched an unbroken 173-run stand to frustrate England. “They’ve shown belief and determination. Absolutely brilliant the way they batted.

Brief scores: India 1st innings: 358 all out & 174/2 in 63 overs

vs England: 669 all out in 157.1 overs

Nearly two days of insipid bowling, another frantic period before the Lunch break and India's Test, and series, seemed as good as over early on Day 4 at Old Trafford. The visitors faced just three overs before the umpires flipped the bails to mark the Lunch break but those few minutes were enough for Chris Woakes to send Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sai Sudharsan back. Off consecutive deliveries!0/2, trailing by 311 runs, almost a batter short due to Rishabh Pant's fractured toe and five sessions to survive. It was a terrible position to be in. The overhead conditions and the variable bounce further complicated matters. By no means were the conditions and pitch unplayable but the mental and physical fatigue of chasing leather for 157.1 overs was going to make survival an enduring task.The equation wasn't about runs, follow-on and lead but seeing off the period. Yeah, that's the basics and that's what Test cricket is all about but the stakes made it a very delicate passage in play. For a side which fancies winning from any position, England would have been licking their lips after seeing the back of the two Indian left-handers who got solid starts in the first innings.In came Shubman Gill to join KL Rahul minutes before Lunch and the immediate task was to see off the hat-trick ball, which he did, and then to ensure there were no more casualties. Both boxes ticked but it would have been a nervy walk back to the change room for both right-handers as the onus was now on them to delay what looked like an inevitable England win at that point.They, however, were ready with the response as fluency and urgency took over from the pre-Lunch frenzy. Gill dealt in boundaries and had a very Leeds-like start to his innings while Rahul continued to be solid from the other end. The Indian skipper was tested with full and swinging deliveries on to the stumps but he was ready with the response and hit some gorgeous boundaries down the ground - on either side of the wicket.86/2 at Tea, Gill scoring his fifty and Rahul growing in confidence injected much needed stability into the proceedings for India as they didn't lose a wicket and frustrated the hosts during the second session. 'Fluency' was the key word as Gill scored runs for fun when he raced to 45 off just 52 deliveries. Deep into the second session, precisely after being dropped by Liam Dawson, he decided to drop anchor. Nothing flashy and everything solid!His partner at the other end continued to be the cotton wool soaking in all the pressure and not giving the opposition an inch. The individual fifties were hit, many milestones - Gill becoming first Asian batter to score 650+ in a Test series in England and India's second 100+ stand after going 0/2 - reached and frustration began to creep in for the hosts.The bowlers were swapped, a short-ball trap was laid out with fielders placed for hooks, pulls, upper cut and ramp but Rahul and Gill were far too settled to fall into any temptation. With Ben Stokes deciding against bowling, possibly due to the niggle on Day 3, England clearly missed the magical touch after Woakes' double-wicket over and the pitch not playing any tricks, except the odd one keeping low, didn't pose any real challenge for the duo who had their eyes well in.The little over three days of the fourth Test weren't a reflection of how India have fared in the series so far but as Gill has maintained, the bad moments - Day 3 in particular - have been so bad that it has had a big impact on the scoreline.The same could be said about the third day and morning of the fourth but the rear guard act led by the captain and senior batter Rahul has ensured even the fourth Test, like the previous three, is set up for a delicious Day 5 finish.(Gill batting 78, KL Rahul batting 87; Woakes 2/48)(Joe Root 150, Ben Stokes 141, Ben Duckett 94, Zak Crawley 84; Ravindra Jadeja 4/143).",Shubman Gill and KL Rahul remained unbeaten on 78 runs at close of play on Day 4 of the fourth Test between India and England at Old Trafford.
