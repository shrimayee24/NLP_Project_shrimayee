The Mumbai Indians (MI), one of the most successful franchises in Indian Premier League (IPL) history, are set to enter the 2025 IPL mega auction with a clear strategy and a strong financial position. Scheduled to be held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on November 24-25, the auction is expected to be highly competitive as teams look to revamp their squads for the upcoming season.MI, who endured a disappointing 2024 season finishing last in the 10-team league, will have Rs 45 crore remaining in their auction purse. With five IPL titles under their belt, MI will be looking to strengthen their squad by adding key players across different departments. They also hold one strategic Right to Match (RTM) card, allowing them to potentially retain a player by matching the highest bid during the auction.In preparation for the mega auction, MI confirmed the retention of five key players who form the backbone of their team. These retentions have used up a significant portion of their total auction budget of Rs 120 crore. Here's a breakdown of the retained players and the amounts spent:This retention cost MI a total of Rs 75 crore, leaving them with Rs 45 crore to spend at the auction. These players bring a wealth of experience and talent, with Bumrah as the bowling spearhead and Suryakumar Yadav, who is also India’s T20I captain, leading their dynamic batting lineup. Notably, Rohit Sharma, who recently retired from T20 Internationals after leading India to a T20 World Cup win, remains a pivotal figure for MI despite stepping down as captain. His leadership duties have been handed over to Hardik Pandya, who returned to MI after a stint as Gujarat Titans' captain.With Rs 45 crore in hand, MI will look to target crucial areas in their squad. They will be aiming to rebuild after a poor 2024 season, focusing on reinforcing both their batting depth and bowling attack. The presence of an RTM card gives them added flexibility to bring back a former player who might attract high bids.After five retentions, MI have a minimum of 13 slots and a maximum of 20 slots available to fill.Mumbai Indians will have several important slots to fill during the auction, with a focus likely on securing few world-class overseas talents and uncapped Indian cricketers. Additionally, MI could look to bolster their bowling unit to support Jasprit Bumrah, particularly with spinners and pacers who can adapt to different conditions.Having retained their core group of stars, including their new skipper Hardik Pandya and the explosive Suryakumar Yadav, MI now have the challenge of finding the right balance in the rest of their squad to return to their winning ways in 2025.Rs. 45 croreJasprit Bumrah (Rs. 18 crore), Suryakumar Yadav (Rs. 16.35 crore), Hardik Pandya (Rs. 16.35 crore), Rohit Sharma (Rs. 16.30 crore), Tilak Varma (Rs. 8 crore)13 players20 players8 playersAlso See: India vs South Africa Live","IPL mega auction to be held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on November 24-25.

Connor Williams retired from the NFL mid-season to recover from a severe knee injury

A new starting center for the Seattle Seahawks is sorely needed after Connor Williams retired from the NFL mid-season to recover from a severe knee injury he suffered playing in 2023 for the Miami Dolphins. Williams entered the league in 2018 as the No. 50 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft for the Dallas Cowboys, but initially started there at left guard before being benched after eight weeks. He eventually became a starting left guard after an injury to Zach Martin. Williams has played for the biggest teams in the NFL.Seattle Seahawks starting center Connor Williams has reportedly decided to retire immediately, the team's coach, Mike Macdonald, told reporters on Friday. He also stated that he feels Williams will not reverse the decision and return for the Seahawks to play out this season.Williams was drafted by Dallas Cowboys with the 50th overall pick in the second round of 2018 NFL Draft with the hope of allowing him to play guard. The Cowboys began tabbing him as the starting left guard before benching him during the first eight games in Week 10 and giving way to Xavier Su'a-Filo. He then played the next two games at right guard because of Zack Martin's injury.He signed a two-year deal valued at $14 million on March 17, 2022, to the Miami Dolphins. He quickly became the center and officially named a starter over Michael Deiter as the offseason program began. He played all 17 games, giving up 3 sacks and 6 penalties. He was the one player to play 100 percent of the offensive snaps with 1,057 snaps for the team.Williams was tabbed the number one center on the depth chart coming into the 2023 NFL season; the season had officially opened on August 8. On August 29 Dan Feeney was traded to the Chicago Bears and Alama Uluave was assigned to the practice squad, so Williams came into the season as the Dolphins' first-string center. In the Week 14 game against the Titans, he tore his ACL and was placed on injured reserve on December 13, 2023.Also Read: NFL commissioner Roger Goodell aims to expand the NFL season to 18 games within five years Head coach Pete McDonald said Olu Oluwatimi will take over starting center responsibilities.

Riding a crucial knock of 94 by Masaraf - and aided by a useful half-century by Sibsankar Roy (55) and a 43 from Sumit Ghadigaonkar, Assam set Chhattisgarh a target of 69 to win the match.But with the light already fading and very little time left in the day's final session to achieve the goal, Chhattisgarh could only muster eight runs in one over before the umpires called it a day and shared the honours.The draw meant that Assam languished at the bottom of Group D table with five points from as many games while Chhattisgarh - who earned three points from their first-innings lead - lay two rungs above them on sixth with 11 points after the fifth round.There was, however, no dearth of effort from the Chhattisgarh bowlers to claim the remaining nine Assam wickets on the day as quickly as possible. But they were undone by the resolute Assam batters who frantically held their ground in hopes of a draw and ended the second innings on 279.The only exception was the in-form Ravi Kiran , who managed another five-wicket haul in the match with his figures of 5 for 54 in 20 overs. Kiran ended with a 10-wicket match haul and took the title of Player of the Match despite the brilliant double century by his teammateAayush Pandey in the first innings.Pandey was short of time to play an encore of his earlier feat and stayed unbeaten on 7 off 5 balls - along with co-opener Anuj Tiwary (1 not out) - when stumps were called.For Assam, resuming on overnight 58/1, Musaraf was the architect-in-chief of the draw with his 172-ball 94 that included 13 boundaries and one that went over. His second-wicket partnership with Roy that lasted for 243 balls not only added 136 runs to the team total but it also snuffed out the hosts' hope for an outright win.Musaraf could not complete a well-deserved century as he was run out on a throw from Bhupen Lalwani.

NEW DELHI: On Friday evening, Delhi captain Ayush Badoni was reluctant to speak to the media even as he walked back unbeaten on 116 at stumps, with five wickets down for 238, in pursuit of Jharkhand's first innings total of 382. ""I'll finish the job tomorrow morning and try to score a double hundred. Only then I'll be satisfied,"" he had told TOI then.Halfway into the second session on Saturday, he chipped left-arm spinner Manishi for an effortless six down the ground to bring up his double hundred and overhaul Jharkhand's total with three wickets to spare. As he shook hands with the Jharkhand players, Badoni's unbeaten 205 off 216 meant he had single-handedly taken Delhi from a precarious 98/4 to secure three points in the weather affected match.Badoni, forever battling Delhi cricket 's selection politics, batted like a man possessed. He looked a cut above the rest, hitting 10 sixes and 16 boundaries. He got good support from No. 7 Sumit Mathur (43) and No. 9 Shivam Sharma (33 not out) to save Delhi the blushes.Badoni struggled to make the Delhi team when Lucknow Super Giants picked him in the 2022 IPL auction . Now, retained by LSG for Rs 4 crore and having been handed the Delhi captaincy before this game, Badoni oozed confidence. ""It does help that I don't have to worry about the IPL auction. I can concentrate on domestic cricket. I wanted to ensure I did something special as a captain so that the rest in my team also get confidence,"" Badoni said.Camp with Justin Langer helped evolution: A lot of his evolution can be attributed to his stint at LSG, where head coach Justin Langer even flew him down to Perth last year for 10 days.

The Indian skipper will rejoin the team for the second Test in Adelaide, set to be a day-night encounter under lights in Adelaide.Confirming the decision, an official close to developments stated, ""Rohit Sharma will not be featuring in the first Test.

Ganguly emphasized the importance of Rohit’s leadership in the high-stakes series, which he believes could be the 37-year-old’s final tour Down Under.""I hope Rohit Sharma goes very soon, because the team needs leadership. I believe his wife delivered a baby boy yesterday [Friday] night so I am sure he can leave.

India's T20I record in 2024: A year of domination marked by World Cup success,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/indias-t20i-record-in-2024-a-year-of-domination-marked-by-world-cup-success/articleshow/115374133.cms,"Tilak Varma and Sanju Samson (BCCI Photo)

NEW DELHI: The Indian cricket team concluded their final T20I assignment in record-breaking fashion. With Sanju Samson and Tilak Varma at the forefront, India scored a massive 283 - their second highest T20I total - at Johannesburg. The massive score put South Africa more or less out of the equation when they came to chase and India went on to win the clash and series by 3-1.The performance and the series win were fitting for India who had a stellar year in the T20 format. Across 2024, India played 26 matches, won 24 and lost two (against Zimbabwe and South Africa).India's win percentage in T20I was 92.31, the highest ever by any team in the format, surpassing Pakistan's 89.47% in 2018 (17 wins in 19 matches). In T20s, only Tamil Nadu's 93.75% in 2021 (15 wins in 16 matches) has been better in a year.The icing on the cake in 2024, or the cake itself, was the T20 World Cup title in the West Indies and USA. By going unbeaten throughout the tournament, India not only shed the bad memory of the ODI World Cup final defeat a couple of months earlier, they also ended their 11-year ICC title drought.Besides the title win that defined the team in 2024, they played five bilateral series - against Afghanistan, Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and South Africa - to win them all.With Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli stepping away from the shortest format after the T20 World Cup, the responsibility of leading the team went to Suryakumar Yadav and he has carried that with aplomb. India triumphed away in Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka and South Africa while also beating Bangladesh at home.Rohit and Virat, two of India's greatest cricketers, received a fitting farewell from T20Is. Rohit retired as a two-time T20 World Cup champion and India's all-time leading T20I run-scorer (4,231 runs in 159 matches, including five centuries and 32 fifties). At the T20 World Cup, he scored 257 runs in eight matches, including three half-centuries.Kohli, who had a modest tournament, delivered a decisive performance in the final against South Africa with a match-winning 75, earning the 'Player of the Match' accolade. He retired as the format's second-highest run-scorer, amassing 4,188 runs in 125 matches at an average of 48.69, with one century and 38 fifties.Except for the stalwarts, the youngsters embodied the aggression and ""win-at-all-costs"" attitude that was needed - especially after the 2021 World Cup.India struck a boundary every 4.68 balls this year, their best-ever ratio, and a six every 12.19 balls, another best.India scored 200-plus totals nine times, three times in the series against South Africa, thereby breaking the record for the most in a calendar year, previously held by Birmingham Bears (2022), India (2023), and Japan (2024) with seven each.Men in Blue batters scored centuries in almost every series in 2024, a stark contrast to their conservative approach of the years gone by. With seven centuries -- three by Sanju Samson, two by Tilak Varma, and one each by Rohit Sharma and Abhishek Sharma -- India set a record for the most team centuries in a calendar year in T20Is.India's overall runs-per-over (RPO) this year stood at 9.55, their highest ever and the second-highest by a men's T20I team in a calendar year (minimum 15 matches), only behind Australia's 9.72 in 2024.Individually, Sanju Samson flourished as an opener, scoring three centuries, the first-ever by any player. He was India's top run-getter in T20Is in 2024 with 436 runs in 12 innings, averaging 43.60 with a strike rate of over 180. As an opener, he tallied 461 runs in nine innings, averaging 57.62 and striking at 193.62.At the other end of the spectrum, he also recorded five ducks in the year - the most for an Indian player. Regis Chakabva of Zimbabwe had also recorded five scores of nought in 2022.During the fifth T20I in Johannesburg, Samson and Tilak Varma scored centuries in the same innings, marking the first instance of such a milestone for a Test-playing nation in a T20I.India's top five batters collectively struck at 135.08 in their first 10 balls this year, the highest-ever for the team and the third-highest for any side with a minimum of 15 matches.Eleven Indian batters scored 200-plus runs this year, with eight maintaining strike rates above 150. Among them were Tilak (306 runs at a strike rate of 187.73), Samson (436 runs, 180.16), and Yashasvi Jaiswal (293 runs, 172.35). Remarkably, five of these batters also averaged over 40.The year belonged not just to the batters but also the fielders. They bowled out the opponents 10 times in 26 matches, the joint-most for a Test-playing nation in a calendar year.Arshdeep Singh led the charge with the ball, taking 36 wickets in 18 matches at an average of 13.50, his haul the highest for a Test-playing nation bowler this year. The left-arm pacer finished the year out with two wickets needed to surpass Yuzvendra Chahal and become the leading wicket-taker for India in the format.Indian bowlers averaged 8.39 wickets per innings, the highest-ever among Test-playing nations in a calendar year.India recorded three victories by margins of 100-or-more this year, matching their tally from all previous years combined.In 2024, India also witnessed two of their top-five biggest wins in terms of balls remaining and one of only two 10-wicket victories in their T20I history.","India's win percentage in T20I was 92.31, the highest ever by any team in the format.

What do you make of the 0-3 drubbing at home against New Zealand?

How long does it take to adjust to Australian conditions, where there is pace and bounce, after playing on rank turners at home?

The Indian team seems to be slipping in the race for the WTC final...

Compared to now, was it different touring Australia in, say, 2003-04?

How important is it to set the tone early? Will the uncertainty over captain

’s presence hamper India in Perth?

This team seems to be in transition. Do you think the young generation is ready to step into a senior role?

For this generation of batters who have grown up on IPL, attack is their best form of defence. Do you think true bouncy tracks in Australia will be good for them?

There’s some uncertainty about who bats at No. 8 especially when you are not sure about playing two spinners…

Indian teams started competing in Australia consistently since the 2003-04 series where Sourav Ganguly ’s team came back with a 1-1 scoreline. As India get ready for another series Down Under following the debacle against New Zealand at home, Ganguly spoke to TOI about a host of topics. in India, setting the tone early in Australia and the next generation stepping up. Excerpts…It was surprising and unexpected. It’s a wake-up call for the team before going into such a big series in Australia. It must have given them a lot to think about and introspect what was lacking in the home series. But the team should always be looking to move forward and not carry the baggage of previous defeats.I don’t agree with the kind of pitches India played on in India. These square turning pitches serve no purpose at all. We have to believe that our spinners are good enough to take wickets on good pitches. Such pitches bring the opposition into the game. If batters get runs, it will eventually bring your quality spinners into the game at the backend of the match. Batters have not got runs and it’s tough to be in form on such pitches.You can’t go into a big series thinking so far ahead. Australia has always been a tough place to tour. It’s one of the hardest series to play. I suppose they have 10-12 days to train hard for the first Test. If the Indian team isn’t playing any practice matches, they must be focused on the areas they need to work on.In a way, it’s a good thing that the first Test is in Perth. It is a new stadium but the nature of pitches in Perth are such that the match will be result oriented. India need to think that the result will go in their favour. There will be no half measures in Perth and a draw is very unlikely.We used to play a couple of tour games before a series and that gave us an idea of how matches progress in Australia. One must remember we were a team which was doing well consistently overseas for a couple of years, be it the tour of England or the 2003 World Cup. We were a very confident bunch of players and had belief in ourselves. But things have changed now.These players travel to Australia more frequently. They always have a fresh idea about the conditions. And the majority of the players in this team have played quite a bit in Australia. That’s why even 10-12 days of hard practice along with a clear mind can be enough for these players. One must not forget this is almost the same set of players that won the previous two series in Australia.It’s very important to get off to a good start. It puts you in a great position in the series. I’m not sure about how Rohit is placed with his personal life. But had I been in his place, I would be eager to reach Perth and be a part of the Test if things were under control at home.Having said that, there are a plenty of senior batters like Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant who can take the responsibility and set the tone. Body language on the field has to be very positive but that shouldn’t be a distraction, especially in hostile conditions. Execution is the key.I don’t want to get into the talks of transition since I am not privy to what is happening in the system. If you talk about the next generation, then there is already Rishabh Pant who is a proven performer in overseas conditions for some years now. I believe a lot will revolve around him. I have a feeling Shubman Gill and Pant can go to the next level as senior batters at the end of the series.Talking about a settled batting lineup, I don’t see anything drastically unsettled. There’s Kohli, KL Rahul, Pant, Gill and Rohit who will hopefully join the team as soon as possible. They have toured and played a lot of cricket together. Yashashvi Jaiswal is a very good prospect too.One must acknowledge the game has changed a lot now. These batters have a range of shots and like to play in a certain way. But good players are those who can buckle down and be determined when there is help for the bowlers. That’s why I wasn’t happy with the rank turners in India which gave batters very little breathing space.There are enough good batters which can take the batting deep. R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja have shown their ability down the order. Then there’s Washinton Sundar as well. Whether you are willing to play two spinners, keeping the batting stability in mind is a call the team management has to take. Our bowling attack is good. And from what I gather, Mohammed Shami seems to be bowling well for Bengal. I won’t be surprised if we see him at some point of the five-Test series. That will boost the pace attack and then one can take that call regarding No. 8.",Sourav Ganguly speaks to TOI about India's upcoming series in Australia.

But India always look like they're pretty well-organised and well-planned. Fortunately, over the last few years, we've had some success in theWorld Test Championship (WTC) final and, in a different format, the ODI World Cup.

With veteran Mohammed Shami unavailable, Bumrah will be supported by Mohammed Siraj and a promising trio of young bowlers — Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna, and Akash Deep.For Australian skipper Cummins, Bumrah stands out as India's X-factor in the series.Bumrah boasts an impressive record in Australia, having played seven Tests and taken 32 wickets, including a five-wicket haul.""I am a big fan of Bumrah. He is a fantastic bowler and can play a big role for India in the series. He’s one of the guys who has played a lot of cricket in Australia,"" Cummins said.Cummins also acknowledged the absence of India's batting stars Cheteshwar Pujara and Rahane from the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.""They (Rahane and Pujara) both scored some really important innings. It was always great playing against Pujara. He was one of those guys who never really felt like he was getting away from you. But then he would bat, and bat, and bat, and bat,"" Cummins said.""I always really enjoyed the contest against him. Some days he won, other days I won. So, it's going to feel a bit different without him,"" he said.","India seeking third consecutive Border-Gavaskar Trophy series win on Australian soil. The much-anticipated clash begins with the opening Test on November 22 in Perth. India previously secured back-to-back series wins in Australia, first under Virat Kohli's leadership.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115374312,imgsize-40194,width-400,resizemode-4/115374312.jpg"

Dominant Jannik Sinner cruises into ATP Finals title decider with Taylor Fritz,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/dominant-jannik-sinner-cruises-into-atp-finals-title-decider-with-taylor-fritz/articleshow/115375429.cms,"Italy's Jannik Sinner (AP Photo)

Fritz's revenge chance

Jannik Sinner has his first ATP Finals crown firmly in his sights after crushing Casper Ruud 6-1, 6-2 on Saturday to set up a title decider with Taylor Fritz , the man he beat to win the US Open two months ago.Roared on by a partisan home crowd in Turin, Sinner extended his winning streak to 10 matches with another dominating display which showed why he is the first Italian to top the ATP's end-of-season world rankings.The 23-year-old has reacted to losing last year's final to Novak Djokovic by displacing the Serbian tennis icon at the top of the game, winning seven tournaments this season including his debut Grand Slam victory at the Australian Open before triumphing in New York in September.Sinner barely gave Ruud time to breathe as he rattled off the first three games and took the first set in half an hour, before sweeping to a comprehensive victory.""It's a great, great feeling. It's really special playing here,"" said Sinner.""It's a really important tournament, last year we lost the final, this year we've got a chance to try again and do better than we did last season.""But regardless of how it goes tomorrow it's been an emotional week with some great moments.""Ruud, who hadn't played Sinner for three years before Saturday, compared the shots he faced to ""rockets"" and was struck by how much he has improved.""You feel like unless you hit a ball with really good depth or close to the sidelines, and even if you hit close to the sidelines but not fast enough, he's going to rip it back at you,"" Ruud told reporters.""I got to practice with him here earlier leading up to the tournament. He also kicked my ass there. In a way I knew what I was facing today.""Fritz has a task on his hands to become the first American Finals winner since Pete Sampras 25 years ago as he has been comfortably beaten both times he has faced Sinner this year, with straight sets victories in the US Open final and the group stage in Turin.The world number five is the first US man to make the final since James Blake in 2006 after a thrilling 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7/3) triumph over Zverev.Fritz has a chance for revenge on Sinner for the US Open final defeat, following a gruelling match in northern Italy.Both players had chances to take control in a topsy-turvy third set, but failed to capitalise on a host of break points before Fritz held his nerve better in the tie-break to claim a spot in the final.Fritz managed to save three break points in game five of the third set, just when it looked like Zverev was set to take control of the match.""That was probably the biggest turning point, I lose one of those points and that's probably it. That's kind of how it goes with playing Sascha,"" said Fritz, who got to the semis two years ago.Zverev was aiming for a tour-leading 70th win of the season but his winning streak was snapped at eight matches after coming into Saturday's clash having not dropped a single set or service game in Turin.The 27-year-old admitted that he failed to take his chances when it counted after playing arguably the better tennis in the closing two sets of the match.""It was one of those days where everything, it takes times to get going,"" said Zverev.""It's like it's not a natural flow to movement patterns, to your shots as well, to just how you wake up in the morning. Everything is a little bit more tiring. I felt that way today.""On Friday night Zverev described the men's tennis calendar as ""crazy"", saying that he had not spent more than three consecutive days at home all year.","Italy's Jannik Sinner beats Casper Ruud 6-1, 6-2 to reach ATP Finals final. Sinner will play Taylor Fritz, who he beat to win the US Open two months ago. Fritz is the first US man to make the final since James Blake in 2006. Fritz beat Germany's Sascha Zverev in three sets to reach the final.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115375467,imgsize-59648,width-400,resizemode-4/115375467.jpg"

How long will Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja play?

NEW DELHI: Former Australian cricketers Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden have defended teammate Ricky Ponting following India head coach Gautam Gambhir 's befitting reply to Ponting's comments on Virat Kohli and skipper Rohit Sharma 's form ahead of high-profile Border-Gavaskar Trophy.The duo’s straightforward stance highlighted their belief in honest critique and the role of commentary in cricket, countering Gambhir’s assertion that Ponting should focus solely on Australian cricket.Gilchrist stated that Ponting, as a cricket legend and commentator, has every right to share his opinions on global cricket, emphasizing the importance of open discussions.“Punter can comment on anything he wants. I think he has earned the right to comment on most aspects of cricket. I love this, this is going to get the popcorn out for the rest of the summer,” said legendary wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist on the Club Prairie Fire podcast.Hayden, known for his bluntness, dismissed the notion that commentary should be limited to national boundaries.“We are paid to make an opinion, make a comment and make a call about the game we know and love,"" said Hayden on the podcast.In 2024, Kohli has struggled with his form, scoring just 488 runs in 25 innings across formats in 19 international matches, averaging 20.33. His performances in home Tests were particularly concerning, managing only one half-century in five matches against Bangladesh and New Zealand, with an average of 21.33 across those series.During the three-Test series against New Zealand, which India lost 0-3, Kohli scored 93 runs in six innings, slightly outpacing Rohit Sharma, who scored 91. Both senior batters faced criticism for their inability to deliver under pressure in critical games.India's upcoming five-Test series against Australia, beginning on November 22 at the Optus Stadium in Perth, is pivotal. With India currently ranked second in the World Test Championship (WTC) points table, strong performances in this series are crucial to maintaining their qualification hopes for the WTC final.","Former Australian cricketers Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden have defended teammate Ricky Ponting.

NEW DELHI: India dished out an all-round performance to inflict a massive 135-run defeat on South Africa in the fourth and final T20I in Johannesburg on Friday. With this victory, India clinched the four-match series 3-1.Chasing a mammoth 284-run target, South Africa were rattled by pacer Arshdeep Singh 's brilliance as he swung the ball both ways. He dismissed Reeza Hendricks in the first over and then quickly followed up with the wickets of Aiden Markram and Heinrich Klaasen His astonishing effort helped India reduce the hosts to a disastrous 10/4 within just 3 overs, effectively ending the contest early.South Africa's only focus now was to save face, with David Miller and Tristan Stubbs leading the fightback. The pair put on 86 runs before Varun Chakravarthy struck, dismissing Miller.Stubbs fell off the very next ball to Ravi Bishnoi, and India wrapped up the innings, bowling South Africa out in the 19th over. Marco Jansen showed his all-round abilities with a few big hits, but it was too little, too late.Earlier, Sanju Samson 's precision andTilak Varma 's muscular elegance combined as India effortlessly dismantled the South African bowling attack to post a commanding 283/1.This total not only marked India's highest-ever T20I score overseas but also became the highest by any team on South African soil.Among the numerous records shattered, the standout achievement was the rare feat of two Indian batters scoring centuries in the same T20I innings. Samson and Varma also set the record for India’s highest-ever partnership in T20Is—210 runs off just 93 balls for the second wicket.Samson (109* off 56 balls), who had already struck a brilliant century in the first game, once again put the Proteas to the sword alongside Varma (120* off 47 balls), who has been in sensational form at number three, brimming with confidence and vigour.Samson now has three T20I centuries in his last five innings, including two ducks, while Varma has scored back-to-back centuries.Samson reached his century in 51 balls, while Varma took just 41 balls to bring up his ton—10 balls fewer than his partner.Abhishek Sharma (36 off 18 balls) also deserves credit for setting the tone in the Powerplay with four huge sixes.On a flat track offering true bounce, the Indian batsmen were in full flow, hammering a record 23 sixes. Samson’s nine maximums were just one shy of Varma’s 10.","India inflict 135-run defeat on South Africa in fourth and final T20I in Johannesburg.
