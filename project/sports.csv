Clear verdict: Few races too close to call in Delhi polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-elections-clear-verdict-few-races-too-close-to-call/articleshow/118077016.cms,"NEW DELHI: The 2025 assembly election was a closely fought one with BJP and AAP putting up a great fight in almost all assembly constituencies, but the final results were decisive. Despite a small difference of just 2.6% in the vote share, BJP won 48 of 70 seats while AAP was reduced to only 22.There were just two seats in the capital - Sangam Vihar and Trilokpuri - which were decided by a margin of less than 500 votes, and only one - Jangpura - where the gap between the votes of the winner and the closest rival was between 501 and 1,000 votes.As per the data, 24 seats were decided by a margin of 10,000 votes or less. In 22 constituencies, the difference of votes was more than 20,000 which was less than half of seats decided by a similar margin in the 2015 assembly polls when AAP got a record mandate with 67 seats, indicating how comprehensive the party's victory was 10 years ago. In the subsequent election in 2020, 29 seats saw the winning candidates getting a lead of 20,000 votes or above, once again proving AAP's dominance in the election.AAP's Aaley Mohammad scored the biggest victory, winning the Matia Mahal seat by a record 42,724 votes. While Aaley, who was deputy mayor in MCD in 2023-24, got 58,120 votes, his nearest rival and BJP's Deepti Indora could bag only 15,396 votes. Aaley got over 68% of the total votes polled, and Indora could barely manage a little over 18%. The seat has become a family fiefdom, as Aaley's father Shoaib Iqbal won this seat for six terms. His only defeat came in 2015 when he lost to AAP's Asim Ahmed Khan.AAP's Zubair Ahmed won Seelampur with the second largest margin of 42,477 votes by defeating BJP's Anil Gaur. Interestingly, Zubair's father Mateen Ahmed won this constituency five times in a row, from 1993 to 2013, on Janata Dal and Congress tickets, but lost the 2015 and 2020 polls. He moved to AAP last year along with his son and daughter-in-law, who is a municipal councillor.From BJP, Vijender Gupta emerged as the biggest winner by defeating AAP's Pradeep Mittal by a margin of 37,816 votes from Rohini. This is Gupta's hat-trick of victories. Gupta was the leader of opposition from 2015 to 2020, and again from June 2024 till now.In Sangam Vihar, BJP's Chandan Kumar Chaudhary defeated AAP's Dinesh Mohaniya by a narrow margin of 344 votes, scoring the narrowest victory of the season. In Trilokpuri, a reserved constituency, Ravikant Ujjain of BJP defeated AAP's Anjana Parcha by second lowest margin of 392 votes.Having won the last election by a small margin of 3,200 votes from Patparganj in 2020, AAP's second-in-command, Manish Sisodia, shifted to Jangpura constituency hoping to score a comfortable victory this time. But he faced a narrow defeat of just 692 votes, at the hands of BJP's Tarvinder Singh Marwah.Of 699 candidates who contested this election, only 144 managed to save their security deposit. This included all 70 from AAP, all 70 of BJP and its allies (Janata Dal (United) in Burari and LJP (Ram Vilas)), three from Congress and Shifa ur Rehman Khan of AIMIM in Okhla.","BJP won 48 of 70 seats while AAP was reduced to only 22.

Theare eyeing a potential buyout acquisition to reinforce their backcourt and support their star-studded duo of Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler . With the Warriors recently adding Butler to the roster in a multi-team deal, they may look to bolster their guard depth after losing Dennis Schröder , who was valuable as a distributor and ball handler.The latest player to make waves on the buyout market is, a 34-year-old point guard who could be the perfect addition for Golden State. After winning an NBA championship with the Denver Nuggets in 2023, Jackson had a brief stint with the Philadelphia 76ers before being traded to the Washington Wizards. Shortly after the February 6 trade deadline, the Wizards waived Jackson, leaving the Golden State Warriors with a legitimate opportunity to sign him.As Clutch Points’ Brett Siegel highlighted,Reggie Jackson has previously played for several teams, including the Oklahoma City Thunder, Detroit Pistons , Los Angeles Clippers, and Nuggets, earning a reputation for his scoring ability and quickness to the rim as a primary ball handler.While Reggie Jackson may not return to his days with the Pistons, where he averaged 16.0 points per game, he brings valuable experience and leadership as a 14-year NBA veteran. His scoring prowess and ability to handle the ball could make him a reliable backup for the Golden State Warriors , especially as they aim to complement Curry and Butler’s $208 million worth of star power.Despite not being known for his efficiency, Jackson’s vast experience makes him an attractive option for Golden State, especially as they look to fill the void left by Schröder. The Golden State Warriors have long thrived on their depth, and Reggie Jackson’s ability to contribute meaningful minutes off the bench could be just what they need.Jackson might soon be seen wearing a Golden State uniform, which would bring even more quality to the team's already strong roster, while the NBA community observes.Also read: NBA Trade Rumor: Los Angeles Lakers’ master plan could land $175.3 million Milwaukee Bucks star and pair him with Luka Doncic in 2027 Let us know in the comments down below if you feel Reggie Jackson can replace ex-Warriors star Dennis Schröder.","The Golden State Warriors are looking to sign Reggie Jackson to bolster their backcourt.

Just as the NFL world shifts its focus to the upcoming Super Bowl, Congdon has found herself at the center of controversy.Old tweets from over a decade ago have resurfaced, and they’re sparking major backlash online.The posts, which reportedly contain racial slurs—including the N-word in Disney movie titles—have ignited a wave of criticism, with many questioning her past actions and calling for accountability.

When and where to watch the game between the Dallas Mavericks and the Houston Rockets (February 8, 2025)?

All eyes are on the most recent injury report as the(27-25) prepare to meet the Houston Rockets (32-19) at the American Airlines Centre on February 8, especially regarding the health of star big. There are questions regarding the eight-time All-Star's availability for Saturday's game because he has been labeled as probable due to an abdominal problem.Anthony Davis is expected to debut in tonight's game.The Dallas Mavericks are dealing with multiple injuries heading into the matchup:• P.J. Washington (Personal) – Day-to-Day• Dwight Powell (Hip) – Out• Caleb Martin (Hip) – Out• Anthony Davis (Abdomen) – Probable• Dereck Lively (Ankle) – OutSince joining Dallas, Anthony Davis has been a dominant force, averaging 25.7 points and 11.9 rebounds per game, making him the team’s leading scorer and rebounder. His presence in the paint has been instrumental in the Mavericks’ success, ranking sixth in the league in rebounding and providing much-needed interior defense.Davis’ injury designation suggests he is likely to play, but given his history of health setbacks, the Mavericks may proceed cautiously. If he is limited or unavailable, Daniel Gafford and Dwight Powell (who is already ruled out with a hip injury) would have seen increased roles, but Powell’s absence leaves Dallas thin in the frontcourt.The Rockets are also facing injury woes, with key players unavailable:• Fred VanVleet (Ankle) – Out• Cody Zeller (Personal) – Out• Steven Adams (Ankle) – Day-to-Day• Jabari Smith Jr. (Hand) – OutWith Houston missing VanVleet, Jabari Smith Jr., and potentially Adams, Davis’ presence could be a game-changer for Dallas, should he suit up.Dallas sits in the middle of the Western Conference standings and needs every win possible to climb higher.

Why did Juan Soto choose the New York Mets over the Yankees?

Biggest Questions surrounding 2025 Yankees | Pinstripe Post 41

“If I were a Yankee fan, what I would be thinking is, Juan Soto rejected us for the Mets. The Yankees have not had a bad season for over 30 years, right? To go to a team that has finished first six times in their history and has never made the playoffs three years in a row, there was something either lacking in the Yankees in his view or something so enticing in the Mets’ whole setup that it feels like it wasn't just about money at the end.”

“If I were a Yankee fan, that’s what I’d be looking at and saying, for the first time in king of the history of the two teams being together, but certainly over the last 30 years, or maybe even the last 50 years, the Steinbrenner era since the early 1970s, a player of stature said, 'I’d rather play there than here. And that is really interesting to me, and it questions the dynamic of where we are in New York baseball in 2025 and moving forward.”

""The Mets are a great organization and what they have done in the past couple of years, showing the ability to keep winning, to keep growing a team, to try to grow a dynasty, is one of the most important things. The future that this team has has a lot to do with my decision.""

Chicago Cubs Is One Of The “Worst Places” For Alex Bregman To Play In For The Upcoming MLB Season, As Per Jesse Rogers



Fans Dont Agree Chicago Cubs Is One Of The “Worst Places” For Alex Bregman To Play In



Alex Bregman, one of the most popular and talented players of Major League Baseball , is one of the last remaining free agents , with Spring Training beginning in just a couple of days. Many fans believe that Alex Bregman will rejoin his former team, the Houston Astros, after initially rejecting their $156 million offer for six years. But nothing has been confirmed yet; Alex Bregman has also received interest from other teams as well, including the Chicago Cubs.But apparently, the star played should not even consider joining the Chicago Cubs , as per ESPN ’s Jesse Rogers.On a recent episode of ESPN’s Baseball Tonight, Jesse Rogers spoke about one of the major reasons that Alex Bregman should consider for not joining the Chicago Cubs is the “environment”.ESPN’s Jesse Rogers adds, “I went to Baseball Savant, went to the Park Factors leaderboards, sorted by right-handed hitters, and just examined how much of a liability he would be playing in, in Wrigley Field.”He continues to say, “It is the most difficult ballpark of any for a right-handed hitter to double. Which is basically the most important skill that Alex Bregman needs to be chasing.”Jesse Rogers also added that had he been in Alex Bregman’s position, he would have chosen the Boston Red Sox and the Toronto Blue Jays over the Chicago Cubs. According to Jesse Rogers, MLB players and their agents should consider the environment they would be playing in for the season and how it “matches” their bat speed, skill set and swing.Apparently, Chicago Cubs would be one of the “worst places” for Alex Bregman to join, as per ESPN’s Jesse Rogers. He also goes on to add that Alex Bregman’s fly ball potency “is not nearly what it used to be” and so the Wigley Field will be one of the “worst places” for Alex to play baseball in.These strong statements of Jesse Rogers has divided fans. A fan took to X and wrote, “This is the type of overanalyzing cybermetric bs that is ruinimg baseball. To say a mlb professional hitter should avoid a destination at all cost because they may not hit as many doubles. Plenty of players for and against hit many doubles on that field. 🤦‍♂️”Another fan wrote, “You know what deep fly outs and doubles turn into when the wall is closer? Home runs.”With Alex Bregman remaining a free agent, emotions are on the rise. Fans are truly confused about the decisions Alex Bregman and his sports agent, Scott Boras, have been considering. With Pete Alonso finalising a deal with the New York Mets, all eyes are on Alex Bregman now.Also Read: Brandon Nimmo’s recent comments on Pete Alonso’s return to the Mets spark mixed reactions from fans","Chicago Cubs Is One Of The “Worst Places” For Alex Bregman To Play In For The Upcoming MLB Season, As Per ESPN’s Jesse Rogers.

When Danica Patrick Took Over Super Bowl Sunday – The Racy Ad That Set the Internet Ablaze



godaddy danica patrick shower

Danica Patrick, former NASCAR driver, has a history of stealing the spotlight on Super Bowl Sunday. One of her most memorable moments came in 2009 when she nearly broke the internet with a GoDaddy commercial that pushed the boundaries of bold advertising. As the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles gear up for this weekend’s championship showdown, one of Patrick’s past Super Bowl ads has resurfaced, igniting fresh conversations on social media.During Super Bowl XLIII, GoDaddy featured Patrick in an ad where she was seen showering multiple times while three men controlled her movements using a computer keyboard.The commercial took an even more daring turn when another woman joined Patrick in the shower. Even today, it remains one of the most audacious commercials the NFL world has ever witnessed.Few Super Bowl commercials have left as lasting an impression as the iconic GoDaddy ads featuring Danica Patrick. Over a span of 14 Super Bowl appearances—more than any other celebrity—Patrick became the face of provocative, attention-grabbing marketing. GoDaddy, known for its edgy advertising, found the perfect partner in Patrick, blending her athleticism and beauty with their signature brand of humor and controversy.During the 2000s, GoDaddy's Super Bowl strategy relied on racy innuendos and adolescent humor to drive viewers to its website. “Nothing turned on America every single February quite like a Danica Patrick GoDaddy ad in the second quarter of the Super Bowl. Nothing.” While these commercials garnered attention, they also sparked criticism for being sexist and offensive. Some were even deemed too provocative for national television, adding to the brand’s notoriety.One of the most controversial moments came in 2015 when GoDaddy aired a commercial featuring Patrick that was later pulled due to backlash from animal rights activists. The ad depicted a puppy finding its way home, only to be sold online via a GoDaddy-powered website. Pet lovers and advocacy groups found it distasteful, leading to its cancellation before the game. Addressing the controversy, Patrick defended the ad, stating, “We thought it was a really funny, slightly left-side, joke. People have an opinion about everything, especially when you get into that world of animal rights or tree rights, or whatever rights.”Also Read: Why Justin Bieber said no to Usher’s Super Bowl 2024 halftime show invitation Despite the criticism, Danica Patrick’s partnership with GoDaddy cemented her legacy in Super Bowl advertising history. While the nature of Super Bowl commercials has evolved, her impact on the era of bold, controversial marketing remains undeniable.","Former NASCAR driver Danica Patrick has a history of stealing the spotlight on Super Bowl Sunday.

Additionally, veteran center Andre Drummond is listed as day-to-day with a toe injury, leaving the Sixers' frontcourt thin.Without Embiid, the Sixers have struggled to find consistency on both ends of the floor. The team ranks 25th in the league in scoring, averaging 109.1 points per game, and has a negative scoring differential of -178.

Over the last 20 games, Maxey has averaged an impressive 28.9 points, 6.9 assists, and 3.3 made three-pointers per game.

Steve Kerr Calls for NBA to Move Trade Deadline After Golden State Warriors Struggle Against Utah Jazz

Draymond Green says Jimmy Butler and Miami Heat were bound to part ways after years of fatigue

Golden State Warriors Struggle at 25-26 as They Look to Jimmy Butler for a Playoff Push

The Golden State Warriors are rolling the dice with Jimmy Butler , but what’s the price tag? They shipped off some key players just before facing the Jazz, and you could see the emotional strain in their tight loss. Coach Steve Kerr is not pleased and is pushing for the NBA to change the trade deadline rules. With Golden State sitting at 25-26, all eyes are on Butler.Can he be the solution to their playoff issues?Right before their game with the Utah Jazz the team was heavily affected by how recent the trade had occurred. Early during the Utah Jazz vs Golden State Warriors game Andrew Wiggins gave his emotional goodbye to his teammates before choosing to play with Miami Heat .Coach Steve Kerr attributed the Warriors' 131-128 loss to the Jazz to the fact that the trade occurred too late before the match.

Bill Maher shared his thoughts on the romance between Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce

Even celebrity comedian and political commentator Bill Maher is weighing in on the relationship between Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce -who appears to have been made of the controversy that his girlfriend, the star of Taylor Nation, wanted to avoid.Now, the Chiefs are scheduled to play the Philadelphia Eagles in the third Super Bowl of the month, and Swift, who started dating Kelce at the beginning of the season, may be in attendance.Swift's appearance at the Chiefs' games has become a weekly event.Recently, Bill Maher, one of the most popular hosts of podcasts, shared his thoughts on romance during an episode with special guest Luke Bryan. Known for being frank about anything to do with relationships, Maher even went as far as defending Taylor Swift during a recent episode of his Club Random podcast.Swift and Kelce, the football star and America's sweetheart, have been swooning fans after their six-year private relationship with actor Joe Alwyn, sending the pop star fans into an excitement spree. While some predict that the two might be getting ready to tie the knot at the end of Super Bowl LIX if the Chiefs end up winning it, Maher doesn't see this love tale going as fairy-tale-like for these two. Maher said mixed words about Swift's music by saying that he doesn't fully understand their style, but at the same time, he remains a huge admirer of theirs.“To be that far up in the stratosphere and not be doing anything stupid, be still a good role model, basically,” said Maher. “You know, she’s had a bunch of boyfriends, but who hasn’t? The only thing people can say about her [is] she’s had boyfriends?” Bryan said. “Then she goes and lands Travis Kelce and then it’s like, ‘Oh my gosh, she’s crushing it.”’Swift has faced significant criticism for her dating history and songs, with fans like Bryan supporting her. Despite popular belief that Swift has found ""the one"" with Kelce, Maher disagrees. “First of all, that’s gonna end,” said Maher. “I want to go on record saying - and this is not a knock on either one of them, I think they’re both fine people - but that relationship is going to end like Rihanna‘s husband, ASAP and Rock,” he said “Look, Travis is not the keeper. He’s just not. I mean, he’s not yet ready to be house-trained. He’s not. And he’s going to be coming off another Super Bowl.”Bryan, hesitant to discuss the matter, questioned Maher's involvement. Maher responded that Kelce is Bryan, ""20 years ago, with more liquor in him."" This is not the first time Maher has made such a suggestion, as he previously predicted Kelce would dump her in a previous podcast episode. “I’m sure she’s a lovely person, but the whole thing with the football player,” Maher said at the time.“I just felt like 35 was a little old to be like, ‘My boyfriend’s a football player, and I wear his jersey to the game with his number on it!’ Right? I mean, come on. With her, it’s like the Gatorade at the Super Bowl,” he went on. “You know you’re gonna get dumped. You just don’t know when.”Also Read: Taylor Swift sparks pregnancy rumours as Travis Kelce's friend revealed that Swift gasped as Kelce said the word “baby” However, Maher does seem to be among the few believing that the couple's relationship is never going to step beyond this.","Bill Maher shared his thoughts on the relationship between Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce on his Club Random podcast.

Super Bowl Overtime Rule: How the NFL Decides a Winner in Case of a Tie



Super Bowl Overtime: How It Works

The New Overtime Rule And How To Play It

1. Duration of Overtime Periods

Each overtime period lasts 15 minutes, unlike the regular season, where overtime is capped at 10 minutes. This extended period ensures there’s enough time to determine a clear winner.

If the score remains tied after the first 15-minute period—or if the team that received the second possession hasn’t completed its initial drive—another overtime period begins. This process continues until a winner is declared.

2. Guaranteed Possession for Both Teams

One of the most significant differences from the regular season is that both teams are guaranteed a chance to possess the ball at least once in overtime. This rule was introduced prior to the 2022 season to address concerns about fairness.

In the regular season, if the team that receives the opening kickoff scores a touchdown, the game ends immediately. However, in the playoffs, even if the first team scores a touchdown, the opposing team still gets a chance to respond. This ensures a more balanced competition.

4. Timeouts and Challenges

5. Multiple Overtime Periods

6. Coin Toss and Captain’s Choice

Key Takeaways for Fans

Overtime periods are 15 minutes long, and multiple periods are played if necessary.

Both teams are guaranteed a possession, unless the receiving team commits a safety on the first drive.

The next score wins after both teams have had their chance, but extra points are skipped if the game ends on a touchdown.

There are no coach’s challenges, and each team gets three timeouts per half.

The Super Bowl has been around since 1967, yet only two editions have needed overtime to crown a champion. The first came in 2017 when the Patriots miraculously erased a 28-3 deficit against the Falcons, with Tom Brady leading New England to victory. The second occurred in 2024 when the Chiefs and 49ers battled into extra time, with Kansas City prevailing. Could history repeat itself? If another Super Bowl heads to OT, here’s what you need to know about the rules.The NFL’s overtime rules have always been a hot topic, especially in the playoffs, where games cannot end in a tie.While the format remains largely the same in the regular season and postseason, there are crucial distinctions in playoff overtime—especially after the rule changes introduced in 2022. These adjustments were implemented in response to intense matchups like the unforgettable Chiefs vs. Bills 2022 AFC Divisional Round, where Kansas City secured the win with a touchdown on their first overtime possession, leaving Buffalo without a chance to respond.In the NFL postseason, including the Super Bowl, overtime is designed to guarantee both teams a fair shot at victory while maintaining the intensity of the game. Here’s a breakdown of the key rules:""Both teams must have the opportunity to possess the ball at least once during the extra period, unless the team kicking off to start the overtime period scores a safety on the receiving team’s initial possession, in which case the team that kicked off is the winner."" – NFL RulebookThe only exception is if the team that begins with the ball commits a safety. In this rare scenario, the game ends, and the kicking team is declared the winner, just as in the regular season.If the first team to possess the ball doesn’t score, or if the score is tied after both teams have had a possession, the game continues, and the next score—by any method (touchdown, field goal, or safety)—wins.Importantly, if a team scores a touchdown to win the game, extra points are not attempted, as the game ends immediately upon the score.Each team is allotted three timeouts per half (with two overtime periods counting as a half). This allows for strategic clock management during the extended play.There are no coach’s challenges in overtime. All replays are initiated by the replay official, ensuring that critical calls are reviewed without disrupting the flow of the game.If the score is still tied after the first overtime period—or if the second team’s initial possession hasn’t concluded—another 15-minute period begins. There’s a two-minute intermission between overtime periods, but no halftime break after the second period.If the game remains unresolved after four overtime periods, a new coin toss takes place, and play continues until a winner emerges. The NFL is committed to playing as many overtime periods as necessary to determine a victor.""If there is still no winner at the end of a fourth overtime period, there will be another coin toss, and play will continue until a winner is declared."" – NFL RulebookOvertime begins with a coin toss, and the winning team can choose to kick, receive, defer, or select which goal to defend.If the game goes into a second overtime period, the captain who lost the first coin toss gets to make the choice—unless the team that won the toss deferred their decision initially.For NFL fans, understanding the postseason overtime rules is crucial, especially during the high-pressure moments of the playoffs. Here are the most important points to remember:These rules ensure that the NFL postseason remains one of the most exciting and fair competitions in sports, with every team given a fair shot at victory.Also Read: Jason Kelce shrugs off extra halftime rest advantage as brother Travis Kelce gears up for fifth Super Bowl appearance The NFL’s postseason overtime rules are a fascinating blend of strategy, fairness, and excitement. By guaranteeing both teams a chance to possess the ball and extending the length of overtime periods, the league has created a system that rewards skill and resilience. Whether you’re watching the Super Bowl or a nail-biting divisional playoff game, these rules ensure that the outcome is decided on the field, not by the flip of a coin. So, the next time you’re watching an overtime thriller, you’ll know exactly what’s at stake and how the game will unfold.","Overtime periods are 15 minutes long, and multiple periods are played if necessary.

Patrick Mahomes vs. Jalen Hurts: Who Has the Edge in Super Bowl LIX?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/patrick-mahomes-vs-jalen-hurts-who-has-the-edge-in-super-bowl-lix/articleshow/118079213.cms,"Image via LAPRESSE

Patrick Mahomes vs Jalen Hurts: stats and recent games

The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles will meet for the Lombardi Trophy two years after their Super Bowl LVII match. Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts will look to enhance or redefine their legacies as starting quarterbacks in Super Bowl LIX.Mahomes is on a Hall of Fame trajectory with a win Sunday bringing him three consecutive Super Bowl victories and four rings in seven years as Chiefs' starter.Hurts, at 26, is the first Eagles quarterback to reach two Super Bowls in his career, looking to make up for an upcoming Super Bowl bout.Any person ranking anyone above Patrick Mahomes on a Super Bowl list seems almost disrespectful, but fantasy stats would say that one player has the higher fantasy upside. Jen Hurts is an elite rusher for touchdowns, with 52 rushing scores in the last four years. His consistency really solidifies him as a top fantasy player: he hit the 10-rushing-touchdown benchmark in all four seasons.Hurts' fantasy performance against Washington in the NFC Championship Game is spectacular, recording 246 yards, a TD to A.J. Brown and three rushing TDs. His similar stat in Super Bowl for the same team against Washington has him recording 304 yards and one score by air, and 70 and three rushing touchdowns on the ground. Even with the loss Hurts gave solid fantasy performance which will out due Mahomes if such performance translates.The Kansas City Chiefs defense is improved from the Super Bowl, so Hurts has fantasy upside based on his effectiveness in producing rushing touchdowns on goal-line plays. He does have to compete with Saquon Barkley for red area rushing scores though. Hence, Hurts has a slight fantasy edge in DFS rankings for the QB position.Patrick Mahomes has won three straight Super Bowls and will have the opportunity to win his third Lombardi Trophy in a row, which no NFL quarterback has ever done in the Super Bowl era. That makes it tough to oppose him coming into the biggest stage in the game. The ranking, however, is not an indictment of Mahomes' ability to win on the biggest stage.Mahomes was sharp in the fantasy in the AFC Championship Game against the Buffalo Bills, throwing 288 yards and three touchdowns, but he played against a flailing defensive unit that struggled quite a bit at the back half of the season.Also Read: Why are Super Bowl 59 ads shifting to AI commercials while movie trailers take a backseat Mahomes fans may argue that he deserves a spot in accuracy due to his heavy workload for a less talented passing lineup. However, most categories, except for Super Bowl experience, were close to a coinflip. Eagles fans should be happy with Hurts' efficiency, but Mahomes' numbers may not be the prettiest this year. The Sunday head-to-head is expected to be ultra-competitive, taking the game to a must-see finish.","The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles will meet for the Lombardi Trophy two years after their Super Bowl LVII match.

Maaya Rajeshwaran’s dream run ends in Mumbai Open semifinals defeat to sublime Jil Teichmann,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/maaya-rajeshwarans-dream-run-ends-in-mumbai-open-semifinals-defeat-to-sublime-jil-teichmann/articleshow/118081631.cms,"Maaya Rajeshwaran (@rnadalacademy on X)

MUMBAI: Getting to the semifinals of the L&T Mumbai Open was already a massive success for Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi , particularly considering the 15-year-old hadn’t originally planned to play the WTA125K event.On Saturday, Jil Teichmann , an opponent currently ranked 117 in the world, and as high as 21 less than three years ago, proved a hurdle too steep for the promising teenager from Coimbatore.The fifth seed from Switzerland needed only 68 minutes to seal her spot in Sunday’s final, winning 6-3,6-1 to end Maaya’s remarkable run at the Cricket Club of India here.Teichmann will battle the eighth seed Mananchaya Sawangkaew for the title, after the 22-year-old Thai stunned second seed Rebecca Marino 6-2, 6-2 in the first semifinal.As much as it’s been a special eight days for Maaya, who was given a wild card to the qualifiers by the tournament officials, it’s also been physically demanding. On Friday, she needed to go to a deciding set for the third time in the week to beat Japan’s Mei Yamaguchi in the quarterfinals. And she would admit to feeling the cumulative toll on her legs, as Teichmann seized control of the match from the start.The 27-year-old Swiss, with two WTA titles to her name, successfully managed to neutralise Maaya from the baseline with her powerful groundstrokes to break the y oung Indian twice for a 4-0 lead. Then, a loose game on serve which came out of nowhere sparked Maaya’s best spell of the match. The home girl was suddenly swinging freely and delighted the near full-house with three roaring winners to hold serve for the first time. She knocked on the door again in the next game, earning two break points, which the experienced Teichmann did well to stave off and extend her lead.Having negotiated the teenager’s best spell, Teichmann was barely troubled from there on.The challenge of taking on a quality lefthander, something Maaya had been wary about following her-quarterfinal win on Friday, had proven to be a daunting experience after all.“It (playing a lefty) was worse than I expected,” Maaya would chuckle later. “Also, I did play a very experienced player and I felt that I didn’t play the way I hoped I would. Also I was physically a bit tired.”There were still “a lot of positives” gained from a week which saw Maaya come into the tournament unranked and finish with 55 ranking points. When the latest WTA rankings come out on Monday, Maaya will be in 645th spot.","Jil Teichmann beats Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi 6-3,6-1 in the semifinals of the L&T Mumbai Open.

NEW DELHI: Unseeded Canadian player Denis Shapovalov continued his impressive run at the ATP Dallas Open on Saturday. He defeated the defending champion, Tommy Paul , in straight sets, 7-5, 6-3, to secure a spot in the final.Shapovalov's journey has been remarkable, as he previously eliminated world number four Taylor Fritz in the second round.In the other semifinal match, second-seeded Casper Ruud of Norway faced a tough challenge from Spain's Jaume Munar.After splitting the first two sets, the match went into a decisive third-set tiebreaker. Ruud prevailed 7-6 (7/4) after a hard-fought battle that lasted over two and a half hours.Shapovalov's victory over Paul, who is currently ranked ninth in the world, was achieved in just an hour and a half. This marks the second top-10 opponent that Shapovalov has defeated in the tournament. His next challenge will be to face Ruud, the world number five, in the final on Sunday.Ruud acknowledged the difficulty of his match against Munar, stating, ""Second and third set (Munar) really stepped it up."" He also recognized the mental aspect of the game, admitting that he might have benefited from Munar's nerves as the Spaniard served for the match in the third set. ""I know what the feeling is like,"" Ruud said.""You can get tight. You kind of see the finish line a few yards in front of you and then you kind of stumble. I've done it myself and I was fortunate to be on the right side of it today.""In the tiebreaker, Ruud took control by hitting a backhand down-the-line winner to grab a 4-2 lead. He extended his advantage to 5-3 when Munar missed a backhand volley, and then went up 6-3 with an overhead smash.Ultimately, Munar netted a forehand to hand Ruud the victory, leaving their head-to-head record at 4-1 in favour of the Norwegian.For Ruud, this final represents an opportunity to claim his 13th career ATP title and his third consecutive finals win, following triumphs last year inBarcelona and Geneva. He holds a 2-0 head-to-head record against Shapovalov, who will be competing in his eighth ATP final and seeking his third title after victories in Stockholm in 2018 and Belgrade last November.The stage is set for an intriguing final showdown between the unseeded Shapovalov, who has been on a giant-killing run, and the second-seeded Ruud, who has consistently performed at a high level throughout the tournament.","Denis Shapovalov defeated defending champion Tommy Paul in straight sets, 7-5, 6-3.

Brief scores: Mumbai 278/8 in 81 overs (Mulani 91, Kotian 85 batting, Rahane 31, Kamboj 3/58) vs Haryana

KOLKATA: It's a story Mumbai seem to be telling everyone too frequently this season. The top order is in disorder, the new ball is doing all the tricks and the lower order is rising to the challenge and rescuing the team.There was no exception at the Eden Gardens on Saturday. The defending champions were staring down the barrel at 101 for six at lunch on Day I of their Ranji Trophy quarterfinal clash against Haryana here on Saturday.But Shams Mulani and Tanush Kotian pulled them out of the woods, stitching together a 165-run eighth-wicket stand that saw them end the day at 278 for eight.Haryana got the perfect start when pacer Anshul Kamboj clean bowled opener Ayush Mhatre in the first ball of the match after Mumbai skipper Ajinkya Rahane won the toss and decided to bat first. The Eden wicket always provides some early movement for the bowlers and Haryana pacers Kamboj and Sumit Kumar took full advantage of that to strike hard. Akash Anand, a centurion in the last match, was next to go, shouldering arms to a Sumit delivery that cut back in sharply to crash into his off stump.The experienced Siddhesh Lad was dismissed off the very next delivery as Kamboj got his second wicket when the batter inside edged one to his stumps.Much was expected of Suryakumar Yadav , who made a fluent start, hitting two glorious fours through the offside. But he lasted just five balls as the India T20I skipper was clean bowled through his bat and pad off Sumit.Shivam Dube also made a positive start with a boundary. The allrounder did not hesitate to play his shots, even hitting Anuj Thakral for the only six of the day. But the left-hander perished soon after, getting a thick edge off Ajit Chahal to be caught at gully by Yashvardhan Dalal for 28.Kamboj struck again after coming in for his second spell, getting Mumbai's dependable skipper Rahane caught behind for 31. The downslide continued after the lunch break as Shardul Thakur departed for 15 offering a simple return catch to Thakral. It was a tough start for Mulani and Kotian as the former survived an LBW appeal and a DRS call. Kotian was also beaten a few times outside the off-stump, but the two quickly settled down, helping Mumbai to get 101 runs in the second session at the cost of just one wicket to save the day.","Defending champions were 101 for six at lunch on Day I of their Ranji Trophy quarterfinal clash against Haryana here on Saturday.

Jason Kelce Keeps It Simple During Halftime



Peyton and Eli Manning, Super Bowl 59 Preview and Sucking on Crawfish Heads in New Orleans | Ep 123

The Super Bowl is unlike any other game in the NFL, and no one knows that better than the Kelce brothers. Travis Kelce , the Kansas City Chiefs ’ star tight end, is gearing up for his fifth Super Bowl appearance, while his older brother, Jason Kelce , has led the Philadelphia Eagles in two of the biggest games of his career. From the intense media coverage to the trip to a neutral venue, everything about the Super Bowl sets it apart.But one of the biggest adjustments for players is the halftime show—an event that extends the usual break to nearly double its length.While one might assume that players use the extra time to fine-tune their game plan or focus on an extended warm-up, Jason Kelce has a much simpler approach. When asked about his Super Bowl halftime routine, he offered an unfiltered and hilarious response.“Motherf-----, it’s 10 more minutes,” Kelce said. “I’m pretty sure I’m not getting cold now. I’m going to eat an Uncrustable and get my mind right for the second half. I don’t need you to tell me to stretch my quads.”Kelce’s words highlight how many NFL players stick to their routines, even when the stakes are at their highest. Unlike the regular season, where halftime lasts about 12 to 15 minutes, the Super Bowl’s halftime show , filled with elaborate performances, extends the break to over 30 minutes. This unusual schedule can throw off players’ rhythms, making it feel less like a traditional break and more like restarting the game.Recognizing the Super Bowl’s extended halftime as a potential disruption, legendary coach Bill Belichick once took an unconventional step to prepare his team. Back in 2012, ahead of the New England Patriots’ Super Bowl matchup, Belichick halted practice mid-session and sent his players to the locker room for 30 minutes—mimicking the actual halftime experience.“It really gets into a whole restarting mentality,” Belichick said at the time. “It’s not like taking a break and coming out in the second half. It’s like starting the game all over again.”Also Read: “A loss in the Super Bowl matters more than any loss”: Tom Brady has a stark warning for Patrick Mahomes ahead of Super Bowl LIX This year, players will once again face the challenge of staying sharp through a prolonged halftime, with Kendrick Lamar headlining the show in New Orleans.

NEW DELHI: Spanish world number three Carlos Alcaraz secured his place in the final of the Rotterdam Open on Saturday after a hard-fought and entertaining three-set victory over Hubert Hurkacz .The match showcased Alcaraz's resilience and determination as he overcame stubborn resistance from the Polish player, winning 6-4, 6-7 (5/7), 6-3.The match began with Alcaraz facing an early setback, as he was broken in his opening service game, allowing Hurkacz to take a 3-0 lead in the first set.However, Alcaraz displayed his fighting spirit, saving a break point with a brilliant crosscourt forehand and holding onto his serve.Despite facing three more break points, Alcaraz fought back, breaking Hurkacz's serve and seizing the game with a forehand smash after a lengthy rally.The momentum shifted in Alcaraz's favour, and he capitalized on a double-fault from Hurkacz to serve out the set, sealing it with a forehand drive volley winner.The second set proceeded more conventionally, with both players holding serve until the tie-break. The tie-break was a closely contested affair, with both players squandering chances to gain the advantage.Ultimately, a double-fault from Alcaraz at 5-4 up gave Hurkacz the opportunity he needed, and the Pole seized it, taking the set as Alcaraz netted a simple backhand groundstroke.The decisive third set started similarly to the first, with an early break of serve – this time in Alcaraz's favour. The Spaniard brought the crowd to their feet with his aggressive play, and his lead proved enough to break Hurkacz's resistance. Serving for the set at 5-3, Alcaraz booked his place in his 22nd ATP tour final with a trademark forehand winner up the line.""I want to be the first Spanish player to be able to win this tournament. I'm going to go for it. I'm really happy to be able to play a final in Rotterdam,"" said the 21-year-old Alcaraz, expressing his determination to claim the title.In the other semi-final, Alex de Minaur of Australia brought an end to the extraordinary giant-killing run of Italian qualifier Mattia Bellucci with a straight-sets win, 6-1, 6-2.De Minaur's consistency proved too much for the error-prone Bellucci, who was unable to replicate his earlier heroics against Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas.""I'm very happy with the level today,"" said De Minaur. ""He's been playing with a lot of confidence this whole week, so I knew it was going to be a very tough battle."" The third-seeded Australian has enjoyed a comfortable passage to the final, winning all his matches in straight sets.With both players displaying impressive form, the stage is set for an enthralling final showdown between Alcaraz and De Minaur. Alcaraz, the top seed, will be aiming to become the first Spanish player to win the Rotterdam Open, while De Minaur, the runner-up last year, will be seeking his first title in the tournament.","Carlos Alcaraz beats Hubert Hurkacz 6-4, 6-7 (5/7), 6-3 to reach Rotterdam Open final.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: While giving Virat Kohli 's fitness status a go-ahead, India's batting coach Sitanshu Kotak also brushed aside concerns about Rohit Sharma 's lengthy lean patch. The captain has been short of runs for a while now.""I personally don't think there is any problem. I mean, in the last three Onedayers before this series (in the Nagpur ODI Rohit scored just 2 runs) Rohit has scored 56, 64 and 35.So, he is averaging nearly 50-plus in those last three ODIs. We are talking about a player who has got 31 ODI hundreds. And when they keep scoring runs, nobody asks when they will fail,"" Kotak told reporters here.""When somebody gets out (early) or has a little bit of a lean patch, I don't think I would be worried or thinking about their form. Yes, if you are talking about the Australia Tests, that was a tough time. But about the One-dayers, there's not really much concern about that,"" said Kotak. Rohit has scored 166 runs in his last 16 innings across formats at an average of 10.37, with only one 50-plus score to his name.After a slow start to their chase in the first game in Nagpur, Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill gave India a solid platform before Axar Patel joined Gill to take India closer to the finish line. However, there was a mini-collapse as the hosts lost six wickets soon after, before reaching home with four wickets in hand.Kotak, however, said he didn't read much into that. ""We lost two early wickets (too). But there a lot of positives, the way No. 3, 4 and 5 batted. There were two big partnerships. Gill, Shreyas and Axar batted really well. Somewhere down the line, you are going to lose some wickets. As a batting unit or as a team, there were a lot of positives.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Star India batter Virat Kohli has recovered from his knee injury and will be available for selection in the second ODI against England at Cuttack on Sunday.Batting coach Sitanshu Kotak confirmed Kohli's fitness status during a pre-match media interaction.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" Kotak told mediapersons on the eve of the second game.Kotak remained uncertain about who Kohli would replace in the playing XI.India's chase of 249 in the first ODI began on a shaky note, with Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rohit Sharma departing early, leaving the team at 19/2. However, Shreyas Iyer steadied the innings with a counterattacking 36-ball 59, ensuring India remained on track.After the match, Iyer revealed that his inclusion in the XI was a last-minute decision following Kohli's injury. Now, with Kohli fit to return, the team faces a selection dilemma over who will make way.Kotak acknowledged that he had no role in the final team selection.""That's something for the head coach and captain to decide. Yes, the left-right combination is an important factor, but that's not a question for me to answer,"" he said.Rohit's struggles in the Test format extended to the first ODI, where he was dismissed for just two runs off seven balls.Across his last 16 innings in all formats, Rohit has managed only 166 runs at a disappointing average of 10.37, with just one half-century to his name.""I personally don't see any issue with his form. In his last three ODIs, Rohit has scored 56, 64, and 35,"" Kotak said.""That means he has been averaging over 50 in those matches. We are talking about a player who has 31 ODI centuries. When someone keeps scoring, no one questions when they will fail,"" Kotak, who was appointed in the aftermath of their Australian Test series defeat, added.""Sometimes, a player might have a lean patch, but that doesn't worry me. Yes, in the Australia Test match, it was tough, and he got out early, but in ODIs, he has been performing consistently. So, there's no real concern about his form.""Kotak acknowledged the team's shaky start but emphasised the middle order's crucial contributions in stabilizing the innings.""We lost two early wickets, but there were plenty of positives, especially how our No. 3, 4, and 5 batted. Two big partnerships stood out. Gill, Shreyas, and Axar all played really well,"" he said.""In any match, you might lose wickets, whether it's the openers or the middle order. But overall, as a batting unit, we showed great intent. Even when the required rate was nearly 9-10 runs per over, we didn't let them gain control.""With the Champions Trophy set to commence on February 19 in Dubai and Pakistan, Kotak expressed confidence in their preparation.""The entire team looks solid. Whether there is any experiment, new players will come to the XI or some senior players will be left out. It's the head coach and captain who will discuss and they will decide. So, I don't think I can make any comment on that.""On Mohammed Shami's fitness, Kotak reassured that the pacer was ""completely fit"". Shami returned to the International cricket in the preceding T20I series after a 14-month injury layoff.Asked whether Arshdeep Singh might get a chance, he repeated, ""That decision lies with the head coach and captain.""Regarding Jasprit Bumrah's injury status, he admitted he was unaware of the scan results.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

MUMBAI: Soon after his blazing 36-ball 59 helped India coast to a four-wicket win over England in the opening ODI in Nagpur, Shreyas Iyer threw in the shocking revelation that he wasn't even in the team's starting XI for the match.In fact, he was busy watching a movie the night before the game, until the extent of Virat Kohli 's knee injury became clear and forced the Mumbai cricketer's last-minute inclusion.Walking in when India, chasing 249, had slipped to 19/2 in the sixth over, the Mumbaikar produced a stunning counter-attack, smashing two sixes and nine fours to leave England floored. ""So (it is a) funny story. I was watching a movie last night. I thought that I could extend my night, but then I got a call from the skipper saying that you may play because Virat has got a swollen knee. And then (I) hurried back to my room, went off to sleep straight away. I'm going to keep it lowkey and just cherish this moment, the victory,"" Iyer told Star Sports. ""I wasn't supposed to play the first game. Virat unfortunately got injured and then I got the opportunity. But I kept myself prepared, I knew that at any point of time I can get a chance to play.""The fact that he wasn't in the XI for the first ODI is surprising. Does Iyer enjoy the full confidence of the team management? It emerges that he was even in danger of not being picked for this series and even the Champions Trophy that follows before better sense prevailed. ""There was quite a fair bit of debate on his inclusion in the lengthy selection meeting in Mumbai recently. Ultimately, those backing him cited his ODI average (47.69), and he was selected,"" a source told TOI.It helped that the selectors didn't forget his fabulous show in the 2023 ODI World Cup, where he scored 530 runs in 11 matches at 66.25, with two centuries (including a 70-ball hundred in the semifinal against New Zealand at the Wankhede Stadium) and three fifties. His sublime form in domestic cricket — the 30-year-old scored 325 runs in five matches at 325 — with two centuries even as Mumbai were knocked out in the Vijay Hazare Trophy , buttressed Iyer's case. Many, including former Australian captain Ricky Ponting , currently the head coach of Punjab Kings, have been left stumped by the fact that Iyer, who was signed up for Rs 26.75 cr in the IPL auction last year, doesn't automatically find a spot in India's white-ball XI.Former India batsman Pravin Amre , who has coached Iyer from a young age at his Shivaji Park Gymkhana academy and then in the Mumbai team and Delhi Capitals, is pleased with the fact that Iyer is a part of the India squad again, considering that he doesn't even have an India contract as of now.""Before he left to join the Indian team for this series, I told him, ‘Wearing the India jersey again should be a proud moment for you. Hold it with both your hands. God is kind that you've got this opportunity (to play for India) again.'""To be in the India squad is a big thing, and I'm very happy that he's there. And now, after the kind of innings that he's played, he's given a good headache to the decision-makers before the next game (should Kohli recover from his injury), and at the same time, shut his critics,"" Amre told TOI.For someone well-versed with minute details about Iyer's batting, what impressed Amre about the batter's innings was the ease with which he tackled the short ball, something often pointed out in the past to pan him. In the seventh over, Iyer smashed Jofra Archer's short balls for back-to-back sixes, pulling the pacer over deep midwicket and ramping him over the third man.""What was pleasing was that even though he was playing for India after more than six months, it never looked like he was playing for his place. He was playing for the team and did what the team needed him to do. When he walked out to bat, India were in trouble and England's pacers were bowling at 140-plus. I liked the way he timed the ball. He wasn't just slogging wildly. He was playing proper cricket shots. I'm just disappointed he got out to a spinner,"" said Amre.",Shreyas Iyer's blistering 59 helped India coast to a four-wicket win over England in the opening ODI in Nagpur.
