NEW DELHI: As the Rajasthan Royals travel from the desert sands of Rajasthan to the flood-prone region of Assam, they seek to regain their peak form, which seems to have eluded them in recent times. Until recently, their match against Punjab Kings on Wednesday was considered a prelude to the anticipated top-of-the-table clash with Kolkata Knight Riders at the same venue on Sunday.However, three consecutive losses in May have dented the Royals' fortunes and their ""invincibles"" tag. Currently positioned to finish as table toppers after the league stage, they now need to win at least one of their remaining two games to secure a top-two finish alongside KKR, who have already sealed their spot. KKR have 19 points from 13 games, while RR follow with 16 points from 12 matches.Under the leadership of the charismatic Sanju Samson , Royals couldn't ask for a better opponent than the significantly weakened, bottom-placed Kings to secure the desired top-two position before facing the formidable KKR. However, RR will be without explosive opener Jos Buttler , who has returned home to lead England against Pakistan in a four-match T20 series as part of preparations for the upcoming T20 World Cup in June. Uncapped English opener Tom Kohler-Cadmore is expected to partner with Yashasvi Jaiswal at the top of the order.Already at the bottom of the standings with eight points from 12 matches, the Punjab camp has been further impacted by the unavailability of several key players ahead of their penultimate game. Shikhar Dhawan, who has missed most of the season due to a shoulder injury, has reportedly been ruled out of the last two games.Jonny Bairstow and stand-in skipper Sam Curran are set to leave for England after Wednesday's game, leaving Punjab with the task of finding another captain for their final match against Sunrisers Hyderabad. Liam Livingstone and Chris Woakes have already departed India.In the history of the IPL , Punjab Kings and Rajasthan Royals have squared off 27 times. Among these encounters, Punjab has emerged victorious in 11 matches, while Rajasthan has claimed victory in 16 instances. These statistics underscore Rajasthan's dominance over Punjab in their head-to-head clashes, indicating a challenging rivalry between the two teams.The Barsapara Cricket Stadium, in its brief IPL history, has hosted two matches, with both resulting in victories for the teams batting first. The ground has proven to be favourable for setting targets, with an average first innings total of 198 runs. This indicates the importance of a strong start, with teams capitalizing on the pitch conditions and scoring freely in the initial overs to lay a solid foundation for a competitive total.In the two matches played at Barsapara, the average powerplay score stands at 56.5 runs, highlighting the significance of the opening six overs in setting the tone for the innings. Additionally, the average death-over score of 51.5 runs suggests that teams have managed to maintain their momentum towards the end of the innings, contributing to the overall high-scoring nature of matches at this venue.The wicket at Guwahati's Barsapara Stadium has garnered a reputation for being batting-friendly, offering ample opportunities for batsmen to score freely. This assertion is substantiated by the performances in the last two International matches held at the venue, where both the team batting first and the chasing side managed to surpass the 200-run mark. Such high-scoring encounters underscore the batting paradise that the Barsapara Stadium often transforms into during matches.1) Given the high-scoring nature of the pitch and the likelihood of both teams posting formidable totals, batsmen are valuable fantasy picks. Look for top-order batsmen who have a history of scoring big runs and can capitalize on the batting-friendly conditions to accumulate a significant number of runs. Players who are adept at playing both pace and spin and have a good strike rate should be prioritized in fantasy teams.2) All-rounders who can contribute with both bat and ball can be valuable fantasy picks on this pitch. Since the surface is conducive to batting, all-rounders who can provide stability in the middle order while also chipping in with crucial overs can fetch points from both batting and bowling performances. Look for all-rounders who have a good track record in similar conditions and can make an impact with their all-round skills.Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson(w/c), Riyan Parag, Shimron Hetmyer, Dhruv Jurel, Yuzvendra Chahal, Nandre Burger, Ravichandran Ashwin , Trent Boult, Avesh Khan, Sandeep SharmaRovman PowellJonny Bairstow (wk), Prabhsimran Singh, Rilee Rossouw, Jitesh Sharma, Shashank Singh, Sam Curran (c), Ashutosh Sharma, Harshal Patel, Rahul Chahar, Arshdeep Singh, Vidhwath KaverappaAtharva TaideIPL 2024 Stats: 344 runs in 12 matchesIn IPL 2024, Yashasvi Jaiswal showcased his batting prowess by accumulating an impressive tally of 344 runs in 12 matches, establishing himself as a dependable run-scorer for his team. His consistency and ability to anchor innings were vital in providing stability to the batting lineup and contributing to his team's success throughout the tournament.

He amassed 207 runs and showcased his prowess with the ball, claiming 14 crucial wickets in the 12 matches he played. His ability to deliver impactful performances in different facets of the game proved instrumental in shaping his team's fortunes.IPL 2024 Stats: 15 wickets in 12 matchesYuzvendra Chahal displayed his bowling prowess in IPL 2024, scalping an impressive tally of 15 wickets in 12 matches. Known for his crafty leg-spin bowling and ability to outsmart batsmen, Chahal played a pivotal role in providing crucial breakthroughs for his team and exerting control in the middle overs. His knack for picking up wickets at crucial junctures made him a valuable asset for his team's bowling attack.

After Delhi Capitals defeated Lucknow Super Giants on Tuesday to keep their slender playoffs qualification hopes alive, Rajasthan Royals became the second team to book a spot in the top four of the ongoing Indian Premier League Only six league matches left in the tournament, and five teams are still in the fray for the two remaining playoff spots.Here's the chances of the teams in contention of the final two spots in the IPL playoffs: KKR now have a 75% chance of finishing sole toppers and a 25% chance of ending up in sole second spot, assuming no more matches get rained off.If they win their last game, they will top. They could top even if they lose their last game, provided RR don’t win both their remaining games* RR will top the table if they win their remaining games. Their chances of being sole toppers are a respectable 25%. They also have about 40% chance of finishing sole second. They are now guaranteed qualification because even if they lose both their remaining games, they will either finish sole third or tied for third with* Third placed CSK are sure to finish among the top four teams on points, but are not assured of qualification. They could end up tied third with up to four other teams (DC, RCB, SRH and LSG) or tied fourth with up to three other teams (DC, RCB and LSG) depending on results in other games. What helps is their better net run rate at this stage* Fourth placed SRH too are sure to finish among the top four on points, but they too are not sure of qualification. They could find themselves in a tie with four other teams (DC, RCB, CSK and LSG) for third place if they lose both their remaining games. They could also end up in a three-way tie for fourth spot with DC and LSG. But even just one win from their two remaining games would guarantee qualification* Fifth placed DC’s chances of finishing among the top four on points, singly or jointly, have doubled to 62.5% thanks to Tuesday’s win. But they are far from sure of qualifying. A third place finish on points would involve a four-way or five-way tie, while finishing fourth would mean a two-way to four-way tie depending on results in other games* Sixth placed RCB have a 50% chance of making it to the top four spots on points, singly or jointly. Their last game against CSK is a must-win, but even winning it is not enough. Other results will need to go their way* Seventh placed LSG, despite Tuesday’s loss, are not out of it yet. They still have a 31% chance of finishing among the top four spots on points, singly or jointly. The bad news, however, is that finishing third would involve a five-way tie while ending up joint fourth would mean a three-way or four-way tie and their NRR is the worst among all the teams they could tie with* MI, PBKS and GT have already been knocked out.",Five teams are still in the fray for the two remaining playoff spots.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru have orchestrated a remarkable resurgence in the Indian Premier League (IPL) playoff race, bouncing back from their early-season struggles under the captaincy of Faf du Plessis . Following a rocky start, marked by seven losses in their first eight matches, Bengaluru embarked on an impressive five-match winning streak.Sunday's commanding 47-run victory over Delhi Capitals propelled them to fifth place in the table with 12 points, edging past Delhi and Lucknow on net run rate .In a must-win encounter, Bengaluru overcame the early setbacks of Du Plessis and leading run-scorer Virat Kohli , as Will Jacks' brisk 41 off 29 balls and Rajat Patidar's aggressive 52 off 32 deliveries powered them to a challenging total of 187-9.Their bowlers then delivered a clinical performance, dismantling Delhi's batting line up to dismiss them for 140 in 19.1 overs. Pacer Yash Dayal starred with the ball, claiming three crucial wickets to seal Bengaluru's emphatic victory and reignite their playoff aspirations in the IPL.After LSG lost to DC on Tuesday, RCB now need to secure a victory against CSK in their last league game by either:- Winning by 18 runs.- Chasing the target within 18.1 overs.This is necessary to surpass CSK's Net Run Rate (NRR).- If SRH (Sunrisers Hyderabad) loses both of their matches then both CSK and RCB have a chance to qualify.- RCB's qualification hinges on winning their last match, regardless of their Net Run Rate.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Delhi Capitals by 47 runs.

NEW DELHI: The inauguration of the newly constructed Nassau County International Cricket Stadium , situated near New York, took place on Wednesday, with the global cricketing body expressing its enthusiasm for expanding the sport's reach through the upcoming T20 World Cup in June.With a seating capacity of 34,000, the stadium boasts infrastructure reminiscent of the Las Vegas Formula 1 circuit, along with drop-in pitches prepared in Florida.Among its eight scheduled World Cup matches, the stadium is set to host the much-anticipated India-Pakistan encounter on June 9.The flagship 20-over tournament will be jointly hosted by the West Indies and the United States, commencing on June 1, with venues in New York, Florida, and Dallas. The International Cricket Council (ICC) is pleased with the attention surrounding the India-Pakistan clash and views the Nassau project as integral to expanding cricket's footprint in the US.""Yeah, absolutely! We can run that game anywhere and the interest in the fixture would be immense,"" Chris Tetley, the ICC's head of events, told reporters in a media roundtable.""The news stories that we have seen and the media coverage in the US itself as well as amongst the cricket media around the world.

NEW DELHI: Neeraj Chopra clinched another victory, albeit not in the manner he had hoped for, and he was candid in acknowledging it. Competing in India for the first time in over three years, the Olympic and world champion javelin thrower celebrated his return by securing the gold medal in the Federation Cup with a best throw of 82.27m on Wednesday.""I felt that I can compete here, and it was nice. However, let's not talk about the throw, it was not up to it,"" Chopra summed up his performance in the tournament.Having arrived in Bhubaneswar on the eve of his competition following a second-place finish in the Doha Diamond League , the 26-year-old superstar, renowned for his consistent performances over the past few years, didn't produce fireworks initially and found himself in second place after three rounds.However, Chopra surged ahead in the fourth round with a throw of 82.27m, securing the lead. He opted not to take his final two throws (fifth and sixth) as he was already in the lead after DP Manu's throw of 82.06m, earning Manu the silver medal.Among his mediocre outings, Chopra threw 80.24m in the IAAF Continental Cup in Ostrava, Czech Republic in September 2018.""The competition was quite good and the weather was warm. From the start, I was thinking if I feel good I will put effort accordingly. I came here after playing in Doha and there was not much recovery time and there was travel also, and I was not feeling that (good),"" Chopra said.""I gave my effort accordingly and did only four throws by passing on the last two throws as I have to compete in Ostrava (Czech Republic on May 28) in Golden Spike competition. There will be around 10 days to recover and compete.""I came to this kind of weather after a long time. The kind of enjoyment in a competition was not there. I was feeling the conditions were not that good, so I decided to stop after the fourth throw.""Asked about his famed consistency, Chopra said, ""Yeh toh consistent wali throw nahi hey (this one is not my consistent type of throw).""But I felt great to compete in India after a long time. I wanted to play in India and I performed according to the conditions, and the way my body was feeling. I have some big competitions coming up.""I thought DP Manu would take over but his javelin landed quickly. The result here did not matter much as the most important one is the Paris Olympics .""There was just a gap of four days between the Doha Diamond League and this event. Asked about the thought process to compete here, he said, ""We had a discussion that I would play in the National Inter-State Championships (June 27-30) and it's going to be held in Panchkula in Haryana but it was very near to the Paris Olympics.""Since I was playing in Doha which is near to India. Moreover, there is the Paris Diamond League (on July 7) between the National Inter-State and Olympics. So, we decided to compete here.""Chopra's upcoming schedule includes participation in the Golden Spike event in Ostrava, Czech Republic, followed by the Paavo Nurmi Games in Turku, Finland on June 18. These competitions will serve as crucial preparation for the Paris Olympics.""Further competition schedules will be decided later according to the situation and my body. Otherwise, I will go to Paris from there (after competing in Turku).""","Olympic and world champion Neeraj Chopra won gold in Bhubaneswar. Chopra threw 82.27m in the fourth round, securing the lead.

Punjab Kings secured a five-wicket victory over Rajasthan Royals on Wednesday, buoyed by an exceptional all-round performance from skipper Sam Curran. While the win provided Punjab with a consolation victory, it dealt a blow to Rajasthan's aspirations of clinching a top-two finish in the league stage, coming on the heels of their confirmation for a playoff spot just a day earlier.Rajasthan, who stay in second place with one game in hand, and table-toppers Kolkata Knight Riders are the only two teams to have booked their play-off berth.Despite Punjab's earlier exit from the playoff race, Curran's commanding display with both bat and ball highlighted their resilience and determination to finish the season on a positive note.With just five league games remaining in the season, here's all the IPL playoff scenarios for the last two remaining spots: KKR are now guaranteed to finish sole toppers of the league stage since no other team can catch them on 19 points* RR are guaranteed qualification even if they lose their last game. Their best case scenario is to finish second by winning their last game against KKR. Whether that will be sole second or joint second will depend on results in other games. If SRH win both their remaining games, they could join RR on 18 points and there’s not much separating the two teams on net run rate at the moment.* Third placed CSK are sure to finish among the top four teams on points, but are not assured of qualification. They could end up tied third with up to four other teams (DC, RCB, SRH and LSG) or tied fourth with up to three other teams (DC, RCB and LSG) depending on results in other games. What helps is their better net run rate at this stage than any of the other teams competing for the last two qualifying slots.* Fourth placed SRH too are sure to finish among the top four on points, but they too are not sure of qualification. They could find themselves in a tie with four other teams (DC, RCB, CSK and LSG) for third place if they lose both their remaining games. They could also end up in a three-way tie for fourth spot with DC and LSG . But even just one win from their two remaining games would guarantee qualification* Fifth placed DC’s chances of finishing among the top four on points, singly or jointly, are at 62.5%. But they are far from sure of qualifying. A third place finish on points would involve a four-way or five-way tie, while finishing fourth would mean a two-way to four-way tie depending on results in other games* Sixth placed RCB have a 50% chance of making it to the top four spots on points, singly or jointly. Their last game against CSK is a must-win, but even winning it is not enough. Other results will need to go their way* Seventh placed LSG, despite Tuesday’s loss to DC, are not out of it yet. They still have a 31% chance of finishing among the top four spots on points, singly or jointly. The bad news, however, is that finishing third would involve a five-way tie while ending up joint fourth would mean a three-way or four-way tie and their NRR is the worst among all the teams they could tie with* MI, PBKS and GT have already been knocked out",Punjab Kings beat Rajasthan Royals by five wickets on Wednesday.

Not just cricket, Virat Kohli has influenced the sporting world like none other over the past decade, which also played a role in cricket being included in the Olympic programme for the Los Angeles 2028 edition of the Games. And as the Indian batting icon's hunger for runs refuses to cease, it's quite natural for fans and experts to ask what keeps him going.The same question was thrown at the former India captain at RCB's Royal Gala Dinner ahead of their do-or-die IPL match against Chennai Super Kings in Bengaluru on May 18.Kohli and RCB skipper Faf du Plessis were on the stage, when Kohli answered a question on what keeps him hungry and going for more.""It's quite simple,"" said the 35-year-old Kohli. ""I think as a sportsman, we do have an end-date to our careers. So I am just working backwards. I don't want to finish my career thinking 'oh, what if I have done this on that particular day' because I can't keep going on and on forever. So it's just about not leaving any undone business behind and not have any regrets later, which I am sure I won't.""Kohli also hinted that he would take a long break before thinking about what next, once he has retired from cricket.""Once I am done, I will be gone, you won't see me for a while (smiles). So I want to give it everything I have till the time I play, and that's the only thing that keeps me going,"" he said.Kohli currently leads the chart of top run-scorers in the ongoing IPL 2024 . He has scored 661 runs in 13 innnings so far at a strike rate of 155.16 and averages 66.10. His tally includes five fifties and one hundred.RCB, who are currently No. 5 (12 points from 13 matches) on the IPL table, take on third-ranked CSK (14 points from 13 matches) this Saturday and must beat the five-time champions by a good margin to not just stay in contention for the playoffs but also go past CSK's net run rate (NRR).CSK's NRR currently is +0.528, while RCB have it at +0.387.",Virat Kohli says he will take a long break before thinking about what next.

CHENNAI: Cricket is at a crossroads with a part of the T20 World Cup in June taking place in the USA ahead of the sport's re-entry into the Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028.The world is waiting with bated breath to see how the public accepts cricket in the United States , which is a new market for the sport.For cricket in the US to be successful, the India-Pakistan game group league game on June 9 in the Nassau County Stadium, 35 kilometres east of Manhattan, must be a hit.And the ICC and United States Cricket have left no stone unturned to produce a stadium with a capacity of 34,000 in six months' time.The stadium, where eight matches will be played including three games featuring India, was inaugurated by legendary Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt on Wednesday.Ahead of the occasion, Chris Tetley, head of events, ICC, said that the ground meets international standards comfortably.""Whenever a new stadium comes up, there are a lot of questions about the size. But the Nassau County ground is not a token-sized ground - it is 75 yards east west and 67 yards north south from the centre. It is similar to the size of Wankhede . The drainage facilities, too, will be world-class,' Tetley said during an interaction.Not too long ago, it was just a municipality park and the ICC worked on war-footing to get the facility ready. Other than the four centre wickets, there are six practice pitches near the ground and drop-in pitches will be used for the tournament.The pitches have been prepared in Florida under the supervision of Damian Hough, head curator of Adelaide Oval, and have been brought to New York in trucks. Hough, who knows all about producing great wickets, says that it was a major challenge but they are happy with how things have shaped up.""The pitches will have pace and bounce and the ball should come on to the bat, something that the players prefer. The idea is to produce good pitches that will stay good throughout the tournament and the players will enjoy playing on,' Hough said.The galleries for the venue are makeshift. The temporary structure will be brought in from the Formula One track of Las Vegas and returned after the tournament is over.","Nassau County Stadium in New York will host the T20 World Cup in June.

The last time they won the IPL in 2023, they were losing the final - 2 balls, 10 runs. It was almost over and [Ravindra] Jadeja hit four and six to win the match. Dhoni himself is in form this time with the bat, and whoever bats with him usually plays a match-winning knock, especially in a do-or-die game,"" Kaif remarked.""Dhoni's formula in crunch games is - don't panic, take a breath and only he has this art in crunch matches. Lots of IPL captains came, but Dhoni's alertness in the crucial moments of the game is unmatched. He makes very few mistakes, that's why they are a champion team [Dhoni galtiyan kam karte hai, isliye champion team hai]. Because of this, CSK are favourites against RCB in the crucial league match,"" Kaif added.Echoing Kaif's sentiments, former India all-rounderIrfan Pathan highlighted Dhoni's exceptional form in the current season and the unpredictability he brings to the table. Pathan pointed out Dhoni's impressive statistics, including an average of 68 and a strike rate exceeding 200, along with his penchant for hitting sixes. He suggested that Dhoni might even alter his usual batting position if the situation demands it, underscoring the skipper's adaptability and potential to spring surprises.""This season he is on a roll, scoring 136 runs at 68 average and a strike rate of over 200 [226.66]. Has already hit 12 sixes. Every time he came to bat he has hit sixes. The special thing about CSK is that at the crucial time they played at a different level. You never know, Dhoni can do something he hasn't done in the season, so far he is coming in to bat in the last one or two overs,"" Pathan stated.RCB host CSK at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Saturday, with both needing a win to earn a spot in the IPL 2024 playoffs.With expectations running high and the spotlight firmly on Dhoni and CSK, cricket enthusiasts eagerly await the outcome of the clash, poised to witness whether the seasoned campaigner can once again weave his magic in the IPL arena.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru host Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League.

NEW DELHI: Captain Sam Curran led the charge with a well-paced fifty and two crucial wickets, guiding Punjab Kings to a five-wicket victory over Rajasthan Royals in their IPL encounter on Wednesday.Despite a modest target of 145, the Kings faced a challenge on a sluggish track. However, Curran's composed innings of 63 not out off 41 balls, comprising five boundaries and three sixes, steered his team to their fifth win of the season, reaching 145/5 in 18.5 overs.Curran found a capable ally in Jitesh Sharma (22 off 20 balls), with whom he shared a fluent 63-run partnership for the fifth wicket.Despite suffering their fourth consecutive defeat, Rajasthan Royals maintained their second position on the table with 16 points, securing a spot in the playoffs.Punjab Kings' chase started on shaky ground as Prabhsimran Singh fell in the first over to Trent Boult. The team faced further setbacks when an impressive Avesh Khan (2/28) claimed two wickets in the fifth over.The right-arm pacer first plucked the important wicket of Rilee Rossouw, who played some strong shots in his 13-ball 22, and then jettisoned in-form Shashank Singh for a two-ball naught.Shashank failed to connect a fuller, straighter one from Avesh while attempting a flick, and the 141 kmph delivery thudded on his bat. Shashank did not even bother to use DRS as he walked away.Punjab gained some ground through the alliance between Curran and Jitesh, who smoked R Ashwin for two sixes.Curran too gave a dose of punishment to the veteran offie, lofting him for a wonderful six over extra cover.But the blossoming stand was snapped by Yuzvendra Chahal (2/31), leaving PBKS at 111 for five in the 16th over.However, Curran and Ashutosh Sharma (17 not out, 11 balls) knocked off the remaining runs without further drama.Earlier, despite a well-tuned 48 from local hero Riyan Parag, RR struggled against an array of accurate bowlers on a rather slow pitch, meandering to a sub-par 144 for nine.R Ashwin (28, 19b, 3x4, 1x6) and Parag (48, 34, 6x4) tried to accelerate during their 50-run stand for the fourth wicket but it could only bring in a temporary momentum for RR.In fact, lethargy had set in very early in the Rajasthan innings after the early loss of Jaiswal, who chopped a Curran (2/24) delivery back on to his stumps.Sanju Samson (18), who went past 500-run in a season for the first time in his IPL career, and Tom-Kohler Cadmore (18, 23b) stitched 36 runs for the second wicket but took six overs for it.But with Curran and Arshdeep finding a hint of swing and maintaining a good line, scoring was not an easy proposition for the RR batters.Eventually, Samson, who tried a hopping cut off pacer Nathan Ellis, gave a simple catch to Rahul Chahar at point in the seventh over.Cadmore too returned to the dugout in the next over, as his almighty heave off leg-spinner Chahar (2/26) could not progress beyond Jitesh in the deep.Those twin dismissals actually paved the way for the best phase in the Royals' innings as Ashwin and Parag pressed their foot on the right pedal.Ashwin displayed his batting skills, smashing Chahar for 17 runs in the 12th over that included a sequence of 6, 4, 4 and the first four was a stunning reverse scoop over backward point.But he could not further extend his innings, lofting Arshdeep to Shashank.Parag, usually a free-flowing batter, had to curb his flair in front of a hugely adoring home crowd because of the regular fall of wickets at the other end.But a late cut off Curran that sped to third man stood as a testament of his ability and timing as he also moved past the 500-run mark for the season, before getting trapped in front of the wicket by Harshal Patel.However, apart from conquering those little peaks the RR batters failed to slip into the top gear consistently.","Punjab Kings beat Rajasthan Royals by five wickets in their IPL encounter.

Pakistan will need to do a lot because this is a very skilled Indian team with a powerful bowling line-up and two good spinners,"" Misbah said on 'Star Sports Press Room' on Wednesday.""India has quality fast bowlers in (Jasprit) Bumrah, (Mohammed) Siraj and Hardik (Pandya). The Indian cricket team's quality has risen many folds. It will be difficult to break, mental attitude matters a lot and Australia handles the mental side the best way.""There is no pressure of excess baggage with Australia, and it needs to be seen how both India and Pakistan handle that pressure.""Misbah highlighted that Virat Kohli , known for his memorable performances against Pakistan, remains a significant threat for their team in the upcoming T20 World Cup.Despite ongoing discussions regarding Kohli's strike rate during the current IPL season, Misbah emphasised the former Indian captain's ability to influence matches with his batting prowess.""Kohli is going to be a big factor. He has damaged Pakistan many times. He enjoys supremacy over Pakistan mentally. He takes motivation from big occasions and not pressure,"" he said.""The Virat Kohli effect will definitely be there. He is a top-class cricketer. He is one player who can win you matches, strike rates don't matter. Good players take motivation from those voices or criticism.""Misbah-ul-Haq still vividly recalls the ill-fated scoop shot he attempted in the inaugural T20 World Cup final against India in 2007.With Pakistan requiring only six runs to secure victory from the last four balls, Misbah's decision to execute the scoop over fine leg proved fatal as S Sreesanth took the catch. Pakistan subsequently fell short, crumbling to 152 while chasing a target of 157, ultimately handing India the coveted trophy.But Misbah said that tournament was responsible for the rapid growth of T20 cricket .""In the 2007 T20 World Cup, all teams were not so serious. India handed captaincy to a young (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni. But the final between India and Pakistan, the greatest rivalry in the history of cricket.

(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: World's fastest man Usain Bolt on Wednesday expressed his preference for T20 cricket which aligns with his own reputation and comes as a no surprise.As a Jamaican who once aspired to be a fast bowler, Bolt believes that the fast-paced nature of T20s will continue to attract more fans from the Caribbean and around the globe, potentially surpassing the popularity of Test matches.Having retired from his illustrious athletics career in 2017, Bolt's magnetic personality remains as strong as ever.Now, as the ambassador for the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup, the legendary athlete is thrilled to be involved in the sport he loves, stating that he is ""living the dream.""Bolt's unparalleled achievements on the track, which include holding world records in the prestigious 100m and 200m events, have solidified his status as one of the greatest athletes in history. Seven years after his retirement, his influence and charisma continue to captivate audiences worldwide, making him an ideal ambassador for the exciting world of T20 cricket.One could sense a child-like excitement in him while talking about cricket as he headed towards the makeshift cricket stadium in New York, one of three T20 World Cup venues in American mainland and host to the India-Pakistan clash on June 9.""I grew up on cricket. My dad was a massive cricket fan and still is. It is something that I have always in my blood. To be actually get to be a part of cricket again as an ambassador, it is wonderful. I never got to live my dream of being a cricketer so to be ambassador of T20 World Cup is wonderful,"" Bolt told PTI from New York.He has spent the last months travelling the world for music and football among other things and therefore, he has not got the time to watch live cricket on the TV.He knows the IPL is on but his schedule has not allowed him to binge watch.""I have not been able to watch as much as I would like to but when I get time I try to catch up on T20s,"" said the 'Lightning Bolt'.Speed continues to excite Bolt the most and no wonder he calls T20 the best format of the game.""T20s for sure... When they started it was a great idea and still is. It compresses the game because you have to also be strong and quick but also be strategic, set a field and get things done quick. To me it combines Test match and one day together to create the perfect game.""Bolt is not the only one in the Caribbean who is attracted towards the shortest format. The same goes for its elite cricketers who are now admired more for their exploits in T20 leagues than what they do in West Indian colours.Amid the T20 boom, Test cricket faces a grave threat in the region and Bolt too only sees a bright future of the slam-bang format.""I think the T20s and one dayers (ODIs) are still massive in the Caribbean. People actually don't enjoy Test cricket that much. It is all about the speed of the game, big hitters like Andre Russell, so for me that is the direction that is going in (game is going in the Caribbean).""It will bring more people to watch the sport. Because people love excitement. That is the key,"" he said.USA is hosting a global cricket event for the first time and despite being a game that is played by South Asian and Caribbean expats at the moment, Bolt believes the local American community will get involved with the game.""I surely think the game can grow in USA. When you have presence in a country people start gravitating towards it and want to know more about.""Bolt may not have a lot of free time at his disposal but growing up in Jamaica, he watched plenty of cricket with his father. Visuals of Wasim Akram castling the batters with his inswinging yorkers remain fresh in his memory.""Over the years, one of my favourites growing up was Wasim Akram because of the inswinging yorker that he had. Of course Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose all these guys that I admired over the years, they were so dominant in their space.""Did he like anyone in the Indian team?""Like my father, I always support the West Indies (laughs). But yes, I have also been a Sachin Tendulkar fan. He and Brian Lara was part of my life growing up. It was a great rivalry,"" he said referring to the two legendary batters.Among the current lot, Bolt says ""Kohli is the standout one for sure"".When asked if there a cricketer who has the slightest potential of being a sprinter, the showman in Bolt came to the fore.""We have a running joke right now, me and Chris Gayle (both are close friends), he said actually he can beat me over 100 metres. We are looking to put out a race and see what happens (laughs).""When it comes to speed I am the best, I don't think there is any cricketer right now that can challenge me (laughs),"" said Bolt, who is looking forward to return to India in the near future.His last visit to the country was in 2014.",Usain Bolt is the ambassador for the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup. The Jamaican believes T20s will continue to attract more fans from the Caribbean and around the globe. Bolt says he has not been able to watch as much as he would like to but when he get time he tries to catch up.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110156525,imgsize-28264,width-400,resizemode-4/110156525.jpg"

But despite falling, he somehow held onto the ball, leaving his Rajasthan Royals teammates and bowler Trent Boult pleasantly surprised.The incident took place in the first over of Punjab's chase when Prabhsimran tried to smack Boult on the on-side but the top edge made the ball go straight up and towards short third-man.Stationed inside the circle, Chahal back pedalled and was all over the place while keeping his eyes on the ball.

NEW DELHI: Despite a valiant 48 from local hero Riyan Parag , Rajasthan Royals struggled to find their rhythm against a disciplined bowling attack on a sluggish pitch, finishing at a below-par total of 144 for nine against Punjab Kings in their IPL match in Guwahati on Wednesday.The Rajasthan innings began with a setback as Yashasvi Jaiswal was dismissed early, chopping a delivery from Sam Curran onto his stumps.Although Sanju Samson and Tom-Kohler Cadmore stitched together a 36-run partnership for the second wicket, their progress was slow, taking six overs to accumulate those runs.Despite some occasional eye-catching shots, particularly Cadmore's towering six over deep mid-wicket and Samson's elegant backfoot punch through covers, the Punjab Kings bowlers, especially Curran and Arshdeep Singh, maintained tight lines and made scoring difficult.The dismissal of Samson, who attempted a cut shot off Nathan Ellis and was caught at point, triggered a mini-collapse. Cadmore fell soon after, attempting a big shot off leg-spinner Rahul Chahar.However, the partnership between R Ashwin and Riyan Parag injected some momentum into the Rajasthan innings. Ashwin displayed his batting prowess with some aggressive strokes, including a stunning reverse scoop over backward point.Parag, though forced to rein in his natural aggression due to wickets falling at the other end, showcased his skill with a well-timed late cut off Curran.Both Ashwin and Parag surpassed the 500-run mark for the season, with Parag becoming the second uncapped Indian player to achieve this milestone in IPL history, following in the footsteps of his teammate Yashasvi Jaiswal from the previous season.Despite these individual efforts, Rajasthan Royals failed to consistently accelerate and were dealt a blow when Harshal Patel dismissed Parag lbw, ending any hopes of a late surge.",Rajasthan Royals bowled out for 144 in their IPL match against Punjab Kings.

NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe , playing his final home game for Paris Saint-Germain , scored in a surprising 3-1 loss to Toulouse on the night PSG received the Ligue 1 trophy.Despite Mbappe's early goal, his 44th of the season across all competitions, Toulouse quickly equalized through Thijs Dallinga. PSG fielded a heavily rotated side following their Champions League semi-final exit to Borussia Dortmund , with Mbappe being the sole player to retain his place.Yann Gboho's stunning strike put Toulouse ahead in the second half, and Frank Magri sealed the victory in added time, handing PSG only their second league defeat this season and first in 27 matches since September.Mbappe, who confirmed his departure from PSG when his contract expires at the end of the season, is expected to join Real Madrid next. He leaves PSG as the club's all-time leading scorer with 256 goals since joining from Monaco in 2017 for a fee of 180 million euros ($194 million).PSG had already secured a record-extending 12th French title and their 10th in 12 years before the match against Toulouse. The celebrations following the game were intended to focus on their title triumph rather than serving as a specific tribute to Mbappe. PSG can still complete a domestic treble by winning the French Cup final against Lyon on May 25, having already claimed the Champions Trophy, France's equivalent of the Super Cup.In other Ligue 1 action, Monaco secured second place and direct qualification for next season's Champions League with a 2-0 victory at Montpellier. Lille moved into third, level on points with Brest, after a 2-1 win at Nantes, with Jonathan David scoring both goals.
