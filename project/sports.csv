(English translation: You lose more than winning. When will you show some performance? You guys only talk in the air, don't actually do anything. Now it seems you come like tourists, play in whatever way, and go back. I am done. You guys have turned this into a joke.)

Pakistan almost got over the line until Haris Rauf was hit for a four over mid-off to tie the scores, which took their Group A game against co-hosts USA in the T20 World Cup on Thursday to a 'Super Over'. But Babar Azam & Co wilted under pressure in the tie-breaker and succumbed to an upset defeat that US cricket will remember for the time to come.After both the teams ended up scoring 159, the 'Super Over' decided the winner, where USA (18 runs) beat the Pakistan team (13 runs).The defeat understandably disappointed Pakistan fans, experts and former cricketers, who were heartbroken after their team's deplorable performance.""Ek hi dil hai, kitni baar todoge (just one heart, how many times will you break it)? "" said a Pakistan woman of British origin, questioning the Pakistan team ""Jetate kum hain, haarte zyada hain...aap kab performance dikhayenge?...aap bas hawa mei baatein karte hain, kuchh dikhate to nahi hain...Ab to aise lag raha hai ke bas jaise aap ghoomne aate hain aur jaise taise khel ke chale jaate hain...Meri literally bas ho gayi hai..aap logon nei mazak samjha hua hai,"" the fan, almost on the verge of tears, lamented.Saurabh Netravalkar , an engineer from Mumbai who has now settled in the US, bowled the Super Over for USA, and held his nerves far better than the experienced Mohammad Amir, who was erratic with his line and conceded 7 runs as wides in the tie-breaker.USA, who now have two wins from as many matches and sit on top of Group A, registered their second T20I win over a Test-playing nation in under a month.

Early Struggles

Man of The Moment

NEW DELHI: Where dreams are woven with every delivery, Saurabh Netravalkar etched his name in history with a spellbinding performance that propelled Team USA to a stunning victory over former champions Pakistan in Dallas in the ongoing T20 World Cup 2024.While defending 18 runs in the Super Over, the cricketer-turned-engineer Netravalkar defied all odds and shattered the expectations of hundreds and thousands of Pakistanis on Thursday.ALSO SEE: T20 World Cup Schedule In 2010, Netravalkar donned the Indian jersey at the U19 World Cup, where a young Babar's Pakistan dashed their hopes. The loss was a bitter pill.Fast forward 14 years, Netravalkar, now a cornerstone of the USA team, scripted a poetic reversal at the 2024 T20 World Cup . Bowling a sensational Super Over, he led the USA to a stunning victory over Babar's Pakistan.Born in Mumbai, India, Netravalkar's journey began with a love for the game that burned brighter than the city's neon lights. A part of the India U19 setup and a domestic cricketer for Mumbai, he faced the harsh reality of intense competition that often overshadows talent in a cricket-obsessed nation. Undeterred, he embarked on a path less travelled, seeking opportunities beyond the boundaries of his homeland.It was in the United States that Netravalkar found his calling, embracing the challenge of representing a nation where cricket was still finding its footing. With a towering frame and a quirky left-arm pace, he possessed the ability to extract disconcerting bounce and movement, leaving batters perplexed and stumps scattered.Netravalkar's journey was not without its obstacles. Balancing his passion for cricket with his profession as a Senior Software Engineer at Oracle, he navigated the complexities of odd work hours and tours, coding on team buses and squeezing in practice sessions whenever possible.Yet, his unwavering dedication and love for the game fueled his pursuit of excellence.On Thursday, Netravalkar stepped onto the field after a promising start to his T20 World Cup campaign against Canada on the opening day, with his eyes burning with determination.Pakistan, a formidable force in the cricketing world, had set a challenging target of 159 runs. Team USA, considered underdogs, rose to the occasion, matching Pakistan's score and forcing a nerve-wracking Super Over.It was in this crucible of pressure that Netravalkar's true mettle was forged. With the world watching, he delivered a sensational over, restricting Pakistan to a mere 13 runs for the loss of one wicket. The stage was set for the United States to etch their name in the annals of cricketing history, and Netravalkar's heroics paved the way for a famous victory.With every delivery, Netravalkar etches his name deeper into the pages of cricketing lore, proving that passion, perseverance and an unwavering spirit can conquer even the mightiest of foes.","Saurabh Netravalkar led Team USA to a stunning victory over former champions Pakistan in Dallas.

T20 World Cup not Lok Sabha Election: How the other Nitish Kumar made a huge impact,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/t20-world-cup-not-lok-sabha-election-how-the-other-nitish-kumar-made-a-huge-impact/articleshow/110791314.cms,"Forcing a Super Over against Pakistan





Who is Nitish Kumar?





In the recent Indian General Election, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar ’s performance in the Lok Sabha 2024 Election turned out to be crucial for the NDA. He might have won only 12 seats, but he is now a crucial ally in the NDA. Similarly, his namesake in the USA cricket team played an important role in ensuring the USA slayed Pakistan in the 2024 T20 World Cup .Nitish Kumar might not have been in the best of forms but like his namesake, the small performance made a huge difference. Of course it came in Texas instead of Bihar. Kumar scored only 14 runs in 14 balls, but he scored a crucial boundary to force matters and push the match into a Super over where the US made history by defeating Pakistan. In many ways, it was reminiscent of a bunch of amateur footballers from USA in 1950 defeating England at the World Cup.Co-hosts the United States caused a massive upset in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, stunning former champions Pakistan by five runs in a Super Over after their encounter ended in a tie at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas. Electing to field first, the USA restricted Pakistan to 159/7 and then matched the score, producing a brilliant run-chase to take Pakistan into a Super Over. With Nitish Kumar hitting a boundary off the last ball bowled by Haris Rauf, USA reached 159/3 in 20 overs and tied the scores.In the Super Over, Mohammed Amir was directionless and bowled three wides as Aaron Jones and Harmeet Singh scored 18/1 in six balls. Aaron Jones was run out for 11 off the last ball of the One-Over Eliminator. Saurabh Netravalkar defended that despite being struck for a four off the second ball by Iftikhar. He too bowled two wides. He, however, got Iftikhar out for four with Nitish Kumar picking up a superb catch as Pakistan needed seven runs off the last ball but could manage only two, losing the match by five runs.This is the USA's second victory in Group A after they started with a win against Canada in the tournament lung-opener on June 1. Pakistan lost their first match and will take on arch-rivals India on Sunday in New York. Chasing 160 for victory, opener Steven Taylor departed for 12 (16) in the final over of the Powerplay, as USA scored 44/1. Skipper Monank Patel and Andries Gous put Pakistan on the back foot with a brilliant 69-run partnership for the second wicket that moved the tournament co-hosts into treble figures and seemingly in control of the run chase. Monank was particularly impressive, hitting a classy half-century to give his side hope. He scored an exact 50 off 38 balls, hitting seven boundaries and one six, while Gous scored 35 off 26 balls.However, Pakistan’s four-pronged pace attack hit back, removing both set batters to set up a nervy finale at the Grand Prairie Stadium. Haris Rauf cleaned up Gous (35 from 26) to get the crucial breakthrough. And, an over later, Mohammad Amir had the excellent Patel caught behind for 50 from 38 to give Pakistan hope. Despite a fine knock from Aaron Jones, Pakistan had moved to the brink of victory, thanks to a classic display of death bowling. But USA hammered 11 runs off the final three deliveries of the innings, with Nitish Kumar slamming the last ball for four to force a Super Over and send the home crowd delirious in Dallas.Born in Scarborough, Ontario in 1994, Nitish Kumar is an all-rounder who played almost all of Canada’s matches in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup qualifiers. He holds the record for being the youngest player to debut for Canada in a first-class match when he played in the ICC Intercontinental Cup Fixture against Kenya in August 2009. He is also the second-youngest ODI player (15 years and 273 days), only bettered by Pakistan’s Hasan Raza. Kumar later swapped colours and started representing the US national team. In this year’s T20 World Cup, he is representing the USA.Incidentally, Nitish Kumar’s middle name is Roenick, a tribute to National Hockey League star Jeremy Roenick . Incidentally, Kumar played for Canada in the 2011 World Cup when here became the tournament’s youngest player. Kumar even captained Canada and last played for the team 2019. He recently made his debut for the US national side and is part of the T20 World Cup squad being held in US soil. He is also expected to face off against India when the two nations meet on June 12.With inputs from agencies","Co-hosts the United States caused a massive upset in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, stunning former champions Pakistan by five runs in a Super Over after their encounter ended in a tie.

In a stunning upset at the Guyana National Stadium on Friday, Afghanistan dominated a lackluster New Zealand, claiming the top spot in Group C at the T20 World Cup with an emphatic 84-run victory, which is also their first ever against the Kiwis in T20 internationals.Chasing a challenging target of 160, New Zealand faltered, collapsing to 75 all out in 15.2 overs.Rahmanullah Gurbaz set the stage for Afghanistan with a commanding 80 off 56 balls, supported by Ibrahim Zadran's 44, as they amassed 159 for six after being put in to bat. Their opening partnership of 103 by the 15th over laid a solid foundation for their challenging total.Fazalhaq Farooqi , continuing his stellar performance from the opening match against Uganda, wreaked havoc on the New Zealand batting lineup, claiming four crucial wickets for just 17 runs.Captain Rashid Khan , the champion leg-spinner, mirrored Farooqi's figures, also taking four wickets for 17 runs, including a pivotal dismissal of Kane Williamson with his first ball, effectively sealing the fate of the match.""We've been waiting for this moment for about three years,"" said a delighted 'Player of the Match' Gurbaz. ""We have the trust and belief that we can beat any team in this competition on this type or surface. At the start of the innings our target was around 130-140 and we played our part in getting there, but credit must go to the bowlers as well. To do this against a team like New Zealand...it's unbelievable"".New Zealand's evident collapse and apparent lack of form present a daunting task for the 2021 finalists as they gear up to face hosts West Indies at the Brian Lara Stadium in Trinidad next Wednesday.""This just wasn't good enough in terms of starting a tournament. It's very frustrating,"" admitted Williamson, reflecting on a forgettable night for New Zealand cricket.""We have to move on quickly from this because the matches now come thick and fast for us. Yes, we have to learn from so much that went wrong without over-analysing, but we have to turn it around as quickly as we can,"" he added.Williamson's somber demeanor stood in sharp contrast to his Afghanistan counterpart Rashid, who provided a perspective on the result.""It is one of the greatest performances for us in T20's against a big team like New Zealand,"" said Rashid.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal has labeled India's decision to open with Virat Kohli in the T20 World Cup as a significant mistake.In India's tournament opener against Ireland, Kohli, as an opener, was dismissed cheaply, scoring just 1 run off 5 balls. Despite this, the Indian team management appears set to continue with this batting order for their crucial match against Pakistan on Sunday.Akmal expressed his disagreement with this strategy, suggesting that Kohli should be positioned at No. 3, where he can anchor the innings and guide the team through the middle overs.""I don't think the batting order is correct. Virat Kohli can take the pressure at No.3 and finish the match. That is very important for Team India. Yashasvi Jaiswal should open the batting. Kohli should come at 3. If India stick to this batting order (of Kohli) opening, then they may get stuck at some point. Kohli holds one end up and finishes off the game.

In the recently concluded IPL, Kohli won the Orange Cap, scoring 741 runs at a strike rate of 154.India delivered a comprehensive performance in their first match of the tournament, but their real test lies ahead against Pakistan. The Pakistan team, reeling from a shock defeat to the USA, will be eager to bounce back.""India will be confident. Bumrah bowled well, Siraj did well. Hardik Pandya also got wickets.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan captain Salman Butt did not hold back his criticism of Haris Rauf following the fast bowler's performance in Pakistan's T20 World Cup match against the USA in Dallas, Texas.Rauf, who was entrusted with bowling the final over with the USA needing 15 runs to win, faltered under pressure, leading to a dramatic finish.Butt expressed his frustration with Rauf on the ' Cricket Baithak' podcast, emphasizing the fast bowler's apparent lack of awareness and failure to bowl to the field.""It is not a surprise that he conceded so many runs because he is that kid who doesn't look at his field at all. Mid-off is inside the circle, and yet he bowls full and gets hit for a boundary on the last ball. You can see the captain also screamed at him.

NEW DELHI: When asked if the IPL auction crosses his mind, Saurabh Netravalkar simply laughs on the other end of the phone before emphatically stating, ""No,"" in a resonant baritone.Netravalkar played a pivotal role in newcomers' USA's remarkable victory over former champions Pakistan in the T20 World Cup on Thursday.""It is just one match and we have done well.The focus should be on the next game and frankly speaking, all of us in the United States of America cricket team, are trying to come to terms with our achievements.""It is yet to sink in and things you are talking about, if it happens organically, it will happen. We are still trying to digest what happened,"" the former India U-19 left-arm pacer, who made the difference with a brilliant Super Over against Pakistan, told PTI in an exclusive interview on Friday.An alumnus of prestigious Cornell University and a senior software engineer at Oracle , Netravalkar adeptly balanced academics and cricket.""I have never felt the pressure. When you love something, it is never a job for you. So when I am out there on the field, I love bowling and trying to out-think a batter. When I am coding , I love doing that and hence it never feels like work,"" the left-arm seamer, who has suddenly become the talk of the town, couldn't have put it more lucidly.""Actually, we just flew down from Dallas to New York. I will be honest that it has been quite overwhelming. I wish I could personally thank each and everyone for their lovely messages. I feel blessed,"" one could sense the gratitude in his voice.What was the strategy for the Super Over, and when did he find out he would be bowling?""It wasn't pre-decided and only after the regulation 20 overs did skipper (Monank Patel) and coach (Stuart Law) informed me about it. I am thankful to them for showing faith in me.""He then gave an insight into the US strategy.""The plan was simple that I will try and bowl wide yorkers to the right handers and try to keep it out of his range as the boundary on that side was bigger. First ball the batter shifted and didn't get a wide and second ball, he stayed rooted and connected, and then, I got a couple of wides, as I was trying for wide lines.""But I must say that 18 runs helped and all those extra runs that Harmeet (Singh) and Aaron (Jones) ran, helped. Basically, if you are defending around 20, all you need is three good balls, and the job is done. It is one of the best matches I have played.""However, Netravalkar would matter-of-factly state that while opportunities in professional cricket are improving in the US, his primary source of income remains his day job at Oracle.""The best part is that I have got very supportive bosses at Oracle and I am allowed to work remotely when I am on tour, playing for the United States.""So on match days, I am excused from work but then there are scheduled project meetings which warrants my presence and then I work my practice schedule accordingly. I would also thank US Cricket board as they also are flexible if I have meetings lined up.""His is a fascinating story.""I can tell you that when I play local matches or club games in the United States, I have often logged in for a meeting at the lunch break and people have been very accommodating.""At Oracle, they all know by now I play cricket and everyone is happy to support. I work in team Oracle text and I am primarily a coder, who works on SQL and C (programming languages),"" he said.What are the prospects of a full-time cricket career in the United States?""Well, if you have a Major League Contracts, those are good and you can have a full-time cricket career.""Minor League Cricket is also seeing an upswing but another avenue is some weekend 'Pop-Up' tournaments, basically played from Friday to Sunday in Houston, Florida where you can actually earn well.""Come June 12, and Netravalkar will be facing the Indian team and he is quite emotional about it.""I know all of them and Surya (Yadav) and myself have played together for Mumbai U15s, U-17, U-19s. It is so good to see what he has achieved and it will be nice to catch up with them.

NEW DELHI: Skipper Brian Masaba and the Uganda cricket team celebrated their first-ever victory at the Twenty20 World Cup with style and exuberance, marking a significant milestone for the nation's cricketing journey.In a low-scoring thriller against Papua New Guinea , Uganda secured a dramatic three-wicket win, which they celebrated with their unique brand of joy and gratitude.The match, held in the Caribbean, saw Uganda bowl out PNG for a meager 77 runs. Despite the low target, Uganda's chase was fraught with challenges. They faced a precarious situation early on, losing their first three wickets in just 2.1 overs and further slumping to 26/5 by the seventh over.However, Riazat Ali Shah's composed 33 and Juma Miyagi's supportive 13 helped stabilize the innings. Their crucial 35-run partnership for the sixth wicket steered Uganda towards the finish line, achieving the target with 10 balls and three wickets to spare in only their second game at a T20 World Cup .Following the victory, the Ugandan team lined up on the boundary rope to bow and acknowledge the fans who had traveled from Africa to support them. This heartfelt gesture was a tribute to their supporters and a testament to their unity and gratitude.Their celebration didn't stop there. A video capturing their joyous song and dance on the field quickly went viral on social media, showcasing the team's infectious enthusiasm and the historic nature of their triumph.""First win at the World Cup — doesn't get more special than this,"" Masaba said after the match. ""I'm super proud of this group, the work they put in. To get a win for their country at a World Cup, it's pretty special.""Uganda's journey to this historic win included navigating through the African qualifying stages, ultimately securing their spot in the 20-team global tournament at the expense of Zimbabwe, a long-time full member of the International Cricket Council.","Uganda secured a dramatic three-wicket win against Papua New Guinea.

NEW DELHI: After a respectable first-class career, some were looking for greener pastures; others were hoping for a second chance at life; and still others were just talented enough to be forced to find an obscure cricket ground on a weekend.Meet the stars of the USA's T20 World Cup debut, which shocked the cricket world by defeating Pakistan, the finalists of the previous edition, in Dallas:The team's captain, who was born in Ahmedabad, is one of the few individuals who moved to essentially pursue his cricketing career. He was awarded player of the match for his half century. In 2010, he obtained a Green Card, and in 2016, he moved permanently to New Jersey.A powerful right-hander, when he's not playing for his country, he also teaches cricket to kids living abroad three times a week and runs coaching clinics. Turf wickets were scarce in the USA at first, and Monank has participated in numerous 20- and 30-over weekend club events throughout the nation in addition to playing a lot of matting cricket.Netravalkar is the epitome of a happy union between academia and athletics. He rose to prominence following a brilliant Super Over, and before that he squared up Mohammed Rizwan with an away swinger and tricked Iftikhar Ahmed with a low sinking slow full-toss.During the 2010 World Cup in New Zealand, he faced some of the best U-19 English cricket players, including Joe Root, Jos Buttler, and Ben Stokes. Known as ""Netra"" at the time, he combined well with fellow left-arm seamer Jaydev Unadkat and Sandeep Sharma of Punjab.But just like in Mumbai, one must be the best in order to live; being good is insufficient. The academically gifted young man, who already had an engineering degree in computer science, was awarded a scholarship to study for an MS at Cornell University.But sport never left him. To establish himself, he competed at all levels of US cricket and put on a respectable performance in Major League sport's inaugural season, which featured several of the best T20 players in the world.He works as a senior technologist at Oracle's Silicon Valley division, away from cricket.As with many young talents, he lost his way, but Ian Chappell wanted him to be inducted into the Indian team after his performances in the 2012 U-19 World Cup. When he was caught by the police driving inside a train station, rumors about his lack of discipline spread quickly, and Mumbai cricket turned its back on him.As a professional, he relocated to Tripura, but he had little luck there. He made the wise decision to immigrate to the United States. Including a recent series against Bangladesh, he has been among the most reliable players since finding his groove again. With the ball in Rizwan's hands, he swiped extra runs during the Super Over.Not sure if Kenjige has heard the well-known country song ""I come from Alabama"" by Stephen C. Foster, the father of American music, but being born in that well-known Southeast, Kenjige's story as a Tamil-American is intriguing.He used to be a left-arm medium pacer before learning to spin at the age of thirteen. He had moved to Ooty with his parents when he was a young child. Kenjige's parents sent him to Bengaluru when he was eighteen years old, where he participated in the KSCA's first division league.But after realizing how difficult it was to even get into the Karnataka state side, he made the decision to return home and enrol in a bio-medical engineering program.When he went for the United States, he had given up playing cricket and had not even bothered to pack his equipment. However, a cricket ball that his mother had hidden in his suitcase changed everything. After landing a position in Washington, DC, he played squash in the evenings and learned about club cricket in New York.After that, he quit his position as a Bio-Medical officer and joined the USA's WCL Division 4 team.When Milind Kumar first arrived, everyone in the Delhi circuit scene thought he was a good talent. However, after seven years, he was reduced to a supporting role and frequently left to bat with the tail in Ranji Trophy matches. Moving to Sikkim in the Plate League and scoring over 1300 runs did not prove to be the lucky break he had hoped for.He moved to the US after COVID-19 and performed well in local competitions to secure a spot in the 15. He was an excellent fielder, even for Delhi, and Iftikhar Ahmed would have learned his lesson the hard way in the Super Over. Pakistan's aspirations were dashed by the catch, leaping forward after racing ten yards from the long-off boundary.Whether you live in India or the US, now is a great time to be a Nitish Kumar. School-going Nitish set a world record in 2011 when MS Dhoni struck that massive six-ball to win the World Cup and Virat Kohli was just starting to make waves as the next big thing. At 16 years old, Nitish played a 50-over World Cup match for Canada against Zimbabwe, becoming the youngest player to do so.His moment of glory came thirteen years ago when he hit the boundary off Haris Rauf's final delivery. As Ian Bishop would have said: ""Remember the Name, Nitish Kumar.""Jessy, who was born in New Jersey, raised in a rural Punjabi household, and is currently in his teens, has spent a considerable amount of time in the land of opportunity.He was left out of the US squad that traveled to the West Indies to compete in a domestic 50 over competition in 2015. In order to double his practice hours, Jessy left everything.Former US coach Pubudu Dassanayeke organized five first-class matches in Sri Lanka in 2016, which is where he discovered the value of perseverance. He has become an essential member of Pakistani Ali Khan's speed attack over the last few years. Without a doubt, the delivery that struck Babar Azam out was the best of his career thus far.","The stars of the USA's T20 World Cup debut, which shocked the cricket world by defeating Pakistan, the finalists of the previous edition, in Dallas.

NEW DELHI: Former captain Inzamam-ul-Haq has emphasized the importance of the Pakistani cricket team focusing solely on their imminent match against India in the ongoing T20 World Cup in New York.

It's not like Pakistan cannot defeat India, they should keep everything aside and focus the game on Sunday. Everybody should believe that they can win the match. Everybody should try to win the game for Pakistan. Your body language and belief changes when you have confidence,"" Inzamam said on his YouTube channel.Pakistan's performance in the current edition of the World Cup has not mirrored their high-ranking status from the previous tournament, as they entered as the seventh-ranked T20I team. This decline has been attributed to frequent changes in management and an inconsistent lineup, particularly affecting the middle order.Shadab Khan , who has been a key player in Pakistan's batting lineup, has recently been underperforming, which was highlighted by his minimal run contribution against England and his less effective bowling.Furthermore, Inzamam has suggested that Abrar Ahmed be considered for inclusion in the team, pointing out the need for effective contributions from all players. ""Abrar should be given a chance, if six batters don't score then the seventh one can't save the game for you. Shadab is struggling with the ball,"" he added.","Former captain Inzamam-ul-Haq has emphasized the importance of the Pakistani cricket team focusing solely on their imminent match against India.

So, India have the advantage and they are playing well also,"" he added.Harbhajan also identified key players who could influence the outcome of the India-Pakistan clash. "" Jasprit Bumrah and Suryakumar Yadav will make the maximum impact in the upcoming match against Pakistan.

Afghanistan (Playing XI):

(Inputs from AFP)

NEW DELHI: New Zealand's captain, Kane Williamson , won the toss and elected to field first against Afghanistan in the T20 World Cup Group C encounter held at the Guyana National Stadium.This decision set the stage for a keenly anticipated match-up. Afghanistan has been gaining recognition for their formidable presence in the white ball formats of international cricket This was evident from their commanding 125-run victory over Uganda, a team making its debut in the tournament, in their opening match at the same venue.Despite this strong start, Afghanistan was compelled to adjust their lineup due to Mujeeb ur Rahman , a pivotal spinner in their squad, being sidelined by a persistent hand injury. Noor Ahmad , another talented spinner from their ranks, was chosen to fill Rahman's spot for this crucial game.New Zealand, on the other hand, arrived at this tournament with high expectations, having finished as runners-up in the 2021 edition. Their campaign in the current tournament began almost a week after its commencement, marking a significant period of anticipation for the team and its supporters.In a notable selection decision, New Zealand opted to exclude Rachin Ravindra , one of their emerging batting talents, from their playing XI for this match. Mark Chapman was selected in Ravindra’s stead, indicating the team's strategy and preference for this particular game.The context of this match is framed by the contrasting yet compelling narratives of both teams. Afghanistan's recent ascendancy in international cricket, particularly in the shorter formats, has been a storyline of growing interest. Their ability to deliver decisive victories, as demonstrated against Uganda, underscores their potential to challenge established cricketing nations.New Zealand's consistent performance at the highest levels, including their near miss in the previous T20 World Cup, positions them as one of the favorites and adds an intriguing dynamic to the encounter.Finn Allen, Devon Conway(w), Kane Williamson(c), Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Phillips, Mark Chapman, Michael Bracewell, Mitchell Santner, Matt Henry, Trent Boult, Lockie FergusonRahmanullah Gurbaz(w), Ibrahim Zadran, Najibullah Zadran, Mohammad Nabi, Gulbadin Naib, Azmatullah Omarzai, Rashid Khan(c), Karim Janat, Noor Ahmad, Naveen-ul-Haq, Fazalhaq Farooqi.","Afghanistan beat New Zealand in T20 World Cup Group C encounter.

NEW DELHI: Canada skipper Saad Bin Zafar on Friday acknowledged that the pitch at the Nassau County ground slowed down in the second half of their T20 World Cup match against Ireland, which they managed to win by 12 runs.Canada posted 137 for 7 in the first innings and then restricted Ireland to 125 for seven, securing their maiden victory in the tournament.Zafar attributed their success to the decision to include an extra spinner, praising the performances of both himself and Junaid Siddiqui.The pitch at this venue has been under scrutiny for its challenging batting conditions, with low-scoring games being the norm, especially with the highly anticipated clash between India and Pakistan scheduled for Sunday.""The wicket got a bit slow today, so it worked to our advantage. We gambled with an extra spinner and I feel both myself and Junaid (Siddiqui) bowled really well,"" Zafar said at the post-match presentation.The pitch at this venue has been in spotlight for being tough to bat on, since it has produced very low-scoring games with the mega clash between India and Pakistan coming up on Sunday.Zafar, meanwhile, hoped that Canada will be able to carry the momentum into their next game against Pakistan.""One game at a time, we need to enjoy this win and come back strong against Pakistan. We are here to play positive cricket,"" Zafar said while talking about his team's show.Describing their win as a ""proud moment"", Zafar praised his side for a unified show.""(It's a) very proud moment for the team. The way Kirton and Movva batted, we knew we had a good total to defend. We needed a good performance from the bowling unit and I am so proud of my bowlers for putting their hand up and delivering,"" he said.Ireland skipper Paul Stirling, whose batting struggles continued with a meager score of nine, acknowledged that his team was not at their best and hoped for improvement in all aspects of the game.""(It was a) tough loss, we weren't at the races today. The target was gettable and we didn't think we'd struggle too much,"" he said.""We were off in all three facets today, we need to show a better game when we go to Miami and Florida. We don't want to look too far into the future, we've got USA next,"" Stirling added.Nicholas Kirton, who played a match-winning knock of 49 off 35 balls, emphasized the importance of Canada bouncing back after their heavy defeat against the USA in the tournament opener.He found the pitch to be generally good for batting, with only a small area in the middle causing some inconsistency.""Bouncing back from the first game was important. Trust me, it wasn't that easy. (I) just tried to get in, get the pace of the wicket. Honestly it wasn't that bad. There was an area in the middle of the wicket that was a bit up and down, but otherwise it was a good wicket to bat on,"" he said.""(It is) very good to get our first win in the World Cup. Hopefully we can continue from strength to strength. Our next focus is Pakistan. Two spinners bowled very well (as there was a) bit of purchase on offer,"" he added.(With inputs from PTI)","Canada posted 137 for 7 in the first innings and then restricted Ireland to 125 for seven, securing their maiden victory in the tournament.

KOLKATA: With his hands on the hip, Sunil Chhetri stood a little distance away from the pack of his teammates in the middle of the park. He stood motionless, as if dazed, for a few seconds, his eyes blank and without expression.

A few minutes ago, Chinese referee Fu Ming had blown the whistle to seal India's goalless draw with Kuwait in their second-round fixture of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, thus ringing the curtain on Chhetri's 19-year-old career in the Blue Tigers jersey.

Suddenly the Salt Lake Stadium stands roared into ""Chhetri, Chhteri"" chants, stirring the 39-year-old out of his trance as he was given a standing ovation He began a lap of honour around the ground. Then he broke down in tears as his teammates, coach Igor Stimac and his coaching staff members lined up to give him the guard of honour. After plethora of hugs and handshakes, he slowly walked down the tunnel, out of everyone's sight and into a new life, leaving behind a legacy Indian football has hardly experienced.

The build-up to Thursday's match was all about Chhetri's send-off. Before the kick-off, the famed Blue Pilgrims stand behind the goalpost unfurled a giant tifo, showing Chhetri holding the earth, a la Hercules. India failed to turn the occasion more memorable and meaningful for Chhetri following the stalemate but that tifo perhaps represents what Chhetri has stood for in Indian football in nearly two decades since making his senior de but against Pakistan in 2005.

He will be remembered as the defining player of his generation, someone who has transcended his sport more than any other, a reference point in Indian football in the true sense of the term.

Unlike IM Vijayan, he might not have an eye for the spectacular. Unlike Bhaichung Bhutia, he might not be a typical fox in the box. Chhetri's game has always been a fable of discipline, dedication and determination.

His goals were cheeky, audacious and brilliant - scoring from midfield to embarrassing the goalkeeper with a Panenka penalty. He made people fall in love with the game.

In a later post-match felicitation, organized by the Indian Football Association, he returned to the ground to receive accolades from the Big 3 clubs - East Bengal , Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting as well as the state government. A few former players like Vijayan, Mehtab Hossain, Alvito D'Cunha and Rahim Nabi then gave him a tight embrace one by one.

KOLKATA: Goodbye Sunil Chhetri. But not a welcome yet for India to a dream place in the third round of the 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers .India failed to give their captain a perfect farewell as Igor Stimac 's team was held to a frustrating 0-0 draw against Kuwait at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. As the tearful Chhetri left the international football stage after 151 caps and 94 goals and failing to make an impact in Thursday's game, India's chances of qualifying to the next round now hang in balance.With 5 points from as many matches, and both Afghanistan (4 points from 4 games) and Kuwait (4 points from 5 games) lurking close by, the Blue Tigers now have to beat the already qualified Qatar in their own den in the final Group A fixture next Tuesday to keep hopes alive.A top-two finish in the group is the prerequisite not only for opening the door for brushing shoulders with Asia's best in the third round of World Cup qualifiers, but also guaranteeing a berth in the next edition of Asian Cup .With stakes so high, it felt like a juncture match for Igor Stimac's side. Chhetri's farewell - which drew an official attendance of 58,921 in the stands - further elevated the sense of the occasion.But India never looked in sync with the challenge in question, dishing out another frustrating performance nearly three months after losing 1-2 to Afghanistan in Guwahati and making their job more difficult now.In fact, had Gurpreet Singh Sandhu not effected a string of saves, it could have been quite embarrassing for Chhetri and his team.Stimac started with a new and bold defensive set-up, giving FC Goa left-back Jay Gupta his debut in Blue Tigers jersey and pairing up Rahul Bheke with Anwar Ali in the heart of defence in absence of injured Sandesh Jhingan.But if the Croatian coach's 4-2-3-1 formation was meant to gain early ascendancy, it failed to instil the sort of organisation and obduracy that he would have expected to characterise his backline. The result was a streak of nervy moments invading the home team's play.The match was just four minutes old when Bheke failed to intercept a pass, allowing Mohammad Abdulah to stare at the goal with a world of time and space. But Kuwait's No. 9 ended up hitting straight at Gurpreet.Relieved and reprieved, India tried to make a statement, Liston Colaco seeing his cutback cleared by Kuwait defender Hasan Alanezi for a corner and Chhetri skying an attempt way over the bar.Just when India appeared to have started to establish a more recognisable rhythm, Kuwait shook the hosts out of a false dawn, threatening to upset the applecart.",India fail to give their captain a perfect farewell as Igor Stimac's team was held to a frustrating 0-0 draw against Kuwait at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: India's 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifier against Kuwait ended in a disappointing goalless draw, failing to provide a fitting farewell for the talismanic Sunil Chhetri in his last international match.The result leaves India in a challenging position to progress to the third round of the qualifiers, with only five points collected so far. India's final match is against Asian champions Qatar on June 11, while Kuwait, with four points, will face Afghanistan on the same day.Chhetri's international career spans an impressive 19 years, during which he scored 94 goals, making him the fourth most prolific scorer in international football, behind Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (128), Iran legend Ali Daei (108) and Argentine wizard Lionel Messi (106).This remarkable achievement is particularly noteworthy for a player from a country like India, and FIFA recognised Chhetri's legendary status upon his announcement of international retirement on May 16.Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium, with a capacity of 68,000, was packed with fans, officials, and former players who came to bid an emotional adieu to Chhetri.His parents, Kharga and Sushila, and wife, Sonam Bhattacharya, were also in attendance. Although Chhetri's international career has come to an end, he will continue playing club football for Bengaluru FC in the Indian Super League for another two years, as per his current contract.Chhetri's debut match against Pakistan on June 12, 2005, in Quetta ended in a 1-1 draw, with the striker scoring in his first international appearance.However, he was unable to find the back of the net in his final match, which also ended in a draw, and had little impact on the game overall.Chhetri, the Indian captain, bid farewell to the national team after his 151st match, taking a lap of honour around the packed stadium with folded hands as the crowd chanted his name.Kuwait, who had previously suffered a 0-1 defeat to India at home, showed significant improvement in their performance. The first half was action-packed, with both teams creating chances but failing to find the back of the net.The crowd remained engaged, chanting ""Sunil, Sunil"" and ""Vande Mataram"" throughout the match.Kuwait's best chance in the first half came in the fourth minute when Eid Al-Rashidi set up Daham with a perfect through ball.

However, the desired result was not achieved, as Rahim failed to convert his chances.Kuwait's frustration peaked in the 74th minute when they were denied a penalty claim, leading to a confrontation between players and bench.Replays suggested a foul, but the referee deemed otherwise. Tempers flared up after a challenge on Indian debutant Edmund, resulting in a mini-brawl and yellow cards for both Edmund and Sultan Alenezi.Despite the tension, Edmund rallied the crowd's support with a free-kick opportunity, but Brandon Fernandes' poor delivery meant India's last hope for a win disappeared in the added seven minutes.Stimac handed left-back Gupta his international debut in a 4-2-3-1 formation, with Chhetri as the sole striker.

He carried this momentum into the third set, capitalizing on a visibly hampered Ruud, who appeared to be battling a stomach ailment. Zverev secured a crucial break in the fifth game and went on to win the set 6-4.The fourth set saw Zverev maintain his dominance, breaking Ruud's serve early and cruising to a 6-2 victory. Zverev acknowledged Ruud's resilience, stating, ""Credit to him to play until the end and fight until the end.

NEW DELHI: Carlos Alcaraz secured his place in the 2023 French Open final after a gruelling five-set victory over Jannik Sinner . This achievement marks his first final appearance at Roland Garros , a tournament holding special significance for the young Spaniard.Furthermore, his victory against Sinner secured his place in Grand Slam finals on all three surfaces – clay, grass (Wimbledon), and hard courts (US Open) – a feat achieved at a younger age than any other male player in tennis history.Alcaraz has openly expressed his admiration for the tournament and its rich history, particularly the dominance of his compatriot, Rafael Nadal .""Well, I have a special feeling to this tournament, because I remember when I finished school I'm running to my home just to put the TV on and watch the matches here in the French Open,"" said the youngster.He views the French Open as an opportunity to etch his name alongside Spanish tennis legends like Nadal, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Carlos Moya, and Albert Costa, all previous champions at Roland Garros.Beyond the allure of a maiden French Open title, Alcaraz harboured ambitions of becoming a versatile champion across all court surfaces, saying, ""Well, I always wanted to be one of the best players in the world.

Paolini started the 2024 season as the world No.29.Whatever happens in the Roland Garros final on Saturday, where the Italian takes on the queen of clay Iga Swiatek , Paolini will have a top-10 ranking come Monday.Paolini, 5 ft 4', whose play pivots off a solidity, resulting from the hard yards run over time, never made the second week of a major, until Australia in January.The world No.15, from Castelnuovo di Garfagnana, a bustling town in central Italy, has watched her share of Grand Slam finals growing up, but never quite imagined herself on Court Philippe Chatrier, playing for the title.""When I started to play tennis, I was not dreaming too much, I was just enjoying playing tennis,"" Paolini said. ""Then when I started to train to be a professional tennis player, I was dreaming to become a professional. I never dreamed to be No. 1, Grand Slam champion… Never dreamed so big.""""Step by step, I started to believe,"" the 28-year-old said. ""Step by step, I started to dream.""""For me it's surprising to see interviews from Nole (Djokovic) when he was a kid, saying that he wanted to be World No. 1, it's unbelievable to see Jannik (Sinner), when he was 15 years old, say that his dream was to be No. 1. It's unbelievable that you can dream (that big) as a child.

The 21-year-old then celebrated with a fist pump and a shout of ‘vamos’ that vibrated across the arena. The boy they call Carlitos was almost home.Alcaraz, the owner of a sparkling win-loss record in five-setters 9-1, coming into his Roland Garros semifinal, did well to push the match into the decider, which is increasingly looking like his backyard.Alcaraz -- who was creating points, pushing the pace in the fifth set, unlike the second-seeded Sinner -- powered into his first French Open final with a 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 result in 4-hours and 9-minutes.Alcaraz threw his arms in the air, letting out a victory cry after Sinner sent a ball wide on match point.Alcaraz, playing in bright yellow shorts and a dull grey tee, has now made a major final in all three surfaces – hardcourt, grass and clay.“You have to find a way to enjoy when you are suffering, (suffering) is even more on clay, in Roland Garros,” Alcaraz said. “You play long rallies, five sets, you have to fight. As I told my team many times, you have to enjoy suffering.”Alcaraz was quick to compliment Sinner following the semifinal that had championship match vibes.“The toughest matches I have played in my career are against Jannik. I hope to play many, many more matches like this against him. I learnt from last years’ match against Djokovic, in these moments, you have to keep calm, stay there fighting,” he said. “I’m really happy about everything I did today, waiting for the moment.”Sinner, 22, who will rise to No.1 in the rankings on Monday, led by a set and break in the second, and again by two-sets-to-one but like in their only meeting this year, in the semifinals of Indian Wells, the Spaniard produced champagne tennis to rally after the Italian had wrested early advantage.The start of this much-awaited semifinal – a clash of contrasts, style and personalities -- had full pendulum swings in momentum.First it was Sinner, who broke the Spaniard thrice in the opening set, then Alcaraz, who used his kick serve judiciously in the second, rallied from 0-2 down. Alcaraz won five straight games.The Italian, trying to stay in it, was broken early in the third set, dragged down by cramps which affected his hands and then hamstrings. He received treatment at the changeover. Fortunately for Sinner, his opponent’s returns were shorter than a blink, giving him space to take control of the set.There was an incident in the stands in the fourth set with the score at 4-4 (40-15). Sinner and Alcaraz offered suggestions on how they could help the elderly spectator, who needed medical attention. The break may have affected Sinner more than Alcaraz as momentum was with the Italian at that point.Whatever happens in the second semifinal between Alexander Zverev and Casper Ruud, Sunday’s final will be the first one without Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, since 2004 when Gaston Gaudio defeated Guillermo Coria.","Carlos Alcaraz beats Jannik Sinner in five sets to reach French Open final.

However, the Italian, who hadn't played for nearly a month before the French Open due to a hip injury, suddenly lost his momentum. This allowed Alcaraz to capitalize, using his forehand to devastating effect and leveling the match.The Spaniard broke for 2-1 in the third set with a gravity-defying crosscourt passing shot as Sinner's freefall continued. Despite apparent hand cramps, the future world number one clawed his way back, saving break points in the fifth game to stay in the contest.Sinner then broke twice more to take the set - a scenario that seemed highly unlikely when he could barely hold his racket just minutes earlier.The match lived up to its billing in the fourth set, with both players trading impressive blows. Leading 5-4, Alcaraz rallied from 30-0 down on Sinner's serve, winning four points in a row and forcing a decider with a crosscourt backhand winner at the end of a spectacular point.Alcaraz snatched an early break by wrongfooting Sinner in the second game and never looked back, despite some nerves on the first two match points.",Carlos Alcaraz beats Jannik Sinner in five sets to reach French Open final.

Currently ranked 95th in the world, Nagal aims to maximize his ranking points to enhance his chances of qualifying for the 64-player men's singles draw at the Paris Olympics.

Despite his disappointing straight-set first-round exit from the French Open against Karen Khachanov , the Indian ace has shown strong form this week, advancing to the semifinals at the Euro 120,000 tour event.

In the match lasting 1 hour and 22 minutes, Nagal's impressive first and second serve percentages of 83% and 70%, respectively, proved pivotal against Gakhov's 51% and 57%.

Nagal capitalized on four break points while also saving two out of three crucial moments when facing potential breaks.

""From end of last year and till this year probably, I have been playing my best tennis. Before that I was out for 16-18 months due to a hip surgery and end of 2022, I could play freely and without any pain,"" Nagal said after the match.

NEW DELHI: Iga Swiatek 's dominance at the French Open has been unparalleled in recent years, with the Polish star aiming for her fourth title in five years as she faces Jasmine Paolini in Saturday's final.Swiatek's path to the final has been nearly flawless, with only a close call against Naomi Osaka in the second round, where she saved a match point to advance.The top seed's all-court game has been too much for her opponents to handle, and 12th seed Paolini will need to produce an exceptional performance to prevent Swiatek from claiming her third consecutive French Open trophy.Swiatek's current streak at Roland Garros stands at an impressive 20 matches, dating back to her maiden Grand Slam victory in Paris four years ago.Having already secured titles in Madrid and Rome this season, Swiatek is on the verge of extending her winning streak on clay to 19 matches.Her remarkable consistency and prowess on the surface have led fans and analysts to draw comparisons with Rafael Nadal , the 14-time French Open champion, suggesting that Swiatek is well on her way to becoming a claycourt legend in her own right.""We'll see in 14 years if the journey is similar,"" four-times Grand Slam champion Swiatek told reporters after thumping third seed Coco Gauff in the semi-finals on Thursday.""That's obviously really nice. I'd never expect anybody to compare me to Rafa because for me he's above everybody, and he's a total legend.""We'll see... but I'm proud of myself that I'm playing consistently here and that I'm mentioned in the same sentence as Rafa. That's cool.""Swiatek's victory in the semi-final secured her a remarkable achievement, joining a select group of players who have reached three consecutive French Open finals since the turn of the millennium. This exclusive club includes Justine Henin (2005-07) and Maria Sharapova (2012-14).Despite her young age of 23, Swiatek has already established herself as one of the most promising talents in the Open era. She stands as the second-youngest player to reach four championship matches, surpassed only by the legendary Steffi Graf, who accomplished this feat in 1990.""After the tournament it usually hits me what I achieved, but during it, I feel like I just need to play another match,"" said Swiatek.""Sometimes, it's hard not to see what's at stake and what the atmosphere is around these matches. I'm not used to it. It's not the routine. On the other hand, when I'm focused on work, I can make it a routine because that's easier to do.""Facing the tall task of toppling Swiatek at her favourite hunting ground is Paolini, the diminutive Italian with Polish roots who is in the midst of her most impressive season and eyeing a maiden Grand Slam trophy.The tenacious 28-year-old has enjoyed a favourable draw in Paris but showed she could pack a punch when needed by stunning fourth seed Elena Rybakina in the quarter-finals before beating 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva in the semi-finals.""Iga is an unbelievable player. So young, but so many achievements and Grand Slams,"" Dubai champion Paolini said.""She's doing well week by week and that's not easy. So I have huge respect for her but my goal is to step onto the court on Saturday and try to enjoy the match, enjoy that moment and try to play a good match.""With Jannik Sinner assured of the men's top ranking next week, Paolini will look to add the icing on the cake in what has already been a hugely successful tournament for Italy.",Iga Swiatek will play Jasmine Paolini in the French Open final on Saturday.

Crispy clean. The 23-year-old world No.1 had just 14 unforced errors in the Roland Garros semifinal against American Coco Gauff .Swiatek, who has won 20 straight matches at the French Open, came through 6-2, 6-4 in an hour and 37-minutes to make her fourth final here in five years.The match was going to plan for Swiatek, while Gauff, cheered on by the Philippe Chatrier crowd, couldn’t get her aggressive gameplan on the map.The athletic 20-year-old, who had lost ten of their 11 meetings coming into the semifinal, appeared to make some inroads in the second set.In the fourth game of the set, with Swiatek serving, a call on the serve was overruled by the umpire.Gauff argued that she had hit the ball after the call was made, but the umpire disagreed. Gauff, who was reduced to tears by the incident, lost the point, but won the game. She, however, couldn’t quite get going thereafter.The American justifiably reopened the debate of an appeal system that left no room for human error.“I think tennis is the only sport where not only we don't have the VR system, but a lot of times the decisions are made by one person,” said Gauff, who’ll move to No.2 in the rankings on Monday. “In other sports there's usually multiple refs in making a decision. I know the US Open brought some of it last year. I know we used it in our doubles at one point.”“It's almost ridiculous that we don't have it (in tennis).
