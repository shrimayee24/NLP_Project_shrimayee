BJP Leader Attacks Shah Rukh Khan Over KKR's Bangladeshi Cricketer Amid Hindu Lynching in Bangladesh

.

NEW DELHI: Hindu religious leaders and BJP figures have launched sharp attacks on Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan over his IPL team Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) selecting Bangladeshi cricketer Mustafizur Rahman , while the Congress has stepped in to defend the actor, calling the remarks against him an attack on India’s pluralism.The first public criticism came from Hindu spiritual leader Devkinandan Thakur, who questioned KKR’s decision in the backdrop of reported violence against Hindu minorities in Bangladesh. Speaking to ANI, Thakur said the KKR management should remove the Bangladeshi player. He demanded that the money paid to the cricketer be given to families of Hindu victims as an apology.""The management of KKR, their boss, should remove that cricketer (Mustafizur Rahman). Rs 9.2 crore that they are giving to that cricketer, that money should be given as an apology to the relatives of the Hindu children if they are in India, so that at least they can know that their feelings are with the Hindus,"" Thakur said.Spiritual leader Jagadguru Swami Rambhadracharya went on to questioned Khan’s character and called hhim a traitor.""He (Shah Rukh Khan) is not a hero. Shah Rukh Khan does not have a character.His actions have been those of a traitor,"" Rambhadracharya said.Soon after, BJP leader Sangeet Som called Shah Rukh Khan a “traitor” and accused him of investing money in a player from a country he claimed was “working against India”. Som said Mustafizur Rahman would not be allowed to play in the IPL.""The way Hindus are being persecuted in Bangladesh, women and girls are being raped, their homes are being burned, and anti-India slogans are being chanted there. Despite all this, traitors like Shah Rukh Khan, I'm calling him a traitor because everything he has is given by India, given by the people of India, but where do they invest this money? They invest it in players from a country that is working against India. I want to tell people like Shah Rukh Khan that they will not succeed. At any cost, they will not be able to get Mustafizur Rahman to play here. Rahman won't be able to step outside the airport,"" Som told ANI.The response from Congress followed soon after. MP Manickam Tagore condemned the remarks against Khan, calling them an attack on India’s pluralism. In a post on X, Tagore said hatred could not define nationalism and criticised the RSS for spreading division.""Calling Superstar Shah Rukh Khan a 'traitor' is an attack on India's pluralism. Hate cannot define nationalism. RSS must stop poisoning society.""The attacks come amid a series of violent incidents targeting members of the Hindu community in Bangladesh. Last month, two Hindu youths were lynched in separate incidents. Dipu Chandra Das, a garment factory worker in Mymensingh district, was beaten to death over alleged blasphemy charges on December 18, after which his body was reportedly hanged and set on fire.",Hindu religious leaders and BJP figures have launched sharp attacks on Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan over his IPL team Kolkata Knight Riders.

Jaden Ivey’s return brings cautious optimism for the Detroit Pistons after long injury layoff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/jaden-iveys-return-brings-cautious-optimism-for-the-detroit-pistons-after-long-injury-layoff/articleshow/126296299.cms,"Jaden Ivey is a phenomenal player (Image via NBA)

Jaden Ivey flashes pre-injury form while easing back into Detroit’s rotation

Pistons prioritize patience as Jaden Ivey’s explosive spark returns off the bench





Jaden Ivey's journey back to full health has been gradual and challenging. For the Detroit Pistons, the return of shooting guard Jaden Ivey has presented an interesting scenario. After sustaining a fibula injury in January, the former first-round draft pick made his season debut in November. During a loose-ball scuffle, former Orlando Magic guard Cole Anthony lunged into Ivey's leg, ending his 2024–25 season at 30 games.The 23-year-old broke his left fibula at the end of the 2024–25 NBA season, which ended his season and caused knee pain over a year later. After undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his right knee in October of last year, he was able to return to the court in late November.Ivey was arguably playing the best basketball of his career before the accident. In his third season, he averaged a career-high 17.6 points per game and a remarkable 40.9% 3-point shooting percentage. His style seemed to match in well with All-Star Cade Cunningham, and his development was helping Detroit win basketball.Prior to the Pistons' victory over the Sacramento Kings, Bickerstaff directly addressed the strategy for Ivey.""A plan in place for him to ramp up where he's comfortable, where he's confident, so that he can get back to playing the bulk minutes,"" he stated. Bickerstaff did not specify the plan's parameters or provide a deadline.Ivey is now coming off the bench for the Pistons after being activated for 17 games. He was only allowed to play for 15 minutes until he recovered enough to play on the court. Although his conditioning and game have improved, the return is still a work in progress.Thankfully, it appears that he is back on the court at last, albeit not entirely in the same manner that made him such a valuable contributor. In 17 games, he has averaged 8.4 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 1.8 assists per night while shooting 45.5% from the field and 39.6% from beyond the arc.Although his output isn't as high as it was during his three stints as a starter, he is still contributing to the Pistons' victories. The Pistons have only dropped six games since his return.It doesn't make much sense, at least not in the near future, even though Ivey would like to start again this season. The coaching staff does not want him to become exhausted and worsen his injury.Since returning to the squad this season, Ivey has averaged eight points per game. It's obvious that he's still trying to go back to his best and give the Pistons his all. It appears that head coach J.B. Bickerstaff is attempting to raise Ivey's workload following a cautious, slow start.Many other clubs in the league wish they could have the spark he brings off the bench. Before he returned to the court, Detroit was lacking in both speed and high-efficiency shooting. Head coach J.B. Bickerstaff said:“He looks good. You almost forget how fast and explosive he is.. His ability to explode from a stop to a start and get to full speed on his first step is remarkable.”Ivey's influence will be inconsistent due to his limited playing time, especially on nights when he plays for less than 20 minutes.Also read: Is Malik Beasley joining New York Knicks?

Perez Hilton reacts to Nicki Minaj deportation petition backlash

Drama At Amfest: Erika In Shock As Nicki Minaj Calls JD Vance 'ASSASSIN' | WATCH





“People are PISSED” became the blunt takeaway from a rapidly escalating backlash that has pulled Nicki Minaj into a fresh culture war moment. A resurfaced Change.org petition calling for her deportation to Trinidad has reignited debate around celebrity politics, fan loyalty, and the consequences of public alignment. What began months ago quietly gained sudden momentum after Minaj’s appearance at Turning Point USA’s AmFest, pushing the controversy back into the spotlight.The renewed attention has less to do with immigration law and more to do with fractured trust. Longtime fans, particularly from the LGBTQ+ community, have voiced anger and disappointment, arguing that Minaj’s recent political rhetoric feels like a sharp break from the values they once believed she championed. Into this charged space stepped Perez Hilton, whose reaction added fuel to an already emotional discussion.In a recent blog post Perez Hilton tackled the viral petition by positioning it as an expression of extreme desperation, and not an actual legal request. He underlined the fact that Minaj is a legal citizen of the United States of America, but not a citizen, and underlined the symbolic nature of the petition to disappointed fans.Reflecting on her political turn, Hilton wrote that Minaj had openly aligned herself with conservative figures, describing it as cementing her “marriage with MAGA.”His strongest reaction centered on the sense of betrayal felt by parts of her fanbase. Referring directly to the petition and its growing traction, Hilton wrote,""Seriously SO disappointing! Nicki built her career off a massive base of LGBT fans! So turn on them in such a bold way? A major stinger! People are PISSED… and are now, ironically, even looking to the President’s merciless crackdown on immigration as a possible way to boot her out of the country!""The petition itself accuses Minaj of erratic behavior, harassment of the Carters, and continued support of her husband Kenneth Petty, a registered sex offender. It also highlights remarks she made at AmFest, including, “Boys should just be boys,” which critics say undermines LGBTQ+ communities that once viewed her as an ally.Although there is no legal action that seems to be occurring soon, the episode highlights a greater reality. The impact of celebrities has permanent effects in the current age and the personalities in society have been evaluated not just by their art, but also by the associations they would like to be associated with.Also Read: “Jeez.

Perez Hilton reacted strongly, saying fans are furious over her political shift and comments that critics view as anti-LGBTQ+. While Minaj remains a legal U.S. resident, the petition reflects growing backlash and fractured support.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126296168,imgsize-71280,width-400,resizemode-4/126296168.jpg"

49ers vs Seahawks playoff picture intensifies rivalry spotlight







49ers vs Seahawks playoff picture sits at the center of the NFL’s most volatile weekend, and it defines the tension pouring into the season’s final chapter. With the margins thin and emotions loud, this rivalry arrives carrying more than records. It carries memory, noise, and consequence. Saturday night is not about comfort. It is about control, momentum, and who gets to shape January before it even begins.Pressure does not always come from the scoreboard. Sometimes it rises from the stands, the echoes of past battles, and the weight of what is at stake. As the regular season closes, San Francisco and Seattle meet with division pride and playoff positioning hanging in the balance. This is the kind of game that strips teams down to habits and nerve, where stars speak plainly because the stakes leave no room for polish.George Kittle did not soften his words when asked about Seattle’s fan culture. He embraced it. His comments reflected admiration wrapped in rivalry, the kind that fuels players rather than distracts them.“Seattle is one of my favorite stadiums because they hate us and it’s always twice as loud as any other stadium I ever play in,” Kittle said to the press Thursday afternoon.“It’s just a great atmosphere, and I love their hatred for us, and hopefully the Faithful will bring it this weekend for them.”Those words land differently because the setting has changed. The regular season finale shifts to Levi’s Stadium, but the noise will not feel local. Seattle fans travel well, and they know this game could decide the NFC West. The Seahawks arrive with a 13-3 record and a narrow lead that keeps the door closed, for now. San Francisco understands that one slip erases months of work.Their first meeting feels distant. Week 1 delivered a tight San Francisco win in Seattle, a defensive grind that hinted at how thin the margins would remain. Sixteen weeks later, everything is sharper. One game separates the 49ers from a division crown that would add another chapter to their legacy.This contest demands more than execution. It demands ownership of the moment. The 49ers must protect their home field from both a rival roster and a rival crowd. If they fail, the playoff picture shifts instantly, and control slips away just as quickly.Also Read: Micah Parsons’ first reaction to Trevon Diggs joining Packers keeps Cowboys reunion hopes alive for 2026","49ers vs Seahawks playoff picture intensifies rivalry spotlight.

Old locker room video involving Stefon Diggs gains attention amid ongoing case





An old clip has returned to the spotlight at the worst possible moment for Stefon Diggs . As serious legal allegations dominate the conversation around the New England Patriots wide receiver, a lighthearted team video from his Minnesota Vikings days has resurfaced online, taking on an entirely different tone. What once played as locker room banter now feels uncomfortable for many watching it again through a 2025 lens.The video’s reappearance has less to do with humor and more to do with timing. With Diggs facing criminal charges, social media has begun reexamining past moments, looking for patterns and clues. Fair or not, the resurfaced footage has become part of a broader public reckoning around the star receiver, even though it predates his current situation by years.The clip comes from the Vikings’ “96 Questions” series, filmed during Diggs’ tenure in Minnesota. Players were asked which teammate they would least want to date their sister. Dalvin Cook, Laquon Treadwell, and Adam Thielen all named Diggs, each answering with little hesitation.“He’s just crazy,” Treadwell bluntly explained. “He’s just outrageous. Don’t know what he’s going to say. He just don’t know what to expect every day, so he couldn’t date my sister.”Thielen followed with a similar assessment. “He’s just not a guy that you want to bring home to your parents,” claimed Thielen. “Like, you don’t want your sister to bring him home to your parents, so therefore she can’t date him.”Diggs, when asked the same question, laughed and fired back, naming linebacker Stephen Weatherly “because he is ugly,” before bursting into laughter.At the time, the exchange fit the tone of a casual team segment meant to entertain fans. Today, it circulates in a far more serious context.Diggs is scheduled for an arraignment on Jan. 23 after being charged with felony strangulation and misdemeanor assault related to an alleged Dec. 2 incident. According to the accusation, a woman claims the four time Pro Bowler struck her and attempted to choke her.The resurfaced video carries no legal weight. Still, its renewed attention shows how quickly public perception can shift when allegations surface. For Diggs, the clip is a footnote compared to what lies ahead. The legal process, not old jokes, will ultimately define the next chapter of his career.Also Read: Stefon Diggs shares intimate moment with Cardi B as breakout season continues amid ongoing assault charge","Old locker room video involving Stefon Diggs gains attention amid ongoing case.

Joseph Parker's boxing career, salary, and investments

Andy Lee’s investments, career, and net worth of the boxer-coach duo





Joseph Parker and Andy Lee represent a boxing victory that still attracts fans. Wise investments and brand deals are also factors of their financial trajectory apart from boxing careers. The former WBO heavyweight champion, Parker, still brings in millions from fights and endorsements while the retired WBO middleweight champion, Lee, maintains his fortune through coaching, commentary, and making good financial choices.Joseph Parker has made a property investment and lives a nice lifestyle in New Zealand, where he manages family life and boxing training at the same time. Lee’s living comparatively and modestly is still an ongoing process that comes from Parker’s competition with him, and that is the reason he can still mentor others.Parker’s comeback victories over Deontay Wilder and Zhilei Zhang have also increased his fight purses. The reports say that he gets $1.5 million for each fight. Parker's financial status is probably to be significantly enhanced, though, as Wardley and Dubois are going to create difficult fights, earning him more money apart from his fight purses.Apart from this, he gets a cut from the pay-per-view revenues besides his fight purses and has endorsement contracts that steadily reinforce his position as one of the richest heavyweight boxers in this era.His sponsorships and public appearances are also contributing to his financial security. It is very easy to approach him, and he also keeps it simple. Parker is sometimes overtly issues his Samoan background and connections to the community.Lee’s career highlights are winning the WBO title in 2014 against Matt Korobov plus a record of 35 wins, 24 by knockout. After retiring, he began to coach and do television commentary, training boxers like Tyson Fury and participating in the boxing world, which still earns him money. Lee focuses on the coaching and commentary side of the sport, thus making sure that the income after retirement is not so unstable.Parker and Lee together will have a combined net worth of $25-$37 million in 2025, which proves that their relevance in the boxing world as well as in other fields has been continuous and strong.Also Read: Joseph parker net worth in 2025: Boxing career, earnings, endorsements, lifestyle and more","Former WBO heavyweight champion, Parker, still brings in millions from fights and endorsements.

5. Fred VanVleet injury troubles







With the NBA’s expansion, every game demands more from players on the hardwood. From fancier dunks to “swish” threes, the league’s requirement from its stars is at an all-time high. The sport of basketball is one of the world’s fastest in the world, and along with its breakneck speed, it is physically taxing on the players. The constant matches with no time to rest and reenergize have increased the risks of injuries.With 2025 ending, a lot of injuries were reported that reshaped the championship landscape in the NBA.From heartbreaking Achilles tears in the Finals to the ongoing maintenance of the league's most dominant big men, health has become the ultimate X-factor for the 2025-26 season.After leading the Indiana Pacers to a historic Game 7 in the NBA Finals, Tyrese Haliburton suffered a torn Achilles tendon in the summer of 2025 that has sidelined him for this entire season. With their star player injured, the Indiana Pacers were forced into a development and survival mode, leaning heavily on Bennedict Mathurin while their title window stays frustratingly closed for a year.Nuggets announced on 30th December 2025, that the MVP contender is out for at least four weeks after suffering a left knee hyperextension in a matchup against Miami.For the Denver Nuggets, Jokić isn't just a player, he is their core system, and his absence puts immense pressure on Jamal Murray and Aaron Gordon on the offensive side. With the Western Conference filled with heavyweights, this 4-week stretch turns the tables for the worse.The dunking star suffered an ankle sprain back in October and then another ankle sprain in December. These repetitive injuries could potentially become a stumbling block for the Grizzlies during the playoffs. Memphis remains a contender only when Morant is on the floor, and this constant uncertainty gives a shaky foundation for their championship dream.The Dallas Mavericks have spent most of 2025 trying to fill in the gap left by their superstar point guard, Kyrie Irving, who sustained a torn left ACL in early March against the Kings. Irving’s injury abruptly ended his 2024-25 campaign and forced the Mavericks into a difficult spot. Despite the arrival of Anthony Davis and the rookie sensation Cooper Flagg, the team has struggled in clutch situations without Irving’s elite shot-making.With Kevin Durant's addition to the team, Rockets are currently Houston to a top-four standing. But without their key two-way player, Fred VanVleet, who suffered an ACL injury in September, the Rockets are missing their vital component. VanVleet’s influence on the team’s culture is commendable, and his loss was a significant hit to the team. The 2019 NBA champion’s absence forces young stars like Amen Thompson into high-pressure roles.Also read: Is Nikola Jokic’s NBA MVP bid slipping away as knee injury lingers for Denver Nuggets star?","With the NBA's expansion, every game demands more from players on the hardwood.

What the misdemeanor domestic assault charge against Christian Barmore means legally

Patriots acknowledge situation as NFL monitors case





Christian Barmore, one of the New England Patriots’ key defensive linemen, is facing a new off-field legal issue. Court records show the Patriots defensive tackle has been charged with a misdemeanor domestic assault and battery, a development that surfaced through Massachusetts court documents this week. The charge places Barmore under legal scrutiny at a time when NFL teams are closely watched for how they respond to off-field matters involving players. While the case is still in its early stages, it has already drawn attention from the Patriots organization and the league.According to court records, Barmore is facing a single count of domestic assault and battery, which is classified as a misdemeanor under Massachusetts law. He is scheduled to be arraigned in district court, a procedural step where the charge will be formally read and he will have the opportunity to enter a plea.At this stage, it is important to note that Barmore has been charged, not convicted. An arraignment does not determine guilt and is simply the beginning of the legal process. Any potential consequences, either legally or from the NFL, would come later and depend on how the case proceeds.Court documents state that the charge stems from an alleged incident that occurred in August at a residence in Massachusetts. The alleged victim is described in the police complaint as a woman with whom Barmore shares a child.According to the complaint, an argument between the two escalated, and the woman later told police that Barmore allegedly grabbed her phone, threw her to the ground, and grabbed her clothing near the neck area before letting her go. The incident was reportedly witnessed by their child. The woman later provided photos to authorities that she said showed bruising.All details referenced in this section are based solely on court documents and police reports. Barmore has not been convicted, and the allegations have not been tested in court.The New England Patriots have acknowledged awareness of the situation. The team said it informed the NFL and is monitoring the matter while allowing the legal process to play out. No immediate disciplinary action has been announced by the team or the league.Under the NFL’s personal conduct policy, the league can choose to review a case independently of the court system. Any potential league discipline would typically come after more information becomes available through legal proceedings.Barmore has been a significant piece of the Patriots’ defensive front, and any uncertainty surrounding his availability naturally draws attention. Even without immediate roster consequences, situations like this create added scrutiny for both the player and the organization.For now, the Patriots appear to be taking a wait-and-see approach, as is common in cases that are still in the early legal stages.Also read - Nikki Bella and Cooper DeJean dating rumors: how it all started and where things stand",New England Patriots defensive tackle Christian Barmore charged with misdemeanor domestic assault and battery.

There is something incredibly about documentaries as they brilliantly capture the raw emotions and do justice to the intensity behind them. Basketball as a sport is just not about rings and championships, it is about every single drop of sweat that made a player’s dream of becoming a champion real.

Travis Kelce’s Chiefs career defined by wins, not personal milestones







If Sunday ends up being the final game of Travis Kelce ’s career, it will close a chapter that is hard to match in NFL history. Kelce would walk away with some of the most impressive postseason numbers the league has ever seen, especially when it comes to winning when it matters most.Kelce owns 178 playoff receptions, which is 27 more than Jerry Rice, and his 35 Super Bowl catches rank first all time. Still, records have never been the thing that motivated him. Throughout his career, Kelce has made it clear that team success always came before personal milestones.That mindset showed up clearly two seasons ago. Kelce entered the final regular-season game needing just 16 receiving yards to reach his eighth straight 1,000-yard season. Only six players in NFL history have managed that kind of streak. But with the Kansas City Chiefs already locked into the playoffs, Kelce sat out to rest. The record did not happen, but Kansas City went on to win its third Super Bowl in five years.There is one achievement Kelce will finish this season with no matter what happens Sunday against the Las Vegas Raiders. He is now the winningest player in Chiefs history. His career record stands at 136 wins and 55 losses.Kelce’s journey with the Chiefs began in 2013, when he played just one special teams snap in a win. Over time, he became one of the most important players the franchise has ever had. He now sits ahead of Hall of Fame guard Will Shields, who finished his Chiefs career at 131-93. Long snapper James Winchester follows with 129 wins, while former punter Dustin Colquitt recorded 125.Several things helped shape this era. The NFL moved to a 17-game schedule in 2021, but the bigger reason is the consistent success Kansas City has had since head coach Andy Reid and Kelce arrived in 2013. Kelce’s 11 Pro Bowl seasons line up closely with the team’s most dominant stretch.The playoff numbers tell the same story. In postseason games where Kelce and Winchester played, the Chiefs went 18-7. Only four players in NFL history have appeared in more playoff wins: Tom Brady, Adam Vinatieri, Stephen Gostkowski, and Bill Romanowski.Sunday’s game also brings other storylines. Cornerback Nohl Williams has taken on a bigger role late in the season. Raiders rookie running back Ashton Jeanty is chasing a franchise record. And on special teams, punter Matt Araiza has had a strong year.Also read: Travis Kelce won't be back with the Kansas City Chiefs?

Cam Newton makes a bold MVP case for Myles Garrett as quarterback favorites dominate the conversation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/cam-newton-makes-a-bold-mvp-case-for-myles-garrett-as-quarterback-favorites-dominate-the-conversation/articleshow/126287979.cms,"Cam Newton (via Getty Images)

Why Cam Newton believes defensive dominance still defines true value

MYLES GARRETT FOR NFL MVP?! 😯 Cam Newton SPARKS DEBATE by making the case 🗣️ | First Take





The NFL MVP conversation is reaching its loudest point as the final week of the regular season approaches. Most years, the award felt decided before ballots are cast, with certain quarterbacks dominating both the discussion and the voting. This season has followed a similar path, with Matthew Stafford and Drake Maye taking turns as the favorite.Their performances, wins, and highlight moments have fueled the buzz among fans and voters. Still, former league MVP Cam Newton believes the race is being framed too narrowly. In his view, a player’s value is not only about touchdowns or team records but about how one player can bend an entire game plan without ever touching the ball. Newton is putting his bets on Myles Garrett for the prestige title.Appearing on First Take, Newton made it clear that Myles Garrett’s impact goes far beyond the box score. He said, “You don't see people game-planning Drake Maye, respectfully, not even Matthew Stafford as much as they game-plan against Myles Garrett…If we're talking about most valuable player, (Garrett) has shown that he is the most valuable player.”Garrett’s numbers back up Newton’s solid argument. The Browns star has piled up 22 sacks and sits just half a sack away from tying the single-season record shared by Michael Strahan and T.J. Watt. At age 30, and on a massive $160 million contract, Garrett is delivering elite production while anchoring a defense that keeps Cleveland competitive every week.Newton also drew a historical parallel to reinforce his case, saying, “Who does Myles Garrett remind us of? (New York Giants legend) Lawrence Taylor. Taylor won the MVP in 1986 with 20.5 sacks.” Still, the reality of modern MVP voting favors quarterbacks. Stafford briefly held the inside track, but Drake Maye’s five-touchdown performance against the Jets shifted momentum.The Patriots sit at 13-3, have secured the AFC East, and Maye now leads betting odds at minus 400, giving him an estimated 80 percent chance to win the award. Even if Garrett falls short in MVP voting, his season remains historic.Also read: Cam Newton says he gets “no Brady deal” while discussing racial pay gaps in NFL media","The NFL MVP conversation is reaching its loudest point as the final week of the regular season approaches.

Having passed her due date, she's now preparing for a VBAC after a scheduled C-section was canceled, finding strength in the support of other 49ers partners and spouses.

Sydney Warner shares pregnancy struggles and asks for prayers





As she waits to welcome her second child, Fred Warner’s wife Sydney Warner has been sharing emotional updates about how different this pregnancy has been. While she has been through childbirth before, this time has come with unexpected changes, long days of waiting, and a lot of uncertainty.Sydney took to Instagram this week to explain what she is going through as she waits for labor to begin. With her due date long behind her, she admitted the experience has been frustrating and exhausting. Trying to stay positive, she asked her followers for prayers while opening up about how hard the waiting has been.https://www.instagram.com/p/DStmX4UjA0r/?hl=en&img_index=1In one of her stories, Sydney summed up her feelings with humor and honesty. “These babies never wanna come out of me normal,” she said. “They just wanna stay inside. And I don’t know why, but I’m gonna be 43 weeks pregnant. You guys send prayers. I’m trying to be like I laugh and then I cry at night.”She explained that her plans have changed since her last pregnancy. Sydney had to cancel a scheduled C-section and is now planning to attempt a VBAC, or vaginal birth after cesarean. Unlike her first pregnancy, which ended with surgery, this time her baby girl is positioned head-down and low.Doctors see that as a good sign, but it has still brought new fears.Despite the nerves, Sydney made it clear she is committed to waiting it out. “But I’m determined to wait this out and let her come whenever she’s ready naturally,” she added. “I’m following her lead.”After a recent doctor’s appointment, Sydney shared that she went through her first-ever cervical check. It was a new experience for her and a reminder of how different this pregnancy feels. The first time, everything was planned. She showed up for surgery and met her baby. This time, she is dealing with daily discomfort, emotional ups and downs, and constant waiting.She ended her update by wishing everyone a Happy New Year and again asking for prayers that labor would begin soon.Fred and Sydney were married in June 2022 and welcomed their first child, Beau Anthony, in March 2024. They announced in September that they were expecting their second baby.One thing helping Sydney through this period is the support she has found among the San Francisco 49ers partners and spouses. She has spoken about how meaningful that community has been for her. “It’s just so nice having like a, a tribe of women with children, some without, some that are girlfriends, fiancés, wives,” she said. “This is such a niche job for your husband or coach or anyone on the staff, so it’s a very particular situation to be in. And being able to have community is just of women is just like the best.”Looking back, Sydney admitted she was shy at first but now encourages others to connect. “Being confident and making these connections because you are gonna possibly be around these women for the next eight to 10 years,” she said. “Take advantage of it.”Also read: Marshawn Kneeland’s girlfriend shares emotional pregnancy update weeks after his death, shares a message for their unborn baby","Fred Warner's wife, Sydney, is sharing emotional updates about her second pregnancy.

A season of lessons shapes the decision

Steve Sarkisian on Arch Manning

NIL value holds firm amid NFL delay

Also Read:





Arch Manning has made a defining call early in his college career, opting to pass on the 2026 NFL Draft and return to the Texas Longhorns for another season in Austin. The decision signals a long-term bet on development over draft-day hype for one of college football’s most scrutinised young quarterbacks.Manning entered the 2025 season surrounded by enormous expectations. Many projected him as a future No. 1 overall pick, while Texas was tipped as a national title contender. Reality proved more complex. Early inconsistencies and pressure behind a leaky offensive line stalled momentum, and his draft stock cooled as the season progressed.Still, the redshirt sophomore closed the year strongly, showing poise, sharper footwork and improved decision-making down the stretch.“I felt like I developed a lot this year, especially towards the back half, and I want to keep it going,” Manning said. “There is no reason to leave. I’ve got a lot more football left to play.”Head coach Steve Sarkisian has publicly backed the move, calling it a mature step that could pay dividends long-term. Sarkisian believes Manning’s development has gone beyond the stat sheet, pointing to improved command at the line of scrimmage and greater comfort handling in-game adversity.From a numbers perspective, Manning’s season was solid if not spectacular. He threw for nearly 3,000 yards, accounted for over 30 total touchdowns, and led Texas to a double-digit win campaign capped by a bowl victory. However, seven interceptions and early-season struggles highlighted why another collegiate year could be valuable before taking on the NFL spotlight.The decision also carries financial and branding implications. Manning remains one of college football’s most valuable NIL athletes, even after his valuation dipped slightly during the season. With endorsement deals spanning national brands and his surname still carrying weight, another year in college does little to hurt his earning power and may enhance it if his on-field play takes a leap.From an NFL perspective, scouts remain intrigued. Several evaluators have noted that Manning still possesses franchise-quarterback traits size, arm strength, and composure even if refinement is needed. Early projections already place him firmly in the conversation for the 2027 NFL Draft, provided his upward trajectory continues.For now, Arch Manning’s message is clear. This is not a retreat from the NFL dream, but a recalibration. By betting on another year in burnt orange, he is betting on growth, patience, and the belief that the best version of his game is still to come.",Arch Manning will return to the Texas Longhorns for another season. The decision signals a long-term bet on development over draft-day hype. Head coach Steve Sarkisian believes Manning’s development has gone beyond the stat sheet.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126289164,imgsize-925051,width-400,resizemode-4/arch-manning.jpg"

Bruce Arians says stay the course, even after a third straight playoff miss

Carlie Irsay-Gordon has not discussed job security yet, but history is working against Steichen





The Indianapolis Colts are officially out of the playoffs, and the fallout has already begun. After starting the season 8-2, Indianapolis became the first team since 1995 to miss the postseason following such a start. That collapse has put head coach Shane Steichen under real pressure as the franchise enters its first offseason under principal owner Carlie Irsay-Gordon.Steichen has now missed the playoffs in three straight seasons. Injuries explain part of the story, but not all of it. With the Colts eliminated and no job-security talks happening yet, Irsay-Gordon is facing her first defining football decision. Keep the coach and trust the process, or decide that close is no longer good enough.Former Colts offensive coordinator and interim head coach Bruce Arians does not believe Indianapolis should make a coaching change. Appearing on the Dec. 31 episode of “The Pat McAfee Show,” Arians urged patience from ownership.“I hope the Colts don’t make a change, because I think they’re close…be patient, you’re very, very close. Don’t let one or two injuries run you out of the whole damn thing,” Arians said.The argument starts with how the season opened. Indianapolis entered its bye week at 8-2 and looked like a legitimate AFC contender.ESPN’s Football Power Index once gave the Colts a 93.9% chance to make the playoffs and a 79.4% chance to win the AFC South. At that point, the franchise acted like a team chasing a Super Bowl, trading two first-round picks and a second-round receiver to acquire Sauce Gardner from the New York Jets.Then everything unraveled. Quarterback Daniel Jones suffered a ruptured Achilles in Week 14 against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Anthony Richardson Sr. was already on injured reserve with an eye injury. The Colts turned to a retired Philip Rivers, who lost all three of his starts. DeForest Buckner reinjured his neck. Gardner went down with a calf injury. Charvarius Ward suffered another concussion that ended his season.The Colts lost six straight games. Their season ended without a playoff berth for the fifth consecutive year.Steichen acknowledged the pattern after a Week 17 loss to the San Francisco 49ers.“It’s something I’ve got to look at,” he said. “We’ve got to find ways to win, especially in November and December. That’s where you win games and that’s where you make the playoffs.”Steichen confirmed in Week 18 that he has not spoken with Irsay-Gordon about his future.“I have not had those conversations with Carlie,” Steichen said. “But I do meet with Carlie every week. We do a game debrief, go through the process of every game.”That working relationship is close. Irsay-Gordon is regularly present at practices, position meetings, and game debriefs. She meets weekly with Steichen and general manager Chris Ballard and was directly involved in major decisions, including the Gardner trade. She has also made it clear in the past that injuries matter when evaluating a season.“Do you have a crystal ball?” Irsay-Gordon said earlier this year. “Of course, things happen and some of it is we all have to look at all these factors.”Still, the results are hard to ignore. Steichen is now 25-25 across three seasons. Indianapolis has entered must-win games late in each of those seasons and failed every time. The Colts also hold a piece of unwanted history as the first team in 30 years to start 8-2 and miss the playoffs.This offseason is different. It is Irsay-Gordon’s first as principal owner following the death of her father, Jim Irsay, in May. Along with her sisters, she must decide whether to stay patient with a coach who has shown offensive upside but no postseason results, and a general manager who has one playoff win in nine seasons.The Colts are expected to consider re-signing Jones despite his injury. That plan, according to team sources, signals continuity. But continuity only works if the late-season failures stop.","The Indianapolis Colts are officially out of the playoffs, and the fallout has already begun.

A familiar matchup with high stakes

Also Read:





As the NFL heads into a decisive Week 18, one individual milestone has quietly taken center stage alongside playoff scenarios. Cleveland Browns pass rusher Myles Garrett stands on the brink of history, just one sack away from breaking the NFL’s single-season sack record. Standing in his path is Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow , who addressed the situation with a calm, matter-of-fact response ahead of the divisional matchup.Garrett enters the final week of the regular season with 22 sacks, tying the mark set by Michael Strahan in 2001 and T.J. Watt in 2021. While records often bring added tension, Burrow made it clear that he is not planning to approach the game any differently because of the historic chase.Speaking to reporters this week, Burrow acknowledged Garrett’s dominance but dismissed any notion of overthinking the moment. “I’m not going to go out of my way to stop him from getting the record, and I’m not going to go out of my way to let him get it either,” Burrow said. “I’m just going to play football.”Burrow is no stranger to Garrett’s disruptive presence. In fact, Garrett has sacked Burrow more than any other quarterback during his NFL career, a testament to the Browns defender’s impact within the AFC North.Cincinnati’s offensive line has struggled with consistency in recent seasons, making this matchup particularly challenging as Garrett lines up for what could be a defining moment in his career.Despite that history, Burrow framed the situation as part of the natural flow of the game. He noted that there are moments where taking a sack is simply the lesser of two evils, especially when weighed against the risk of a turnover or forced throw.“It’s such a situational game,” Burrow explained. “Sometimes a sack is the best bad outcome. Other times, you get rid of the ball. You can’t go into it thinking about records.”Garrett’s pursuit of the sack record has been one of the few bright spots in a difficult season for the Cleveland Browns, who enter Week 18 out of playoff contention. Even so, the edge rusher’s consistency and explosiveness have drawn praise from across the league, regardless of team success.For Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals, the priority remains finishing the season on a strong note. While Garrett’s milestone looms large, Burrow’s comments underline a broader NFL reality: respect for greatness does not override competitive integrity.","Cleveland Browns pass rusher Myles Garrett is just one sack away from breaking the NFL’s single-season sack record.

Why Gautam Gambhir needs to rethink the extra batting cushion in 2026





NEW DELHI: The Indian squad for the upcoming three-match ODI series against New Zealand at home will be picked on January 3, TOI has learnt. The selected India’s ODI squad will assemble in Vadodara on January 7. The series will begin on January 11 in Vadodara, with the next two matches scheduled to be held in Rajkot on January 14 and Indore on January 18.“The national selection committee, headed by (former India pacer) Ajit Agarkar, will hold an online meeting on Jan 3 to pick the squad,” a source in the BCCI said.The ODI leg of the series is expected to draw significant attention, particularly as it will feature superstars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , who will be in action for the first time since the ODI series against South Africa in Dec. India have already picked the squad for the five-match T20I series against the Kiwis, which will start on Jan 21, while New Zealand have also named both their squads.Having recovered from a neck injury, skipper Shubman Gill, who was recently dropped from India’s squad for the 2026 T20 World Cup, is set to lead the team. However, India’s ODI vice-captain Shreyas Iyer ’s return to action has been delayed, as he will undergo rehabilitation at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence for another week.In a move aimed at workload management, star all-rounder Hardik Pandya and pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah are likely to be rested for the New Zealand series. Both have missed the last two ODI series, and with the T20 World Cup drawing closer, the team management is keen to manage their fitness carefully.It will be interesting to see if the selectors pick Uttar Pradesh’s in-form wicketkeeper-batter Dhruv Jurel, who has scored 307 runs in three matches at an average of 153.5, including 160 not out off 101 balls against Baroda in Rajkot on Dec 29, or Ishan Kishan, if they look to replace Rishabh Pant as the second wicketkeeper.","The Indian squad for the upcoming three-match ODI series against New Zealand will be picked on January 3.

Can Virat Kohli chase down Sachin Tendulkar's hundred hundreds?





Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has publicly backed Shubman Gill , linking the young batter’s rapid rise to a lesson he received early in his own international career from Rahul Dravid Speaking on JioHotstar, Pathan recalled how Dravid prepared him for the demands of international cricket when he broke into the Indian team as a teenager.“When I entered the Indian team at the age of 19, the great Rahul Dravid told me that you have come to the team, it is good, but the things would get tougher from here. I asked what to do in case things get tough. He told me you would get used to it,” Pathan said.Pathan believes the same process of adjustment and growth now applies to Gill, particularly after being handed leadership responsibilities at a young age.“Same can be said for Gill. He became captain, in that England series, he increased his average and authority within the team. Then he got the ODI captaincy, when that happens, you get an opportunity to grow a lot,” he added.Gill’s 2025 began steadily in the ODI format, with consistent returns in bilateral series before playing a key role in India’s ICC Champions Trophy triumph. He finished the tournament with 188 runs, highlighted by a century against Bangladesh.The defining phase of Gill’s year, however, came during his first full Test tour of England. With Rohit Sharma , Virat Kohli and Ravichandran Ashwin unavailable, the burden of leadership fell heavily on the young Test captain.Gill responded with a historic series, scoring 754 runs in five Tests at an average of 75.40, including four centuries and a career-best 269.Pathan also addressed the weight of comparisons that follow elite Indian batters across generations.“He has a lot of talent. There will be always comparisons. Virat was compared with Sachin (Tendulkar), and now Gill is being compared to Virat, who has scored those 25,000–30,000 runs. I think he is fully capable of it. He has a fine range of shots,” Pathan said.Gill’s only notable setback came in T20 internationals, where a run of modest returns saw him score 291 runs in 15 innings at an average just over 24 in 2025, eventually missing out on selection for India’s T20 World Cup squad.Pathan views that phase as part of a broader learning curve.“The more responsibility and challenges he gets, he will grow more as a cricketer. I have seen that he is always ready for cricket. Always willing to learn. He has that attitude in him,” he said.","Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has publicly backed Shubman Gill.

Sarfaraz and Musheer Khan are giving the city’s storied domestic side a fresh jolt of swagger, skill and sparkle, looking every bit the kind of brothers who can shape matches — and seasons — together.Regulars for Mumbai across formats, the siblings bring different strengths to the same cause. Musheer, the batting all-rounder, adds energy in the field and value with his left-arm orthodox spin. Batter Sarfaraz, meanwhile, is as dependable as they come and is also a safe catcher who lifts the group with his intensity and encouragement. There’s never a dull moment when the two are playing together.In the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy (Elite Group C) in Jaipur, Mumbai have stayed on top with four straight wins and the Khan brothers have been central to that surge.Against Uttarakhand and then Goa, they underlined their impact with the bat. Sarfaraz’s blistering 157 off 75 balls against Goa — featuring 14 sixes — lit up the contest as Mumbai piled on a massive 444/8 and sealed an 87-run win. The innings has also reignited the familiar selection debate around Sarfaraz, a conversation that has only grown louder in recent months.Speaking to TOI after the Goa match, Sarfaraz opened up about the bond he shares with his younger brother. “We’ve played together for years, so we understand each other’s game really well. We learn from each other’s successes and failures. Even though he’s much younger, Musheer’s guidance matters because he thinks differently. He’s street-smart and always gives his best,” Sarfaraz said.Sarfaraz, who had endured a lean patch in the Ranji Trophy , has responded with productive outings in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and now the Vijay Hazare Trophy.Musheer, 20, has been equally steady, scoring runs and chipping in with wickets with his left-arm spin. “When we’re in the middle, we keep talking about how to handle a bowler or pace the innings. Musheer always tells me something or the other. Sometimes I get angry, but I never take his suggestions lightly. And I’ve also advised him when he wasn’t doing well,” Sarfaraz added.For now, the 28-year-old isn’t looking too far ahead. If anything, the mission seems simple: keep scoring, keep winning and keep the Khan show rolling.","Sarfaraz and Musheer Khan are giving the city's domestic side a fresh jolt of swagger, skill and sparkle. The siblings bring different strengths to the same cause. Mumbai have stayed on top with four straight wins and the Khan brothers have been central to that surge.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126298411,imgsize-81850,width-400,resizemode-4/sarfaraz-and-musheer.jpg"

Caitlin Clark is a huge Drake Maye fan



Caitlin Clark’s most-awaited recovery and return







With the Super Bowl almost a month away, everyone has their favorites, and so does WNBA’s biggest star, Caitlin Clark. On the recent episode of the “New Heights” podcast hosted by the Kelce brothers, Jason and Travis, the 2024 ROTY winner appeared and sparked a cross-sport debate after naming her favorites for Super Bowl 2026.Though Clark hails from Iowa, she admitted her admiration for the New England Patriots, which is largely influenced by her liking for Patriots star QB Drake Maye. This seemed like a classic case where greatness recognizes and appreciates greatness.The last episode of New Heights for 2025 was anything but not dramatic. In a conversation with Jason and Travis over who is Clark’s favorite to win the next Super Bowl, Caitlin revealed, “I may not be cheering for anybody…but honestly, I am a Drake Maye fan. He’s been incredible.Continuing, she said, “I will probably be pulling for the Patriots, but the Rams are really good too. Sam Darnold seems like a good guy…I could root for him.”Drake Maye and Caitlin Clark began their professional career in 2024 and have been proving to be a cornerstone for their teams. Draye Maye registered a completion rate of 66.6% completing 225-of-338 passes in 2024, over 2,276 yards, and 15 touchdowns.Clark also entered the 2025 season after a historic rookie campaign where she averaged 19.2 points and a league-leading 8.4 assists per game. Though her 2025 season ended early, just after 13 games, due to an injury, the snippets from the USA camp show Clark is healthier and ready to enter the 2026 season with a bang.While the Super Bowl occupies the current headline from who’ll play to who’ll perform at halftime, the Indy fever fans are more concerned with Clark’s physical longevity.Reports suggest her 100% recovery and her focus on strength training to return by the WNBA’s 2026 tip-off. Clark’s return is just not crucial for the Fever, whose offensive strength revolves around her, but also for the league as she’s a walking viewership magnet. The fourth-most-watched WNBA games of 2025 all featured Caitlin Clark and her team. Now, that is some serious digital power flex.Also read: Caitlin Clark and Connor McCaffery's combined net worth 2025: Exploring WNBA power couple’s career earnin","Caitlin Clark is a huge Drake Maye fan.

Good news: Lamar Jackson practices again and looks on track to start AFC North title game vs. Steelers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/good-news-lamar-jackson-practices-again-and-looks-on-track-to-start-afc-north-title-game-vs-steelers/articleshow/126293637.cms,"Derik Hamilton/AP

Lamar Jackson’s full participation is the biggest signal yet about his status





The Baltimore Ravens received a massive boost this week as Lamar Jackson practiced for a second straight day while dealing with a back injury, putting him firmly on track to play in Sunday’s AFC North title game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Even more encouraging, Jackson was listed as a full participant in Wednesday’s practice, a key sign that his availability is trending in the right direction.With the division crown on the line, all signs now point toward Baltimore having its franchise quarterback under center for one of the biggest games of the regular season.Jackson’s practice designation is the headline here. Being a full participant and not limited suggests the Ravens are comfortable with his mobility, workload, and overall health after he dealt with a back issue that sidelined him recently. Practicing on consecutive days matters as well, especially this late in the week, because it indicates recovery momentum rather than a one-off appearance.For quarterbacks, back injuries can be tricky, particularly for someone whose game relies so heavily on movement and improvisation. That makes Jackson logging full reps a crucial development rather than just a routine update.This isn’t just any Week 18 game. Sunday’s matchup against Pittsburgh effectively decides the AFC North, and Lamar Jackson’s presence dramatically changes the stakes.With Jackson, the Ravens’ offense opens up vertically and horizontally. Baltimore controls time of possession more effectively, the Steelers’ defense must account for both designed runs and broken-play chaosWithout him, Baltimore’s offense becomes far more predictable and easier to contain. That contrast is why Jackson’s return to full practice immediately shifted expectations around the game.While the signs are overwhelmingly positive, the Ravens are still expected to monitor Jackson closely through the end of the week. Official game status won’t be locked in until final injury reports are released, and teams rarely rush to make definitive declarations early.That said, players who practice fully on Wednesday and follow it up with another practice day almost always trend toward starting. Barring any late-week setback, Jackson is widely expected to be available Sunday.Also read - Christian Barmore domestic assault charge explained as case heads to arraignment",Lamar Jackson was listed as a full participant in Wednesday’s practice.

Special highway tribute turns emotional as Stephen Curry celebrates his iconic No. 30 legacy at Davidson





In the last game of their three-game East Coast road trip to wrap off the 2025 season, the Golden State Warriors will take on the Charlotte Hornets on New Year's Eve. Before starting against the Hornets, Stephen Curry returned to his college, Davidson, which is situated just outside of Charlotte.Curry was present at Davidson's men's basketball game last night as the ""Stephen Curry Interchange sign that now marks Exit 30 on Interstate 77"" was unveiled. At the halftime ceremony, Curry ""removed a black cover alongside his father, Dell, to reveal the highway sign honoring his legacy"" at the school.On Tuesday night, the All-Star point guard attended Davidson's game against Duquesne at John M. Belk Arena. When Curry was a student at Davidson, he received a special accolade from his alma mater. In front of the crowd, Davidson said that Exit 30 on I-77 in North Carolina will now be referred to as the ""Steph Curry Interchange.""Davidson President Douglas Hicks said:The entire John M. Belk Arena ""reflected Curry's impact."" Children and adults ""wore his No. 30 jersey—Davidson throwbacks and Warriors gear... Everyone knows that the entrance to Davidson is Exit 30, and we hope that your heart will always lead you back to (the town of) Davidson and Davidson College.""Curry averaged 25.3 points per game across his three seasons at Davidson, shooting 46.7% from the field and 41.2% from beyond the arc. As a sophomore, Curry led Davidson to an unprecedented run in the NCAA tournament, guiding the No. 10 seed Wildcats to the Elite Eight.
