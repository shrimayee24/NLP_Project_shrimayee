NEW DELHI: BJP launched a digital offensive against Pakistan on Friday, mocking its failed military retaliation after Operation Sindoor and exposing Islamabad’s use of fake news to project false victories.In a symbolic jab, BJP shared a 31-second clip from the tied India-Pakistan match during the 2007 T20 World Cup, where India clinched a 3-0 bowl-out win. Indian bowlers Virender Sehwag, Harbhajan Singh and Robin Uthappa hit the stumps with precision while Pakistan’s Yasir Arafat, Umar Gul and Shahid Afridi failed completely. “Kuch aisa tha.

The claim was so outrageous that even Dawn, Pakistan’s leading newspaper, felt compelled to fact-check and debunk it,” he added.","BJP posts video of India-Pakistan match during 2007 ICC World T20.

NHL legend Theo Fleury slams PM Mark Carney in blunt social media attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-legend-theo-fleury-slams-pm-mark-carney-in-blunt-social-media-attack/articleshow/121185053.cms,"Theo Fleury’s blunt take on PM Carney fuels national debate (Image via: Getty Images)

Theo Fleury’s post puts PM Carney’s unity message to the test



Theo Fleury’s words ignite a national debate



FULL: Prime Minister Mark Carney's first remarks after naming new cabinet ministers

Canadian hockey great Theo Fleury isn’t mincing words when it comes to the country's new leadership. The Stanley Cup champion and longtime Calgary Flames winger stirred up a political firestorm this week after taking a sharp jab at newly appointed Prime Minister Mark Carney . His message was brief, bold, and impossible to ignore: “Not my PM.”The comment, posted to X (formerly Twitter), came just hours after Carney delivered his inaugural address promising to represent all Canadians and bridge political divides.Mark Carney, Canada’s 25th Prime Minister, officially stepped into office in March and recently introduced his first cabinet—a 24-member team that includes 15 full ministers and 9 secretaries of state. The new government has emphasized inclusion and national healing, but Fleury’s reaction paints a starkly different picture of how some Canadians feel.While Carney called for unity, Fleury tapped into a wave of discontent that has been simmering across the nation. With his concise yet pointed post, the former NHL star made it clear that not everyone is on board with the country’s current direction, highlighting deep divisions and frustration felt by many citizens.Once known for his relentless hustle on the ice, Fleury has reinvented himself as a fierce and often polarizing voice in Canadian political circles. Over the past few years, he’s been outspoken on issues ranging from government overreach to freedom of speech, and this latest post is just another example of his no-holds-barred commentary. His blunt approach continues to resonate strongly with those dissatisfied with the political establishment.Supporters say Fleury is expressing frustrations many Canadians are afraid to voice, applauding him for standing his ground. Critics, however, argue that his high-profile platform adds fuel to an already divided landscape, questioning whether athletes-turned-activists help or harm public discourse.Regardless of which side you're on, Fleury's post has once again proven one thing, when he speaks, people pay attention. His legacy on the ice may be etched in history, but his impact off it, especially in the political arena is only growing louder.Also Read: Sergei Bobrovsky under fire as Panthers rely on defense, not their $10M goalie As Mark Carney begins his journey as Prime Minister of Canada , he faces not only economic and social challenges but also the growing distrust of prominent Canadians like Fleury. With issues such as inflation, unemployment, and climate policy at the forefront, the question now is: can he win over the skeptics, rebuild public trust, and unite the country, or is this just the start of a deeper national divide fueled by political polarization and economic uncertainty? The coming months will reveal whether his leadership can bridge these divides and guide Canada toward stability and growth.","Theo Fleury stirred up a political firestorm this week after taking a sharp jab at newly appointed Prime Minister Mark Carney.

India’s golden boy of athletics, Neeraj Chopra , scripted history on Friday evening at the Doha Diamond League 2025 by breaching the elusive 90-metre barrier in men’s javelin throw for the first time in his career. The reigning world champion recorded a best throw of 90.23 metres, becoming only the 25th athlete in history to cross the prestigious mark. However, despite his personal milestone, Chopra had to settle for second place as Germany’s Julian Weber stole the show with a winning throw of 91.06 metres.Competing at the Qatar Sports Club Stadium , Neeraj got off to a brilliant start with a strong 88.44m throw in his very first attempt, which immediately put him in the lead. His second attempt was a foul, but he bounced back in style with his third — launching the javelin to a staggering 90.23 metres. That effort not only marked a career-best for Chopra but also made him the latest entrant in the elite 90m club, a mark considered the gold standard in javelin throwing.Julian Weber, however, had other plans. The German athlete, a consistent performer on the Diamond League circuit, saved his best for the day — unleashing a mighty 91.06m throw that edged out Chopra and earned him the top podium finish.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? The milestone comes at an exciting phase in Neeraj’s career. Now under the guidance of legendary coach Jan Zelezny a three-time Olympic champion and world record holder with a throw of 98.48m , Neeraj appears to be peaking just in time for a packed athletics season. This was Chopra’s first major competition of the year after switching coaches, and his performance in Doha will surely raise expectations ahead of the Olympics and other major events.Chopra’s feat adds him to an exclusive group of 25 javelin throwers worldwide who have thrown beyond 90 metres a club that includes greats like Zelezny himself, Johannes Vetter, Thomas Röhler, and Arshad Nadeem. The 90m throw has been achieved just 126 times in history, underlining the rarity and difficulty of the achievement.Although he didn’t win the event, Neeraj’s performance has reignited excitement among Indian sports fans and experts alike, signalling a new chapter in his illustrious journey. As one of the most decorated athletes in Indian history, Neeraj continues to push boundaries, and with the 90m milestone now conquered, his sights are firmly set on even bigger glories.This Doha meet was especially crucial as Chopra will not compete later this month due to the cancellation of the NC Classic 2025 in Bengaluru. With a statement performance in Qatar, he has laid down a strong marker for the rest of the season.A strong run from India’s Parul Chaudhary saw her set a new national record in the women’s 3000m steeplechase, clocking 9:13.39 to finish a commendable sixth in a high-quality field in Doha.With this performance, Chaudhary not only raised the national benchmark but also improved significantly on her 16th-place Diamond League debut in Eugene last year.",Neeraj Chopra recorded a best throw of 90.23 metres at the Doha Diamond League 2025.

Juan Soto’s cool reaction to Yankees fans' boos goes viral after Mets debut in Bronx



Juan Soto knew what was coming, and still, the moment had an electric, almost cinematic, weight to it. As the New York Mets superstar walked up to the plate at Yankee Stadium on Friday night, the Bronx faithful erupted—not in admiration, but in fury. It was a chorus of 50,000 voices united in disapproval, just as he had predicted. “50,000 fans against one,” Soto told the New York Post ahead of the Mets-Yankees clash. He wasn’t wrong.Despite the storm of boos, there was an odd poetry in the moment. Soto, ever the showman, tipped his helmet and flashed a grin, even mouthing what appeared to be a “thank you” to the home crowd. It was his first time back in the Bronx since Game 5 of the 2024 World Series—this time wearing the colors of the Mets, not the pinstripes that once defined his sensational 2024 season.In that unforgettable year, Soto had delivered an MVP-caliber performance for the Yankees—slashing .288/.419/.569 with a career-high 41 home runs and helping power the team to its first World Series appearance since 2009. His towering, go-ahead homer in the 10th inning of Game 5 of the ALCS had practically etched him into Yankee lore. But that chapter ended unexpectedly when Soto opted for a 15-year, $765 million megadeal with the Mets—just $5 million more guaranteed than the Yankees' 16-year offer.The decision stung, and Yankee fans made sure he felt it. While his first at-bat resulted in a five-pitch walk off Carlos Rodón, it wasn’t about the stats that night—it was about the theater.And the Bronx Bleacher Creatures added their own twist to the drama. When Soto took his position in right field in the bottom of the first inning, they turned their backs to him—a symbolic act of betrayal felt by the fans during his free agency departure.Oddly enough, buried beneath the thunderous boos was a standing ovation—perhaps the crowd’s way of acknowledging his past heroics while simultaneously expressing their heartbreak.For Soto, it was a homecoming defined by tension, emotion, and undeniable star power. He walked away unshaken, wearing the boos like a badge of honor.Also Read: Juan Soto returns to Yankee Stadium and gets booed in a bizarre way","Juan Soto faced boos from Yankees fans during his first at-bat in the Bronx.

"""You'll never be as good as your dad"": How brutal criticism pushed Wayne Gretzky's son Ty Gretzky away from pro hockey",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/youll-never-be-as-good-as-your-dad-how-brutal-criticism-pushed-wayne-gretzkys-son-ty-gretzky-away-from-pro-hockey/articleshow/121163848.cms,"Wayne Gretzky son Ty Gretzky faced immense pressure growing up (Image via Instagram)

Being the son of “The Great One” came with more pressure than praise for young Ty Gretzky

Growing up in the shadow of hockey’s most iconic figure is no easy feat — just ask Ty Gretzky . As the eldest son of NHL legend Wayne Gretzky , Ty was never just another kid on the ice. Every shift, every goal, and every stumble came with a heavy dose of scrutiny — from teammates, rivals, and even strangers in the stands.In a candid 2006 interview with The New York Times, a 15-year-old Ty Gretzky opened up about the harsh realities of being Wayne Gretzky’s son. “I get smack-talked all the time on the ice from other players,” he said. “Just like, ‘I thought you were going to be a lot better,’ stuff like that.”Even at a young age, Ty was dealing with the weight of impossible expectations. Despite having a passion for the game, his last name made it nearly impossible to play without comparison. Speaking to Thousand Oaks Acorn, he admitted to eventually removing his last name from his jersey in an effort to blend in: “Somehow people in the stands would just find out who I was and yell, ‘You’ll never be as good as your dad in hockey.’”The pressure didn’t stop there. During his second year playing center for a lower-tier team at Shattuck-St. Mary’s School — a well-known hockey academy — Ty managed four goals and six assists over 29 games. Still, his stats were often overshadowed by his surname. “It wasn’t just about playing hockey anymore,” Ty implied. “It became about living up to a legacy I didn’t ask for.”Ultimately, Ty chose not to pursue hockey professionally, but he never abandoned the game. Instead, he found a meaningful way to stay connected to the sport — and to his father. In 2014, he co-founded The Gretzky Hockey School alongside Wayne, creating a space where young players can develop their skills without the burden of comparison.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's son Ty Gretzky’s Mother’s Day post hides a deeper message about family legacy Ty’s story is a poignant reminder that even in the world of sports royalty, carving out your own identity can be the biggest challenge of all.","Ty Gretzky is the eldest son of NHL legend Wayne Gretzki.

Conor McGregor’s vague comeback statement continues to be a mere gimmick as UFC CEO Dana White dismisses any possible bout for the fighter

MMA fans finally have an answer, as the, on Friday, May 16, 2025, dismissed the idea of Conor McGregor ’s return to the Octagon. Supporters of the Irish fighter had a hope when the Notorious recently posted a set of cryptic words on his Instagram story, which were still dicey owing to the fighter’s previous vague statements of picking up the gloves again.Former UFC champion Conor McGregor was last seen going head-on against Dustin Poirier at UFC 264, where the former broke his leg during the bout. Post that, the Irish fighter was supposed to face Michael Chandler at UFC 303 but had to withdraw owing to a toe injury. Since then, there have been no signs of the fighter stepping back into the Octagon anytime soon. Instead of any concrete announcement or confirmation of a comeback bout, the fighter engages in posting occasional training clips and cryptic statements that partly hint at his return to the Octagon.Recently, the fighter was seen posting a series of cryptic messages on his Instagram stories directed towards the UFC executives and the boss, Dana White. Across two different stories, his statements read“@danawhite @tkogroup call that big b**t nurse”“Let’s get this show started @ufc”It has been quite some time since the fighter had last tagged the promotion and its executives directly in a comeback statement. Which is why fans were somewhat more optimistic rather than being sceptical about McGregor’s potential comeback.But much to the dismay of the community, Dana White, on May 16, made a revelation about his recent interaction with McGregor, which crushed the hopes of the fans. In a recent clip, the UFC CEO makes a statement about the potential comeback of the fighter, “He is not fighting anytime soon. I haven’t talked to him in a minute. Yeah…I don’t know.”Also read: UFC color commentator Daniel Cormier reacts to heavyweight champion Jon Jones’ hypothetical claims Dana White, plain and simple, dismissed the fighter’s supposed request that was made via the Instagram stories. Fighters like Michael Chandler, too, waited for McGregor to step back into the Octagon before finally moving on with other fighters, thereby concentrating on their own careers. With White’s statement, McGregor’s claims become irrelevant, and fans can now be assured about the probable future of the fighter inside the Octagon.","Conor McGregor was last seen going head-on against Dustin Poirier at UFC 264.

Jury dismissed after claims of inappropriate conduct from defense lawyers

Players charged in connection with 2018 Hockey Canada event

Survivor testifies about traumatic night and lack of consent

The high-profile sexual assault trial involving five former Canadian hockey players took an unexpected and serious turn Friday when Ontario Superior Court Justice Maria Carroccia dismissed the jury due to allegations of misconduct by defense attorneys. The move will now place the responsibility of the verdict solely in the hands of the judge.The decision followed a formal complaint from a juror who submitted a note stating that multiple jury members felt mocked and ridiculed by the defense lawyers as they entered the courtroom. The juror alleged that attorneys Daniel Brown and Hilary Dudding—who represent one of the accused—laughed at them during proceedings. Both lawyers have firmly denied the accusation.Though Justice Carroccia stated she had not observed any behavior from counsel that concerned her directly, she acknowledged that the jurors’ perception of bias could affect the impartiality of the trial. “The jurors’ negative impression of the defense could impact the jury’s impartiality and was a problem that could not be remedied,” she concluded, thereby opting for a judge-only trial moving forward.The case involves five former junior hockey players—Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube, Carter Hart , Cal Foote, and Alex Formenton—who were charged in 2024 following renewed investigations into a 2018 incident in London, Ontario. The alleged assault took place during a Hockey Canada gala celebrating their world junior championship win. McLeod faces an additional charge of being a party to the offense.All five men have pleaded not guilty and are currently not affiliated with any NHL team or under contract.The woman at the center of the case testified remotely, stating that she was drunk, naked, and frightened when multiple men entered a hotel room. “I felt I had to go along with what the men wanted me to do,” she said. The prosecution argues that the men never made efforts to confirm consent.Defense attorneys, however, challenged her credibility during extensive cross-examinations, suggesting she willingly participated. She responded that she has no memory of initiating anything and insisted the players should have known she was in no condition to consent.Also Read: Mitch Marner’s last stand in Toronto?

It was about what Rohit represents: consistency, calm, class and the people who’ve journeyed with him, quietly in the background.Surya’s message read:""Congratulations @rohitsharma45 on achieving incredible things on the cricket ground, from finisher to opener to our captain, you have been an inspiration and our pride, in every role.Very rarely comes a leader who leads from the front, and changes the game for better. You are that leader, who has changed not just the game, but the approach, the attitude, the dressing room atmosphere, the team and redefined the role of a captain.Like I have said before, good things happen to good people, and you deserve it all and more. Wankhede just got even more iconic..""Also present was MI owner Akash Ambani , who called Rohit's honour “a moment that will inspire an entire generation.”With over 19,700 international runs, 49 centuries, a 2024 T20 World Cup title, and five IPL championships, Rohit’s cricketing stats are monumental but it was Ritika’s silent tears that perhaps spoke loudest. A reminder that behind every great athlete is a story of partnership, perseverance, and unconditional love.","The Mumbai Cricket Association unveiled the Rohit Sharma Stand at the Wankhede Stadium. Ritika Sajdeh was seen holding back tears as her husband’s name lit up the iconic stadium. The moment wasn’t just a tribute to Rohit's cricketing journey, it was a culmination of years of dedication, sacrifice, and support behind the scenes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121216323,imgsize-219656,width-400,resizemode-4/Rohit-Sharma-with-his-wife-Ritika-Sajdeh-and-daughter-Samaira.jpg"

Bill Belichick addresses relationship with Jordon Hudson amid media scrutiny and UNC Football commitments



Bill Belichick has spent decades mastering the art of keeping his personal life out of the headlines but that’s changed in a big way. The legendary coach, now leading UNC football, is making waves off the field thanks to his relationship with 24-year-old girlfriend Jordon Hudson . From media interviews to viral moments, their relationship has become a hot topic and for the first time, Belichick is opening up about it. So what does Hudson really mean to him, and how does she fit into his famously focused world?Belichick’s relationship with Hudson has become a lightning rod for media attention in recent weeks. From an awkward interview on CBS Sunday Morning to being featured in the Atlanta Falcons’ 2025 schedule release video, the romance has become part of the sports conversation, whether the coach likes it or not.Speaking to SportsCenter during the ACC Spring Meetings , Belichick made it clear that Hudson is not involved in North Carolina football. “She does the business things that don't relate to North Carolina that come up in my life so I can concentrate on football,” he stated. Hudson, who helped with his recent book, especially the tribute pages has become, as Belichick put it, a grounding presence behind the scenes.In a follow-up appearance on Good Morning America, co-host Michael Strahan asked what Jordon means to him. Belichick replied, “We have a good personal relationship,” before quickly pivoting away from further personal discussion.For a coach who has built his legacy on tunnel vision and minimal distractions, the relationship has sparked a unique blend of curiosity and criticism. With an age gap of nearly 50 years and Belichick’s role as a high-profile figure at UNC, the scrutiny is understandable, even if it’s unwelcome.Also Read: Dallas Cowboys and Micah Parsons locked in intense contract negotiations over $200 Million deal Still, the legendary coach insists he’s happy and focused. Despite the headlines, he’s maintaining his grip on football operations, while Hudson supports him from the periphery.

Who was the NFL player linked to Cassie Ventura, Diddy's ex?

The names of celebrities mentioned during Sean “Diddy” Combs’ sex-trafficking trial continued to surface on Friday and brought forward another singer accused of abuse, Chris Brown. A mystery NFL player has also been mentioned during the trial, whom Diddy suspected was having an affair with Cassie Ventura.Brown’s appearance came when Combs’ lawyer inquired of Cassie Ventura about a time when the Bad Boy Records mogul was angry with her. The rapper and singer is just one of several celebrities whose names have been brought up during testimony in Combs’ trial, which is now nearing the end of its first week.Britney Spears was mentioned on Thursday because Combs had invited the pop star to Ventura’s 21st birthday celebration at a Vegas nightclub. Actor Michael B. Jordan and rapper Kid Cudi also came up because they had been romantically linked with Ventura.The court also revealed on Friday how Combs once snatched Ventura’s phone from her hand while they were in a car together, suspecting she was dating a professional football player.Ventura testified about the August 2016 incident, where Combs drove down Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles with her phone. She explained that her mother eventually called the police after she returned home without the phone. The identity of the NFL athlete wasn’t disclosed, but Ventura confirmed he was a professional NFL player at the time.Ventura, a mother of two who is eight months pregnant, shared that she underwent mental health treatment at the Willow House facility in Arizona for 45 days in 2023, receiving the same therapy that Prince Harry did.She described to jurors that during her stay at the facility, she participated in eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), which “is part of trauma therapy … my understanding is it helps me recount memories and process them.”Ventura, who has been sober since 2022, also testified about undergoing various other treatments at Willow House. Combs has pleaded not guilty to multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering. If convicted, he could face life in prison.","Chris Brown is one of several celebrities who have been mentioned during Diddy's sex-trafficking trial.

Melinda French Gates’ dream which changed her life

Melinda Gates says she suffered panic attacks

Microsoft founder Bill Gates ex-wife Melinda French Gates has revealed that a recurring dream played an important role in her decision to end her 27-year marriage. The divorce, which was finalised in 2021, followed the surfacing of certain information that impacted the couple's relationship. In a recent interview Melinda French Gates revealed that she experienced recurring nightmares in late 2019. She claimed that the dream turned out be a turning point in her journey.In an interview with enterprenuer Jamie Kern Lima, French Gates described her symbolic dream. Melinda French Gates described that in her dream, she saw that she was standing on a cliff along with Bill Gates and their children. As the dream progressed, the portion of the cliff where she stood began to crumble and break away. This imagery had a profound effect on her, which she interpreted as a clear sign that she needed to separate from Bill and move forward on her own.“I was going to have to make a decision—and I was going to have to make it by myself,” she recalled.""Some dreams will take me years to understand, but if they’re recurring, I know I need to pay attention to them,” added Melinda Gates.While the dream served as a catalyst, Melinda's decision was also influenced by other factors. While she did not disclose specific details, Melinda acknowledged that certain things came out publicly, reinforcing her decision to leave the marriage. She referenced Bill Gates’ past meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, which she described as deeply disturbing. Bill has previously admitted that associating with Epstein was a mistake.In a recent candid interview with The Times, French Gates addressed Bill Gates’ remarks about their divorce. She said, “If you can’t live your values out inside your most intimate relationship, it was necessary.”French Gates also opened up about the emotional strain of the divorce, sharing that she experienced panic attacks throughout the separation. “When you’re leaving a marriage, it’s very, very hard. And the negotiations were tough,” she said.She shared that her first panic attack occurred in 2014 while having lunch with Gates, prompting her to begin therapy. “I’d heard of people having panic attacks and I didn’t know if it was a real thing,” she said.Initially skeptical of therapy, French Gates admitted she later came to understand its value. “It doesn’t mean I’m damaged,” she explained. “It means I’ve been through some difficult things that I need to figure out.”Following the divorce, both Bill and Melinda Gates have continued their philanthropic efforts, though they are no longer working together as a couple. Bill Gates has publicly expressed regret about the divorce, acknowledging his role in the dissolution of their marriage.","Melinda French Gates has revealed that a recurring dream played an important role in her decision to end her 27-year marriage to Bill Gates.

Poll Which player do you believe has the most potential to lead India’s Test team? Rishabh Pant Shubman Gill

IPL 2025: The unsung heroes of India's T20 league

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer and ex-head coach Ravi Shastri has advocated for a forward-thinking approach in selecting India's next Test captain after Rohit Sharma’s retirement from the format. Rohit recently stepped away from Test cricket but confirmed that he will continue to play ODIs. He had earlier retired from T20 internationals after leading India to the 2024 T20 World Cup title in the West Indies.Speaking on The ICC Review, Shastri shared his perspective on the ongoing discussion surrounding the vacant Test captaincy.In a conversation with host Sanjana Ganesan, Shastri emphasized the need for a future-oriented mindset and advised against burdening India’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah with leadership duties.“See for me, Jasprit would have been the obvious choice after Australia,” Shastri said.“But I don’t want Jasprit to be made captain and then you lose him as a bowler.”Shastri highlighted Bumrah’s recent battle with a back injury that he sustained during the final Border-Gavaskar Trophy match in Sydney. The injury sidelined him for almost three months, from early January to April, forcing him to miss India’s triumphant ICC Champions Trophy 2025 campaign.“I think he (Bumrah) has to take his body one game at a time. He's coming back now after a serious injury,"" Shastri noted.“He'll have played IPL cricket, which is four-over cricket. Now will come the test of bowling 10 overs, 15 overs. And the last thing you want is some pressure on his mind being captain as well.”Instead of putting extra responsibility on Bumrah, Shastri backed Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant as suitable candidates for Test captaincy, stressing the importance of age and longevity.“You groom somebody and I would say Shubman’s looked very good. Give him the opportunity. He's 25, 26 years of age, even give him time,"" Shastri said.“There's Rishabh as well. I think these two are the obvious ones I'm looking at because of their age and they have a decade ahead of them. So, let them learn.”Shastri also pointed out that with Rohit and Virat Kohli recently stepping away from the Test format, the team must look ahead, further bolstering the case for Gill or Pant.Both players come with leadership experience, having captained their IPL franchises — Gill with Gujarat Titans and Pant with Delhi Capitals.“They've got experience as captains, now, captaining their franchise and that makes a difference,"" Shastri noted.""The little I've seen of Shubman looks very interesting. Composed, calm, he has all the qualities,” said Shastri, praising the temperament of the top-ranked batter in the ICC ODI Player Rankings.Addressing concerns about Gill’s performance overseas, Shastri dismissed the criticism outright.“You people will talk he's not scored runs overseas. You know, that topic always comes, not scored runs overseas,” he said.“Sometimes I tell them, go and see your own record, how much have you done overseas? Overseas, overseas, let him play, let him get a run overseas, then he'll score runs. He's a class player.”Gill, who has already served as India's vice-captain in ODIs, also captained the national side in a T20I series in Zimbabwe. India won the series 4-1, with Gill scoring 170 runs across five innings at a strike rate of 125.92, including a highest score of 66 in the third T20I — a match India won by 23 runs.“He has a decade of cricket ahead of him for the country,"" Shastri said.""And I'm sure he'll get cracking in one of the tours, he'll make up for all those runs he's not got on earlier.""",Former India cricketer Ravi Shastri says Jasprit Bumrah should not be given Test captaincy. He backs Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant as suitable candidates for the role.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

NEW DELHI: It was a ""bitter-sweet"" outing for Neeraj Chopra at the Doha Diamond League , where he finally breached the elusive 90m mark but still had to settle for second place. The 27-year-old Indian javelin star, who has battled a persistent groin injury in recent years, looked back in top shape as he hurled the spear to a career-best 90.23m in his third attempt. With that, Chopra became the third Asian and 25th athlete overall to achieve a 90m-plus throw — a prestigious club led by his current coach, Czech legend Jan Zelezny.However, Germany’s Julian Weber had the final say in Doha. He snatched victory with a last-gasp effort of 91.06m, surpassing Chopra’s mark and pushing the Indian Olympic gold medallist to second spot, despite leading until the final round.Having finally crossed the 90m threshold — a mark he had been chasing for five years — Chopra said there’s more to come, especially now that he’s feeling close to fully fit. The focus now shifts to refining his technique with coach Zelezny, under whose guidance Chopra has been training since February, although the partnership officially began in November.""I am very happy with the 90m mark but it's a little bit of a bitter-sweet experience actually. But never mind, I and my coach are still working on some aspects of my throw. We started working together only in February this year. I am still learning things,"" Chopra said after the competition.""I was always feeling something in my groin in the last few years. I did not give my best because of that. This year I feel much better, we will also work on some aspects and so I believe I can throw more than 90m in the upcoming events this year till the World Championships.""The World Championships are scheduled to take place in Tokyo from September 13 to 21.Asked about his next target now that the 90m mark has been ticked off, Chopra said, ""My next goal is just 90m. I believe I am ready to throw farther. It's just the beginning of a long season.""I am very happy that Jan Zelezny is my coach and we worked very hard in South Africa. We are still working on some aspects.""Chopra credited the favourable conditions in Doha for helping him unleash the big throw and shared that Zelezny had predicted a 90m effort even before the competition.""When I was having warm-up throws my coach said today is the day when I can throw 90m. After my 90m throw also, he told me I can throw 2-3m farther.""The wind helps for sure and the weather is a little warm and that helps. It's the first competition of the year, so everyone came with a fresh mindset after a long time and has hunger inside for the throwing part.""I also told Julian (Weber) that we can throw 90m. I am also happy for him. We have tried very hard for 90m for so many years, and so we are happy. It's like a good push between us and in the next competition we will push each other again and will throw farther,"" he added.This wasn't the first time Chopra had finished runner-up after a record throw.""It had happened earlier also. When I threw an NR with over 89m in Turku, I finished second. In Stockholm DL, when I threw 89.94m, I was second again, so also here,"" he said.Meanwhile, Weber, who also breached the 90m mark for the first time, expressed joy over the competition and Chopra’s breakthrough.""I did not know how it happened. I had a very good massage thanks to my physiotherapist. It was fun today. Neeraj threw his first 90m plus and I went past the mark in my last throw and that was just perfect.""I was very happy for him. We have been fighting for the 90m throw for a long time and we both achieved that today. So, it was very special for us.""Weber’s 91.06m effort — the best in the world this season so far — made him the 26th athlete to breach the coveted distance.Two-time world champion and Paris Olympics bronze medallist Anderson Peters of Grenada finished third with a best of 84.65m, registered on his opening attempt.",Neeraj Chopra threw a career-best 90.23m at the Doha Diamond League.

Two-time Olympic medallist Neeraj Chopra on Thursday clarified that he and Arshad Nadeem were never close ""friends"" and indicated that the recent tensions following the Pahalgam attack , which significantly strained India-Pakistan relations, would likely affect their future interactions.""First of all, I really want to clarify that I don't have a very strong relationship [with Arshad Nadeem],"" he told reporters ahead of the Doha Diamond League ""Yes, as athletes, we do interact. I have some good friends within the athletic community and from all around the world. Furthermore, if someone addresses me respectfully, I reciprocate that respect.""""

The IPL resumes on Saturday after a 10-day break caused by India-Pakistan border tensions, with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) facing Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in a crucial clash at M Chinnaswamy Stadium . RCB, second on the table with 16 points from 11 matches, need a win to secure a playoff berth, while sixth-placed KKR must win to keep their knockout hopes alive. The break disrupted both teams’ momentum — RCB were on a four-match winning streak, while KKR had won two of their last three.RCB appear better equipped to handle the restart, with skipper Rajat Patidar returning to nets after a finger injury and key overseas players like Phil Salt, Tim David, and Liam Livingstone back in the squad. However, injuries to Devdutt Padikkal and Josh Hazlewood remain concerns.The spotlight will be on Virat Kohli following his sudden Test retirement. Fans are expected to show support by wearing whites, though Kohli will rely on inner fire to deliver a strong performance.KKR's struggles lie in inconsistent batting, with only Ajinkya Rahane and Angkrish Raghuvanshi showing form. While their bowling unit has held firm, the absence of Moeen Ali due to illness adds to their challenges.The Chinnaswamy pitch has so far favoured the bowlers, offering unexpected assistance in the form of bounce for pacers and bite for spinners. However, the extended break and the onset of the monsoon may have altered its behaviour, prompting teams to reassess and adapt their strategies accordingly.Jacob Bethell, Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar (c), Jitesh Sharma (wk), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Romario Shepherd, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Lungi Ngidi, Yash DayalImpact Sub: Suyash Sharma/Liam LivingstoneRahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Manish Pandey, Andre Russell, Rinku Singh, Ramandeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Vaibhav Arora, Varun ChakaravarthyImpact Sub: Anukul RoyThe IPL’s restart in Bengaluru may face weather disruptions, with thunderstorms and showers expected on Saturday evening.

NEW DELHI: A day after announcing his retirement from Test cricket, Indian batting legend Virat Kohli visited Vrindavan with his wife, Anushka Sharma , to seek guidance from the spiritual leader Premanand Maharaj. The couple visited Shri Hit Radha Keli Kunj Ashram in Vrindavan to receive blessings.Photos of Kohli and Anushka interacting with Premanand Maharaj in Vrindavan quickly went viral on social media.After leaving the ashram, Kohli was spotted exiting his car holding a Jaap counting machine . He waved to fans briefly before walking quietly into the airport.Kohli is set to take the field for Royal Challengers Bangalore in their IPL 2025 match against Kolkata Knight Riders on Saturday.On Monday, Kohli announced his retirement from Test cricket, marking the end of a stellar career in the longest format. He played 123 Tests for India, amassing 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85, including 30 centuries.As captain, Kohli led India to 40 wins in 68 Tests, the most by any Indian skipper to date.Former India coach Ravi Shastri described Kohli as “mentally fried and overcooked” due to constant public scrutiny. While surprised by Kohli’s decision to retire, Shastri believed the star batter still had two to three years left in Test cricket.Shastri also revealed that he had spoken to Kohli shortly before the announcement was made public.""I did speak to him about it, I think a week before that [his announcement] and his mind was very clear that he'd given us everything. There were no regrets,"" Shastri told The ICC Review.""Virat surprised me because I thought he had at least two-three years of Test match cricket left in him.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on IPL, India-Australia rivalry | Part 1

Former India head coach Ravi Shastri has admitted that Virat Kohli ’s decision to retire from Test cricket caught him off guard, especially since he felt the star batter had a few more years of red-ball cricket left in him. Kohli, who called time on his Test career on Monday, finished with 123 matches, 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85, including 30 centuries — a glittering resume by any standard.Shastri revealed that he had spoken to Kohli just a week before the announcement and sensed that the decision had already been made.""I did speak to him about it, I think a week before that [his announcement] and his mind was very clear that he'd given us everything. There were no regrets,"" Shastri told The ICC Review.""Virat surprised me because I thought he had at least two-three years of Test match cricket left in him.

Individually, as a bowler, as a batsman,"" said Shastri, who shared a successful captain-coach partnership with Kohli.""A player does his job, [and] then you sit back. But [with Kohli] when the team goes out, it's as if he has to take all the wickets, he has to take all the catches, he has to make all the decisions on the field.""That much involvement, I would think there's going to be a burnout somewhere if he doesn't take a rest, if he doesn't compartmentalise how much he wants to play across formats, there is bound to be a burnout.""Together, the Kohli-Shastri duo delivered one of Indian cricket's most successful Test phases — from a maiden series win in Australia to back-to-back wins in the West Indies and ending a two-decade-long drought in Sri Lanka.According to Shastri, there is nothing left for Kohli to prove in the game.""At times when you quit the game, you know, and after a month or two months you say, 'I wish I had done this, I wish I had done this,"" he said.""[Kohli] He's done everything.

Micah Parsons contract talks highlight Dallas Cowboys’ salary cap pressure



Do Ravens or Bills have better odds of winning SB, Micah Parsons: Cowboys will have 12 wins | SPEAK

The Dallas Cowboys and Micah Parsons are at the center of a heated contract standoff grabbing the attention of NFL fans and experts alike. Reports claimed a handshake deal was already in place, but Parsons quickly took to social media to label those rumors as completely false. The core issue is Parsons seeking a massive $200 million extension that would not only break records for defensive players but also make him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history, surpassing Ja’Marr Chase’s recent $161 million deal.Micah Parsons is no ordinary player. As a four-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro, his dominance on the field has earned him superstar status. The Dallas Cowboys have shown they are willing to invest heavily in their top talent, recently signing Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb to major contracts. However, Parsons’ contract negotiations are progressing at a different pace, raising questions about the team’s salary cap flexibility and their approach to negotiations. Some wonder if the Cowboys are holding back to control Parsons’ demands, or if they are simply limited by the financial commitments they have already made.Adding to the uncertainty is the public clash between media reports and Parsons’ own statements, which has created confusion about the transparency of the talks. The longer the Cowboys delay, the more leverage Parsons gains, especially since his current contract only covers this season. The possibility of a holdout is becoming more real, which could disrupt Dallas’ defensive plans and affect team chemistry.Also Read: Is Travis Kelce escaping to $20M Florida estate amid NFL offseason and media spotlight on relationship with Taylor Swift? In the end, both Parsons and the Cowboys appear committed to building a future together. The key question is how much Dallas is willing to pay to keep their defensive star. Contracts of this size are rare in today’s NFL and require a careful balance between player value and salary cap management. As the season opener nears, pressure is mounting for both sides to reach an agreement. Whether the Cowboys finalize the deal or the standoff continues, the outcome will play a major role in shaping the team’s competitive future and could redefine the market for defensive players across the league.","The Dallas Cowboys and Micah Parsons are at the center of a heated contract standoff.

Save percentage on cycle plays distinguishes Frederik Andersen



Frederik Andersen has been one of the most consistent goaltenders of the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs, propelling the Carolina Hurricanes to the Eastern Conference Final for the third time in six seasons. With a .937 save percentage and elite underlying numbers, Andersen's play has transcended the eye test, supported by NHL EDGE stats that tell us his worthiness during critical moments.Frederik Andersen hasn't only been winning games—he's been dominating critical statistical categories. With seven victories in nine games and one shutout, his .937 save percentage tops all NHL goaltenders this playoffs. More remarkably, he's beaten expectations in high-danger situations and particular types of shots, solidifying himself as a potential Conn Smythe Trophy candidate.At 35 now, Frederik Andersen's playoff excellence has been essential for a Carolina Hurricanes team that prides itself on structure and possession—but has more than once depended heavily on their netminder when games have turned.NHL EDGE IQ says Frederik Andersen has been the NHL's top goalie in high-pressure shooting areas. He stopped 30 of 31 high-danger shots over five games against the Washington Capitals and holds the top mark among playoff goaltenders with a .923 high-danger save percentage that's an active league-wide mark.His consistency has been noteworthy too—Andersen has recorded a .900+ save percentage in seven of nine playoff games, with the highest rate among the other goaltenders remaining at 77.8% in that category.Though the Carolina Hurricanes' puck-possession system complements their goalie, Frederik Andersen's personal contribution cannot be overlooked. He paces all goaltenders in the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs at a +15 goal differential.Regardless of five other postseason goalies receiving equal or greater amounts of offensive support—including the Edmonton Oilers' Calvin Pickard and ousted netminders Jordan Binnington and Adin Hill—Andersen has posted results above the team structure.The Hurricanes' general excellence across key puck control statistics—46.6% zone time offensive and 58.4% in 5-on-5 attempts—has assisted in containing opponent pressure. But when challenged, Andersen has met the challenge.Where Andersen really stands out is in his play on shots created by extended possession zone play. According to NHL EDGE IQ, Andersen is the best qualified playoff goaltender, with a .968 save percentage on shots created from possession zone cycles—far above the .900 threshold.Since arriving with the Carolina Hurricanes in the 2021–22 season, he has performed reliably when healthy—100 total victories, 10 shutouts, and a .915 save percentage in the regular season and playoffs.Also read: How Frederik Andersen’s quiet confidence is powering the Hurricanes through playoffs?

Ryan Chesley’s signing signals new beginning for Washington’s defense



Chesley’s experience and pro debut highlight Capitals’ defensive future



The Washington Capitals have taken a significant step toward strengthening their defensive future by signing rising star Ryan Chesley to a three-year entry-level contract. With the 2025-26 season marking the start of his NHL journey, Capitals fans and hockey analysts alike are watching closely to see if Chesley can develop into the reliable, shutdown defenseman the franchise desperately needs. This move reflects Washington’s commitment to investing in young talent as they look to balance a competitive roster with long-term potential.Selected 37th overall in the 2022 NHL Draft, Ryan Chesley has steadily built an impressive and well-rounded resume through his collegiate career at the University of Minnesota and his early professional exposure with the Hershey Bears in the American Hockey League (AHL). The 21-year-old defenseman’s newly signed three-year contract carries an average annual NHL salary of $923,333, along with a corresponding AHL salary, clearly signaling the Capitals’ strong belief in his future potential and impact on their roster.Chesley’s development at Minnesota showcased his versatile two-way ability — consistently contributing 38 points while maintaining a strong defensive presence, reflected in a remarkable plus-minus rating of +34 over 115 NCAA games. Notably, he excelled in blocked shots and took on key leadership roles, qualities that NHL teams highly value in young defensemen striving to make the leap to the professional level.Adding to his credentials, Chesley’s international experience further enhances his profile, having represented the United States twice at the prestigious IIHF World Junior Championships . He earned a gold medal in 2024 while serving as an alternate captain and logging heavy minutes against some of the best young talent in the world.Also Read: No love like a Mother’s: Jane Gaudreau remembers late son Johnny Gaudreau in an emotional tweet that breaks internet While his full transition to the pro level is just beginning, Chesley’s promising performance with the Hershey Bears — recording points early in his AHL stint — shows clear potential that he could soon become a vital contributor on Washington’s blue line. As the Capitals look to bolster their defense and strategically prepare for future challenges, Ryan Chesley’s signing might very well prove to be a pivotal move in the organization’s ongoing rebuild and quest for sustained playoff success.","The Washington Capitals have signed rising star Ryan Chesley to a three-year entry-level contract.

Explicit messages revealed by Sharpe's team allegedly predate the alleged assault

Shannon Sharpe 's legal team released explicit text messages and named his accuser in a $50 million rape lawsuit , claiming the messages show a consensual sexual relationship initiated by her. The accuser's lawyer argues the texts predate the alleged assault and are a distraction.Shannon Sharpe’s legal team has released explicit text messages and publicly identified his accuser in a $50 million civil rape lawsuit, claiming the messages show a consensual relationship initiated by the woman. The accuser’s attorney, Tony Buzbee , argues the texts predate the alleged assault and are meant to distract from the core allegations.Sharpe, the NFL Hall of Famer , ""categorically denies"" the allegations, which stem from incidents allegedly occurring in late 2024 and early 2025. The lawsuit describes a two-year relationship marked by manipulation and abuse, including threats that Sharpe would ""brutally choke her and violently slap her.""Sharpe’s attorney, Lanny J. Davis, asserts that the extensive text messages reveal a mutually consensual, sexually explicit relationship. Messages allegedly sent by the accuser include graphic BDSM fantasies and offers of sexual acts. One message reportedly asked Sharpe to ""put a dog collar around my neck"" and to ""tie me up and do bad things to me."" In another, she allegedly offered ""$25,000 per cheek,"" referencing her body.The defense also cited messages involving sexual roleplay, references to breeding kinks, and desires for pregnancy, such as ""I want you to put that baby gravy in me"" and ""I’ve always wanted a Black baby."" Davis claims these texts show the accuser initiated and enjoyed the sexual nature of the relationship.The texts, according to Davis, spanned the relationship up until January 2, 2025, when Sharpe claims the relationship ended. Sharpe’s team maintains that the pair met in 2023 when the accuser was 20 years old.Tensions reportedly escalated after a September 2024 incident in which Sharpe was allegedly heard having sex on Instagram Live. Later texts from December show the accuser demanding a “formal apology,” to which Sharpe responded, “I’ve already apologized. Stop playing childish [games].”Buzbee firmly rejected the release of the texts as legally irrelevant, emphasizing that they occurred before the alleged rape. “Every text released today by Mr. Sharpe’s counsel predates the brutal assault detailed in Jane Doe’s case,” Buzbee stated. “It’s a deliberate distraction. It won’t work.”Also Read: Dak Prescott’s future with the Cowboys in jeopardy as brutal 2025 schedule could mark the end of an era in Dallas The outcome of the lawsuit may hinge on the timeline and context of these messages and whether they undermine the accuser’s claim of non-consensual conduct.

R Praggnanandhaa won the Superbet Chess Classic Romania 2025 , claiming his first Grand Chess Tour victory. He took home $77,667 and 10 GCT points following the title triumph.The journey, though, was far from easy. He drew his final classical game against Levon Aronian , but two of his rivals managed to win on demand. Maxime Vachier-Lagrave defeated Jan-Krzysztof Duda, while Alireza Firouzja, from a worse position, outmaneuvered Bogdan-Daniel Deac in a King’s Indian Defense.Ultimately, Praggnanandhaa beat Vachier-Lagrave in blitz playoffs to secure the title.Vachier-Lagrave and Firouzja both won their last-round games, tying for first before the tiebreaks. After three blitz games, Praggnanandhaa emerged victorious. He received an extra $10,000 bonus for finishing ahead of the other two players tied for first.This was the third playoff in five years at the Grand Chess Tour.Because the award ceremony had to happen on the same day, Technical Director Tony Rich explained that tiebreaks were expedited. With three players involved, a single round-robin blitz was played — no rapid games.After three games, no winner was decided, and the final decisive game was Praggnanandhaa vs. Vachier-Lagrave. What started as a seemingly drawn heavy-piece endgame suddenly became a tactical scramble.At the award ceremony, Praggnanandhaa remarked, ""I didn't do so well last time. Resting for a few hours before the tiebreak definitely helped,"" referencing his earlier early draw with Aronian and subsequent rest in his hotel.His victory earns him nine rating points, keeping him at No. 7 in the world rankings.The next Grand Chess Tour event is the 2025 SuperUnited Rapid & Blitz Croatia, scheduled for July 1-6.","R Praggnanandhaa won the Superbet Chess Classic Romania 2025.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Paige Bueckers' dad, Bob Bueckers, gives emotional response as his daughter makes WNBA debut

Paige Bueckers stepped onto the hardwood for her WNBA debut with the Dallas Wings . But while the former UConn star began a new chapter in her basketball journey, it was her father, Bob Bueckers , who stole hearts courtside. His heartfelt emotion was visible in his eyes as he watched his daughter live out the dream she’s nurtured since childhood.Paige Bueckers, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 WNBA Draft, took the floor at College Park Center in Arlington, Texas, facing the Minnesota Lynx . A home-state heroine making her professional debut against her childhood team, in front of a sold-out crowd, with her proud father just feet away— made her debut eventful.And her father Bob Bueckers didn’t hide a thing.“I’m very proud of her. But also just happy for her,” Bob told ION during an emotional sideline interview. “She’s living out her childhood dream right now. And to have her first game playing her hometown of the Lynx, who she grew up idolizing, is just surreal and I'm just so thankful for this.”As the national broadcast showed him holding back tears, Bob added with a trembling voice, “Yeah, I started crying during warm-ups, I think. It’s something she’s dreamt about her whole life.”Paige, meanwhile, embraced the pressure with poise. Though the Wings fell 99-84 to the Lynx, Bueckers notched 10 points, seven rebounds, and two assists in her first pro game. Her first bucket came from a determined putback after a missed runner, and her first assist set up a DiJonai Carrington three-pointer that briefly gave Dallas the lead.The emotional weight of the matchup was high but Bueckers clarified that she was focused on business, “It’s a full circle moment for sure, but at the end of the day, it's just the opponent on the other side of the floor at this point,” she told reporters postgame.The Wings, who view Bueckers as the future face of the franchise, saw enough to be hopeful despite the loss. She played meaningful minutes against a seasoned Lynx squad led by Napheesa Collier, who poured in 34 points and reminded the league why Minnesota is still a powerhouse.Also Read: Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert splits from pregnant partner Julia Bonilla, reportedly kicks her out But while the stat sheet offered a mixed debut, the story of the night wasn’t about numbers.
