Cody Rhodes has been a part of the WWE family since 2007. One could say that he’s been a part of it his whole life, given that Rhodes is a second-generation boxer. Throughout the years, the 39-year-old has won multiple Championships and still reigns as the undisputed WWE Champion.This year at MITB Rhodes will be teaming up with Randy Orton and Kevin Owens to take on the Bloodline , who are now being led by Solo Sikoa.The long-standing issues between these groups of stars have the potential to make this one of the best matches of the night. Before we get to witness Rhodes’ sixth MITB appearance, let’s take a look at how he’s fared throughout the years.Cody Rhodes made his first-ever MITB appearance back in 2010. He featured alongside the likes of Kane, Big Show, Randy Orton, The Miz, Jeff Hardy, Chris Jericho, and more. Rhodes was the first to set up a ladder and try to get his hands on the briefcase. However, Kane and Big Show, the big men in the ring, quickly put him out of commission. He took his revenge on Big Show by helping the other competitors take him out.Rhodes even managed a beautiful disaster on Kane. Rhodes even took out Big Show all by himself at one point by hitting him with a Ladder. More than once, Cody got his hands on the suitcase. However, he was chased up the ramp by Kane and slammed into an ambulance. That was the last we saw of Rhodes at Money in the Bank 2010.Cody Rhodes got a second shot at the contract just a year after his loss in 2011. He faced off against. Daniel Bryan, Heath Slater, Justin Gabriel, Kane, Sheamus, Sin Cara, and Wade Barrett. Rhodes was brilliant throughout the fight, landing plenty of acrobatic moves on his fellow stars. However, he took a beating so hard that he couldn’t even make one final push for the contract.In the end, Daniel Bryan and Wade Barrett were the only men left standing. Bryan hit Barrett with a kick to the face and lifted the coveted briefcase. This marked Cody Rhodes’ second loss at Money in the Bank.His appearance at MITB 2012 made it three years in a row where Cody Rhodes failed to get his hands on the coveted briefcase. Rhodes defeated Christian about 12 days before the PLE to earn himself a place in the MITB match. He faced off against Dolph Ziggler, Christian, Damien Sandow, Santino Marella, Sin Cara, Tensai, and Tyson Kidd.Unfortunately, this just wasn’t the night for Cody. He was resilient throughout and kept going after the belt even after taking a heavy beating. In the end, Dolph Ziggler caught a lucky break and was able to snatch the contract away from the other competitors.2013 marked Cody Rhodes’ fourth consecutive appearance at Money in the Bank. This year, he was one of the favorites to win as he went up against a cast of Dean Ambrose, Jack Swagger, Antonio Cesaro, Fandango, Wade Barrett, and Damien Sandow. However, something that nobody saw occurred during the closing moments of the match.Rhodes was moments away from taking the briefcase and riding off into the sunset. He could’ve finally ended his MITB losing streak. However, Damien Sandow got up at the worst possible time and pushed his former Tag Team partner, Cody Rhodes, off the ladder, which put him out of commission. After betraying Rhodes, Sandow took the briefcase for himself and thus began the bitter rivalry between the two stars.After four years of losing back-to-back MITB ladder matches, Cody Rhodes finally managed to get his first win at MITB 2014. Unfortunately, Rhodes wasn’t himself and made his appearance disguised as Stardust, the tag team partner to Goldust. Also, Cody wasn’t part of the Money in the Bank match and instead made a Tag Team appearance against Curtis Axle and Ryback.The brothers secured victory by pinfall and this marked Rhodes’ first win at MITB. A decade later, he will be returning to the PLE to face off against the Bloodline. Does Rhodes have another win in store for his fans, or will his MITB record continue to get worse?",Cody Rhodes has been a part of the WWE family since 2007. The 39-year-old has won multiple Championships and still reigns as the undisputed WWE Champion.

Bret Hart BLASTS Shawn Michaels Over Scrapped WrestleMania Plans!

Bret Hart On ACCIDENTALLY Disrespecting Shawn Michaels!

Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels are undeniably legends in the world of professional wrestling, each boasting remarkable and storied careers. However, for many fans, their legacies are overshadowed by a single controversial event: the infamous "" Montreal Screwjob ."" This moment from Survivor Series 1997 remains a dark spot in wrestling history, and even now, it’s a subject of much discussion and debate.On the podcast ""Six Feet Under,"" The Undertaker opened up about his feelings regarding this incident. Having witnessed the events unfold firsthand, he shared his sense of regret and disappointment over how the situation played out. ""It's just one of those really unfortunate situations,"" The Undertaker remarked. ""Both Shawn and Bret had incredible, stellar careers. They achieved so much, and yet this one political maneuver is what people often remember. It's great for fans to debate and discuss, but I genuinely feel bad for Shawn and Bret.""The Montreal Screwjob was a pivotal moment where Bret Hart was deceitfully stripped of the WWE Championship by Shawn Michaels, under the orchestration of Vince McMahon. This betrayal left Hart deeply embittered for many years. McMahon later made efforts to reconcile with Hart, starting with a phone call after Hart suffered a stroke and followed by Hart’s induction into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2006. Eventually, Hart and Michaels reconciled when Hart returned to WWE in 2010, setting the stage for a WrestleMania storyline. Hart even managed to make peace with Earl Hebner, the referee who had been involved in the controversial match and aware of the plan.Reflecting on his relationships with both Hart and Michaels, The Undertaker expressed his admiration and affection for the two. ""I'm friends with both Shawn and Bret. I think the world of those guys,"" he said. ""I'm really glad that everyone has moved on to a better place now. But it really sucked that it had to happen in the first place.""Co-host Matt Lyda noted how the ""Montreal Screwjob"" affected Hart’s subsequent tenure in WCW, observing a noticeable lack of enthusiasm in Hart’s performances. The Undertaker concurred, acknowledging the challenges of staying motivated in such circumstances. ""If he doesn’t get hurt, you never know what could have happened,"" The Undertaker mused. ""But when your heart's not in it, it’s tough. It’s really tough, man.""In the end, while the Montreal Screwjob remains a heavily debated topic among wrestling fans, it’s clear that for those involved, it’s a painful memory of what could have been. The Undertaker’s reflections underscore the emotional toll such events can take on the wrestlers, despite their many achievements and contributions to the sport.","Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels are undeniably legends in the world of professional wrestling.

The WWE Money in the Bank 2024 is almost here, and the upcoming PLE has some amazing match cards. The last few weeks of Raw and Smackdown zeroed in on all the contenders who will be participating at the mega show in Toronto. Not only is the current match-card exciting, but it could witness some of the most unpredictable finishes.Here are all the matches that are going to take place on Saturday in Toronto.If this match happened before what The Bloodline did with Paul Heyman, Cody Rhodes and company would have been the likely winners. However, the new members of The Bloodline are on the rise, and nothing but a victory will help Sikoa establish himself as the true leader. Whether The Rock and Roman Reigns return remains to be seen, but this match could be the first step of The Bloodline establishing themselves as a dominant force.Damian Priest has defended the World Heavyweight Championship well, but Seth Rollins has a different personality. The gentleman’s agreement makes things a bit more interesting. While Rollins could be the winner of the match (which means Priest will have to leave Judgement Day), he might not immediately get the title. In fact, a triple threat showdown could be set up for Summerslam 2024, where the duo faces the Ring General Gunther.Bron Breakker’s ascent in Raw has been rapid, to say the least, which is exactly why he might not win the title. Sami Zayn has won championships and fights where he has been the underdog, and Breakker loves to dominate his matches. While Zayn might turn out to be the winner in this championship fight, Breakker could establish himself as a strong threat to the entire RAW roster.Drew McIntyre is a strong contender to win, but a heel getting hold of the MITB might not be on the cards. Additionally, it looks almost certain that CM Punk will have some interference as he did in Scotland. In that case, Jey Uso appearsis the most obvious winner, as the MITB contract will allow him to push for any title he wants. However, Carmelo Hayes has received a lot of push from Triple H, and it won’t be surprising if the former NXT star manages to get an unexpected win.Unlike the men’s match, the women’s showdown has fewer legitimate contenders, and Tiffany appears to be the favorite. Like Hayes, Stratton has been receiving a strong push, and she becomes a great contender for a future title run by securing the MITB contract. However, Zoey Stark might also be a contender for the win if the creative division decides to give her the much-deserved push.","The WWE Money in the Bank 2024 is almost here, and the upcoming PLE has some amazing match cards.

Zimbabwe

captain talks to TOI on why India will move on quickly from the retirements of Kohli, Rohit and Jadeja in the shortest format...

Excerpts from an exclusive chat...

How do you see the next generation taking Indian cricket forward?

Who are the players from the India squad that you'll keep an eye on in Zimbabwe?

What are your expectations from Zimbabwe?

As the head coach of RCB, you've seen Virat Kohli from close quarters. Did you have an inkling he was going to retire from T20Is?

According to a survey, the T20 World Cup is gaining in popularity, even among players, and is on course to becoming the most important ICC event...

We had an IPL where 250-plus scores were achieved with regularity, and then the T20 World Cup where bowlers held sway...

(Watch India tour of Zimbabwe (5-match T20I series, July 7 onwards 4 PM IST) live on Sony Sports Ten 5 channels)

NEW DELHI: After their T20 World Cup triumph, India are back in action with a T20I series against a feisty Zimbabwe side. Nearly all the main team players have been rested from the India squad for this trip, while three heavyweights in Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja have retired from the format.Andy Flower , former Zimbabwe captain and current RCB head coach, spoke to TOI about what to expect from the five-game series.This India-Zimbabwe series is going to be really interesting. It's a very strong side the Indian selectors have put out. All these guys have not only shown a lot of talent in the IPL but also have the attitude required to play international cricket. There are readymade replacements for the guys who've retired, even though they are genuinely great cricketers. The strong domestic structure in India means there will always be readymade replacements. It's certainly nothing to be scared of. India will keep producing these greats. There is always someone ready to come in. Whenever some of the great cricketers have retired, you think they won't be and cannot be replaced. But people move on very quickly. All eyes adjust and focus on the next talent that comes along.If I put my IPL coaching hat on, then I'll have to keep a keen watch on the players. (Yashasvi) Jaiswal didn't play a single match in the T20 World Cup but he is an incredible option. Shubman Gill , by his standards, had a quiet IPL but he looks a very intelligent player. He plays in a similar way to Virat Kohli. I'm looking forward to Abhishek Sharma performing. I really like the look of Dhruv Jurel. Watching him in the Test series against England, he did brilliantly. Riyan Parag has the swagger that you need in international cricket.Their biggest player is Sikandar Raza even though he is 38 years old. He has been quite a late bloomer. I want to see how Blessing Muzarabani, a very tall, right-arm fast medium bowler, performs. Muzarabani with his bounce can trouble the Indian batters.I hadn't thought about it (Kohli's retirement). I was a little surprised. I really enjoyed working with Virat in the IPL last season. I have utmost respect for him, obviously as a player but also the way he supported Faf du Plessis and myself and Mo Bopat, the director of cricket. He is a brilliant role model. He is an outstanding professional sportsperson. He looks after himself really well. He is disciplined without being robotic. He laughs and has fun, has a cheeky sense of humour and takes the mickey out of people. He always mixes in with team gatherings and he is very approachable. He has a very good cricket brain and can think out of the box too.I'm surprised. I think the 50-over World Cup, because it's played every four years, holds more importance. I think there's a danger in playing a T20 World Cup every two years... it becomes commonplace. I wouldn't like anything called the 'World Cup' to be a commonplace. I like the rarity of a World Cup. But I also do feel that T20 World Cups help in growing the game globally. Two of the best stories to come out of the recent World Cup would be Afghanistan and the USA.The next IPL may see big scores again. I'm not sure what'll be done about the 'Impact Player' rule. It wasn't a favourite in the dressing room. The tempo and the power game is going to continue in the IPL. In the World Cup, some of the small scores were mainly due to the pitches on offer. The ICC will need to be careful about the surfaces that are being provided for marquee tournaments like the World Cup. In cricket, there should always be a healthy balance between the bat and ball.","Andy Flower, former Zimbabwe captain and current RCB head coach, spoke to TOI about what to expect from the five-game series.

They will face the Netherlands, who overcame Turkey in the other quarter-final match.The game in Duesseldorf was largely uneventful for the first 75 minutes until Breel Embolo gave Switzerland the lead by sliding in at the back post to convert Dan Ndoye 's deflected cross.However, England responded quickly, with Bukayo Saka scoring a fine goal from wide on the right, finding the far corner of the net to level the score just five minutes later.Despite a close call from substitute Xherdan Shaqiri, who hit the woodwork directly from a corner late in extra time, the match remained tied and proceeded to a penalty shootout.England converted all of their penalties, while Switzerland's Manuel Akanji was the only player to miss, with his attempt saved by Jordan Pickford.Cole Palmer, Jude Bellingham, Saka, Ivan Toney, and Trent Alexander-Arnold all scored their penalties to send England through to the semi-finals, helping to ease the pain of their shootout loss to Italy in the Euro 2020 final.""We are not going to stop fighting, we are in another semi-final and we'll see where we can get to,"" said Southgate, who marked the victory in his 100th game in charge with a dance in front of the England fans.""Every now and then you think surely there has to be some enjoyment in this job.

The Swiss team has managed to reach the quarter-finals on five separate occasions, encompassing both the World Cup and the European Championships.

The Dutch side secured their spot in the last four after overcoming a one-goal deficit to defeat Turkey 2-1 in Berlin during Saturday's other quarter-final match.Turkey took the lead in the first half when Samet Akaydin, who was filling in for the suspended Merih Demiral, headed in from Arda Guler's cross in the 35th minute.Demiral, Turkey's two-goal hero in their last-16 victory against Austria, was banned for this game due to making a controversial salute, which led to a diplomatic dispute between Turkey and Germany in the lead-up to the match at Berlin's Olympiastadion.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended the game, along with tens of thousands of supporters who greeted every prolonged Dutch possession with a chorus of whistles.Despite the hostile atmosphere, the Netherlands maintained their composure and found an equalizer 20 minutes from the end when Stefan de Vrij scored with a powerful header from Memphis Depay's cross.The Dutch then secured the victory six minutes later when Mert Muldur inadvertently turned a low Denzel Dumfries cross into his own net while under pressure from Cody Gakpo.This win was sufficient for the Netherlands, who last won the Euros in West Germany in 1988, to progress to their first semi-final at the tournament since 2004.""Tonight we had to dig very deep and I am proud of these guys,"" captain Virgil van Dijk told broadcaster NOS.""We want to fulfil our dream and we are one step closer.""Spain and France are set to face off in an exciting semi-final match in Munich on Tuesday.

1st T20I: Bowlers shine as unfancied Zimbabwe stun India by 13 runs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-zimbabwe/1st-t20i-bowlers-shine-as-unfancied-zimbabwe-stun-india-by-13-runs/articleshow/111541579.cms,"NEW DELHI: A spirited Zimbabwe stunned a youthful India by 13 runs in the series opener in Harare on Saturday, registering their first win against cricketing powerhouse in eight years.Pulling of an upset of gigantic proportions, minnows Zimbabwe, who had failed to qualify for the recently concluded T20 World Cup, handed India them first T20I defeat of the year.Despite restricting Zimbabwe to just 115 for nine, India was bowled out for 102 in 19.5 overs, thanks to a determined effort by the Zimbabwean bowlers, led by Tendai Chatara (3/16) and skipper Sikandar Raza (3/25).India, having recently won the T20 World Cup with a different squad, were expected to easily handle the Zimbabwean but failed to do so, folding for their fifth joint-lowest T20I total.India's bowlers, led by leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi (4/13), performed commendably on a pitch with some extra bounce and carry. Off-spinner Washington Sundar (2/11) also played a pivotal role as Zimbabwe struggled to build meaningful partnerships.Zimbabwe began their innings briskly, reaching 40 for two in the Powerplay. However, soon after that their batting frailties soon emerged.Following Kaia’s early dismissal, Wessly Madhevere (21 off 22 balls) and Brian Benett (22 off 15 balls) added 34 runs quickly before Benett was outfoxed by Bishnoi's googly. Bishnoi repeating the trick later claimed the wickets of Madhevere, Blessing Muzarabani, and Luke Jongwe, reducing Zimbabwe to 74 for three.Zimbabwe's middle and lower-order batters seemed to lose their way with their innings punctuated by runouts and soft dismissals. One such moment saw Jonathan Campbell, son of former Zimbabwe captain Alastair Campbell, involved in a mix-up that led to his dismissal. Campbell pushed an Avesh Khan delivery to the covers and set off for a single but changed his mind as his partner Dion Myers crossed the crease, eventually forcing Campbell to walk back.Despite the setbacks, Zimbabwe’s innings was buoyed by Clive Madande’s 29 not out off 25 balls, pushing their total past the 100-run mark. This resilient effort proved critical, as those extra runs became decisive.India's chase started poorly, faltering in the Powerplay itself. Abhishek Sharma , one of the three debutants alongside Riyan Parag and Dhruv Jurel , fell without scoring in the very first over. Sharma's cross-batted attempt off Brian Benett was caught in the outfield by Wellington Masakadza.Ruturaj Gaikwad (7) was next, succumbing to a slightly bouncier delivery from Blessing Muzarabani, which was edged to Innocent Kaia at first slip.Tendai Chatara then delivered a double blow, removing Parag (2) and Rinku Singh (0) within three balls in the fifth over. Parag’s attempt to loft over mid-off went to substitute Brandon Mavuta while Rinku Singh fell to a short-pitched delivery.Skipper Shubman Gill briefly steadied India with a sensible knock of 31 off 23 balls, including five boundaries.However, Raza soon disrupted his composure, bowling him out with a skidding delivery that breached Gill’s defense. With India at 84 for eight and soon 86 for nine, the chase seemed all but over.Avesh Khan (16 off 12) and Washington Sundar (27 off 34) added 23 runs for the eighth wicket, offering some hope, but Avesh's dismissal—caught by Raza at long-off off Wellington Masakadza’s full-toss—ended any prospects of recovery. India needed 16 runs in the final over, but could muster only two, as Zimbabwe celebrated a famous victory.Bishnoi’s career-best performance of 4/13 was a highlight for India’s bowling attack, which had otherwise managed to keep Zimbabwe largely under control.Bishnoi received significant support from Washington Sundar’s two wickets. Zimbabwe’s dissolution from a somewhat promising position of 74 for three to 115 for nine was primarily due to these two spinners, alongside the pace attack's contributions.The Indian team will need to regroup quickly with the second match of the series set for Sunday.The defeat calls for introspection, primarily concerning their batting approach under pressure. Despite the disappointment, the Indian bowlers showed promise and effectiveness, an area they would be keen to capitalize on in the upcoming clashes.","Zimbabwe stun India by 13 runs in T20 series opener in Harare.

Despite scoring 122 runs in four games, Azam has had to face severe criticism due to his moderate strike rate of just 101.66.Speaking to Cricket Pakistan, former Pakistani cricketer Mushtaq Ahmed drew a comparison between Indian cricket stalwart Virat Kohli and Azam while defending the latter's batting approach.He said, ""That (taking time) is his strength. Virat Kohli bhi time leta hai, woh konsa time nahi leta (Virat Kohli also takes time, he is also the same). If you put aside the last two or three matches, Rohit Sharma was scoring 20-25 runs. But I have seen a change of intent in Babar's game. He has become more aggressive.""If a person can improve so much, I think that's enough. Other players also have a duty to score runs; they have a role to play too. If one person gives you a score, but the rest of our players don't go on to score in the remaining 7-8 overs, then there's a problem. This has been happening for 3-4 years.
