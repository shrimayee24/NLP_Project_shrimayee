Sidhu’s predicted India XI:

Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant, Karun Nair, Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Anshul Kamboj.

NEW DELHI: As India gear up for a must-win fourth Test against England at Old Trafford, former cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu has weighed in with his predicted playing XI, calling for Sai Sudharsan’s return and expressing doubts over Karun Nair’s place in the side.With India trailing 1-2 in the five-match Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, the team’s selection decisions ahead of Wednesday’s Test have become a major talking point — particularly in light of Nitish Reddy’s injury and doubts over pacers Akash Deep and Arshdeep Singh.On his YouTube channel, Sidhu endorsed a lineup that included Sudharsan, dropped after a modest debut (0 and 30) in the first Test, and left out since.“Karun Nair is a promising cricketer, but his technical weakness has been exposed,” said Sidhu. “When you think of winning, I ask — what is the fault of Sai Sudharsan?”He hailed Sudharsan’s recent domestic and IPL form, saying, “You have one of the most promising players in India. He’s technically sound — low gravity, hand-eye coordination, and head over toe. Why shouldn’t he be in the team?”He also showered praise on Mohammed Siraj, calling him the unsung hero of India’s pace unit: “Siraj has bowled over 900 overs since 2020.He’s played 25 out of 27 overseas games. Controlled pace in England is key — and Siraj brings that in abundance.”Meanwhile, skipper Shubman Gill backed Nair, saying: “He didn’t bat at his number in the first game. We’ve had conversations with him, and he will turn it around.”With the series on the line and India’s middle order under the scanner, the final XI remains to be seen.",Former cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu predicts India XI for fourth Test against England.

“Get paid soon”: CeeDee Lamb pressures Jerry Jones as $45M Micah Parsons standoff shakes Cowboys camp,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/get-paid-soon-ceedee-lamb-pressures-jerry-jones-as-45m-micah-parsons-standoff-shakes-cowboys-camp/articleshow/122871126.cms,"CeeDee Lamb backs Micah Parsons $45M payday (Image credits: IG/X)

CeeDee puts heat on Jerry Jones as locker room rallies behind Parsons

Micah reports to camp, but contract clock still ticking

Market pressure mounts on Cowboys

FAQs

Q1. What is Micah Parsons’ contract status?

Q2. What are his career highlights so far?

Q3. How much could Parsons earn on his next deal?

Micah Parsons remains unsigned as the Cowboys enter training camp, and now one of the team’s biggest stars is breaking silence. Wide receiver CeeDee Lamb has stepped in, sending a clear signal to Jerry Jones and the Dallas front office — it’s time to pay up. With public pressure rising and the locker room watching, Lamb’s voice may just tilt the scales in this high-stakes contract standoff.For the first time since talks stalled, Lamb openly addressed the tension around Parsons’ extension. Speaking candidly, he remarked, “Playing this media game with Jerry [Jones] is not the best. It’s not fun. It’s not recommended.”His remarks add urgency inside the locker room, where players are rallying around Parsons as camp heats up. Lamb’s tone wasn’t confrontational — it was calculated. And it emphasized just how important Parsons is to the team’s long-term plans.Despite reporting to camp in Oxnard, Parsons is taking part in limited on-field activity while contract talks remain frozen. On Tuesday, he confirmed that there’s “not really much movement” on the deal — and that his attendance is for himself and his teammates, not a tactic.The 25-year-old linebacker added pointedly: “They sign the checks… let’s see if they want me to be here at the end of the day.”The message is clear: he’s ready to deliver, but not at a discount.Across the league, defensive stars are getting paid. With Myles Garrett, T.J. Watt, and Nick Bosa all earning deals in the $30–40 million range, analysts expect Parsons — a two-time First-Team All-Pro — to command at least $45 million annually.Lamb, fully aware of Parsons’ worth, reinforced the call: “Micah knows what he brings to the table… he should get what he deserves. I do want Micah to get paid, soon.” With media scrutiny intensifying and fan frustration boiling online, the Cowboys are walking a tightrope — and Lamb just turned up the heat on Jones to close the deal.Also read: Chris Broussard slams Jerry Jones as Micah Parsons’ $40M NFL contract talks stall Parsons is playing on his fifth-year rookie option worth around $24 million.

Bryce Harper launches career milestone home run as Phillies take on Red Sox in high-octane showdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/bryce-harper-launches-career-milestone-home-run-as-phillies-take-on-red-sox-in-interleague-showdown/articleshow/122871121.cms,"Bryce Harper.

Bryce Harper’s milestone shot ignited Phillies’ early lead



Bryce Harper delivered at the right time



FAQs

Q: How far did Bryce Harper’s 350th home run travel?



Q: How many active players have hit 350 or more home runs?



Q: What makes Harper’s milestone unique?



Philadelphia Phillies star Bryce Harper added another historic milestone to his already decorated career Wednesday night, becoming the youngest active MLB player to reach 350 career home runs. The blast, a jaw-dropping 439-foot rocket into the right-field stands, came in the first inning of a high-energy matchup against the Boston Red Sox at Citizens Bank Park— and had both fans and stat-watchers cheer for the star.It didn’t take long for Harper to make his mark. Facing Red Sox right-hander Lucas Giolito, the 32-year-old slugger jumped on a first-pitch fastball and launched it with authority.The ball exploded off his bat at 110.8 mph and cleared the fence with ease. Not only did the blast set a personal best for the year, but it also etched Harper into an exclusive group of just eight active players to reach the 350-homer plateau.Among those in the 350+ club: Giancarlo Stanton (434), Mike Trout (395), Paul Goldschmidt (370), Manny Machado (360), Freddie Freeman (353), Nolan Arenado (351), and Aaron Judge (351). What sets Harper apart is his age— at 32, he’s the youngest active player on the list.The home run wasn’t just a career moment. It was also a key part of the Phillies’ explosive start. Kyle Schwarber set the tone earlier in the inning with a 409-foot two-run homer that scored Trea Turner. Harper followed up with his solo shot to give Philadelphia a quick 3–0 lead and leave the Red Sox reeling.Harper’s milestone comes during a scorching hot stretch. After returning from nearly a month on the injured list due to right wrist inflammation, the former MVP has been tearing up opposing pitchers. Heading into Wednesday, he was batting .429 (15-for-35) with nine doubles, four homers, seven RBIs, and a stunning 1.529 OPS over his last nine games.The timing of Harper’s resurgence couldn’t be better for the Phillies, who are eyeing a strong second-half push. And if Schwarber continues slugging alongside him, he now has 34 homers on the season; the duo could carry serious October implications.Also Read: Minnesota Vikings legend Adrian Peterson shares training video ahead of boxing match against nemesis Baby Joe A: It went 439 feet with an exit velocity of 110.8 mph.A: Bryce Harper is now one of eight active players to reach that mark.A: At 32, he’s the youngest active MLB player to hit 350 career home runs.",Bryce Harper is the youngest active MLB player to reach 350 career home runs.

WNBA player fined after lip-syncing Sabrina Carpenter’s “Manchild” to roast referees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/wnba-player-fined-after-lip-syncing-sabrina-carpenters-manchild-to-roast-referees/articleshow/122871660.cms,"Sabrina Carpenter and Sophie Cunningham.

Which WNBA player used Sabrina Carpenter’s song to mock officials on TikTok?



Sophie Cunningham came to the defense of her teammate recently

FAQs:



What did Sophie Cunningham post about WNBA referees ?



How much was Sophie Cunningham fined?



Was Sophie Cunningham also involved in another altercation recently?



Women's basketball has its own share of controversies and issues outside the court. Recently, a new one came to light involving a top WNBA player who expressed her issues with the league’s officiating. This came at the expense of the song of music icon, Sabrina Carpenter , which became a catalyst for her voice against the NBA referees on the social media platform, TikTok.In a recent video uploaded on her TikTok, Indiana Fever player Sophie Cunningham decided to fire shots at the WNBA officials. She lip-synced Sabrina Carpenter’s popular song, ‘Manchild’, particularly at some specific lyrics, ""Stupid, or is it slow, or is it useless.""In the video, she sang and tagged ‘some refs’ in the caption.Later on, in a tweet via her official X account, Cunningham revealed that she had been fined $500 by the WNBA for her TikTok shenanigans. She wrote, “I got fined $500 for this TikTok 🤣🤣 idk why this is funny to me… like ok 👍🏼 you got it bud! Cause there’s not more important things to be worried about with our league right now.”This has led to a debate regarding player’s freedom of expression of their grievances against the league.While the incident drew major attention, Cunningham, so far, has been let go with a fine and not other severe consequences, even though her actions were directed straight towards the working of the WNBA.Sophie Cunningham has been seen as an outspoken player who is not afraid to voice their opinion. The woman, who has come to be known as ‘The Enforcer’ of the Fever, recently came to the defense of her teammate and one of the WNBA’s biggest names, Caitlin Clark.She had been a target for many of her opponents on the court. On numerous occasions, she faced rough treatment, especially in the early weeks of her second season. This also included a run-in with her nemesis, Jacy Sheldon.She apparently poked Clark in the eye in the third quarter, and Marina Mabrey shoved her to the floor. This led to Sophie coming for some payback by wrapping Sheldon’s neck and dragging her to the ground just as she was going for a basket in the final moments of the match between the Indiana Fever and Connecticut Sun.With Indiana cruising to a win, Sheldon was driving to the basket in the final minute when the Fever's newest enforcer wrapped her up around her neck area and dragged her down to the ground. While Cunningham faced ejection from the game and fines, it can be said that she is not willing to back down from injustice or mistreatment in the WNBA.Also read : NBA Trade News: Detroit Pistons Nab Emerging $2.2 Million Oklahoma City Thunder Wing on Two-Way Contract Sophie Cunningham lip-synced Sabrina Carpenter’s song ‘Manchild’ and called WNBA referees, ""Stupid, or is it slow, or is it useless.""The Indiana Fever Enforcer was fined $500 for her actions.Sophie Cunningham dragged Jacy Sheldon down to the ground during a recent game between the Indiana Fever and Connecticut Sun, for which she was ejected and fined.",Sophie Cunningham posted a video on TikTok mocking WNBA referees.

Travis Hunter’s father arrested again just months after NFL Draft moment with son — here’s what happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-hunters-father-arrested-again-just-months-after-nfl-draft-moment-with-son-heres-what-happened/articleshow/122867067.cms,"(Image via Imagn Images)

Travis Hunter Sr. was arrested for a probation violation involving his ankle monitor



Travis Jr. previously dedicated his Heisman moment to his father’s sacrifice



“Dad, I love you.

For all the stuff you went through … I did it for you.”

What happens now? Hearing scheduled as legal pressure builds

FAQs:

1. What was Travis Hunter Sr. originally convicted for?

2. Is Travis Hunter Jr. involved in his father’s legal troubles?

3. Will Travis Hunter’s father go to prison again?

Just when things were looking up for Travis Hunter Jr., life threw another tough twist his way. The Jacksonville Jaguars rookie, fresh off a Heisman-winning college career and a celebrated NFL Draft moment with his dad by his side, is now dealing with a painful headline, his father, Travis Hunter Sr. , has been arrested once again. The reason? A minor but serious probation violation that’s sparked a wave of sympathy, criticism, and emotional reflection online.The details behind the arrest feel both technical and tragic. On June 28, Hunter Sr.’s electronic ankle monitor allegedly lost signal for just 11 minutes. But when questioned, his explanation didn’t hold up, first saying he was in a different room, then later claiming he misplaced the device. Authorities didn't accept either story, and a warrant for his arrest was issued on July 10.By July 22, he was taken into custody in Palm Beach County, Florida, and is now being held without bond until his next court appearance. He’s being accused of violating probation terms tied to a 2023 conviction, which stemmed from a traffic stop that involved a loaded gun and narcotics.This isn’t just another headline about an athlete’s family drama, this one stings because we’ve seen the love between them. During the 2024 Heisman Trophy ceremony, Travis Jr. gave his dad a heartfelt shoutout:Hunter Sr. wasn’t allowed to attend that moment due to home confinement, but he did make it to the 2025 NFL Draft after a judge granted special permission. Photos from that day showed a proud father standing tall beside his son, something fans celebrated at the time. Now, that image feels bittersweet.Hunter Sr. is currently in jail, and a probation violation hearing is scheduled later this week. If a judge rules against him, he could face revocation of probation, meaning he’d serve the remainder of his sentence in prison. There’s no word yet on whether his son has commented or will appear in court.Travis Hunter Jr. is gearing up for his rookie season with the Jaguars, but behind the on-field excitement, he’s carrying a personal weight that few can understand. While the arrest doesn’t involve him directly, it’s clear his family’s struggles continue to follow him even as he rises to NFL stardom.In 2023, he was arrested during a traffic stop where officers found a loaded firearm and narcotics. He pled guilty and was sentenced to 90 days in jail, followed by three years of probation and one year of house arrest.No, Travis Jr. is not involved in the case. He is currently focused on preparing for his rookie NFL season with the Jacksonville Jaguars.It’s possible. A hearing is scheduled this week to determine whether the probation violation will lead to additional jail time or revocation of probation.Also read - “This is why he beats him”: Fans roast Tyreek Hill after his son thinks Justin Jefferson is his real dad","Travis Hunter Sr. was arrested for a probation violation involving his ankle monitor.

The Lakers are expected to offer him a four-year extension in the range of $222 to $229 million, cementing their commitment to building around the 26-year-old superstar.Though Luka Doncic doesn’t qualify for a supermax deal due to his midseason acquisition, the expected contract would still place him among the NBA’s top earners—underscoring both his production and influence. Luka finished the 2024-25 season with averages of 28.2 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 7.7 assists, leading the Lakers to a third-place finish in a stacked Western Conference.In another strong offseason move, the Los Angeles Lakers added veteran guard Marcus Smart on a two-year, $11 million contract.

Two-Way Deal Offers Antonio Reeves a Crucial Development Opportunity

A Smart Low-Cost Move as Hornets Continue Rebuild

Thehave officially signed guardto a two-way NBA contract, taking a calculated gamble on a promising young scorer. First reported by ESPN’s Shams Charania, the move gives Charlotte another offensive weapon as they continue reshaping their roster.Antonio Reeves, 24, was selected 47th overall in the 2024 NBA Draft by the New Orleans Pelicans . He appeared in 44 games during his rookie year, averaging 6.9 points, 1.4 rebounds, and about 15 minutes per contest. What stood out most was his shooting efficiency: 45.6% from the field, 39.5% from beyond the arc, and 80% at the free-throw line.The former Kentucky standout also lit up the G League with the Birmingham Squadron, averaging nearly 25 points per game while showcasing strong rebounding and efficient shooting splits. His performance in both leagues has solidified his reputation as a dependable perimeter scorer.Despite his upside, the Pelicans waived Antonio Reeves earlier this offseason before his 2025-26 salary became guaranteed. Sources indicate the decision came from a new front office regime that had no direct ties to drafting him. That opened the door for the Hornets to swoop in and secure his services via a two-way deal.To make room, Charlotte is expected to release either KJ Simpson or Damion Baugh, with Baugh reportedly more likely to be waived following recent roster moves.The Charlotte Hornets continue to prioritize shooting and guard depth as part of their long-term rebuild. While some observers question adding another scoring guard to an already crowded backcourt, Antonio Reeves brings something valuable: elite catch-and-shoot potential. His near-40% three-point shooting aligns with Charlotte’s emphasis on spacing and perimeter offense.Given the franchise’s recent struggles, Reeves could emerge as a cost-effective scoring option, especially compared to past two-way signees. If his development continues, he may earn a more permanent NBA role sooner rather than later.Antonio Reeves’ collegiate success at Kentucky translated smoothly into professional play, and now the Hornets are betting on that trajectory continuing. While he’ll split time between the NBA and G League, Charlotte will likely explore ways to utilize his shooting spark off the bench.For Reeves, the two-way deal offers a fresh opportunity to prove himself, and for the Charlotte Hornets, it’s a low-risk move with considerable upside. As the 2025-26 season approaches, all eyes will be on how this talented young guard makes the most of his new environment.Also read: NBA Trade News: Detroit Pistons Nab Emerging $2.2 Million Oklahoma City Thunder Wing on Two-Way Contract To Perimeter Defense This signing also underscores how fluid NBA rosters can be in the offseason—and how two-way contracts continue to serve as vital pathways for rising talent to break into the league.

From Fringe Prospect to Valuable Rotation Contributor

Why the Detroit Pistons Made the Move

What Colby Jones Brings to the Table

Theare continuing to build around young, versatile talent by signing guard/forwardto a two-way contract, per ESPN. At just 23, Jones arrives with momentum after a breakout second-half performance last season that showcased his growing value as a reliable two-way player.A 2023 second-round pick (34th overall), the 6-foot-6 Colby Jones entered the league as a do-it-all swingman with positional flexibility. His rookie season with the Sacramento Kings was quiet—averaging just 2.1 points across 30 appearances. But a midseason trade in 2024 to the Washington Wizards became the turning point.Limited to just 1.1 points per game in brief early-season stints with the Kings, Colby Jones found his rhythm in Washington. Over a 15-game stretch with the Wizards, he impressed by putting up 8.7 points, 4.3 rebounds, 2.5 assists, and 1.3 steals per game, shooting 46.6% from the field. More importantly, he looked the part of a dependable role player—defending on the perimeter, making smart passes, and hitting timely shots.The Detroit Pistons ’ ongoing rebuild has emphasized acquiring high-IQ, positionless players who can defend and develop within a team structure. Jones fits that mold perfectly. Detroit’s decision to bring him in on a two-way contract gives them the flexibility to test his potential in both the NBA and G League without taking up a full roster spot.His combination of length, defensive instincts, and improving offensive feel makes him a valuable depth piece with upside. If he continues trending upward, the Detroit Pistons can convert his deal into a standard contract.- Defensive Versatility: Colby Jones’ lateral quickness and anticipation have made him a consistent presence on the defensive end, notching 1.3 steals per game with Washington.- Rebounding Ability: Averaging 4.3 boards per game as a wing shows his willingness to mix it up and contribute in all facets.- Playmaking Support: He’s shown flashes of facilitating offense, especially in transition and pick-and-roll scenarios, averaging 2.5 assists during his Wizards run.- Improved Efficiency: His 46.6% field-goal percentage and flashes of perimeter scoring (though his career 3PT mark remains low at .254) suggest progress.- Basketball IQ: Coaches praise his ability to read the game, stay within his role, and execute defensively.For the Detroit Pistons, Colby Jones is a low-risk, potentially high-reward addition. With limited pressure and an environment focused on player growth, Jones could carve out a bigger role than expected. He’s already shown he can adjust to different systems and contribute meaningfully.However, his inconsistency as a shooter and relatively modest offensive ceiling mean he’ll need to continue refining his game to stick long-term. His two-way status also limits his NBA availability unless the Detroit Pistons convert his contract.Also read: NBA Trade News: Phoenix Suns Reunite with $2.35 Million Los Angeles Lakers Star in Bold Waiver Steal to Bolster Championship Backcourt Still, Colby Jones brings the kind of competitive energy, intelligence, and versatility that rebuilding teams value.

What Jordan Goodwin Brings to the Table

Thehave made a calculated move by claiming guardoff waivers, reuniting with the high-energy player they previously included in the 2023 Bradley Beal trade. It’s a savvy, low-cost acquisition that bolsters the team’s defensive depth and adds familiarity to their evolving backcourt.Jordan Goodwin, the 26-year-old guard, has bounced between multiple teams over the last two seasons:- He began his NBA career with the Washington Wizards, later joined the Memphis Grizzlies, and landed in Phoenix in 2023 as part of the Beal deal.- Goodwin appeared in 40 games for the Phoenix Suns in the 2023-24 season before being traded to Memphis. He eventually signed a two-way deal with the Lakers in early 2025, which was later converted to a standard contract.- With the Lakers, he logged 29 appearances, averaging 5.6 points, 3.9 rebounds, and 1.4 assists in just under 19 minutes per game. He also shot a respectable 43.8% from the field and 38.2% from three—solid efficiency for a role player.Jordan Goodwin’s release from Los Angeles wasn’t a reflection of his performance, but rather the cost of roster management:- After signing Marcus Smart with their bi-annual exception, the Lakers were forced to dip below the first salary cap apron, which required trimming non-guaranteed contracts.- As a result, both Goodwin and Shake Milton were waived, even though Goodwin was a reliable presence off the bench in JJ Redick’s rotation.- Attempts to restructure the roster via trade fell through, leaving Jordan Goodwin as a cap casualty.Bringing Goodwin back wasn’t just sentimental—it was strategic:- His tenacious defense and team-first mentality are exactly what the Phoenix Suns have prioritized this offseason.- With a retooled backcourt featuring Devin Booker, Jalen Green , and Dillon Brooks, Goodwin provides insurance and hard-nosed depth.- His contract is extremely team-friendly—$2.35 million with only $25,000 guaranteed until January 2026—allowing Phoenix flexibility and low-risk upside.- Elite hustle and perimeter defense, helping fill a void that’s long hampered the Phoenix Suns’ title aspirations.- Positional versatility, capable of switching between guard roles, disrupting opposing ball-handlers, and pushing the pace.- A blue-collar work ethic—diving for loose balls, fighting for rebounds, and never taking possessions off—that coaches and teammates consistently praise.Jordan Goodwin’s NBA story isn’t flashy—but it’s exactly what championship rosters need. In a league dominated by superstars, he stands out as a throwback grinder: underappreciated, undervalued, and always ready. His $25K guarantee until January adds drama: every game is a chance to earn a full-season role.Fans in Phoenix who value heart and hustle over highlights may find a new favorite in Goodwin. He won’t be the face of the franchise, but he just might be the glue.Also read: Jalen Green Breaks Silence on Houston Rockets - Phoenix Suns Trade: “I Get It, Bro” For the Phoenix Suns, this is more than a waiver wire pickup—it’s a culture play.

Oilers want more firepower: Isaac Howard 's arrival just the start of aggressive plans

Could Jordan Eberle come full circle?



FAQs



1. Why are the Edmonton Oilers focusing on offense this offseason?

2. Is Isaac Howard the Oilers’ final addition to the top six?

3. Could Jordan Eberle return to the Oilers?

As the Edmonton Oilers recalibrate after falling just short in the Stanley Cup Final, their front office seems far from content resting on laurels. While fans clamor for changes in goal and defense, the team’s brass appears laser-focused on stacking even more offensive talent around stars Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl — because in Edmonton, you can never have too many playmakers.While much of the hockey world points toward the Oilers’ goalie situation or defensive depth as urgent issues, the organization is quietly doubling down on what it already does best — scoring goals. The recent addition of Hobey Baker Award winner Isaac Howard, once seen as the big swing of the summer, now appears to be just the beginning.“The Oilers are looking for another top six guy,” insider David Pagnotta revealed on the Hello Hockey podcast. That search underscores a familiar trend: Edmonton’s consistent pursuit of elite forwards, often at the expense of more pressing needs in net or along the blue line.It’s a high-risk, high-reward strategy. Critics argue the team has fallen into a cycle — losing big, barely adjusting, and repeating history. In Alberta, where hockey passion runs deep, fans are hoping this time around ends differently.Among the names surfacing in trade speculation is a familiar face: Jordan Eberle.Drafted by the Oilers in 2008, Eberle spent seven seasons in Edmonton before moving on. At 35, he remains a savvy veteran with offensive instincts that could mesh well with the current core.“One possible option for Edmonton is a reunion with its 2008 first-round pick, Jordan Eberle,” Sporting News writer Sam Bernardi noted. “Should the Kraken, who do not appear destined for a playoff berth, feel like offloading Eberle and retaining salary for extra draft capital, Edmonton should be the first to call.”It’s a poetic possibility — a return of one of their own to chase unfinished business. But even as nostalgia brews, the question remains: Will this offensive push finally bring balance to the roster, or will it once again leave the Oilers vulnerable when it matters most?One thing’s clear — Edmonton isn’t done building. And with McDavid and Draisaitl in their prime, the window to strike is now.The Oilers are prioritizing offensive reinforcements around McDavid and Draisaitl, despite fans' concerns about goaltending and defense.No, reports suggest Edmonton is still exploring options to add another top-six forward alongside Howard.Yes, a potential reunion with Eberle is being discussed as the Kraken may offload him before the season ends.Also Read: NHL Trade Talk: Connor McDavid’s Oilers shift focus to Blackhawks after failed goalie trade with Canucks","The Edmonton Oilers are looking for another top-six forward.

India U-19’s rising star Vaibhav Suryavanshi endured a rare failure, getting dismissed for a golden duck on Day 4 of the second Youth Test against England U-19 at Chelmsford.The 14-year-old teen prodigy, who lit up the 2025 IPL season with Rajasthan Royals , faced a harsh reminder of Test cricket’s challenges when he mistimed an aggressive pull shot off the very first ball he faced from England’s Alex Green, chopping it onto his stumps.The early blow left India under pressure as they began their daunting chase of 355 runs on the final day.Suryavanshi’s dismissal at 0-1 was a setback, but the talented left-hander is known for his fearless batting style and is expected to bounce back stronger.Watch:Despite his failure, skipper Ayush Mhatre took charge of the chase with a blistering counterattack.Displaying remarkable composure and controlled aggression, Mhatre smashed 13 4s and six sixes to race to 126 runs, lifting India’s spirits and keeping the chase alive.Mhatre’s 126 off 80 balls at a staggering strike rate of 157.50 was the highlight of the innings, unsettling the English bowlers and injecting hope into an improbable chase.Meanwhile, Vihaan Malhotra and wicketkeeper-batter Abhigyan Kundu provided valuable support, rotating strike and ensuring the scoreboard kept ticking.While the road to victory remains steep, India’s fearless batting approach in the second innings stands out.Mhatre’s heroics, in particular, have caught attention, especially after his recent stint with Chennai Super Kings in the IPL.","India U-19’s rising star Vaibhav Suryavanshi endured a rare failure, getting dismissed for a golden duck on Day 4 of the second Youth Test against England.

Brief scores:

England U19:

India U19:

Ayush Mhatre’s blazing century nearly took India U19 to a memorable win, but bad light and rain intervened just as the visitors closed in on an epic chase in the second Youth Test against England, ending the match in a frustrating draw at Wormsley on Wednesday.Set a stiff target of 355 in 65 overs, India made an audacious push, led by Mhatre’s scintillating 126 off just 80 balls, studded with 13 fours and 6 sixes. At 290 for six in 43 overs — just 65 runs away with 22 overs to go — India were well on course before rain halted proceedings with Harvansh Pangalia (29*) and Kanishk Chouhan (12*) at the crease. Play never resumed thereafter.India’s chase began on a jittery note, losing Vaibhav Suryavanshi to the very first ball. But Mhatre, in partnership with Vihaan Malhotra (27), added a brisk 100 off 13.4 overs. The momentum continued with a whirlwind 117-run stand between Mhatre and Abhigyan Kundu (65 off 46), pushing India to 217 for two in just 26.3 overs.Mhatre’s dismissal by left-arm spinner Ralphie Albert (4/76) sparked a mini-collapse, with India slipping to 263 for six.But the lower order held firm, until the weather had its say.Earlier, England’s second innings was built around BJ Dawkins (136) and Adam Thomas (91), whose 188-run stand powered the hosts to 324/5 declared. Aditya Rawat was India’s most successful bowler with 4 wickets.Though both Youth Tests ended in draws, India took the honours in the overall series with a 3-2 win in the one-dayers. But on a dramatic final day at Wormsley, it was Ayush Mhatre’s breathtaking hundred — and the rain — that stole the headlines.309 & 324/5 declared (BJ Dawkins 136, Adam Thomas 91; Aditya Rawat 4/80) drew with279 all out & 290/6 in 43 overs (Ayush Mhatre 126, Abhigyan Kundu 65; Ralphie Albert 4/76).","Ayush Mhatre scores 126 in India's second innings of 2nd Youth Test against England at Wormsley.

'He was in a lot of pain': Sai Sudharsan admits Rishabh Pant's absence could hurt India

India were left holding their breath on Wednesday as star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant hobbled off the field in visible agony after a painful blow to his right foot during Day 1 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford. Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting summed up the mood succinctly: “It doesn’t look good at all.”Pant, batting fluently on 37, attempted a reverse sweep off a yorker from Chris Woakes and inside-edged the ball onto his right boot. What followed was a worrying sequence — Pant took off his shoe, revealed a badly swollen foot, and was visibly unable to stand. He rolled on the turf in pain for several minutes before being taken off on a buggy.Ponting, speaking to Sky Sports, said the signs were ominous: ""He hardly put his foot on the ground. He rolled around for 6-8 minutes before the golf cart came out. The immediate swelling was the worry for me. I've had a metatarsal injury myself, and they're small, fragile bones. The fact he couldn't put any weight on it — it doesn't look good at all.""Pant’s absence could severely dent India’s chances, especially as they trail 1-2 in the five-match series.""The momentum he brings to the Indian team — that’s what they potentially miss the most,"" Ponting added.""Someone who can break the game open and put pressure back on the opposition.""India’s Sai Sudharsan, who top-scored with 61, said Pant “was in a lot of pain” and confirmed he had gone for scans. “We’ll get to know overnight,” he added.Former India coach Ravi Shastri echoed concerns about Pant’s absence shaping the course of the Test: ""If he cannot come back to bat, that can have a huge influence on this game. And with the second new ball due tomorrow, I think anything can happen.""Pant has been one of India’s standout performers this series, scoring 462 runs at an average of 77 — and now, the team waits anxiously for the verdict that could define their Manchester campaign.",Rishabh Pant hobbled off the field in visible agony after a blow to his right foot during Day 1 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford.

However, the 36-year-old is in terrific form with the bat and has scored 337 runs in the series, including four consecutive fifties.“I feel Jadeja, if he has even 40 per cent of the belief that Ben Stokes has, he will win you a lot more matches. Because there is no doubt about his talent,” Ravi Shastri said on the cricket podcast Stick To Cricket.“It’s just that he will have to go and take charge and believe in himself,” he added.Shastri emphasized that despite scoring three triple hundreds in first-class cricket, it took Jadeja a long time to realise his batting potential.“He has got three triple hundreds in first-class cricket. It took him ages to realise that he has that batting potential,” Shastri said.Speaking about the Lord’s Test, he added: “One of the great sights of this series was at the end of the Lord’s Test, when Stokes and Jadeja hugged each other. Two of the best all-rounders in the business at the moment.

Poll Is Shubman Gill's aggressive approach as captain beneficial for the Indian team? Absolutely, it shows leadership. No, it could backfire. It depends on the match situation.

On the eve of the fourth Test match of the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, Shubman Gill had questioned England's ""spirit of the game"" after their opener came late to the crease on Day 3 of the Lord's Test.""Yes, a lot of people have been talking about it, so let me just clear the air, once and for all. The English batsmen on that day had seven minutes of play left; they were 90 seconds late to come to the crease — not 10, not 20 — 90 seconds late,"" Gill had said.""Yes, most teams use this (delaying tactic); even if we were in a similar position, we would have also liked to play fewer overs. But there is a manner to do it, and we felt that if you get hit on your body, the physios are allowed to come on, and that is something that is fair.""But to be able to come 90 seconds late to the crease is not something that I would think comes under the spirit of the game,"" he added.On the opening day of the fourth Test match, while doing commentary, former England captain Nasser Hussain questioned Gill for his comments in the press conference, saying India would look to do a similar thing today and not want to face extra overs.Hussain was referring to India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja asking the on-field umpire about the lights. Dinesh Karthik immediately corrected Hussain without wasting any time and said: ""Gill said his issue was with England walking out after 90 seconds, not what they did during the over.""Dinesh Karthik also said he is loving Shubman Gill's approach to captaining India in the ongoing Test series against England and added that it’s fine to be feisty in order to establish a distinct identity as the side’s skipper.“I've really enjoyed him as a captain so far. On the field, I think he's improving, but off the field is where I've been most impressed. I think yesterday's press conference was absolutely box office — apparently, it just went quiet until the last question was asked about why things have gotten a bit spicy, and he said, 'Look, England went 90 seconds late and we don't appreciate that,' and I like it.”""It's good to be feisty. You need to have an identity as a captain, and Shubman Gill from that third day at Lord's has actually shown that he's got a lot more aggression inside him — and that's how he wants to lead this Indian team. Yes, the result didn't go his way, but the point is, it’s made for a thrilling Test series so far, and his captaincy is right at the forefront of it, backed by his batting skills as well,” said Karthik on Sky Sports’ broadcast.","Shubman Gill questioned England's ""spirit of the game"" after their opener came late to the crease on Day 3 of the Lord's Test.

Anshul Kamboj Joins India Nets After Nitish’s Injury | Debut Incoming at Manchester?

Poll Do you think Anshul Kamboj will make a significant impact in the Indian Test team? Yes, definitely Maybe, depends on performance No, unlikely

Behind the proud smile the 24-year-old Anshul Kamboj sported on Wednesday while receiving his Test cap at Old Trafford, there was a short but intense battle to get fit in time.Last Nov, when Kamboj took all 10 wickets in an innings against Kerala, he proudly told TOI that he had never been injured. It’s impossible for a sportsperson to stay away from injuries, however, and in June this year Kamboj had to fly back from England — after playing two matches for India ‘A’ — to treat a shin injury.The Indian Test team needed one pacer from the ‘A’ team as cover for Akash Deep. Kamboj’s ability to bowl long and accurate spells made him an obvious choice. The injury to Kamboj, however, meant Harshit Rana was asked to stay back instead.Kamboj, who cricketing journey started in Karnal in Haryana, was hurting. He headed straight to Haryana’s director of coaching Ashwini Kumar’s academy in Sultanpur, near Gurugram, for training and rehab. The Haryana Cricket Association’s (HCA) academy programme has always had sports psychologists and rehab training centres ready and available for players across age groups.“Anshul was very upset that he got the injury. He came to the academy with the sole motive to get fit at the earliest. HCA has a training centre which is available 24 hours a day. He worked day and night to get fit. He didn’t want it to get to the stage where BCCI ’s centre of excellence had to get involved,” Ashwini told TOI.Kamboj also attended classes with sports psychologists. “The classes with the psychologists also prepared players for the times when they will be injured. It is about staying positive and not getting frustrated. Those classes also taught him to deal with success and failure. It’s important for a player to know how to handle success and a good run of form,” Ashwini said.It wasn’t the first time Kamboj had come close to getting his big break. The selectors were very close to picking him in the XV for the India ‘A’ tour of Australia which preceded the five Test series. However, the team management felt that Navdeep Saini, another fast bowler from Karnal, was the better option.“Anshul has always been a quiet boy. He used to travel from Karnal to Sultanpur every week before HCA arranged accommodation near the academy. His strength is that he is very determined and disciplined. He has never missed a practice session in the last seven-eight years. He always remained patient,” Ashwini said.",Kamboj had to fly back from England in June this year to treat a shin injury.

Former Chicago Bulls player Dwyane Wade recently criticized Bleacher Report's Kobe Bryant ranking. For context, the NBA star was not listed in the top 10 of Bleacher Report's June ranking of the 100 greatest NBA players of all time. There is ongoing debate among players on the proper ranking of specific players on that list. In the meantime, the Hall of Famer expressed on his podcast channels that he finds it hard to comprehend the commotion surrounding a single basketball article authored by individuals who have never participated in the NBA.Making an attempt at ranking all of the NBA players is never easy, but Bleacher Report recently gave it a go. Although there will always be people who disagree with particular rankings, the ranking of the late NBA legend Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers was negative.The first player to criticize the report for ranking him as the 10th greatest player of all time was NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal. Now Dwyane Wade, the former player for the Miami Heat said the same.During his recent podcast episode, he said:""If you wanna ask us hoopers who played against [Kobe Bryant], all of us are going to talk top three [all time]... Like we all gonna talk top three if you played against Mamba. But, someone's opinion that's never played against Kobe, who has never played a game of basketball at the level that we play it at, having him at 11, why am I up in arms about something like that?""He continued:""They had rankings when he played in the league, and they had him low, I remember one year, and Kobe addressed it..Like, 'who is these idiots?' Like, 'why would I listen to these idiots?' And I'm not calling the person that did this an idiot, but what I'm saying is when someone does something like that, Kobe was like, 'this is idiotic to me.'""The NBA player-cum-podcaster went on to say that if someone hasn't watched him play, they aren't qualified to pass judgement. He continued:“So how can I rank somebody in an order [if] I’ve never seen a lot of these guys … it can never be fair in my opinion … I know who was great. I know who was hard to guard, and I know who was a bad m*********** when I watched them.”Dwyane Wade went on to support Kobe Bryant , saying that it is disrespectful to not include him in the top ten of the Bleacher Report's new all-time rankings.

Adrian Peterson shares preparation video for his upcoming boxing match

Baby Joe is not slacking on getting prepped for the match

A few months ago, a video from a social club in Houston called JokerStars went viral. Former Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson was seen getting into a fist fight with professional poker player, Joe ""Baby Joe"" Castaneda. Now, the two rivals have signed for a Celebrity Boxing match, which will be set for some time in the near future. After their near brawls, this will be the perfect opportunity for both Peterson and Castaneda to release all the pent-up tension between them.Earlier this year, Adrian Peterson and Joe ""Baby Joe"" Castaneda had a disagreement during a game of poker which led to a physical altercation between the two of them. Then again, on May 27, a game of Poker led to another altercation that went viral. Celebrity Boxing founder Damon Feldman thus got the two of them to come forth for a boxing match, while he still irons out all the kinks before the two get inside a ring.Ahead of their match, NFL legend Peterson has shared a video of his training session. Sporting a maroon tee, grey shorts, and black shoes, he gloved up for his upcoming match against his nemesis. The running back looked sharp as he practiced his moves with a training partner. TMZ shared the video, writing:""Adrian Peterson's begun training for his celebrity boxing match with his poker rival ...and while his hands could certainly use some more sharpening, it's clear he's in great shape.""While fans are yet to be informed of when and where the match will take place, both men are getting ready to gain the upper hand before they have to fight it out with each other.Joe ""Baby Joe"" Castaneda, the professional poker player who is getting ready for his first bout inside a boxing ring, is not slacking off. Similar to his opponent, he too has been preparing for the upcoming match and has hired combat sports coach Teddy Concepcion to train him. Both of them have signed with Celeb Boxing for their boxing match, and we will get to know the details soon.After their fight over a poker game dispute, Adrian Peterson had apologized, saying he ""felt really bad"" over what happened and did ""regret"" that things turned nasty. But that's not going to stop either of them from coming after each other inside the ring. Peterson already has prior experience with the matter when he faced fellow former NFL running back Le'Veon Bell back in 2022. Though he lost out on his first outing, maybe this time his luck has turned for him.Also Read: NFL legend Adrian Peterson signs Celebrity Boxing deal to fight poker rival in surprise ring battle","Adrian Peterson and Joe ""Baby Joe"" Castaneda have signed for a Celebrity Boxing match.

Dylan Raiola’s journey faces first big test at Arrowhead Stadium

Before he’s even cemented his place as Nebraska’s starting quarterback, Dylan Raiola has already captured national attention—not just for his talent, but for who he’s trying to become. Raiola has drawn early comparisons to Kansas City Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes , and he’s not running from it. In fact, he welcomes the parallel and has a very specific way of framing it.Speaking during Big Ten Media Days in Las Vegas, Raiola compared his admiration for Mahomes to Kobe Bryant’s relentless pursuit of Michael Jordan’s greatness. “I’m not comparing myself to Kobe or anything, but like Kobe did to Mike, that’s kind of what it is for me to Patrick,” he said on the Cover 3 Podcast. “He’s one of the best quarterbacks in the league right now, if not the best.”It’s more than just watching highlight reels. Raiola works with the same trainers who helped shape Mahomes into a Super Bowl champion—quarterbacks coach Jeff Christensen and performance coach Bobby Stroupe. He studies Mahomes’ film, mimics his movements, and has even adopted the signature Mahomes look—jersey number 15, headband, and curly hair.The connection isn’t just visual. Mahomes and Raiola have built a real relationship. Mahomes once referred to Raiola as “Lil cuzzo” on social media, and the two reportedly text and call regularly. Raiola says he values that line of communication but understands he must carve his own path on the field.Dylan Raiola is frequently compared to Patrick Mahomes due to similarities in playing style, appearance, jersey number, and even pregame routines. Raiola embraces the comparison and studies Mahomes closely as part of his development.Raiola said he views his relationship with Mahomes similarly to how Kobe Bryant studied and modeled his game after Michael Jordan. He emphasized that Mahomes serves as a role model and blueprint for his own growth as a quarterback.Dylan Raiola and the Nebraska Cornhuskers will open their 2025 season on August 28 against Cincinnati at Arrowhead Stadium, the home of Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs.The comparisons will be hard to ignore on August 28 when Nebraska opens its 2025 season at Arrowhead Stadium—Mahomes’ home turf—against Cincinnati. It will be a defining moment for Raiola, who’s coming off a freshman campaign marked by growing pains: 13 touchdowns, 11 interceptions, and a 3-6 Big Ten record.Also Read: “It hit me hard”: Colts’ Anthony Richardson addresses shoulder injury concern But for Raiola, the mission is clear.

The incident drew concern and strong words from former England captain Mike Atherton, who called the injury a “massive blow” to India’s chances.Pant, who had looked in ominous touch with 37 off 48 balls, sustained the injury while attempting a reverse sweep off Chris Woakes. The ball ricocheted onto his boot, leaving him visibly distressed. He was seen removing his shoe to reveal significant swelling and was eventually taken off the field on a medical cart.Speaking on Sky Sports, Atherton underscored the gravity of the situation.“If Pant is out of the game, out of the series, that's a massive blow for India. And that 264 for 4 becomes 264 for 5 with the new ball due,” he said. “Potential to knock India over reasonably swiftly tomorrow. If he comes back and bats, then he could change the game again tomorrow. So there's that uncertainty. We don't know. It looked quite a serious injury.You don’t get carted off in a golf cart if it’s not a serious injury.”Sai Sudharsan, who top-scored for India with 61, was batting alongside Pant when the incident occurred. “He was in a lot of pain,” Sudharsan said after stumps. “He’s gone for scans, and we’ll get to know overnight. It will definitely have consequences if he doesn’t come back to bat.”England’s Liam Dawson, who took the key wicket of Yashasvi Jaiswal, echoed those concerns. “It didn’t look a great injury,” Dawson said. “I can’t see him taking much more part in this game.”Pant has been a vital cog for India in the series, scoring 462 runs at an average of 77. His availability could be the difference between India staying alive or conceding the series.","Wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant was forced to retire hurt after a painful blow to his right foot.

Poll Who do you think has been the more impactful player in the opening partnership? Yashasvi Jaiswal KL Rahul

When Yashasvi Jaiswal made his Test debut in 2023, KL Rahul had been playing international cricket for nine years, though he was still struggling to find a permanent place in India’s Test batting lineup. India, in fact, have been searching for a stable opening pair for most of the past decade.It took a controversial retirement from Rohit Sharma for Rahul to finally get a long run as opener. It also brought him together with Jaiswal at the top of the order. In England, the pair has given enough evidence that they are here to stay. The Indian team management and selectors can now end their long search.The 94-run partnership at Old Trafford on Wednesday demonstrated the maturity of the pair. Jaiswal has invariably dominated the partnership since the whirlwind effort in Perth against Australia last Nov, when Rohit skipped the first Test of that series due to the birth of his second child. Since then, Jaiswal has been the aggressor and Rahul the anchor.Wednesday morning was different, though. In conditions that aided prodigious seam and swing, Jaiswal put his head down and battled hard. Rahul ensured that the scoreboard kept moving.He didn’t allow the pressure to build on Jaiswal.Both of them are poles apart as personalities. Rahul comes across the more academic one in his preparations while Jaiswal is the street fighter who loves to be let loose. Rahul likes to calm himself down before play. Jaiswal loves hitting balls for an hour before the umpires walk in. They aren’t buddies going out for fun nights either, but the partnership seems to work. A healthy appetite for runs has been the common thread in this partnership. Jofra Archer got the measure of Jaiswal in both innings at Lord’s. Perhaps because of the extravagant pull that he played to get dismissed him for a duck in the second innings at Lord’s, Jaiswal was ready for the grind. But what stood out was Rahul allowing Jaiswal to face just five deliveries from Archer in the first hour of play.In the morning session, the ball jagged around the most it has in this series. Both Rahul and Jaiswal knew they couldn’t afford to expose the middle order to the new ball. Rahul has openly said that he has been more comfortable opening the innings. It was never a position assured to Rahul in the first 10 years of his Test career. He has been forever trying to prove his worth as a Test batter.Jaiswal’s aggressive intent and scoring rate at the top of the innings has helped Rahul ease back into the role. On Wednesday, Rahul took it on himself to ease Jaiswal back into runs after a poor Lord’s Test.",India have been searching for a stable opening pair for most of the past decade. It took a controversial retirement from Rohit Sharma for Rahul to finally get a long run as opener. It also brought him together with Jaiswal at the top of the order.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122871644,imgsize-142216,width-400,resizemode-4/122871644.jpg"

Also read:

The NFL preseason is underway, and the San Francisco 49ers still don’t seem ready to make a hot start. They are planning to start the camp this week, but without two of their crown jewels in stable health. Christian McCaffrey, the superstar running back, couldn’t showcase his prowess in more than just four games last season as he suffered from a distorted Achilles and PCL injury. But now, the situation looks to be better, but the question it begs: what kind of better? Can he really show up for the 2025 regular season and help the 49ers get rid of the 6-11 curse with ease? Well, the answer is all but promising.The disaster started with a simple pre-season calf strain, but it eventually grew into a more serious Achilles tendinitis. The 28-year-old couldn’t even think of lacing up his cleats for the first eight games of the season. However, after prolonged medical care, he made a remarkable comeback in week 9. But before the fans could even process the joy, he went down again, and this time with a season-ending PCL injury during a lackluster loss to the Buffaloes.Kyle Shanahan has high hopes of McCaffrey defying all the odds and being back to his full health before the season kicks in. He said that the RB is, and so is their most significant left tackle, Trent Williams.The other officials also suggested positive feedback on McCaffrey’s ongoing healing. But we are still too early to reach a long-term conclusion.Sure, the offensive player of the year 2023 gives his all to be back in the lore. But it’s just July, and it won’t be a shell-shocking update if his two major injuries recur during September’s high-octane schedule and affect his performances in some way or other. However, for now, all signs point toward smooth sailing.McCaffrey wasn’t in the scene for so long. The 49ers RB room is typically leaned towards guns like Saquon Barkley, Derrick Henry, and emerging stars Jahmyr Gibbs and Bijan Robinson in the meantime. But don’t get it wrong, the veteran was pushing himself hard in silence when no one was watching. He never gave up on the idea of being back in his prime. He knows he is still the guy the team needs to win games, no matter what fans anticipate about rookie Ashton Jeanty or anyone else.And the star running back behaves like that. On Monday, he fueled the return anticipation with a highly positive Instagram update featuring a few snaps of his sculpted physique after an intense workout. That grit in his body, the sheer passion in the sweat is undeniable, and so is his urge to return. It seems it’s only a matter of time before the 49ers get a taste of their boy, renewed, recharged!There are no official updates yet. But the way he’s progressing, it looks so. Also, the officials hint toward a full-fledged return in the season opener.He was selected to play three Pro Bowls and has won one Offensive Player of the Year award.Yes, Christian McCaffrey carries the esteemed genes of three-time Super Bowl champion Ed McCaffrey and Lisa McCaffrey.","The San Francisco 49ers are planning to start training camp this week.

Urgency grows as Bengals risk losing momentum without defensive stars

The Cincinnati Bengals are back in training camp, but not everything is going according to plan. Star quarterback Joe Burrow is already voicing concerns—and this time, it’s not about the offense. Two key defensive players, Trey Hendrickson and rookie Shemar Stewart, are missing from camp, and it’s causing real problems.A year ago, Joe Burrow delivered one of the best seasons of his career. But despite his elite performances, the Bengals failed to make the playoffs. Why? The defense simply couldn’t keep up. Cincinnati gave up too many big plays and failed to close out tight games.Now, with the 2025 season approaching, the Bengals were counting on a revamped defensive unit to fix those issues. But the absence of Hendrickson and Stewart is a major setback. Hendrickson is one of the NFL’s most reliable pass rushers, and Stewart was drafted in the first round to bring fresh energy off the edge. Without them, Cincinnati’s defense is lacking the power and speed it desperately needs.Both players are staying away from camp for different reasons. Hendrickson is seeking a contract extension that reflects his value as a top-tier defensive end.Stewart, meanwhile, is holding out until his rookie contract language is finalized. These unresolved issues have left the Bengals defense thin at a critical position.Joe Burrow didn’t hide his frustration when asked about the situation. He described it as “disappointing,” a word that sums up how fans and coaches feel too. In a competitive AFC North, the Bengals can’t afford distractions or a weakened defense.Trey Hendrickson is holding out of Bengals training camp as he seeks a contract extension. He wants a raise that reflects his status as one of the NFL’s top pass rushers.First-round rookie Shemar Stewart is sitting out due to unresolved contract language in his rookie deal. He’s asking for simplified terms before officially joining the team.Joe Burrow called the situation “disappointing” and emphasized the importance of having a full roster, especially on defense, as the Bengals prepare for the 2025 NFL season.Every day Hendrickson and Stewart miss is a lost opportunity to build chemistry on defense. The Bengals need both players in camp, learning schemes and working with teammates. While Burrow will continue to lead a powerful offense, he knows a strong defense is essential for a deep playoff run.Also Read: Good news for Buffalo Bills fans: Iconic red helmets make long-awaited comeback in Week 18 Cincinnati must act fast to get both players back on the field.

Rishabh Pant suffers right foot injury in India vs England Test; taken off in an ambulance

Poll Who do you think is the standout player for India in this match so far? Sai Sudharsan Ravindra Jadeja Shardul Thakur KL Rahul

Half an hour before the toss, head coach Gautam Gambhir got into a huddle with bowling coach Morne Morkel, batting coach Sitanshu Kotak and captain Shubman Gill. Soon, Shardul Thakur took off his jacket, marked his run-up and was seen going through his warm-ups. India decided to go in with the extra seamer — in overcast conditions here at Old Trafford — and leave out Karun Nair. Ben Stokes elected to bowl first, in a bid to run through the opposition. It was supposed to be the most challenging first-day conditions for opening batters.An hour into the last session, India would have believed they had negated the seam-bowling advantage before Rishabh Pant hobbled off with a bruised right foot.The incident led to a lapse in concentration from a well set Sai Sudharsan, who fell after scoring a classy 61 off 151 balls to expose the lower middle order. That left Ravindra Jadeja again with some damage control to do, this time with Shardul Thakur for company. Thakur responded to the team management’s call by taking India to 264/4 before bad light intervened. Jadeja and Thakur will resume Day Two against the new ball.Barring the capitulation in the fourth innings of the third Test, the Indian top order has by and large responded with big performances on this tour. Under the grey skies at Old Trafford, India may have found a new batting star on this tour.Sai Sudharsan displayed exemplary technique and temperament, reaching 61 off 151 to stabilise the innings. And then the lack of experience kicked in. He hooked Stokes straight down the throat of Brydon Carse at long-leg, exposing the lower middle order.Sudharsan’s job was partly made easy by openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul, who ensured India didn’t lose any wickets in the first session.Sudharsan, however, had a job to do once Jaiswal and Rahul departed in the space of 26 runs, for 58 and 46 respectively. The Manchester pitch has been a batter’s paradise this first-class season. It has true pace and bounce. But one must remember the batters have been spoilt on pretty docile pitches in the first three Tests.Sudharsan was brought in after Nair failed to convert his starts in the first three Tests. The Indian team expected more from a No. 3 and Sudharsan delivered, batting out 151 balls.Stokes, expectedly, threw the toughest challenges at the Indian batters. He experimented with his line, field and movement.He has been the most threatening English bowler in this series by far, and carried the rhythm from the Lord’s Test into this Test. Stokes had sledged Gill at Lord’s, saying, “He has scored 600 runs for the series. He ain’t getting any more!” Stokes took the responsibility to dismiss the Indian captain with a sharp inswinger which hit Gill’s pads in front of the stumps as he shouldered arms.Sudharsan survived a chance when wicketkeeper Jamie Smith dropped tickled down the leg-side off Stokes. The batter finally succumbed to the mind games of the England captain, leaving India delicately placed.","Sai Sudharsan displayed exemplary technique and temperament, reaching 61 off 151 to stabilise the innings.
