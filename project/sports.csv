NEW DELHI: India's batting line-up faces a critical test as they aim to bounce back against an in-form South African side on the challenging SuperSport Park pitch in the third T20I on Wednesday. In the second T20I, India's top order struggled, managing just 124 for six as they faltered against South Africa’s pacers, and Centurion’s pace-friendly surface could bring similar challenges.At the top, Abhishek Sharma’s prolonged dry spell has become a concern. The team management might consider partnering Tilak Varma with Sanju Samson and introducing Ramandeep Singh in the middle order for added depth.Key batters Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, and Rinku Singh have also had inconsistent performances. While Pandya scored 39 in the last game, he was slow to find boundaries, leaving room for improvement. Samson, in form, will need support, or the others must step up if he has an off day.On the bowling side, Arshdeep Singh will seek redemption after conceding 28 runs in his last two overs, possibly making way for alternatives like Yash Dayal. The spinners, Varun Chakravarthy and Ravi Bishnoi, have excelled, and the bounce here could further aid them.For South Africa, seasoned batsmen like Aiden Markram, David Miller, and Heinrich Klaasen have yet to make an impact, and their contributions could be crucial against India's spinners.The third T20I between India and South Africa will be played on Wednesday, November 13 at Supersport Park in Centurion.The third T20I between India and South Africa starts at 8:30 PM IST and the toss will take place at 8:00 PM IST.The third T20I match between India and South Africa will be telecast on Sports18 and Sports18 HD channels.Follow the Live coverage of the third T20I match between India and South Africa onSuryakumar Yadav (c), Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (WK), Rinku Singh, Tilak Varma, Jitesh Sharma (WK), Hardik Pandya.

The Dallas Cowboys are having a tough season, and things are starting to heat up. With a disappointing 3-6 record, frustrations are building, especially after standout linebacker Micah Parsons made some controversial comments that have sparked backlash from fans and analysts alike. As the team faces mounting challenges, many are wondering if changes are on the way for the Cowboys.The Dallas Cowboys are in rough waters this season, facing mounting struggles and internal tension. With a disappointing 3-6 record under owner Jerry Jones and head coach Mike McCarthy , frustrations are boiling over—particularly for standout linebacker Micah Parsons, whose recent remarks have drawn backlash from fans, former players, and analysts.Ex-NFL player Shaun Smith didn’t hold back, calling out Parsons for his comments on McCarthy and Rex Ryan. Smith fired back, “He has that much time to listen to his critics? Go watch some film,” urging Parsons to focus on the field rather than off-field drama.Following the Cowboys' crushing loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, Parsons voiced his disappointment, shifting attention away from McCarthy's future and onto veteran teammates like Zack Martin, remarking,“Mike can go wherever he wants… I feel bad for guys like Zack Martin who might be in their last year or on their way out.” This was perceived as a subtle jab at McCarthy, hinting that losing seasoned players like Martin would be a bigger blow than a coaching change.McCarthy addressed the team’s performance, calling out turnovers as ""unacceptable,"" while Jones acknowledged the gap, bluntly stating, “Philadelphia is a high-caliber team.

Mike Williams' sly dig on social media at former Jets teammate Aaron Rodgers

Mike Williams landed a sly dig on social media at former Jets teammate Aaron Rodgers, scoring the game-winning touchdown for the Steelers. Williams made a 32-yard touchdown catch in the Steelers' 28-27 win over the Commanders, which accounted for his only target and reception of the game.His time in New York included being thrown under the bus by Rodgers after slipping on a fourth-quarter interception in a loss to the Bills last month.

""Thankful #WholeLotta #WeBack #RedLine,"" Williams wrote. The ""#RedLine"" caption refers to Rodgers's quote about Williams from the Jets game, emphasizing that Williams must be on the red line, a red stripe often used by NFL teams to aid receivers in their routes.“There’s two verticals, Allen [Lazard]’s down the seam, and Mike’s down the red line,” Rodgers said after the game. “So, I’m throwing a no look to the red line. When I peak my eyes back there Mike’s running an ‘in-breaker’ … it’s gotta be down the red line.”Williams, though guarded about his Jets experience, said the opportunity to play with the franchise and work for Rodgers was ""cool."" He had also said that the time he missed early with the Jets is what got him out of favor. “Going there after the ACL [surgery] not having OTAs or training camp to get the chemistry right … [Rodgers] is real detailed.

Victor Wembanyama’s shines with new NBA record



San Antonio Spurs star Victor Wembanyama has recently made a stunning record in the NBA. His latest performance against the Washington Wizards proved that he is here to make his name shine. In the game, Wembanyama became the first center in NBA history to record such a stat line. He made more than five threes in three consecutive games. Also, he has been the youngest center in history to score over 50 points.At just 20 years old, Wembanyama delivered an impressive performance adding up 34 points, 14 rebounds, six assists, and three blocks in a dominant win for the Spurs. Their latest victory marked their fifth of the 2024 season. Most importantly, Monday’s game was significant for the young star as he created a stunning record to join the league of elite NBA stars. It was Wembanyama’s 82nd NBA game and it appears that it is just the beginning for him.Early in the fourth quarter against the Wizards, Wembanyama surpassed his previous career high of 40 points, reaching 50 and he is still adding to his total. While the Spurs have had a slow start this season with a 5-6 record, their progress is clearly visible and with Wembanyama’s performance, they are seemingly confident. Also, their rise in the game can be seen as a significant improvement compared to last year, when they finished near the bottom of the standings. Now, the team is beginning to find its footing with Wembanyama leading the way.Additionally, with his recent standout performance against the Kings, Wembanyama entered rare company, joining legends like Oscar Robertson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird, Blake Griffin, and Sidney Wicks. These players are the only ones in NBA history to record at least 1,700 points, 800 rebounds, and 300 assists in their first 82 games, marking a major achievement in the young star's already impressive career.“Approaching the game mentally is more important than approaching it even physically,” he told reporters after the game against the Kings. “Of course, we’re going to take care of our bodies but there are people whose jobs it is to take care of our bodies, make sure we’re healthy. Of course, we’re going to think about that but to be great you’ve just got to approach the game with that killer mentality,” he added.Also Read: San Antonio Spurs’ Victor Wembanyama becomes the sixth player in NBA history to register 1,700 points, 800 rebounds and 300 assists Certainly, he is on a solid start and Spurs fans are expecting him to keep the team in the frontline.

Snake sighting in Steelers' locker room



In their Week 10 showdown against the Washington Commanders, the Pittsburgh Steelers faced an unexpected twist before even stepping onto the field. While game-day nerves are common, the Steelers found themselves dealing with a surprising visitor—an unwelcome snake that had slithered into their locker room. The unexpected incident was revealed by Steelers defensive lineman Cameron Heyward on his Not Just Football podcast, where he recounted the team’s bizarre encounter with the slippery intruder.According to Heyward, the team's warm-up routine was interrupted as players returned to find their locker room in a minor frenzy. ""Before the game, I got out, warm up, I come back in… Everybody was a little bit shocked when I came in,” Heyward shared, describing the moment he discovered the snake emerging from quarterback Russell Wilson’s locker. This sight left players both startled and amused, with Heyward noting the team’s failed attempts to catch the elusive snake, which ultimately slithered back into hiding before anyone could capture it.“I was like; ‘what’s going on?’ There was a snake in our locker room, a snake!""A snake. And it was coming from the bottom of Russell's {Steelers quarterback Russell Wilson] locker. Everybody was like thrown for a loop. A snake in our locker room!""The worst part? Heyward says the team was unable to remove the serpent from the premises before it slithered away.""Nobody got it,"" Heyward said with a laugh. ""Nobody got it. It slithered right back under.""Despite the initial shock, Steelers Head Coach Mike Tomlin quickly refocused the team. Tomlin reportedly brushed off the incident, reminding his players that they could either “worry about the snake” or focus on their objective: securing a victory. Heyward explained how the incident played into the team’s resilient mindset. “Mike T was like, ‘We can make a big deal about a small locker room … There being a snake. But it doesn't matter. We still got to win.’” Tomlin’s no-nonsense approach reinforced the Steelers’ determination to handle adversity, no matter how unusual.The snake incident at Washington’s home field, Northwest Stadium (formerly known as FedEx Field), adds to the venue's history of odd and troublesome events. In recent seasons, the stadium has faced everything from structural issues—like collapsing barriers narrowly missing Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts—to malfunctions in the hot water system, which left the showers unusable for both the Commanders and New York Giants last year.Also Read: Micah Parsons Stats: Height, Weight, Age and More Ultimately, the Steelers brushed off the unexpected disruption and emerged victorious, edging past Washington with a 28-27 win.

Rishabh Pant. The next Test captain | Beyond the Boundary Highlights | TOI Sports

NEW DELHI: As India gear up for the forthcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia, experts are zeroing in on the players who can make a difference in the series.Both the teams have match-winners in their teams and the series is set to be a riveting one providing edge-of-the-seat excitement.The Australia media has already gone overboard in not just praising the Indian superstars but as has always been the case, mind games have also begun.A couple of days back, the front page of the Australian newspaper The Daily Telegraph had a picture of Virat Kohli with a title in Hindi that translated to 'Fight for the ages' and had Yashasvi Jaiswal on the back page with the title in Punjabi that translated to 'The New King'.The sports page of the newspaper not just had the journey of Jaiswal chronicled but it also heralded Jaiswal as India's next superstar, stating that the opener is on track to succeed Kohli.Now a viral video shows former cricketers Adam Gilchrist and Michael Vaughan during a talk show and the host asks former England captain Vaughan that with the Border-Gavaskar Trophy coming up, who would be the one player he is looking forward to watch in this summer from the Indian squad.Vaughan replies, ""Yashasvi Jaiswal would be one, but Rishabh Pant , I think he is absolutely box-office. He makes batting look more like he's just playing in the backyard. For India to be really competitive, this man on screen Rishabh is gonna have to play a blinder once again.""During the fourth and final Test of India's last tour of Australia at the Gabba in January 2021, Pant played one of the most iconic innings in Test cricket history.Pant played a fearless, match-winning knock, scoring an unbeaten 89 off 138 balls to chase down 328 runs on the fifth day as India achieved a record-breaking victory at the Gabba, a venue where Australia had been undefeated in Tests for 32 years.The innings highlighted Pant's fearless approach and unyielding belief, even under immense pressure. His aggressive mindset, combined with clever shot selection, helped India pull off one of the greatest chases in Test cricket.This was a major moment in his career and elevated his status as a cricketer who thrives in high-pressure situations and uses his attacking play style to turn games.","Rishabh Pant played one of the most iconic innings in Test cricket history.

NEW DELHI: Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting took a fresh dig at India head coach Gautam Gambhir after clarifying his remarks about Virat Kohli 's performance.Speaking on the podcast 'The Run Home with Joel & Fletch,' Ponting again labeled Gambhir as a 'prickly character'. He suggested that Gambhir's reaction, during the press conference before leaving for Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT), was influenced by India's recent Test series loss to New Zealand.""I'm not sure if I mentioned a couple of them [other Indian batters], but I reckon he's just throwing me in the deep end, trying to find their two most experienced and make sure when they come out, they put that back on me,"" Ponting said.In the lead-up to the BGT, Ponting had raised concerns about Kohli's form. He highlighted Kohli's declining home average, which has dropped to almost 30, with only three centuries in the past five years. However, Ponting also acknowledged Kohli's excellent track record in Australia, suggesting that this tour could be an opportunity for him to regain his form.Ponting believes Gambhir misinterpreted his comments and reacted emotionally, possibly due to the recent series defeat.""I think the hair on the back of his neck was already standing up. We got a bit of history as well, but he took a chance to fire back at me,"" Ponting said, adding that Gambhir seemed anxious and was looking for a reason to retaliate.Despite their differences, Ponting stood by his initial assessment of Kohli's recent form, attributing his concerns to the statistical decline in Kohli's performance. Ponting, however, expressed confidence that the Australian tour could be a turning point for Kohli.""I said if there ever was a tour where he [Kohli] could turn things around, it would be this,"" Ponting noted.","Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting takes a fresh dig at India head coach Gautam Gambhir after clarifying his remarks about Virat Kohli's performance.

NEW DELHI: South African star batter David Miller ’s dismissal by Hardik Pandya sparked memories of the 2024 T20 World Cup final in a thrilling moment of deja vu during the 3rd T20I between India and South Africa on Wednesday.In this latest encounter, Miller attempted a fierce pull shot off a short delivery from Pandya in the 16th over, looking to drive South Africa closer to the target of 220.Axar Patel, stationed at the boundary, jumped high to pull off a spectacular catch, cutting short Miller’s knock at a crucial juncture.Watch:This dramatic catch bore a striking resemblance to the iconic scene during the T20 World Cup final earlier this year, where Pandya, under immense pressure, successfully defended 16 runs in the final over, clinching the trophy for India.In that tense moment, Miller had also aimed to clear the boundary with a big hit, but Suryakumar Yadav executed a brilliant piece of fielding on the ropes to dismiss him.Surya had skillfully positioned himself by stepping outside the boundary before leaping back in to complete the catch, leaving South Africa just shy of their target and sealing the World Cup for India by seven runs.Wednesday's T20I saw Pandya’s bowling and fielding unit rise to the occasion once again.Axar’s athleticism and alertness made up for an earlier dropped catch, and his effort not only dismissed Miller but also curbed South Africa’s scoring momentum.Pandya's impact as a game-changer shone through yet again as India won by a narrow margin of 11 runs, successfully defending their 219-run total.With this win, India strengthened their momentum on tour, having taken a 2-1 lead in the four-match series.Suryakumar's Men in Blue will take on the Proteas for the fourth and final T20I on Friday at The Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg.","Hardik Pandya dismisses David Miller during India vs South Africa 3rd T20I.

But Jansen had other plans. Walking in at No. 7, the tall all-rounder unleashed a furious attack on India's bowlers, hammering Hardik Pandya for 26 runs in the penultimate over, which included two sixes and three fours.

NEW DELHI: With the standoff between India and Pakistan continuing over the 2025 Champions Trophy , there can be huge financial implications for the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) if the marquee tournament is either postponed or moved to any other country.The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has made it clear that their men's cricket team will not be going to Pakistan for the tournament next year.The tournament is currently scheduled to take place in Pakistan from February 19 to March 9. Due to the uncertainty, no match schedule has been made public.This would be the first time that Pakistan would be hosting a global ICC event since they co-hosted the ODI World Cup in 1996 and the PCB wants to set an example that Pakistan, often targeted for security issues, is safe for big tournaments.But the tournament has been thrown into turmoil after India's refusal and the PCB has rejected the concept of a hybrid tournament, in which India would play its matches at neutral locations, like the United Arab Emirates.According to a report in Cricbuzz, if the tournament is either postponed or moved to any other country, the PCB risks facing ICC sanctions, including cuts to substantial ICC funding, if it withdraws.Not just that, the report adds that moving or postponing the Champions Trophy would mean losing out on potentially USD 65 million as hosting fees, substantial money for the PCB.The report adds that this loss would rankle further considering that PCB made serious investments to upgrade infrastructure for the Champions Trophy at the three earmarked venues - Karachi, Rawalpindi, and Lahore.The PCB has asked the ICC to explain India's refusal to send a team to Pakistan for the tournament.Pakistani media reported on Tuesday that the PCB would be unwilling to accept security reasons for India's refusal to visit, since New Zealand have toured Pakistan three times in the past two years, England have visited twice and Australia once in the same period.Without Pakistan's participation, the ICC could face contractual challenges, with broadcasters and sponsors expecting both teams to play in high-stakes matches.Legal disputes with commercial partners, potential revenue drops and a decline in ICC's financial distribution to members are likely consequences.With the BCCI insisting on a hybrid model, there is a possibility of a change of venue for the mega event.But as of now, the ball is in ICC's court.","The standoff between India and Pakistan continues over the 2025 Champions Trophy.

Premier India pacer to turn out for Bengal in Ranji game, reigniting talk of a possible late entry into India's Test squad in Australia

IND have what it takes to challenge this AUS team in upcoming #BGT | #beyondtheboundary

KOLKATA: India fast bowler Mohammed Shami is all set to play for Bengal in their next Ranji Trophy Elite Group 'C' game, putting to rest all speculation over his comeback plans after being left out of India's squad for the five-Test series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia.Bengal will take on Madhya Pradesh in Indore from Wednesday.TOI has learnt that the 34-year-old pacer's movements will be closely monitored by physio Nitin Patel, who has travelled with the Uttar Pradesh-born cricketer and will be stationed in Indore over the next four days.Shami's fitness status was closely monitored ahead of India's BGT squad announcement but captain Rohit Sharma 's assertion that ""we don't want to take an undercooked Shami to Australia"" was indication the team management was not fully convinced about the fast bowler's Test-match recovery.Shami, however, was positive he could take the flight to Australia after playing a few Ranji matches. He can, however, play only one red-ball game to prove his fitness because the Ranji Trophy season will be played in two halves.In Shami's absence, India picked a largely inexperienced pace attack - including Akash Deep, Harshit Rana, Nitish Kumar Reddy and Prasidh Krishna - to back up Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj. Mukesh Kumar, Navdeep Saini , and Khaleel Ahmed are in the reserves.The Bengal team management has said the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) has not issued any guidelines or restrictions on Shami. ""We are happy to have him back,"" Bengal coach Laxmi Ratan Shukla told TOI from Indore.

#LIVE: What is future of Champions Trophy? | #beyondtheboundary

NEW DELHI: Former Australian pacer Brett Lee has come up with a piece of advice for Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli , who endured terrible runs with the bat in Test cricket this year.Lee suggested that Rohit and Virat should take a step back from the game to focus on refining their techniques ahead of the upcoming series against Australia.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Lee emphasised how recent poor performances could lead to mounting pressure on both Rohit and Kohli.""When you have a couple of bad runs back-to-back, that's when the pressure could set in. I guess the thing now is someone like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma just have to go back to the drawing board. Work on that technique, freshen up, get away from cricket as much as they can and then hit the ground running when they go to Australia, because I can promise you - these Australian fast bowlers will attack Rohit Sharma with that brand new ball,"" Brett Lee said.So far in 2024, both Kohli and Rohit have struggled to find their best form, attracting scrutiny following India's recent 0-3 series loss against New Zealand.Rohit has accumulated 588 runs from 11 matches this year, averaging 29.40 with two centuries and two fifties. Meanwhile, Kohli has managed just 250 runs from six matches (12 innings), averaging 22.72 with just one half-century.Former Aussie batter Michael Hussey backed Rohit and Kohli and said that one cannot write off champion players like them.Speaking on Fox Sports, Hussey said Aussies will find out where India stand in terms of ""mentally and from a skill perspective"" only after the first Test match of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy . He added that India have got many players who are crowd-pullers.""We will find out in the first Test match where they are at, mentally and from a skill perspective as well. They will be hurt by this, India. They have got a lot of crowd pullers and quality. We just heard from Gambhir talking about Rohit and Kohli not making runs. The silliest thing you can do is to write off champion players,"" Hussey said.",Brett Lee says Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma should take a step back from the game.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma were recently spotted in Perth , enjoying a family outing with their daughter, Vamika . The celebrated couple, who often keep their personal life private, appeared relaxed and happy, embracing some downtime together.Star Indian batter Kohli, who is currently in Australia for the high-profile Border-Gavaskar Trophy , took the opportunity to spend quality time with Anushka and Vamika, exploring the scenic city and enjoying moments away from the cricket field.Fans were delighted to catch a glimpse of the family, with photos of them enjoying the coffee on the streets of Perth going viral in no time.Kohli, the first Indian player to arrive in Australia on Sunday, officially began his preparations for India’s opening Test against Australia, starting on November 22 in Perth, by training at the WACA practice pitches on Wednesday.With precision and focus, he hit the nets, setting the tone for the upcoming series. Kohli’s early arrival in Perth has caught attention, reflecting his intent to sharpen his game well ahead of the series opener.His practice sessions have notably focused on short-of-length deliveries, a staple of Australian pitches, as he looks to acclimate to the unique challenges posed by local conditions.Kohli’s typically reliable bat has been uncharacteristically quiet this year. His 2024 stats highlight a challenging period, with only 488 runs in 25 innings (19 matches) across formats, averaging just 20.33 and including two half-centuries.His recent form in Test cricket has also raised concerns; in 10 innings over five home matches against Bangladesh and New Zealand, he managed a modest 192 runs. These numbers underscore a dip in form that’s unusual for the prolific batter, adding pressure as he heads into the high-stakes five-Test series against Australia, where he’ll look to regain his rhythm and confidence.","Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma were recently spotted in Perth.

Virat & Rohit’s Home Struggles: Left-Arm Spin & Lost Intent? | Beyond the Boundary Highlights

India captain Rohit Sharma 's availability for the first Test of the coming Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) is still uncertain, but Australia have their plans in place to ""torpedo"" him whenever he comes out to open during India's tour, says former leg-spinner Kerry O'Keeffe.Rohit has had a forgettable time lately in Test cricket , scoring just 133 runs in 10 innings at home leading up to the BGT. And while he will be satisfied with the 2-0 sweep against Bangladesh, Rohit admitted not being at his best as a captain during the embarrassing 0-3 whitewash against New Zealand.The Aussie pace battery of Michael Starc, captain Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood will, therefore, try to put Rohit under pressure, as have been Australia's tactics historically against the visiting captains.""Rohit Sharma may miss one or two Tests, but he is the captain, and Australia always tries to torpedo the visiting captain. It's been a tactic they've used forever, and I think they'll go very hard at Rohit Sharma,"" O'Keeffe told foxsports.com.au.Along with Rohit, India's other premier batsman, Virat Kohli, has been feeling the heat for a while because of his extended lean patch. In six Tests matches Kohli has played so far in 2024, he has scored just 250 runs in 12 innings at an average of 22.72, including a solitary half-century.O'Keeffe believes Australia should remain wary of the batsman in Kohli, who has been a thorn in the flesh for the Aussies over the years. He said Kohli's form could be one of the decisive factors of this BGT.""Kohli, who has worried them (Australia) over the years, what a stunning player he's been; but in sport, if you sense that the king of the jungle is slightly weaker, you poke a bit of cheek at him. I'm fascinated to see what Virat Kohli ends up with at the end of the summer. It could be the decisive point in the whole summer,"" he said.""If he has an absolutely blazing series, India could win.""The first Test begins on November 22 in Perth.","Rohit Sharma's availability for the first Test of the coming Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) is still uncertain.

Marco Jansen's 17-ball 54 gave India nervous moments during the defence of the total. But he eventually fell in the final over to alleviate any chance of a remarkable turnaround in outcome.Jansen top-scored for South Africa followed by Heinrich Klaasen's 22-ball 41. Aiden Markram, Reeza Hendricks and Ryan Rickelton had also chipped in with 29, 21 and 20 respectively at the top of the order.For India, Arshdeep Singh proved decisive to fend off South Africa's attempts, delivering with the new ball and at the fag end of the match.

He formed a crucial 107-run partnership with Abhishek for the second wicket, building a solid foundation after the early loss of Sanju Samson (0).Although Keshav Maharaj (2/36) slowed down the scoring during the middle overs, Tilak launched a late assault, scoring 52 runs off just 22 balls in the final six overs, ensuring India capitalized on their strong start.His explosive batting helped overshadow the struggles of skipper Suryakumar Yadav (1), Hardik Pandya (18), and Rinku Singh (8).Samson was dismissed for a second consecutive duck in this series after being beaten by low bounce from Marco Jansen, a stark contrast to his hundred in the series opener. However, India rebounded strongly this time, with Tilak and Abhishek taking full advantage of the pitch that offered good bounce and carry.Abhishek's quick-fire fifty provided a much-needed boost to the Indian side, as his ability to hit through the line after creating space proved effective.

Sri Lanka batters shine

Kusal Mendis and Avishka Fernando both slammed centuries to set up a convincing 45-run victory for Sri Lanka in the rain-interrupted first one-day international against New Zealand on Wednesday.Kusal, 29, struck a career-best 143 and Avishka hit 100 as Sri Lanka posted a commanding 324-5 in 49.2 overs before rain stopped play.New Zealand, chasing a revised target of 221 off 27 overs, were restricted to 175-9 in the day-night game played at Dambulla.The Kiwis started off confidently but then lost five wickets in less than five overs for the addition of just 22 runs.It was Maheesh Theekshana who triggered the collapse with the wickets of openers Will Young and Tim Robinson, who shared an 88-run stand off just 79 balls.Robinson fell to a sharp stumping by Kusal, and four balls later, Theekshana bowled Young to swing the momentum towards Sri Lanka.From there on, it was downhill all the way for the visitors as the rest of the batsmen failed to live up to the task.""When you lose two set guys, it can be difficult on these wickets,"" said Kiwi skipper Mitchell Santner.""We tried to keep firing shots, but if you lose wickets in clumps, it's a challenge.""Earlier, Kusal and Avishka stitched together a 206-run stand off 215 balls for the highest second-wicket partnership in ODIs for Sri Lanka against New Zealand.Their effort eclipsed a 21-year-old record held by Sanath Jayasuriya and Hashan Tillakaratne, who added 170 against the Black Caps in the 2003 World Cup in Bloemfontein.The stand was also the highest partnership for any wicket at Dambulla in ODIs.""I thought it will be tough for us (with the wet ball) and it also didn't turn too much,"" said Sri Lankan captain Charith Asalanka.""Avishka and Kusal batted really well and the best thing was that both of them scored hundreds.""For Avishka, it was his first century since 2021, breaking a dry spell after a string of low scores.Avishka's 115-ball knock, including nine fours and two sixes, came to an end when he was caught while attempting a sweep shot off Ish Sodhi.

This comes at the back of his performance in the Vinoo Mankad Trophy 2024-25 where he was the highest run-scorer with 492 runs in five games.But before him, southpaw Lomror anchored the innings after taking to the crease in the 10th over.

NAGPUR: A couple of fielding lapses and the rub of green going the other way undid the good work done by Vidarbha bowlers at VCA’s Jamtha Stadium on Wednesday.Gujarat , almost down and out at 150 for 6, made the most of the run of luck to finish Day 1 on 281 for 6 in 86 overs to keep the Elite Group ‘B’ Ranji Trophy match wide open.The first fielding lapse happened in the 9th over, when Gujarat were 10 for 2: Priyank Panchal edged a delivery from medium pacer Praful Hinge when on 9.Yash Rathod , standing at gully grassed a regulation catch. Then in the 43rd over, when Gujarat were 113 for 5: Vishal Jayswal , on 3 off 12 balls, whacked the ball with all his might towards the bowler.Off spinner Akshay Wakhare failed to react in time to the difficult caught and bowled chance as the tracer bullet raced to the straight boundary.Post the reprieve, Panchal (88;158b;9x4;2x6) went on to post his second fifty of the season. Jayswal, playing his second First Class match, posted his maiden century (110;125b;12x4;4x6) in the format. Together, the two brought Gujarat back into the game after they were pushed to a tight corner by Vidarbha bowlers.Panchal lived a charmed life on Wednesday. After the reprieve by Rathod, Vidarbha pacers not only beat Panchal often but also induced edges of his bat. Much to the despair of the hosts, though, the edges either fell short of the slip cordon or flew over them.Making the most of his good fortune, Panchal posted his fifty by lofting Wakhare over straight boundary for a six. A Praful Hinge yorker finally ended his innings.At the other end, Jayswal, after hitting a boundary on the ball on which he got a life, clobbered 11 more fours and fours sixes to finish Day 1 unbeaten on 110 off 125 balls. Jayswal used every variant of the sweep shot — conventional, fine and slog — as he battered Vidarbha's spin duo of Wakhare and Harsh Dubey At tea, Jayswal along with skipper Chintan Gaja had added 27 runs in 49 balls. Post the break, the two snatched the Day 1 honours from Vidarbha bowlers by remaining unbeaten for the entire third session.Their unfinished 131-run seventh wicket partnership, the highest of the day for Gujarat, has kept the game wide open. The scenario looked highly unlikely at one point as Vidarbha bowlers had reduced them to 151 for 6 inside the second session.Vidarbha opening bowlers were on the money in the morning session after putting Gujarat in to bat. Hinge sent back Aarya Desai (0;7b) while Aditya Thakare trapped Manan Hingrajia (1;20b) lbw as Gujarat laboured to 11 for 2 in 20 overs. In the 20th over, Hinge removed Umang Kumar (15;28b;1x4;1x6) as Gujarat reached lunch at 85 for 3.In the second session too, Vidarbha bowlers picked up three wickets. The rearguard action by Jayswal and Gaja (43;123b;7x4) though denied Vidarbha bowlers any breakthrough in the last session of the day.",Gujarat finish Day 1 on 281 for 6 in 86 overs to keep the Elite Group ‘B’ Ranji Trophy match wide open.

Tilak Varma admitted to feeling the pressure mounting on him and Abhishek Sharma before the third T20I against South Africa. He was thrilled to relieve that pressure with his maiden international century in Wednesday's match at SuperSport Park.Tilak's unbeaten 107 off 56 balls and Abhishek's quickfire 50 off 25 balls propelled India to a commanding total of 219 for six. This impressive performance marked a significant milestone for both young left-handers.Tilak's century also etched his name in the history books as the second youngest Indian to achieve this feat in T20Is, following in the footsteps of Yashasvi Jaiswal “I was waiting for this moment for a long time. Coming after injury and scoring a hundred…it is incredible. We (Abhishek and me) both were under pressure and this knock was important for both of us.”This match was not only special for Tilak's century but also marked a personal best for both openers. It was Tilak's first half-century in nine innings and Abhishek's first fifty in eight matches.Tilak acknowledged that the pitch at Centurion presented unique challenges, particularly at the start of their innings due to its unpredictable nature.“It was challenging at the start - wicket was two-paced. After that, it went well. I tried to hold my shape and was trying to focus on the basics. We talked about following the basics.”The Hyderabad batter, who became the 12th Indian to score a T20I century, expressed confidence in their team's ability to defend the substantial total.“Our spinners are bowling well.

On-air commentators confirmed that they were 'flying ants.'It is not uncommon for insects to halt play in South Africa, but the culprits in a match against Sri Lanka in 2017 were bees, who interrupted play for over an hour.Cricket South Africa posted on X, ""Play has been halted due to a small pest problem. 'Flying ants' are running amok at the stadium, so we will wait for them to disperse before resuming play.""The game was held up for half-an-hour and resumed at 11:10pm IST (7:40pm local time).Earlier, in the third T20 International at Centurion's SuperSport Park, Tilak Varma shone brightly, smashing an unbeaten century to propel India to an imposing 219/6 against South Africa.Promoted to number three, Varma grabbed the opportunity with a scintillating 107 off just 56 balls. This maiden T20I century marked him as the second youngest Indian and 12th overall from the nation to achieve this feat in men's T20Is.Walking in during the very first over, Varma faced a two-paced wicket with fearless aggression. He capitalised on every opportunity, sending the ball soaring for eight fours and seven sixes.Varma's innings was a masterclass in powerful hitting, with all 71 runs coming from boundaries on the leg side. His ability to pace the innings while showcasing breathtaking stroke-play was remarkable.Abhishek Sharma provided solid support with a brisk 25-ball fifty, ending his lean patch. Their 107-run partnership for the second wicket proved instrumental in shifting the momentum, effectively utilising the short boundaries during the powerplay.For South Africa, bowling duties were shared by Andile Simelane and Keshav Maharaj, each claiming two wickets. India, opting to bat first, faced an early setback as Sanju Samson was dismissed for consecutive golden ducks, undone by Jansen's subtle swing.However, Abhishek and Tilak combined brilliantly to wrest back control, putting South Africa on the defensive.Varma started his onslaught with a four and a six off Jansen. Abhishek, initially taking his time, then hammered Gerard Coetzee for two fours and a six in a high-scoring second over. Varma continued his assault on Lutho Sipamla, finding the boundary twice with a pull and a straight drive, while Sharma launched Simelane for two consecutive sixes. India ended the powerplay at a commanding 70/1.The boundaries kept flowing after the Powerplay. Sharma danced down the track to hit Aiden Markram for four, while Varma effortlessly reverse-swept him for six before hooking Coetzee for another maximum off a no-ball. Sharma continued his aggressive approach, dispatching Maharaj for a six, before reaching his fifty with a single.However, Maharaj struck back, trapping Sharma lbw, ending the impactful partnership. Suryakumar Yadav then fell prey to Simelane, caught at sweeper cover.Hardik Pandya, known for his elegant strokeplay, struck three boundaries before Maharaj trapped him lbw with a pinpoint straight delivery. Varma, having reached his fifty off a mere 32 balls, continued his onslaught, lofting Maharaj over extra cover for four and following it up with two more boundaries.Coetzee bore the brunt of Varma's aggression, conceding a six over long-on off an overpitched delivery. Varma then showcased his wristy brilliance, whipping another maximum over deep square leg and following it up with a boundary.Simelane returned to dismiss a struggling Rinku Singh. However, debutant Ramandeep Singh announced his arrival in style, smashing a six off his very first ball in international cricket before adding a wristy drive for four.Varma reached his century in 51 balls with a chipped drive past mid-off for four off Sipamla. He then added a scooped six over fine leg off a free-hit delivery.Although Ramandeep was run out in the final over, Varma's whirlwind knock ensured India finished with an imposing total.India 219/6 in 20 overs (Tilak Varma 107 not out, Abhishek Sharma 50; Andile Simelane 2-34, Keshav Maharaj 2-36) against South Africa","India vs South Africa 3rd T20I was delayed due to flying ants.

Unfinished business

Argentina and Brazil will have two of their leading stars available again as South American qualifying for the 2026 World Cup resumes with the last two rounds of games this year. Defending World Cup champion Argentina will once again count on goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez , who was suspended for two international matches in October. Brazil will bring back winger Vinicius Júnior , who missed the last two qualifiers through injury but has recovered.South American leaders Argentina will play at Paraguay on Thursday, shortly after fourth-place Brazil visits Venezuela.Also on Thursday, host Ecuador and Bolivia will face off in Guayaquil.Potentially the most interesting match of the 11th round will be played on Friday in Montevideo, where third-place Uruguay hosts second-place Colombia. The bottom two in the 10-team standings, Peru and Chile, will meet the same day.All teams play again next Tuesday in the 12th round of games, when Argentina hosts Peru and Brazil has a home game against Uruguay.Argentina currently has 22 points, three more than Colombia, with Uruguay and Brazil third and fourth with 16 points each. Ecuador and Paraguay, with 13 points, complete the top six which are direct spots in the next World Cup.Bolivia has 12 points, and its seventh place would qualify the Andean team for an international playoff. Venezuela (11), Peru (6) and Chile (5) complete the standings.Argentina can move even closer to a spot at the World Cup by beating Paraguay and Peru.Captain Lionel Messi will be his team's best hope for goals once again after his hat trick and two assists in the 6-0 win against Bolivia in October, with the 37-year-old the top scorer in the current South American qualifying.Argentina will travel to Asuncion with an additional challenge since Paraguay has been unbeaten since coach Gustavo Alfaro, an Argentine, took over in the middle of the year. In September, the Paraguayans beat Brazil 1-0.Coach Lionel Scaloni faced a last-minute injury that could force even more changes in Argentina's defense. Lisandro Martinez suffered an apparent abdomen injury during Manchester United's 3-0 Premier League victory over Leicester and was discharged from international duty. Scaloni had already lost Germán Pezzella.Pressure on Brazil coach Dorival Júnior was eased in October after two wins in qualifying over Chile and Peru. And Vinicius wasn't on duty in either of them.Fans will pay close attention to the winger's performances against tough defenses at Venezuela and later against Uruguay, as he tries to reproduce for Brazil the same decisive performances for Real Madrid.Brazil once again will not have Neymar, who picked up a muscular injury earlier this month. There's no big name as a center forward because Rodrygo is injured, too, and Endrick was not chosen. Vinicius will likely have to link up effectively with Raphinha and Luiz Henrique.Vinicius will face two teams that are in a degree of turmoil. Venezuela hasn't won any of its last six qualifiers, and Uruguay coach Marcelo Bielsa is still under fire from former players for his handling of the team.Two wins for Brazil won't secure the team a spot at the next World Cup just yet, but they will give fans and players some reassurance after a turbulent year.Colombia is hardly expecting a friendly reception in Montevideo on Friday. After all, there's unfinished business with Uruguay since their turbulent semifinal encounter at the Copa América in the United States in July.Colombia's victory kicked off a brawl between Colombian fans and relatives of the Uruguay players. Led by striker Darwin Núñez, the Uruguayans went into the stands to defend their relatives. Núnez was later suspended for five matches.Uruguay's Bielsa will be without two key midfielders, Nicolás de la Cruz and Giorgian de Arrascaeta, both injured. Uruguay has not won since its third-place match at the Copa America.","Argentina and Brazil will have two of their leading stars available again as South American qualifying resumes.

A new era begins at Manchester United as Ruben Amorim becomes the latest coach to take on the challenge of reviving the storied English club.After more than a decade of on-field decline the 20-time English champion has turned to a 39-year-old Portuguese who has delivered trophies and a thrilling style of soccer to Sporting Lisbon , but takes over a club that has made a habit of wrecking even the biggest reputations.High-caliber managers have come and gone, more than $1 billion has been spent on player signings, yet United just can't seem to get it right.""If anybody knew the answer (for that), we wouldn't have had the last 10, 11 years,"" Andy George, a 40-year-old United fan from Worcestershire, told The Associated Press. ""I always back the manager ... but it needs to work now.""George said he had been a supporter for 30 years and traveled around 100 miles (160 kilometers) for last week's 2-0 win against PAOK in the Europa League.Proven winner Amorim - a former Portugal international - was Lisbon coach from 2020 and ended its 19-year wait for the Portuguese title in 2021. He won it again in 2024 and his achievements led to links with jobs at Liverpool , Manchester City and Barcelona before he was hired to replaceErik ten Hag at the start of the month.""I'm not naive, I know that it's going to be very different, very tough,"" Amorim said Sunday after his final game with Sporting. ""But I feel that I'm ready. I'm at peace now, I can focus on my new job.""He is United's sixth permanent coach since club great Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 after winning his 13th Premier League title. Ferguson won 28 major trophies, including two Champions Leagues, and his record has cast a shadow over all of his successors.David Moyes was the first to try to step into his shoes, lasted eight months and began what has been a cycle of hiring, firing and reboots in an attempt to return the club to its past glories.Since then United has gone through Champions League winners (Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho), an iconic former player (Ole Gunnar Solskjaer) and one of Europe's emerging coaching talents (Ten Hag), but has not been able to stop City from dominating English soccer, while Liverpool, Chelsea and even Leicester have lifted the title in that time.High expectations United hopes Amorim will be the man to finally break the cycle.""We cannot ignore how he has changed Sporting,"" United midfielder Casemiro said Sunday. ""We know that Sporting won many titles, changed the club with titles, with trophies. He has already proved that he is a coach that has won a lot.""Amorim made a spectacular statement even before officially taking up his new role when, while serving out his notice at Lisbon, his team routed City 4-1 in the Champions League last week.""I was like, 'Oh, my gosh!' I lost my mind,"" said Joshua Hanley, a United fan from Kansas City who had flown to England to watch the PAOK game. ""We were changing airplanes and I'm sitting there kind of watching the score on my phone.""It was a fantastic start.""Amorim joked that he would be considered the new Ferguson if he beat City.Hanley's expectations are more modest to begin with.""If we can make top six, it would be a fantastic end of the season,"" he said, adding that he wants Amorim to ""make football exciting again"".New structure Amorim is the first head coach hired since British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe became a minority owner of United in February, assumed control of soccer operations and installed a new leadership team as part of his overhaul.Chief exectuive Omar Berrada was lured from City and sporting director Dan Ashworth came from Newcastle. Dave Brailsford, who helped Britain become a global force in cycling, is a director on United's soccer board.While Ten Hag was given a contract extension following an end of season review in the summer, he was appointed under a former regime. United's woeful start to the campaign - losing four of its opening nine league games - ultimately cost him.Amorim has the benefit of being chosen by United's new hierarchy and the final piece of leadership team assembled by Ratcliffe, which should afford him time implement his plans.Ambition Not that he is likely to get a free pass this season. The timing of the decision to fire Ten Hag could be considered instructive in terms of United's ambition.There have only been 11 rounds of the league campaign and Amorim takes over a team that, although 13th in the standings, is only four points off third place. It also remains in three cup competitions.Champions League qualification remains very much in play and after United spent around $230 million on transfers in the offseason, Amorim will be expected to quickly deliver winning soccer to a club that has been playing catchup for too long.In the long term, the challenge is to return United to the summit of English and European soccer - a task that has proved beyond any of his last five predecessors.",Ruben Amorim becomes Manchester United's sixth permanent coach since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.

The match witnessed an early goal from Hugo Boumous in the fourth minute, while Manvir Singh found the equaliser for the visitors in the 36th, keeping the spectators engaged throughout the 90 minutes.Mohun Bagan had the lion's share of possession (61%) and 11 corners to Odisha's nil, but they failed to convert those into goals as the Kalinga Warriors dug deep to soak in the pressure and charge on the counterattack. Couple of good attempts by former Bagan striker Roy Krishna and midfielder Lalthathanga Khawlhring, aka Puitea, for the hosts went abegging as the scoreline stayed level till the final whistle.The hosts, Odisha FC, drew first blood when their midfield maestro, Hugo Boumous, found the back of the net with a well-placed right-footed shot from close range. The goal came after a set-piece situation inside the box, with Ahmed Jahouh providing the assist with a fine touch. The ball took a deflection off a MBSG defender before nestling into the back of the net, leaving goalkeeper Vishal Kaith with no chance of making a save.Odisha FC's resolute defence, led by the towering presence of Mourtada Fall, stood tall against the fancied MBSG attack, which had scored 12 goals before this encounter. The young Odisha backline thwarted the visitors' attempts to find an equaliser, frustrating their potent attacking force.However, MBSG's persistent threat paid off when Manvir Singh restored parity for the Mariners. The winger's well-timed header from the centre of the box found the bottom-right corner, leaving Odisha goalkeeper Amrinder Singh helpless despite getting his hands to the ball. The assist came from the pivotal midfielder Dimitri Petratos, who delivered a precise cross following a corner kick. Saviour Gama, who had conceded the corner, was stationed on the goal line but could not prevent the header from crossing the line.The first half ended with the scores level at 1-1, setting the stage for an exciting second period. Both teams displayed resilience and determination, with Odisha backline standing firm against MBSG's relentless attacks, while the visitors' defence remained vigilant to thwart any potential threats from the hosts.In the end, the tie ended in a keenly-fought draw.While Odisha FC will be pleased with their defensive resilience after conceding 13 goals before this game, MBSG will rue their missed chances to secure all three points. With one point from their seventh game MBSG consolidated their second place on the league table with 14 points while Odisha remained on ninth spot with nine points after eight games.","Mohun Bagan Super Giant (MBSG) and Odisha FC (OFC) played out an enthralling 1-1 draw in Bhubaneswar on Sunday.
