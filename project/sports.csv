Cody Rhodes‚Äô reign as Undisputed WWE Champion came to a controversial end at WrestleMania 41. Facing a heel turned John Cena, Rhodes lost not just his title but also momentum in a match that saw outside interference from rapper Travis Scott. Cena, who aligned himself with The Rock en route to the event, capitalized on the chaos to win his 17th world title - overtaking Ric Flair's iconic record.For Rhodes, it was a heartbreaking loss that reversed his year-long journey as champion, which had begun with his triumphant win over Roman Reigns at WrestleMania 40.In the aftermath, WWE Hall of Famer Bubba Ray Dudley offered a surprising take: Cody shouldn‚Äôt return to WWE television right away. Speaking on Busted Open podcast , Dudley stressed the value of emotional build-up, suggesting that letting fans ‚Äúmiss‚Äù Cody for a while could make his comeback more impactful.""I would like to see them wait a while... Where's Cody Rhodes? We haven't heard from him?"" said Dudley. The comment quickly sparked debate online, with some agreeing that a brief hiatus might build anticipation.Cody‚Äôs notable absence on the Raw episode following WrestleMania only added to the intrigue. Instead, John Cena opened the show and was later ambushed by Randy Orton - shifting attention away from Rhodes. WWE has made no official statement about Cody‚Äôs status, further fueling questions about whether this silence is part of a storyline or something more.Some fans worry this could hint at a longer break or potential injury, though there is no confirmation of either.There may be hope for fans eager to see Cody back soon.

JJ Redick on Hachimura: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll keep wearing the mask‚Äù



Rui Hachimura‚Äôs playoff impact goes far beyond stat sheet





Playoff basketball doesn‚Äôt wait for anyone and neither did Rui Hachimura . On a night when every possession mattered, the Los Angeles Lakers leaned on grit, hustle, and a little bit of masked heroism to grind out a Game 2 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. After taking a shot to the face early in the game, Hachimura briefly exited the floor, only to return moments later with a black protective mask and a fire in his eyes. The Lakers fed off that energy and evened the series, 1-1, with a performance that was anything but ordinary.After the game, head coach JJ Redick didn‚Äôt dodge the obvious topic, Rui Hachimura‚Äôs unexpected new look. The forward‚Äôs return in a protective mask raised questions about the severity of the injury and what it meant moving forward. Redick reassured reporters that Hachimura is doing well but mentioned that the mask will likely stay on for now as a precautionary measure.It‚Äôs not the most comfortable solution, but it‚Äôs a smart one. Facial injuries can be unpredictable, and for someone like Hachimura who brings physicality on both ends of the floor, it makes sense to take extra care. The important part? He‚Äôs staying in the lineup, and his presence remains a big part of the Lakers' playoff plans.While his stat sheet against Minnesota hasn‚Äôt exactly turned heads, Rui Hachimura‚Äôs presence on the court tells a much bigger story. He brings a level of consistency and versatility that doesn‚Äôt always show up in the box score. During the regular season, he quietly averaged 13.1 points and 5 rebounds per game, while shooting an impressive 41.3% from beyond the arc, proof of his ability to stretch defenses and keep opposing bigs honest. Add to that his size and strength on defense, and you‚Äôve got a two-way player who can slide into multiple roles depending on the matchup.Also Read: Donovan Mitchell‚Äôs injury forces Cavs to think bigger than no. 1 seed And let‚Äôs not overlook his playoff pedigree. Hachimura has built a reputation for stepping up when it matters most. Whether it‚Äôs making timely shots, locking in defensively, or simply providing that calm, steady energy in chaotic moments, he has a knack for shining brightest under pressure. If the Lakers have any plans of making a deep postseason run, they‚Äôre going to need more of that clutch DNA, mask or no mask.",Rui Hachimura returned to the court in a protective mask after taking a shot to the face.

Commitment to the community of giving something back



Career achievements and steady growth



He was born in 1992 in Markham, Ontario. Jeff grew up in a hockey family, socializing with children around hockey. Before joining full-time hockey, he was a competitive figure skater and had even won a national bronze medal. Early exposure to sports honed his edge and shaped an equally unique style of play. Skinner had already started making news for his natural scoring ability by the time he came to join the Kitchener Rangers in the OHL.In 2010, he was the seventh overall pick in the NHL entry draft by the Carolina Hurricanes . His rookie campaign caused a stir just about immediately. He became the youngest player to ever play in an NHL All-Star Game and then won the Calder Memorial Trophy at the end of the year. His role grew further with time. He also matured into one of the most consistent left-wingers in the NHL. In the meantime, he moved to the Buffalo Sabres in 2018, still setting examples.Off the ice, Skinner keeps a relatively low profile. He previously dated Canadian actress Cristine Prosperi and is known for being a devoted dog owner. While he hasn't settled down with a family yet, his personal life reflects a calm, grounded energy. His love for animals and strong ties with his five siblings point to his supportive and caring nature. The family remains central, with multiple relatives also involved in hockey.While Skinner‚Äôs impact on the ice is clear, his efforts off the ice also speak volumes.

LeBron James details why NBA playoff game 3 will be crucial



NBA Playoffs Are a Different Game | LeBron James & Steve Nash | MIND THE GAME

The Los Angeles Lakers bounced back in the playoff game 2 with a stunning 94-85 win against the Minnesota Timberwolves at the Crypto.com arena. LeBron James , the standout star and Lakers veteran, has recently shared that game 3 in the playoffs is the most crucial for any team. In a candid chat with Steve Nash on the Mind The Game podcast, the duo discussed the shift in the gameplay in the playoffs, even James compared it to the Olympic games.LeBron James recently had a candid chat with former Lakers star Steve Nash on the Mind The Game podcast. While the duo discussed many NBA topics, their thoughts on the playoff game 3 for the Lakers revealed James‚Äô potential move. The Minnesota Timberwolves will be looking forward to adding another win to lead the series, while the Lakers‚Äô stance will also define their playoff run after their game 2 victory.‚ÄúThe physical intensity of the defense ‚Äî you‚Äôve seen them in the regular season, but if they‚Äôre going to blitz you in the playoffs, that is a different blitz,‚Äù Nash initiated the discussion. ‚ÄúThat is a different blitz. That is physical. That is hands. That is the body, feet ‚Äî everything taking away space,‚Äù he added.James hailed the playoff defense intensity while acknowledging the referees for allowing defensive heat a bit more than in the regular season. ‚ÄúThe referees allow it a little bit more, too. The refs allow it. And I love it. And I love when you can be more handsy, you can be more physical, and the whistle is not blown as frequently, right?‚Äù James said in the podcast.Does this mean James and the Lakers are looking to employ his defensive strategy more than their offense? Possibly. And there is a roster of capable players, including Luka Doncic and Austin Reaves, to aid him in clinching another win in the series with a blend of both offense and defense. Still, James, who is now 40 years old, finds it a bit difficult to catch up to the level of the intensity, at least with immediate effect.‚ÄúI actually like this. But I need a game or two to actually get to it. It takes a couple games. Because if you‚Äôve been training your body and playing a certain way for eight months, and then all of a sudden, within one week, you have to now go into the postseason where everything is more physical, everything is faster, everything is more intensified,‚Äù the Lakers legend shared.Certainly, there is a stark contrast in the regular season and the playoffs, as James puts it, ‚Äúlike playing in the NBA to now playing in the Olympics.‚ÄùGame 3 is scheduled for Thursday night (9:30 p.m. ET) in Memphis.Also Read: NBA Playoffs: Golden State Warriors saw crushing game 2 defeat against Houston Rockets after Jimmy Butler‚Äôs injury In game 2, Luka Doncic led the team with an impressive 31 points and also contributed significantly with 12 rebounds and 9 assists in his 42 minutes and 9 seconds on the court.

Shedeur Sanders faces harsh draft scrutiny amid polarizing NFL projections



As the 2025 NFL Draft is almost here, a rising storm of skepticism surrounds Shedeur Sanders , the quarterback once heralded as a top-three pick. Just days before the event in Green Bay, the narrative around the Colorado standout and son of Deion ""Coach Prime"" Sanders has taken a dramatic turn, with criticism mounting from all corners of the league.Despite reports that the Pittsburgh Steelers and a few other teams have expressed interest, Shedeur‚Äôs draft process has been anything but smooth. In recent weeks, a wave of brutally honest assessments from NFL insiders has cast a shadow over his immediate future in the league.NFL Network‚Äôs Tom Pelissero shared a particularly jarring collection of quotes that have raised eyebrows across the scouting community. One assistant coach didn‚Äôt hold back, stating: ""The worst formal interview I've ever been in in my life. He's so entitled. He takes unnecessary sacks. He never plays on time. He has horrible body language. He blames teammates. ... But the biggest thing is, he's not that good."" That statement alone paints a picture of a player whose talent is being overshadowed by concerns about maturity and leadership.Another red flag came from an AFC executive who highlighted Shedeur‚Äôs apparent inflexibility during team interviews: ""It didn't go great in our interview. He wants to dictate what he's going to do and what's best for him. He makes you feel small."" Such remarks hint at deeper issues that could affect his locker room presence‚Äîan intangible yet vital aspect of a quarterback's role.Adding to the scrutiny, a general manager remarked that Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart had far more impressive game tape. This view was echoed by an NFC GM who recalled liking Sanders a year prior but noted a steep drop-off: ""They did change coordinators. It just felt different. It felt less athletic, less arm talent -- everything felt less."" That sentiment encapsulates a broader disappointment with Sanders‚Äô 2024 performance.The harshest blow, perhaps, came from an NFC quarterbacks coach quoted by Albert Breer of Sports Illustrated: ""This guy‚Äîif his last name was Breer‚Äîand he was coming out of Minnesota, he'd be a sixth-round pick. He doesn't play with good feet, he's late on stuff, he has an average arm. His accuracy is O.K., but he has no timing, no anticipation."" The coach also called out his underwhelming pro day performance, noting the absence of rhythm and precision expected at the NFL level.Still, some conflicting reports have cast doubt on just how poorly his interview with the Steelers truly went, suggesting the full story may not be as clear-cut as some believe.Once projected as a top-tier selection, Sanders may now find himself slipping into the later stages of the first round‚Äîpossibly even beyond the 20th pick. Yet, in a draft class loaded with potential but thin on proven quarterbacks, his name may still carry weight. The question is: will it be enough to overshadow the growing doubts?For now, Shedeur Sanders remains one of the most polarizing prospects entering the draft. Whether he becomes a first-round steal or a cautionary tale will be decided not by his last name, but by how he handles the scrutiny and what he delivers on the field.Also Read: Who is Mel Owens?

Cam Ward drafted No. 1: Why the pressure is now on Tennessee Titans coach Brian Callahan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/cam-ward-drafted-no-1-why-the-pressure-is-now-on-tennessee-titans-coach-brian-callahan/articleshow/120604069.cms,"Photo by Joshua Applegate/Getty Images

Why the Tennessee Titans' faith in Cam Ward could define Brian Callahan‚Äôs coaching legacy

his

The Tennessee Titans didn‚Äôt just select a quarterback with the No. 1 overall pick‚Äîthey selected an identity. In choosing Miami‚Äôs Cam Ward , they handed the keys to their franchise not only to a promising young passer but also to a head coach with everything to prove. Brian Callahan ‚Äôs first year in Tennessee was marked by brutal sideline honesty, especially when it came to Will Levis . Now, with his chosen quarterback leading the charge, Callahan steps into the biggest challenge of his coaching career.In 2024, Brian Callahan‚Äôs sideline interactions with Will Levis often went viral‚Äîand not in a good way. A now-infamous sideline exchange saw Callahan stride over to Levis and, with visible frustration, demand an explanation: ‚ÄúHey, what the f--- are you doing?‚Äù After a Week 2 loss to the Jets, Callahan didn‚Äôt hold back: ‚ÄúIt was dumb. It was the same exact thing he did last week, and he cost us points in the red zone. ‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs a grown-up and he knows better, and so I was really irritated that he cost us three points in a game that we probably needed it.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs easy to see why Callahan, inheriting Levis and lacking long-term investment, may have felt freer to vent his frustrations. But that leeway disappears with Cam Ward . This time, it‚Äôs different. The Titans didn‚Äôt stumble into Ward‚Äîthey went all in.Ward isn‚Äôt the polished product Joe Burrow was, but he‚Äôs no reckless gunslinger either. He has moments‚Äîlike a wild cross-body pick against Florida‚Äîthat demand refinement. But he also flashes tantalizing tools: a big arm, creative footwork, and mobility shaped in the Mahomes era. Ward was 14 when Patrick Mahomes entered the league, and it shows.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a quarterback who seems to be possibly good enough ‚Ä¶ if the offense that‚Äôs built for him is good enough.‚ÄùAlso Read: Who‚Äôs attending the 2025 NFL Draft? See all 17 confirmed prospects This pick is about more than just throwing touchdowns. It‚Äôs about building something sustainable‚Äîan offense, a culture, a future worth selling to fans before a new stadium opens in 2027. And now, for Brian Callahan, there are no scapegoats. Cam Ward isguy. And how far Ward goes will ultimately decide how long Callahan stays.","Tennessee Titans head coach Brian Callahan's first year was marked by brutal sideline honesty, especially when it came to Will Levis.

'It‚Äôs a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee ‚Äî Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match ‚Äî before the Nagpur ODI ‚Äî more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‚ÄòHitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru finally treated their home fans to a victory, defeating Rajasthan Royals by eleven runs in Match forty‚Äëtwo of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium .Coming into Thursday night, Virat Kohli had four fifties in the campaign. At a fickle Chinnaswamy, he kept stalling in the thirties. That changed in emphatic style as the former skipper produced a 42‚Äëball 70 that married restraint with sudden violence.After losing yet another toss, RCB were asked to bat, and the first two overs hinted at nerves: Jofra Archer‚Äôs 149‚Äëkph bumper flew for four, and Phil Salt survived a sitter in the deep.Kohli first fed on Tushar Deshpande‚Äôs gentle pace, stroking two boundaries in the fifth over to ensure the powerplay closed at a healthy 59 without loss.The right‚Äëhander reached fifty in 32 balls, his first home half‚Äëcentury of the season, by pinging Sandeep Sharma for back‚Äëto‚Äëback fours, a wrists‚Äëwhip through mid‚Äëwicket followed by a classical punch past cover.Padikkal‚Äôs own 50 from 27 balls kept the pressure on Rajasthan‚Äôs bowlers, and late cameos from Tim David (23 off 15) and Jitesh Sharma (20* off 10) converted the solid platform into a final score of 205/5.Rajasthan‚Äôs response began explosively. Yashasvi Jaiswal whipped and lofted his way to 49 from 19 balls, dragging the chase to 72/1 after 6 overs. Krunal Pandya‚Äôs clever slow‚Äëarm spin nipped out skipper Riyan Parag and Nitish Rana, yet Dhruv Jurel kept the Royals alive with an inventive 47.When Shubham Dubey carved Yash Dayal for two boundaries, the equation fell to 18 required from 12 deliveries, placing the match on a knife‚Äëedge.Enter Hazlewood.The Australian quick had been expensive early, conceding 26 from his first two overs, but his last two overs rewrote the script.In over seventeen he allowed only six runs, leaving himself one over in the bank.He returned for the nineteenth with Rajasthan on 188/7.His final over read: single, dot, wicket, wicket, dot, dot. The first ball, a full‚Äëtoss, yielded a scrambled single to long off.The second, a slow bouncer, hurried Jurel. Ball three was a pinpoint yorker that brushed Jurel‚Äôs bat on its way to Jitesh Sharma‚Äôs gloves.Ball four, a hip‚Äëhigh cutter, forced a top‚Äëedge from Jofra Archer to cover. Two dots to Wanindu Hasaranga completed an over worth only one run and two wickets.Hazlewood‚Äôs spell closed at four overs, thirty‚Äëthree runs, four wickets; his final twelve deliveries cost seven.With seventeen still needed, Yash Dayal repeated last season‚Äôs heroics, mixing yorkers and slower balls to concede only six in the twentieth.Rajasthan finished on 194/9. Kohli‚Äôs calm and Hazlewood‚Äôs clutch combined to lift Bengaluru to twelve points and third place, while the Royals stayed marooned in eighth, their playoff hopes fading fast.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Rajasthan Royals by eleven runs.

Islamabad United:

New Zealand cricketer Colin Munro on Wednesday has sparked a heated debate in the ongoing Pakistan Super League (PSL).Munro, who is playing for Islamabad United has accused Multan Sultans ' all-rounder Iftikhar Ahmed for chucking.The drama unfolded in the 10th over of the match, when they were cruising to the target of 169 set by the Multan Sultans.Off-spinner Iftikhar Ahmed bowled a faster one in the blockhole and Munro somehow managed to dug it out. Just after the delivery, Munro gestured at the Iftikhar that he was chucking. Munro even bent his elbow while mimicking the action.Munro's gesture riled up the bowler Iftikhar Ahmed, who waked straight to one of the umpires to have a word with them. The entire Multan Sultan team also got involved. The umpires managed to diffuse the situation.Despite all this drama, defending champions Islamabad United continued their winning streak with a fifth consecutive win. Islamabad United chased the 169-run target set by Sultans with 17 balls to spare, banking on opening batter Andries Gous‚Äô 80 not out inclusive of six fours and five maximums.Gous, who faced 45 balls to register his maiden HBL PSL half-century, lost his opening partner Sahibzada Farhan in the third over after the duo had put on 29 runs in pursuit of the target. No.3 batter Colin Munro walked in all guns blazing as he stitched a fiery 81-run partnership for the second wicket off 48 balls.Munro contributed a 28-ball 45 to the cause hitting five fours and two sixes. After Michael Bracewell removed Munro in 11th over, Mohammad Nawaz (21 off 19b, 1x4, 1x6) and Gous steered their team closer to the target with a 55-run third-wicket stand.Earlier, Multan Sultans elected to bat first after winning the toss and their opening batters Mohammad Rizwan (36 off 37b, 3x4s) and Yasir Khan (29 off 17b, 2x4s, 2x6s) put on a solid 51-run stand off 6.4 overs.After Mohammad Nawaz drew the first blood for United dismissing Yasir, Usman Khan walked in and hit the ground running with a 29-ball half-century.

In an unusual incident during Wednesday's IPL match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Mumbai Indians , SRH wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan walked off after a delivery from Deepak Chahar despite no apparent contact between bat and ball, leading to his dismissal amid their batting collapse in Hyderabad.The left-handed Kishan, who had just scored his first run in the previous over, attempted to play a delivery from Chahar that was drifting down the leg side.MI wicketkeeper Ryan Rickelton collected the ball, but neither he nor the bowler appealed for a caught behind. On-field umpire Vinod Seshan was about to signal a wide.Unexpectedly, Kishan walked away, indicating he had edged the ball to the keeper, prompting Seshan to raise his finger for the dismissal.MI captain Hardik Pandya, who had made a half-hearted appeal, appreciated Kishan's gesture by patting him on his helmet and shoulders.Replay analysis revealed no contact between bat and ball, with UltraEdge showing no spike as the ball passed the left-hander's bat.While batters typically know when they've edged the ball, the decision was particularly significant given SRH's ninth position on the points table and the favorable batting conditions. Kishan's dismissal left SRH struggling at 9/2 in the third over.""You think you have seen it all after all these years and yet I must admit the Ishan Kishan's dismissal leaves me perplexed,"" commented Harsha Bhogle on X, expressing his surprise at the incident.","SRH wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan walked off after a delivery from Deepak Chahar despite no apparent contact between bat and ball.

That made me really happy.‚ÄùIt had long been a dream of Wadhera‚Äôs to speak with Kohli‚Äîsomething he‚Äôd often mentioned during his time with Mumbai Indians. ‚ÄúTill last year, I used to tell Tilak (Varma) or Surya bhai (Suryakumar Yadav) that I wanted to talk to Virat bhai once. That was the real ice-breaker‚Äîrealising that he actually knows me‚Äîand it gave me the confidence to speak to him.‚ÄùAfter the match, Wadhera approached Kohli for feedback. ‚ÄúAs soon as the match got over, I asked, ‚ÄòVirat bhai, you‚Äôve seen me for the past two years. Do you see any improvement in my game?‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòNehal, I liked your batting.‚Äô I explained my game plan, and he said my approach was smart, especially in a low-scoring game.He told me he saw composure and intent in my shots.‚Äù Needless to say, praise from a cricketing legend had a huge impact. ‚ÄúHe was happy to see my preparation and execution. I was just as happy to receive such feedback from someone like him.‚ÄùWadhera also acknowledged the mentorship of India‚Äôs 2011 World Cup hero, Yuvraj Singh . ‚ÄúHis words were golden. He gave me tips on how to take my game to the next level. I have huge respect for him.‚Äù In seven matches this IPL, Wadhera has scored 189 runs at an average of 37.80 and a strike rate of 146.51.His unbeaten 43 off 25 balls helped Punjab Kings chase down 172 against Lucknow Super Giants, and in a rain-affected 14-over match against RCB, his 19-ball 33* helped the team recover from 53 for four to seal a tricky 96-run chase. ‚ÄúI love playing in tough situations. I believe if you can win those, you‚Äôre ready for India,‚Äù he said.","Nehal Wadhera was left stunned when Virat Kohli recognized him by name.
