“Arindatri Cheygirparkku Allaal Vinaidhaan







Sirandhaanendru Evearpaart Randru.”

Sheryl Sandberg once wrote about an incident from her early days at Facebook. There was a floor reserved exclusively for directors, where there were no restrooms for women. Not because anyone opposed the idea — but because no one had imagined a woman would rise to that level. It was not hostility, but the soft silence of assumption. This, in essence, is how unconscious bias operates: quietly, invisibly, and often without intent.It is far more pervasive than open prejudice. It does not walk in announcing itself; it seeps into our choices disguised as instinct.Some of the most damaging kinds of favouritism is almost innocent — the kind that arises from unconscious bias. No doors are slammed. No words are spoken. Yet someone is quietly not considered or included. To the decision-maker, it may even feel perfectly fair.I was reminded of this recently during my visit to Sydney, where I addressed a warm and vibrant Tamil gathering. As soon as the programme ended, I rushed to the airport in the same attire I had worn on stage — my favourite sari, a, and slippers without heels. The organisers had booked me in business class, and check-in went smoothly.At the gate, an airline employee took one glance at me and directed me towards the economy class without checking my boarding pass. Only at the aircraft door did another crew member gently redirect me. I did not need to ask why. My profile — a South Indian woman travelling alone, in traditional attire with an unbranded handbag — simply didn’t match her mental picture of a business class passenger. I recall Sudha Murthy narrating a similar experience. She was waiting to board an international flight in the business class passenger line. She was dressed simply, and a couple of fellow women passengers behind her asked her to switch to the economy queue. They felt that they are rendering a helping hand to a passenger!The Sydney airport incident did not offend me. But it made me think. If these assumptions exist in others, do any such layers lie quietly within us too?Remnants of bias are in all of us — carried through culture, upbringing, fears.A recent incident involving actor Gauri Kishan revealed how deeply unconscious bias prevails. At a film press meet, a YouTuber casually asked the hero, “What was the heroine’s weight when you lifted her for that shot?” Gauri immediately objected, but a few reporters kept interrupting her, determined to drown her voice, defending the question.In their world of beliefs, such questions about women were normal — even acceptable. It would never occur to them to treat a man in the same way. Their confidence came from conditioning not cruelty. That is the quiet danger of unconscious bias: it makes the unreasonable appear reasonable.In workplaces, this bias influences hiring, promotions, and leadership opportunities. Organizations need inclusive policies and continuous reflection to ensure fair treatment and equity in preparing the floor for all employees to raise to their potential.Thiruvalluvar’s chapter Therindhu Vinayaadal – Art of Right Choice – is as good as an HR hiring guidebook especially couplet 515:Make competence the basis of your choice — not thePreferences or partialities of the hirer.Unconscious bias whispers: favouritism follows. To hear that whisper, and question it, is the first step towards a fairer world — one where ability shines sans prejudices.","Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text.

An open letter from Gen Z: Are we really the problem or just the mirror no one wants to look into?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/an-open-letter-from-a-gen-z-are-we-really-the-problem-or-just-the-mirror-no-one-wants-to-look-into/articleshow/125484214.cms,".

We didn’t create the world we’re growing up in







A moment of honesty from the other side

The office gap



Too sensitive? No. Emotional intelligence



Gen Z protests: Dancing, reels, but still historic



All we really want is to be heard



A final thought



To the generations that raised us, taught us, and now often critique us—consider this an open letter. Not a fight, not a manifesto, but a Gen Z’er trying to bridge a widening gap. Because for a group often labeled “chronically online,” “entitled,” or “too sensitive,” it’s ironic how rarely we’re truly heard.We’re told we don’t understand “how the world works.” But we’re living in it too—just on a timeline shaped by decisions made long before we arrived. So here’s a little context from our side.One of the biggest misconceptions about us—call it confusion or plain bias—is that older generations still mistake what they see as a “trend,” an “aesthetic,” or a set of quirks for the entirety of who we are. To many, Gen Z becomes oversized hoodies, matcha cravings, curly hair, performative identities, and Instagram slang. But we are a generation, as real as Millennials, Gen X, or Baby Boomers—the difference is how quickly we’re reduced to stereotype.What’s interesting is how many Gen Zers feel pressured to distance themselves from the label. As Yash Sonkar, a fellow Gen Z, puts it:“We’re into old Bollywood,”“We don’t use that killer grammar,”or “We’re not that online,”as if listening to Kishore Kumar somehow erases the year you were born.The truth is, we’ll hype Travis Scott and Hanumankind and just as easily switch to old classics. That duality is exactly what defines us. But it also raises a bigger question: while we’re open enough to understand and accept others’ choices and identities, is the other side equally willing to understand ours—without prejudice or preconceived notions?Your childhoods may have been slower and clearer. Ours began with constant comparisons, nonstop information, and pressure from day one.The world felt simpler then because it was smaller. Ours is loud, global, fast, and demanding—rarely pausing long enough for us to breathe. Natasha Singh , a millennial colleague, puts it this way, “Gen Z has an over-dependency on ChatGPT. Their constant need to label everything—including themselves—is frustrating for a generation that worked hard to break these labels.”But for us, labels aren’t cages—they’re clarity. They help us articulate identities in a world that often tries to overwrite them. And our use of tools like ChatGPT isn’t dependency; it’s adaptation.Another stereotype is that Gen Z is glued to screens, incapable of real connection. But ours was the first childhood lived online. Social media wasn’t a distraction—it was infrastructure. Community-building simply took a new shape.And here’s the part often ignored: older generations are on their phones just as much. The difference is that we grew up with these tools; you adopted them later. If smartphones existed when you were teens, you’d have been immersed too.Despite assumptions, many Gen Zers crave real-world connection deeply. We’re the ones reviving community gardens, co-working spaces, bookstores, and mutual aid networks. We’re not avoiding connection—we’re redefining it.A senior journalist from Generation X shared something with me that genuinely stayed with me. He said: “My daughter was born in 2004, so what makes me envious of Gen Z is the confidence with which they carry themselves. I see in my daughter many things I wanted to do—dreamed of—but never dared to when I was her age.”He sees in Gen Z a kind of fearlessness—an evolved, headstrong energy that earlier generations often had to suppress in the name of “discipline” or “fitting in.”He then added, almost reluctantly, “What worries me is when they act without thinking of the consequences. It’s good many times, but it can be dangerous on some occasions.”For him, these traits are undeniable strengths—but like all strengths, they can become risky when they aren’t guided by direction or awareness.If there’s one place where the generational rift is loudest, it’s the workplace.Many of us are seen as impatient, but the world we enter is nothing like the one you did. Entry-level salaries don’t match living costs, and traditional hierarchies often feel outdated. When we ask questions, we’re not being disrespectful—we’re trying to understand systems that no longer make sense.What’s ironic is hearing “I hate Gen Z” from people who spend all day copying Gen Z slang and trends—sometimes even Gen Z themselves.At the same time, not everyone sees us through a negative lens. Aashish Saxena, also a millennial, offers a refreshing perspective “Gen Z’s focus on work-life balance and mental health is wrongly , seen as laziness. I’ve found them to be highly efficient—they work smarter, and with the right motivation, are extremely enthusiastic. Their work ethic is simply different from the traditional hustle mindset.”Yet more worrying is how often HR professionals now say they “don’t want to hire Gen Z.” Not because of competence, but because of stereotypes. It sends a damaging message: an entire generation dismissed before they even step in.Some older workers see exhaustion as dedication. We see it as a red flag. We’ve watched generations burn out chasing stability that never came. So yes—we talk about mental health and set boundaries. It’s not rebellion; it’s survival.A recent video of Ananya Pandey went viral when a host claimed Gen Z is “traumatised by everything.” She responded instantly, “No, they’re not. They’re the first generation that’s actually talking about their feelings.”We’re often told we “can’t take criticism,” that we’re fragile or overly emotional. But what some call sensitivity is simply our refusal to swallow pain silently. Many of you grew up in homes where emotional expression was discouraged. We’ve seen how that legacy plays out—intergenerational trauma, unresolved anger, families that love deeply but communicate poorly.Across the world—including in Nepal—Gen Z has led protests demanding change on issues from corruption to climate. Some dismissed these movements as “unserious” because participants danced or made reels, but the impact was undeniable. These protests challenged laws, pushed policies, and sparked conversations that would have otherwise stayed stagnant.We know you’ve lived through things we can’t fully imagine—economic instability, political restrictions, fewer choices. We respect the resilience that shaped you. We admire the strength it took to build the foundation we stand on.But our battles aren’t smaller. They’re just different.We don’t want blind agreement—we want empathetic listening. We want guidance that respects individuality. We want space to evolve without feeling like we’re disappointing you. And we want understanding to flow both ways—not just from age to youth, but from experience to perspective.Older generations often say, “You’ll understand when you’re older.” Maybe we will. But understanding can’t be a one-way street. If age brings wisdom, youth brings perspective—and society needs both.So here we are, extending a hand. Because the truth is, we admire you more than you think. We’re shaped by your stories, your lessons, your resilience. But we also need you to acknowledge ours.","Gen Z is a generation often labeled “chronically online,” “entitled,’ or “too sensitive.” To many, Gen Z becomes oversized hoodies, matcha cravings, curly hair, performative identities, and Instagram slang. Despite assumptions, many Gen Zers crave real-world connection deeply.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125485016,imgsize-679889,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-4.jpg"

Delhi Student Suicide Case: Massive Protest Outside School After Note Alleges Harassment By Teachers

NEW DELHI: Four teachers of St Columba's School, named in an FIR filed in connection with the suicide by Class X student Shourya Patil (16), were on Thursday suspended.""The matter is under investigation... In view of the seriousness of the allegations, the competent authority has decided to place you under suspension with immediate effect,"" the order said, adding the teachers ""must stay available for official communication, avoid visiting the school or interacting with students, staff or parents without written permission"".Shourya's family returned for his last rites to Sangli, Maharashtra, where his grandparents live. He was cremated at his ancestral village, Dhawaleshwar, in Vita tehsil.Speaking to TOI on the phone, Shourya's father, Pradip Patil, said: ""For the past six months, he kept telling us he was being singled out and targeted even for normal conversations, and that teachers were humiliating him. We were repeatedly called to school over very small issues, especially in the past four months.""Also read: How 'warning' over dance practice pushed St Columba's Class 10 student to the brink Days before the school vacations, Shourya had pleaded with his father to pull him out.

After that, he only had to come for his pre-boards. We had assured him that once this was over, we would shift him to another school for the next two years.Because 20 internal marks are with the school, we didn't want to risk his board performance.

Copies of Shourya's handwritten suicide note were pasted outside the school gates and boundary walls, drawing crowds of parents who stopped to read his final words.Chandrashil Dhawan (35), a relative of the Patils at the protest, said, ""Several children have now told us they faced harassment from the same teachers.

""The next we heard,"" Dhawan said, ""was that he had jumped from the metro station.""Parents at the protest said the school's counsellors exist ""only on paper"" and students do not feel safe approaching them. Former students said the school must end what they described as a ""pick-and-point culture"" that singles out students repeatedly. Aditya Sagar (18), an alumnus, said, ""The school has counsellors, but students rarely approach them about teacher-related issues. They are all part of the same ecosystem, so it doesn't feel like a safe space to complain. ""A police team visited the school and interacted with the students.

How “Tweaker” Became a Cultural Phenomenon

GELO - Tweaker (Official Video)

Tweaker 's Chart Domination and Viral Impact on Fans

How LiAngelo Ball Went From Basketball to Music Trailblazer

LiAngelo Ball’s transformation from overlooked basketball prospect to music industry headliner has officially reached a historic milestone. His debut single “Tweaker,” released under the stage name Gelo, has achieved platinum status - an achievement that puts him in the same conversation as heavyweight artists like Drake . For an athlete-turned-musician, this level of success is both unprecedented and culturally significant, signaling a genuine crossover moment that few have ever achieved.In addition to redefining LiAngelo's public persona, this achievement represents the pinnacle of a swift ascent that started in early 2025. LiAngelo, a musician who was frequently overshadowed by his brothers Lonzo and LaMelo Ball, has carved out a whole new path, demonstrating that his musical drive and artistic intuition were much more than a curiosity.Released in January 2025, “Tweaker” exploded online almost instantly. Its nostalgic, bouncy beat - powered by piano, organ keys, and lush synth pads - captured the spirit of early-2000s hip-hop. Paired with Gelo’s melodic, sing-song delivery and a catchy “whoa” hook reminiscent of Big Tymers-era anthems, the track resonated widely. Produced by Kunica and Glockie Cheez, the song painted a picture of luxury, swagger, and newfound fame, creating an irresistible vibe that appealed to both younger listeners and fans of classic hip-hop aesthetics.Its momentum grew even stronger as the song spread into sports culture. NBA and NFL teams, including the Detroit Lions, Chicago Bulls, and Cleveland Cavaliers, embraced “Tweaker” as a celebratory anthem in locker rooms and warm-up sessions, pushing its reach far beyond the usual music circles.The success of “Tweaker” eventually led to a massive $13 million record deal with Def Jam and Universal Music Group. The contract included an extraordinary $8 million guaranteed signing bonus—more than what many current NBA players earn annually. This landmark deal solidified Gelo’s credibility and marketability within the hip-hop and R&B world.Adding even more momentum, a high-profile remix featuring Lil Wayne elevated the track’s status, giving it a stamp of approval from one of rap’s most influential figures.“Tweaker” made history by reaching No. 1 on the US Rhythmic Billboard chart - an exceptional feat for a debut single from a former basketball player. The song sparked viral dance trends across social platforms and earned praise from artists like T-Pain, Lil Yachty, and Joe Budden. Its appeal spanned music, sports, and online culture, cementing LiAngelo Ball as 2025’s breakout music star.Before rising to prominence in the music industry, LiAngelo Ball spent years navigating the NBA G-League and international basketball leagues. Eventually, he gave up the sport entirely, a decision that was validated by his outstanding achievements. His debut album League of My Own, which was released in July 2025, showcased his growth as a musician and cemented his place in the industry.Also read: Angel Reese responds with 4-word message after her name is dragged into viral NBA courtside altercation LiAngelo Ball’s platinum achievement for “Tweaker” is more than a win for himself - it is a defining cultural moment.

Candace Owens explains the roles of Tyler Robinson and Lance Twiggs



Operation Mocking-Plane: The Charlie Kirk Plot Thickens. | Candace Ep 266





Candace Owens claims the story about the day Charlie Kirk was shot does not make sense to her. She shared her thoughts during Myron Gaines’ livestream, which was uploaded to YouTube on November 18, 2025. Owens said she has been looking into the case on her own, and from what she has seen, the clips and details shown to the public feel incomplete. She pointed out that the public has not seen the exact moment when the shot was fired, and only a short clip of a person running after the shooting was released.Owens also said that Tyler Robinson, the man accused of shooting Charlie Kirk, may not have played the role many people think. She claimed that his fingerprints were found on the gun but said they were not the only fingerprints present. She also said another person named Lance Twiggs might have had a bigger role that day. Candace Owens stressed that these are her claims based on what she has seen so far.During the livestream, Candace Owens explained what she believed what happened on the day Charlie Kirk was shot. She said she thinks the whole situation looked like a planned setup with many people involved, not just one person acting alone.Myron Gaines asked her why she thought the story felt wrong, and she said there were gaps that did not add up.Candace Owens said that in her view, Tyler Robinson’s only real link to the case was that his fingerprints were found on the gun. She said his prints were not the only prints and claimed that this detail was not openly talked about.She also said that she does not believe Robinson stepped onto the campus that day. According to her, his “job” was only to pick up clothes and drop them near a Dairy Queen and then near a cemetery.She then discussed Lance Twiggs, who she said was the partner of the accused shooter. Candace Owens claimed Lance Twiggs was “much more involved.” She said she did not think he fired the shot, but she believed he had a deeper part in the plan too.Candace Owens also pointed to a TMZ video from September 13. The video showed a person walking toward Utah Valley University hours before the Charlie Kirk shooting. The person wore a maroon shirt, black cap, light shorts, and sneakers. Owens said this person was not Robinson but Lance Twiggs. She said the body in the video did not match Robinson and used this to support her claim that different people had different roles.Candace Owens said these details made her believe the Charlie Kirk shooting used patsies who were each given small tasks so the plan looked bigger and more confusing.Also Read: Candace Owens Brings Attention To YouTuber Claim Of TPUSA Financial Delay Before Charlie Kirk Shooting","Candace Owens claims the story about the day Charlie Kirk was shot does not make sense to her.

Taylor Swift’s ‘The Fate of Ophelia’ has fans convinced she’s revisiting her Joe Alwyn breakup — making clear it’s not about Travis Kelce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/taylor-swifts-the-fate-of-ophelia-has-fans-convinced-shes-revisiting-her-joe-alwyn-breakup-making-clear-its-not-about-travis-kelce/articleshow/125346377.cms,"Taylor Swift's new song, 'The Fate of Ophelia,' is fueling fan theories linking it to her breakup with Joe Alwyn. Swifties interpret lyrics about rescue and rebirth as a nod to her current relationship, contrasting it with her past. The track is seen as Taylor Swift reclaiming her narrative, transforming heartbreak into art.

Swifties think Taylor Swift’s ‘The Fate of Ophelia’ is aimed directly at Joe Alwyn

More coverage on NFL:

Taylor Swift’s latest track, “The Fate of Ophelia,” is sparking a fresh wave of online theories and Swifties are convinced she’s weaving real-life heartbreak into a Shakespeare-inspired narrative. The song, featured on The Life of a Showgirl, flips the tragic Ophelia storyline into one of revival, and fans immediately tie the imagery to Taylor’s emotional journey after her six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn.With the lyrics that feel pointed, timing that feels deliberate, and symbolism that leans heavily into themes of rescue, rebirth, and choosing a new path, this track has become the latest cultural flashpoint as listeners dissect what Taylor may be saying between the lines..Swifties didn’t waste time pulling receipts. The lyric “dug me out of my grave” is being hailed as a symbolic nod to Travis, the man fans believe helped lift Taylor from the emotional stagnation she experienced during her long romance with Joe. And the shade? It’s there in sharpened form.When Taylor Swift sings, “All that time, I sat alone in my tower / You were just honing your powers,” listeners immediately connected it to Joe’s famously private lifestyle and his recent role in a new Hamlet film.The overlap between Ophelia, Hamlet, and Taylor’s real-life history is simply too on-the-nose for fans to ignore.What makes the moment hit even harder is how openly Swift seems to be reclaiming her narrative. Rather than turning her breakup into bitterness, she’s framing it as the final chapter of a darker era, one that allowed her to rise stronger and choose a love that fits her world rather than hides from it.Joe Alwyn, for his part, has subtly signaled he’s over the conversation, reportedly saying he’s moved on and suggesting fans do the same. But Swifties aren’t budging it..For Swift, this track feels like a mic-drop: a poetic goodbye to the past, a wink at the present, and a reminder that she’ll always turn heartbreak into art, even if some people would prefer not to be name-checked in her mythology..","Swifties interpret lyrics about rescue and rebirth as a nod to her current relationship, contrasting it with her past.

Jake Paul’s “ready to die” stance fuels the buildup



Anthony Joshua’s Usyk-style training signals a serious approach



Jake Paul’s rise from viral entertainer to headline boxer has never lacked spectacle, but his latest declaration has pushed the drama to a new level. As he prepares for what may be the most improbable matchup of his career, Paul insists he’s willing to give everything for a chance at a historic upset.The 28-year-old says his commitment is absolute, even if it means stepping into territory far more dangerous than anything he’s experienced in the ring so far.The fight, set for December 19 at the Kaseya Center in Miami and streamed live on Netflix, pairs Paul with Anthony Joshua, a former unified heavyweight champion. It’s a matchup that feels surreal on paper, yet both men are leaning into the moment. Paul is selling belief. Joshua is selling dominance. And the spectacle is drawing global attention.Jake Paul didn’t hold back at the opening press event, delivering one of the most intense statements of his career. Asked if he truly believed he could beat Anthony Joshua, Paul doubled down. “100% Self-belief is the most powerful thing in the world, and it's been there since my first fight,” he said.Then he went further, offering a line that stunned even longtime boxing observers: “I want him to cut me up, I want him to break my face, but guess what, he's gonna have to kill me to stop me, and I'm ready to die.Seriously, ready to die in the ring to win this fight.”Paul framed the matchup as a potential repeat of the Andy Ruiz shocker that handed Joshua his first loss. He even tossed his new diamond ammo chain into the mix as a wager. Joshua didn’t bite on the bet, but he didn’t shy from the tone Paul set. “If I'm being honest, I'ma break his face,” Joshua said. “I'ma break his body up, I'ma stomp all over him.”The bout comes after Paul canceled his planned fight against Gervonta Davis following allegations against the lightweight star.While Paul leans on bravado, Anthony Joshua is making quieter but meaningful adjustments behind the scenes. Instead of staying in London or working with longtime trainer Ben Davison, Joshua relocated to Spain to train under members of Oleksandr Usyk’s team. The change follows his knockout loss to Daniel Dubois last year and reflects a reset in his approach.“I won't be trained by Ben Davison,” Joshua confirmed. “I was invited to train with team Usyk. I've been in Spain, we've been doing some good training. He's one of the best in the world. It's been phenomenal man. It's been a great experience and it's very challenging.”Joshua, who hasn’t fought since September 2024, is expected to earn around $50 million for this bout. Despite the size of the paycheck, he insists his mentality hasn’t softened. “I'm going to break his face, I'm going to break his body up, I'm going to stomp all over him,” he said. “That's my mentality, that's a fighter's mentality. I know what's in my heart, what's in my mind. I'm here to compete.”The face-off has only extended the hype for the upcoming fight.Also Read: Saudi boxing chief makes tense Jake Paul statement moments after Anthony Joshua fight update",Anthony Joshua and Jake Paul face off in Miami on December 19.

Sacramento Kings veteran DeMar DeRozan opens up about team’s emotional struggles

Sacramento Kings veteran DeMar DeRozan didn't sugarcoat things after his team's recent embarrassing loss, straightforwardly stating that the squad's mentality is in a ""sh**ty place. "" The six-time All-Star's frank statements surfaced amid a challenging kickoff to the 2025-26 NBA season.The breaking point hit on Thursday, November 20, 2025, when the Kings faced a brutal 137-96 defeat against the Memphis Grizzlies in Sacramento. This marked their eighth straight loss, with three of those being by over 30 points, leaving them with a dismal 3-13 record to start the season. Even without some of their star players, the Grizzlies took control right from the start, jumping to a 15-point lead after the first quarter and stretching it to 37 by halftime. Memphis' bench came alive with significant contributions, while Sacramento's defense fell apart, giving up 42 assists and managing only 46.3 percent shooting from the field.After the game, DeRozan opened up in a chat with Sacramento Bee's Chris Biderman. When he was questioned about how the team was feeling, the 36-year-old guard was completely honest.""In a sh**ty place,"" DeRozan said to Biderman after the Grizzlies loss.He elaborated, telling Biderman, ""Don’t nobody want to lose the way we’ve been losing. I think it’s just everything right now for us is just sh**ty, honestly. Sometimes when you’re in the deep end, it’s hard to hear anything. You’re just trying to swim your way out, one way or another.""DeRozan's comments reflected the team's overall fatigue. The Kings have been losing by an average of 14.1 points each game during this rough patch, according to NBA.com advanced stats, transforming what was meant to be a dynamic offense into a chaotic situation. His reduced playing time—his lowest since coming to Sacramento—highlighted the night's hopelessness, as he sat on the bench while the gap widened beyond reach.The veteran was feeling frustrated, and it went beyond just the court. With all the trade rumors flying around him during the Kings' slump, DeRozan spoke directly to Biderman about his uncertain future: ""I’m pretty sure everything comes into question when you’re in the situation like we’re in now. That’s another thing that’s frustrating.That’s another thing. Only time will tell. We’ll see."" As he enters the last year of his three-year, $74 million contract, DeRozan has been connected to teams like the Warriors, but he’s still focused on turning the season around.Also Read: Giannis Antetokounmpo exits Milwaukee Bucks’ matchup with the Cleveland Cavaliers after intentional foul in second quarter","Sacramento Kings veteran DeMar DeRozan says team's mentality is in a ""sh**ty place"" Kings have lost eight straight games, with three of those by over 30 points.

Brandon Aiyuk contract payout and team frustration



The San Francisco 49ers are facing a difficult moment with wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk, and the tension inside the building now feels impossible to ignore. What started as a long recovery from a knee injury has grown into a deeper conflict that stretches far beyond the field. Reports indicate that frustration has been building for months, leaving the franchise unsure about whether the relationship with one of its most talented players can be repaired. The situation has shifted so rapidly that people around the league are questioning if Aiyuk has already played his final snap for San Francisco.The concerns began after Aiyuk landed on the physically unable to perform list in July while recovering from a torn ACL, MCL and meniscus. Kyle Shanahan believed in August that he could return by October, but the team has kept him on the list and has not brought him back. As the weeks passed, the issue became less about his health and more about his commitment. The Athletic reported that the 49ers grew upset with Aiyuk’s “lack of communication” after he reportedly missed meetings and other team duties. The publication also revealed that the franchise voided his guaranteed money for 2026, declaring that the absences counted as not fulfilling his contract.Brandon Aiyuk signed a four year, 120 million dollar extension in 2023 after a dramatic contract standoff. He later admitted that he made the process “a little bit more difficult than it needed to [be].” Now the 49ers are preparing for the financial fallout of cutting ties only fifteen months later. With guarantees voided, the team can recover his future 2026 payouts, which include a 24.935 million dollar option bonus, a 1.215 million dollar base salary, a 100,000 dollar workout bonus and roster bonuses worth 750,000 dollars per game, according to multiple reports. Aiyuk reportedly told the NFL Players Association that he does not plan to file a grievance, which suggests he expects a release at the end of the season.Before the injury, Aiyuk appeared in seven games in 2024 and posted 25 catches for 374 yards. His production stayed strong despite limited time. Yet insiders believe the relationship has reached its limit. As The Athletic reported, “It’s now likely that he (Aiyuk) has played his last game with the franchise.” The report added that attempts to salvage the situation are fading and that “multiple sources believe that a reconciliation is unlikely. ”General manager John Lynch recently said the team’s “intention is to get Brandon back.” But the reality is that both sides seem to be moving in different directions. After five seasons, Brandon Aiyuk’s time in San Francisco appears to be coming to an end.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes melts hearts with surprise gift for baby Golden and wife Brittany ahead of a must-win game against Colts","The San Francisco 49ers are facing a difficult moment with wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk.

Why Russell Wilson is the friend who wants all the tea



Ciara, Kelly Rowland & Lala Anthony: Red Flags, Signature Scents & Friendship | Level Up Radio

For Ciara and her circle of close friends, group chats are never dull, especially when Russell Wilson decides to show up in the middle of the discussion. The Giants quarterback often finds himself at the center of their conversations, not because he tries to lead them, but because he cannot resist joining in. On the latest episode of Apple Music’s Level Up Radio, Ciara sat with Kelly Rowland and La La Anthony and the trio let listeners in on what really happens behind the scenes. Their stories painted a lively picture of Wilson, who often slips into the chat with genuine curiosity and a sense of humor that keeps everyone entertained.The women shared lighthearted moments that revealed the quarterback’s playful and thoughtful side. Even as Wilson works through a difficult stretch in his NFL journey, it is clear that his role within Ciara’s trusted circle is as strong as ever. Their conversations showed how he blends fun with honest advice, something all three women value.Kelly Rowland set the tone by declaring, “Russ is nosy,” a comment that caused the group to burst into laughter. La La Anthony quickly backed her up, adding, “He’s all in my business.” According to them, Wilson will not hesitate to jump into a discussion with a direct question that catches everyone off guard. Rowland joked, “He will come in the middle of the conversation and [Ciara] is like, ‘Russ Russ Russ,’ and he just outright asks.Even with all the teasing, their remarks came from a place of affection. Anthony said she values Wilson’s honesty, especially when she needs guidance. “I love his input because sometimes you do need the male perspective. And he’s another one, he will check me,” she said. “He’ll be like, ‘Sis, this is what you’re doing wrong.’”Ciara agreed and explained how the dynamic works for all of them. “We always hold the girls down… Y’all have your own thing with Russ, so my point is if there is something that is love-related, not deep, I’ll be like, ‘Baby, we gotta check on our friends,’” she said. Anthony added that Ciara creates the space for boundaries, saying, “For me, you give me the space to share with him whatever I choose or whatever I don’t choose to share with him. ”Their bond continues even while Wilson navigates the ups and downs of his 14th NFL season. After being benched earlier this year, he remained committed to the team, saying, “I’m not done.

The affection Jahmyr Gibbs shows for Nicole Anderson mirrors the devotion Myles Garrett has for Chloe Kim



More coverage on Jahmyr Gibbs and Myles Garrett:

Picture this: Myles Garrett, the Cleveland Browns’ top-earning defensive end, making a grand entrance for Olympic Gold Medalist Chloe Kim at the 2025 Crunchyroll Anime Awards in Tokyo. Fast forward a few months, and the tables turn as the superstar snowboarder surprises Garrett at his practice, just days after his headline-grabbing 100 mph speeding incident. Their magnetic connection is mirrored in the romance between Jahmyr Gibbs and his girlfriend, Nicole Anderson, who brings together Korean and Swedish heritage.The Myles-Chloe chemistry is undeniable, especially when Garrett gazes at Kim with unwavering focus during a Tokuriki Channel interview, and the second-generation Korean-American returns the favor on their first red carpet walk, unable to take her eyes off him. This kind of love finds its echo in Detroit Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs and fashion model Nicole Anderson. When Anderson recently posted six stunning close-ups on Instagram , Gibbs couldn’t help but comment, “Lil fine shi,” a lighthearted acknowledgement of her attractiveness. Even Christen Harper Goff, wife of quarterback Jared Goff, chimed in with an enthusiastic, “Obsessed.”This is hardly the first time the two-time Pro Bowler has showered his affection in the comments. When Anderson posted a photo modeling beside a snowmobile, Gibbs chimed in with, “Fine shi.” For their Halloween transformation into Neytiri and Jake Sully from the AVATAR movie, he enthusiastically commented, “U fly now… with me!” In October, Anderson embraced her NFL WAG status by cheering Gibbs on at his game, captioning her post, “Bring your gf to work day!” Gibbs responded with a proud, “HERRR.”Another post showed Anderson in cowboy attire at a stable, with a horse resting its face on her neck. Gibbs, ever the doting boyfriend, joked, “Me and that horse gonna have a chat.”On the other hand, Garrett has also left his footprints on Kim’s Instagram posts. In September, Kim shared workout snapshots in sleek yoga attire, a black sports bra with a racerback design and double shoulder straps and solid black, tight-fitting, high-waisted leggings, ending with a quote about loving her body (My body allows me to do what I love, and I love her for that). Myles’ response? “Put some clothes on.” In a recent snowboarding post, Kim’s masked face added mystery with the caption, “spooky. ?” Garrett couldn’t resist, calling it, “Goofy.?” Myles Garrett and Chloe Kim’s love story began in May 2025, while Jahmyr Gibbs and Nicole Anderson have been a lovey-dovey pair since May 2023. Though their love is two years wiser, both couples radiate a youthful spark.","Myles Garrett and Chloe Kim's love story began in May 2025.

A look at Julie and Zach Ertz’s earnings and longtime contributions

Inside the financial growth and future plans of the power couple

Zach Ertz and Julie Ertz are one of America’s most accomplished sports couples. They are each building remarkable careers in football independently. One of them is in the NFL, and the other is in women’s soccer. By 2025, their combined net worth reflects not only years of top-notch athletic performance but also smart financial planning. Their endorsements and long-term investments are quite praiseworthy. Together, they have created a strong financial foundation that continues to grow.Julie Ertz is a two-time World Cup champion and one of the most respected players in U.S. women’s soccer. She earned millions throughout her professional career. According to sources, Julie’s reported salary stands at roughly $2.8 million per year. This is nothing but a reflection of her on-field earnings, sponsorship deals, and various off-field income sources. Earlier reports from some of the sources estimated her annual breakdown as $700,000 from on-field activities and $1.3 million from endorsements.Julie’s club career included significant time with the Chicago Red Stars before joining Angel City FC in 2023.Her 123 appearances for the U.S. Women’s National Team, World Cup victories, and Olympic performances have all contributed to her financial success. Even after announcing her retirement from international soccer in 2023, Julie remains active in philanthropic work, brand partnerships, and sports-related initiatives, ventures that continue to add to her earnings.Zach later continued his career with the Arizona Cardinals and Baltimore Ravens, earning additional salary, incentives, and signing bonuses that contributed significantly to his net worth. Beyond the field, he has invested in training centers, real estate, and charitable initiatives, particularly through the Ertz Family Foundation, which he and Julie run together.By 2025, estimates place the couple’s combined net worth at well over $30 million, though exact figures vary depending on endorsements, business investments, and career transitions. Their wealth is diversified across athlete income, brand partnerships, real estate, and charitable ventures they’ve nurtured throughout their careers.One notable aspect of their financial strategy is the balance between steady income and purpose-driven investment. Their foundation supports youth sports, education, and community development, showing that their financial success is closely tied to giving back.As of 2025, both Zach and Julie are transitioning into new chapters, Julie into retirement and media opportunities, and Zach into the later stages of his NFL career while exploring post-football ventures.

WTC Final: Steve Smith on future, facing South Africa and revised format

Poll Who do you think won the battle of words between Monty Panesar and Steve Smith? Monty Panesar Steve Smith It's a tie

The first Test of the Ashes has begun with an unexpected off-field storm, as former England spinner Monty Panesar unleashed a blistering response to Australia's stand-in captain Steve Smith , escalating what has become the most unlikely feud of the series. Smith had earlier mocked Panesar's infamous Celebrity Mastermind appearance while reacting to the former cricketer's advice that England should needle the Australian skipper by resurrecting memories of the 2018 Sandpaper Gate scandal. The Australian star told reporters to “do yourself a favour” and watch Panesar's quiz-show errors — including mixing up Athens' location and calling America a city — calling it “pretty comical”.But Panesar struck back with ferocity in a Telegraph column, claiming he had “won the battle” and branding Smith's press-conference comments as proof of “mental vulnerability” ahead of a blockbuster series opener.“To think that he wanted to talk about me before one of the biggest days of his career… is flattering and nothing short of hilarious,” Panesar wrote. “I cannot believe he has dug out the old YouTube clip of my shocker and memorised it word by word.”Panesar conceded his Mastermind performance was “terrible” and “a shocker”, but insisted it was still preferable to Smith's own missteps. “We've both made mistakes, but at least mine was on a celebrity quiz show.His was on a cricket field, and we both have to live by them. It seems right now only one of us can.”The former spinner went further, saying if he ever confronted Smith, he would question whether the 36-year-old could “look himself in the mirror yet” after Cape Town 2018. “I would ask Steve whether he can actually admit he was part of Sandpapergate — the worst example of Australian cheating in history.”Panesar suggested Smith's reaction proved England had already succeeded in getting inside his head. “I am delighted to have got so far inside his mind… imagine how much damage Ben Stokes and his side are going to be able to do once play starts in Perth?”He even offered sledging scripts for England players: “If I was Jofra Archer, I'd be telling him ‘I'm swinging the ball even without sandpaper'; if I was Joe Root: ‘Fine or coarse paper, mate? Tell us the tricks of your trade.'”With both sides gearing up for the brutal on-field contest, the Panesar–Smith saga has added an unexpected psychological subplot to an already high-voltage Ashes opener.",Former England spinner Monty Panesar hits back at Steve Smith.

India batting coach Sitanshu Kotak shares key update on Shubman Gill's fitness ahead of second Test in Guwahati

NEW DELHI: India Test captain Shubman Gill has been released from the squad ahead of the Guwahati Test and has already left for Mumbai on Friday. The youngster travelled with the side on November 19 but didn't turn up for training on November 20. It is learnt that he will be resting in Mumbai for the next two-three days before seeking specialist opinion from Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala. As of now, there is no trip planned to the BCCI Centre of Excellence (CoE) and more clarity is expected in the coming days.In Gill's absence, Pant will lead the side in the crucial second Test vs South Africa starting November 22. The team management will have to take some tough Playing XI calls and as TimesofIndia.com had reported, Sai Sudharsan and Nitish Kumar Reddy are frontrunners to be picked with Axar Patel likely to return on the bench. In the training session on eve of the match, only KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sudharsan turned up as the rest took it easy.India lost the first Test at the Eden Gardens inside three days and a lot of focus has been on the playing surface since then. While Eden wasn't the ideal surface, Guwahati is expected to roll out a red soil pitch which will offer both turn and bounce. It may not be as unplayable as Eden but will keep the spinners in play.India batting coach Sitanshu Kotak spoke at length about the pitch for the opening Test and felt it wasn't something they expected.""See, in the last match wicket, Gautam said that he took all the blame on himself. He said that he took the blame because he felt that he should not put the blame on the curators,"" Kotak said. ""Now, what happened in the last match, after a day, it felt like it was crumbling. There was a little bit of soil [that came up after the ball pitched]. All of you can see that. That was not expected. Even if the spin was expected, it was after 3 days or on the third day in the evening. Sometimes, the weather, sometimes, even the curators did not want it. I am telling you the truth. No one wanted it to be like this.""",India Test captain Shubman Gill has been released from the squad ahead of the Guwahati Test.

NEW DELHI: Sarfaraz Khan ’s continued absence from the Indian Test team has led to questions from several former players.

His highest score in Tests is 150.""I think there is a clarity issue in the case of Sarfaraz. I think it is a case of perception and understanding. I am trying to think—they might have a perception that he may not do as well in swinging conditions or play fast bowling well. Maybe he is not our guy in SENA countries. So he did not get the chance. But even to make that perception, I have to allow him to fail. He is not even being allowed to fail. And now there is no place in the team as well,"" Chopra said on Shubhankar Mishra's YouTube channel.Chopra added, ""I think Sarfaraz should play, or else it would be unfair.""Sarfaraz has also has had a difficult Ranji Trophy season so far, scoring 178 runs in five matches with one fifty.The right-hander batter’s returns are indeed low for the lofty standards he has set in the Ranji Trophy in the seasons preceding his India Test call-up.

Poll What do you think about Usman Khawaja being barred from starting the innings? Poor decision by the management Necessary for player safety Indifferent, it happens in cricket

Australia’s opening day of the Ashes took an unexpected turn when Usman Khawaja was barred from starting the innings.The opener, who had spent an extended period off the ground with stiffness, did not meet the minimum on-field requirement to bat.Stand-in captain Steve Smith tried to bring him back shortly before England’s innings ended, but the collapse came too quickly for the 38-year-old to regain eligibility.That forced a reshuffle, with Marnus Labuschagne walking out alongside debutant Jake Weatherald.Former Australia allrounder Tom Moody criticised the confusion on Fox Cricket, calling it “poor management… Beyond a joke… like Starc led the attack, we needed Uzzie [Khawaja] to lead the batting.”Weatherald’s debut lasted only two balls, trapped lbw by Jofra Archer after a review, leaving Smith to take strike much earlier than planned. Khawaja, still unable to bat because the dismissal came too soon after his return to the field, remained in the dressing room as Australia attempted to settle after the disruption.He finally came on after the wicket of Marnus Labuschagne in the 15th over, but only managed 2 runs and lasted just an over.The day had already swung violently before the batting order drama.Mitchell Starc demolished England with a fiery 7/58, ripping through the top order inside the first hour and returning after lunch to break the middle order.Only Harry Brook (52) and Ollie Pope (46) offered resistance as England were dismissed for 172, with debutant Brendan Doggett supporting Starc with 2/27.Australia’s reply was equally turbulent. England’s quicks hit back hard, led by captain Ben Stokes, who produced a six-over burst returning 5/23. Archer and Brydon Carse added two wickets each as Australia slid to 123/9 by stumps, still trailing by 49.Smith and Labuschagne held through the early storm, but England maintained pressure throughout the evening session.With the match finely balanced, both sides head into day two with the contest wide open.","Usman Khawaja did not meet the minimum on-field requirement to bat.

Why coach Gautam Gambhir can't continue with his IPL ways in Test cricket

India’s evolving approach to their batting order has once again raised eyebrows, with head coach Gautam Gambhir and the team management making another unexpected shuffle during the first Test against South Africa at Eden Gardens. In a move that surprised many, India fielded four frontline spinners and sent Washington Sundar in at number 3, a slot previously occupied by Sai Sudharsan in the West Indies series earlier this year. Before that, both Sudharsan and Karun Nair had been used at the same position during the tour of England.Former India batter Aakash Chopra voiced his concerns over the continuous reshuffling and questioned whether the team was lacking clarity in its long-term plans.“Washington Sundar has presented himself as a phenomenal option who can bat at the top of the order, and of course is a more than handy bowler. The bigger question that Gautam and the team management need to answer is are we going to keep changing goalposts after every series?” Chopra said during a JioStar media day interaction.Sudharsan, who made scores of 7, 87 and 39 against the West Indies, found himself out of the XI for the opening Test against South Africa. Sundar replaced him at number 3 and made 29 and 31 in the match.“You’re well within your rights to go with Washington, but if Washi is your long term choice, then were we just wasting time with Sai Sudharsan or even Karun Nair to bat at 3?” Chopra asked.He stressed that India’s top order must prioritise pure batting attributes above all else.“You would first want to prioritise the batting capabilities, not only the skill but also the temperament and the patience and the ability to bat time. That is why you look for the purest specialists who have only one job to do. Your top 4 or 5 are there just to bat and nothing else.”Chopra added that if Sundar is indeed being groomed primarily as a batter, the last several months of experimentation may have served little purpose.“If you choose Washington Sundar as a batter, fair enough, but it just feels like the last six or seven months were futile and you didn't really gain anything from it,” he said.He also questioned the messaging to Sudharsan, who performed reasonably well but still lost his place.“What message do you give to Sai Sudharsan that we gave you a chance, you scored the runs, but we had a change of heart. Transition gives you the chance to experiment, but what makes it easier is clarity and consistency,” Chopra concluded.",India's evolving approach to their batting order has once again raised eyebrows.

Why is the series called The Ashes?



What is inside the urn?



NEW DELHI: England and Australia are facing off in the opening Test of the 2025-26 Ashes series at the Optus Stadium in Perth, renewing one of cricket’s most iconic rivalries. The contest derives its famous name from a mock obituary printed in 1882 after Australia claimed their first Test win on English soil.For both nations, the Ashes series carries immense prestige, often regarded as being on par with the honour of winning a World Cup. Its name has a unique and storied origin rooted in cricket history.The term originated on August 29, 1882, when English journalist Reginald Shirley Brooks published a tongue-in-cheek obituary in the Sporting Times following England’s defeat at The Oval.""English cricket was dead and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia,"" Brooks wrote in the Sporting Times.England captain Ivo Bligh vowed to reclaim those “ashes” during the team’s upcoming tour of Australia later that year. England went on to win the series 2-1.After that triumph, a small urn was presented to Bligh’s team, giving rise to the tradition of calling every future Test series between England and Australia “The Ashes.”What the urn actually contains has long been debated. Some believe it holds the ashes of a bail from the third match of the 1882 series, while others speculate it might contain remnants of a burnt ball cover or stump.In 1998, Bligh’s daughter-in-law offered another theory, claiming the urn held the ashes of her mother-in-law’s burnt veil.The original urn was handed over to the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord’s after Bligh’s death in 1927, and since then, teams have competed for a replica of the treasured artifact.Today, the England–Australia rivalry remains one of cricket’s most iconic and fiercely contested battles, with both sides determined to claim the coveted urn.","England and Australia face off in the opening Test of the 2025-26 Ashes series at the Optus Stadium in Perth.

One Dead, Thousands Evacuated as Cyclone Montha Tears Through Andhra and Odisha

VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh is bracing up for another cyclone as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast formation of a low-pressure area over southeast Bay of Bengal on November 22 (Saturday). The weather system is expected to move west-northwestwards and intensify into a depression over central parts of south Bay of Bengal around Nov 24.The weather experts anticipate that the system may further strengthen into a cyclonic storm over the southwest Bay of Bengal, potentially setting the state for another wet spell over coastal Andhra Pradesh (CAP) as well as Rayalaseema from Nov 26 to 29.If the low-pressure-area intensified into a cyclone, the season’s second cyclone storm would move closer to the Andhra Pradesh coast. It may be recalled that severe cyclonic storm Montha on October 28 and 29 this year left a trail of destruction in parts of Andhra Pradesh, leaving two persons dead and inundating agricultural crops over 80,000 hectares, damaging roads and culverts. The severe cyclonic storm crossed the Andhra Pradesh and Yanam coasts close to Narsapuram in Andhra Pradesh on Oct 29.Ahead of the system’s intensification, the weathermen have advised the farmers to complete harvest works as the farmers have suffered losses in the recent October rains.Meanwhile, cold weather conditions continue to grip the tribal pockets in the Alluri Sitharama Raju (ASR) district, where residents are shivering under plummeting temperatures. On Thursday (Nov 20), Chintapalle recorded a minimum temperature of 9.5°C — the second lowest of the season so far. It may be recalled that Chintapalle recorded 6.8°C on Wednesday (Nov 19).","The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast formation of a low-pressure area over southeast Bay of Bengal on November 22 (Saturday) The weather system is expected to move west-northwestwards and intensify into a depression over central parts of south Bay of Bay around Nov 24.

Patrick Beverley’s abuse allegation puts his Barstool career in danger

The former Los Angeles Clippers player, Patrick Beverley, is all over the internet due to his felony charges against his sister. According to TMZ Sports, Beverly allegedly punched and choked his sister, Mya Beverley, after he found her with an 18-year-old man late at night. The situation worsened after he abused her and grabbed her by the neck. However, an American businessman, Dave Portnoy, hinted that he might cut Beverley out of Barstool Sports only if the allegations were proven to be true.Patrick Beverley has a podcast with the company, “Hooping’ N Hollerin”. But the real question is: How far is he going to be a part of the company, and what happens if he gets kicked out of it? Well, according to his sister, Mya, Patrick Beverley committed a felony, and he was arrested and booked for felony charges.According to the reports published by TMZ Sports, Beverley is now under arrest. Dave Portnoy said, “We'll let the facts play out”. “Certainly, with what is hanging there, we can't have him be part of what we're doing right now, and we got to see how it settles, but this is horrible. If there's any truth to it, he won't be back at Barstool”, Portnoy added further.Based on what Portnoy has heard, he confirmed that there is absolutely no reason why they should take a rash decision about Beverley’s career.But, from what they saw in the documents, things are going to get ugly and intense, in short, “brutal”. Portnoy also confirmed that he and Beverley spoke on the phone after the story was brought to the surface by his 15-year-old sister.His sister said, “Beverley grabbed her by the neck and with both hands, and picked her up off the ground, by having her feet come up from the floor”. He even pushed her body against the wall of an open room in their house. Moreover, Beverley gave her a death threat, saying he would be the family relative to kill her.Patrick Beverley has a court hearing next month. While his lawyers and legal team have denied the allegations, saying that those were incorrect, one of them said that he would be cleared of all the felony charges in the near future.Also read: Patrick Beverley’s attorney issues statement after accused’s sister drafts affidavit against former NBA player","Former LA Clippers player, Patrick Beverley, has been charged with felony assault.

NEW DELHI: India’s streak of unfavorable tosses continued as newly appointed Test captain Rishabh Pant lost the toss to South Africa’s Temba Bavuma at Guwahati’s Barsapara Stadium on Saturday, during the city's inaugural Test. South Africa opted to bat first on the red-soil pitch, expected to favor batters early before assisting spinners.Pant made history as India’s 38th Test captain and the first wicketkeeper-batter to lead the team since MS Dhoni.India have now lost eight of their last nine tosses, highlighting their recent misfortune with the coin flip.Shubman Gill, sidelined with a neck injury, had lost all five tosses during India’s series in England earlier this year.

In Kolkata last week, he lost another crucial toss, and India failed to chase 124 on a tricky pitch with uneven bounce.""We feel the wicket is good for batting.

Surgeon named Jeffrey Epstein is mistakenly dragged into Epstein files scandal by Congresswoman; here's what he said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/surgeon-named-jeffrey-epstein-is-mistakenly-dragged-into-epstein-files-scandal-by-congresswoman-heres-what-he-said/articleshow/125492548.cms,"



A neurosurgeon who happens to share a name with one of the world’s most notorious criminals has fired back after being dragged into a political row by mistake.Dr Jeffrey Epstein, a respected Long Island doctor, was publicly implicated by Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett to be the late sex trafficker and pedophile during a speech. This made the medical expert angry for and he crafted a plan for revenge.Crockett told Congress this week she was “gonna expose it all” after spotting donations from “somebody named Jeffrey Epstein” to former New York congressman Lee Zeldin. She suggested the contributions came from Epstein, even though the donations were made in 2020, long after the convicted offender died in jail in 2019.According to FEC records, Dr Jeffrey Epstein — the neurosurgeon, not the disgraced financier — donated $1,000 to Lee Zeldin in April and August 2020. When Democrats questioned Zeldin about why “Jeffrey Epstein” appeared in his filings, he responded: “Yes, Crockett, a physician named Dr. Jeffrey Epstein (who is a totally different person than the other Jeffrey Epstein) donated to a prior campaign of mine,” Zeldin wrote.Speaking to The New York Post, the real Dr Epstein said he had never faced such an accusation until Crockett’s comments. “Until she said something, it was never an issue,” he said.While people sometimes react to his name because of the deeds of the infamous criminal Epstein, he added that he normally plays it down. “I say my name and sometimes people will give me a look, or whatever. I always look at them and say, ‘I don’t understand,’ and I make it like I’m dumb. ”The doctor joked about the perfect payback. “I think that I should contribute money to Jasmine Crockett and then let everybody know that she also took money from Jeffrey Epstein,” he said.He insisted he is unfazed by the bad title attached to his name. “Listen, that’s my name,” he said. “If my name was Jeffrey Dahmer when that whole thing came out, do you think that would be a problem? Listen, anytime a doppelganger is tied to a less-than-desirable, it’s never a good situation. But it doesn’t matter to me. I could[n’t] care less.”","Dr Jeffrey Epstein, a respected Long Island doctor, was publicly implicated by Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett to be the late sex trafficker and pedophile during a speech.

"Railin’ Nalin: Nikki Haley’ son, Punjab da grand-puttar, goes anti-immigrant",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/railin-nalin-nikki-haley-son-punjab-da-grand-puttar-goes-anti-immigrant/articleshow/125490616.cms,"file photo

The TOI correspondent from Washington





: In the swirling vortex of post-2024 American politics, where Donald Trump's second term has amplified the ""America First"" chorus, a surprisingly new contrarian voice has emerged from an unlikely “desi” family.Nalin Haley, the 24-year-old son of former U.N. Ambassador and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley , is rapidly ascending Republican ranks as a populist provocateur. His hardline stances on immigration—calling for an end to H-1B visas, limits on foreign students, and bans on naturalized citizens holding office (which would disqualify his grandfather) — have ignited a fierce debate whether he is a nepotistic outlier whose views betray his immigrant roots or if he embodies the raw frustrations of Gen-Z conservatives, many, like him, of immigrant origin.Born five days before 9/11 in South Carolina to Nikki (née Nimrata Randhawa) and Michael Haley, Nalin grew up in the shadow of his mother's meteoric rise in the GOP. His Sikh grandfather, Ajit Singh Randhawa, immigrated from Ludhiana in 1969, an agriculture scientist building an academic career at Voorhees College amid the era's anti-immigrant undercurrents. While Nikki Haley embraced Christianity in 1996 after her marriage even as she continued to practise the Sikh faith, her father remained a turbaned, practising Sikh till his death in 2024; Nalin was baptized in the Methodist church at his birth before converting to Catholicism during college.Two recent interviews in which Nalin has expressed unapologetically restrictionist views on immigration mark a stark political divergence from his mother, a polished internationalist who has long championed merit-based legal immigration as ""central to the American story,"" defending H-1B visas for skilled workers and rejecting blanket restrictions. But Nalin has not only called for ending the H-1B program and capping foreign students in universities—""some of them are spies for foreign governments,"" he also wants to stop legal immigration.In an interview with Tucker Carlson, he insisted ""naturalized citizens should not be able to hold public office"" because ""growing up here is a big part of understanding the country."" While railing against H1B visa, he wheeled out the familiar trope of foreign workers ""taking jobs that Americans can do"" amid AI disruptions and a ""fragile economy,"" citing his own friends -- ""All graduated, great degrees from great schools. .. not one of them has a job.""Nikki Haley has remained publicly silent on her son's insurgency, immigration defenders are horrified by his purported “betrayal.” British-Indian American journalist Mehdi Hasan, whose forbears hail from Hyderabad, and whom Nalin called for denaturalizing and deporting, calls his rhetoric ""hypocritical"" and xenophobic,” pointing out that his own Sikh grandfather faced anti-immigrant sentiments. Other critics also warn that his rhetoric endangers foreign-born naturalized lawmakers (19 in the current congress , including Pramila Jayapal and Raja Krishnamoorthi) and such views will eventually come back to bite immigrant legatees, particularly if they are not white.Nalin is unapologetic, arguing that the future of American Gen Z, even those of immigrant origin, lies in being nationalists and ignoring youth anger over ""wanting a job, affordable housing, and safe streets"" risks radicalization.Supporters hail him as a ""polished"" successor to firebrands like Charlie Kirk or even Nick Fuentes, but with broader appeal: Articulate, faith-infused, and focused on economic nationalism rather than fringe extremism. Some see him as a wingman for vice-president JD Vance, whom he has praised, amid talk of a possible run for Congress.","Nalin Haley, the 24-year-old son of former U.N.
