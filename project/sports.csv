NEW DELHI: New Zealand 's hopes of advancing to the Super Eight stage in the ongoing T20 World Cup were in jeopardy after a 13-run defeat against the West Indies in Trinidad on Thursday. The co-hosts, who have now won their first three matches, became the fourth team to qualify for the next round.The other three teams already qualified for the Super Eights are - India, Australia and South Africa.Batting first, the West Indies found themselves in a precarious position at 30 for five in the seventh over. However, Sherfane Rutherford 's scintillating unbeaten 68 off just 39 deliveries, which included two fours and six sixes, propelled the home side to a respectable total of 149 for nine.In response, the Black Caps, who were thrashed by Afghanistan in their opening match, struggled to gain any momentum in their chase. The Kiwis were restricted to 136 for nine, with only Glenn Phillips (40 off 33 balls) posing any significant threat to the West Indies' bowling attack.The West Indies' bowlers were instrumental in securing the victory, with pacer Alzarri Joseph claiming four wickets for 19 runs, while spinnersGudakesh Motie and Akeal Hosein picked up three and one wickets, respectively.Despite Mitchell Santner's late heroics, smashing three sixes off Romario Shepherd in the final over, the match was effectively over as a contest when Phillips fell to Joseph in the 18th over.The defeat leaves New Zealand's fate hanging by a thread, with their elimination from the tournament confirmed if Afghanistan defeat Papua New Guinea on Friday. The West Indies, on the other hand, have clinched their place in the Super Eight phase with one group match still to come against Afghanistan on Monday in St Lucia.",West Indies beat New Zealand by 13 runs in T20 World Cup match. Co-hosts become fourth team to qualify for the next round. New Zealand's fate hangs in the balance after defeat.

NEW DELHI: India's batting stars aim to overcome a tricky Nassau County pitch against an impressive but inexperienced USA in their T20 World Cup group match. India needs one more win to secure a Super Eight berth.Despite the pitch's two-paced nature, a high-risk approach could pay off better than against Pakistan. Indian Americans like Saurabh Netravalkar and Harmeet Singh will face their birth country, eager to bridge the gap with their diverse team.Also see: T20 WORLD CUP 2024 Schedule USA’s recent win over Pakistan could inspire a standout performance.Facing India's top players like Rohit Sharma , Virat Kohli , and Jasprit Bumrah offers the USA valuable experience.India's last match in this venue might see them opt to bat first, with Bumrah, Siraj, and Jadeja posing a tough challenge for USA's batsmen. Emotional subplots include Netravalkar bowling to former teammate Suryakumar Yadav, and USA spinners Harmeet and Kenjige attempting to contain Rishabh Pant.India has never faced the USA in a T20 International, making their upcoming clash in the T20 World Cup a historic encounter. This match not only marks the first time these two teams will compete in this format, but it also highlights the growing global reach of cricket For India, a cricketing powerhouse, playing against a burgeoning cricket nation like the USA provides an opportunity to showcase their dominance and experience. Meanwhile, for the USA, this match offers a chance to test their skills against one of the world's best teams, potentially drawing more attention to the sport in America and inspiring future generations of cricketers.The Nassau County International Cricket Stadium boasts a bowling-friendly pitch that presents significant challenges for batters, often leading to low-scoring matches. The pitch offers substantial assistance to pace bowlers, making it difficult for batters to score runs freely. Consequently, teams may find it advantageous to chase targets at this ground due to the batting difficulties.Nassau County International Cricket Stadium has hosted seven T20 matches, with teams winning three times while batting first and four times while chasing. The average first innings score is 107, and the average second innings score is 105, indicating that the pitch provides a balanced contest between bat and ball.The highest total recorded at this venue is 137/7 by Canada against Ireland, demonstrating the challenges batters face in posting high scores. Conversely, Sri Lanka hold the record for the lowest total, being bowled out for 77 in 19.1 overs against South Africa, underscoring the pitch's difficulty for batting.Chasing teams have had notable success at this stadium, with Pakistan achieving the highest successful chase of 107/3 in 17.3 overs against Canada. On the defensive side, South Africa hold the record for the lowest total successfully defended, restricting Bangladesh to 113/6 in their 20 overs.1) Given the low average scores and the difficulty batters face in posting high totals at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, prioritize selecting strong bowlers for your fantasy team. Focus on picking pace bowlers, as they are likely to exploit the pitch conditions effectively, similar to how South Africa restricted Sri Lanka to 77 runs and defended a modest total of 113 against Bangladesh.2) Since teams have won more frequently while chasing (four out of seven matches), consider including reliable middle-order batsmen who can stabilize and anchor the innings during a chase. Players who are adept at handling pressure and have a proven track record in run chases, like Pakistan's successful pursuit of 107 against Canada, would be valuable additions to your fantasy lineup.Hardik Pandya will be a crucial player for India, bringing his all-round capabilities to the fore in the match against the USA. Known for his explosive batting, Pandya can provide the much-needed impetus during the middle and death overs. Additionally, his ability to bowl crucial overs, especially in high-pressure situations, makes him an invaluable asset. His experience and versatility are likely to play a significant role in navigating the tricky Nassau County pitch.Jasprit Bumrah's ability as one of the world’s premier fast bowlers will be pivotal for India against the USA. His mastery in delivering yorkers and slower balls with precision, particularly on a pitch that aids seamers, could stifle the opposition's batting lineup. Bumrah’s knack for taking early wickets and his effectiveness at the death make him a formidable opponent, likely to challenge the USA batsmen throughout the innings.Saurabh Netravalkar, a former India U-19 player, now spearheading the USA bowling attack, will be a key player to watch. His familiarity with Indian players and experience in various conditions could provide an edge. Netravalkar’s left-arm seam bowling, combined with his ability to swing the ball, will be crucial in exploiting any weaknesses in the Indian batting lineup.Rohit Sharma (c), Hardik Pandya, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant, Sanju Samson, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd.

NEW DELHI: Veteran all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan returned to form with an impressive half-century and leg-spinner Rishad Hossain delivered crucial strikes as Bangladesh moved closer to the Super 8s, securing a 25-run victory over the Netherlands in the T20 World Cup in Kingstown on Thursday.Chasing a target of 160, the Netherlands were stopped at 134 for eight at the picturesque Arnos Vale Ground, hosting its first international match in 10 years.The Bangladesh win also led to the elimination of Sri Lanka from the tournament.Shakib made a strong comeback with a 46-ball 64, helping Bangladesh post a competitive total of 159 for five after being asked to bat.Alongside Shakib, Tanzid Hasan contributed 35 off 26 balls and Mahmudullah added 25 off 21 balls.In their chase, the Dutch lost two early wickets with just 32 runs on the board as the powerplay was about to conclude.Vikramjit Singh looked dangerous, scoring 26 off 16 balls with three sixes but Mahmudullah managed to have him stumped, leaving the Netherlands at 69 for three at the halfway mark.Sybrand Engelbrecht (33 off 22 balls) and skipper Scott Edwards (25 off 23) formed a significant partnership, adding 42 runs for the fourth wicket before Rishad Hossain's two-wicket burst turned the match decisively in Bangladesh's favor.Mustafizur Rahman, bowling brilliantly from the other end, removed Edwards, and Rishad followed up by dismissing Logan van Beek for cheap, putting Bangladesh firmly in control.Facing a daunting target of 86 off 60 balls, the Netherlands tried to keep the contest alive but collapsed, losing four wickets as Taskin Ahmed (2/30), Rishad (3/33), and Mustafizur Rahman (1/12) performed exceptionally well.Earlier, with two left-handers opening the innings for Bangladesh, Netherlands captain Scott Edwards handed the new ball to off-spinner Aryan Dutt in the second over. The strategic move paid off instantly as Dutt claimed the big wicket of Bangladesh skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto (1).Shanto’s dismissal was largely due to poor shot selection as he attempted an unnecessary reverse sweep, resulting in a catch at the first slip.Dutt struck again at the beginning of the fourth over, thanks to a stunning catch in the deep by Sybrand Engelbrecht. Litton Das’s sweep towards square-leg was brilliantly intercepted by Engelbrecht, who covered significant ground to secure a diving catch.Das' shot was deemed unnecessary, especially after Tanzid Hasan had just picked up two boundaries and a six in the previous over. Tanzid had showcased his aggression by dancing down the pitch and lofting a maximum over the covers.Dutt, being the only change in the Dutch lineup for this crucial Group D match, justified his selection with excellent figures of 2 for 17. Paul van Meekeren also impressed with the ball, taking 2 for 15.Bangladesh accelerated with a productive 18-run fourth over bowled by Vivian Kingma.Shakib, struggling for form before this game, found his rhythm and smashed four boundaries in the sixth over, which yielded 19 runs, taking Bangladesh to 54 for two by the end of the powerplay.In an attempt to keep the momentum, Tanzid Hasan tried to hit van Meekeren against the wind but ended up holing out to Bas de Leede in the outfield.Bangladesh's two most experienced players, Mahmudullah and Shakib, then added 41 runs for the fourth wicket, stabilizing the innings.However, as the innings approached its final phase, Mahmudullah, having hit two sixes and two fours, was caught near the ropes by Engelbrecht, struggling against the strong wind.Engelbrecht’s second solid catch highlighted the fielding efforts that kept the Dutch in contention for large parts of the game.Despite the Dutch bowlers applying pressure, Bangladesh's middle order, spearheaded by Shakib’s assuring knock, managed to build a competitive total that proved too challenging for the Netherlands to chase down.This performance by Bangladesh not only strengthened their chances of advancing in the tournament but also showcased a balanced team effort with both bat and ball.",Bangladesh beat the Netherlands by 25 runs in T20 World Cup Group D match. Shakib Al Hasan scored an impressive half-century for Bangladesh. Sri Lanka were eliminated from the tournament after losing to Bangladesh. The Netherlands were bowled out for 134 chasing a target of 160.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110977339,imgsize-94020,width-400,resizemode-4/110977339.jpg"

Living the Indian and American Dream



A New Migrant Song

Cricket in USA



techie got the USA off to a dream start. He added the cherry on the cake by also dismissing his former Mumbai senior and current India captain Rohit Sharma.These lines from The New Colossus, the 1883 poem by Emma Lazarus, are etched in bronze on the Statue of Liberty’s pedestal and stand as a promise of the American Dream at the heart of the message for any immigrant coming to the US.One of those stories that took a roundabout route involved Santiago Munez, the fictional protagonist of Goal: The Dream Begins (2005), an illegal immigrant from Los Angeles who travels to the Premier League and becomes a big-time ball player with Newcastle United. The tale of an illegal American immigrant from Los Angeles crossing the oceans to become a big-game ball player was a little different from the one promised by the words etched on the Statue of Liberty, but 19 years later, Saurabh Netravalkar, not an illegal immigrant per se, seems to be living the same dream but with whipped cream on top.Netravalkar is living both the American dream (becoming a professionally successful migrant in the Shining City on the Top of the Hill) and the Indian dream (beating Pakistan in a crunch match) at the same time. Next up he faces off against the nation he represented as a youngster, against team members with whom he has shared the dressing room.Netravalkar’s story is remarkably amazing.As a profile in The New York Times put it: “Such is the fine balance America’s newest — and perhaps most unlikely — sporting hero has had to strike to keep his cricket dreams alive that software engineer Saurabh Netravalkar has even been known to spend the lunch interval during club matches hunched over his work laptop, either coding or in a meeting with colleagues via video call. At last, however, all those hours spent juggling the demands of a full-time job with tech giant Oracle while simultaneously playing professional sports have finally paid off.”When he’s not bowling at Pakistan with the fury of an engineer asked to do a task without a valid JIRA ticket, Netravalkar’s day job is as a Principal Engineer at Oracle. And, as if being an international-level cricketer and a coder par excellence wasn’t enough to brag about, Netravalkar is also a talented Ukulele player and married to Devi Snighda Upalla, who also happens to be a Principal Oracle Engineer and a talented Kathak dancer whose Bolly X Fitness program is quite the rage. It would appear that talent and luck are not democratically allocated when it’s being handed out either by a higher being or evolution.Netravalkar’s meteoric rise as an Indian-American migrant comes at a time when folks of Indian origin can be found on both sides of the political spectrum as well as the upper echelons of American society with the exception of sports. It’s fair to say that of all immigrant groups – turning up on American shores for a better life – none have made their mark on America much like Indian-Americans. They are the highest-earning minority group. In politics, the so-called Samosa Caucus – a term to describe a modest number of Indian-Americans in Congress – has exploded on both sides of politics. On the Republican side, you’ve Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley, whilein the Democrats setup includes the vice-president Kamala Harris and several others serving in the House of Representatives. In business, Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella are the headliners among 21 billion-dollar companies that are led by Indian Americans. Even among Nobel Laureates, you have the likes of Amartya Sen, Abhijit Banerjee, and Venki Ramakrishnan but none of them appear to have ticked more than one box like Netravalkar.As one Instagram user put it: “Bro casually sings, works as an engineer full time, and owns Pakistan for a hobby.”So, how did Saurabh Netravalkar become the poster child of the Indian and American dream? It all started in the greatest cricketing city on the planet: Mumbai.The abode of many cricketing legends including Sachin Tendulkar , Sunil Gavaskar, Ravi Shastri, and current India captain Rohit Sharma, many youngsters grow up in the city with the hope of playing for India.Mumbai has won the most Ranji trophies with 42 wins in 88 seasons. The wide gulf in class is evident from the fact that the number 2 spot is held by Karnataka who have won the domestic tournament 8 times. But Mumbai’s success can also be a hindrance and it’s perhaps the hardest team to break into for any player. Even Sachin Tendulkar’s son Arjun – a nifty fast bowler – had to switch allegiances to Goa to get regular game time.But the odds didn’t appear to deter Netravalkar who came into the limelight in 2009 when he rattled Yuvraj Singh’s stump at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru. Yuvraj by then had already become part of Indian cricketing folklore after his stupendous India debut in the 2000 ICC Knock Out Trophy when he scored 84 unbeaten in 80 balls against an Aussie pace attack consisting of Bret Lee, Glen McGrath, and Jason Gillespie.Fortune seemed to be smiling on Netravalkar when he was called up for the BCCI Corporate Trophy where he shared the dressing room with the likes of Yuvraj Singh, Robin Uthappa, and Suresh Raina, while the opposing camp had Messrs Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni. He also had a superlative 2010 U-19 Cricket World Cup, where he was the leading wicket-taker for India. However, breaking into the senior setup proved more difficult. At that time, the Mumbai squad was teeming with pacers like Ajit Agarkar, Zaheer Khan, and others.Taking a call to give his cricket career a boost, he missed a full semester to focus on the game. Netravalkar made his Ranji debut in 2013 but being in and out of the team meant he bid adieu to the game he loved and took the more practical route of going back to his studies.Fate appeared to have shut the cricket door forever when Cornell University in New York in 2015 offered him a scholarship after being impressed with his player analysis app called CricDecode (If you search, you can still find the app’s code on the developer platform GitHub).After he graduated from Cornell, he was offered a job by Oracle in San Francisco and having left his cricket kit back home, started playing recreationally on weekends to fit in.Fate intervened when the ICC changed its rules – from four years to three years – for residents to represent their adopted nations. An H1B card holder, Netravalkar broke into the US squad in 2018 and even captained the team for three years.Like all cricket-crazy fans in India, Netrvalkar and his father Naresh watched many matches together in the 1990s and 2000s. His favorite bowlers were Wasim Akram, Chaminda Vaas, and Zaheer Khan. Perhaps those fantasies would have remained a dream had it not been for the US co-hosting the T20 Cricket World Cup as Netravalkar showed that he had what it takes to face off against the big boys. Incidentally, in 2010, in the Under-19 Cricket World Cup, Netravalkar faced heartbreak when Team India lost to the Pakistan team that had a young Babar Azam.On June 12, Netravalkar will face off against players he knows from a lifetime ago, whose exploits he might have followed on the news or social media.While Virat Kohli was in the opposing camp in the BCCI Corporate Championship, current captain Rohit Sharma was a senior in the Mumbai squad. Meanwhile, Surya Kumar Yadav, a batsman who has redefined T20 cricket with his avant-garde batting style was a contemporary in the Mumbai dressing room.Opposing coach Rahul Dravid, who watched him bowl the Super Over against Pakistan, is also someone he bowled to at the National Cricket Academy many years ago.In fact, there’s an almost epochal tinge to Netravalkar’s exponential rise in the first T20 tournament held in the land that Columbus thought he had discovered, and the one he actually discovered as Columbus as the USA faces off against the land that Columbus hoped to discover. That at the heart of the story would be a young man from Mumbai in US colours makes this an even greater tale.In the vintage video game Cricket ’97, the sagacious Richie Benaud had a line that went: “You know not much is wrong with the world when you can hear the sound of leather hitting the willow.” For a long time, the United States was one nation where the sound of willow and leather hitting was missing (unless one counts baseball) but all that looks set to change after this World Cup. Americans, not just the diaspora, appear to have fully embraced the sport and amid the heart of that has been an Oracle engineer simultaneously living the American and Indian dream. There are engineers who play cricket and cricketers who are engineers, but there's hardly anyone who is so proficient at both.In fact, there’s a video on his Instagram where Netravalkar, while watching the India vs Pakistan game says in chaste Marathi that would make even South Bombay residents stop in their tracks: “Definitely come on June 12 to support us on the ground.” Many fans – irrespective of their nationality or giving a fig about the Tebbit Test - would be forgiven if, for a small moment, they decide to back the young lad from Mumbai in US colours who dared to dream as he bowls against the likes of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.","Saurabh Netravalkar is a software engineer at tech giant Oracle. He is also a talented Ukulele player and married to Devi Snighda Upalla, who also happens to be a Principal Oracle Engineer and a talented Kathak dancer. His meteoric rise comes at a time when folks of Indian origin can be found on both sides of the political spectrum as well as the upper echelons of American society.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110944189,imgsize-129366,width-400,resizemode-4/110944189.jpg"

One of India's greatest batsmen Virender Sehwag needs no introduction; but Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan made an impression, possibly sarcastically because of his latest criticism by the former India opener, that he didn't exactly identify who the journalist mentioned in his question.Bangladesh are all but through to the 'Super 8s' stage of the T20 World Cup having won two of their three matches in Group D, including a win over former champions Sri Lanka.On Thursday, the 'Bengal Tigers' defeated Netherlands, after which a video clip of Shakib at the post-match press conference went viral.Listening to a mediaperson's question on Sehwag criticising his batting, the Bangladesh captain stopped the journalist in between and asked ""Who?"", and the clip, which ends at that moment, went viral.Journalist: ""There has been a lot of discussion about your performance, especially a comment by Virender Sehwag that has received much attention...""Shakib: ""Who?""However, the veteran allrounder, who rediscovered his batting form with a stroke-filled 64 not out of 46 deliveries in Bangladesh's 25-run win over Netherlands, did go on to complete his reply.""A player doesn't play to answer (the critics). His job is to contribute to the team. If he is not able to do that, there will be a lot of talk. I think it's not such a bad thing,"" he said.Sehwag had criticised Shakib for his poor run in the first two matches against Sri Lanka and South Africa.""If he was included in the squad for experience, then we were not able to see it. At least spend some time at this wicket! It is not like you are Hayden or Gilchrist who can play a pull shot off a short ball, you are just a player from Bangladesh. Play according to your standards. When you are not able to play hook or pull, so just play the strokes that you know,"" Sehwag had said on Cricbuzz.","Bangladesh are all but through to the 'Super 8s' stage of the T20 World Cup.

NEW YORK: Indian cricket fans got everything they wanted from the New York leg of the World Cup. In the makeshift Nassau County Ground , which will be dismantled over the next few days, the Men in Blue played three games which offered completely different flavours.While Ireland was a standard walk in the park, the Pakistan game had all the highs and lows that you can expect from a top-of-the-chart encounter. The match against USA, meanwhile, was a battle of attrition in which India triumphed after enduring a few difficult phases.Amid all this, there was one note that went just a little off-tune: the form of Virat Kohli . The thousands who filled the stands on all three days had one common wish, a meaningful contribution from their favourite superstar.Low scores of 1, 4 and 0 in three consecutive games isn't something that we have seen too often from the modern master, who came into the World Cup on the back of some magnificent knocks in the IPL Kohli was a superhit as an opener in the IPL, prompting captainRohit Sharma to book that slot for him in the T20 World Cup. The captain was also very categorical when he said that his and Kohli's are the only two slots that are ""fixed"", while the rest will move up and down ""as per the situation"".But in the three games here, Virat seemed to be unsure where his off-stump is, a problem that has plagued him in the past, notably during India's 2014 tour of England, when he had aggregated 137 runs from four Tests. That, however, is now ancient history and Kohli subsequently was able to completely turn things around against the moving ball.The conditions here in New York have been quite unique. The ball has completely dominated the bat. It's not just the movement but also the up-and-down nature of the track that has kept batters on their toes.What could have gone against Kohli was the fact that he joined the team a little late. He missed the practice match against Bangladesh at the venue and went into the tournament slightly undercooked.But the champion batter has put in a lot of effort in the nets to get it all sorted out. Two days before the Pakistan game, he batted for almost two hours and everything seemed to be coming from the middle of the bat.""We know what Virat brings to the table and how good he can be. Yes, he joined a bit late, but he is putting in all the hard work to get used to the conditions,"" Rohit had said on the eve of the match against Pakistan.It is true that Virat has looked good at the nets, but that form somehow hasn't translated into performances in the World Cup so far. The worrying bit is that there is a serious rain threat in Miami - the venue of India's final league game against Canada - and there could be a case where all their practice sessions get washed out. There is a question mark on the game itself on Sunday and that could mean Kohli might not get too much time to work on his batting before the Super-8s start.The team, however, has enough belief in their No. 1 batter. Shivam Dube, who also endured a bit of a rough patch explained, said, ""Who am I to talk about Kohli? If he hasn't got runs in three games, he may well get three hundreds in the next three and there will be no more discussions.""Rohit, of course, has the option of bringing in Yashasvi Jaiswal in as his opening partner and drop Kohli down to his regular No. 3 spot. But the captain doesn't want to do that because he believes the former skipper is best suited at the top and the team will not be able to include four allrounders if Kohli comes down the order.It's the faith the team management has in Kohli that has stopped them from taking any harsh decisions. It's now on the batting great to flick on that switch which will once again make us believe in the cliché that 'class is permanent'.","The batting superstar's poor run as opener is the only jarring note.

NEW YORK: From being a journeyman cricketer in Mumbai to becoming a coder for Oracle to now getting Virat Kohli out for a first-ball duck in a T20 World Cup , it has been a long and winding road for Saurabh Netravalkar .The left-arm pace bowler was the talking point of the World Cup after his match-winning Super Over against Pakistan. Now, just to prove he is no flash in the pan, Netravalkar has followed up that performance with the wickets of Kohli and ""old mate"" Rohit Sharma .It's a surreal turn of events for the 32-year-old who once nearly gave up on the game. ""It is difficult to explain that journey in a couple of sentences. It's been really very long. Back then, I had to take a practical call when I saw that my career as a cricketer in India wasn't really taking off because of the talent around. I got a chance to study in a reputed university here and it was a decision to pursue my other love, coding,"" Netravalkar said.Indian journalists, incidentally, chose to skip the media interaction with Man of the Match Arshdeep Singh just to have a conversation with this mild-natured boy who has seen difficult days in his life.Netravalkar is multi-talented. He plays the ukulele as well quite well, which he says he does for ""fun"". ""I see YouTube videos and try to get the tune right, it's just a hobby,"" the boy from Mumbai, who now works in Silicon Valley , said.""I am just happy that I can pursue both my passions. It is all happening very fast and I am in the process of digesting it. These last two games were really high-profile,"" he added, as references to his dismissal of Rohit and Kohli. ""It was an emotional moment to get Virat's wicket. I was looking to hit off-stump and it worked out well,"" he said.While Rohit and Suryakumar Yadav know him well and congratulated him on his performance, Virat, too, acknowledged his effort after the game got over.""I know Surya from my U-15, U-17 days, we were talking about our dressing-room banter. I didn't know Virat personally but he did congratulate me,"" Netravalkar said, exuding humility.India's bowling coach Paras Mhambrey, a Mumbai man himself, said the other day that Netravalkar is an ""inspiration"". ""If there is a seed of hope, keep watering it. The plant will happen, it may take time, but it's going to happen,"" Netravalkar said, getting slightly emotional with all the adulation.For USA, there is serious business up ahead with Ireland up next. The game is in Fort Lauderdale in Miami and if it gets washed out, the co-hosts will go through.""We are not thinking about the rain. Ireland are a good side and we have to beat them. If our performances help the sport grow here and become part of the school and college curriculum, we will know we are on the right track.""","Saurabh Netravalkar was the talking point of the World Cup after his match- winning Super Over against Pakistan.

The 25-year-old was subsequently dropped for the next match against India, which Pakistan lost by six runs.After the match, a video surfaced on social media showing Khan eating street food late at midnight in New York.Khan faced extensive trolling on social media platforms for his actions.Former Pakistan captain and Team Director Mohammad Hafeez criticised Khan on Friday, revealing some shocking details about him.Hafeez, appointed as Team Director in November last year, was sacked by the PCB just three months later following the team's embarrassing 3-0 Test series loss to Australia and a 4-1 T20I series defeat to New Zealand.During his tenure, Hafeez supported Khan in the New Zealand series, but the son of former Pakistan wicketkeeper Moin Khan failed to meet Hafeez's expectations.In a program on a local sports channel, Hafeez called Khan unprofessional and stated that the 25-year-old is not ready to play international cricket.""(On meeting Azam Khan for the first time) Azam Khan, if you want to play cricket for Pakistan, you need to do two things. First, you have to try your best to get physically fit, which is the requirement at the international level. Second, whenever you get an opportunity, you have to perform. I also want you to work hard on your wicket-keeping abilities because with your current fitness, you can't do fielding,"" Hazeez said while speaking to a local sports channel in Pakistan.""I connected Azam Khan with the incumbent Pakistan trainer and shared all the plans with him. Regardless of his body weight and body fat level, I told him that I don't care about that; all I cared about is that you needed to bring your fat level down and improve your running abilities. You need to increase your running abilities so that the team's balance doesn't get affected during the game,"" Hafeez said.""After allotting him a 6-week program, when Azam Khan appeared, he was still at the same body weight and body fat level as he was 6 weeks prior. His running ability was also twice as low as the rest of the team. If the rest of the team could cover 2 kilometers in 10 minutes, Azam Khan could only do it in 20 minutes. So, I went to talk to him and asked him why he didn't follow the plan and role given to him. He didn't have any answer, saying he tried his best but couldn't. This is unprofessionalism,"" the former Pakistan cricketer said.""Then, Azam Khan got another chance and played three matches. I found that this guy is not ready to play international cricket. I told him again that if you want to play for Pakistan, you need to show more commitment. But I didn't see that commitment in him. After three matches, I rested him and informed the selectors about my findings regarding him. Now, it's up to them to decide whether to play him in the future or not?,"" an angry Hafeez said.Khan has played 14 T20Is so far and scored just 88 runs at an average of 8.80.",Azam Khan was dismissed for a duck in his maiden T20 World Cup outing.

NEW YORK: Going into the game against USA, the form of Shivam Dube was a bit of a concern for the Indian team. He has been selected as a 'designated hitter' in the middle-overs but things were not falling in place for the lefthander. In fact, Dube's lean patch didn't actually start in the T20 World Cup either, but in the latter half of the IPL when he was playing for Chennai Super Kings He had a magnificent first phase which got him the ticket to the World Cup, but after that the performances tapered off. Dube, who scored 31 not out off 35 balls to help India cross the line against the USA, conceded that he was feeling the heat of a lean patch over the last one and a half months.""Yes, I was thinking about it, but there was no self-doubt. Here the conditions are such that I can't bat the way I bat for CSK . It demands a different way of batting and I was looking to do that,"" Dube said.There were phases in Wednesday's game when the left-hander struggled, but to his credit he didn't give his wicket away. It took him a while to hit his first six of the tournament, which went a long way in releasing the pressure. ""This long a wait to hit a six? It might have happened in Ranji Trophy , but not in IPL, but the pitch is really difficult here. The ball sometimes shoots up, sometimes keeps low, moves around. I'm sure you have never seen a pitch like this in a T20 World Cup before,"" Dube said.Range hitting is something that the man with long levers is used to doing, but that hasn't been the case for him here. In fact, even during training, it has been more about survival than hitting, which Dube concedes is ""a little difficult"".""But the coaches, support-staff told me that I have the ability to deal with this and I will definitely not delete this from my memory,"" the 30-year-old said.His 67-run partnership with Suryakumar Yadav finally helped India win beat the USA and the Mumbai cricketer said that the pair knew it all was about dealing with the difficult phase.

T20 World Cup 2024: India's Super 8 Group

NEW DELHI: West Indies have cruised into the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup with a 13-run victory over New Zealand on Wednesday. This win, their third in Group C, sees them topping the group with six points. Despite a shaky start, where they were reduced to 30-5 and then 76-7, Sherfane Rutherford's blistering unbeaten 68, including six sixes, propelled them to a competitive 149-9 in this low-scoring tournament.New Zealand's chase was derailed early, and despite Glenn Phillips' 40, they managed only 136-9. Alzarri Joseph (4-19) and Gudakesh Motie (3-25) were the standout bowlers for the West Indies. This defeat leaves New Zealand at the bottom of Group C with slim hopes of progressing.As the group stage of the tournament edges towards its climax, numerous teams have solidified their positions in the Super Eight. India leads Group A, while Australia secures the top spot in Group B. West Indies dominates Group C, and South Africa leads Group D. Afghanistan emerges as a strong contender to claim the second spot from Group C, boasting victories in both of their matches thus far.Several notable teams face significant challenges to secure their spots in the Super Eight:- Pakistan, New Zealand, and Sri Lanka are currently lagging behind due to inconsistent performances in their respective groups.- England is in a precarious position. To advance, they must win their remaining match decisively to gain four points and improve their net run rate. Additionally, they need Scotland to lose their final group stage match to bolster their chances.The Super 8 round of the T20 World Cup 2024 will involve predetermined seedings for the top 8 teams, regardless of their performance in the group stage. This means that even if their rankings differ, their seeding positions will remain the same. In case any of the top 8 teams fail to qualify for the Super 8 stage, the team with the most points will take their spot but will assume the original team's seeding.The teams and their seedings are as follows:Even if the West Indies finish at the top of Group C, they will still hold the C2 seeding. On the other hand, if New Zealand does not qualify, they will nonetheless be designated as C1.The Super 8 round of the T20 World Cup 2024 features two groups, each composed of four teams. The teams are grouped based on their pre-determined seedings, ensuring a competitive mix in each group. Here are the groups for the Super 8 stage:Group 1: A1 (India), B2 (Australia), C1 (New Zealand), D2 (Sri Lanka)Group 2: A2 (Pakistan), B1 (England), C2 (West Indies), D1 (South Africa)India's position as the top team in Group A (A1) has been solidified according to pre-determined seedings. They'll be joined in the Super 8 group by teams B2, C1, and D2. Interestingly, despite accruing more points than the defending champions, Australia finds itself in this group as the second-seeded team from Group B, following England's lead.A marquee match between India and Australia is already scheduled for June 24 at the Darren Sammy Cricket Ground in Saint Lucia, promising an intense showdown for cricket fans worldwide.However, India's schedule might undergo alterations due to the uncertain fate of New Zealand and Sri Lanka in the tournament. Both teams have suffered consecutive losses, leaving them at the bottom of the points table. Instead of New Zealand, Afghanistan will step in to fill their place in India's group. Instead of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh or Netherlands may qualify in India's group.As the Super Eight stage approaches, the excitement and intensity of the T20 World Cup 2024 are ramping up. Fans are eagerly watching to see how the remaining spots will be filled and which teams will advance in this thrilling tournament.","West Indies cruised into the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup with a 13-run victory over New Zealand on Wednesday.

"T20 World Cup: Do not write off Virat Kohli, says Wasim Jaffer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-do-not-write-off-virat-kohli-says-wasim-jaffer/articleshow/110975958.cms,"NEW YORK: Former India cricketer Wasim Jaffer is confident that charismatic batsman Virat Kohli will showcase his true potential and brilliance in the crucial stages of the Men's T20 World Cup . This belief comes despite Kohli's underwhelming performance in the New York leg of India's campaign, where he scored a mere five runs in three innings.Kohli entered the tournament on a high note, having been the top run-scorer in IPL 2024 with an impressive 741 runs in 15 matches while opening the batting for Royal Challengers Bengaluru . However, in the T20 World Cup, he has struggled on challenging pitches, scoring 1, 4, and 0 in India's first three Group A games at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium.""Rohit and Virat have been playing on the tough New York pitch so they aren't quite among the top run-scorers. But do not write off Virat Kohli. As the tournament will get to its business end, he will show his true colors and he will show his greatness. I had picked Virat Kohli as the highest run-scorer and I will stick to him,"" said Jaffer in a video on his Youtube channel.Jaffer dismissed the idea of Kohli moving back to the number three position, pointing out that Rishabh Pant has settled well in that role.""I don't think Virat Kohli should bat at No. 3. He should continue to open because now you have got Rishabh Pant at No. 3 and now it has been working out really well. You ideally want a left-hand right-hand opening combination and while you have Jaiswal, that doesn't seem possible.""Additionally, Jaffer expressed his desire for India to adopt a more proactive approach in their power-play batting in the upcoming matches. He believes that a more aggressive strategy could benefit the team's performance.""You will need to be proactive in the powerplay. You will reach nowhere if you play cautiously on such pitches because the bowler knows he has to bowl on a spot and let the pitch do the rest. We have seen players like Rishabh Pant get rewarded for their bravery and that's the way you need to play with the powerplay restrictions.""With India's final Group A game against Canada scheduled for June 15 in Florida, Jaffer suggests that there might be an opportunity for Sanju Samson to bat at number four, provided they decide to leave out Shivam Dube, who contributed an unbeaten 31 off 35 balls in the seven-wicket victory over USA in New York.""There might be a case for Sanju Samson at No. 4. But then Shivam Dube has got just a couple of games and the team management will want to give him a longer run. Whether Samson will play, whether Jaiswal will play, these decisions are something that the team management will need to think about going forward,"" he concluded.","Former India cricketer Wasim Jaffer is confident that charismatic batsman Virat Kohli will showcase his true potential and brilliance in the crucial stages of the Men's T20 World Cup.

NEW DELHI: West Indies cricketing icon Brian Lara expressed his unwavering support for co-hosts USA, rather than Pakistan , to progress through to the Super 8 stage of the ongoing T20 World Cup .The legendary batsman, renowned for his unparalleled prowess and illustrious career, unequivocally endorsed the American team's prospects of advancing further in the competition, while seemingly dismissing Pakistan's chances of making it to the next round.Lara acknowledged that Pakistan still have a realistic chance to progress to the latter stages of the tournament. Despite this, he believes that the USA will accompany India in advancing from Group A to the Super 8 round.""Of course mathematically they (Pakistan) have a chance. I think the USA just got to take care of a win in their last game, they do that and they qualify. But we’re hoping that they get to win plus the USA lose their game. So my money is on the USA, I think they’re full of confidence and they would want to make it to the Super 8 that will be so huge, historic for US cricket,"" Lara said while speaking on Star SportsThe former world champions Pakistan had a dismal start to their 2024 T20 World Cup campaign as they were handed defeat at the hands of the USA in their opening encounter in Dallas.Following the humiliating Super-Over loss to the USA, Pakistan lost to arch-rivals India in the blockbuster clash in New York.Team India currently leads the Group A with six points followed by USA with four points and Pakistan are placed third in standings as the 2022 runners-up are struggling to find their way to next round and stare at the Group stage exit.At the moment, Pakistan hold an advantage over the USA in terms of net run rate (NRR), despite suffering two losses and securing only one victory.By defeating Ireland, Pakistan can maintain its NRR lead over the USA. If Ireland emerge victorious against the USA and Pakistan register a win in their concluding Group A match, Babar and Co. will enter the Super 8 phase of the T20 World Cup.For the co-hosts USA to progress, they require at least a point against Ireland.Should Pakistan falter and lose a point, the USA will secure their place in the Super 8 phase.Both matches are scheduled to take place in Lauderhill , and in the event of a washout in either game, the USA will automatically qualify for the Super 8 stage.",Brian Lara believes co-hosts USA will progress to the Super 8 stage of the T20 World Cup.

I missed Tokyo and I wasn't anywhere close to representing the country,"" Bopanna said on Thursday.The 44-year-old Karnataka lad will be pairing with Tamil Nadu's Sriram Balaji in Paris after the All India Tennis Association went along with Bopanna's choice of partner.Bopanna earned automatic qualification by virtue of his world No. 4 ranking -- the top 10 ranked players in men's and women's doubles are given direct acceptance and can choose a player ranked in the top-300 as their partner.Sumit Nagal, ranked 77 in singles as on Monday -- the ranking cut-off date for Olympics entries, is on the list of alternates.June 14 is the deadline for national federations to submit their nominations to the ITF, which will announce the final list on July 4.The tennis competition will be played at Roland Garros, where Bopanna had won the mixed doubles crown with Canada's Gabriela Dabrowski in 2017.He will be at his best in terms of form and mental space too, despite being the oldest player on the ATP Tour.""I have been playing very good tennis.

He had nothing to lose and played freely (during the French Open).""It is a great opportunity for him.

She started working with Bopanna a little more than a year ago and has played a key role in prolonging his career.""Balu has been working with Balaji too (as part of the 'Doubles Dream of India' project), and knows his game really well. I have seen him (Balachandran) for 25 years, having someone familiar on your side is always a good thing. Rebecca is the most important member of my team. I am 44 now, recovery is a key aspect of my game at this stage.""Bopanna and Balaji will look to play together in a couple of tournaments in the lead up to the Olympics.""We plan to play a couple of tournaments after Wimbledon, maybe Hamburg and Umag.

The decision was reached during a selection committee meeting, presided over by Nandan Bal, a former Davis Cup Captain.

I feel more calm with the plan I have and just really grateful to be back,"" said Osaka, attributing her good form to being ""more comfortable returning and accepting mistakes as they come.""The first set remained on serve until the sixth game, with both players struggling to adapt to the windy conditions.Osaka then seized control, breaking Lamens' serve with a series of powerful shots from both wings, aided by unforced errors from the Dutchwoman. More mistakes from Lamens in her next service game handed Osaka the first set 6-2 in just 26 minutes.Osaka continued her dominance at the start of the second set, breaking Lamens' first service game with a string of winners to take a 3-0 lead. The match concluded as Lamens hit another groundstroke into the net.Despite admitting that grass is not her preferred surface, with her four Grand Slam titles coming on the hard courts of the US and Australian Opens, Osaka appears to be gradually regaining the form that once took her to the top of the world rankings.She has never advanced beyond the third round at Wimbledon but recently pushed eventual French Open champion Iga Swiatek to match point in the second round, the toughest challenge the world number one faced on the Parisian clay.","Former world number one Naomi Osaka beats Suzan Lamens in straight sets.
