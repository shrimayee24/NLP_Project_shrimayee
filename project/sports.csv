Drew McIntyre suspended by Adam Pearce after WWE Money in the Bank incident,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/drew-mcintyre-suspended-by-adam-pearce-after-wwe-money-in-the-bank-incident/articleshow/111579085.cms,"Will Drew McIntyre continue to appear on WWE RAW after Money in the Bank 2024?

In a shocking turn of events, Drew McIntyre and CM Punk have been penalized heavily following their fight at the Money in the Bank Premium Live Event. Adam Pearce , the General Manager of WWE RAW has decided to suspend Drew McIntyre for assaulting him following a violent altercation between the two.During Saturday's event, Drew McIntyre, who had secured victory in the men's Money in the Bank match earlier that evening, decided to cash in his contract on WWE World Heavyweight Champion Damian Priest, amid a match against Seth Rollins.This unexpected move turned the bout into a triple-threat match.Amid the chaos, CM Punk made a surprise appearance and launched an assault on McIntyre, going so far as to choke him with a cable. In a fit of rage, McIntyre retaliated after the event, attacking backstage personnel and even landing an elbow on Adam Pearce.In the lead-up to this week's episode of RAW, the General Manager of the franchise took strict action against both McIntyre and Punk. Adam Pearce imposed fines on both wrestlers. He also announced McIntyre's indefinite suspension for his aggressive conduct towards Pearce.Addressing the incident, Pearce stated, ""The elephant in the room — everybody saw what happened at Money in the Bank and after. As a result, after careful consideration, I'm hereby fining both CM Punk and Drew McIntyre an undisclosed amount for their actions. Furthermore, due to putting his elbow in my teeth, I'm hereby officially suspending Drew McIntyre indefinitely. More to come tomorrow night live on Raw.”When Punk made his last appearance on ""WWE SmackDown"" on June 21, the Scottish celebrity attacked him and left him covered in blood. Punk was from Chicago. Following through on his pledge to never let McIntyre win a world title, ""The Second City Saint"" exacted retribution on McIntyre at Money in the Bank. Punk, who hasn't competed in a match since the 2024 Royal Rumble, may be getting close to making a comeback because he stated during the post-Money in the Bank news conference that he is feeling great and is eager to go after healing from his triceps injury.Even though Drew got suspended indefinitely after his Money in the Bank incident involving the General Manager of WWE RAW, we might see him making a surprise appearance on Monday Night RAW. McIntyre was visibly annoyed with how things rolled out for him which gives us the impression that the Scottish fighter will not sit silent.","Drew McIntyre and CM Punk have been penalized heavily following their fight at the Money in the Bank Premium Live Event.

Seth Rollins Comments on Becky Lynch’s Free Agency Status,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/seth-rollins-comments-on-becky-lynchs-free-agency-status/articleshow/111574312.cms,"Becky Lynch might receive the largest contract in women’s history

Becky Lynch recently saw her Women's World Championship slip away to Liv Morgan at WWE King & Queen of the Ring. Undeterred and driven to reclaim her title, Lynch sought a rematch against Morgan on RAW last month. Despite her best efforts, she was unable to secure a victory. Currently, Lynch is navigating the uncertain waters of free agency , making her status a hot topic of discussion.Seth Rollins has recently addressed this situation, shedding light on her current state.On the May 27th edition of Monday Night RAW, Liv Morgan successfully defended her Women's World Championship against Becky Lynch in a highly anticipated steel cage match. Lynch fought with relentless determination, but Morgan managed to retain her title. This match was significant as it marked Lynch's last WWE appearance for the time being, due to her current status as a free agent.In an interview during the Countdown to Money in The Bank show, Michael Cole sat down with Seth Rollins to discuss Becky Lynch's status following her WWE departure. Rollins provided some insights, although he remained discreet about her future plans. Seth Rollins assured fans that Becky Lynch is doing well. He highlighted her positive spirit but chose not to reveal specific details about her future endeavors. Rollins also gave an update on their daughter, Roux, noting that she is thriving and keeping them busy.""The Man’s great. She’s great. I can’t speak to her future or what she’s got moving forward, but she’s great, she’s in good spirits. The little one’s awesome as well. She’s a menace, she runs the ship,” Rollins shared.In related news, a former WWE writer suggested that Becky Lynch should aim for a contract on par with the lucrative deals of top stars like Randy Orton. It is widely expected that Lynch will receive one of the mostsubstantial contract offers in the history of women's wrestling. As fans and analysts eagerly anticipate Lynch's next move, it is evident that her opportunities are vast, and the world is indeed her oyster.Lynch’s career in WWE came at an untimely halt and a lot of it might be owing to her losses against Liv Morgan. She lost at the Women’s World Championship as well as at a rematch with the same star.She did not resign with WWE but sources have claimed that Lynch has been receiving mindblowing offers that can prove to be lucrative for this former WWE star. There are possibilities that Lynch might join AEW or somewhere similar.","Becky Lynch recently saw her Women's World Championship slip away to Liv Morgan at WWE King & Queen of the Ring.

Watch India Tour of Zimbabwe T20I series on Sony Sports network

NEW DELHI: India didn't anticipate that their five-match series against underdogs Zimbabwe would begin as it did. They suffered a surprising defeat at the hands of the African nation in the opening T20I. However, the Shubman Gill-led side bounced back impressively, delivering a dominant performance to secure a 100-run victory in the second match, with Abhishek Sharma smashing a century filled with sixes.With the series now tied at 1-1, the competition has entered an exciting phase.India will look to build on their resurgence and maintain their dominance, while Zimbabwe will seek to spring surprises against the world champions.Former Zimbabwe cricketer Hamilton Masakadza is confident that Zimbabwe possesses all the necessary tools to put Team India under pressure and achieve positive results in the remaining three matches.TimesofIndia.com recently spoke with Masakadza, who played 38 Tests, 209 ODIs, and 66 T20Is for Zimbabwe from 2001 to 2019, in an exclusive interview. He discussed Zimbabwe cricket, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma 's retirement, and much more. Excerpts:When I finished playing, I moved over to the administrative side. I served as the Director of Cricket. I've recently completed my tenure in that role and am now looking forward to what the near future holds. I held the position of Director of Cricket at Zimbabwe Cricket for four years, and I have just finished that stint.That's the beauty of T20 cricket – anything can happen on the day. It's a bit different from 50 overs and Test cricket in that performances need to be sustained over longer periods and involve more players. In T20 cricket, one person can change the game on the day. So, I see us having a very good chance, much like the Indian side as well. We've been using the T20 format for a while now as a breeding ground and platform to introduce new players. Our team is also slightly younger, with a few fresh faces looking forward to making their mark in the international setup. We're really looking forward to it. Our team is missing most of the senior, more established players who play in the other two formats, but we're eager to see what these younger players can achieve at the international level.Obviously, it's exciting for us every time India tours us. It's always something to really look forward to. There's a lot of talent in the Indian team, and many players are competing for spots in the senior side. We used to have them quite frequently, where they would select the best performers from the IPL and then come straight to Zimbabwe. They did this for three or four years in a row with players like Raina and Kohli. It's exciting that India is back on our shores. Playing against India is always a significant challenge for any team.As I mentioned before, in T20 cricket, the format often leads to results going differently. The main difference from longer formats is that you need more than one person to perform consistently, and those who do perform must sustain it longer. In T20 cricket, one individual can easily change the game or even win it single-handedly for their team. So, we're really looking forward to it. I believe we have a good chance, especially playing at home against a slightly younger Indian side. We're eager to put them under pressure and confident we can achieve positive results. As you mentioned, we might even sneak the series.It's a slightly younger side with some of the senior guys not coming. Virat had an absolutely brilliant T20I career. I watched him throughout and it was really impressive to see how he mostly came up in those big clutch moments. These guys are hungry to play, but it's not an easy task to make it into the Indian team. The players who have come over will realize that and they'll be relishing the opportunity. Even though it's a younger side, they are very accomplished players. In IPL cricket, some have already played international cricket. So yeah, there's good competitiveness, and it's going to be exciting to see the new talent and what they bring to the table.I think the philosophy has been to play a very exciting brand of cricket, and that's exactly how we approach the game as well. So, we're looking forward to that. The team is very positive, aggressive, and always opts for the positive approach whenever they have the chance. They go out there to play and put the opposition under pressure. Sikandar has been quite brilliant for us over the past three years or so, in all formats. He's really performed very well. As you mentioned, he's been playing in all the leagues, including the IPL, so he's learned a lot and gained valuable experience as a leader. I'm really looking forward to his leadership because, as I mentioned, he's a very positive and aggressive player, and I expect his captaincy to reflect that positivity. He will always opt for the more aggressive approach whenever he gets the chance.Yes, we're looking forward to a few more teams coming to our shores before the year is over. We're playing against India now, followed by an away match. Towards the end of the year, we're expecting Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Ireland to come and play as well. It's something we really anticipate. Our home games have been fantastic in terms of fan support. The fans have been brilliant and awesome in the last qualifiers we had. We even had to close the gates because we didn't have any more space for our fans. They've been really supportive. Any team coming to play cricket in Zimbabwe can expect a great atmosphere and strong home support, which really motivates the boys. It has also been beneficial for the opposition because some teams have come here and picked up on the songs that our supporters sing, taking them back home, which shows the impact our home crowd has on them. So yes, we're looking forward to more cricket and more support at home. We have three more series lined up at the end of the year.Yes, I think in this modern era, with the leagues growing the way they are, we expect more players to start getting called up. The challenge is quite different from international cricket because you end up playing alongside players you normally compete against. This allows you to learn from people outside your usual circles. It's very beneficial for players to participate in these leagues, and we look forward to more players being picked, not only for the IPL but for other leagues worldwide as well. We've already seen Blessing Muzarabani being called up, and Sikandar Raza, Sean Williams, and young Richard have also started receiving call-ups. We hope to see more players getting similar opportunities. We've seen the significant impact leagues and international call-ups have had on teams like Afghanistan, where almost their entire team plays in leagues. Their improvement as a team is evident because of this. So yes, it's something we're looking forward to, and we hope more players will have these opportunities.It was very disappointing that we didn't make it through to the recently concluded T20 World Cup in the West Indies and America. We know exactly where we made errors and fell short. We're looking forward to the next qualifiers and correcting the mistakes we made in the last qualifiers. We aim to return to the biggest stage. Zimbabwe is a team that can spring surprises, as we did in the World Cup in Australia when we beat Pakistan. We believe our team should be at all major tournaments, so it was really disappointing not to qualify for the recent one. But we're looking forward to the upcoming qualifiers and making it to the next T20 World Cup.Sometimes it's been guys making the wrong decisions at the wrong times. A big part of cricket is being able to read situations and react to different challenges better. So, I think that's where we're falling short a little bit. Some of our decision-making as individuals and as a team has been found wanting. But that's expected when you have a younger group of players coming together, and they are slightly inexperienced. However, I'm sure they have learned a lot from the qualifiers and recent series, including the matches we just had in Bangladesh. The players are growing all the time, and I think they are on the right path towards rectifying their mistakes.The biggest reason why we haven't crossed the line in recent times has been not reacting well enough to pressure and not handling the situations effectively that have been presented to us. This is something the players will learn from, and they will learn quickly.I think Rinku is a very good power hitter, clean hitter of the ball, and a very good finisher. So, he's just one of the batters that we obviously have to look at. I think Parag has also been doing very well, as well as Jaiswal, Gill, and the list is endless. As I mentioned, we're expecting some tough competition. Personally, I'm really looking forward to seeing Rinku kick on. I know he's already had a few games for India, but he hasn't really had a solid run and a solid spot in the team, which I think he'll have on this tour. So, I'm looking forward to watching how he will play. He's a very exciting player and a very good finisher, so I'm looking forward to seeing what he brings to the table in Zimbabwe.A brilliant career. Cricket will be poorer. T20 cricket will be poorer after they've left. Just to say thank you for all the memories they've left us. They really entertained us a lot and left us with many memories. Jadeja is the ultimate competitor, both with ball and in the field. He obviously changed his game towards the end of his career to be a bit more aggressive and to kick on a bit earlier, showing us a different side of him. His selflessness, along with all his skills as a captain and his technical and tactical astuteness, were lovely to watch.Virat is really the player for the big occasion, the player for the big game. His big match temperament was exemplary to watch. So yeah, just to say a big well done to all three for such sterling T20 careers, and we're looking forward to watching more of them in other formats as well. At least we still have them with us, and we'll still be entertained by them. But a big well done for all the work they did in the T20 format, especially for winning the World Cup in their last outing for India. They did well in all three T20 careers.It is a big void, difficult to replace such players. But then again, with India, the pool of players is so wide and there's so much talent there. I'm sure India won't struggle to find players to replace them. But yeah, to find players who can reach the levels that those three did is going to be really difficult. I'm really looking forward to watching the growth and improvement, especially of Shubman Gill. I've watched a little bit of him in all three formats and I really love what I've seen. He's one player who can really step up to replace the guys who are leaving. Yashasvi as well. He started off brilliantly in his international career. So those are definitely a couple of players to look out for, players who can go a long way towards filling the huge void left by those world-class players.","Hamilton Masakadza played 38 Tests, 209 ODIs, and 66 T20Is for Zimbabwe from 2001 to 2019.

Vaughan pointed out their underwhelming record in recent ICC tournaments despite their significance in the team.""They'll all agree that it is a perfect way to go, but they should have won more white-ball trophies amongst them,"" Vaughan said on the Club Prairie Fire podcast. ""To think that he (Rohit) has taken another seventeen years to get another one in his hand, I think he will be the first one to admit that they should have won one or two more.""Kohli was the first to announce his retirement after receiving the Player of the Match award in the World Cup final.

Despite nearly an hour-long wait for the weather to clear, match officials eventually called off the game, resulting in both teams sharing a point each from the rain-affected match.This encounter was notable as it marked the first time any team had surpassed 200 runs this season and also the first occurrence of the 200-run total at Church Street Park.Earlier, Texas Super Kings, led by skipper Faf du Plessis , set a formidable total of 203 for 5 in their 20 overs. Du Plessis scored a brilliant century off 58 balls, leading his team from the front. Devon Conway provided crucial support, amassing 39 runs off 26 balls, and together they built a 109-run partnership for the opening wicket.Du Plessis was relentless against any loose deliveries, consistently punishing the Washington bowlers throughout his innings. Marcus Stoinis, despite nursing an injured right hand, contributed a vital 29 runs off 18 balls.The Washington Freedom's bowling and fielding were subpar, with several dropped catches and missed opportunities that allowed the Texas Super Kings to amass their substantial total.While the rain ultimately denied what could have been an exciting finish, both teams will aim to build on their performances as the Major League Cricket season progresses.","The fifth match of the 2024 Major League Cricket season between Washington Freedom and Texas Super Kings was called off due to rain.

If they want, they are most welcome but I guess they would want rest,"" the source added.With Rohit unavailable, Pandya appears to be the frontrunner for the captaincy role. However, KL Rahul, who recently captained the ODI team in South Africa, remains a strong contender and cannot be discounted from the selection process.","Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli likely to be given break from ODI series.

Following an extended break for personal reasons, Kishan returned to play in the Indian Premier League . However, he has not secured a spot in the national squad since his break from international cricket last December.Kishan has now provided reasons for his breaks, which eventually led to his removal from the Board of Control for Cricket in India's ( BCCI ) central contracts list.""I took a break, and I think it was normal. There is a rule that if you want to make a comeback, you must perform in domestic cricket. It is as simple as that. Now, it was very different for me to play domestic cricket as it was not making any sense. I was not in a frame of mind to play and that is why I took a break from international cricket. It doesn't make sense that you take a break from international cricket and then you go and play domestic matches.

India vs Zimbabwe: Abhishek Sharma's secret? A borrowed bat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/india-vs-zimbabwe-abhishek-sharmas-secret-a-borrowed-bat/articleshow/111563982.cms,"Abhishek Sharma announced his arrival on the international stage with a sizzling century in the second T20I of his career against Zimbabwe at the Harare Sports Club on Sunday, and he did it with a borrowed bat.After scoring 100 off 47 balls, which powered India to a mammoth 234 for 2 and eventually helped the visitors win by 100 runs to level the five-match series at 1-1, the 23-year-old Abhishek revealed that he did with skipper Shubman Gill 's bat.""Today I played with Shubman Gill's bat...whenever I think there is a pressure game or this is a match where I should perform, I usually take his bat,"" said the batting sensation, who, like Gill, hails from Punjab and is also mentored by India great Yuvraj Singh.Coming out to open, Abhishek smashed 8 sixes and 7 fours in his innings that came at a strike rate of 212.77, before being dismissed by left-arm spinner Wellington Masakadza.Ruturaj Gaikwad contributed an equally blistering 77 not out off 47 balls, followed by Rinku Singh who smashed an unbeaten 48 off 22 balls.Pacers Avesh Khan and Mukesh Kumar then took three wickets each to complete India's big win.Abhishek and Gill have been playing together since their under-12 days.“It has been quite beautiful, starting as kids of 11-12 years...When I was selected for the country, the first call I received was from Shubman,” said Abhishek in the post-match press conference.Abhishek said it's not the first time he borrowed Gill's bat.“It happened from the under-12 days, as whenever I play a pressure game I ask him for a bat. It had happened in the IPL as well. Today was no exception as it went well as it usually happens,” said Abhishek, who played IPL 2024 for Sunrisers Hyderabad and knocked on BCCI selectors' doors with his big-hitting prowess.The left-handed opener credited his father and Yuvraj for his success and ability to play fearlessly.“Yuvi paaji has made a big contribution. I don't consider myself as sixer-king or something like that. Special thanks to my dad for allowing me to play lofted shots. Generally, coaches don't allow a young batter to hit lofted shots. But my dad always said if you wanted to play a lofted shot, then it should go out of the ground. So I wanted to follow that,” he added.India lost the first match of the series, where Abhishek made his debut and got out for a duck. However, he said he didn't feel any pressure.“I think the IPL plays a big role in this (handling pressure). We did not feel much pressure when we came here to represent the country as debutants. Unfortunately, we didn't start well in the first match. But my mindset and approach were pretty much similar – to show the right intent,” he explained.“Of course, my execution was better today (in the 2nd T20I ) than yesterday. I was just calculating the risk that I should take in the first over, or whether to play according to the merit of the ball. Whenever I get boundaries or sixes in the first few balls, then I believe that it's my day,” he concluded.",India beat Zimbabwe by 100 runs in second T20I at Harare Sports Club.

Points Table

NEW DELHI: The San Francisco Unicorns secured a commanding win against the LA Knight Riders in the fourth match of the 2024 Major League Cricket , triumphing by six wickets with 28 balls remaining. Opting to field first at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, the Unicorns limited the Knight Riders to 165/6, thanks to the efforts of debutant Broady Couch (2/24) and Harris Rauf (2/38), who claimed two wickets each.The Unicorns' chase was propelled by scintillating half-centuries from Finn Allen (63) and Matthew Short (58).Despite Andre Russel 's (40*) valiant effort, it proved insufficient for the Knight Riders, as their key batsmen, including David Miller (24), Shakib Al Hassan (35), and Jason Roy (26), failed to make the most of their starts.The Unicorns' pursuit began with the early dismissal of opener Jake Fraser Mcgurk (9), caught behind off Spencer Johnson's bowling. However, Finn Allen wasted no time in attacking the target, smashing five sixes in just five deliveries across the fifth and sixth overs. By the end of the powerplay, the Unicorns held a commanding position at 67/1.Following the powerplay, opener Matthew Short shifted into high gear, striking two more sixes off Corne Dry in the seventh over. Allen reached his half-century in 23 deliveries in the eighth over, while Short followed suit, also in 23 balls, with five sixes and three fours. The massive 116-run partnership between Allen and Short was eventually broken by Sunil Narine in the 12th over, but by then, the Unicorns needed only 29 runs from 48 balls.Although Finn Allen fell to Spencer Johnson in the 13th over, contributions from Josh Inglis (15), Corey Anderson (11), and Hassan Khan (2) helped the Unicorns reach their target in 15.2 overs. Spencer Johnson emerged as the Knight Riders' most successful bowler, taking 3/36.Earlier, the Unicorns had kept the Knight Riders in check, reducing them to 42/2 by the end of the powerplay, having dismissed Sunil Narine (6) and Unmukt Chand (0). Opener Jason Roy (26) appeared threatening, striking four boundaries in his 18-ball innings before being bowled by Liam Plunkett in the seventh over.Experienced campaigners Shakib Al Hassan (35) and Nitish Kumar (20) forged the innings' most substantial partnership, adding 45 runs in 31 deliveries during the middle overs before being dismissed by Abrar Ahmed and Brody Couch in successive overs.David Miller (24) and Andre Russell (40*) put together a 34-run stand, but Miller was removed by Haris Rauf in the 17th over, just as the Knight Riders looked to accelerate. Russel's unbeaten 25-ball cameo, which included three sixes and two fours, concluded with 15 runs off Haris Rauf in the final over.Currently, the San Francisco Unicorns top the chart, having played and won one match, earning them 2 points with the highest Net Run Rate of +2.576.MI New York, in second place, has played two matches, winning one and losing one, also earning 2 points but with a Net Run Rate of +1.472.Washington Freedom, in third, has played and won one match, gaining 2 points and a Net Run Rate of +0.522.The Los Angeles Knight Riders, placed fourth, have played two matches, winning one and losing one, with a Net Run Rate of -0.768, also earning 2 points.Texas Super Kings, in fifth place, have played and lost one match, earning no points with a Net Run Rate of -0.600.Lastly, Seattle Orcans, also without any points, are in last place, having played and lost one match, with a Net Run Rate of -2.344.","The San Francisco Unicorns secured a commanding win against the LA Knight Riders in the fourth match of the 2024 Major League Cricket.

The first game of the series between England and the West Indies at Lord's, commencing on Wednesday, will mark his retirement from international cricket.Anderson's remarkable career has spanned over two decades, during which he has amassed an impressive tally of 700 Test wickets .His achievement is unparalleled among fast bowlers, with no other seamer having taken more wickets in the format. In terms of Test appearances, only the legendary Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar has played more matches than Anderson's 188.""Playing my 188th Test at just short of 42 years old, makes me the most proud and I'm still pushing myself to be the best I possibly can,"" AFP quoted Anderson as saying in a news conference at Lord's.""Even though I've got one game left, I've still tried to train as hard as I can.""The England cricket team , with their sights set on the upcoming Ashes series against Australia in 2025/26, has made a significant decision regarding the future of their veteran bowler.

""But I knew it had to end at some point, whether it's now or in a year or two.""The fact it's now is something I've got to deal with and accept.

I feel pretty happy with where things are now and excited for the week.""Anderson remains uncertain about his future in first-class cricket beyond this week's Test match. While he ponders his decision, the 40-year-old has not ruled out the possibility of continuing to represent his county side, Lancashire.""I've loved being out on the field for Lancashire, always have,"" said Anderson, who recently took an impressive 7-35 for the county.""I've not played a lot for them over the last 20 years, but always tried to give my all.""As cricket fans around the world eagerly await Anderson's decision, his impact on the sport remains undeniable.

NEW DELHI: Temba Bavuma is set to make his international cricket comeback after a hiatus that lasted the entire year. He will lead the South African team in a two-Test series against the West Indies, scheduled to take place in the upcoming month.Bavuma's prolonged absence from the South African squad highlights the current state of the cricketing world, as pointed out by coach Shukri Conrad.The coach emphasizes that the modern cricket landscape is predominantly focused on white-ball formats, which has had an impact on Bavuma's participation in the national team.""It is what it is and we just have to make it work,"" Conrad said, as quoted by AFP, at a press conference announcing a 16-man squad for the tour.Conrad will face a challenge in the upcoming pre-tour camp in Durban, as only half of his 16-man squad will be present due to their commitments in white-ball cricket and the English county season.Bavuma sustained an injury during the first Test match against India in December last year, forcing him to sit out the second Test. The Proteas suffered a humiliating defeat within one-and-a-half days on a subpar pitch in his absence.Subsequently, Bavuma was also unavailable for the two-Test series in New Zealand. South Africa sent a depleted squad, which resulted in losses in both matches, as the contracted players were obligated to participate in the SA20, a domestic franchise tournament.Bavuma did not participate in the T20 World Cup, where South Africa finished as runners-up.The majority of South Africa's T20 players are currently engaged in the Major League Cricket tournament in the United States, which concludes on July 28. The selected players for the West Indies tour will travel straight to the Caribbean, allowing them to participate in a warm-up match before the opening Test.Despite the circumstances, Conrad opted to maintain an optimistic outlook on the situation.""We've got the luxury of a warm-up game, so we've got 10 days in Trinidad before the first Test match,"" he said.""I mentioned to Temba that it's the first time as a Test unit that we're going to spend some extended time together.""My first series was against the West Indies (in February and March 2023) when we got together three days before the first game and we got together two days before the India series because there were Monday matches going on.""You just have to roll with the punches. It is the modern day world. Players can easily move from T20 and Test match cricket.""I'm very comfortable that guys will be in America. They'll take a short flight across and then we'll have a week's preparation before the first Test.""Matthew Breetzke , a 25-year-old batsman with experience in six T20 internationals and currently playing for Northamptonshire, an English county, has been selected as the sole uncapped player in the squad for the Tests in Trinidad and Guyana.The West Indies tour marks the beginning of a busy period for the Proteas, who have only played four Tests in the past year.

NEW DELHI: India are aiming to level the three-match women's T20 series against South Africa as they enter the final game on Tuesday, with inclement weather posing a significant threat to their ambitions. After the second match was washed out, leaving India trailing 0-1, the team is not only focused on the game but also hoping that rain does not become a decisive factor.In the first match of the series, India fell short by 12 runs against South Africa.The second game saw persistent drizzle halt the play midway, compounding India's troubles. With rain forecasts showing a 30 to 40 percent chance of precipitation on Tuesday, the Indian team remains anxious about the weather's impact.Indian bowlers have struggled in the series so far, with South Africa posting 189 for 9 and 177 for 6 in the two games. Pooja Vastrakar has been the standout performer for India, picking up two wickets in each game. Spinner Deepti Sharma has also shown some promise, but the rest of the bowling unit has failed to impress.Renuka Singh, who conceded too many runs in the first game, was replaced by Sajeevan Sajana in the second match, but Sajana did not make much impact either.Shreyanka Patil and Radha Yadav each managed to take a wicket in the second game but continued to be expensive.India's captain Harmanpreet Kaur, emphasizing the importance of a tighter bowling effort, has expressed her expectations clearly for the bowlers to improve their performance with the series on the line.On the batting side, India have had a decent run. Key players like Jemimah Rodrigues (53 not out), Smriti Mandhana(46), Harmanpreet (35), Shafali Verma (18), and Dayalan Hemalatha (14) have all contributed. Uma Chetry, who debuted in the T20I format on Sunday, is likely to get another chance to showcase her abilities with the bat.South Africa have displayed robust batting performances, led primarily by Tazmin Brits, who has scored consecutive half-centuries. Additionally, significant contributions have come from skipper Laura Wolvaardt, Marizanne Kapp, and Anneke Bosch.The sole concern for South Africa has been Chloe Tryon, who managed identical 12 runs in both games.With the upcoming T20 World Cup in Bangladesh, Tryon will be keen to prove her critics wrong and find her form.India look forward to an all-around improved performance in the final game while paying close attention to weather updates that could influence the outcome significantly.Harmanpreet Kaur(c), Smriti Mandhana(vc), Uma Chetry(wk), Richa Ghosh(wk), Dayalan Hemalatha, Jemimah Rodrigues, Shafali Verma, Amanjot Kaur, Shreyanka Patil, Sajeevan Sajana, Deepti Sharma, Asha Sobhana, Arundhati Reddy, Renuka Singh, Shabnam Shakil, Pooja Vastrakar and Radha Yadav.Laura Wolvaardt(c), Tazmin Brits, Mieke de Ridder(wk), Sinalo Jafta(wk), Anneke Bosch, Nadine de Klerk, Annerie Dercksen, Marizanne Kapp, Sune Luus, Chloe Tryon, Ayabonga Khaka, Masabata Klaas, Eliz-Mari Marx, Nonkululeko Mlaba and Tumi Sekhukhune.","India are aiming to level the three-match women's T20 series against South Africa.

NEW DELHI: Uruguay advanced to the Copa America semi-finals after a hard-fought 0-0 draw against Brazil at the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, ultimately prevailing 4-2 in a penalty shootout.The match was marked by a red card for Uruguay's Nahitan Nandez in the second half, leaving his team with 10 men.Brazil, without the suspended Vinicius Jr, found it challenging to create chances despite their numerical advantage.In the penalty shootout, Uruguay gained the advantage when Sergio Rochet saved Eder Militao's spot kick and Douglas Luiz hit the post.Although Alisson Becker kept Brazil's hopes alive by denying Jose Maria Gimenez and Gabriel Martinelli scored his penalty, Manuel Ugarte sealed the victory for Uruguay with the decisive kick. Uruguay now face Colombia in the semi-finals as they continue their pursuit of a record-extending 16th Copa America title.""It was a very tense match, against a very tough opponent, suffering in the last minutes a man down. But we showed character despite our youth,"" Rochet said.""To finish with penalties and winning, I was able to save one... The truth is that it is a tremendous happiness that this group deserves, the country deserves it. We are very excited, so we are going for more.""The match between Brazil and Uruguay was a physical battle, with both teams committing a total of 41 fouls. Players from both sides engaged in intense challenges throughout the game.Uruguay's high-pressing strategy left little room for Brazil's young forward Endrick to operate, as he found himself on the receiving end of some tough tackles. In one instance, Ronald Araujo pushed Endrick to the ground, prompting an angry reaction from Brazil's captain Raphinha, who shoved Araujo in retaliation. The referee intervened, having a firm conversation with both players without issuing any cards.Araujo's match was cut short when he had to be substituted due to an injury just after the 30-minute mark. The game suddenly came to life moments later when Darwin Nunez missed a close-range header. Brazil quickly launched a counter-attack, but Raphinha's shot was denied by goalkeeper Rochet in what was Brazil's best chance of the first half.Uruguay struggled to penetrate Brazil's defense, prompting coach Marcelo Bielsa to make three substitutions by the 67th minute. However, his strategy was disrupted when Nandez was sent off after a VAR review for a reckless tackle on Rodrygo.Despite having a numerical advantage, Brazil failed to score against Uruguay's compact defense, as the Uruguayans opted to sit back and take their chances in the penalty shootout, knowing that there is no extra-time in the Copa America except for the final.This marks Brazil's second consecutive quarter-final exit via penalties in a major tournament, following their defeat to Croatia in the 2022 World Cup.""We want to put Brazil at the top, we will continue working and preparing for the World Cup (qualifiers),"" Endrick said.""We know that this is a difficult moment, but we hope to have the support of all Brazilians.""","Uruguay advance to the Copa America semi-finals after beating Brazil 4-2 in a penalty shootout.

They will face the Netherlands, who overcame Turkey in the other quarter-final match.The game in Duesseldorf was largely uneventful for the first 75 minutes until Breel Embolo gave Switzerland the lead by sliding in at the back post to convert Dan Ndoye 's deflected cross.However, England responded quickly, with Bukayo Saka scoring a fine goal from wide on the right, finding the far corner of the net to level the score just five minutes later.Despite a close call from substitute Xherdan Shaqiri, who hit the woodwork directly from a corner late in extra time, the match remained tied and proceeded to a penalty shootout.England converted all of their penalties, while Switzerland's Manuel Akanji was the only player to miss, with his attempt saved by Jordan Pickford.Cole Palmer, Jude Bellingham, Saka, Ivan Toney, and Trent Alexander-Arnold all scored their penalties to send England through to the semi-finals, helping to ease the pain of their shootout loss to Italy in the Euro 2020 final.""We are not going to stop fighting, we are in another semi-final and we'll see where we can get to,"" said Southgate, who marked the victory in his 100th game in charge with a dance in front of the England fans.""Every now and then you think surely there has to be some enjoyment in this job.

The Dutch side secured their spot in the last four after overcoming a one-goal deficit to defeat Turkey 2-1 in Berlin during Saturday's other quarter-final match.Turkey took the lead in the first half when Samet Akaydin, who was filling in for the suspended Merih Demiral, headed in from Arda Guler's cross in the 35th minute.Demiral, Turkey's two-goal hero in their last-16 victory against Austria, was banned for this game due to making a controversial salute, which led to a diplomatic dispute between Turkey and Germany in the lead-up to the match at Berlin's Olympiastadion.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended the game, along with tens of thousands of supporters who greeted every prolonged Dutch possession with a chorus of whistles.Despite the hostile atmosphere, the Netherlands maintained their composure and found an equalizer 20 minutes from the end when Stefan de Vrij scored with a powerful header from Memphis Depay's cross.The Dutch then secured the victory six minutes later when Mert Muldur inadvertently turned a low Denzel Dumfries cross into his own net while under pressure from Cody Gakpo.This win was sufficient for the Netherlands, who last won the Euros in West Germany in 1988, to progress to their first semi-final at the tournament since 2004.""Tonight we had to dig very deep and I am proud of these guys,"" captain Virgil van Dijk told broadcaster NOS.""We want to fulfil our dream and we are one step closer.""Spain and France are set to face off in an exciting semi-final match in Munich on Tuesday.

By then, Ronaldo will be 41 years old, raising questions about his ability to continue playing at the highest level, where he holds the men's record for international goals (130) and appearances (212).But he has now gone eight consecutive games without scoring in major tournaments. This includes all five of Portugal's matches atEuro 2024 and their final three games at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Although he successfully converted his penalty in the shootout against France, it wasn't enough to secure victory.“I won't say it publicly,"" Pepe replied when asked by TV station Canal 11 what Ronaldo said to him. ""But we feel it a lot. Contrary to what many people think, we feel it a lot. We feel the frustration of not winning a game, of being eliminated in such a big competition as the European Championship, knowing that we had a lot of quality to go through. That's the pain we feel.”Cristiano Ronaldo concludes his European Championship journey with an unparalleled 14 goals, remaining the tournament's all-time leading scorer, which is five goals more than Michel Platini, as mentioned in an AP report.Ronaldo's longevity and consistency are unmatched, as he stands alone as the sole player to participate in six European Championship tournaments.","Portugal lost to France on penalties in the quarterfinals of the European Championship.

The game ended 0-0 after 120 minutes, with France prevailing 5-3 in the shoot-out. This match is likely to be remembered as Cristiano Ronaldo 's final appearance in the tournament.France converted all their penalties, setting up a semi-final clash with Spain.Portugal's Joao Felix was the only player to miss, hitting the post with his team's third attempt.The shoot-out triumph was a welcome change for France, who had previously suffered penalty heartbreaks in major tournaments. They lost the 2022 World Cup final to Argentina and were eliminated from the last Euros by Switzerland in the round of 16, both via penalties. Additionally, they were defeated by Italy in the 2006 World Cup final, which was also held in Germany.Kylian Mbappe, who had missed the decisive penalty against Switzerland, was substituted by Bradley Barcola during extra time and did not participate in the shoot-out.

Even if we are not doing everything perfectly we don't give up,"" said France coach Didier Deschamps.""Once again we are in the semi-finals. I will savour this a little even if we have another game coming up.""Mbappe struggled to find his rhythm throughout the match, as he continues to adapt to playing with a protective mask covering his recently fractured nose, an injury sustained during France's initial encounter against Austria.Despite the setback, the young forward will have another opportunity to showcase his talents in the upcoming semi-final. On the other hand, Ronaldo, at the age of 39, seems to have made his final appearance in the European Championship.This tournament marked Ronaldo's sixth European Championship, but he was unable to contribute to his record-breaking tally of 14 goals in the competition, having failed to find the back of the net in all five of Portugal's matches in Germany.Although Ronaldo successfully converted his penalty, which was Portugal's first, Roberto Martinez's squad has been eliminated after failing to score in over six hours of play. They advanced to the quarter-finals by defeating Slovenia on penalties following a goalless draw in the round of 16, but this time, they fell short in what turned out to be a lackluster match in Hamburg.""In the same way that it was maybe cruel for Slovenia in the last 16, today it was cruel for us. That's football ,"" Bernardo Silva told CNN.France and Portugal, both underperforming in the tournament, faced off in a match that lacked intensity but had moments of excitement in the second half.Portugal started to threaten with midfield runners getting into the box, as Bruno Fernandes and Vitinha tested Mike Maignan, who was determined to maintain his clean sheet in open play. Ronaldo nearly scored from close range, but Maignan reacted quickly to deny him.France countered with Kolo Muani and Kounde combining, but Ruben Dias made a crucial interception.Deschamps brought on Dembele, who immediately set up a golden opportunity for Camavinga, which the midfielder missed. The game drifted towards extra time, where Ronaldo missed a good chance from Francisco Conceicao's cutback.Mbappe, France's captain, watched the end of extra time from the bench as Maignan denied Nuno Mendes at the very end of 120 minutes, leading to a penalty shoot-out.The shoot-out took place at the Portugal end of the Volksparkstadion, with Maignan not making any saves but not needing to. Despite Diogo Costa's heroics in the previous round, saving three Slovenia penalties, he could not stop any this time.","France beat Portugal 5-3 on penalties in Euro 2024 quarter-final match.

NEW DELHI: Taylor Fritz staged a remarkable comeback to defeat fourth seed Alexander Zverev 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 6-3 and reach the Wimbledon quarter-finals. The German's flawless serving record at this year's tournament was shattered by the American's resilient performance.Initially, Zverev showed no signs of being hampered by the knee injury he sustained in the previous round.His serve remained untouchable, as he extended his streak of consecutive holds to 56 across four matches, and he appeared poised to secure his first-ever last-eight berth at the grasscourt major.However, at 4-4 in the third set, a surprising double fault from Zverev handed Fritz a crucial break. From that moment, the American's game soared to new heights. He relentlessly pursued every shot the German fired at him and produced some stunning diving winners in the decisive set, leaving Zverev visibly stunned.Facing two break points at 2-1 down in the fifth set, Zverev managed to stay in the game by concluding a grueling yet mesmerizing 21-shot rally with a blistering forehand winner. Despite his valiant efforts, the German ultimately succumbed to Fritz's determined play, ending his Wimbledon campaign in a hard-fought five-set battle.Fritz's determination was evident as he threw himself across the court, his 6-foot-4 frame sprawling in a valiant effort to return Zverev's forehand.Though he missed that particular shot, Fritz quickly regrouped and secured the break in the very next point, establishing a commanding 3-1 lead. From that moment, Zverev's chances of a comeback diminished rapidly.As Fritz struck a decisive backhand winner into an unguarded part of the court, he released his racket and raised his arms, savoring the moment of victory. On the other side of the net, Zverev was left to contemplate another frustrating departure from the Wimbledon tournament.""It was amazing to do that on Centre Court when you are two sets down in front of this crowd. It's a dream,"" Fritz told the crowd after defeating a top five player at a Grand Slam for the first time in his career.""I was just thinking it sucked to be playing this well and to lose in three straights. Even though I lost the first two sets, I really believed I was playing good tennis . I felt it was just a couple of point here and there and that I could take it one step at a time and turn it around.""The American 13th seed will next face Italian Lorenzo Musetti.","Taylor Fritz beats fourth seed Alexander Zverev 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3) Fritz will next face Italian Lorenzo Musetti in the quarter-finals.
