From Minerals Gift To Diplomatic Snub: Pakistan Misses Out On Key US Meet While India Takes Seat

The online reckoning

Why this cut so deep

PM Modi and Trump

The received wisdom in Washington circles has been that Pakistan has ‘played’ Donald Trump better than its Indian counterpart. This has included praising Donald Trump to high heavens at every turn, nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize with every breath, offering him (snake?) oil, and in general agreeing to anything including joining the Board of Peace.Perhaps, Pakistan felt it had returned to its older role of indispensable intermediary as New Delhi remained the insouciant child who refused to bow to Trump’s diktats. Overnight, the illusion shattered as Trump announced the US had reached a trade agreement with India lowering tariffs on India’s exports to 18%. While most of the details about the deal are still being worked out, that didn’t stop a full-blown meltdown on Pakistani (or South Asian) Twitter.One viral tweet summed up the mood: “Mover, shaker, and beggars.”That line became a shorthand for something deeper than trade arithmetic. The reaction in Pakistan was not about supply chains or tariff schedules. It was about hierarchy.The first wave of reactions was disbelief. Then came sarcasm. Then came something closer to anger, much of it directed inward. Pakistani social media users began listing, almost ritualistically, the many ways Islamabad had publicly courted Trump.The Nobel Peace Prize nomination resurfaced again and again, often framed as a punchline. So did Pakistan’s enthusiastic endorsement of Trump’s various peace initiatives and grand visions.A widely circulated post laid it out bluntly: Pakistan did everything to please Trump, including nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize, joining his “Board of Peace”, and offering cooperation on minerals. Yet India, which spent months resisting Trump’s pressure, ended up with a lower tariff rate. To make matters worse, users pointed out, India had also just secured major trade concessions with the European Union.The tone shifted quickly from disbelief to gallows humour. One viral image showed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Army Chief Asim Munir holding up an AI-styled magazine cover featuring Modi and Trump, both leaders pointing at the image as if presenting evidence of a reality they could not alter. The accompanying Urdu caption roughly translated to: “Asim Munir is stuck between them… the world has moved on.”Across Facebook and Instagram, memes treated the 18% versus 19% tariff gap like a scoreboard. Comment threads were filled with variations of the same lament: how did bending over backwards still lead to being sidelined? Why did obedience not translate into leverage?Even YouTube reaction videos, often noisy and incoherent, showed an unusual convergence. Commenters questioned the entire premise of Pakistan’s Trump strategy. If this was the payoff for flattery, many asked, what exactly had been achieved?For months, Pakistan’s elite discourse had convinced itself that India-US relations were deteriorating while Pakistan-US ties were stabilising. Trump’s public irritation with India was misread as strategic rupture. Pakistan’s warmth was read as influence. Proximity was mistaken for power.The trade deal punctured that narrative decisively. What Pakistan’s discourse missed was that India’s apparent indifference was not neglect. It was posture.New Delhi did not merely refuse to flatter Trump; it actively declined to participate in his theatre. Reporting through last year showed that as tariff tensions escalated, India chose distance over desperation. At the height of the standoff, international media reported that Prime Minister Narendra Modi declined to take multiple phone calls from Trump, an almost unheard-of move in the choreography of great-power diplomacy. Silence, in this case, was not accidental. It was communicative.That frostiness surfaced more clearly in what would become the last direct exchange between the two leaders. According to reporting by The New York Times, a June phone call turned sour when Trump claimed credit for de-escalating tensions between India and Pakistan and floated the familiar Nobel Peace Prize rhetoric. New Delhi pushed back firmly, insisting that India and Pakistan had managed matters bilaterally, without US mediation. After that call, the two leaders did not speak again for months.That, in hindsight, is what makes the trade deal so destabilising for Pakistan’s narrative. India did not win by courting Trump better. It won by not courting him at all.","Pakistan's elite discourse had convinced itself that India-US relations were deteriorating while Pakistan-US ties were stabilising.

NEW DELHI: Union minister and former Congress MP Ravneet Bittu and Rahul Gandhi got into a bitter exchange Wednesday, when the LoP mocked him as a “traitor” and a surprised Bittu retorted with a “desh ke dushman” barb.The exchange — which took place at the main entrance of the Parliament building, where Rahul was standing in solidarity with the eight MPs who are on protest since being suspended from the Lok Sabha a day earlier — was caught on video and promptly went viral. It was also circulated by Congress.While walking towards Parliament for morning proceedings, Bittu, grandson of former Punjab CM Beant Singh, who was killed by Khalistani terrorists, mocked the protesters “as sitting as if they had won a war”, which appeared to have annoyed Rahul and his colleagues.As he approached to walk past, Rahul said, “The thing is, here is a traitor walking right by. Take a look at the face. How he looks.” Bittu wagged his finger and retorted, “desh ke dushman (enemy of the country)”. Rahul then extended his hand towards Bittu and said, “Hello brother, my traitor friend”, even adding, “Don’t worry, you will come back (to Congress)”. Bittu, however, did not reciprocate with a handshake. As he walked past, Congress MPs jeered, “surrender, surrender”.The altercation had a fallout outside Parliament, with BJP protesting against Rahul’s “traitor” jibe. BJP fielded several Sikh faces, including Union minister Hardeep Puri, Delhi minister Manjinder Sirsa and MLA Arvinder Lovely, to hit out at Rahul. Puri claimed that “traitor” is used for those who betray their country, and said Rahul’s comment was all the more insulting for Sikhs as Ravneet is the grandson of former Punjab CM Beant Singh, who was assassinated by Khalistani terrorists and is lauded for his role in restoring normalcy in Punjab.“Use of such language for a member of such a family is not only shameful but an insult to the entire Sikh community. His comment is a slur on every Sikh. It is an insult to the contributions made by Sikhs in every sphere,” Puri alleged.Rahul and Bittu had a close association before the Punjab neta crossed over to BJP ahead of the 2024 LS elections. He contested from Ludhiana on a BJP ticket but lost to Amarinder Raja Warring.In fact, Punjab Congress netas posted a video in which Bittu says Rahul encouraged him to start tying a turban. In the viral clip, Bittu says, “If I am standing here in a turban, it’s because of Rahul Gandhi, who told me I should wear a turban.”",Former Congress MP Ravneet Bittu and Rahul Gandhi got into a bitter exchange Wednesday.

Luka Doncic opens up on being LeBron James’ teammate in Los Angeles Lakers

Luka Dončić on the Lakers as Contenders, the Dallas Trade & Are the Nuggets Better Than the Thunder?

Did LeBron James get Luka Doncic nervous in the beginning?

Luka Doncic got traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in a stunning mid-season move by the Dallas Mavericks. While fans were shocked, many were excited to see the Slovenian athlete pair up with the NBA legend LeBron James . The dream came true as both athletes joined hands in leading the Lakers to their recent victories. In the latest episode of the Cousins with Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady podcast, Luka actually candidly revealed his experience playing with the legend.Luka expressed his gratefulness for being a part of the iconic LeBron James’ career. It has been rumored that LeBron will be retiring soon. Hence, it could not have been a better time to witness the final journey of the athlete as a teammate. Luka even revealed his greatest inspiration for joining the league and it was none other than LeBron James himself.In the latest episode of the Cousins with Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady podcast, Luka Doncic was asked a question that many would want to know. The athlete was asked what life has been like since he got to play with the NBA legend LeBron James. Luka’s response was quite heartwarming. The Slovenian athlete stated, “Honestly, just being part of his journey, you know, it has been amazing.” He further revealed the real motivation behind Luka entering the league.“I came into the league, like, watching him play.”It was a surreal moment for Luka when he first played against LeBron. He added, “My first game against him was like a dream come true. So just being his teammate, it’s insane.” Vince Carter continued the conversation by posing another question to him. When Luka got traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, many believed that both Luka and LeBron’s individual basketball IQ would create conflicts. However, the coordination between them looks effortless. Carter asked Luka how the players pulled that off. Luka instantly replied, “I think it's mostly understanding. Obviously, we talk a little bit. But I just feel like when he was injured in the beginning, after he came back, in the first couple of games, it wasn’t that good.” He continued, “But now, since we played a long time together, it’s getting better and better.”During the podcast, in the same segment, Vince Carter pointed out something that LeBron James did. This act of LeBron James might have made Luka Doncic nervous and uncomfortable. It was in the huddle during Luka’s first game with the Los Angeles Lakers. Carter exclusively mentioned that LeBron asked the Slovenian athlete to be who he is. Luka did agree to the instance and accepted the fact that he was nervous for his first ever game with the Lakers.",Luka Doncic got traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in a stunning mid-season move by the Dallas Mavericks.

Poll Do you believe Ishan Kishan has secured his position in the starting XI for the World Cup? Yes, without a doubt No, it's still uncertain Depends on his next performances

At the post-match presentation during India’s warm-up game against South Africa, Ishan Kishan admitted that he knew he was going to open a day before the match. And boy, did he make the most of the opportunity, ending the Ishan Kishan vs Sanju Samson debate, at least for a while now.Ishan Kishan’s belligerent 20-ball 53 lit up the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai and sealed the opening spot for India’s tournament opener against the USA at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Saturday.If the T20I series against New Zealand was an opportunity to prove that he still belonged, the fixture against South Africa was a stern message that he is warmed up for the marquee event. In front of over 40,000 spectators, Ishan was like a kid who knew his way around a candy shop as he picked his spots as effortlessly as drawing lollipops from the shelves. Anrich Nortje was a portrait of disbelief when he was smashed for four sixes in an over. The faster he bowled, the quicker they sailed into the stands as South Africa looked like a hapless bunch when the assault was on. The pick-ups over fine leg were clean and mean, the variations were read to perfection, and it was fitting that his entertaining innings ended the way it started—with an authoritative six.Ishan always had that extra spunk in his batting, but there has been tremendous improvement in his range, and the hard yards in the domestic circuit have hardened him for the international grind.He has been a character who was never overawed by the occasion, but the weight of runs has allowed him to take his game a few notches higher than where it was when he last played at this level. There is no fear, no insecurity, and a lot of clarity. The runs did come at No.3 in the New Zealand T20Is, but Ishan was really “excited” to return to the opening position in the Blues.“I did find out a day prior to this game. Was very much excited for this opportunity. I wanted to open the innings. Enjoyed batting at 3 as well. With the World Cup coming up, even if I was to bat at any number, I was looking to do my best,” he said after India’s 30-run win over South Africa.Clarity of thought has remained the keyword in how Ishan has gone about his business since returning to the setup, and it is validated by the shot selection in the last few outings. Seeing the ball and reading the bowler has been the mantra, and the emphasis has been on “staying in the present” rather than “putting too much thought or effort”.“I think it’s about staying in the present, watching the ball, and playing the shots that are required at that point in time. I’m not putting too much thought or effort into it. I’m just reacting, watching the ball, and playing accordingly, and that seems to be working well for me. Some days you feel really good, some days you don’t.“On this particular day, I also have to give credit to the pitch; it was tremendous to bat on, even in the second innings. With the World Cup so close, it’s important to be in the mindset that if the ball is there, even if there’s a fielder, you back yourself and go for it,” he added.When he was called back to the dugout after facing 20 balls, which were laced with seven sixes and two fours, captain Suryakumar Yadav was up on his feet applauding the knock. Hardik Pandya came out of the change room to tap his former Mumbai Indians teammate’s head in appreciation, and the team management would have taken a sigh of relief at having found the missing piece to their batting puzzle.Sanju Samson’s loss of form came at a very poor time as far as the wicketkeeper-batter is concerned, but Ishan’s giant strides to dominance augured well for the entire unit heading into a multi-nation tournament. Surya had tried to keep everyone guessing when he said the call on Ishan and Sanju would be revealed on February 7, but he wasn’t left with an option other than to take the “definitely Ishan and Abhishek (to open)” route at the toss.Such was Ishan’s dominance that even Abhishek was reduced to a spectator from the other end as the wicketkeeper-batter farmed most of the strike and manufactured shots at will. The two would exchange a smirky smile every time Ishan went big and the scoreboard raced to 80/0 at lightning speed. For a change, Abhishek wasn’t the marauder in the first six as he could only manage 23 off the 14 deliveries he faced.This is what good form, coupled with the right amount of backing, can do. It can reduce one of the most destructive batters in the format to the position of a bystander. A batter used to hitting at least a couple of boundaries in his first few balls found his first hit to the ropes only off the eighth delivery he faced. Two more came off the next two, but it was clear by the end of the fourth over that it was Ishan who was dominating the powerplay game on Wednesday.There has been a lot of debate over Ishan vs Sanju Samson for the spot, but it is now set to be put to bed. You surely can’t bench an in-form batter like Ishan, and Sanju’s excess baggage of recent failures will weigh the team down in their title defence at home. There is scope for extended runs, like an out-of-form Surya got in bilaterals, but multi-nation tournaments are a different sauce. One bad game, one poor start can suck momentum out of the campaign, and there is very little scope for recovery in a format which, like India’s batting, vrooms in the fast lane.Sanju tried, and so did the management by giving him an extended run, but it looks like the right-hander’s wait to play his World Cup game for the country is going to get even longer.At the moment, it’s Ishan’s world, and we all are living in it.Meanwhile, the Indian batters too have embraced life in the fast lane, and Wednesday evening was another exhibition of the template they have stuck to in the last few months in the format. Even in tight corners, there is no intention of slowing down, and Suryakumar Yadav & Co. will instil a lot of fear in the oppositions they are scheduled to face in the upcoming T20 World Cup.There is a belligerent Abhishek Sharma, a back-to-form Suryakumar Yadav, consistent Tilak Varma, a dangerous lower middle order featuring Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Rinku Singh, Axar Patel, and a fresh addition to this dangerous bunch is pocket dynamo Ishan Kishan.Former India captain MS Dhoni had already warned the other teams, praising Team India’s “vast experience” in the shortest format of the game.“It is one of the most dangerous teams. But what all is needed in a good team? Everything. They have the experience, especially when it comes to this format. The experience is vast,” Dhoni had said on cricket commentator Jatin Sapru’s official YouTube channel.Fasten your seatbelts as Surya and his boys are on the loose, and the way they are batting is the culmination of the shifting tectonic plates in T20 cricket.",Ishan Kishan scored 53 runs in India’s warm-up game against South Africa.

Are India favourites to win 2026 T20 World Cup? | Greenstone Lobo makes a HUGE PREDICTION

NEW DELHI: Team India suffered a fresh injury concern just days before the T20 World Cup, scheduled to start on Saturday (February 7), after young pacer Harshit Rana limped off the field during their warm-up match against South Africa at the Dr DY Patil Sports Academy in Navi Mumbai on Wednesday evening.With uncertainty already surrounding spin-bowling all-rounder Washington Sundar’s fitness, Rana’s exit added to the defending champions’ worries ahead of the global event. The 24-year-old Delhi pacer bowled just one over, conceding 16 runs, before walking off in visible discomfort and taking no further part in the contest.Rana appeared troubled during his over, pulling out of his delivery stride on two occasions. Moments later, he was seen clutching his knee and hobbling off the field, sparking concern among teammates and the support staff. An official update from the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is still awaited, leaving fans and team management anxious about the severity of the issue.The latest scare comes as India continue to monitor Washington Sundar, who sustained an injury during the first ODI against New Zealand and is yet to join the World Cup camp. With the tournament fast approaching, the team will hope for positive news on both players’ fitness.There was some relief, however, as Tilak Varma marked his return from injury with an impressive all-round display. The left-hander smashed 45 off just 19 balls, hitting three sixes and three fours before being bowled by Marco Jansen, and also bowled an economical over that went for nine runs.Despite the injury setback, India secured a convincing 30-run win in their only warm-up fixture. In-form Ishan Kishan continued his blistering run, hammering a 20-ball 53 packed with seven sixes and two fours as India piled up 241 for five on a batting-friendly surface. The bowlers then combined well, using as many as nine options — including Abhishek Sharma’s two wickets — to restrict South Africa to 210 for seven.","Harshit Rana limped off the field during India's warm-up match against South Africa.

Dear Gautam Gambhir and Suryakumar Yadav, don't let Ishan Kishan down

Poll Should Ishan Kishan open the innings for India in the T20 World Cup? Yes, he should No, he should bat lower down Depends on the match situation

NEW DELHI: In-form Ishan Kishan sent a strong message ahead of the T20 World Cup, smashing a breathtaking half-century and openly declaring his desire to open the innings for India as the defending champions defeated South Africa by 30 runs in their only warm-up match at the DY Patil Stadium in Mumbai on Wednesday.Kishan’s explosive 20-ball 53 — studded with seven towering sixes and two fours — powered India to a daunting 241 for five on a batting-friendly surface. The left-hander’s aggressive intent at the top, alongside Abhishek Sharma, provided the early momentum that set the tone for the match and potentially reshaped India’s batting order heading into the global tournament.After the game, Kishan did not shy away from addressing the opening debate, admitting his excitement about the role. “I was really excited for Wednesday. I wanted to open the innings,” he said, underlining his growing confidence after a run of strong performances leading into the World Cup.While he made his intentions clear, Kishan stressed that team balance remains his priority. “Batting at number three, I enjoyed that situation, but with the World Cup coming up, no matter what position I bat in, my focus is always on doing my best for the team.I think it’s about staying in the present, watching the ball and playing the shots that are required at that point in time. I’m not putting too much thought or effort into it,” he explained.His approach reflected in the fearless way he batted, launching into South Africa’s attack from the outset. “I’m just reacting, watching the ball, and playing accordingly, and that seems to be working well for me. Some days you feel really good, some days you don’t. On this particular day, I also have to give credit to the pitch, it was tremendous to bat on, even in the second innings. I trusted the wicket and the bounce,” Kishan added.India captain Suryakumar Yadav had already hinted at a new direction at the toss, confirming Kishan and Abhishek as the opening pair — a move that appeared to push Sanju Samson further down the pecking order. “Definitely Ishan and Abhishek,” Suryakumar said, signalling the team management’s thinking as India experimented ahead of the marquee event at home.Kishan’s mindset, he revealed, has been shaped by the urgency of a World Cup year. “With the World Cup so close, it’s important to be in the mindset that if the ball is there, even if there’s a fielder, you back yourself and go for it,” he said, reflecting the attacking philosophy India want from their top order.Beyond his own performance, Kishan also highlighted the importance of Tilak Varma’s return from injury, describing him as a key multi-dimensional asset. “He’s very important for us. He’s not just a batsman anymore, he gives us a few overs, especially when two left-handers are batting. He’s a very good fielder, and the way he’s batting these days, you need someone at number three who can rotate the strike and keep things moving,” he said.India’s bowlers, meanwhile, used nine different options to restrict South Africa to 210 for seven, with Abhishek Sharma contributing two wickets. Kishan felt the bowling unit delivered under challenging conditions but admitted improvements were still needed. “There’s always room for improvement. We’ll talk about areas we can bowl to batters and how we can plan better. But on this wicket, I think we did a pretty good job… Overall, it was a solid bowling effort, though we’ll sit down and discuss how we can improve further,” he said.",Ishan Kishan scores 53 as India beat South Africa by 30 runs in warm-up match.

NEW DELHI: India got a new T20 opening pair on Wednesday as Ishan Kishan and Abhishek Sharma walked out to open the innings at the Dr DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai. The Men-in-Blue were playing South Africa in their only warm-up match ahead of the T20 World Cup 2026. India won the toss, and captain Suryakumar Yadav chose to bat first.At the toss, Suryakumar confirmed a change at the top of the batting order, indicating a possible setback for Sanju Samson’s World Cup plans. The Indian captain said that Ishan Kishan will open the innings alongside Abhishek Sharma, pushing Samson out of the opening role.""We are going to bat first. It is something we have been doing well. There might be some dew later in the evening, we want to test our bowlers in challenging conditions and defend the total, whatever we get,"" Suryakumar said at the toss.When asked about the opening combination and handling pressure at home, the India captain made the team’s plan clear. ""Definitely Ishan and Abhishek. [On dealing with pressure and expectations] See, I think when you are playing in India in front of your home ground, there are expectations. But at the same time so many people in the stadium cheering you on, I think it gives you an extra advantage,"" he added.Sanju Samson’s position has been under scrutiny for several months.Before the Asia Cup 2025, Samson and Abhishek Sharma opened the innings and delivered steady returns. However, the team management later brought Shubman Gill into the side, which pushed Samson into the middle order. That change affected Samson’s output, and calls grew to restore him as an opener.Gill’s lack of runs and slow scoring rate led the selectors to bring back Ishan Kishan after his strong Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy season. Samson then got another chance at the top but managed only 49 runs in five innings against New Zealand. During the same series, Kishan batted at No.3 and scored his maiden T20I century.With Tilak Varma returning to the squad, the management has now decided to move Kishan to the opening slot. That shift has left no clear place for Samson in the playing XI. The team’s thinking was hinted at earlier as well, when Kishan was asked to keep wickets in the fifth T20I.The warm-up match decision has raised questions about whether Samson’s chances of making the T20 World Cup XI are slipping, with the captain’s ""definitely Ishan"" comment underlining the current pecking order at the top.",India open with Ishan Kishan and Abhishek Sharma in warm-up match against South Africa.

Oba Femi’s estimated net worth and income sources

What Oba Femi’s WWE contract probably looks like

Oba Femi has been on a fast, stunning, and lucrative track from college athletics to TV with WWE. The powerhouse, who was born in Nigeria and goes by the real name Isaac Odugbesan, made his way to pro wrestling via WWE's Next In Line program and quickly took NXT by storm as its most destructive force. His brute strength, magnetic personality, and great ring work led him to championships and gave him a reputation as one of the company’s young stars.As with most of the WWE stars in developing roles, the details surrounding Femi’s pay are not public. WWE does not disclose contract figures, especially for talent less than a year into a deal. Still, wrestling insiders and analysts have come up with rough estimates, referencing standard developmental contracts and bonus structures, as well as other ways for FCW wrestlers to make money, such as merchandise sales, for example, and appearances at live events.Oba Femi is estimated to have a net worth between $200,000 and $500,000 as of now. It's still new territory for a guy who's spent most of his career in NXT, but is finally getting a little more exposure on the main roster, so those numbers are just average. His earnings through salary, performance bonuses, and promotional opportunities are tied to WWE programming.Femi likely had a run of type of a standard developmental contract money when he was in NXT.Sources in the wrestling world state that the majority of those in NXT earn a base salary between $50,000 and $100,000 per annum, depending on experience and where they are placed on the card. Performers also earn extra income through match bonuses, special event payouts, and merchandise sales. The more prominent and popular Femi has received on Raw, the more he is able to earn, with regular Raw appearances hopefully coming soon.The specific terms of Oba Femi's WWE deal have not been disclosed, but the arrangement is presumably similar to those of other athletes who have come into the company through the promotion's NIL route. These deals are typically developmental deals that contain a lot of training at the Performance Centre, working NXT television tapings, and setting up a character for long-term success.Those contracts usually consist of a baseline salary guarantee, plus bonuses for championships, big shows, and increased television exposure. When a performer transitions to the Raw or SmackDown roster full-time, their pay usually goes up significantly. Higher merchandise royalties, global tour payments, and sponsorships are also available to main roster stars and can add to their annual earnings.","Oba Femi has been on a fast, stunning, and lucrative track from college athletics to TV with WWE.

Ian Machado Garry is currently receiving the end of criticism from fans. after his recent remarks on Shavkat Rakhmonov. Rakhmonov's injury forced him out of the welterweight rankings. The Irishman chose to mock the unbeaten fighter. But with him taking shots at the Kazakh fighter, Garry once received similar treatment from a former UFC welterweight champion.The athlete rankings have undergone some significant changes following the end of UFC 325 last weekend. However, the changes that came in the welterweight division are not because of any fight results; it’s because of Shavkat Rakhmonov‘s removal from the list. Although many were surprised by his choice, Garry viewed it as a chance to troll Rakhmonov. But with that, an ex-champion’s clip of taking harsh shots at ‘The Future’ also emerged.As soon as Shavkat Rakhmonov got eliminated from the UFC welterweight rankings, Ian Garry took to social media to tease him. Garry wrote on X, “He (Shavkat) was eliminated at our title eliminator.” Although the Irishman was the one who lost against Rakhmonov at UFC 310, he has a different perspective.With his remarks, discussions are circulating on social media; fans reemerged with one of former UFC welterweight champion Leon Edwards’ remarks about Garry’s defeat to Rakhmonov.“Ian’s biggest achievement in this sport is losing to Shavkat, and that’s a fact,” said Edwards during a 2025 interview with Ariel Helwani. “I mean, that’s his greatest achievement that he can brag that he didn’t get finished. I mean, that doesn’t work for me and my plans; it doesn’t. If it comes, it comes; if it doesn’t, it doesn’t.”It appears that fans resurfaced Edwards' comment to emphasize how Garry can take pride in his match against Rakhmonov, despite being on the losing side. Although the reason may not be entirely accurate, it still has a resemblance to Garry's perspective on fights against the Kazakh fighter. Rakhmonov’s drop from the UFC rankings is due to his injuries, which have hindered his return to the octagon. ‘The Future’ has been active and has already fought two times after that.

Kevin Johnson’s past and the growing fear of a pattern

Kevin Johnson’s death is no longer being treated as just another tragic killing in Los Angeles. It is now part of a much bigger and far more troubling investigation. The former NFL defensive lineman was found dead on January 21 inside a homeless encampment in South Los Angeles. Investigators say he suffered blunt force trauma to the head and multiple stab wounds. That detail alone raised alarms. Now, police believe his murder may be linked to other violent deaths in the same area.According to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, detectives are looking closely at whether Johnson’s killing connects to at least three other deaths involving unhoused people. All of the cases happened within a few blocks of each other. The timeline also stands out, stretching from fall 2025 into early 2026. Because of these similarities, authorities are asking a hard question. Are these random attacks, or is someone deliberately targeting people living in encampments?Kevin Johnson once played professional football at the highest level. He played defensive tackle in the NFL during the 1990s for the Philadelphia Eagles and the Oakland Raiders. After that, he continued his career in the Arena Football League with the Orlando Predators and the Los Angeles Avengers.Over time, Johnson fell on difficult days. Authorities say he was living in the same encampment where he was later killed. Investigators believe his death happened during a violent attack, not an accident.What has shaken detectives is what followed. The Sheriff’s Department confirmed it is reviewing three other deaths that happened nearby over the past few months. In one case, a victim was shot. In another, a person was beaten to death. Officials have not shared details about a third case, but they confirmed it is part of the same investigation.Investigators say all the victims were part of the same vulnerable group and lived in the same general area. The timing is also close, which adds to the concern.The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has not said a serial killer has been identified. However, officials admit the pattern is worrying. Detectives are now working to learn whether these attacks are connected or if different suspects are involved.Authorities are urging anyone who saw something unusual near homeless encampments in South Los Angeles to speak up. Even small details could help, police said.As the investigation grows, Johnson’s death has become a key case in understanding whether this violence is random or something much more dangerous.",Former NFL player Kevin Johnson was found dead in a homeless encampment in South Los Angeles on January 21.

VTubers continue to rise in popularity on the leading streaming platforms, but January 2026 was undoubtedly the month of TheBurntPeanut. The VTuber was still basking in the glory of being named VTuber of the Year when it reached the pinnacle of Twitch’s viewership rankings. According to the latest statistics provided by StreamsCharts, TheBurntPeanut topped the list of most-watched streamers on the platform, leaving some of the largest names on the site, such as Asmongold, Hasan, and Caedrel, in its wake.TheBurntPeanut is recognized for his minimalist yet chaotic visual aesthetic. He employs a face filter reminiscent of Snapchat, where his head is transformed into a giant peanut while maintaining his actual eyes and mouth in a cartoon-like fashion. This distinct approach has allowed him to differentiate himself from other content creators. His live streams of ARC Raiders and Escape from Tarkov have garnered enormous popularity. Consequently, his Twitch subscribers have increased to 1.8 million, making him one of the elite content creators on the platform.According to StreamsCharts, TheBurntPeanut had a remarkable 11.3 million hours viewed in January 2026.This represented a 29% increase from December 2025, which was accomplished in just over 196 hours of total streaming time. His ARC Raiders streams remained popular, despite his open criticism of issues such as cheating and stream sniping. At one stage, the VTuber threatened to leave the game if the developers did not resolve these issues, further heightening the drama of his streams.Behind him, Asmongold finished second with 8.40 million hours watched. Hasan followed with 6.82 million hours, despite receiving a brief Twitch ban late in the month. Caedrel also posted strong numbers, reaching 7.14 million hours watched thanks to his coverage of LEC and LCK League of Legends matches. Other familiar names, including GamesDoneQuick, Jynxzi, StableRonaldo, xQc, Caseoh, and Japanese streamer Junichi, rounded out the broader top rankings.The results of January are a testament to the strength of TheBurntPeanut’s momentum. Although it is early in the year 2026, it seems that TheBurntPeanut has set the bar very high. Whether he will be able to sustain this position or whether new competition will emerge is one of the most intriguing stories on Twitch.","TheBurntPeanut topped the list of most-watched streamers on Twitch in January 2026.

Sam Darnold injury update: Mike Macdonald shares encouraging take on Seahawks QB’s ahead of Super Bowl LX,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/sam-darnold-injury-update-mike-macdonald-shares-encouraging-take-on-seahawks-qbs-ahead-of-super-bowl-lx/articleshow/127918381.cms,"Image via AP Photo

What did Mike Macdonald say about Sam Darnold injury?

As Super Bowl LX draws near, Seahawks fans can breathe easier after an encouraging injury update for quarterback Sam Darnold from head coach Mike Macdonald. Darnold has been managing an oblique issue but appears ready to lead the Seattle Seahawks against the New England Patriots on February 8 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California.Darnold first suffered the oblique strain during practice ahead of the NFC Divisional Round, but he did not miss a game because of it. In fact, he played through the injury in the Seahawks’ dominant 41-6 win over the San Francisco 49ers and the 31-27 NFC Championship victory over the Los Angeles Rams key performances that sent Seattle to the Super Bowl.Macdonald has given several updates on Darnold’s condition in recent days, suggesting the injury is not a major concern. The coach said the 28-year-old “is in a great spot” with his oblique and confident heading into the final game. Macdonald also noted that the Seahawks have gradually increased Darnold’s work in practices, although he has been limited at times.Earlier in the playoffs, Darnold’s throwing was restricted in practice sessions as he continued to recover. Macdonald said at that time that the team was monitoring his reps and progressing day by day, but there was no indication that the injury would stop him from playing.Despite limited practice repetitions, his playoff play has remained strong. Against the Rams, he threw for 346 yards and three touchdowns, guiding the Seahawks to a hard-fought win in the NFC Championship Game. His performance showed that the injury had little to no impact on his ability to play at a high level when it mattered most.With an extra week between the NFC Championship and Super Bowl, Darnold has had additional time to continue strengthening his oblique. There is strong confidence within the Seahawks organisation that he will be able to perform effectively in the championship game. Coaches and team officials have described his recovery as tracking well, and he is expected to be near full strength for the big game.Fans have noticed how Darnold has handled adversity this season. After earlier injury concerns, he has shown toughness and resilience, bouncing back to deliver impressive performances during the playoffs. That mental and physical strength has become one of the defining stories of his season.As the Seahawks fine-tune their preparations for Super Bowl LX, the focus for Seattle will be on health and execution. With his oblique issue under control and key performances under his belt, Sam Darnold is expected to take the field and lead his team’s offence in what could be a career-defining moment.","Sam Darnold has been managing an oblique issue but appears ready to lead the Seattle Seahawks against the New England Patriots.

Who is Mickey Lolich’s wife Joyce Fleenor? Meet the woman behind the Tigers’ 1968 World Series hero,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/who-is-mickey-lolichs-wife-joyce-fleenor-meet-the-woman-behind-the-tigers-1968-world-series-hero/articleshow/127918307.cms,"Mickey Lolich (Image Source: X)

From airline stewardess to supportive partner

A lasting bond beyond Mickey Lolich’s baseball career

Joyce Fleenor was more than the woman next to Detroit Tigers pitcher Mickey Lolich. She was his companion through the highs and lows of a great baseball career, his anchor for more than sixty years. Fleenor married him in November 1964 and became a rock for the young left-hander who matured from a promising rookie into one of the most reliable pitchers in the majors.Mickey Lolich remains in the minds of generations of Tigers fans as the bulldog on the mound who carried Detroit to the top during the special summer of 1968. Behind all the glitz and glamour, though, his success is grounded in family. Every victory, every loss, Joyce Fleenor was there alongside him, molding the man behind the uniform, forging a partnership that lasted long after the last pitch was thrown.Joyce Fleenor led a life that had nothing to do with sports before she became known as the wife of a baseball star. Her high-flying California job as an airline stewardess was a marker of independence and also associated with self-assurance. Around this time, she met a young Mickey Lolich, just starting his path through the Tigers organisation. They became serious quickly, and the pair wed on November 21, 1964.The development of Lolich during those early years was crucial to the outcome of his career.Fleenor was a steadying presence during the adjustment to the demands of pro ball. Her calm personality tempered Lolich's intensity, friends and teammates noticed. This maturation was also attributed to the pitcher's wife, who helped him. They grew a family, three kids, while managing the day-to-day ins and outs of a Major League schedule.One of the highlights of Mickey Lolich's professional career came during the 1968 World Series, as he delivered one of the best postseason pitching performances in history. He won three games, including three complete games, and was named MVP as Detroit came back to beat the St. Louis Cardinals. While the spotlight focused on the mound, Joyce Fleenor participated in that victory because she shared in every step of the journey with her husband.In the late 70s, when Lolich retired from baseball, the couple opted for a more subdued life outside the stadiums. They continued to participate in the community and kept ties to Detroit, the town that had honored his success. Although Fleenor remained reclusive, he was a very family-oriented and charitable person.",Joyce Fleenor was the wife of Detroit Tigers pitcher Mickey Lolich. The couple married in November 1964 and had three children. FleenOr worked as an airline stewardess before becoming a wife and mother. Lolich was named MVP of the 1968 World Series after winning three games.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127918303,imgsize-898584,width-400,resizemode-4/mickey-lolich.jpg"

The Baby in Yellow

Evil Nun: The Scary Horror Game

Ice Scream





GHAZIABAD: A diary left behind by three minor sisters who died by suicide in Ghaziabad offers a troubling window into the digital universe they had increasingly withdrawn into — one dominated by horror-survival games, repetitive tasks and online walkthroughs. Clinical psychologists say the handwritten notes reflect how deeply the girls had retreated into virtual worlds as their real-life social space steadily narrowed.The diary, accessed by The Times of India, lists four mobile games the sisters were intensely engaged with: Poppy Playtime, The Baby in Yellow, Evil Nun: The Scary Horror Game and Ice Scream. All belong to the horror or puzzle-survival genre, placing players in confined, threatening environments where escape is the central objective. While Poppy Playtime requires an initial payment of around Rs 300, the other titles are free to download but rely heavily on in-app purchases.Developed by Mob Entertainment, Poppy Playtime is a first-person puzzle-horror game set inside an abandoned toy factory. Players assume the role of a former employee who returns to uncover what happened to the missing workers, only to be hunted by grotesque, animated toys.Progress depends on solving environmental puzzles, avoiding enemies and navigating dark, claustrophobic spaces. The game has crossed 10 lakh downloads on Google Play, carries a 12+ age rating and charges around Rs 300 to begin playing. Its official description urges players to “stay alive” and “survive the vengeful toys waiting for you.”Developed by Team Terrible, The Baby in Yellow blends horror with dark humour. The player acts as a babysitter tasked with routine chores such as feeding, changing diapers and putting a baby to sleep, while increasingly disturbing paranormal events unfold.The game relies heavily on jump scares, eerie sound design and visual shocks. It has gained massive global popularity, recording over 10 crore downloads worldwide.Created by Keplerians Games, Evil Nun is set inside a school controlled by a terrifying nun transformed after a zombie-like infection. Players must solve puzzles, free trapped children and escape the premises without being caught. The game features multiple chapters and endings and has amassed more than 5 crore downloads.Also developed by Keplerians Games, Ice Scream revolves around an ice-cream vendor who kidnaps children and freezes them inside his van. Set in a small town, the game requires players to hide, sneak and solve clues while avoiding detection. Like Evil Nun, it is part of a multi-chapter franchise and has crossed 5 crore downloads.Their father, Chetan Kumar, told TOI that the sisters had been playing task-based online games for at least two to three years and were deeply fascinated by Korean culture. They gave one another Korean names and often spoke about wanting to visit the country. Investigators believe the youngest sibling may have started playing these games before the age of 10, despite most of the applications recommending a minimum age of 12.The diary suggests gaming was not casual recreation but a shared routine. Along with playing, the sisters regularly watched YouTube livestreams of gamers playing the same titles — videos that often heighten fear and suspense through exaggerated reactions, jump scares and constant tension.Experts caution against drawing direct or simplistic links between violent games and suicide. “It would be unfair to blame games alone,” said clinical psychologist Pulkit Sharma. “But patterns like these need to be understood as a possible cry for help, especially when children increasingly isolate themselves from the real world.”",Three minor sisters died by suicide in Ghaziabad.

GHAZIABAD: Writings on the wall of the room where the three sisters who died by suicide on Wednesday spent all their day offer the clearest path into the minds of the trio, indicating they battled extreme loneliness. ""I am very, very alone"", ""My life is very very alone"" and ""Make me a heart of broken"", they had scribbled.The eldest girl to die (16) and her two half-sisters had not been going to school since Covid, nor were they homeschooled. Leading a sequestered life, they did not go to the society compound to play with other children either. They were each other's best friends, inseparable through the day. South Korea, what they knew of it from K-pop, music and dramas, seemed to have become their refuge in this extreme isolation, to the point that the sisters called each other by names borrowed from TV shows – Maria, Aliza and Cindy – and appeared to be living in a parallel world from which they shut their parents out.And the more they disapproved of it, the stronger the bitterness appeared to have become.In the diary, which TOI has seen, they listed 19 things the parents could have approved of but did not, among which were not just K-dramas but also Chinese, Japanese, Thai, American and ‘London' (British) music and actors, besides cartoon shows Shin-chan and Doraemon, and mobile games.""You don't know how much we loved Korea, now see the proof. Now it's confirmed here that Korean and K-pop groups are our life.The way we loved Korean actors and K-pop groups, we didn't even love family members that much,"" the sisters, aged 16, 14 and 12, wrote in the diary.Saying they wanted to make Devu (younger sister aged 4) ""our own"", the sisters admonished the parents for introducing her to ""Amayra, Akshita and Anaya"". You made her Bollywood, which we hated more than life itself. ""And when we introduced Devu to our K-pop and Korean relatives and said that Lino is your brother so you should call him Lino bhaiya and Kuina didi, Tina mummy came and said teach her some studies too, or will you make her Korean like yourself,"" they wrote in the diary.This episode, they wrote, made them decide that they would separate Devu from their lives. The diary also contains references to beatings. It's not clear from who. ""Did we live in this world to get beaten by you… death would be better for us than beatings,"" they wrote. And another cryptic reference is to marriage, for which the girls were too young. ""The mention of marriage caused tension in our hearts.""Police suspect the diary was written by the 14-year-old girl. They have sent it for a forensic analysis.But simmering below this fantasy world of the children was a grim reality of a household in turmoil, both financial and personal. While their father Chetan Kumar, a stock trader, is believed to be deep in debt, because of which he apparently could not afford to send the daughters to school after Covid, he was also facing marital trouble.Two of his partners had walked out in May 2025 and Chetan had filed missing person's reports at Teela Mod police station. After a few days, both returned. Police investigation revealed Chetan faced losses during Covid and took loans after that.","The eldest girl to die (16) and her two half-sisters had not been going to school since Covid.

Keifer Sherwood to appear with the San Jose Sharks against the Colorado Avalanche

Keifer Sherwood is all set to make his debut with the San Jose Sharks on Wednesday, as the team locks horns with the Colorado Avalanche. As per reports, the player was on injured reserve with an upper-body issue, but was a full participant in the Sharks’ 45-minute practice in Chicago on Tuesday. He was sidelined for a month.According to Mercury, he skated on the team’s top line alongside Macklin Celebrini and Will Smith. In this season, Sherwood has 17 goals and 23 points in 44 outings in 2025-26. Meanwhile, he would join the lineup with Macklin Celebrini and Will Smith. The player who was on injured reserve is signed to a 2-year, $3 million contract with a cap hit of $1.5 million per season, playing for the San Jose Sharks.The San Jose Sharks have activated Keifer Sherwood off waivers, and the star forward is all set to play against Colorado on Wednesday, as reported by Curtis Pashelka of The San Jose Mercury News. Earlier, he was sidelined for about a month due to an undisclosed injury. After staying away from the team for nearly a month, Sherwood declined to specify the exact nature of the injury, saying he was preparing for his return.Recently, the San Jose Sharks star shared on Hockey Digest, “It was good. It’s an exciting, fun group, and just trying to be a part of it and get acclimated. Have a good practice. Just take it day by day. Try to get the body and the mind better each day, and just prepare. You always prepare like you’re gonna play.” (source: Yahoo Sports)It is important to note that Sherwood was acquired from the Vancouver Canucks on Jan.19, but has been kept away from the team since Jan. 10 due to an upper-body injury. Before joining the Sharks, Sherwood was leading the Canucks in goals, scoring 17 goals and six assists for 23 points in 44 games. He was indeed one of Vancouver’s most productive forwards before the trade and injury.The 30-year-old forward was acquired in exchange for defenseman Cole Clayton and second-round draft picks in both 2026 and 2027. According to reports, he was in the final year of his two-year, $3 million contract and was set to become an unrestricted free agent this summer. His return would surely boost the San Jose Sharks’ strength as the team sits sixth in the Pacific Division at 27-23-4.","The San Jose Sharks have activated Keifer Sherwood off waivers.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Kamran Akmal has strongly criticised the International Cricket Council (ICC) for urging the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to reconsider its decision to boycott the high-profile group match against India at the upcoming T20 World Cup. The mega event will be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.Pakistan left for Sri Lanka on Monday to begin their World Cup campaign and are currently awaiting any possible action from the ICC following their refusal to play India in the tournament. While India are co-hosting the event, Pakistan will play all of their matches in Sri Lanka — including any knockout fixtures — due to ongoing political tensions between the two neighbours.The situation escalated on Sunday when Pakistan’s government instructed the team to participate in the World Cup but boycott the February 15 group match against India in Colombo. The tournament begins on Saturday, with Pakistan scheduled to open their campaign against the Netherlands.Cricketing relations between India and Pakistan have remained strained, with political issues frequently spilling onto the field.During last year’s Asia Cup in the United Arab Emirates, Indian players refused to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts across three matches, including the final. India also left without collecting the trophy after declining to accept it from Asian Cricket Council president Mohsin Naqvi.With the PCB yet to formally communicate its stance to the ICC, Akmal has urged the board to remain firm.“PCB should not back down! The ICC has told the Pakistan Cricket Board to reconsider its stance of boycotting the India game. Was ICC sleeping when the Asia Cup happened in the hybrid model? Was ICC sleeping when India said it would not play the Champions Trophy in Pakistan and only play on a neutral venue? How many times has Pakistan played in India, despite the heightened tensions between the two countries. I have gone myself. The ICC should have thought of these things three years back!” Akmal said on the YouTube channel ‘Game Plan’.Akmal further questioned the ICC’s consistency in handling political sensitivities in international cricket.“The two countries have not played bilateral series for years now. Wasn’t that also politics? Shouldn’t the ICC have thought of ending the politics then? The PCB’s decision should be respected just as we respected India’s decision to play in hybrid model. Things had gotten to such extreme levels. At the Asia Cup, they refused to shake hands with our players, then refused to accept the trophy (from ACC chief Mohsin Naqvi. They had disrespected us!”Following Pakistan government’s announcement, the ICC released a statement saying it was still awaiting official communication from the PCB.“While the ICC awaits official communication from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), this position of selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule,” the ICC statement read.“The ICC hopes that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of… ICC expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders.”","Pakistan left for Sri Lanka on Monday to begin their World Cup campaign.

A dominant series win against New Zealand offered India more than just momentum, it brought clarity. Suryakumar Yadav rediscovered his touch, Ishan Kishan and Shivam Dube forced their way into the conversation with explosive returns, Rinku Singh underlined his growing allround value and the bowling blueprint fell into place. ..SURYA’S TIMELY RETURN TO FORM: A 4–1 series win capped a satisfying T20I outing against New Zealand for India captain Suryakumar Yadav. “There’s no difference between the Surya of 2025 and now — I was just out of runs then,” he said. Leading the run charts with 242, Surya stood out less for the numbers than for his clarity: secure in his method and buoyed by the team’s momentum.ISHAN TEES OFF: Frozen out before the series, Kishan forced his way back with three explosive knocks — 76 off 32, 28 off 13 and a blistering 103 off 43 — firmly announcing his World Cup intent. By the end of the series, he had reclaimed the wicketkeeping gloves, pushing Sanju Samson to the fringes.DUBE FLEXES ALLROUND MUSCLE: Dube added power and balance, striking 36 off 18 and 65 off 23 to finish with the second-highest strike rate (248.9).

NAVI MUMBAI: It may have just been just a warm-up match, but the message coming out from the Indian dressing room was loud and clear. Ishan Kishan , in red-hot form currently, will open for India in the 2026 T20 World Cup, ahead of the struggling Sanju Samson On Wednesday night at the DY Patil Stadium here, Kishan cleared the audition to start along with Abhishek Sharma at the top with flying colours, smashing a blistering 20-ball 53 in a World Cup tune-up against South Africa. His knock included as many as seven cleanly-struck sixes and a couple of fours.Choosing to bat first, India raced away to 240 for five, with their in-form batters blasting 19 sixes. The hosts then restricted South Africa to 210 for seven to log a 30-run win in the high-scoring encounter.Samson’s fate seemed to have been sealed at the toss itself, when skipper Suryakumar Yadav made it clear that he wanted to try Kishan in the opener’s role. Kishan seized the opportunity brilliantly, unleashing all his nine boundaries within the first six overs, thus maximising the Powerplay overs and giving the 45,000 capacity crowd that turned up plenty to cheer about.The explosive left-hander retired after the Powerplay, allowing Tilak Varma to get some valuable batting practice ahead of the tournament.Following up on his 38 for India ‘A’ at the same venue on Monday against USA, Varma hammered 45 off just 19 balls, carting three sixes and as many fours.Kishan earned his promotion to the opener role after displaying spectacular form in the five-match home T20I series against New Zealand, where he scored 215 runs in four matches at a strike rate of 231.20, including a 42-ball century in the final game in Thiruvananthapuram while batting at No 3. It helped the Ranchi ’keeper-batter that Samson was woefully out of form, having scored merely 46 runs in five matches at an average of just 9.20 and a strike rate of 135.30 in the same series.Taking the attack to South Africa with a fearless display at the very start, Kishan smashed two sixes in the first over of the match, bowled by Lungi Ngidi.Brief scores: India 240/5 (I Kishan 53, T Varma 45) beat South Africa 210/7 (R Rickelton 44, T Stubbs 45*; A Sharma 2/32) by 30 runs.","Ishan Kishan smashes 53 off 20 balls in T20 World Cup warm-up match.

A fresh start for three franchises searching for direction

The league is days away from Super Bowl LX, but three teams have already hit the reset button. While New England and Seattle are preparing for February 8 in Santa Clara, the Giants, Cardinals, and Raiders used the final stretch of the offseason to lock in new leadership. These moves were not about noise. Instead, they were about control, direction, and stopping the cycle of failure.By 2026, all three teams finished major coaching hires. Each team faced certain struggles, but the message was the same. They no longer wanted short-term fixes. They wanted identity. That search led them to three coaches with unique backgrounds, but one shared responsibility: change the culture and win.The N.Y. Giants went straight for experience. They acquired John Harbaugh after he was fired by Baltimore following the 2025 regular season. New York has won only 59 games since 2015 and burned through coaches without finding stability. Harbaugh brings 18 seasons, a Super Bowl title, and instant credibility. He steps into a locker room with real building blocks, including star-QB Jaxson Dart, receiver Malik Nabers, left tackle Andrew Thomas, and defensive star Dexter Lawrence.For the Giants, this is about structure and respect returning to the building.The Arizona Cardinals chose offense and upside. On Feb. 2, 2026, they named Mike LaFleur as their head coach after his Rams unit led the NFL with 6,709 total yards in 2025. Arizona ranked 19th in offense and now faces uncertainty at QB after Kyler Murray played just five games due to a foot injury. With the No. 3 pick in April’s draft and no clear franchise passer available, LaFleur must define a new identity fast.Meanwhile, the Raiders turned to Klint Kubiak, agreeing to terms on Feb. 1, 2026, with the deal set to finalize after Super Bowl LX on Feb. 8. Las Vegas finished last in total offense and holds the No. 1 pick in the 2026 draft. Indiana QB Fernando Mendoza is expected to be their selection, with Geno Smith staying as insurance. Kubiak’s job is simple: build a real offense and give this team a future.With new head coaches in the house, these three teams are all pumped up for an amazing season ahead.","The Giants, Cardinals, and Raiders all hired new head coaches in 2026.

Archie Jackson's Test Career

Matches Innings Runs HS Ave. 100s 50s 8 11 474 164 47.40 1 2

On This Day, February 4, almost a century ago in 1929, a batting genius scored his maiden — and only — century in his debut match for Australia against England in Adelaide. He was 19, and the mammoth 164 as an opener in the fourth Ashes Test was supposed to be his launch pad for cricket stardom. But it did not last.Meet the tragic batting genius — Archie Jackson , who was dubbed ‘as good as’ Don Bradman at that time. Jackson went on to play just eight Tests for Australia before he died from tuberculosis four years after his stunning debut, aged 23.Jackson made his first-class debut at the tender age of 17 after making his name in school-level cricket. Representing New South Wales, Jackson played 70 first-class games, including eight Tests for Australia, scoring 4383 runs at an average of 45.65, which included 11 hundreds and 23 fifties. He played just five seasons before ill health cut short his cricket journey.A graceful batter, Jackson also shared a record partnership of 243 runs for the fourth wicket with none other than Don Bradman at The Oval against England a year into his Test career. Jackson, though, contributed just 73, which turned out to be his second-best score after the debut 164.Archibald Jackson, popularly known as Archie Jackson, was a right-handed top-order batter who could bowl right-arm offbreak.He was born on September 5, 1909, in Lanarkshire, Scotland.He first made his name in school cricket, representing Rozelle School, before making his senior first-class debut for NSW in the 1926/27 season at the age of 17. Two years later, he made his international debut for Australia in the 1928/29 Ashes series.Jackson made his Australia debut in the fourth Test of the 1928/29 Ashes on February 1.England skipper Percy Chapman won the toss on Friday morning and elected to bat first. England openers Jack Hobbs (74) and Herbert Sutcliffe (64) gave the visitors a perfect start, posting 143 for the opening wicket before both were dismissed at the same score — turning 143/0 into 143/2 in no time. But England No.3 Wally Hammond (47*) steered England to 246/5 at stumps on Day 1.Hammond completed his century the next day and remained unbeaten on 119, but the visitors were bowled out for 334. Clarrie Grimmett took a five-wicket haul — 5 for 102 — for Australia.Australia did not start their first innings well, losing three wickets for just 19 on the board. Playing his first innings, the then 19-year-old Jackson held one end intact amid the collapse and revived the Aussie innings along with captain Jack Ryder. The duo completed their half-centuries and took the team to 131/3 at the end of the second day’s play, leaving the match evenly poised heading into the Sunday rest day.On Monday, February 4, Ryder fell for 63 after reviving the innings with a 126-run stand for the fourth wicket with debutant Jackson. Jackson completed his maiden century while adding 82 runs for the next wicket with Bradman (40) to push the total past the 200-mark.When Jackson finally fell LBW to Jack White, who returned figures of 5/130, he had scored a majestic 164 and taken Australia close to the 300-mark.Australia batted through the day and ended at 365/9 before being bowled out for 369 early on Day 4, taking a slender first-innings lead of 35.Hammond followed his unbeaten 119 in the first innings with a mammoth 177 in the second, and with support from Douglas Jardine’s 98, England set Australia a target of 349 runs.Young Jackson scored 36 in the second innings and added 65 for the opening wicket with Bill Woodfull (30). Australia’s middle order contributed well, with Alan Kippax (51), Ryder (87) and Bradman (58) reaching half-centuries, but regular wickets after Kippax’s dismissal left Australia in a tough spot. The hosts were eventually dismissed for 336, 13 runs short of the target, losing the tightly contested match by 12 runs.White was the wrecker-in-chief for England, returning excellent figures of 8 for 126 to go with his 5 for 130 in the first innings.Australia lost the match, but young Jackson announced his arrival on the international stage with a big hundred. It did not last long, however, as seven Tests and four years later, Jackson died on February 16, 1933, at Clayfield, Brisbane, aged 23 years and 164 days.","Archie Jackson made his Test debut for Australia against England on February 1, 1929.

Artemi Panarin’s extension demands complicates NY Rangers’ trade talks as the Olympic freeze begins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/artemi-panarins-extension-demands-complicates-ny-rangers-trade-talks-as-the-olympic-freeze-begins/articleshow/127912481.cms,"Aretmi Panarin with the Rangers (Via Getty Images)

Artemi Panarin’s $50 Million demands make things hard for potential buyers

The NHL's Olympic roster freeze officially kicks in today at 3 PM EDT and runs through February 22. That gives the Rangers and the rest of the league just hours to complete any transactions before the trade market goes dark for nearly three weeks.All eyes are on one player. And that player is in no rush to make things easy. Artemi Panarin has been held out of the Rangers' last three games for what the team has called ""roster management"" purposes. But this holdup is not due to a lack of interest from the teams.Panarin, who leads the Rangers with 57 points in 52 games this season, hasn't suited up since January 26. The organization's message is clear. His time in New York is coming to an end, and according to The Athletic's Vince Mercogliano, six teams remain in the mix for Panarin.The issue is the winger's insistence on having a contract extension in place as part of any deal. Panarin is reportedly seeking roughly $50 million on what could be the final contract of his career, a figure that has given several suitors pause.His agent, Paul Theofanous, has been working through the options, but the process has been slow. Panarin holds a full no-movement clause in the final year of his seven-year, $81.5 million contract, giving him complete control over his destination.Multiple league sources believe the Florida Panthers remain his preferred landing spot. The Tampa Bay Lightning have also generated recent buzz. But the extension piece presents a significant challenge for both Sunshine State teams, whose salary cap situations make a long-term commitment difficult to structure.The Carolina Hurricanes and Los Angeles Kings offer more cap flexibility to accommodate an extension. The San Jose Sharks and Washington Capitals reportedly have the most appealing trade assets to send back to the Rangers.Mercogliano has noted that Panarin does not want to go the rental route, which narrows the field considerably. Rangers president and general manager Chris Drury faces limited leverage in negotiations, particularly if Panarin gives him only one team to work with.Letting a pending unrestricted free agent walk for nothing at the March 6 trade deadline would be a disastrous outcome for a team sitting last in the Eastern Conference at 22-28-6. Both sides would prefer a resolution before the freeze.But if Panarin's demands remain firm and the cap math doesn't add up, this saga could easily stretch into late February once the Olympic break ends.","Artemi Panarin has been held out of the Rangers' last three games for what the team has called ""roster management"" Panarin is reportedly seeking roughly $50 million on what could be the final contract of his career. Panarin holds a full no-movement clause in the final year of his seven-year, $81.5 million contract.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127912583,imgsize-90192,width-400,resizemode-4/artemi-panarin.jpg"

Cooper Flagg’s historic three-game stretch

Flagg’s is stepping up amid Mavericks’ roster turmoil

Dallas Mavericks rookie Cooper Flagg just made another NBA record on Tuesday night by becoming the first teenager to drop three consecutive 30-point games. Despite Flagg’s 36-point outburst, the Dallas Mavericks fell 100-110 to the visiting Boston Celtics at the American Airlines Center. The 19-year-old phenom continues to rewrite the rookie record books, surpassing various rookie records set by LeBron James and Luka Doncic.Flagg’s historic night against the Celtics saw him clock in 37 minutes on the court, while finishing the match with 36 points, 9 rebounds, 6 assists, and 2 blocks. He also shot at an efficiency of 50.0%, converting 12-of-24 from the field and 2-of-4 from three-point range. While the Mavericks are struggling with a five-game losing streak, Flagg’s individual brilliance as a teenager on the court continues to reach unprecedented heights.Flagg’s current scoring tear with 20.1 points, 6.7 rebounds, 4.2 assists, and a 48.4% efficiency from the field is statistically among the greatest rookie spans in NBA’s history. In his last three outings, Flagg has averaged a staggering 39.7 points, 10.3 rebounds, and 4.7 assists.This stretch of staggering performances began with Flagg’s career-high of 49 points against the Charlotte Hornets on January 29, followed by a 34-point double-double against the Houston Rockets, and the recent 36 points against the Boston Celtics.During the last three-game window, Flagg also showcased an elite shooting efficiency, 57.7% from the floor, 46.2% from beyond the arc, and 85.2% from the free-throw line.The Mavericks’ front office’s intention since winning the draft lottery despite the 1.8% chance has been clear: draft Duke’s Cooper Flagg and build a contender-worthy team around him.Since getting drafted, Copper’s need on the court increased exponentially as the Mavericks navigated through the injuries of their veteran core. With Kyrie Irving still recovering from a long-term ACL injury and Anthony Davis sidelined with a hand injury since early January, the No. 1 overall pick has effectively transitioned into the focal point of the Dallas offense.But with a 6-foot-9 height and 7-foot wingspan, Flagg’s impact is not just limited to scoring. He led the Mavericks in both total points (926) and steals per game (1.2). Following Tuesday's loss to Boston, Dallas head coach Jason Kidd said, “Cooper was incredible,” while also highlighting his impressive scoring ability and playmaking skills for his teammates.","Dallas Mavericks rookie Cooper Flagg just made another NBA record by becoming the first teenager to drop three consecutive 30-point games.

Allen’s Super Bowl mindset stays the same even after another painful playoff ending

Bills MVP QB Josh Allen talks Super Bowl pressure, Bond with Sam Darnold ahead of SB LX | FTF

Josh Allen will be sitting out Super Bowl LX as the Bills failed to come out on top, and that reality continues to sting for Buffalo. The Bills' star just won the 2024 NFL MVP award, adding to a growing list of records. Still, the one thing missing from his career is a Super Bowl appearance, which he still dreams about every day.In a recent appearance on a podcast, the QB revealed that his ultimate aim is to win the Super Bowl trophy, and he would never stop until he achieves it. Allen also revealed that despite the setbacks with the 2025 season, he does not dwell on it for long and instead prefers to focus on what’s next.Allen appeared on the First Things First podcast and spelled out his mission with no hesitation. “Every year, my goal is to go win a Super Bowl and bring a trophy back to Western New York. Obviously, the ultimate goal is to win a Super Bowl, and it takes so much throughout the season to get there and to go out and win it. And I’m going to keep working tirelessly until we get that opportunity to get it done.”He also explained that he tries not to obsess over outcomes because his love for the game is what keeps him going through the long grind of an NFL season.Since being drafted seventh overall in 2018, Allen has been the face of Buffalo’s rise. The Bills have reached the playoffs seven times with him as the starter, including two trips to the AFC Championship Game.For years, Kansas City was the wall Buffalo could not break through. That rivalry shaped Allen’s postseason story, from the 2020 AFC title loss to later playoff exits. This past season, the door looked more open after Patrick Mahomes’ injury changed the AFC landscape. Still, Buffalo’s run ended in the divisional round against the Denver Broncos.Allen did not dodge responsibility afterward during the press conference, saying, “I’d be lying to you if I’m sitting here saying that I feel like I had a part in it because if I make one more play, that game in Denver, we’re probably not having this press conference right now. The Bills lost 33-30, even though Allen threw for 283 yards and accounted for three touchdowns.","Josh Allen won the 2024 NFL MVP award, adding to a growing list of records.
