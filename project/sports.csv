NEW DELHI: Pakistan drew criticism from all quarters following their defeat against England in the first Test despite posting a massive total of over 500 runs in the first innings. However, former coach Mickey Arthur raised concerns about certain issues that affected the team's performance.Arthur emphasized that Pakistani players have the talent to compete at the highest level and urged for greater consistency in team selection and management to enhance their performance.""Just a few thoughts as a follower of Pakistan cricket ! 1.The players are very very skilled and are the right one's. 2.The inconsistency around selection, environment and administration plays a role in team morale, give the players structure and they will perform!,"" Arthur posted on X.Arthur also criticized the media's role in over-promoting players, which he believes can create a false sense of self-importance. He argued that this excessive attention often disconnects players from reality, leading them to lose focus on team objectives and overestimate their own significance.""3.The vile rhetoric from media and media driven agendas do not help! 4.The promotion of players by player agents or media makes the player sometimes think he is way more important than he is in reality creating a false view! 5.Playing for Pakistan should be the best time ever!"" Arthur added.England's bowlers, led by spinner Jack Leach, dismantled Pakistan’s batting order to claim victory in the first Test in Multan on Friday, following a game-changing record partnership between Harry Brook and Joe Root On Day 5, England's attack quickly dismissed Pakistan's last four batters, bowling the hosts out for 200 and securing an innings-and-47-run win.This marked England's fourth consecutive Test victory on Pakistani soil, following a 3-0 whitewash two years ago. Before that, England had won just two away Tests against Pakistan in the previous 61 years.Pakistan have gone 11 Tests without a win on home grounds, their last win against South Africa came in February 2021.The second Test starts at the same venue from Tuesday while the third is in Rawalpindi from October 24.",Former Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur criticizes media for over-promoting players.

Harmanpreet & Co. Face tough test in their quest to make it to the semis

There's an aura of invincibility that surrounds the Australian women's team. They don't wear it heavily on their sleeve, but it's on show when they show their skills on the field. Their runaway nine-wicket win over Pakistan in the ICC T20 World Cup fixture on Friday is a case in point.On Sunday, when the Indian team takes on their nemesis from Down Under in Sharjah , their enviable 14-match winning streak in T20 World Cups will not be lost on Harmanpreet Kaur and Co.Australia are all but through to the semifinals, but India have a lot riding on this match. Australia are currently placed on top with six points and a net run rate of 2.78 while India lie second with four points from three games and an NRR of 0.576.To secure their place in the last four, they will have to get past the Australians or ride on luck in a tight group where only Sri Lanka is out of contention. NRR will then be the deciding factor.Australia will get a chance to test their bench strength after captain Alyssa Healy left the field during the Pakistan game due to an injury to her right foot and fast bowler Tayla Vlaeminck dislocated her shoulder.But the Indian side, after clinching an 82-run win over Sri Lanka, will not take the defending champions lightly as they play their first game in Sharjah.Incidentally, an Indian team takes to the field in Sharjah after nearly 24 years.While Indian openers - Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma returned to form against Lanka and looked more settled and composed in the middle along with captain Harmanpreet, the rest of the Indian lineup will hope to get some runs under their belt.Though India have tested Australia in the past, the reigning champions remain overwhelming favourites.","India take on Australia in their opening game of the ICC T20 World Cup in Sharjah.

NEW DELHI: Nothing seems to be going Pakistan's way. After losing a home series to Bangladesh, they have now suffered a crushing defeat to England.In the first Test against England, Pakistan appeared to be in control, posting a huge first-innings total of 556. However, they crumbled to an innings and 47-run defeat in Multan.This marked a historic low in Test cricket, as Pakistan became the first team to lose by an innings after scoring over 500 runs in their first innings.This defeat extends Pakistan’s losing streak in Test cricket to six consecutive matches and their seventh home loss in nine Tests, highlighting their ongoing struggles.Remarkably, this Test was only the second in history to produce a result despite both teams scoring over 550 runs.The other was the 2022 Rawalpindi Test, also between Pakistan and England.In contrast, all 15 previous Tests with two 550-plus totals had ended in draws.The run rate of 4.51 across the three innings in Multan is the second highest for a Test match that lasted over 2,000 balls, surpassed only by the 4.54 rate in the 2022 Rawalpindi Test between these sides.Pakistan bowled 150 overs, conceding just one maiden, setting a new record for the most overs bowled in a Test innings with only one maiden.The previous record was 709 balls (88.5 eight-ball overs) by South Africa against England in Durban, 1939.England’s monumental 823/7 declared was powered by Harry Brook’s triple century and Joe Root ’s career-best 262, leaving Pakistan reeling before they were bowled out for 220 in their second innings, sealing the dominant victory for England.""We've spoken about the third innings or fourth innings, but at the end of the day it's a team game. Everything has its advantages or repercussions as a team. When you put up 550 on the board, it's important to back it up with 10 wickets. 220 runs in the third innings, depending on what kind of lead you have can also be a good score. England found a way to get those 20 wickets. We also have to find a way to do that. That's the challenge a side has to go forward,"" Pakistan captain Shan Masood said after the match.""We're in the middle of the series, we've talked about squad mentality and consistency. No matter how the pitch is, we have to find a way out. England showed that. Sometimes you get conditions in your favour, sometimes you don't. It's a non-negotiable of Test cricket to perform on a consistent basis. We love playing the game. We're obviously hurt by the results, hurt as a nation. I never try and shy away from responsibility. What hurts is that we're not getting the results that Pakistan cricket deserves. We are trying to turn it around,"" he said.","England beat Pakistan by an innings and 47 runs in the first Test in Multan.

Top Picks For You Jasprit Bumrah to be Rohit Sharma's deputy in home Test series against New Zealand

WHY SHAMI MISSES OUT?

INDIA ON TOP

NEW DELHI: The Indian selectors have announced a 15-member squad for the upcoming three-match Test series against New Zealand, with some notable changes.

Bumrah's promotion is likely part of the team's plans for the upcoming five-match series against Australia.In the pace department, Bumrah will be supported by Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep if the team management opts for a three-pronged pace attack. The travelling reserves include young pacer Mayank Yadav, who impressed on his debut against Bangladesh, and Prasidh Krishna, providing additional cover if needed.Shami, who has been out of action since the Men's World Cup final against Australia in November last year, remains unavailable for selection.He underwent surgery after sustaining an injury during the World Cup and is targeting a return for the Australia series.The spin-friendly wickets in India have allowed Shami more time to recover and prepare for the crucial series against Australia.The squad remains heavily reliant on spin, with Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, and Kuldeep Yadav vying for spots in the playing XI.The selectors have not picked a backup opener, with Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal expected to take on the responsibility, as they did against Bangladesh.Shubman Gill is likely to continue batting at No.3, while Rishabh Pant and Dhruv Jurel are the wicketkeeping options.India currently lead the World Test Championships (WTC) standings, while New Zealand, the 2021 title-winners, sits in sixth place.The series against New Zealand is crucial for India to consolidate their position in the WTC standings ahead of the important tour of Australia later this year.India aim to reach the WTC final for the third time, having lost to New Zealand and Australia in the previous two editions.New Zealand last visited India in 2021-22 for a two-match series, which the hosts won 1-0.","India announce 15-member squad for three-match Test series against New Zealand.

HYDERABAD: Impressed with India's dominating show in the first two T20Is, assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate said that they are trying to push the boundaries as a team. He also said that the depth in the squad helps them try different combinations with the Champions Trophy Asia Cup and T20 World Cup in mind.""We believe as a group we want to push boundaries. The way we played in Kanpur (second Test against Bangladesh ) was a great example.We've obviously got the quality to do it, and then give the players the belief to do it in a safe space, to know that if it's not going to go right, it's also okay,"" he said ahead of India's third T20I.Ten Doeschate said that players on the bench may get a chance. ""The plan was to win the series and try a few new faces for the last game. We try to expose as many guys as we can to international experience. Someone like Harshit Rana , we're keen to give a game to. Obviously, Tilak (Varma) came into the squad later. Jitesh (Sharma) is there as well. We want to give Sanju another chance,"" he said.Ten Doeschate attributed the better six-hitting ability of the Indians to IPL. ""There's two reasons behind that. It's the way we've bowled that has made it difficult for Bangladesh to hit sixes. But the guys all play enough IPL where there's that opportunity to learn about hitting sixes and how to do it. Out of that whole bunch, you look at Nitish Kumar Reddy as more of a touch player. We've got such strong finishers in Hardik Pandya Rinku Singh and Riyan and Washi as well.""The all-round abilities at India's disposal provide them a lot of options. ""We want to build a strong core. We know the Champions Trophy, Asia Cup and the World Cup are coming up. We want to know where everyone stands. There are guys who fill multiple roles, which is important for balance. Hardik not bowling in the last game shows the options in the bowling department,"" he said.Meanwhile, Nic Pothas, the Bangladesh fielding coach said that India are far ahead in terms of quality.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal launched a blistering critique of the current Pakistan team , likening them to a ""locality team"" and accusing the players of prioritizing personal milestones over the team's success.Pakistan found themselves in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons after suffering a humiliating defeat against England in the first Test in Multan on Friday.England dominated across all five days, ultimately securing victory by an innings and 47 runs in the sweltering heat of Multan.Pakistan made unwanted history by becoming the first team in Test cricket to lose a match despite posting a total of over 550 runs in their first innings.Disheartened by the team's performance, Kamran slammed the hosts, labeling them a ""locality team"" and asserting that Pakistan can only manage to win against weaker opponents.""The world must be amazed by the way Pakistan lost. Nobody will believe this. Pakistan side has become a locality team. Even the club team doesn't perform like this. This is the current standard of our team.

Samson's belligerent 111, SKY's 75 help India post 297/6 to set up 133-run win and sweep series 3-0 against Bangladesh

HYDERABAD: India turned up the heat in the final of the three-match T20I series to such levels that it will leave a lasting impression on the Bangladesh bowlers. Sanju Samson , struggling to get going of late, came to the party on Saturday evening when the country celebrated Dussehra and brought up his maiden T20I century.His belligerent 111 off 47 balls was at the centre of India posting 297/6 - the second highest T20I total - against an inexperienced Bangladesh attack on a flat pitch. India completed a 3-0 sweep with a 133-run win.Skipper Suryakumar Yadav too got into the act and hammered 75 off 35 balls. The second-wicket partnership of 173 runs (70b) between the two made sure the Indian innings was on turbo mode right through after they decided to bat. While Samson hit eight sixes, Surya smashed five.The festive crowd at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium couldn't have asked for a better outing as Bangladesh were consigned to playing catch up for most of the innings that saw only 32 dot balls. The four successive boundaries in the second over of the innings off Taskin Ahmed was just an appetizer as Samson got stuck into leggie Rishad Hossain , slamming him for sixes off the last five deliveries of the 10th over.Such was the mayhem caused by the Indian batters that the highest total in T20Is - 315 by Nepal vs Mongolia - looked under threat at one stage after they finished the powerplay at 82/1 and hurried to 152/1 by the halfway stage.The only respite Bangladesh - who could only muster 164/7-got was when one of the light towers went on the blink for a short while in the ninth over of the Indian innings. By then Samson and Yadav had raced past their fifties with some audacious strokeplay. Samson's backfoot punch off Mustafizur Rahman that sailed over the extra cover fence was clearly the pick of the lot.Hardik Pandya (47; 18b; 4x4, 4x6) and Riyan Parag (34; 13b; 1x4, 4x6) added 70 in 26 balls for the fourth wicket.Bangladesh looked out of breath right from the start of the chase. Mayank Yadav dismissed Parvez Emon off the first ball of the Bangladesh innings. Ravi Bishnoi picked up 3/30.","India beat Bangladesh by 133 runs to win T20I series 3-0.

HYDERABAD: Sanju Samson 's ebullient maiden T20 International hundred dotted India's resounding 133-run victory and 3-0 series sweep over a listless Bangladesh here on Saturday.Once India broomed away records like rotten twigs while posting 297 for 6 after electing to bat, it was always a case of eventual margin of win and Bangladesh never really offered a meaningful fight, ending up at 164/7 in the third and final T20I.Pacer Mayank Yadav (2/32) and leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi (3/30) led the hosts' bowling effort.Samson (111, 47 balls, 11x4, 8x6), who hammered the second fastest T20I century by an Indian after Rohit Sharma (35 balls), and skipper Suryakumar Yadav (75, 35 balls, 8x4, 5x6), biffed 173 runs during an electrifying second wicket stand, propelling the hosts past several records.The total was second in the all-time list of the highest T20I team totals behind Nepal's 314 and ahead of Afghanistan's 278/3, and also India's highest in the shortest format.They were purely amazing stats even taking into account a barren pitch and lighting quick outfield.But beyond that cold realm of numbers, Samson's innings was touched by his esoteric genius, the ingredient that makes him compelling and frustrating in equal measure.But the Kerala right-hander chose to display his captivating side on the field on a clement Hyderabad night and Bangladesh withered quickly.Samson needed a big effort after lukewarm outings in the first two matches in Gwalior and New Delhi and, oh boy, did he make it count here!Samson's brand-new purpose found an immediate on-field expression as he pummelled pacer Taskin Ahmed for four consecutive fours -- two cover drives and as many flicks -- in the second over of the innings.It was the perfect teaser for the blockbuster action that unfolded in the next 10.3 overs.The rapid start also helped India move past the early dismissal of opener Abhishek Sharma (4), falling to a poorly-timed pull off slinger quick Tanzim Hasan.Suryakumar was a mere spectator once Samson slipped into top gear with an array of mind-spinning shots. That could be the biggest tribute for the 29-year-old's knock.It is quite tough to put Suryakumar to shade in T20Is but Samson did that with a knock of rare brilliance as India raced to 82 for 1 in Power Play and 152 for 1 after 10 overs.No bowler was spared during the batting extravaganza that was based on the single-minded and simple philosophy of naked aggression.It was so glaring in the 10th over when leg-spinner Rishad Hossain came to bowl. Hossain erred in line and length and Samson creamed him for five consecutive sixes, including a 105-meter monster.But the most stunning shot in Samson's innings was a six off the backfoot off pacer Mustafizur Rahman.Waiting deep inside the crease, Samson judged the slower ball to perfection, and whacked it over extra cover for a maximum, eliciting a dejected shrug and shake of head from the experienced bowler.Soon, he brought up his hundred off 40 balls with a boundary off off-spinner Mahedi Hasan and celebrated with a roar and punch before getting melted into a tight embrace by his captain.Suryakumar reminded the gallery of his presence, smashing Tanzim for three fours and a six while reaching his fifty in 23 balls.But both the batters fell in the space of adding 10 runs. Samson was jettisoned by Mustafizur's well-directed bouncer and Suryakumar became Mahmudullah's last T20I victim, giving a simple catch to Rishad in deep.But by then India had reached 206 for three in the 15th over.That itself was a daunting total but Hardik Pandya (47, 18 balls, 4x4, 4x6) and Riyan Parag (34, 13 balls, 1x4, 4x6) flogged the dead horse to milk a further 70 runs for the fourth wicket as India raced to a massive total.Once Mayank ousted Pervez Hossain in the first ball of Bangladesh innings, they struggled for momentum in the always futile chase of 298.The tourists did not have the resources even to attempt a powerful chase as knocks by Towhid Hridoy (63 not out, 42 balls, 5x4, 3x6 ) and Litton Das (42, 25 balls, 8x4) remained distant specks in the match's scoresheet.",India beat Bangladesh by 133 runs in third and final T20I in Hyderabad.

Mayank Yadav , a young bowler, made a notable impact in the third T20I match against Bangladesh in Hyderabad. In this high-scoring game, India posted an impressive total of 297/6 in their innings, putting pressure on Bangladesh to perform similarly.Yadav, at just 22 years old, played a significant role in curbing Bangladesh's response. On the very first delivery of the second inning, he delivered a short ball that caught Parvez Hossain Emon off guard.Emon attempted to hit big but could not manage a proper shot, resulting in an awkward attempt. Parag, positioned at first slip, quickly moved to his left and took a comfortable catch.Yadav's contribution was crucial in limiting Bangladesh's innings before it could gain momentum.With this feat, Mayank became the fourth bowler in T20I history to take a wicket on the first ball of an innings. He joined an elite group of Indian cricketers that includes Hardik Pandya Arshdeep Singh , and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. Bhuvneshwar Kumar has accomplished this feat three times in his career.In another significant achievement, Sanju Samson became the first Indian wicketkeeper-batter to score a T20I century. This record was set during the third and final T20I against Bangladesh. Samson scored 111 runs off 47 balls, hitting 11 fours and eight sixes, with a strike rate of 236.17.Sanju Samson has a notable record at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, amassing 398 runs in eight innings at an average of 66.33 and a strike rate of 162.44, including one century and two fifties. He also recorded the second-fastest T20I century by players from full-member teams.The fastest T20I century by a full-member team player is held by David Miller of South Africa and Indian captain Rohit Sharma , both achieving the milestone in 35 balls.",Young bowler made a notable impact in the third T20I match against Bangladesh.

Deepak Hooda sizzles with unbeaten 105 as Rajasthan trail by 14 runs against Pondicherry in Ranji Trophy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/deepak-hooda-sizzles-with-unbeaten-105-as-rajasthan-trail-by-14-runs-against-pondicherry-in-ranji-trophy/articleshow/114176307.cms,"Brief Score: Puducherry 1st innings: 248 all out; Rajasthan 1st innings: 234 for 6 in 74 overs (Deepak Hooda 105 batting; Yash Kothari 33; Fabid Ahmed 2/37).

JAIPUR: It was tough going for Rajasthan with the bat and they needed someone who could show the way against a disciplined Pondicherry bowling line-up on Day Two.In Deepak Hooda , their captain, Rajasthan found the anchor who led them from the front with an unbeaten 105 off 171 balls to guide his team to 234/6 in 74 overs in an Elite Group B fixture of the Ranji Trophy 2024-25 at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Saturday.Laced with 12 fours, this was Hooda’s third century for Rajasthan in nine games and 12th overall. At stumps, Rajasthan were trailing by 14 runs with Manav Suthar at the other end.Resuming the day at an overnight score of 237/9, Pondicherry added 11 more runs while Ajay Rohera ran out of partners and had to miss out on his century by six runs. It was Deepak Chahar who clean bowled Abin Mathew, Pondicherry’s 10th wicket.Coming out to bat, openers Abhijeet Tomar and Yash Kothari gave Rajasthan a fine start, but eventually succumbed after chipping in with 13 off 16 balls and 33 off 58 respectively. At 66/2 in 20 overs, entered Hooda. While batsmen at the other end kept changing rather quickly, the 27-year-old did not yield to the pressure situation.What stood out in the way he achieved the three-digit mark was the skipper’s back foot shots and the ones played off the pad along with his exceptional running between the wickets to ensure the scoreboard kept ticking.Sensing his teammates' apparent struggle on a wicket where an odd ball was keeping low, experienced Hooda ensured to keep the strike as much as possible.Pondicherry spinners were at the forefront of taking the wickets. Off-spinner Fabid Ahmed and left-arm spinner Ankit Sharma took two wickets each while another left-arm spinner Sagar Udeshi and medium-pacer Gaurav Yadav bagged a wicket apiece.First hour on Day 3 will be crucial: Reflecting on the day’s play, Pondicherry new head coach Anand Rajan said that the first hour on the Day Three will be crucial. “The way we were going while batting at 145/2 on the first day, we were thinking of scoring 350, and suddenly our middle-order collapsed. But the kind of bowling attack we have, it can help us defend the score. One wicket in the morning will make a difference for a tailender will be at the crease,” said Rajan.Talking about the pitch, the Pondicherry coach said, “We thought that the pitch might turn a bit, but it hasn’t.”","Rajasthan captain Deepak Hooda hits unbeaten 105 to guide his team to 234/6 in 74 overs.

Coach Mauricio Pochettino made a successful debut in charge of the United States, leading them to a 2-0 friendly win over Panama on Saturday.Pochettino, who left Premier League side Chelsea in May after one season in charge, was appointed last month to replace Gregg Berhalter, following his dismissal after a humiliating early exit from the 2024 Copa America .The new boss spent much of the first half on the sidelines giving instructions to his team, who were unable to find the back of the net despite threatening chances, the closest coming from former Chelsea striker Christian Pulisic , whose shot after a quick breakaway was blocked by goalkeeper Orlando Mosquera.Pulisic, however, found his rhythm and showed glimpses of his scintillating start to the season with AC Milan when he delivered a fine cross for Yunus Musah to finish with aplomb four minutes after the break.Goalkeeper Matthew Turner helped the Americans maintain their advantage, denying efforts by Yoel Barcenas and Jose Rodriguez as Panama failed to equalise, and substitute Ricardo Pepi put the icing on the cake with a late goal in stoppage time.Having won his first game in charge, Pochettino will be looking to continue that streak when the U.S. travel to Guadalajara to take on Mexico on Tuesday.",Mauricio Pochettino made a successful debut in charge of the United States.

India are still without a win in 2024, Manolo Marquez is yet to taste success after three games with the national team, yet the 1-1 away draw against Vietnam in an international friendly on Saturday was one of its better games over the last year.Bui Vi Hao expectedly put Vietnam ahead after 38 minutes at the Thien Trưong Stadium in Nam Dịnh, but India fought back with a goal from Farukh Choudhary (’58) in the second session.The visitors were under pressure in the last quarter but held on for a morale boosting draw with two players -- Aakash Sangwan and Lalrinliana Hnamte – making their national team debuts.The last time both teams faced each other, India were thrashed 3-0.A major part of the credit for the draw should go to goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu . The India captain watched in disbelief as the ball hit his leg and sailed inside in the first half. But for most part, he was simply unbeatable. He proved it with multiple saves, including an early penalty, and a stunning reflex late in the game. When the ball did move past him, Anwar Ali – another impressive performer – came to the rescue with a goalline clearance towards the closing stages.Farukh, too, deserves appreciation. Left out in the cold after his last game in October 2021 for India, Manolo handpicked the Chennaiyin forward after his impressive showing in the first three games for his club in the ISL. He didn’t disappoint and was lively with his movements. The first attempt on goal came from his left foot, a powerful drive from outside the box that went straight to the keeper.Another attempt from an acute angle, after Brandon Fernandes had cleverly picked him inside the box with a no-look pass, forced a low save from the goalkeeper, using his legs.Higher-ranked and technically superior Vietnam were the better side in the first half and forced mistakes from the India defenders. The pressure finally paid off in the 38th minute, when a clearance off a Vietnam corner fell to Vi Hao, whose attempt deflected off Anwar, then Gurpreet’s leg, before rolling in, despite a desperate dive.India are not known for their comebacks, particularly when playing away, but this team hit differently in the second session. It was midfielder Suresh Singh who created the goal out of nowhere: he sent a long ball from India’s own half that evaded Vietnam captain Que Ngoc Hai and Farukh showed remarkable composure to lob the ball with his left foot, over the stranded goalkeeper.The last time Farukh scored was against Nepal in Sep 2021. A month later, he played his last international game.Vietnam had chances to register a win at a venue they have won their last two games. India’s defence at times was brittle and were saved the blushes by Gurpreet’s inspired form.Only if Liston Colaco thought and finished better, India could have killed it on the counter in stoppage time.",Bui Vi Hao expectedly put Vietnam ahead after 38 minutes.

Manolo Marquez will have to wait for his first win as India head coach as his team played out a 1-1 draw in an entertaining international football friendly match against Vietnam here on Saturday. Vietnam took the lead in the 38th minute through Nguyen Hoang Duc before Farukh Choudhary equalised in the 53rd minute at the Thien Truong Stadium , around 100 km from Hanoi.In Marquez's two matches as head coach so far, India drew against Mauritius and lost 0-3 to Syria in the Intercontinental Cup in Hyderabad last month.Ranked 116th, Vietnam are 10 spots higher than India (126th) in the FIFA rankings .In an eventful first half, India goalkeeper and captain Gurpreet Singh Sandhu stopped a penalty kick awarded to Vietnam in the 10th minute after Rahul Bheke fouled a home side attacker. Vietnam captain Que Ngoc Hai's shot, however, went straight to Sandhu.Two minutes before that, Choudhary was let free in an Indian attack but his left-footer from just outside the box was stopped by Vietnam goalie Nguyen Filip.Vietnam were on the ascendency as the match progressed and Nguyen Van Toan's shot in the 17th minute went just wide off the mark.In the 27th minute, India also got a chance but again Choudhary's left-footed shot from a difficult angle off a pass from Brandon Fernandes could not beat the Vietnam goalkeeper.Chau Ngoc Quans almost gave Vietnam the lead in the 32nd minute when he outsmarted an Indian defender with his turn and his left-footed curler beat Sandhu but the ball went wide of the post by few inches.Vietnam's goal eventually came six minutes later. Bui Vi Hao's volley from inside the box deflected from an Indian defender and Gurpreet's outstretched leg was able to touch the ball but not enough to send it out of harm's way.All Nguyen Hoang Duc had to do was just push the ball into the open net from the goal-line.India played much better in the second half. They had periods of dominance and also found the equaliser in the 53rd minute.Defender Anwar Ali sent a long aerial ball from near the centre line and Choudhary won an aerial duel with Vietnam captain Que Ngoc Hai rather easily and he chipped the ball over an onrushing goalie Nguyen Filip into the empty net.Ten minutes later, Lallianzuala Chhangte 's chip into the Vietnam box almost found Choudhary's feet but the home side goalkeeper was able to lay his hand on the ball.India called the shots in the initial period of the second half and the Blue Tigers rattled the home team's defence quite often. In the meantime, Choudhary was substituted by Edmund Lalrindika.In the 71st minute, Chhangte's shot took a deflection and went out for a corner.But from there on, Vietnam came back strongly and dictated terms in the last 15 minutes. They created a series of scoring chances but could not convert any of them.In the 79th minute, Sandhu made a brilliant reflex save to deny Van Vu's snap shot from inside the box.Three minutes later, central defender Anwar Ali made a goal-line save as he headed out a goal-bound shot.Originally, India were to play in a tri-Nation tournament but Lebanon pulled out, citing difficulties in flying out of the country due to the ongoing crisis at home. The tournament was planned in the FIFA international match window from October 7-15.India were earlier scheduled to play against Vietnam on October 9 and against Lebanon on October 12 before Lebanon's pulling out left them to play just one match.",Vietnam took the lead in the 38th minute through Nguyen Hoang Duc. Farukh Choudhary equalised in the 53rd minute at the Thien Truong Stadium.

Pellegrini sees red

A 94th-minute winner by Vangelis Pavlidis gave Greece a 2-1 victory on Thursday against England in a Nations League clash overshadowed by the death of Greek player George Baldock on the eve of the game, while Italy were held to a draw by Belgium.Greek striker Pavlidis netted a brace, either side of a late Jude Bellingham goal, to send Greece top of Group B2.Greece's first-ever victory against England came in an emotionally-charged evening at Wembley, which started with a minute's silence prior to kick-off for Baldock, an English-born Greece international who drowned in his swimming pool in Athens on Wednesday.""It was a really special day for us because of George. We are people and it's a special night because of him,"" Pavlidis told ITV.""A difficult moment for us because George was part of the team. Special guy. We have to play for him and it doesn't matter the score today. We gave everything for him.""The Greeks took a deserved lead in the 49th minute when Pavlidis danced through flimsy defending in the England box, before driving the ball past Jordan Pickford.The visitors had three disallowed goals in the match -- the last of which came just minutes before Real Madrid's Bellingham hammered in an 87th-minute equaliser for England.However, Greece were not to be denied a third win in three Nations League matches as England failed to clear the danger in their area and Pavlidis took full advantage and drilled home a late winner.In Group A2, Italy and Belgium played out an eventful 2-2 draw in Rome.The Italians raced into the lead inside 60 seconds when Andrea Cambiaso got his first international goal by bundling home from close range.Mateo Retegui doubled the hosts' lead on 24 minutes, sweeping home with his left foot after a spilled save.Italy looked comfortable and were dominating the encounter until they suffered a double blow inside the final 10 minutes of the first half.Lorenzo Pellegrini initially picked up a yellow card for his late lunge on Arthur Theate in the 38th minute but, after a VAR review, the Italy playmaker was instead shown a straight red.Belgium then duly halved the deficit from the resulting free-kick, with Maxim De Cuyper finishing emphatically from 25 yards following a clever set-piece move.Arsenal forward Leandro Trossard completed the Belgian comeback on 61 minutes.A deep corner was nodded back across goal and Trossard ghosted past the static defence to prod the ball past Gianluigi Donnarumma from close range.""There are episodes that can change a game, like their goal immediately after we went down to ten men,"" said Italy coach Luciano Spalletti.""A result doesn't always depend on the football you play and your tactics. Certainly, we could have played better in the second half after a very good first half.""Italy remain top of their group with France sitting second after they beat Israel 4-1 in Budapest.Eduardo Camavinga gave France a seventh-minute lead when the goalkeeper fumbled his tame effort, allowing the ball to bounce over the line.Omri Gandelman levelled on 24 minutes, before Christopher Nkunku restored France's advantage four minutes later with a sharp finish.As the clock wound down, the visitors added two more goals to their tally via Matteo Guendouzi and Bradley Barcola.Erling Haaland scored a brace as Norway eased past Slovenia 3-0 in Oslo to sit top of Group B3, three points ahead of Austria who beat Kazakhstan 4-0.Republic of Ireland came from behind in Helsinki to beat Finland 2-1, they sit third in Group B2 behind England.On Friday, Germany visit Bosnia and Herzegovina and Hungary host the Netherlands in Group A3, while Iceland take on Wales in Group B4.","Greece beat England 2-1 in a UEFA Nations League clash at Wembley.

Argentina were held to a 1-1 draw by Venezuela on Lionel Messi 's return as Brazil got their 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign back on track with a last-gasp 2-1 victory over Chile on Thursday.The return of Lionel Messi to Argentina's starting line-up looked to have put the world champions on the way to victory after the Inter Miami superstar's free-kick set up an opening goal for Nicolas Otamendi after 13 minutes.But a battling performance by Venezuela in front of their home fans in Maturin was rewarded midway through the second half when the 35-year-old Rondon met Yeferson Soteldo's cross with a header that flew past Argentina goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli.Despite the dropped points, 2022 World Cup winners Argentina remain firmly on course for a place at the 2026 finals, which are being staged in the United States, Canada and Mexico.With the tournament expanded to 48 teams, the top six finishers in South America's 10-team round-robin qualifying competition will earn a ticket to the finals.Argentina lead the standings with 19 points from nine games, three points clear of second-placed Colombia, who suffered a shock 1-0 defeat to Bolivia in other qualifying action on Thursday.Yet while Argentina look poised to qualify comfortably, rivals Brazil continue to make hard work of their qualifying campaign.Chile, who are one place off the bottom of the standings, rocked Brazil after just two minutes when veteran striker Eduardo Vargas steered a looping header over Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson to make it 1-0.But Brazil drew level in first-half stoppage time after Savinho worked himself into space before crossing for Botafogo forward Igor Jesus to head home.The match looked destined to finish in a draw until the 89th minute, when Brazil substitute Luiz Henrique arrowed in a low shot from the edge of the area to make it 2-1.The win moves Brazil into fourth place in the standings with 13 points from nine games, six points adrift from leaders Brazil.Bolivia recovered from the first-half dismissal of midfielder Hector Cuellar to dig out victory in a game played in the thin air of El Alto, which is situated at around 4,150m (13,600 feet) above sea level.A superb individual goal from Miguel Terceros handed the Bolivians their fourth victory of qualifying and vaulted them up into the automatic qualification positions.Bolivia's fortunes have taken a dramatic upturn since the team started playing home qualifiers in El Alto, which is just over 500m higher than the Bolivians' usual home venue of the Estadio Hernando Siles in nearby La Paz.Bolivia opted to move fixtures to El Alto after losing two out of their opening three home qualifiers in La Paz last year.The move has paid off, with Thursday's 1-0 win coming after a 4-0 rout of Venezuela at the same venue in September.After claiming a shock 2-1 win away to Chile last month, Bolivia are now sitting in fifth place in the South American standings with 12 points from nine games.Bolivia last qualified for the World Cup at the 1994 finals in the United States, and played at the 1930 and 1950 tournaments after receiving invites to compete.Terceros's winning goal arrived in the 58th minute, with the 20-year-old winger who plays for Brazilian club Santos cutting in from the right flank, shimmying past Colombian defenders Jhon Lucumi and Kevin Castano and unleashing a left-footed thunderbolt that flew into the top corner.Bolivia are level on points with Ecuador, who moved up to fourth place in the table on Thursday after a 0-0 draw with Paraguay in Quito.In Thursday's other game, struggling Chile — who are one place off the bottom of the standings with just five points from eight games — host sixth-placed Brazil.","Argentina were held to a 1-1 draw by Venezuela on Lionel Messi's return.
