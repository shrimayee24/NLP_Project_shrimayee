Undisputed WWE Championship: John Cena vs. Cody Rhodes (c)



After a thrilling night 1, WrestleMania 2 featured several high-octane matchups, including the highly anticipated headlining match, Cody Rhodes vs. John Cena , as the WWE veteran challenged Rhodes for his championship he held for a year. The night was filled with action and astonishing drama, with 63,226 in attendance as announced by Stone Cold Steve Austin. Here are the results and highlights of WrestleMania Night 2 on April 20.WrestleMania Sunday kicked off with a wild Triple Threat Match between IYO SKY, Rhea Ripley, and Bianca Belair. From the opening bell, it was nonstop chaos. Belair and Ripley initially clashed while SKY inserted herself with fast-paced offense. The crowd was red hot as each woman delivered huge moments, including Ripley’s headbutts, Belair’s signature power moves, and SKY’s high-flying attacks. Multiple near-falls kept fans on edge, and the energy built to a wild finish. After surviving a KOD, SKY landed her Over the Moonsault on Belair just in time, scoring the pin to retain the Women’s World Championship in a show-stealer.Drew McIntyre and Damian Priest went to war in a brutal Sin City Street Fight. McIntyre came out swinging before Priest battled back with weapons and hard shots outside the ring. Both men dished out punishment using chairs, steps, and tables. The chaos peaked when Priest sent McIntyre through a table with a Razor’s Edge. However, the Scottish Warrior survived and hit a DDT on the steel steps. In the final moments, Priest tried walking the ropes, but McIntyre launched him through two tables. One last Claymore, smashing Priest’s head into a wedged chair, sealed the win for McIntyre.Dominik Mysterio kicked things off with a lucha mask mishap. Once the bell rang, chaos erupted in the squared circle. Bron Breakker bulldozed through everyone, but Penta’s aerial offense kept him in the fight. Balor, Penta, and Mysterio all had their moments, with wild sequences and near falls. Carlito tried to interfere, but Breakker sent him crashing through a table. In the final stretch, Balor hit Coup de Grace on Breakker, only for Mysterio to fly in with a Frog Splash to steal the pin. In a wild and unpredictable match, Dominik walked out victorious.Randy Orton made his entrance to a thunderous roar at Allegiant Stadium. Celebrating his 20th WrestleMania, Orton vowed to deliver another RKO moment, this time against a surprise opponent, TNA World Champion Joe Hendry. The match was quick and energetic. Hendry showed off strength and charisma, even landing a fallaway slam and a kip-up. But as he celebrated, Orton struck with a sudden, picture-perfect RKO to seal the victory.AJ Styles and Logan Paul battled in a fast-paced, back-and-forth showdown. Styles came out aggressive, but Paul held his own with big moves like the Lionsault and Buckshot Lariat. Both men traded near-falls and signature finishers. Styles nearly stole it after countering Paul’s own version of the Styles Clash. In the end, interference almost tipped the scales, but Styles rejected help. Just as he tried the Phenomenal Forearm, Paul dodged and nailed him with the loaded fist before hitting the Paul-verizer for the controversial win.Becky Lynch and Liv Morgan finally clashed after nearly a year. Morgan played mind games early. Raquel Rodriguez and Morgan dominated Lyra Valkyria for most of the match, isolating her from Lynch. After a hot tag, Lynch exploded with strikes, suplexes, and a near submission before chaos broke loose. Valkyria hit a tornado DDT on Rodriguez at the ringside, and Morgan nearly stole the win with Ob-Liv-ion. But in the end, Lynch countered with a Manhandle Slam to seal the victory.John Cena's final WrestleMania was a wild ride. He battled Cody Rhodes in a grueling match filled with close calls, counters, and chaos. Rhodes kicked out of multiple AAs, and even a referee bump led to more drama. Travis Scott got involved, only to be taken out by Rhodes. When it looked like Rhodes had the upper hand, Cena delivered a low blow and leveled him with the championship belt. The ref counted three. With that, Cena made history to claim his seventeenth World Championship.Also Read: WrestleMania 41 Main Event Results: John Cena becomes the WWE World Champion for the 17th time, the Time is Now!","WrestleMania 2 featured several high-octane matchups, including the highly anticipated headlining match, Cody Rhodes vs. John Cena.

Poll How crucial was the opening partnership between Gill and Sudharsan for GT's victory? Not important at all Somewhat important Extremely crucial

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

Brief Score:

Gujarat Titans:

Kolkata Knight Riders:

Skipper Shubman Gill’s sublime 90 off 55 balls and a disciplined bowling effort powered Gujarat Titans to a convincing 39-run win over Kolkata Knight Riders at Eden Gardens on Monday. On a tacky pitch that offered little pace, Gill led from the front, crafting an elegant knock studded with 10 boundaries and three sixes.Gill was well supported by Sai Sudharsan, who continued his golden run with a composed 52 off 36 balls — his fifth fifty in six games — becoming the first player to cross 400 runs this season and reclaim the Orange Cap. Their 114-run opening partnership laid the platform for GT’s competitive 198/3, which proved more than enough on a difficult batting surface.Defending the total, Gujarat’s bowlers struck early and often. Mohammed Siraj removed Rahmanullah Gurbaz in the first over, and Rashid Khan (2/25) broke through with the key wickets of Sunil Narine and Andre Russell. The Afghan spinner looked back to his best, mixing pace and length to exploit the slow track.KKR never recovered from their poor start, slumping to 159/8. The chase lost momentum during a 36-ball stretch without a boundary as Ajinkya Rahane (50) and Venkatesh Iyer (14) struggled against GT’s spinners.Prasidh Krishna (2/25) sealed the deal with two wickets in two balls — Ramandeep Singh and Moeen Ali — in the 17th over. Washington Sundar and Sai Kishore bowled tightly in the middle overs, conceding just 55 from six combined overs.With their sixth win in eight matches, GT consolidated their position at the top of the table with 12 points, while KKR slipped further, losing their fifth match in eight games.198 for 3 in 20 overs (Shubman Gill 90, Sai Sudharsan 52; Vaibhav Arora 1/44)159/8 in 20 overs (Ajinkya Rahane 50; Prasidh Krishna 2/25, Rashid Khan 2/25)",Gujarat Titans beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 39 runs at Eden Gardens.

Bates, 68, remains a basketball legend, especially in the Philippines, where he averaged 46.2 points per game.

Inside the NBA issued an apology for falsely claiming a former player had passed away



A moment meant to celebrate NBA playoff history turned awkward on live television as TNT's Inside the NBA crew mistakenly declared that former Portland Trail Blazers standout Billy Ray Bates had passed away. The claim turned out to be completely false. Later, the Inside the NBA crew issued an apology with a corrected follow-up message. But the initial mishap was highly condemned by the fans on social media.The incident occurred during the postgame coverage of Game 1 between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat, where Ty Jerome's 28-point performance off the bench put him in elite company. The crew highlighted the most points scored in a playoff debut by a bench player, listing Ben Gordon, Malik Monk, and Billy Ray Bates. That’s when things veered off course.As the panel discussed Bates’ explosive 29-point playoff debut in 1980, Charles Barkley casually asked, “I wonder if he's still alive. This is a fair question.” The tone quickly shifted. Ernie Johnson responded firmly, “Not unless you know the answer, you do not need to ask a question like that.” The conversation escalated when Shaquille O’Neal chimed in, incorrectly asserting that Bates had passed away. “You're gonna get us fired, Chuck,” Shaq added with a laugh.The next day, Johnson delivered a heartfelt correction during TNT’s coverage of Game 2 between the New York Knicks and Detroit Pistons at Madison Square Garden. “We would like to issue a correction and an apology for something that happened last night on 'Inside the NBA,'” Johnson began. “We were talking about Billy Ray Bates… we passed on some bad information that Billy Ray Bates had passed away. While it was inadvertent, it was also inaccurate and insensitive and inexcusable. In short, we screwed up. And we apologize to Billy Ray Bates and his family.”The Pistons pulled off a gritty 100-94 win behind Cade Cunningham’s stellar 33-point outing, evening the series at 1-1. But the headlines were split between playoff basketball and the broadcast blunder involving Bates.Bates, now 68, is very much alive and still remembered for his explosive scoring, not just in the NBA but also during his dominant stretch in the Philippine Basketball Association. He averaged an astonishing 46.2 points per game across 98 PBA appearances and remains a cult hero in the Philippines.Also Read: Detroit Pistons fend off Jalen Brunson’s dominance to edge New York Knicks in NBA playoff Game 2 Though his NBA career was brief, spanning four seasons with Portland, Washington, and the Lakers, Bates left an indelible mark.

Krishna's ability to outthink batters and vary his length have been the key, as seen in his recent spell against Lucknow Super Giants when he returned with a four-wicket haul. Left-arm spinner R Sai Kishore has taken 11 wickets and could relish the variable bounce and slow nature of Eden surface.The surface at the Eden Gardens has been questioned by the KKR players. Ahead of their must-win fixtures, two pitches have been prepared for this match. One has an extra layer of grass that has not been trimmed.

John Cena’s most memorable WrestleMania matches define an entire generation of WWE. After more than two decades as the face of the company, Cena is wrapping things up at WrestleMania 41 against Cody Rhodes. It’s his final shot to claim that record-breaking 17th world title. But before we get there, let’s rewind. From epic title wins to unexpected losses, here are the WrestleMania matches that made Cena the legend he is today.Cena’s first WrestleMania match was messy, but iconic. Facing Big Show at Madison Square Garden, Cena pulled off a huge moment. Literally. He lifted the 500-pound giant onto his shoulders, dropped him with the F-U (now Attitude Adjustment), and snagged the WWE United States Championship. Sure, he used brass knuckles, but who cares? This moment marked Cena’s rise as a legit star, and it set the stage for the next decade. Not perfect wrestling, but unforgettable for Cena fans.The match wasn’t thrilling, but the outcome changed WWE history. JBL had been WWE Champion for 280 days, and the crowd hated him. Cena stepped up, and the match itself? It was short, not flashy, just straightforward. Cena hit the Attitude Adjustment, pinned JBL, and became WWE Champion for the first time. No fancy moves, no complicated spots, just Cena becoming the face of the company. This victory started the Cena era in WWE.This was Cena’s big test. Triple H, one of the greatest heels in wrestling history, had the Chicago crowd firmly on his side. Cena entered as the champion but faced a hostile arena chanting ""You can’t wrestle!"" Instead of crumbling, Cena stepped up, wrestled a solid match, and forced Triple H to tap out with the STF. Cena retained his WWE Championship and proved that he belonged in WWE’s main event scene. It wasn’t flashy, but it mattered—Cena was here to stay, and the crowd just had to deal with it.Easily Cena’s best in-ring WrestleMania match, and it’s all thanks to Shawn Michaels. Known as ""Mr. WrestleMania,"" Michaels pulled the best out of Cena. They wrestled for nearly half an hour, zero fluff, just pure wrestling and storytelling. Cena locked in the STF again, forcing Michaels to submit. Fans may not have liked Cena, but after this match, they had to respect him. It was Cena at his wrestling peak—no nonsense, no controversy, just the best match of his career.Cena versus The Rock felt unreal, even though it had been hyped for an entire year. The Rock, returning to his hometown Miami, hadn’t wrestled a singles match in nearly a decade. Cena was WWE’s full-time megastar. The atmosphere was unmatched—fans divided, noise off the charts. The match delivered huge spots, both stars trading finishers, until Cena got cocky and attempted a mocking People’s Elbow. Rock caught him, nailed a Rock Bottom, and Cena lost clean. It was Cena’s biggest loss, shocking everyone who expected WWE’s poster boy to win. Sure, they did a rematch the next year, but nothing topped this night—when Cena, for once, was truly humbled.Cena’s WrestleMania legacy is a wild ride. Wins, losses, unforgettable moments. Love him or hate him, these matches made Cena the defining WWE superstar of his era. Now, let’s see if he has one more legendary moment left at WrestleMania 41.","John Cena is wrapping things up at WrestleMania 41 against Cody Rhodes.

Poll Who has the better chance of qualifying for the playoffs? Both teams equally SRH CSK

MS Dhoni's shrewd captaincy has helped CSK bounce back from the worst situations, enabling them to pull off improbable comebacks. Fans expected a similar turnaround for the franchise following the wicketkeeper-batter's return to captaincy after CSK captain Ruturaj Gaikwad got sidelined due to an injury.Also See: IPL Live Score, KKR vs GT However, things have gone from bad to worse for CSK despite Dhoni being the captain, as evident from the team's performances against KKR and MI. The Chennai-based franchise managed to score just 103 runs against the Ajinkya Rahane-led side, suffering a defeat by eight wickets. Fierce rivals MI also pulled off a dominant nine-wicket win as Dhoni watched on silently.CSK are currently at the bottom of the IPL 2025 points table following six defeats in eight matches with a NRR of -1.392.It has been a similar state of affairs for SRH who are currently ninth on the points table after losing five out of seven matches so far this season. The Hyderabad-based franchise has a NRR of -1.217. SRH started the season off strongly, smashing 286 in their opener against RR.However, they failed to maintain the same momentum, recording defeats at regular intervals from that point. Ishan Kishan's form has been a major concern while the bowlers have also struggled to make their presence felt. Even Travis Head has been quite subdued in comparison to IPL 2024.How can CSK qualify for playoffs?CSK will need to win all six remaining matches comfortably in order to stand a chance of making it to the playoffs. The Chennai-based franchise currently has four points, while the top five teams already have 10 points in their kitty.CSK currently have the worst NRR in IPL 2025 which makes the task even tougher for the side.

From gridiron greatness to emotional vulnerability



When public image collides with private battles



Even the most successful athletes face challenges that stats and accolades can’t capture—and Tom Brady is no exception. Widely regarded as the greatest quarterback in NFL history , Brady's legendary career boasts an unmatched seven Super Bowl titles, yet behind the shine of championship rings lies a more vulnerable, human side he’s beginning to share with the world.For two decades, Tom Brady maintained a laser focus on football, becoming the ultimate symbol of discipline and competitive excellence. But recently, the 46-year-old has revealed glimpses of his personal struggles, particularly in the wake of his divorce from supermodel Gisele Bündchen . Brady, who is usually tight-lipped about his private life, opened up about the emotional toll of navigating heartbreak, admitting he’s dealt with moments of “willful blindness.”This phrase—suggesting a conscious decision to ignore uncomfortable truths—points to the complexities Brady faced in his marriage’s unraveling. While he didn’t name names, the context was unmistakable, especially given recent headlines surrounding Bündchen's ongoing relationship with her jiu-jitsu trainer, who is now widely rumored to be her partner and the father figure in her children’s lives.“Willful blindness” is not just a phrase—it’s a powerful acknowledgment of emotional compromise. Tom Brady’s reflection reveals the cost of chasing perfection on the field while personal issues simmer in the background. The quarterback, once seemingly invincible both in his career and family life, now speaks like someone reckoning with the pain of being left behind. For fans, it’s a rare and raw admission: the GOAT is still just a man.The emotional fallout of watching Gisele Bündchen move on publicly is undoubtedly difficult for someone so accustomed to control and success. Reports of her being seen with her new partner and children add emotional weight to Brady’s recent comments, suggesting a sense of betrayal or at least loss.Also Read: Fresh discussion on Tom Brady and Gisele’s Bündchen’s marriage reignites debate over missed red flags Brady’s recent openness signals a shift—not just for him but for the culture surrounding sports icons.

After an enthralling start to the grandest stage of WWE on night one of Wrestlemania 41, night 2 of the yearly spectacle offered a few more earth-shattering surprises and mouth watering contests. A plethora of Championships changed hands and several legends stopped by to entertain the audience in attendance at the Allegiant stadium in Paradise, Nevada.The Scottish Warrior Drew McIntyre faced Damian Priest in a fearsome “Sin city Street fight”. A whole heap of weapons such as tables, chairs, and steps were used between the two towering superstars. First, Priest used his “Razors Edge” move on McIntyre to send him through a table, and then McIntyre hit his signature DDT on the steel steps to Priest. But after a couple of “Claymore’s”, McIntyre pushed Priest’s head into a wedged chair to defeat the “Archer of Infamy” and register a big win.The trio of Bianca Belair, Rhea Ripley, and Iyo Sky went toe to toe, to decide the Women’s World Champion in a highly fast- paced match, which just kept improving until the finish. In the kickoff match of Wrestlemania night two, some chaos of the highest quality was delivered by the three women superstars of WWE. After some magnificent high-flying moves from Sky, Rhea Ripley’s brutal head-butts, and Bianca’s power moves, it was Sky, who came out trumps between the three. Sky hit her signature “Over the Moonsault” on Belair and secured the pin fall to retain her Women’s World Championship in a humdinger of a match.“Dirty” Dominik Mysterio, squared off against Bron Breakker, Finn Balor and Peta in a “Fatal 4 way” match for the coveted title. Although the odds were heavily stacked in favour of Ballor and Dominik, as they are a team, at first it looked like it was Breakker, who was going to retain his Championship. But, after a highly unpredictable encounter, it was Dominik who became the new Intercontinental Champion, by delivering his signature “Frog Splash” on Breakker to win his first major singles Championship in WWE.After going at each other for the last couple of weeks, AJ Styles and Logan Paul squared off against each other in a highly entertaining contest. Although Styles came out ultra-aggressively, Paul had plans of his own to encounter the “Phenomenal One”. After a lot of near falls and close shaves, It was Paul who dodged the “Phenomenal Forearm” from Styles and hit him with his notorious “Loaded Fist”, and then the “Paul-veriser” to seal a famous victory at Wrestlemania 41, night 2.In a pleasant surprise to the audience present in the arena and the whole world, it was Becky Lynch who came out as Lyra Valkyria’s partner to square off against the duo of Raquel Rodriguez and Liv Morgan, for the Women’s tag team Championship. Notably, it was Morgan who Becky had last faced before going on a hiatus from WWE. After a mesmerising contest, and Valkyria taking Rodriguez out at the ringside, it was Becky, who hit her “Manhandle” slam on Morgan to seal the victory and secure her first Women’s tag team Championship.Randy Orton defeated his mystery partner(Joe Hendry) in a highly entertaining match. As Orton was searching for his opponent in his 20th Wrestlemania appearance, TNA World Champion, Joe Hendry’s, famous music hit and he came out to a huge roar from the audience, to challenge the “Viper”. Randy hit him with his famous RKO twice and secured the victory on Joe.In the most awaited encounter of the year, John Cena, who was wrestling in his last Wrestlemania squared off against WWE Champion Cody Rhodes in a brutal contest. After multiple finishers and a lot of near falls, superstar Travis Scott came out to help Cena. Although Cody encountered this interference perfectly and delivered a brutal “Crossroads” to Travis, fate had other ideas. In the end, Cena cheated his way to hit a brutal low -blow to Rhodes and then hit him with the Championship belt on the head to secure the victory. This was Cena’s 17th World Title win, which makes him the record holder for the highest number of World Championships in WWE History.","Wrestlemania 41, night 2, offered a few more surprises and mouth watering contests.

Toronto Maple Leafs goalie Anthony Stolarz is moving into the limelight, and not without provocation. On the eve of a crucial game, Don Cherry, the long-time NHL color commentator famous for his blunt observations, made a divisive prediction about the 30-year-old goalie.

He seems sure that the Toronto Maple Leafs have every right to believe in Anthony Stolarz between the pipes.Don Cherry, a fellow who gained recognition for his in-your-face hockey commentary , never hesitated to speak his mind. On his podcast, he pointed out the statistics: Ottawa Senators scored on the Toronto Maple Leafs 9-3 in their games this season, and the Maple Leafs were unable to score with a single power play against them. And yet, he thinks Stolarz is the man — but with a condition.""Well, he's the guy that should start. He should start,"" Don Cherry said. ""He might be their ace in the hole. He'll either be good or he'll be really bad.""This is nothing new to Anthony Stolarz, who has had a bumpy NHL path since he was 45th overall in 2012 by the Philadelphia Flyers. With a brief foray into college hockey, Anthony Stolarz set himself apart with the London Knights, building a foundation for a professional career that has required toughness at every turn. From spells with the Edmonton Oilers and the Anaheim Ducks, the goalkeeper now has the opportunity to justify himself for the Toronto Maple Leafs.Now the Maple Leafs are counting on that experience paying off in clutch performances.

Kylie Kelce defends her unusual parenting choice with Jason — and people are talking about it



Kylie on Ziplining in Stadiums, NFL Group Chats & Egg Freezing Reality with Kaylee Hartung | Ep. 19

Kylie Kelce is not just adjusting to life as a mother of four—she's embracing it with honesty, humor, and a whole lot of heart. In the latest episode of her podcast Not Gonna Lie , the 33-year-old gave fans a candid look into the realities of parenting with her husband, former NFL center Jason Kelce, after welcoming their newest family member, Finnley Anne, on March 30.While many might assume that a four-child household runs on chaos, Kylie Kelce and Jason have crafted a routine that works uniquely well for them. And it’s Kylie who takes the lead when it comes to those dreaded overnight wake-ups. “Overnights with a newborn for us typically mean that I’m waking up and doing feeds and Jason is sleeping, so that he can man the toddlers during the day,” she shared in the pre-recorded April 17 episode of her podcast. “That’s how I like it.”This isn’t about conforming to outdated gender roles. Kylie made it clear that the decision was rooted in practicality, not tradition. “This is not like a decision making, ‘Oh, let the man sleep.’ No. He needs sleep to be able to chase toddlers during the day, so that I can continue to sit with a child,” she added.Their parenting strategy might be unconventional to some, but in a home filled with the pitter-patter (and occasional stomp) of four little girls—Wyatt (5), Elliotte (4), Bennett (2), and newborn Finn—it’s all about balance. Kylie, who announced her pregnancy with Finn back in November, has always been open about the highs and lows of motherhood, and this episode was no different.She recounted those initial moments of becoming a mother with her firstborn, Wyatt. “We left the hospital and I was like, ‘So you’re telling me this is mine?’” Kylie said, capturing the sense of awe and disbelief many new parents feel. The turning point, she shared, came when Wyatt first smiled with intention. “Because it showed that there was a connection. Before that, I felt like I was just a sleep-deprived stranger trying to keep this tiny human alive.”What makes Kylie’s narrative so refreshing is her willingness to shine a light on the challenges many mothers face but few talk about openly. “The conversations we’re not having are the things we’re all experiencing—postpartum depression, baby blues, mom guilt, feeling inadequate as a woman. We all go through it, but nobody talks about it. And we should,” she said with heartfelt honesty.In addition to navigating life with a newborn, the Kelces are also witnessing their older daughters adapt to the new family dynamic. Kylie revealed that each child has handled the arrival of baby Finn in her own unique way. “Bennett is still ticked. She is annoyed. She told me, ‘Put baby down,’” Kylie said, laughing. “Wyatt is very excited. She keeps walking by and going, ‘Oh my gosh. She’s just so cute.’” Meanwhile, 4-year-old Elliotte—or Ellie—has her own funny obsession: “Can I touch your piggies?” she repeatedly asks, referring to her baby sister’s tiny toes, even during nap time.Jason Kelce, who retired from professional football in March 2024 after a storied career with the Philadelphia Eagles, may no longer be on the field, but he's fully in the game as a hands-on dad. Kylie has spoken warmly about his commitment to both family and the city they call home. “He gave his blood, sweat, and tears to the city, and it was out of sheer love and commitment. And I hope that my girls see that,” she told Today.The Kelce household may be bustling, sleepless, and sprinkled with toddler meltdowns, but it's also a testament to teamwork, love, and shared responsibility. With Kylie’s unfiltered perspective and Jason’s all-in parenting style, this couple continues to inspire by showing that even in the midst of chaos, connection and care can thrive.And as for baby Finn? She's already surrounded by love—whether she’s awake or simply trying to nap while her sisters fight over her piggies.Also Read: From Hollywood sweetheart to controversy magnet: Has Josh Allen's fiance Hailee Steinfeld’s public image taken a hit in 2025?","Kylie Kelce gave fans a candid look into the realities of parenting with her husband, former NFL center Jason Kelce.

McDavid has contributed a further 100 to keep the side interested despite a poor season overall. With the addition of several influential players such as Evan Bouchard and Zach Hyman to the already very competitive lineup of Edmonton, the Oilers are not a team to take lightly, although several questions are raised by muted injury trouble and inconsistent away showings.Stuart Skinner, the goaltender, has to be focused. His season has been a mix of the ups and down, but Skinner historically has been very solid against the Kings, having recorded a .941 save percentage. However, the Kings roster worth has further elevated, thanks to Adrian Kempe, Anze Kopitar, and Kevin Fiala; all three players have contributed to the high output of offense in Los Angeles.Darcy Kuemper's return to form this season is what makes the Kings especially tough at home. He has a 2.02 goals-against average, supported by a strong 31-win season, and made the Kings a fortress at home by going 31-6-4. His stats against the Oilers add more strength to the argument, bringing a clear advantage in the goaltending department for Los Angeles.In fact, the Kings are favored by odds slightly, and with the added advantage of playing at home, along with the momentum they have been enjoying, the prediction opinion of the crowd would most likely sway toward a close but favorable outcome for Los Angeles.Also Read : Connor McDavid suffered from a lower-body injury, and Leon Draisaitl suffered from an undisclosed injuryGame 1 would see the Edmonton Oilers up against the Los Angeles Kings in a series that has all the makings of being fiercely contested. Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl bring playoff experience to the table; however, that would have to be weighed against the home dominance for the Kings and the current form of Kuemper. One could expect a hard-fought opener with playoff intensity from the very first puck drop.","Edmonton Oilers take on the Los Angeles Kings in the first round of the NHL playoffs.

The New York Jets keep Sauce Gardner, Garrett Wilson, and Jermaine Johnson II, but don’t mention Breece Hall

Two weeks back, Aaron Glenn said that the New York Jets would utilize three RBs as much as they could - Breece Hall, Braelon Allen, and Isaiah Davis

Sauce Gardner, Garrett Wilson, and Jermaine Johnson II would be with the New York Jets for two more years

According to NHL Insider, Ian Rapoport’s X post, New York Jets general manager Darren Mougey told reporters that the team would exercise fifth-year options on 2022 first-round draft picks - Sauce Gardner , Garrett Wilson , and Jermaine Johnson II . An X user reacted, “Might as well!” Another wrote, “.......and Breece?” Breece Hall had been with the New York Jets since the 2022 NFL draft but was a second-round, 36th overall pick! No wonder all fans want Breece Hall to extend his stay with the New York Jets.According to NHL Insider Adam Schefter, the New York Jets are picking up the fifth-year options on each of their 2022 first-round picks, cornerback Sauce Gardner ($20.1 million base salary in 2026), wide receiver Garrett Wilson ($16.8 million base salary in 2026), and defensive end Jermaine Johnson II ($13.4 million base salary in 2026). But there was no mention of Breece Hall, the running back of the New York Jets, who is also on his fifth-year option! Just that Breece Hall was a second-round and 36th-overall pick.Aaron Glenn, the first-time head coach for the New York Jets, talked about Breece Hall with Rich Cimini of ESPN. Glenn said, “I think mentally, (Breece Hall) is in a good place, but I would say that we have three running backs on this team that we are going to utilize as much as possible. They are all big men. They can run. They are violent. They are physical. So I think, once we get a chance to get the platters in and see exactly how they operate, I think every player is going to be happy with the way that we go about this offense, and I think he’s going to be one of them.”The three running backs preferred by Aaron Glenn are Breece Hall, Braelon Allen, and Isaiah Davis. But this news was shared on April 7, 2025, by Kevin Patra, Senior News Writer of NFL.com. It’s been more than 2 weeks, and there’s still no confirmation on Breece Hall’s extension, but there’s confirmation on Sauce Gardner, Garrett Wilson, and Jermaine Johnson II. An X user rightly expressed, “No Breece that’s disrespectful.”23-year-old Breece Hall accumulated 2,333 rushing yards, 4.6 rushing average, 14 rushing TDs, 152 receptions, 1,292 receiving yards, and 8 receiving TDs over 40 games in 3 NFL seasons playing for the New York Jets.According to Michael David Smith of Pro Football Talk, the New York Jets will likely try to negotiate long-term contract extensions with Sauce Gardner, Garrett Wilson, and Jermaine Johnson II. But even without any additional negotiations, they will all be with the New York Jets for two more years.24-year-old Sauce Gardner accumulated 181 tackles, 40 passes defensed, 3 interceptions, 2 QB hits, 1 sack, and 1 forced fumble over 48 NFL games in a total of 3 NFL seasons playing for the New York Jets.24-year-old Garrett Wilson accumulated 279 passes for 3,249 yards and 14 TDs over 51 NFL games playing for the New York Jets.

Rey Mysterio’s injury report

Roman Reigns left heartbroken after WrestleMania betrayal

WrestleMania 41 was packed with jaw-dropping action, betrayals, and title changes across both nights at Allegiant Stadium. While fans witnessed several unforgettable moments inside the ring, the aftermath of the grand spectacle has proven just as intense. From Rey Mysterio’s unfortunate injury to Roman Reigns’ emotional breakdown following Paul Heyman’s shocking betrayal, here’s a rundown of the most talked-about post-WrestleMania developments. WWE legend Rey Mysterio was originally scheduled to compete on Night 1 of WrestleMania 41, but was forced to pull out due to a serious groin injury. According to reports by Wrestling Observer Radio, Mysterio suffered the injury during a recent episode of SmackDown. While early speculation pointed to a possible knee issue, it was later confirmed to be a groin tear.The masked veteran had initially hoped to tough it out and make his appearance at WrestleMania, but medical evaluations ruled him out. His determination to perform despite the injury reflects his fighting spirit, but ultimately, WWE officials made the call to prioritize his health.In Mysterio’s absence, SmackDown’s newest signee Rey Fenix stepped in to face El Grande Americano, making a surprise debut on the grandest stage. Although the result sparked controversy, it marked a significant moment in Fenix’s budding WWE career.As for Mysterio, early estimates suggest he could be sidelined for four months or more, depending on the severity of the tear. WWE has yet to issue an official recovery timeline, but the absence of the Hall of Famer will be deeply felt.The emotional fallout from WrestleMania was perhaps most evident in the reaction of Roman Reigns.

Pune: Divya Deshmukh , 19, showed her confidence and scored an exciting win over Batkhuyag Munguntuul of Mongolia who is twice her age in the seventh round of Women’s FIDE Grand Prix on Monday.Divya’s fourth win in the tournament took her to five points with just two rounds to go. When she came for an official interaction with FIDE, she felt that the K Humpy vs Zhu Jiner game was heading towards a draw.But there was drama in store as the Chinese blundered on the 44th move — Qxb4 (taking pawn) — in the queen, pawns, double knight vs Humpy’s queen, pawns, double bishop. The 22-year-old lost her knight in the process. The 38-year-old Indian veteran, who is known for her stability, needed only 11 more moves to force the resignation on Monday.Humpy is now the sole leader of the tournament with 5.5 points. Tuesday’s game between joint second placed Zhu and Divya, is expected to have a decisive bearing on the tournament’s final standings.Divya said, “I have lost to her twice but there is always time to turn it around.” It was Humpy’s first classical win over the Chinese. She had lost to Zhu (Elo 2525) at FIDE GP in 2023. “I was surprised by the opponent’s choice of Queens Indian defence. I got the tempo later on but 24.Qf5 was probably not required as I was oversmart,” she said.","Divya’s fourth win in the tournament took her to five points with just two rounds to go.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

1860 Munich today: up for sale?

The legendary German football coach Werner Lorant passed away aged 76 on Sunday, his family and former club, TSV 1860 Munich , confirmed.As a player in the 1970s and 1980s, Lorant represented Borussia Dortmund, Rot-Weiss Essen, 1. FC Saarbrücken, Hannover 96, Schalke 04 and Eintracht Frankfurt, winning the German Cup and UEFA Cup with the latter.But it was as the long-serving head coach of 1860 Munich between 1992 and 2001 that Lorant really made his name, leading Die Löwen (the lions) from the third division to the Bundesliga.His greatest achievement was the team finishing fourth in 2000. This position in the Bundesliga saw 1860 enter the Champions League qualification play-off round — where they lost to English Premier League side Leeds United.The German club confirmed Lorant's death following a long illness on Sunday, describing him as ""one of the most successful coaches in the club's 125-year history.""""Football meant the world to him,"" his sister told 1860 fan website dieblaue24, who first reported the news. ""When he no longer had football, he was no longer well. He loved Die Löwen. They were close to his heart.""During his coaching career, Lorant developed a reputation for no-nonsense management.Asked once by a journalist why he hadn't substituted a clearly injured player despite being 5-1 up against Nuremberg, he replied: ""Players are only subbed if their leg falls off.""After being sent to the stands during an away game against Werder Bremen for insulting the referee, he then said the official ""can be happy that I didn't slap him"" — earning himself a fine of 8,000 marks (around €4,000 or $4,560).Later in his career, he wasn't a fan of new technology and banned his players from using mobile phones, saying: ""If a phone goes off [on the team bus], they can get off and use the phone to call a taxi.""His general motto as a coach was: ""Everyone is entitled to an opinion — but only mine counts.""Nowadays, 1860 Munich – Bayern Munich's city rivals – are marooned in the third division again, having been forcibly relegated to the fourth tier in 2017 as a result of a complicated relationship with a controversial investor.Jordanian billionaire Hasan Ismaik purchased a 60% stake in the club in 2011, helping to save it from insolvency, but he failed to understand that German football's 50+1 ownership rule prevented him from actually exercising majority control.Following relegation to the third division in 2017, Ismaik effectively attempted to blackmail the club, withholding the necessary funding for a league license unless he was given full control — something the club were neither wiling nor legally able to do. Consequently, 1860 were automatically relegated to division four, before fighting their way back up.But the relationship with Ismaik has remained strained — until he announced last Sunday that he would finally be interested in selling his stake in the club.""I think 1860 needs someone new, they don't need Hasan,"" he told German public broadcaster ARD, referring to himself in the third person. ""I want to sell the club and just be an 1860 fan.""","Werner Lorant has died aged 76, his former club TSV 1860 Munich has confirmed. Lorant was head coach of the German club between 1992 and 2001. He led Die Löwen (the lions) from the third division to the Bundesliga in 2000.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120484138,imgsize-1070969,width-400,resizemode-4/Photo-shared-by-Bayern-Munich-on-X.jpg"

Barwal claims meet record

Kochi: Pranav Pramod Gurav emerged as the surprise package on the opening day of the 28th National Federation Senior Athletics Competition at the Maharaja’s College ground on Monday.Representing the Railways, the 23-year-old from Maharashtra not only outperformed more established sprinters but also overcame sweltering weather conditions to become the fastest athlete of the four-day meet. His time of 10.27 seconds, a personal best, placed him ahead of Animesh Kujur (10.32s) and Manikanta Hoblidhar (10.35s).National 100m record holder Gurindervir Singh delivered an underwhelming performance, finishing last in the final with a time of 11.21 seconds. It seemed that Gurindervir couldn’t run properly as he felt cramps in his thighs at the start of the race.The opening day proved particularly demanding for the sprinters, who were forced to run the heats, semifinals and final of the 100m on Monday itself as the organisers decided to complete the event in a day. “I never ran three races in a single day in my career. This was hectic,” said Animesh.In the women’s 100m dash, Telengana’s Nithya Gandhe secured a comfortable victory, clocking 11.50 seconds. Tamil Nadu’s Abhinaya Rajarajan (11.54s) and Karnataka’s Sneha SS (11.62s) secured second and third positions respectively.Sawan Barwal from the Indian Army established a meet record in the men’s 10,000m race, clocking 28.57.13s to secure the gold medal.His performance surpassed the previous record of 28.57.90s, which was set by Surendra Singh in 2007. The Indian contingent for the Asian Athletics Championships , scheduled to be held in South Korea next month, will be picked following this meet, and on Day 1, five athletes achieved the qualification benchmark of the Asian meet.These athletes included Barwal and Abhishek Pal in men’s 10,000m, Lili Das and Pooja in the women’s 1500m and Yoonus Shah in men’s 1500m. However, the day’s spotlight was firmly on Gurav as he came up with a result beyond his own expectations. He dedicated his win to his ailing grandfather, who is currently hospitalised.","Pranav Pramod Gurav wins 100m in 10.27 seconds. Indian Army'sawan Barwal sets meet record in men's 10,000m race.

Rishabh Pant-led Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) will lock horns against Axar Patel 's Delhi Capitals (DC) in match No 40 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow.With five wins in seven games, DC are placed at the second place on the points table, whereas LSG are at fifth position with 10 points in eight games.For Lucknow the poor form of their captain Rishabh Pant is a big worry. He has merely 106 runs from eight games and 63 of those came in a single match. His strike-rate of 98 is also a tad worrisome.On the other hand, Axar too will have some concerns about their skipper -- Axar Patel. Axar has led well and made 140 runs at a strike-rate of 159, but those improvements have masked his diminishing returns as a bowler -- just a solitary wicket from seven matches at an economy of 9.36.This season, LSG have played four matches at home, two each on black and red soil surfaces, respectively. The black soil pitches have favoured the team’s strengths and brought two victories, while the team has lost both matches played on the red soil pitch, which will be used for Tuesday’s game. Rishabh Pant and Co. will be keeping their fingers crossed heading into this one.LSG predicted XI: Aiden Markram, Mitchell Marsh, Nicholas Pooran, Rishabh Pant (c & wk), Ayush Badoni, David Miller, Abdul Samad, Shardul Thakur, Avesh Khan, Ravi Bishnoi, Prince YadavDigvesh RathiAbhishek Porel, KL Rahul (wk), Karun Nair, Axar Patel (c), Tristan Stubbs, Ashutosh Sharma, Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Mukesh KumarDonovan FerreiraAccuWeather forecasts a temperature drop from 36°C at the start of the match to 29°C by the end, with no rain expected.Catch the match between LSG vs DC on the Star Sports Network on TV, with livestreaming available on JioHotstar from 7:30 PM IST onwards.Rishabh Pant (wk/captain), Aiden Markram, Mitchell Marsh, Nicholas Pooran, Ayush Badoni, Abdul Samad, David Miller, Shardul Thakur, Avesh Khan, Akash Deep, Digvesh Singh Rathi, Ravi Bishnoi, Prince Yadav, Shahbaz Ahmed, Matthew Breetzke, Himmat Singh, Shamar Joseph, Manimaran Siddharth, Aryan Juyal, RS Hangargekar, Yuvraj Chaudhary, Akash Maharaj Singh, Mayank Yadav, Arshin Kulkarni.Axar Patel (c), Jake Fraser-McGurk, Abishek Porel, Karun Nair, KL Rahul(w), Tristan Stubbs, Ashutosh Sharma, Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Mukesh Kumar, Sameer Rizvi, Darshan Nalkande, Donovan Ferreira, Tripurana Vijay, Dushmantha Chameera, Faf du Plessis, T Natarajan, Ajay Jadav Mandal, Manvanth Kumar L, Madhav Tiwari.","Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) take on Delhi Capitals (DC) in match No 40 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

NEW DELHI: A commanding 114-run opening stand between skipper Shubman Gill and Sai Sudharsan on a sluggish Eden Gardens surface proved decisive as Gujarat Titans outclassed Kolkata Knight Riders by 39 runs in their IPL clash on Monday.Sent in to bat on a pitch described as “really slow” by both captains, Gill and Sudharsan played with patience and precision, blunting any early advantage KKR hoped to gain after opting to bowl. The Titans posted a competitive 198/3, hitting just five sixes in their innings but making smart use of gaps and strike rotation.Gill, who looked set for his first hundred of the season, fell for a sublime 90 off 55 balls (10 fours, 3 sixes), while Sudharsan continued his consistent form with 52 off 36. Jos Buttler, fresh from his last match heroics, remained unbeaten on 41 from 23 balls, surprisingly not hitting a single six but crunching eight boundaries.The target of 199 proved well beyond KKR’s reach as they were restricted to 159/8. The loss was their fifth in eight matches, leaving them languishing in seventh place. Titans, meanwhile, stayed at the top with 12 points from eight games. Ajinkya Rahane , leading KKR, top-scored with 50 off 36 but lacked support. Rahmanullah Gurbaz fell in the opening over to Mohammed Siraj, and the hosts never recovered. GT’s spinners then tightened the screws — Rashid Khan (2/25), Sai Kishore (1/19), and Washington Sundar (1/36) all struck at key intervals.Post-match, Rahane acknowledged the Titans’ strong start. “I thought 199 was chaseable. We came back into the game well with the ball, but our batting let us down again. We’ve struggled to get solid starts, and that’s something we need to improve quickly,” he said.He added, “The pitch was slow, but 200 was still gettable. It’s about being brave with the bat — you can’t think about getting out. We need to back ourselves, especially in the middle overs.”Purple Cap holder Prasidh Krishna (2/25) and veteran Ishant Sharma (1/18) ensured KKR had no late surge, sealing another clinical win for the Titans.","Gujarat Titans beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 39 runs in IPL clash.

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

Poll Should Rohit Sharma continue as captain of the Indian cricket team? No, it's time for a change. Yes, he should continue.

IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma has had a terrible time with the bat in whites

Australian cricket legend Steve Waugh has advised Indian captain Rohit Sharma to reflect on his future in cricket, particularly regarding his leadership role ahead of India's upcoming Test series against England in June. Waugh emphasised that Rohit, who turns 38 this month, must make his own decision about continuing as captain while also expressing concerns about protecting Test cricket amid the growing popularity of T20 leagues .Waugh believes the decision about leading India must come from Rohit himself, especially considering his recent performance struggles.""It is totally up to him. He is the only one who can solve that problem. He has got to look himself in the mirror and say, do I still want to be captain or play for India? Am I committed?"" Waugh, a member of the Laureus World Sports Academy , said.""Am I putting enough time and effort into it? It is a privilege and an honour to play for your country. You can't be complacent or relax,"" he added.Rohit's recent form has been concerning, with poor performances in Test series against Bangladesh, New Zealand, and Australia. He notably opted out of the Sydney Test due to poor form during India's 1-3 series loss earlier this year in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Waugh also addressed the future of Test cricket, stressing on its importance despite T20's rising popularity.""There is stress on Test cricket, whether it will survive because we need it as a sport. T20 cricket is amazing, great for players and spectators and great for sponsors but I still think Test cricket is the very essence of cricket. The players I believe still want to play Tests to see how good they can actually be. It's the ultimate contest. Making sure that it survives and thrives and is healthy is really important,"" Waugh explained.Regarding criticism about South Africa's World Test Championship qualification despite playing fewer matches, Waugh defended the current system.""There's always complaints. In Champions Trophy, India played a neutral ground in Dubai and people complained about that. You have to do what you can to make things happen. It's not a perfect situation. Some countries play a lot of Test matches, some don't play many. South Africa probably didn't play as many as other countries. They were pretty successful in what they did. I believe the two best Test playing countries are lining up in the final,"" he stated.Waugh opposed the proposed two-tier system for Test cricket.""I don't like two tier, It weakens whoever's in the second tier not playing vs strong sides, they're not going to be able to improve and get better. The top sides will keep getting better and stronger and it'll just separate world cricket into teams that are top level and other teams that are okay and we want to develop the other teams right now,"" he remarked.""Test cricket is pretty strong actually, it's probably seven or eight sides capable of beating each other and that hasn't been the case for few years so I actually think Test cricket is going okay right now,"" Waugh said.On the suggestion of bonus points for away wins in the 2025-27 WTC cycle, Waugh disagreed.""That's all subjective. How do you say who's a stronger team? I think the current system is pretty good. At end of the day, you've got to be consistent, you've got to win both away and at home,"" he commented.","Australian cricket legend Steve Waugh has advised Indian captain Rohit Sharma to reflect on his future in cricket.
