NEW DELHI: Drama erupted in the third over of the Sunrisers Hyderabad–Mumbai Indians IPL clash when Ishan Kishan ’s dismissal triggered an unusual chain of events and a flood of online reaction.Facing Deepak Chahar , Kishan appeared to feather a leg‑side delivery to wicketkeeper Ryan Rickelton.The on‑field umpire hesitated, then raised the finger.Kishan did not consult with his partner; convinced he was out, he walked. Mumbai offered only a muted appeal, yet the umpire’s decision stood.Moments later, the replay package told a different story: Snicko registered no spike, suggesting there was no contact between bat and ball. Social media lit up.Former India batter Navjot Singh Sidhu wrote, “Buying trouble is as easy as pie, but the carrying charges are high—ever seen an umpire give one without an appeal?”Commentator Harsha Bhogle admitted the sequence left him “perplexed.”Kishan’s exit for one run left Sunrisers tottering at 9/2 after 2.1 overs, part of an early collapse that saw them slump to 35/5.Trent Boult (4/26) and Deepak Chahar (2/12) shared the damage before Heinrich Klaasen and Abhinav Manohar rescued the innings.Their 99‑run stand lifted SRH to 143 for eight, with Klaasen cracking 71 from 44 and Manohar 43 from 27. Klaasen’s dismissal gave Jasprit Bumrah his 300th wicket in senior T20 cricket.The match began with both teams wearing black armbands to honour victims of the Pahalgam terror attack.Mumbai captain Hardik Pandya chose to bowl after winning the toss, and Boult struck first by removing Travis Head for a duck. Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy and Aniket Verma followed quickly.Klaasen counter‑punched, reaching fifty in 34 balls and accelerating in the final five overs, which yielded 53 runs.Boult cleaned up Pat Cummins with the last ball to close the innings.","Ishan Kishan dismissed in third over of Sunrisers Hyderabad–Mumbai Indians IPL clash.

Boston Bruins eye new additions and a defensive core around the rebuild

After a season full of poor form and health issues, and shocking key roster changes, the Boston Bruins made a pretty strong decision to hit reset. Jacobs, hopefully, in charge of the last-place party in the Atlantic Division, has given a future promise to this franchise, indicating a return to postseason contention by 2026. Much is expected from the coming offseason as the team executives prepare for retooling the lineup, a new head coach, and roster reinforcement. A very crucial rebuilding stage has commenced in Boston.The 2024-25 season was a disaster for the Bruins, with the lowest standings points percentage in almost two decades. In the first 20 games, the front office fired head coach Jim Montgomery before trading away franchise veterans like Brad Marchand, Charlie Coyle , and Brandon Carlo. The dust has now settled, and General Manager Don Sweeney made it clear- this was the first step in a focus on building a team meant to reclaim Boston's hard-nosed identity.Increased offensive production has become a dire need of the Bruins, especially on the wings; the team's final ranking in the number of goals scored per game placed them 28th in the league, despite David Pastrnak's remarkable performance with a total of 43 goals in the season. Defensive discipline has been a hallmark of Bruins hockey, but this, too, did not seem quite right, with goaltenders Jeremy Swayman and Joonas Korpisalo both underperforming.Health will be a major factor in this charge. Most of the rhythm of the entire team was affected throughout the season because of the injured critical defensemen, Charlie McAvoy and Hampus Lindholm. Sweeney and President Cam Neely contemplate that a healthy core combined with offseason additions could see the team return to considerable prominence very quickly.The uncertainty regarding the coaching future in Boston is almost a given. The interim coach, Joe Sacco, has a rather dismal record of 25 wins, 30 losses, and seven overtime losses; he will be one of the candidates strongly considered while a full search is being conducted for the best possible candidate to lead this transformation. All of Jacobs, Sweeney, and Neely know that most of the definition of this summer's pathway for the Bruins will be their actions.Also Read: ""We had a 15-minute talk"": Panthers’ A.J.

Vegas Golden Knights have done an excellent job of highlighting how they don’t take penalties - Elliotte Friedman calls this job genius marketing

First Weekend Of Stanley Cup Playoffs | 32 Thoughts

Vegas Golden Knights got the benefit of the doubt where other teams didn’t get, says Elliotte Friedman

Also Read:

Elliotte Friedman, NHL Insider, puts it out there for the world to understand on his 32 Thoughts podcast show. What did he say? Elliotte Friedman called Game 1 of the First Round of the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs between the Vegas Golden Knights and Minnesota Wild a mean, nasty, and Vegas game. In his exact words, “This was a mean game. It was a nasty game. It was a Vegas game. They defend really well.” Why was that? Because “On a night, where there was a lot of discussion about cross-checks - there was one in this game that went uncalled to Nic(Nicolas) Hague.”TSN shared footage on their X platform of a cross-check that went unnoticed and was not penalized. An X user commented, “As well they should be … ref looking right at the play! The difference in the standard for penalty calls between this game & the Toronto game was night & day!! Hard not to believe the fix is in for Vegas & Toronto!” Another said, “Wilds frustration is understandable.” One fan wrote, “Cross-checking seems increasingly overlooked by officials.”The NHL referees are outright biased toward the top contenders of the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs - Vegas Golden Knights and Toronto Maple Leafs. We’re not saying that - the viewers and the fans are noticing that! However, there’s a genius strategy behind all this. Genius marketing strategy applied by the Vegas Golden Knights. NHL Insider Elliotte Friedman noticed it and spoke about it on his 32 Thoughts podcast show.Elliotte Friedman shared on the 32 Thoughts podcast show, “Vegas has done an excellent job of highlighting how they don’t take penalties, last three years - least penalized team in the league. This year, they put it up on their social that they’ve set a record for the fewest penalties taken.Sometimes you get reputations for being a dirty team, sometimes you get reputations for being a penalized team. Sometimes you get reputations for a team that dives or players who dive.When they(the Vegas Golden Knights) didn’t get a penalty for that cross-check we were talking about, does Vegas get the benefit of the doubt because they are clean? I’m curious about that.”Elliotte Friedman continued, “Because you know, in between these series, teams lobby. They lobby. When they’re going to go to Vegas after between Games 1 and 2, they’re going to say, ‘Anything you guys wanna talk about?’They’re gonna go to Minnesota between Games 1 and 2, and they’re gonna say, ‘Anything you guys wanna talk about?’ and you know Minnesota is gonna talk about, ‘How on earth does that cross-check not get called?’I just think it might be genius marketing by the Golden Knights, just like, hey, we don’t take penalties. We’re putting up on our social(media account) how our records say - we’re not taking penalties.”Elliotte Friedman said he wondered if it(Vegas Golden Knights being the least penalized team) got into people’s heads, and they got the benefit of the doubt where other teams didn’t get. Friedman concluded the cross-check discussion by saying, “And you know what, they(Vegas Golden Knights) have earned it, and now, they’re making sure everybody knows it.”Vegas Golden Knights head coach Bruce Cassidy shared with NHL.com on April 22, ""Competitiveness is always first. The most important element of puck management is one of our most important elements of how it gets away from us. Competitiveness, winning your races and battles, is always at the top of the list for me. It won't be any different.""","Elliotte Friedman, NHL Insider, called Game 1 of the First Round of the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs between the Vegas Golden Knights and Minnesota Wild a mean, nasty, and Vegas game.

The Boston Celtics played the Orlando Magic in Game 1 of the 2025 NBA Playoffs series. They beat the Magic 103-86. However, what caught fans’ attention was Jaylen Brown ’s idiotic statement about the Magic during a mic’d-up moment. Brown contributed satisfactorily to the team’s success, but has yet to reach last year’s NBA Finals MVP performance.Fans could not keep calm when Jaylen Brown tried to make a joke at the Orlando Magic. His joke fell flat and drew criticism as it actually made no sense. During a mic’d-up moment, he indulged in trash talk against the Orlando Magic, trying to make a nonsensical comparison. He said:“I told you. I think I will be playing with energy. They the Magic but they know who really got the magic over here, no Harry Potter.”No one could really make any sense of the statement made. When the statement was tweeted, the fans on the internet could not help but put this trash talk in the same league as Jayson Tatum’s, who is often ridiculed for his poorly crafted statements.Check a few of the interesting reactions from fans here:“Him and Jayson should never open their mouths,” - a fan suggested.“Stay in school, kids,” commented another fan.“Dumbest quote I’ve ever heard,” another fan expressed.“Magic in 5 after they read this” - was another commentJaylen Brown’s attempt at making an intended pun fellThe Boston Celtics beat the Orlando Magic 103-86 in Game 1. Payton Pritchard’s 19 points in about 25 minutes of play kept the Celtics' momentum high. His brilliant offense earned him his career playoff high numbers. Pritchard took the command, giving starters some time to rest, and that set the tone for the ensuing Celtics win as well.Derrick White broke the Magic’s defense and boosted the team’s offensive front. He scored the highest 30 points, which featured his hitting seven points off 12 three-point attempts.Jaylen Brown played for about 30 minutes, during which he contributed 16 points. His performance also featured two steals, two assists, and five rebounds. Was he at his best? Certainly not! He struggled converting shooting attempts to goals and could score only six from the 14 field goal attempts.Brown’s statement hit differently owing to his image of being an intelligent player, his educational background, and the responsible positions he holds.

NEW DELHI: Former fast bowler Mohammad Amir has revealed that he felt sidelined and ignored by the "" Pakistan cricket setup"" following the 2024 T20 World Cup , attributing the lack of communication from the board as the key reason behind his retirement late last year. Amir, along with Imad Wasim , had come out of retirement to participate in the 2024 T20 World Cup, where Pakistan’s disappointing campaign saw them crash out before the Super Eight stage.The duo announced their retirements on consecutive days in December.Speaking on a TV channel, Amir said, ""I felt sidelined and ignored by the Pakistan cricket setup after the T20 World Cup. After the T20 World Cup ended, no one even talked to me. No one told me if I was part of the future plans.""He added, ""A wise person understands the signs - if you're not in the plans, then you have to think about yourself. That's exactly what I did. I've made up my mind now - thank you very much, international cricket.""Amir had previously retired from international cricket in December 2020, citing issues with then-coaches Misbah-ul-Haq and Waqar Younis.He also disclosed that he had turned down a County contract after being asked by the PCB to represent Pakistan at the World Cup in the Americas.""Honestly speaking, I ended up spending more money than I made. I travelled with my trainer, and all those expenses came out of my own pocket. But that's a different matter,"" Amir said.On the game itself, Amir advocated for an aggressive mindset in cricket.""Cricket used to be fierce. Being mentally aggressive is part of the game's beauty.

Why Charles Barkley considers Stanley Cup the ultimate sports trophy



Charles Barkley on Contract Exit & Stephen A's Presidential Run

Why Stanley Cup is most respected trophy in sports



During a recent NBA on TNT broadcast, Charles Barkley didn't mince words when he spoke about the NHL ’s Stanley Cup trophy , delivering a passionate endorsement that caught the attention of fans across sports. With his signature mix of humor and respect, Barkley made a bold statement that the Stanley Cup stands as the pinnacle of sporting trophies, and he wasn't shy about making his case in front of his NBA colleagues.Barkley’s argument focused on the uniqueness of the Stanley Cup. Unlike any other major sports trophy, this iconic piece of silverware includes the names of every player, coach, and executive from winning teams dating back to 1893. It’s this element of tradition and recognition that Barkley highlighted as making the Cup special. “The greatest trophy in sports is in the house, y'all,” Barkley declared, standing beside Shaquille O'Neal, Ernie Johnson, and Kenny Smith. “Everybody’s name is on there. Whoever won the Stanley Cup… all those names on the bottom—the NBA doesn’t do that.”The idea of seeing the names of all champions engraved onto the trophy over the course of more than a century of hockey history fascinated Barkley. ""That’s amazing, that’s crazy, man,"" he said, referring to the long list of winners etched onto the Cup. It’s this growing legacy that adds weight to the Stanley Cup's mystique, making it a living piece of sports history that evolves every year.For Barkley, the physical presence of the Stanley Cup itself is enough to make it stand out from the rest. Unlike the NBA’s Larry O’Brien Trophy, the Stanley Cup is the only one of its kind, passed from champion to champion each season, adding new names to its rings. In contrast, other major sports trophies are replicated year after year, losing the personalized connection that makes the Cup so unique.What sets the Stanley Cup apart is also its grueling path to victory. NHL players face a demanding 82-game regular season followed by four rounds of intense playoff hockey. To claim the Cup, teams must endure one of the most physically taxing postseason schedules in all of sports. It's a combination of history, physicality, and tradition that has given the Stanley Cup its unmatched reputation.Also Read: “A goal is a goal”: Alex Ovechkin marks first overtime playoff goal with a reminder As Barkley has made clear, while he may not be touching the Stanley Cup anytime soon, he recognizes its place as the most revered and enduring championship trophy in all of sports. Whether you’re a hockey fan or not, Barkley’s appreciation for this iconic trophy certainly adds a new level of respect for the storied history of the Stanley Cup.","Charles Barkley said the Stanley Cup is the greatest trophy in all of sports.

Jason Whitlock said he was annoyed by female NBA commentators

Who doesn’t support women going shoulder to shoulder with men in sports? Well, there are a few exceptions—like sports columnist Jason Whitlock. He recently voiced his frustration over the presence of female commentators during NBA matches. And before critics could call him out for his conservative stance, he took matters into his own hands, branding himself as a “sexist pig” and “one of the worst people on the planet” on his show, Fearless with Jason Whitlock.On his show, Jason Whitlock vented specifically about ESPN's female commentators. He was particularly irritated during the Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Miami Heat playoff match, saying, “The Cavaliers were playing the Miami Heat and Candace Parker was squawking in my ear and I’m just like what are we doing here? Half the NBA playoffs, I got women describing the game for me.”Doubling down on his complaints, he added, “Every time I turn on ESPN there’s always a female co-host. A lot of times there’s two female co-hosts. Then I turn on the games for men and there’s women. And then when I turn on women’s sports over there, it’s just all women. The women can all do women’s sports but men have been somewhat outlawed [from] men’s sports.”“I know I’m a sexist pig, I know I’m one of the worst people on the planet but it just annoyed me,” he said, defensively labeling himself before the internet could respond with its own judgment.Candace Parker, the commentator Whitlock mentioned, is part of TNT’s NBA broadcast team. A former basketball player, Parker is widely considered one of the greatest WNBA athletes of all time. She played for the Los Angeles Sparks before retiring in 2024 and transitioning into sports commentary.Also Read: Cameron Brink picks her best dressed at the WNBA draft—and It’s not Paige Bueckers Looking ahead, the 2025 WNBA season will begin with pre-season games in May.

Some of the biggest names in the WNBA are Margo Dydek, Maria Stepanova, Liz Cambage, Bernadett Hatar, Han Xu and Brittney Griner.","Sports columnist Jason Whitlock said he was annoyed by female NBA commentators.

Multan Sultans:

Islamabad United:

New Zealand cricketer Colin Munro on Wednesday has sparked a heated debate in the ongoing Pakistan Super League (PSL).Munro, who is playing for Islamabad United has accused Multan Sultans ' all-rounder Iftikhar Ahmed for chucking.The drama unfolded in the 10th over of the match, when they were cruising to the target of 169 set by the Multan Sultans.Off-spinner Iftikhar Ahmed bowled a faster one in the blockhole and Munro somehow managed to dug it out. Just after the delivery, Munro gestured at the Iftikhar that he was chucking. Munro even bent his elbow while mimicking the action.Munro's gesture riled up the bowler Iftikhar Ahmed, who waked straight to one of the umpires to have a word with them. The entire Multan Sultan team also got involved. The umpires managed to diffuse the situation.Despite all this drama, defending champions Islamabad United continued their winning streak with a fifth consecutive win. Islamabad United chased the 169-run target set by Sultans with 17 balls to spare, banking on opening batter Andries Gous’ 80 not out inclusive of six fours and five maximums.Gous, who faced 45 balls to register his maiden HBL PSL half-century, lost his opening partner Sahibzada Farhan in the third over after the duo had put on 29 runs in pursuit of the target. No.3 batter Colin Munro walked in all guns blazing as he stitched a fiery 81-run partnership for the second wicket off 48 balls.Munro contributed a 28-ball 45 to the cause hitting five fours and two sixes. After Michael Bracewell removed Munro in 11th over, Mohammad Nawaz (21 off 19b, 1x4, 1x6) and Gous steered their team closer to the target with a 55-run third-wicket stand.Earlier, Multan Sultans elected to bat first after winning the toss and their opening batters Mohammad Rizwan (36 off 37b, 3x4s) and Yasir Khan (29 off 17b, 2x4s, 2x6s) put on a solid 51-run stand off 6.4 overs.After Mohammad Nawaz drew the first blood for United dismissing Yasir, Usman Khan walked in and hit the ground running with a 29-ball half-century. Shadab Khan broke Rizwan and Usman’s 65-run stand in 14th over with 116 runs on the board.Islamabad United bowlers kept a check on the run flow as they gave away only 42 runs in the last five overs dismissing Bracewell, Iftikhar Ahmed and Sultans’ top-scorer Usman (61 off 40b, 4x4s, 4x6s). Kamran Ghulam capped off the Sultans innings with a six and a four in his unbeaten six-ball 10.168 for 5 in 20 overs (Usman Khan 61, Mohammad Rizwan 36, Yasir Khan 29; Mohammad Nawaz 1-13)171 for 3 in 17.1 overs (Andries Gous 80 not out, Colin Munro 45, Sahibzada Farhan 22, Mohammad Nawaz 21; Chris Jordan 1-24)","New Zealand cricketer Colin Munro has sparked a heated debate in the ongoing Pakistan Super League (PSL) Munro, who is playing for Islamabad United has accused Multan Sultans'all-rounder Iftikhar Ahmed for chucking.

Liverpool moved closer to claiming their 20th Premier League title after Arsenal's 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace at Emirates Stadium on Wednesday, maintaining their 12-point lead at the top with just four games remaining for Arsenal and five for Liverpool.Arsenal's hopes of catching Liverpool were further diminished as they dropped points for the third time in four league games, despite taking the lead twice through Jakub Kiwior and Leandro Trossard.Crystal Palace responded with equalizers from Eberechi Eze and Jean-Philippe Mateta, leaving Liverpool needing just a point against Tottenham at Anfield on Sunday to secure the title.Liverpool's potential triumph would match Manchester United's record of 20 English top-flight titles, marking their first Premier League success since 2020 under new manager Arne Slot.Arsenal's focus appears to be shifting towards their upcoming Champions League semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain, their first appearance in the competition's last four since 2009.Manager Mikel Arteta made several changes to his lineup, with Bukayo Saka starting on the bench following an injury concern from the weekend's match against Ipswich, while Mikel Merino and Ben White were unavailable.Palace, preparing for their FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa on Saturday, began without strikers Mateta and Ismaila Sarr in their starting lineup.Arsenal took an early lead in the third minute through Kiwior's header from Martin Odegaard's free-kick, showcasing their set-piece prowess for the 16th time this season.Palace threatened immediately after through Daniel Munoz, whose volley was saved by David Raya.The visitors equalized in the 27th minute when Adam Wharton found Eze unmarked, who volleyed in off the post.Trossard restored Arsenal's lead before halftime, skillfully evading two defenders before scoring with a deflected finish.The second half saw both teams create opportunities, with Henderson making a crucial save from Saka's volley.Palace's persistence paid off when Mateta capitalized on William Saliba's error to chip the ball over Raya from 30 yards, securing a point for his team and effectively ending Arsenal's title hopes.Arsenal's goal difference of +34 compared to Liverpool's +44 makes their task even more difficult with the limited games remaining.Arsenal had previously delayed Liverpool's celebrations by defeating Ipswich 4-0 on Sunday, when a different result could have handed Liverpool the title.The draw maintains Palace's solid form under Oliver Glasner as they prepare for their important FA Cup fixture at Wembley.Both teams showed their attacking capabilities throughout the match, with Arsenal's set-piece expertise and Palace's resilient performance highlighting an entertaining encounter.The result leaves Liverpool in a commanding position to secure the title this weekend, while Arsenal must now balance their remaining league commitments with their Champions League aspirations.",Arsenal and Crystal Palace draw 2-2 at Emirates Stadium on Wednesday.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Belal Muhammad disses inactive rank holders of the welterweight division, in the likes of Kamaru Usman and Colby Covington

Belal Muhummad PLANS on ""Drowning"" Khamzat at 185, WILL NOT Fight Islam at 170, Previews JDM!

On April 2, 2025, UFC CEOmade an official announcement regarding the promotion's partnership with Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta to restructure the entire ranking system across the weight divisions. The proposal for the inclusion of AI in formulating the rankings of each fighter across different divisions has met with diverse reactions from the community, including even speculations of the new system directed towards the heavyweight champion Jon Jones. Ahead of his bout at, current welterweight championjoins the line of fighters who have vouched for White’s proposal of incorporatingBelal Muhammad’s journey in the UFC kicked off with a defeat against Alan Jouban at UFC Fight Night. Ever since the fighter has bounced back and has kept his losses in check, taking his MMA record to a whopping 24-3-0. The fighter is now scheduled to fight Jack Della Maddalena at UFC 315 . While the current welterweight champion prepares to defend his title, JDM is on a mission to claim the world championship title. Both fighters are at their peak, with Maddalena not having a single loss ever since his debut in the UFC.Ahead of the highly anticipated bout, Muhammad, in a talk with Submission Radio, talks about his upcoming fight, the current state of the welterweight division, Islam Makhachev ’s rumored move up to the welterweight division, Ilia Topuria not deserving the lightweight title shot and many other issues. While talking about the current state of the welterweight division, the fighter seemed positive.“I think the division is the best that it’s ever been in a while. And they have got the best welterweight that’s ever been at the top right now and so he [winner of UFC 315] is willing to fight all these fights. So it doesn’t matter who’s going to win. All I need is a call in date from the UFC” Muhammad stated while talking about his possible next bout after UFC 315.The response was followed by a welterweight fight opinion. When asked about who would probably win between Kamaru Usman and Joaquin Buckley, Muhammad was quick to take the side of Buckley, considering that Usman has not been active inside the Octagon for a couple of years. Despite being inactive, Usman still manages to be on the top ranking within the division, to which Muhammad was not very keen.“I mean you still got Colby Covington on the top rank, right? I don’t know who does these rankings, but they need to get the AI system in there immediately. Because these guys don’t belong in the rankings. These guys don’t belong in there right now. And they are just sitting at their spots.There’s plenty of more deserving guys that belong in there.”Colby Covington, despite his ranking within the division, has been on a disappointing run lately. The gap between his fights is almost a year, sometimes even more, and the results are not in his favor either. Similarly, Nigerian fighter Kamaru Usman has not fought for almost 2 years, and despite being inactive, he is placed at number 4 in the division.Also read: Top UFC welterweight contender welcomes Islam Makhachev's move up: “He's the perfect example of the new evolution of fighters” Dana White’s AI-based ranking system is expected to debut towards the latter half of the year.

Poll How has Sachin Tendulkar influenced modern cricket players? Consistency in performance Mental toughness Playing style

Legendary Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar , widely regarded as cricket's greatest batter, celebrated his 52nd birthday on Thursday. Known for his unmatched consistency, longevity, and ability to challenge the world's best bowlers, Tendulkar's career spanning from 1989 to retirement saw him accumulate 34,357 runs in 664 international appearances at an average of 48.52, making him the highest run-scorer in international cricket history.Tendulkar's influence extends beyond India into all major cricketing nations, contributing significantly to the sport's current popularity, competitiveness, and financial success. Modern cricket stars including Virat Kohli, Steve Smith, Kane Williamson, Joe Root, Virender Sehwag, and MS Dhoni have credited their playing styles and match-winning abilities to Tendulkar's influence.Beginning his international career at age 16 in 1989, Tendulkar received his Test cap and made his ODI debut on December 18 of the same year. His remarkable ability to adapt and evolve his batting technique in response to injuries, team requirements, and varying conditions defined his career.In Test cricket, Tendulkar amassed 15,921 runs in 200 matches at an average of 53.78, including 51 centuries, setting records that remain unmatched. His achievement of playing 200 Test matches stands as a testament to his longevity.His One Day International career was equally impressive, scoring 18,426 runs at an average of 44.83 in 463 matches, with 49 centuries and 96 half-centuries. He became the first cricketer to score a double hundred in ODIs, achieving this milestone against South Africa at Gwalior in February 2010.A defining moment in Tendulkar's career came when he helped India win the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup . He contributed significantly with 482 runs in nine matches, including two centuries and two fifties, finally achieving his dream of lifting the World Cup at his home ground, Wankhede Stadium.Tendulkar holds the record for most runs in World Cup history, scoring 2,278 runs in 44 innings across 45 matches at an average of 56.95, including six centuries and 15 fifties. His knockout match performance included 339 runs at an average of 48.42 with four half-centuries.In the ICC Champions Trophy, Tendulkar participated in five campaigns, scoring 441 runs in 16 matches at an average of 36.75, with one century and one fifty. His combined ICC event statistics show 2,719 runs in 61 matches at an average of 49.43.Though Tendulkar played just one T20 International, scoring 10 runs, he found success in the Indian Premier League with Mumbai Indians. He scored 2,334 runs in 78 IPL matches at an average of 34.83, including one century and 13 fifties.His IPL career highlights include winning the title with Mumbai Indians in 2013 and securing the Orange Cap in 2010 for scoring the most runs (618) in 15 matches at an average of 47.53 with five fifties.Throughout his career, Tendulkar set numerous records, including 100 international centuries and 164 half-centuries, establishing himself as the most prolific run-scorer in cricket history. While Virat Kohli surpassed his ODI century record during the 2023 Cricket World Cup at Wankhede Stadium, Tendulkar's impact on cricket transcends statistics, earning him the title "" God of Cricket .""","Sachin Tendulkar celebrated his 52nd birthday on Thursday.

In an unusual incident during Wednesday's IPL match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Mumbai Indians , SRH wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan walked off after a delivery from Deepak Chahar despite no apparent contact between bat and ball, leading to his dismissal amid their batting collapse in Hyderabad.The left-handed Kishan, who had just scored his first run in the previous over, attempted to play a delivery from Chahar that was drifting down the leg side.MI wicketkeeper Ryan Rickelton collected the ball, but neither he nor the bowler appealed for a caught behind. On-field umpire Vinod Seshan was about to signal a wide.Unexpectedly, Kishan walked away, indicating he had edged the ball to the keeper, prompting Seshan to raise his finger for the dismissal.MI captain Hardik Pandya, who had made a half-hearted appeal, appreciated Kishan's gesture by patting him on his helmet and shoulders.Replay analysis revealed no contact between bat and ball, with UltraEdge showing no spike as the ball passed the left-hander's bat.While batters typically know when they've edged the ball, the decision was particularly significant given SRH's ninth position on the points table and the favorable batting conditions. Kishan's dismissal left SRH struggling at 9/2 in the third over.""You think you have seen it all after all these years and yet I must admit the Ishan Kishan's dismissal leaves me perplexed,"" commented Harsha Bhogle on X, expressing his surprise at the incident.","SRH wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan walked off after a delivery from Deepak Chahar.

KKR are the best placed with six points while the other franchises have won only four points so far. However, every side currently has a chance of making it to the IPL playoffs. Here's a look at what the teams need to do to qualify for the playoffs:Winning two out of their remaining six matches should prove enough, considering they have the best NRR currently. Sai Sudharshan and Prasidh Krishna are the current Orange and Purple cap holders showcasing their dominance across all departments. The Gujarat-based franchise have bounced back incredibly this season following an underwhelming performance last year. GT face RR, SRH, MI, DC, LSG and CSK in their remaining matches.The Axar Patel-led side will need to win three out of their remaining seven matches, having played one game fewer than GT.

Poll What do you think is the main reason for CSK's poor performance this season? Injuries to key players like Ruturaj Gaikwad. Inconsistent batting and lack of partnerships.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

Chennai Super Kings (CSK) captain MS Dhoni has revealed the ""most ridiculous"" rumour he had heard about himself.When MS Dhoni exploded onto the cricketing scene in the early 2000s, his incredible power-hitting and remarkable fitness fueled widespread speculation about his diet.Rumours circulated that his daily intake included a staggering five litres of milk, and this was believed to be the reason behind him hitting those massive sixes.At a promotional event in Chennai, he was asked about this year-old rumour. The former India captain replied with a smile: ""I drink five litres of milk a day.""""I used to drink maybe a litre of milk, you know, spread throughout the day. But four litres, you know, it's a bit too much for anyone,"" he added.The former India captain also laughed at the rumour about him making lassi in a washing machine.He said: ""First of all, I don't drink lassi.""The 43-year-old is currently leading CSK in the absence of regular captain Ruturaj Gaikwad, who has been ruled out due to an elbow injury.Having already lost six out of eight games, the bottom-placed CSK will find it extremely difficult to win all their remaining six games to make it to the last four stage, which looks like a long shot at the moment.Dhoni rarely gives his opinion on any issue, but he didn't mince words in dissecting his team's poor batting. CSK have consistently failed to either chase or put up big scores.""I think we were quite below par, because we all knew that dew would come in the second half, and we were in a position to exploit the middle overs,"" Dhoni said, speaking about the lack of cricketing sense among the batters.",MS Dhoni reveals the'most ridiculous' rumour he has heard about himself.

Poll Should the BCCI intervene in this situation involving Azharuddin? Only if evidence is provided No Yes

Huge prediction! KL Rahul would play in place of Rishabh Pant in 2026 T20 World Cup

Former India captain Mohammad Azharuddin has expressed deep disappointment over the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) Ombudsman’s directive to remove his name from the North Stand at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.The former cricketer did not hold back his emotions, calling the situation “heartbreaking” and a “complete disgrace to the sport.”""It pains me deeply to say this, but I sometimes regret having played cricket. It’s heartbreaking to see individuals with little to no understanding of the game now in positions to teach and lead. It’s a complete disgrace to the sport,"" he told IANS.Azharuddin, who served as HCA president from September 2019 to September 2023, said he intends to take legal action and urged the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) to step in.""I am determined to pursue legal action against this injustice, and I urge the BCCI to intervene and take appropriate action. This issue isn’t isolated – Sunrisers Hyderabad also had a dispute with the association over passes, highlighting a pattern of mismanagement and conflict,"" the former skipper said.He further added that the situation has become personal, especially after he was barred from contesting the HCA elections .""What’s unfolding is beyond comprehension, and it hurts me on a personal level. I was not allowed to contest the HCA elections, simply because I exposed the corruption within the system. That truth made me a target,"" he said.The decision to remove Azharuddin’s name from the stadium stand was taken by Justice (Retd) V. Eswaraiah, the HCA’s ethics officer, following a petition filed by Lords Cricket Club — a member unit of the state association.The petition alleged that Azharuddin, during his tenure as HCA president, misused his position by taking arbitrary decisions.

Chinnaswamy Stadium on Thursday.

Bearded by Punjab Kings in their own den, Royal Challengers Bengaluru exacted revenge on Shreyas Iyer’s men in less than 48 hours. It was a quick turnaround. The good news: After eight matches, RCB are unbeaten in five away games. The bad news: They are yet to crack the winning code at home.Before the start of the season, their winning percentage at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium was less than 50% and it went south after three losses on the trot this season. Adding insult to their injury has been the performance of their ‘home boys’. KL Rahul, Mohammed Siraj and Yuzvendra Chahal , RCB heroes not long ago, have found success against their former team.On Thursday, when RCB host Rajasthan Royals , the only solace they will probably find is the four-match losing streak of the former champions and their inability to close out matches from winning positions. The absence of injured captain Sanju Samson and the inability of stand-in skipper Riyan Parag to deliver has added to Rajasthan’s woes.That said, Rajasthan also have some former RCBians in the line-up: leggie Wanindu Hasaranga and the big-hitting southpaw Shimron Hetmyer. Not forgetting Rajasthan’s orchestrator and one of Karnataka’s most-loved public figures, Rahul Dravid Nobody in the IPL probably knows the pitches at Chinnaswamy better than Dravid, who is still getting round in a wheelchair or crutches following an injury he picked up during the KSCA Group III league last month, understands that the Royals can ill afford any more slip-ups.Dravid admitted, “We know we must play well to be still alive in this tournament. You need to play well in critical moments, and it hasn’t happened to us. Every game from here on is very important and we’ve got to try and play the best cricket we possibly can and hopefully get the result.”","Royal Challengers Bengaluru hope to get rid of their at-home troubles as they host Rajasthan Royals in match 42 of the Indian Premier League 2025.

With many a fortress crumbling in IPL 2025 , seeking solace in one’s home turf is no longer an option for some teams. In all the talk ‘unfavourable’ home conditions by franchises, RR head coach Rahu Dravid has weighed in with his views.“One of the things about the big auction is that it’s a fresh start for a lot of players. Even though they may be your ‘home’ team players, they are playing for the team or on those grounds for the first time. When there’s a change of squad, the home advantage may not be that significant,” explained the former India skipper and coach.Citing examples from RCB and RR, Dravid added: “Someone like Phil Salt , who was with KKR, has come to RCB for the first time. Likewise, someone like Nitish Rana is playing for RR this year for the first time. So, for him, Jaipur is a new ground.” On their home turf, RCB batters have been guilty of gifting their wickets, and skipper Rajat Patidar didn’t shy away from admitting this. “Shot selection matters,” Patidar said, adding: “This time, the wickets are two-paced and there is variable bounce. So, I think the bowlers are getting a lot of help. However, the more we focus on hitting square of the wicket, the better it will be.”","Rajasthan Royals head coach Rahu Dravid has weighed in on 'unfavourable' home conditions in IPL 2025.

Chennai: The wait kept getting longer and longer, till it was 19.4 overs. With one ball to go for the Lucknow Super Giants innings to fold on Tuesday, skipper Rishabh Pant walked in and failed to connect any of the two deliveries he faced, leaving his team in doldrums.The game against Delhi Capitals wasn’t a case in isolation. The mercurial Pant acquired for an alltime high Rs 27-cr to be skipper of LSG has been a shadow of his once destructive self. After nine games this season, he has aggregated a paltry 106 runs, 63 of which came in one game (against CSK).The strike rate, too, is 96.36, which is ridiculously low by his standards. For one, Pant hasn’t given himself the time to settle down in one slot, going up and down the order. It hasn’t allowed him his own mental freedom, so central to his game.His former India colleague Cheteshwar Pujara put the the lefthander travails in perspective. “Pant is trying too hard to be MS Dhoni , which he is not,” Pujara said in a post-match show, a point that former India wicketkeeper batsman Deep Dasgupta too agrees with. “As much as Rishabh tries to be Dhoni, he is fundamentally different to MSD.Dhoni was a player who used his head brilliantly to overcome the inadequacies in his game and become the player that he was. Pant, on the other hand, has a lot of heart and less head. His natural talent is greater, and it is important that he doesn’t bind himself overthinking his game,” Dasgupta, commentating on the IPL, told TOI.LSG, of course, is a demanding franchise which is desperate for silverware and franchise pressure took its toll on KL Rahul last year. But one understands that owner Sanjiv Goenka hasn’t been interfering at all this time around, letting Pant and the technical team do their job.What could really be hurting Pant then is the self-imposed clutter in his mind. He has already lost his place in the Indian white-ball set-up with Rahul and Sanju Samson taking leads, and the 27-year-old might just be feeling the heat. “It seems he is muddled in his mind. It is true that he is fighting for his place in the Indian white-ball side and that is probably affecting his thought process,” Dasgupta said.He said that Pant comfortably puts on his captain’s hat when fielding but needs to be “the free soul” that he has always been when batting. “Injury notwithstanding, Pant’s decision to hold himself back on Tuesday is baffling,” added Dasgupta, “If he thinks that Abdul Samad is better suited to give the innings the necessary push, then he is probably underselling himself.” With five wins in nine, LSG are very much still in the reckoning for a top-four berth, and that is a sliver of hope for skipper and franchise. But with Nicholas Pooran ’s form slightly dipping at a crucial stage, it is important that Pant pulls himself out of this recent white-ball mess of his own making.Poor form is a dangerous thing, and it can easily permeate into his red-ball game as well. With India embarking on a crucial five-Test series to England just after the IPL, every Indian cricket follower will hope that Pant rediscovers his touch by the end of May.",Rishabh Pant has been a shadow of his once destructive self.

: In continuing to be unpredictable, Sunrisers Hyderabad hastened their doom. On Wednesday when Mumbai Indians held all the aces at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, the hosts, beset by a variety of problems, not adapting to situations being one of them, were so dismal that the vociferous crowd soon switched loyalties after the teams lined up to pay a minute’s silent tribute to the victims of Pahalgam terror attack Hardik Pandya got everything right, including the toss on a pitch where the Sunrisers had pummelled Rajasthan Royals and Punjab Kings into submission. His move to put the hosts in was fully justified with Deepak Chahar and ‘player of the match’ Trent Boult striking early to restrict SRH to 143/8.Given that low totals are tricky, Mumbai, peaking at the right time this season, shunned risk and clinically finished the contest with 4.2 overs to spare for their fourth straight win. Despite losing his opening partner Ryan Rickelton cheaply as Jaydev Unadkat clung on to a return catch, and first leg hero Will Jacks after a 64-run stand for the second wicket, Rohit Sharma showed his class as he cruised to 70 (46b, 8x4, 3x6).His second straight halfcentury and the 53-run third wicket stand with Suryakumar Yadav (40*; 19b, 5x4, 2x6) completed a seven–wicket win which was set up by their bowlers. Chahar was brilliant as SRH failed to score off the bat in the first over of an innings for the seventh time. Boult dismissed Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma as batsman after SRH batsman played into MI’s hands.In between, Chahar scalped Ishan Kishan. The No. 3 batter, who has scored 33 runs in seven innings after his ton on debut for SRH, made it easy for umpire Vinod Seshan by walking. The ‘Snicko’ later showed he had not edged the waft down the legside.Nitish Kumar Reddy failed to clear the infield and with two wickets apiece, Chahar and Boult reduced SRH to 13/4 inside five overs and 24/4 in the Powerplay — the worst this season. Heinrich Klaasen (71; 44b, 9x4, 2x6) was the sole bright spot in the SRH innings.The South African was calm as the carnage unfolded at the other end. He watched as Aniket Verma succumbed to Pandya’s short delivery, and essayed a knock that showed good things come to those who wait. Abhinav Manohar played a good hand as an Impact sub and added 99 runs for the sixth wicket (63b) with Klaasen..","Hardik Pandya got everything right, including the toss on a pitch where the Sunrisers had pummelled Rajasthan Royals and Punjab Kings into submission.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians extended their winning streak to four matches with a commanding seven-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad in their IPL 2025 clash at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Wednesday.Riding on Rohit Sharma ’s classy 70 off 46 balls and another clinical all-round performance, MI chased down the modest target of 144 with ease, finishing at 146/3 in just 15.4 overs.This emphatic win propelled Mumbai from sixth to third on the points table, with their Net Run Rate also receiving a significant boost.Rohit, continuing his resurgence with a second consecutive half-century, looked in sublime touch as he struck eight fours and three sixes. He received strong support from Suryakumar Yadav, who provided the finishing touches with a blazing unbeaten 40 off just 19 balls, studded with five boundaries and two sixes.The match was effectively decided within the powerplay itself as Sunrisers Hyderabad crumbled to 35/5 following a top-order collapse. Trent Boult (4/26) and Deepak Chahar (2/12) ran through the SRH lineup with sharp, disciplined bowling. The only resistance came from Heinrich Klaasen and impact sub Abhinav Manohar, who stitched a 99-run stand to lift their team from complete disaster.Klaasen top-scored with a fluent 71 off 44 deliveries, including nine fours and two sixes, while Manohar added a patient 43 off 37. Despite their efforts, the total of 143/8 was never going to be enough against a rampaging MI batting unit.Interestingly, the match had its share of drama. Ishan Kishan walked off voluntarily after nicking one down leg — a moment of rare honesty — even as the umpire had initially signaled a wide. The umpire raised his finger only after Kishan began his walk, despite no appeal from the fielding side.The five-time champions had also beaten SRH earlier in the season and now look poised for a strong push towards the playoffs.For SRH, the loss is another blow in an already faltering campaign. They remain second-last on the table with just two wins from eight games, and their top-order’s lack of confidence continues to haunt them.","Mumbai Indians beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by seven wickets in IPL 2025 clash.

CHENNAI: After a nightmarish Indian Super League campaign, where they did not even come close to qualifying for the playoffs, Chennaiyin FC will be eager to salvage some pride in the Super Cup in Bhubaneswar. Chennaiyin will begin their run with a challenging round-of-16 fixture against ISL big gun Mumbai City FC on Wednesday.The knockout tournament offers CFC another opportunity to end a long wait – while Chennaiyin have not won silverware since their 2017-18 ISL triumph, they have not been at the continental level since the 2018-19 season. For CFC to pose a threat, they will have to stay “consistent”, a quality that head coach Owen Coyle believes they lacked in the ISL.“When we are at our best, we can stand toe-to-toe with the best teams. The cup competition is a great opportunity for everybody, because there is an AFC spot up for grabs. There is an incentive for everyone to go and win the cup,” Coyle said.“We started the ISL season well and finished strongly. We had a poor middle section of the season. For sure, there is added motivation to finish the season on a high. We were very inconsistent in the ISL; that is what cost us a place in the top-six. We have to get back to giving good performances consistently,” added Coyle.Chennaiyin should show drastic improvement in the defensive department, after keeping only four clean sheets in the league stage of the ISL. The luxury to use both Ryan Edwards and Elsinho at the heart of defence at the same time – a club can field a maximum of six foreigners – could solve some issues for the chief coach.Coyle acknowledged that there is a huge scope for improvement in defence but stressed that the team would not get into a shell for the sake of a clean sheet. “That (poor defending) was the biggest thing that hurt us in the ISL; we did not defend well enough. But in cup competitions, you have to win games. We will certainly not be seeing a more defensive approach; we will see a team going out to win games,” said Coyle.What should give CFC a bit of hope for Wednesday’s game is the fact that Mumbai could miss a few key players due to different reasons (injuries, rehabilitation and personal situation). While Jon Toral and Jayesh Rane have been ruled out of the tournament, Yoell van Nieff, Jeremy Manzorro and Prabir Das are doubtful starters for the clash on Wednesday.Asked if CFC will have the upper hand, Coyle replied: “We are under no illusion; Mumbai are a wonderful side. Van Nieff and Manzorro could probably make it to the game. They have many good Indian players like Lallianzuala Chhangte, Vikram Pratap Singh and Mehtab Singh who add to the mix.”",Chennaiyin FC face Mumbai City FC in the Indian Super League (ISL) Super Cup.

Liverpool are on the verge of securing their second Premier League title, needing just three points from their remaining five matches to become champions. Arsenal's victory over Ipswich Town has pushed the earliest possible title confirmation date to Wednesday (April 23), when Arsenal face Crystal Palace.Liverpool currently sit at the top of the Premier League table with 79 points after 33 games played, holding a commanding 13-point lead over second-placed Arsenal, who have 66 points.The Reds require only three points from their available 15 to mathematically secure their 20th overall league title. Even if Arsenal win all their remaining matches, they can only reach 81 points, while Liverpool would have 82 points with just one more victory.The title race could be decided as early as Wednesday if Arsenal lose to Crystal Palace at home. In this scenario, Arsenal would remain on 66 points with only 12 points left to play for, making it mathematically impossible to catch Liverpool.Should Arsenal defeat Crystal Palace, Liverpool could still clinch the title on Sunday (April 27), with a victory over Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield. This would put Arne Slot's team 13 points ahead with only four matches remaining.The current Premier League standings show Liverpool in first place with 79 points and a goal difference of +44, while Arsenal occupy second position with 66 points and a +34 goal difference. Third place follows with 60 points and a +14 goal difference.Arsenal's win at Ipswich Town on Sunday eliminated the possibility of Liverpool securing the title that day, shifting the focus to the upcoming midweek fixtures as the next potential title-deciding moment.The title race has now entered its final phase with just five weekends of action remaining in the 2024/25 Premier League season. Both teams have challenging fixtures ahead as they navigate through the closing stages of the campaign.This upcoming period will determine whether Liverpool can maintain their substantial lead and secure their second Premier League title, or if Arsenal can mount an unlikely late challenge in the remaining matches.","Liverpool currently sit at the top of the Premier League table with 79 points after 33 games played.
