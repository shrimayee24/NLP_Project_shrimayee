Where to watch India vs Australia 2nd Test?

The second Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) is set to begin on December 6th at the Adelaide Oval, with India facing Australia. India currently lead the five-match series 1-0, following their impressive 295-run victory in Perth.This Adelaide Test, like the corresponding fixture in the 2020/21 BGT series, will be a day-night affair. As preparation, India participated in an unofficial two-day match against the Prime Minister’s XI. Due to rain interruptions, the match was shortened to a 50-over contest, which India won by six wickets.The 2020/21 BGT series also began in Adelaide, marking India's first day-night Test match away from home. India, under Virat Kohli's captaincy, won the toss and opted to bat first.Despite early dismissals of openers Prithvi Shaw and Mayank Agarwal, India managed a first-innings total of 244. Kohli led the scoring with 74, supported by Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane, who both contributed scores in the 40s.The Indian bowlers then delivered a strong performance, limiting Australia to 191. R. Ashwin was the pick of the bowlers, securing four wickets, while Jasprit Bumrah added three.India held a 53-run lead going into their second innings, but what followed was a dramatic collapse. They were bowled out for a shocking 36, their lowest-ever Test score. Josh Hazlewood produced a devastating spell, taking five wickets, and Pat Cummins claimed four.Australia needed only 90 runs to win, and they achieved victory comfortably despite losing two wickets. Joe Burns anchored the chase with an unbeaten fifty, securing a 1-0 series lead for Australia in the four-match series.India will be looking to maintain their series lead, while Australia aims to level the series in Adelaide. The day-night format adds another layer of complexity to this crucial encounter. Recalling the previous day-night Test at the same venue will undoubtedly be on the minds of both teams.India's dramatic collapse in their second innings during that match will serve as a stark reminder of the challenges posed by the pink ball under lights. Conversely, Australia will draw confidence from their dominant performance in that match, especially their bowlers' ability to exploit the conditions.The Adelaide Oval has historically been a good batting track, but the day-night conditions can introduce unpredictable swing, making it challenging for batsmen, especially during the twilight period. The pink ball also behaves differently compared to the red ball, tending to swing more and offer more assistance to the bowlers. This element of unpredictability adds to the excitement and makes the upcoming Test match a highly anticipated contest. Both teams boast strong bowling attacks, and the battle between bat and ball under lights promises to be captivating.The second Test between India and Australia will begin on December 6 (Friday).The second Test between India and Australia will be played at the Adelaide Oval in a day-night format.The second India vs Australia Test will begin at 9:30am IST (2:30pm local time, 3pm AEDT, 4am GMT, 11pm EST and 8pm PST on December 5).

India XI (predicted):

In the second Test of the five-match Test series, India are set to make at least two changes to their playing XI when Rohit Sharma's men take on Australia at the Adelaide Oval on Friday. The second Test of the series will be a day-night affair and be played with a pink ball.In the India playing XI, captain Rohit is expected to replace Devdutt Padikkal while Dhruv Jurel is expected to make way for Shubman Gill.With the discussions largely hinging on the opening slot, Rohit confirmed KL Rahul will open the batting alongside Yashasvi Jaiswal. The 37-year-old batter added he would drop to the middle order.Rohit had also occupied the middle-order slot during the tour game vs Prime Minister's XI. Rahul, meanwhile, did the opener's job exceptionally well so for him to retain the spot in the playing XI does not come as a surprise.In the bowling department, the seamers are expected to continue and so is Washington Sundar as the solitary spinner despite R Ashwin's solid record at Adelaide.For the hosts, Scott Boland has come into the playing XI as a replacement for the injured Josh Hazlewood.

Mitchell Marsh has been passed fit to bowl.The 35-year-old Boland will play his first Test match since last year's Ashes when he fronts up for the pink ball match.Marsh, who pulled up sore after bowling 17 overs in Perth, prompted selectors to add uncapped all-rounder Beau Webster as injury cover Australia captain pat Cummins said he expected Marsh to bowl at some stage in the day-night Test despite carrying a reported back injury and not bowling at training.Nathan McSweeney, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Mitchell Marsh, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins (capt), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Scott BolandYashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma (capt), Rishabh Pant, Washington Sundar, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Harshit Rana, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj",Rohit Sharma expected to replace Devdutt Padikkal in India XI.

Why This Game Slaps



The Packers vs. Lions matchup isn't just any Thursday night game; it’s a high-stakes battle that could shake up the NFC North standings . With Detroit roaring to maintain dominance and Green Bay clawing for a playoff spot, this game promises fireworks. From rising stars to seasoned pros, here are the five players who are about to steal the show—and yes, you’re going to want to keep your eyes glued to every play.Also read - NFL Today: Top 5 Stories to Watch Heading into Week 14 Jordan Love has beenfor Green Bay lately, leading them to clutch wins as he finds his groove. But the Lions' defense isn't here to play nice—they already picked him apart in their last meeting. Can Love redeem himself under the bright lights? If he's locked in, expect some jaw-dropping deep throws.Packers fans know when Aaron Jones is on, he is. Coming off injury issues, Jones is out to prove that he still is one of the league's best dual-threat backs. His ability to break through Detroit's defense—or to sneak past for a big catch—could be the game-changer that Green Bay needs.Thehas been lighting up secondaries all season. Over 1,000 yards already, St. Brown does not have a chill button when it comes to making defenders look silly. If Jared Goff gets him the ball (spoiler: he will), Green Bay's secondary could be in for a long night.Goff has quietly been one of the league's most consistent QBs this season. Don't let his nice-guy demeanor fool you; he's lethal when given time. Watch for him to exploit Green Bay's defense with calculated passes to St. Brown and rookie sensation Sam LaPorta.Gary has been a thorn in the side of opposing QBs, laying out double-digit sacks and living rent-free in backfields. With Detroit's O-line missing key players, he is poised for damage. Take him to come through with a game-changing sack-or two.This is not just a divisional game; it's one of two teams looking for a win to prove their places in January football. If the Lions are looking to cinch their playoff spot and the Packers look to stay relevant, every snap counts. Set out your snacks, line up those fantasy teams, and here's to drama, touchdowns, and maybe even some NFC pandemonium.Also read - NFL Schedule, Week 14: Must-Watch Games with Playoff Implications",The Packers and Lions face off in a high-stakes NFC North game on Thursday.

Australia playing XI for second Test:

Adelaide Oval : Scott Boland is back in the Australian Test team after nearly a year and a half. Captain Pat Cummins confirmed Boland's inclusion and also announced Mitch Marsh 's bowling fitness for the Adelaide day-night Test.Boland last played a Test during the previous Ashes series. He replaces Josh Hazlewood, who suffered a side strain in the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Perth.Boland's inclusion strengthens Australia's pace attack, offering a potent combination alongside Mitchell Starc and Cummins.""Traditionally here, there is normally a little bit of nip, which obviously suits Scotty quite well,"" Cummins told media at the Adelaide Oval.""All of last summer he was geared up to go, but no one fell over.""It feels like it's been quite a while (since Boland has played). As a captain, it's pretty awesome to have someone like Scotty come straight in.""You know he can bowl a huge amount of overs if needed, he is super consistent and has performed at this level.""Despite experiencing back stiffness that limited his bowling in India's second innings, Mitch Marsh retains his place in the team. Cummins assured that Marsh is fit to bowl in Adelaide.""I'm guessing at some point, he will be required. It's not a huge concern, you would probably need to speak to the physio,"" said Cummins.""He will ... prioritise his overs for the game instead of in the nets.""India's team for the second Test, starting Friday, is yet to be announced. However, the return of captain Rohit Sharma, who was away for the birth of his second child, and opener Shubman Gill, who was injured, is expected.Sharma's return will bolster India's batting lineup, while Gill's recovery provides another opening option.The day-night Test in Adelaide promises an exciting contest between these two cricketing giants. The match will be crucial for both teams in the context of the series, with India looking to build on their Perth victory and Australia aiming to level the scores.

This left them with Rs 83 crore—the second-largest purse among the 10 franchises—to strengthen their squad.RCB made some impactful additions during the auction, notably acquiring all-rounder Liam Livingstone for Rs 8.75 crore and wicketkeeper-batter Phil Salt for Rs 11.50 crore, significantly boosting their batting lineup.

A heated argument ensued between Packers coach and a Lions fan

NEW DELHI: England batter Zak Crawley achieved a remarkable Test record by smashing a six in the opening over against New Zealand in Wellington.After New Zealand's captain Tom Latham elected to field first, Crawley aimed for a quick start whilst trying to find his rhythm. Facing Tim Southee in the first over, he initially got runs through a thick inside edge towards the leg side off the first delivery.Following two runs off the subsequent delivery, Crawley waited for his next scoring chance on Southee's final ball. He struck it powerfully straight back over the bowler, managing sufficient height to clear the long-off boundary for six.The over yielded 10 runs for England and marked a significant milestone for Crawley.This feat marks only the third instance in Test cricket history where a six was scored in the opening over.The previous two instances occurred in the same over when West Indies' Chris Gayle struck Sohag Gazi for two sixes during a Test match against Bangladesh match in 2012.Notably, as Gazi bowled spin, Crawley became the first batsman to hit a six off a pace bowler in the first over of a Test innings.",Zak Crawley hits a six in the opening over against New Zealand in Wellington.

BRISBANE: After clouting Megan Schutt for consecutive boundaries, Smriti Mandhana belatedly poked feebly at a short delivery in the channel from the Australian pacer, only to feather an edge which Beth Mooney gloved.Mandhana (8) trudged back to the dressing room, disappointment written all over, a wicket that marked the beginning of the end of a dismal Indian performance at the Allan Border Field here on Thursday. Eyeing their first away series win against Australia, India began disastrously, never recovered and crashed to a five-wicket loss in the opening fixture of a three match series.On a sunny afternoon, the toss was the only thing skipper Harmanpreet Kaur called right. The batters didn't quite ram home the advantage of taking first strike on a batting-friendly surface. The Amol Muzumdar-coached team showed little in terms of application and intent and were bowled out for a mere 100 in 34.2 overs.As collapses go, it was heap, although saved somewhat by Jemimah Rodrigues' laboured 23 (42 balls). Australia, playing their first series after their shock eight-wicket loss to South Africa in the T20 World Cup semifinal in October, suffered a mini collapse but debutant Georgia Voll's unbeaten 42-ball 46 after pacer's Megan Schutt's career best 5/19 saw the home team through with 202 balls to spare.This was India's second lowest total in the format after their 79 against the same opposition in 2012. Lack of rhythm was the best way to describe India's erring batting line-up which was undone in quick time by Schutt's outswingers.With Kim Garth (1/20) keeping it tight at the other end, the 31-year-old Schutt sent back openers Mandhana and Priya Punia (3) by the seventh over. The fact that barring Mandhana's strike rate of 80, none of the others managed a strike rate above 60. Australia got off to a flyer with the opening pair of Phoebe Litchfield (35) and Voll putting on 48 from 35 balls.Pacer Renuka Singh (3/45) triggered a mini-collapse and young leggie Priya Mishra (2/11) bowled an impressive two-over spell, but given the measly target, all they managed was to delay the inevitable.India:100 all out in 34.2 overs (Jemimah 23; Megan Schutt 5-19) lost to Australia: 101/5 in 16.2 overs (Phoebe Litchhfield 35, Georgia Voll 46 n.o; Renuka Singh 3-45, Priya Mishra 2-11)","India bowled out for 100 in 34.2 overs at the Allan Border Field.

The 24-year-old Punjab cricketer achieved this milestone during a Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy match against Meghalaya in Rajkot, reaching his ton in just 28 balls while chasing a target of 143.His blistering innings of 106 runs off just 29 balls resulted in an extraordinary strike rate of 365.52 and included 11 sixes and eight fours.This explosive performance marked a significant turnaround for Sharma, who had been experiencing a relatively quiet tournament. Prior to this match, he had scored 149 runs in six innings, with only one half-century.Gujarat’s Urvil Patel had previously set the record earlier in the same tournament, also scoring a 28-ball century against Tripura in Indore.Before this year’s tournament, the record was held by Rishabh Pant , who had taken 32-balls for a century against Himachal Pradesh in 2018.Meghalaya posted a total of 142 for 7 in their 20 overs. Powered by Sharma's incredible innings, Punjab chased down the target in under 10 overs.Sharma's aggressive approach is evident in his T20I strike rate of over 171 for India, reflecting the attacking mindset he brings to the national team. He already has a century (against Zimbabwe) and a half-century to his name in international T20s.Abhishek showcased his power-hitting prowess in IPL 2024, registering the fastest IPL fifty for Sunrisers Hyderabad , reaching the milestone in just 16 balls against Mumbai Indians.He concluded IPL 2024 with his best season yet, amassing 484 runs at an impressive strike rate of 204.21, further establishing his reputation as a dominant force in T20 cricket .For IPL 2025, Abhishek joins Sunrisers Hyderabad’s formidable core alongside Heinrich Klaasen, Pat Cummins , and Travis Head.

""My father left his job for me and there has been a lot of sacrifice behind my story. One day, I saw him crying because of the financial problems we were facing, and I was like, this is not how you can be... that my father made the sacrifices and you play cricket just for fun.""At that time, I became serious and I got the growth. I worked hard and it paid off. As a son from a middle-class family, I am so proud that my father is happy now. I gave my first jersey to him and saw the happiness in his face,"" he added.Despite facing challenges, Reddy's determination paid off, and he was able to make his father proud by earning his maiden Test cap from his childhood hero, Virat Kohli The partnership he shared with Kohli during the second innings at Perth was a dream come true for the young all-rounder.Reddy acknowledged the impact of the advice he received from KL Rahul , who encouraged him to slow down the game and visualize his preparation through shadow practice. This approach helped him stay focused and perform well under pressure.As a ""three-dimensional"" player, Reddy expressed his eagerness to contribute further to the team's success. He is particularly excited about the prospect of bowling with the pink ball and exploring its behaviour in the upcoming day-night Test at Adelaide Oval .",Nitish Reddy made his Test debut for India against Australia at Perth.

Rohit Sharma: 'KL Rahul to open, I will bat somewhere in the middle'

India vs Australia: Rohit Sharma in the middle order: Why it makes long term sense

Virat Kohli and his love for Adelaide

Nitish Kumar Reddy's Test debut was a memorable one. He contributed significantly to the team's 295-run victory over Australia in Perth. His scores of 41 and 38 not out, along with a wicket, were instrumental in the youngsters' success.Reddy received his debut cap from his idol, Virat Kohli . He was at the crease when Kohli scored an unbeaten century in the second innings. Reddy recounted the journey from taking a selfie with Kohli and Anushka Sharma at the 2018 BCCI awards to sharing the playing eleven with him.""This was a safety photo, at the time he (Virat Kohli) was so famous. I felt that if I don't get a photo chance, let's take a picture now. It's reminding me of my childhood memories. From childhood, I was a huge fan of Virat bhaiya. I used to watch every match of his, so that he scores a hundred and celebrates it. I liked his celebration a lot – at that time, I used to calculate my age so as to see if he doesn't retire when I make my debut for India.""Reddy described watching Kohli approach his century. He was so focused on Kohli's achievement that he almost forgot he was nearing a half-century himself.""Now playing with him and I was seeing him close to ten runs, then five runs and I was thinking, he's close to getting his hundred. Even, I didn't realise that I was close to getting my fifty – it would be my first fifty in Tests if I scored 12 runs. I was so pumped up when he got his 81st hundred and it was a great moment to see,"" said Reddy in a video posted on bcci.tv.Having made his T20I debut in October, Reddy reflected on his cricketing journey. He recalled his father's sacrifice in leaving his government job to support his career in Visakhapatnam.""To be honest, I was not that serious when I was young. My father left his job for me. There has been lots of sacrifice in my story.""Reddy described a turning point in his career. Witnessing his father's emotional distress due to financial difficulties spurred him to take his cricket more seriously.""One day I saw him crying due to financial problems he had, and it felt like I had to do the hard work. Like, your father did this sacrifice and you are just enjoying cricket by playing it for fun. So that time, I took it seriously and suddenly in one year, I got the growth, did the hard work and it paid off.""Reddy expressed pride in his father's happiness and acknowledged the recognition his father received for his son's achievements. He presented his first jersey to his father as a token of gratitude.""Everyone said, 'Mutyala Reddy, you made your son go this far'. As a son of a middle class family, I am so proud that my father is so happy now and I gave my first jersey to him, where I saw happiness in his face and felt immensely proud.""Reddy also shared how KL Rahul's advice helped him during his debut in Perth. He felt comfortable approaching Rahul for guidance.""I was a bit nervous at first on how I will interact with players, who I have seen on TV while growing up. So, if I have any problems, I just want to go & talk with KL bhai. I somehow feel good vibes from him, whatever suggestions he gives that works for me.""Rahul's advice to slow down the game proved beneficial for Reddy, who felt things were moving too quickly in his first match.""He once said, 'Macha, when you go out in the centre, everything is going so fast. Don't go so fast, just slow down the game'. It's because my first match went in that way; everything happened so fast in seconds and that really helped me before going out to bat in my debut match.""Reddy highlighted the importance of shadow practice in his preparation. He visualized facing different bowlers and planning his shots based on the situation.""I do like doing a lot of shadow practising. At that time, I visualise bowlers who are going to bowl to me and what all shots I can play to them as per the situation. When you actually face them in the centre, it will be like 'Arey, you already practiced against them in shadow practice'. So, that's how I keep my routine simple.""Looking ahead to the second game in Adelaide, Reddy expressed his excitement about playing with the pink ball. He had a glimpse of this during the tour match against Prime Minister's XI, where he scored 42.""I am so excited, I had a good debut and I just want to continue my contribution to the team. With the pink ball, I want to see how much swing I can get as a fast-bowler. When I faced the first ball (in the practice match), I left it and saw how it behaved.""Reddy aims to maintain his hunger for good performances. He believes in his all-round abilities and wants to contribute to the team in any way possible.""I just want to maintain my hunger for good performances. I personally feel I do good in three dimensions, and want to help the team whatever they want from me, so that's what I want to just focus on.""","Nitish Kumar Reddy made his Test debut against Australia in Perth. He scored 41 and 38 not out, along with a wicket. Reddy received his debut cap from his idol, Virat Kohli.

Kohli's love affair with Adelaide

Historic win

NEW DELHI: With an astounding victory in the first Test against Australia in Perth, the Indian cricket team is on a high. But now that's in the past and the second Test is set to get underway at the Adelaide Oval from December 6.The day/night Test could well be the toughest game for India on the tour as Australia are yet to taste defeat with the pink ball here and the visitors don't have fond memories from their last fixture in 2020. India were bundled out for just 36 in their second innings and registered their lowest total in the format.Overall, India have played 13 Tests at the Adelaide Oval and have won only 2, lost 8 and managed to draw 3 matches.India played their first Test at Adelaide in January 1948 under the captaincy of Lala Amarnath and despite centuries by Vijay Hazare in both the innings, they lost the match by an innings and 16 runs.India's second Test at Adelaide in December 1967 saw them losing the match by 146 runs. The third Test at Adelaide in January 1978 saw India fighting hard but the Aussies ended up victorious by 47 runs.After three consecutive defeats at Adelaide, the visitors finally managed to draw a Test at the venue in January 1981 under the captaincy of the great Sunil Gavaskar. The result was possible due to Sandeep Patel who smashed 174 despite batting in the Test after sustaining injuries to his head, inflicted by bouncers from Australia's fast bowlers during the first Test at Sydney.Four years later, the legendary Kapil Dev led from the front as captain by taking 8 wickets in Australia's first innings and Gavaskar hit a brilliant 166 in the first innings total of 520 as India drew the December 1985 fixture at the venue.More disappointment was in store in 1992 as chasing 372, captain Mohammad Azharuddin hit 106 but India were bowled out for 333 runs to lose their next Test by 38 runs.During India's 1999 tour to Australia under the captaincy of Sachin Tendulkar , the first Test was played at Adelaide. Chasing 396, India lost the Test by 285 runs.India, however, made history in their next Test at Adelaide in December 2003 and took a 1-0 series lead against Australia in Australia for the first time ever.The Aussies racked up 556 and India were 85/4 but Rahul Dravid (233) and VVS Laxman (148) put up a 303-run stand for the fifth wicket. Ajit Agarkar then took 6/41 and Dravid hit an unbeaten 72 as India won the match by 4 wickets.India's next tour to Australia came in 2007-08 when all hell broke loose due to the Monkeygate scandal. By the time the teams reached Adelaide for the fourth and last Test of the series in January 2008, the Aussies already had an unassailable lead in the series.Sachin Tendulkar hit 153 in the first innings and it was Virender Sehwag 's 151 in the second essay which ensured a draw.For the next tour of Australia in 2011-12, some seniors left for Australia early to acclimatise to the conditions but even that couldn't prevent India losing the series 0-4.In the fourth Test of the series in Adelaide in January 2012, a young Virat Kohli roared to his maiden Test century. Although India lost the match by 298 runs, Kohli's hundred established him as a key player in India's Test line-up and marked the beginning of a prolific Test career.Kohli continued his love affair with Adelaide when India next toured Australia, hitting twin hundreds on captaincy debut in December 2014. India came close to an improbable victory but fell short, losing by 48 runs.India's victory in Adelaide in December 2018 during the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy was a historic moment in Indian cricket as it set the tone for India's maiden Test series win on Australian soil.Cheteshwar Pujara scored 123 but India were bowled out for 250. The bowlers did well to earn a crucial 15-run lead and the visitors set a challenging target of 323 for Australia. Jasprit Bumrah (3/68), Mohammed Shami (3/65), and Ashwin (3/92) starred with the ball as Australia were bowled out for 291 for a 31-run victory.This was India's first Test win in Adelaide since 2003 and marked the beginning of India's historic 2-1 series victory, the first-ever Test series win by an Asian team in Australia.India's next tour of Australia began on a disastrous note as the infamous 36 all out in Adelaide occurred during the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in December 2020.Captain Virat Kohli left the series after the Adelaide Test for the birth of his child, handing the reins to Ajinkya Rahane.From thereon, India made an incredible comeback by winning the Melbourne Test under Rahane's leadership, drew the Sydney Test in heroic fashion and clinched the series 2-1 with a historic victory at the Gabba in Brisbane.The 36 all out remains a stark reminder of cricket's unpredictability and resilience as India transformed their fortunes dramatically in the same series. It now remains to be seen what Adelaide has in store for India.","India have played 13 Tests at the Adelaide Oval and have won only 2, lost 8 and managed to draw 3 matches.

Why Rohit Sharma's decision to play KL Rahul as opener makes sense,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/why-rohit-sharmas-decision-to-play-kl-rahul-as-opener-makes-sense/articleshow/116004524.cms,"KL Rahul and Rohit Sharma (Julian Finney/Getty Images)

India vs Australia: Unleash Rohit Sharma in middle order

""He ( KL Rahul ) will open the innings. I will play somewhere in the middle... "" Rohit Sharma ended the suspense when he confirmed India's openers for the Adelaide Test vs Australia from December 6. Rahul did a phenomenal job with the bat in both innings of the Perth Test and continued with his good touch during the practice fixture PM XI in Canberra.Even after Rahul's returns with the bat, there was no clarity whether he would continue in the opening position especially after Rohit rejoined the squad after missing the series opener due to the birth of his second child.The Indian captain, however, chose to stick with the successful combination at top of the order and feels Rahul deserves that spot.""We want result, we want success. Those two guys at the top they batted brilliantly in Perth. I was watching from home. Rahul was brilliant to watch. He deserves that place at this point in time,"" says Rohit.The skipper further adds that the move to bat down the order will not be an easy one for him but it's in the larger interest of the team.""There is no need to change that now, may be things will be different in future. Personally not easy for me (to move down) but for the team it made a lot of sense,"" explains Rohit while adding that he will bat somewhere in the middle.Rahul, who has faced significant criticism recently for underperforming, got an opportunity to open the innings for India in the first Test against Australia, and he did not disappoint the fans as he scored crucial 26 in first innings and gave India a solid start in the second innings to score 77 runs.The right-handed batter, often considered one of the most technically sound players playing for India, has not had a consistent run with the bat in the longest format. He has been moved up and down the order, across formats, and the lack of consistency in the batting position could well be the reason behind his inconsistent returns.Despite having played 233 innings for India across all formats, KL Rahul still lacks a fixed batting position. The 32-year-old has already amassed over 8,200 runs, including 17 centuries for India. Among these, he has scored more than 3,000 runs in Tests, including 8 centuries.Rahul has already scored centuries in SENA countries, demonstrating his ability to perform on tracks with extra bounce and pronounced swing while also excelling against spin in subcontinental conditions. Rahul’s flexibility to bat anywhere often works for the team, but it also leaves him vulnerable to criticism.Rohit Sharma's Test career took off after he was given a permanent opening slot, allowing him to operate with the mindset of an opener for a long period. KL Rahul too hasn't had a bad run at top of the order. In 77 innings as an opener, he has scored 2654 runs with seven centuries and 13 half-centuries, averaging 40, and a highest score of 199.However, when moved down the order, Rahul's performance drops. In the 16 innings he has played in other positions, he has managed just 430 runs, including one century. As the team looks to groom younger players, the 32-year-old Rahul still awaits stability in his batting position.While Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal have established themselves as India’s premier opening pair in Tests, Rahul’s performances as an opener have been noteworthy. During India’s England tour 2021-22, Rahul emerged as India’s third highest run-scorer of the series, behind Rohit and Rishabh Pant With form on his side and Rohit's recent struggles vs pace as he was dismissed by New Zealand pacers four times in six innings during a Test series, Rahul is set to get an extended run at top of the order. It makes sense for now, a lot of sense. But it remains to be seen whether Rahul will find the consistency which everyone expects from him.","KL Rahul and Rohit Sharma confirmed as openers for Adelaide Test. Sharma says he will bat somewhere in the middle of the order. Rahul scored crucial 26 in first innings of first Test against Australia. The 32-year-old has scored more than 3,000 runs in Tests, including 8 centuries.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116004624,imgsize-42570,width-400,resizemode-4/116004624.jpg"

India vs Australia: KL Rahul keeps his batting position for Adelaide Test vs Australia a SECRET!

NEW DELHI: The much-anticipated second Test between India and Australia at the Adelaide Oval is set to be an intriguing encounter, featuring the unique challenge of a day-night pink-ball contest. With India leading the series 1-0 after a commanding victory in Perth, this match carries high stakes for both teams.While India welcomes back skipper Rohit Sharma, who confirmed he will bat in the middle order to allow KL Rahul to continue opening, Australia will look to capitalize on their impressive record in pink-ball Tests at home.Weather conditions could play a significant role, particularly on the opening day, where forecasts indicate a 40% chance of rain and potential thunderstorms on Friday.As per AccuWeather.com, the forecast on Friday is particularly bad in the afternoon -- 'cloudy with 47% chance of rain at 12 pm, and thunderstorms with 51% chance of rain at 1 pm.'But it gets better at the time of toss, 2 pm local time, with the forecast of 'cloudy with 15% chance of rain.' The forecast gets better after that, with rain forecast decreasing every hour.The weekend and the following days appear more favorable for uninterrupted play, though some light showers could appear on the fifth day, should the match stretch that far.The Adelaide Oval pitch promises a balanced contest. Traditionally known for its coarse, mat-like grass and low clay content, it offers assistance to fast bowlers early in the match, especially during the twilight and night sessions when the pink ball tends to swing and seam more. As the game progresses, the pitch usually flattens, allowing batters to score more freely if they can settle in. Spin is also expected to play a role, particularly in the later stages, with the dry surface aiding turn and grip.India will rely on their bowlers to exploit the conditions under lights, while their batters, bolstered by the form of Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul, aim to build solid partnerships. Australia, with their formidable pace attack led by Mitchell Starc and the ever-reliable Nathan Lyon in the spin department, will seek to make the most of the conditions.The last time India played at this venue, they endured their infamous 36 all-out collapse. However, this team has grown significantly since then, boasting a strong record in day-night Tests. For Australia, the Adelaide Oval remains a fortress in pink-ball cricket, adding to the intrigue of this high-stakes clash. Weather permitting, fans can expect an enthralling contest between two evenly matched teams.","The much-anticipated second Test between India and Australia at the Adelaide Oval is set to be an intriguing encounter.

Not easy for me but it's the best for the team,"" Rohit told reporters on the eve of the second Test.Rohit's Test career took a turn for the better after he began opening in 2019.""What KL has shown outside India, he deserves that place (opening slot),"" Rohit added.Rohit said he decided to change his batting position keeping the team's interests in mind.""We want result, we want success. Those two guys at the top they batted brilliantly in Perth. I was watching from home. Rahul was brilliant to watch. He deserves that place at this point in time.""There is no need to change that now, may be things will be different in future. Personally not easy for me (to move down) but for the team it made a lot of sense,"" said Rohit adding that he will bat somewhere in the middle.In India's remarkable Perth win, Rahul - opening for the first time since February 2023 - chewed up 74 balls as India collapsed for 150 in 298 balls in their first innings. He then stayed put for 176 balls in a 201-run opening stand as Jaiswal scored 161.Even though Rohit was elated following their triumph in Perth, he acknowledged that it would be difficult to play with a pink ball under lights at Adelaide Oval.Australia had bundled out India 36 in their second innings to inflict an eight-wicket defeat in 2020 and they have won all seven of their day-night Test matches at the venue.""You are so used to playing with a red ball and the pink ball certainly does a little bit more than the red ball,"" Rohit said.""At the same time we have been training here for the past three days and I certainly felt that the more time you spend playing the pink ball, it gets a little easier.""The pink ball will have its challenges under lights, during the day as well -- you just have to find your own way of dealing with it.""",Rohit Sharma confirms KL Rahul will open for India in second Test against Australia.

"'No team wants to fall behind ...': Tom Latham, Ben Stokes call for review of over-rate regulations in Test cricket",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/no-team-wants-to-fall-behind-tom-latham-ben-stokes-call-for-review-of-over-rate-regulations-in-test-cricket/articleshow/115996546.cms,"New Zealand captain Tom Latham, left, and England captain Ben Stokes (AP Photo)

Loud taunts, players heckled during Team India nets in Adelaide

New Zealand's captain, Tom Latham , agrees with England skipper Ben Stokes , regarding concerns about current over-rate rules in Test cricket . They believe a review is needed, especially for matches dominated by seam bowling. This follows penalties imposed on both teams for slow over-rates during the first Test match in Christchurch, which England won.Current International Cricket Council (ICC) rules mandate 15 overs per hour. Both teams received fines and lost World Test Championship (WTC) points despite the match ending two days early.""The frustration stems back to the Ashes,"" Stokes said in Wellington ahead of the second Test.Stokes has been openly protesting by refusing to sign over-rate sheets. He voiced his frustrations in Wellington before the second Test.""It’s been over a year since I raised this issue, and we’ve heard nothing back from the ICC. There’s never an over-rate issue in Asia because of the heavy use of spin. There needs to be consideration for seam-dominant matches,"" Stokes said.England's over-rate penalties have already eliminated them from next year's WTC final contention. New Zealand's slim hopes of qualifying were also hampered by the three-point deduction from theChristchurch Test .Latham admitted the difficulty of maintaining the required rate when seam bowling is prevalent. He pointed out that this isn't a problem in subcontinental conditions where spin bowling is more common.""It’s certainly a challenge to get through 15 overs an hour, especially when the ball’s flying to the boundary,"" he said.He suggested a review of the regulations, emphasizing that no team wants to be penalized for slow over-rates.""In subcontinental conditions, where spin dominates, this isn’t an issue. Perhaps it’s time to review the regulations, as no team wants to fall behind on over-rates,"" Latham added.The second Test at the Basin Reserve presents a similar challenge. Both teams have primarily seam bowlers, with only one specialist spinner between them. This increases the likelihood of further over-rate issues.","New Zealand captain Tom Latham agrees with England skipper Ben Stokes.
