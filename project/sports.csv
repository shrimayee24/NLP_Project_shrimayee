NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) fast-bowler Yash Dayal took to social media to express his admiration and respect for Virat Kohli , the former Indian captain.Dayal's heartfelt message came in the wake of controversial statements made by former Indian leg-spinner Amit Mishra , who alleged that Kohli's aggressive nature has led to him having fewer friends and that it was Kohli who had instigated a rift with Afghanistan cricketer Naveen-ul-Haq during an IPL match between RCB and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).In his Instagram post, Dayal shared a picture with Kohli, captioning it, ""It's an honour to stand beside you, bhaiya @virat.kohli.""Furthermore, Dayal shared the post on his Instagram story, using audio from Kohli's final game as RCB captain. In the background, Kohli can be heard saying, ""I have given my best. I don't know how the response has been, but I have given 120 percent to this franchise every time, which is something I will now do as a player.""In an appearance on YouTuber Shubhankar Mishra’s show ""Unplugged,"" Amit Mishra commented, “He (Kohli) started abusing our players (in the LSG vs RCB rematch in Lucknow). He didn’t have any grudges with Kyle Mayers, but he abused him as well. Naveen-ul-Haq was bowling, and he abused him too. A lot could have been avoided, but Kohli chose not to.""Mishra further added, “For social media, it all seemed to be over between them. But do you think Naveen will ever respect Kohli again?

SKY or Hardik? Suspense continues

MUMBAI: With India likely to express its inability to tour Pakistan for the Champions Trophy in February next year citing no government clearance for the tour, there could be interesting things in store at the International Cricket Council's (ICC) series of meetings from July 19-22 in Colombo.TOI has learnt that BCCI secretary Jay Shah is travelling to Colombo on Thursday for the meetings, which will conclude with the Annual General Meeting on July 22.While the agenda (TOI has a copy) of the AGM doesn't mention any discussion on the issue, the vexed matter is likely to be taken up by the boards of both India and Pakistan (set to be represented by Pakistan Cricket Board chief Mohsin Naqvi) in the 'any other business' category.The Champions Trophy will be held from February 19 to March 9. As per the PCB's proposed schedule, India are supposed to play all their three league matches in Lahore (February 20 vs Bangladesh, February 23 vs New Zealand & March 1 vs Pakistan). The semifinals will be held in Karachi (March 5) and Rawalpindi (March 6) while the final will be held in Lahore on March 9.However, if India refuse to go to Pakistan for the tournament, the ICC could be forced to mull the possibility of a hybrid model for the tournament, with India playing their matches in UAE or Sri Lanka. However, the PCB too is likely to come out with a strong response in that case.The BCCI secretary may also attend the India vs Pakistan Women's Asia Cup match in Dambulla on Friday.Meanwhile, the suspense over who would be India's next T20 captain-Hardik Pandya or Suryakumar Yadav-continued for another day, with the Indian team now likely to be picked on Thursday.It's learnt that in an online meeting on Tuesday, new head coach Gautam Gambhir and the selectors discussed a few things about Indian cricket, including the need to give Surya, the world's second ranked T20 batsman, the regular T20 captaincy - as TOI had reported on Wednesday - as Hardik was prone to breakdowns.However, no final decision was taken on the matter.","India likely to express its inability to tour Pakistan for the Champions Trophy in February next year citing no government clearance for the tour.

ODI Squad:

NEW DELHI: Suryakumar Yadav has been appointed as the captain of the Indian T20I team for the upcoming three-match series against Sri Lanka, commencing on July 27. The announcement was made on Thursday, with Shubman Gill being named as the vice-captain for the T20 series.In addition to the T20 series, the selectors have also announced the squad for the ODI series against Sri Lanka, which will take place next month.The team will depart early next week for the tour which will mark the beginning of new head coach Gautam Gambhir's three-year tenure.Rohit Sharma , the current ODI skipper, and Virat Kohli have been included in the 50-over squad. Shubman Gill will continue his role as the vice-captain for the ODI series as well.The ODI squad features two new faces in the form of Riyan Parag and Harshit Rana. Parag, who showcased his batting prowess by scoring seven half-centuries in the recently concluded Vijay Hazare Trophy, has earned his maiden call-up to the ODI team. Meanwhile, Harshit Rana, a promising fast bowler from Delhi, has also been included in the ODI squad.Veteran all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, who stepped away from T20I cricket following India's victorious campaign in the West Indies last month, was not included in the ODI squad. Jadeja's retirement from the shortest format coincided with those of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.In an anticipated move, Jasprit Bumrah, who has been the spearhead of India's pace attack for an extended period, was given a well-deserved break from the upcoming ODI series.India will play three T20Is and as many ODIs in the series. The T20I leg of the series, which will take place in Pallekele, kicks off on July 27 and concludes on July 30. The ODIs will be played in Colombo, starting August 02.Suryakumar, 33, has been selected as the captain for the upcoming T20 series, despite Hardik Pandya being the designated vice-captain during India's successful campaign in the Americas.Although Pandya, a star all-rounder, is three years younger than the dynamic batsman from Mumbai, he was not the favored choice for the captaincy role by both Ajit Agarkar, the chairman of selectors, and Gambhir.According to reports, Pandya was informed by the team management on Tuesday that Suryakumar was being considered as a long-term captaincy option. While Pandya is expected to be part of the T20 squad, he has chosen to opt out of the ODIs due to personal reasons.Suryakumar's leadership credentials were on display last year when he led India to a 4-1 victory over Australia in a T20I series in November, followed by a 1-1 draw against South Africa.Despite losing his national contract for missing domestic cricket, Shreyas Iyer has made a comeback to the ODI squad along with KL Rahul, who performed the dual role of keeper-batter during the 50-over World Cup last year at home.Iyer captained the Kolkata Knight Riders to victory in this year's IPL, with Gambhir serving as the team mentor.Gambhir will take over from Rahul Dravid, whose tenure ended last month with the World Cup triumph. Despite being persuaded by Rohit, Dravid declined an extension.As India look ahead to co-hosting the 2026 T20 World Cup with Sri Lanka, the team is focused on building a strong squad for the future.Suryakumar Yadav (C), Shubman Gill (VC), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rinku Singh, Riyan Parag, Rishabh Pant (WK), Sanju Samson (WK), Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Ravi Bishnoi, Arshdeep Singh, Khaleel Ahmed, Mohd.

Suryakumar Yadav was named the T20 captain since Rohit has retired from T2OIs.Kohli and Gambhir have had on-field disagreements and even came eye to eye on multiple occasions in the Indian Premier League, but as stated in the Cricbuzz report, ""Kohli is believed to have stated that previous issues will not affect their professional relationship in the dressing room"" and that he has ""communicated this clearly to the relevant BCCI officials"".The report also states that discussions on the issue were possibly held after the T20 World Cup final.The Sri Lanka tour will be Gambhir's first assignment as India's head coach since he replaced Rahul Dravid in the role. Dravid's tenure ended after the T20 World Cup last month.The way Kohli and Gambhir, whose last appointment as Kolkata Knight Riders' mentor helped the franchise win IPL 2024, approach their cricket, both are cut from the same cloth. They like to wear heart on sleeve while representing the county and don't shy away from letting their joy or displeasure be known, even in the public eye.No coach or player likes to lose, but with Gambhir, that narrative goes a little further with the added, intense patriotic fervour he brings to the dressing room. On that note, again, Gambhir is not different to Kohli, or vice versa, and maybe a step ahead.When those things combine for the common cause, which is winning matches and trophies for India, it can make the team invincible in all formats, with Kohli part of Tests and ODIs only going ahead, having quit the T20Is.","Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir have had on-field disagreements.

NEW DELHI: The national selectors have opted for stability as they announced Suryakumar Yadav as T20I captain and handing over the vice-captaincy to Shubman Gill in both T20Is and ODIs for the white-ball tour of Sri Lanka later this month. Hardik Pandya was relieved of vice-captaincy in both formats.The selectors have also convinced Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli , who recently announced their retirements from T20I cricket, to travel to Sri Lanka for the three ODIs.The selection committee, led by Ajit Agarkar , has been firm on its stand of having a stable leadership for the white-ball teams. It was reported on Jul 17 that Agarkar and new head coach Gautam Gambhir had conveyed their thoughts to Hardik who was expected to assume full-time T20I captaincy. It is learnt that Surya's performance as a captain will be monitored over the course of next year and the appointment will be reviewed going into the T20 World Cup in 2026.""The selectors and Gambhir have been very clear with their plans. With Hardik being prone to injuries, they felt that it would be wise to have someone who is focused on just the T20 format. Gambhir thinks very highly of Surya's game awareness,"" a BCCI source told TOI.It was also felt that the stalwarts like Rohit, Kohli and Bumrah needed to be in the team environment more with the ICC Champions Trophy being about six months away. Bumrah however, has been rested to manage his work load. Kuldeep Yadav has also been rested for the T20Is. ""Gambhir will not have many ODIs before going for the ICC Champions Trophy in Feb. He too feels the need for steady leadership,"" the source said.In giving Gill vice-captaincy in both formats over Hardik and KL Rahul, the selectors have sent clear signals that they are looking to groom a young player to take over the reins after Rohit. Rahul's leadership has come under fire when he led India in a few matches and also at Lucknow Super Giants in the IPL.The team management feels that the planning for the 2026 ODI World Cup needs to start now and hence the transition needs to be carried out at the earliest. TOI also understands that the selectors are giving Rishabh Pant a greater role in the leadership group across formats.Interestingly, Ravindra Jadeja , who too announced his T20I retirement after the T20 World Cup, has not been named in the ODI squad. While no official reason has been given for it, sources say that the selectors and team management feel that it is time to find alternatives for Jadeja.Jadeja's batting has not been up to the mark in white-ball cricket for a while. With Axar Patel evolving as a potent replacement, Washington Sundar has been named in both squads.In another interesting call, Riyan Parag has been named in both teams while Abhishek Sharma has missed out. TOI understands that the selectors feel Parag could develop into an impact batter.Parag made his T20I debut in Zimbabwe this month but failed to make a mark. However, his stellar performance in Vijay Hazare Trophy followed by the IPL could not be ignored.Shreyas Iyer, who lost his central contract earlier this year for missing out on domestic cricket, has been drafted back into the squad. Iyer has been a consistent batter in ODIs for some years now.BCCI secretary Jay Shah , however, left a rider in the media statement on Wednesday: ""The BCCI will continue to monitor player availability and participation in the upcoming domestic cricket season, 2024-25.""",Hardik Pandya relieved of vice-captaincy in both formats.

And off the field we also spend so much time so the rapport we have on the field become very good.""Surya adds, ""It's important for me to keep things simple, I am a process oriented man, I like to keep things simple and that's what I try and tell everybody that try and keep things really simple, don't try and be a different version of yourself.""The 33-year-old Suryakumar will captain a 15-man T20I team on a three-match tour of Sri Lanka beginning on July 27 in Pallekele.Shubman Gill , who recently guided a second-string Indian team to a 4-1 T20I series triumph in Zimbabwe, was named vice-captain for T20I and ODI matches.After the T20I series, India will take on Sri Lanka in three matches on August 2, 4 and 7 at Colombo's R.

Are Gautam Gambhir and Jay Shah divided over India's T20I captaincy? Squad announcement likely today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/are-gautam-gambhir-and-jay-shah-divided-over-indias-t20i-captaincy-squad-announcement-likely-today/articleshow/111823173.cms,"LIVE UPDATES:

The decision around who will be India's next T20I captain is the hottest topic on cricket's discussion boards across platforms and possibly the reason behind the delay in announcement of the white-ball squads for the tour of Sri Lanka beginning July 27.As per various reports, the BCCI was scheduled to announce the squads on Wednesday but because there was no consensus yet on whether Hardik Pandya or Suryakumar Yadav will led the team in T20Is, the announcement was delayed for another day and will reportedly happen on Thursday.Rohit Sharma announced his retirement from T20Is after India won the T20 World Cup under his captaincy last month. That left the BCCI to decide whether to bring Hardik back as skipper in the shortest format or let Surykumar Yadav, who replaced Hardik after his injury last year, to continue to lead the team in T20Is.Hardik was in rehab after injuring his ankle in the middle of the ODI World Cup last year and returned to competitive cricket only in the IPL earlier this year. In between that, Surya led India in the team's 4-1 T20I series win against Australia.Moreover, new coach Gautam Gambhir is reportedly apprehensive about Hardik's fitness as the allrounder has suffered injuries (back, ankle) in the recent past.Several reports also suggested that Gambhir had a robust meeting with BCCI secretary Jay Shah over a video call from Delhi, where they discussed the approach for the road ahead but couldn't reach a decision over T20I captaincy , with Gambhir in favour of Surya and Shah backing Hardik.Seniors like Rohit, Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah are likely to be rested for the tour. However, a Cricbuzz report on Wednesday suggested that Rohit might make himself available for the three-match ODI series.The Sri Lanka tour will be Gambhir's first assignment as head coach after he replaced Rahul Dravid in the position at the conclusion of the T20 World Cup.The tour kicks off on July 27 with the first game of the three-match T20I series.","The BCCI was scheduled to announce the squads on Wednesday but because there was no consensus yet on whether Hardik Pandya or Suryakumar Yadav will led the team in T20Is, the announcement was delayed for another day.

'Everyone's different…': What Sourav Ganguly learnt from Virender Sehwag about leadership with NatWest series victory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/everyones-different-what-sourav-ganguly-learnt-from-virender-sehwag-about-leadership-with-natwest-series-victory/articleshow/111822170.cms,"NEW DELHI: It was on July 13, 2002 when Sourav Ganguly and his young team won the NatWest Trophy final against England, chasing down a steep target of 326 with three balls to spare at the famed Lord's cricket ground .Chasing 325, Virender Sehwag smashed a 49-ball 45, while Ganguly hit a 43-ball 60 in an opening stand of 106 in 14.3 overs.Now a video is doing the rounds on the internet, where Ganguly is addressing a small gathering at Lord's telling what he learned about leadership from his opening partner Virender Sehwag that day and how he became a better captain after the NatWest series win.Ganguly says, ""I'll tell you a story here, for me that was a very important part of leadership and I spoke to you about man management. It was Sehwag batting with me in the middle. We were chasing that night - 320 where I took my shirt off and I was very upset at lunch because England got 300-325 and in those days, this was about 2002, you very rarely chased 325, it was not like modern day cricket where you just keep hitting. The game has changed a lot.""Ganguly continues, ""So I walking down this long room at Lord's and Sehwag was whistling behind me , he is that sort of a person, I turned back, abused him and said 'ek toh 325 bana dete ho and you think it's a joke'. He walks past me and said. 'skip we're going to win this'. I said 'let's see'. So we went, we started very well, both of us. After 7 overs, we were about 70 for no loss. I was batting on 40 odd and Sehwag was also batting. SoRonnie Irani was bowling and I went up to Viru and said we've got a good start, I think we can get this total but don't get out. We've played the harder bowlers, there's a weaker bowler coming in, let's just keep taking 6-7 runs an over because that's what we need. He said 'yeah, yeah fine no problem.' So Ronnie runs up from this end, he hits the first ball over mid-off for four. So I was at the non-striker's end I went up to him, tapped and said 'good shot, so we've got 4 runs in the over, just keep rotating (the strike). He said 'yes yes no problem'. So he goes back to his end, the next ball Ronnie pitches it up, he hits it over the top over mid-on, one bounce four. So I again go up to him and said well played, well played, good shot, we've got 8, you can still take singles. He said 'yes, no problem, singles'. The next ball, Ronnie Irani pitches it up, he sits down and sweeps, right from the middle stump, it could have hit his pad, he was gone, it went for four, I did not go up to him. He did not even look at me because he understood. So he turned his face, took guard and batted again. The next ball he again hit him over covers for a four. So on five balls he hit five boundaries. And on the sixth ball he took a single and as he walking past me he said 'I've taken a single'. And this is happening in the middle, we got 22 runs that over, he smashed him, he was so good. I was furious at the other end because he did not listen to me.""Ganguly adds, ""I had two options, either I walk up in the middle and give him my piece of mind. So I took a couple of minutes, pulled myself back and I want up to him and said keep concentrating. I didn't tell him anything from thereon, he played an absolute blinder of a knock and we won. We finished the game, we won, and as I sat in this dressing room upstairs, he was sitting slightly far away from me, I kept thinking to myself, I said you know today you won this game because this gentleman at the other end just took the opposition bowler on. And what were you thinking of telling him? That be conservative, take a single, go to the next over, but he was one person who felt that he could hit him for 20 in that over and turned the game around. And I say this to all of you here because sometimes as a leader, when you work with different people, you have your own way of doing things. You have your own way of being successful and go and tell him, 'hey this is the way I think it's right, let's do it and we'll win that way. But there's this other person who's more talented, who's more gifted, who looks at things differently and probably has a better solution than you. And it was Sehwag that day who had a better solution than me. And it taught me a lot. We did win the game and it made me a better captain. And a couple of days later, I met him at breakfast and I said you know why did you do this? The first question he asked me 'Are you angry on me?' I said 'I was, I'm not anymore'. He said 'good'. I said I told you to take singles why did you hit him? He said 'I felt that was the best thing to do at that particular moment. That was the best thing I felt would win India the game at that particular moment.' And it was such a lesson for me on captaincy. I said I have a Sehwag who's different, I have a Dravid who's different, I have a Ganguly who's different and I have a Harbhajan Singh who's different. They can't play the same way. So if I have to be successful, I have to understand that they win cricket matches their way and I have to let them do that.""Ganguly continues, ""And I think a successful group, successful entrepreneur alongwith your aims and goals and objectives of wanting to be successful, don't forget this very simple line and solution in your journey is that everyone's different and you cannot make everyone play the same way or everyone work the same way. As long as he delivers for you, as a leader you need to have that capability of adjustment in you. And I say that when you manage individuals, you have to manage them differently. You cannot expect every individual to behave, react, work and do things the same way. That is very important in leadership.""Mohammad Kaif played a brilliant knock of 87 not out, he was well supported by Yuvraj Singh who scored 69 and both helped India script one of the most memorable wins in the history of the game.India were struggling at 146/5 when both Yuvraj and Kaif got together at the crease.The duo put on a partnership of 121 runs to give India a glimmer of hope in the match.Yuvraj was dismissed for 69 runs, but Kaif batted well, with tailenders, to give India a win in the final over by two wickets and with three balls to spare.Following the win, Ganguly had waived his T-shirt at the Lord's balcony - an image which is still fresh in the minds of all the cricket lovers in India.","Sourav Ganguly tells what he learned about leadership from his opening partner Virender Sehwag. Ganguly and his young team won the NatWest Trophy final against England, chasing down a steep target of 326 with three balls to spare at Lord's cricket ground.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111822160,imgsize-73518,width-400,resizemode-4/111822160.jpg"
Gautam Gambhir and Rohit Sharma prefer Suryakumar Yadav for Team India's T20I captaincy: Sources,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/gautam-gambhir-and-rohit-sharma-prefer-suryakumar-yadav-for-team-indias-t20i-captaincy-sources/articleshow/111812743.cms,"Hardik Pandya's numbers

Is Suryakumar better?

(All stats courtesy: Rajesh Kumar)

NEW DELHI: With Team India planning their strategies after their T20 World Cup 2024 victory and skipper Rohit Sharma 's retirement from T20Is, the discussion on the next captain is heating up.The two prominent candidates are Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav . However, recent reports indicate that Suryakumar may be preferred over Pandya. As per multiple reports, this preference arises mainly due to Pandya's inconsistent fitness record, which raises concerns about his suitability for long-term leadership.Sources reveal that both Gautam Gambhir , newly-appointed head coach, and T20 World Cup-winning captain Rohit Sharma favour Suryakumar for the captaincy role.It is also understood that Gambhir and chief selector Ajit Agarkar have already communicated this decision to Pandya.According to reports, Suryakumar will not only lead Team India in the upcoming T20I series against Sri Lanka, starting July 27, but will also be the Indian captain till the T20 World Cup 2026.In terms of Pandya's Indian Premier League ( IPL ) career, he debuted for Mumbai Indians in 2015. Pandya played 106 matches for Mumbai, scoring 1692 runs at an average of 25.63 with a strike rate of 152.43, including four fifties. For Gujarat Titans, he played 31 matches, scoring 833 runs at an average of 37.86 with a strike rate of 133.49, including six fifties.As a bowler, Pandya took 64 wickets in 137 matches with an average of 33.59. His best bowling figure was 3/17. As a captain, Pandya led in 45 matches, winning 26 with a winning percentage of 57.77. His captaincy performance, although decent with an IPL title with Gujarat Titans, hasn't overshadowed his fitness issues.On the other hand, Suryakumar's T20I record is impressive. Debuting in 2021, he has played 68 matches, scoring 2340 runs at an average of 43.33 and a strike rate of 167.74, including four centuries. In wins, his average rises to 46.72 with a strike rate of 174.29. As captain, Surya led India in seven matches, winning five with a winning percentage of 71.42.In the IPL, Surya has played 150 matches, scoring 3594 runs at an average of 32.08 with a strike rate of 145.32. His best year was 2023, where he scored 605 runs at an average of 43.21 with a strike rate of 181.13.With India set to announce the squad for the T20I series against Sri Lanka in the next few days, it is understood that Suryakumar, who is three years older than 30-year-old Pandya, seems better poised to captain the Indian side in the shortest format of the game.Meanwhile, the announcement of India's white-ball squads for the tour of Sri Lanka, which was expected on Wednesday, has reportedly been delayed and is now likely on Thursday.","Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav are the two prominent candidates.

I got him (out).So, that is a memorable moment. And even I saw the IPL season this year, he did really well there. Sometimes he is really aggressive, I saw it on TV. But I feel if he has to be a good coach, he needs to have some aggressiveness as well. Otherwise, you can't control the players. I think appointing him as a coach is a good decision,"" Perera told Star Sports.Another Sri Lankan veteran Angelo Mathews acknowledged Gambhir's fierce competitiveness and aggressive nature on the field. He stated, ""Gautam has always been a very fierce competitor, very aggressive. Even when batting, there are no giveaways from him. You need to fight against him all the time to get his wicket. And even on the field, he is just a great character. I wish him all the very best.""An outspoken personality, Gambhir has replaced the more reserved Rahul Dravid , with Dravid's tenure ending last month with India's T20 World Cup title victory.After his appointment, Gambhir posted on X: ""India is my identity and serving my country has been the greatest privilege of my life. I'm honoured to be back in a different role. My goal remains the same: to make every Indian proud. The men in blue shoulder the dreams of 1.4 billion Indians, and I will do everything to make these dreams come true!""Under his stewardship, India will play three T20 Internationals and three ODIs from July to August, starting with the T20Is at Pallekele on July 27, 28, and 30, before moving to Colombo for the ODIs on August 2, 4, and 7.","Former Sri Lankan international cricketer Thisara Perera has praised the appointment of Gautam Gambhir as the new head coach of the Indian men's cricket team.

NEW DELHI: Shubman Gill has been appointed as the vice-captain of the Indian cricket team for the upcoming T20I and ODI series against Sri Lanka, starting from July 27. This decision marks a significant leadership change, as Hardik Pandya , who was India's vice-captain during the recent T20 and ODI World Cups, has been replaced by the Gujarat Titans skipper.In the T20I squad, Gill will serve as the deputy to the newly appointed captain, Suryakumar Yadav , who has been entrusted with leading the team. Gill's appointment as vice-captain comes after his successful stint as the captain of the second-string Indian side that secured a 4-1 T20 series victory in Zimbabwe.For the ODI squad, where Suryakumar Yadav is not included, Gill will assume the role of vice-captain under the leadership of Rohit Sharma , who led India to victory in the T20 World Cup.Rohit will continue to captain the ODI team, which will play three matches against Sri Lanka in Colombo's R. Premadasa Stadium on August 2, 4, and 7.Virat Kohli will make his return to the ODI squad, while pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah remains absent from the tour after a demanding season.Rohit and Kohli had initially planned to take a break but decided to return for the ODI matches as India begin preparations for the upcoming Champions Trophy scheduled for next year in Pakistan.The decision to appoint Gill as the vice-captain over Hardik Pandya, who was Rohit's deputy in the T20 World Cup, is attributed to Pandya's frequent injury setbacks. Pandya remains part of the T20 squad but has been excluded from the ODI series, which will also see the return of Shreyas Iyer, who had previously lost his contract with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).Suryakumar Yadav (capt), Shubman Gill (vice-capt), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rinku Singh, Riyan Parag, Rishabh Pant (wk), Sanju Samson (wk), Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Ravi Bishnoi, Arshdeep Singh, Khaleel Ahmed, Mohammed SirajRohit Sharma (capt), Shubman Gill (vice-capt), Virat Kohli, KL Rahul (wk), Rishabh Pant (wk), Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Washington Sundar, Arshdeep Singh, Riyan Parag, Axar Patel, Khaleel Ahmed, Harshit Rana","Shubman Gill has been appointed as the vice-captain of the Indian cricket team for the upcoming T20I and ODI series against Sri Lanka.

I had the skills but Gautam bhai changed my mindset in KKR: Harshit Rana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/i-had-the-skills-but-gautam-bhai-changed-my-mindset-in-kkr-harshit-rana/articleshow/111842926.cms,"Top Picks For You Internet goes berserk after Ruturaj Gaikwad dropped from India's T20I squad for Sri Lanka series

NEW DELHI: Harshit Rana , a 22-year-old fast bowler from South Extension, Delhi, expressed his unwavering determination upon receiving his first call-up to the Indian ODI team , which includes renowned players like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma . In an emotional statement, he said, ""Delhi mein dil tooth sakta hai par humne kabhi hausla nahi haraa (Delhi can break your heart but I never lost hope).""Despite facing numerous setbacks and being overlooked during his journey from the junior levels, Rana's exceptional performance in the IPL, where he claimed 19 wickets and played a crucial role in Kolkata Knight Riders' victorious campaign, finally earned him recognition on the national stage.""I believed in working hard but whenever I used to get hurt after being overlooked in age-group teams, I would sit in my room and start sobbing. My father Pradeep never ever gave up hope.""If I have to name three people whom I am indebted to in this beautiful journey of mine, then it is my father for his efforts, my personal coach Amit Bhandari sir (former India and Delhi pacer) and above everyone else Gauti bhaiyya ( Gautam Gambhir ),"" Rana told PTI during an exclusive interaction on Thursday.""If my outlook towards the game has changed, a lot of it has got to do with Gauti bhaiyya's presence in the KKR dressing room and how he changed my mindset. At the elite level, you require skills but more than skills you require the heart to handle the pressure.""Gauti bhaiyya would always tell me 'Mere ko tere pe trust hai. Tu match jeetake aayega'. (I trust you, you can win the match),"" Rana recalled his interactions with the new India head coach.In 2022, he began on a positive trajectory, featuring in seven Ranji Trophy matches for Delhi and securing 28 wickets. Unfortunately, subsequent injuries hindered his participation in numerous red ball fixtures.Nevertheless, he has showcased exceptional prowess in white ball cricket for Delhi during the Vijay Hazare Trophy , claiming 22 wickets in 14 games and 28 in 25 T20 matches.Performing at the iconic Eden Gardens stadium, packed with a roaring crowd of 60,000 spectators, the bowler executed his arsenal of deliveries with precision. He consistently hit the blockhole, fired wide yorkers, and deceived batsmen with cleverly disguised slow bouncers. So how has he managed to back his skills under pressure?""If you ask about the pressure part it is Gautam Gambhir's advice. He would say, 'what's the worst thing that will happen? You will get hit and we can lose the match. But if you don't face your fears, how will you overcome them'?""There will always be a new day, a new match and things will fall in place. That's what you train for,"" said the lanky player, who had trained under Bhandari and Narinder Singh Negi in Delhi's Players' Academy.""If you talk about skill-set, then Bhandai sir and Negi sir have been my personal coaches for the past two years,"" he added.Bhandari, a seasoned cricketer from Delhi who represented India in a handful of ODIs from 2000 to 2004, shared a fascinating tale. He recounted an incident that shed light on an intriguing aspect of his cricketing journey.""I didn't know who this boy was. In fact, when he came to me, he had not played for KKR but had played Ranji Trophy. He only called me up and said, 'sir, can you train me?',"" Bhandari, who is an assistant coach with Gujarat Titans, remembered their first meeting.""First day he came, I didn't give him a new ball but an old ball and told him the areas with instructions. Just bowl and don't look at me or come to me. If I feel like it, I will call you.""Bhandari was impressed enough to start working on the bowler.""What I saw was a nice run-up but once he reached the crease, after load-up, everything needed a bit of work. The non-bowling hand, alignment and he was ready to work,"" he said.Bhandari believes Rana possesses the necessary skills and abilities to excel in international competitions.""In Delhi, you always hear about corruption, groupism, nepotism. Now look at the bonafide Delhi greats. Most have within two years of Delhi debut played for India.""Viru (Sehwag), Gauti (Gambhir), Ishant (Sharma), Rishabh (Pant) all had talent and didn't hover around domestic cricket for long. If you are a talented Delhi cricketer, the system can't stop you. And if you aren't, then even in 15 years, you won't make it,"" Bhandari said.","Harshit Rana, a 22-year-old fast bowler from South Extension, Delhi, has been called up to the Indian ODI team. Rana's exceptional performance in the IPL, where he claimed 19 wickets and played a crucial role in Kolkata Knight Riders' victorious campaign, finally earned him recognition.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111842910,imgsize-28908,width-400,resizemode-4/111842910.jpg"

Whenever we go and play, we always want to play good cricket and we will follow the same method,"" Harmanpreet said on the eve of their opener.Pakistan captain Nida Dar is well aware of India's prowess in the sport. As her team prepares to face their rivals, she acknowledges the opportunity to gain valuable insights from the Indian side.""We just wanted to play against India because we had some good experiences and the way they are playing is great. Their approach in T20 is great, we have seen their approach. So this series is very important as at least we can learn from them,"" Dar said.Besides India and Pakistan, other participating teams in this edition of the tournament are hosts Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Nepal, Thailand and United Arab Emirates.","India's women's cricket team is gearing up for the Women's Asia Cup.

England's innings concluded at 477 with skipper Hamza Shaikh also registering a ton, scoring 107 runs.In recent times, Flintoff's reputation has been growing rapidly, particularly after he achieved the distinction of being the third-youngest cricketer to reach a hundred in the Second Eleven Championship in April.This feat saw him surpass his father's long-standing record for Lancashire, which had remained unbroken for three decades.Last month, 16-year-old Flintoff signed his first professional contract with the county. He also represented the England Under-19 one-day international team in a three-match series against Sri Lanka.Flintoff's father, Andrew, was one of cricket's greatest all-rounders, amassing over 7,000 runs and nearly 400 wickets in Tests and ODIs.Andrew Flintoff was England's hero in the 2005 Ashes series against Australia, where his 402 runs and 24 wickets played a crucial role in England's 2-1 victory.In that series, the team was captained by Michael Vaughan , whose 18-year-old son, Archie Vaughan, is now playing alongside Flintoff in the Test against Sri Lanka.",16-year-old Rocky Flintoff becomes youngest player to score a century for England's Under-19 team in a Test match against Sri Lanka.

He proved to be a valuable asset to the team with his bowling prowess, both in the Powerplay and death overs.Not only did Axar excel with the ball, but he also made significant contributions with the bat.Axar played a vital knock of 47 in the final against South Africa. However, his bowling performance was subpar, as Heinrich Klaasen took advantage of his deliveries, resulting in Axar conceding 49 runs in his allocated 4 overs.In an exclusive interview with Cricbuzz, Axar shared his experiences from the match where Klaasen launched a brutal assault on him. The left-arm spinner revealed how captain Rohit Sharma played a crucial role in keeping his spirits high, even as Klaasen took him to task.""In the final, when Heinrich Klaasen was aggressive against me, Rohit approached me and reassured me, saying, 'It's alright. You bowled your best. If he hits a good shot, there's not much you can do. Just focus on the next ball.' His support and encouragement boosted my confidence. After I completed the over, he tapped my shoulder and said, 'Well done. Don't worry.' Such conversations from your captain lift you and keep you motivated on the field. Rohit excels in providing that kind of support,"" he told Cricbuzz.Axar commended Rohit for his shrewd leadership during the T20 World Cup, noting how he effectively managed the team and extracted the best performances from each individual player.""Rohit Sharma is a brilliant captain. If you observed his captaincy during the World Cup, you wouldn't find a set formula. In some games, I bowled two overs in the PowerPlay, while in others, Jasprit Bumrah bowled early. There wasn't a specific pattern. Similarly, in batting, I didn't always move up the order. In the final, Shivam Dube batted ahead of Hardik Pandya . It was all very tactical, showcasing his ability to think strategically in different situations, determining which player would perform best.""""I believe Rohit had done his homework. Throughout the World Cup, he brought out the best in each player. For instance, in the England game, he sent Ravindra Jadeja ahead of me and Dube, displaying an incredible presence of mind. Even in the final, Bumrah completed his overs by the 18th over (normally he bowls the 19th over). There were numerous such instances where his skill in rotating bowlers effectively contributed to the result. It's something that comes with experience I guess. He understands each player's strengths and utilizes them according to the game's demands. Winning five IPL titles isn't coincidental,"" he added.","Axar Patel was the most valuable player in India's T20 World Cup campaign.

Dortmund eye fresh start under new Turkish coach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/dortmund-eye-fresh-start-under-new-turkish-coach/articleshow/111843336.cms,"New manager, new ambition

Rebuilding for the future

It's been a case of so close yet so far for Borussia Dortmund in the last couple of seasons. While 2022-23 saw them finishing second to Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga on the last day of the season, the last season culminated in a Champions League final heartbreak with Real Madrid beating them 2-0 in the final. What made it more difficult for the Dortmund fans was the fact that the German giants, who were playing the Champions League final after 10 years, were the better team for long parts of the final.Now, as Borussia Dortmund embark on a new season, a few things have changed.Talisman Marco Reus has left the club after 12 years, stalwart defender Mats Hummels has also moved on. Influential striker Niklas Fullkrug, too, is also likely to join AC Milan while, most significantly, manager Edin Terzic has left his post.Considered the best bet to lead the club to the summit, Terzic left many shocked when he departed after two-and-a-half seasons. But the appointment of Nuri Sahin came as a pleasant surprise. As a former academy and first-team player, Sahin is well-known amongst the ‘black-and-yellow' faithful. In his first speech as manager, Sahin made it clear that his primary objective is to bring the German giants back to where they belong. Dortmund last won the Bundesliga title in 2011-12 and have suffered multiple heartbreaks in the league and European cup competitions – their last silverware came in 2021 when they won the DFB-Pokal.""From day one, we will work with great passion and energy to make the club as successful as possible."" The Turkish manager has his hands full as he will be looking to rebuild the team as it prepares for Bundesliga and Champions League.If we were to reflect on the past, Dortmund hardly made statement signings. ‘Die Schwarzgelben' have always been a club built around developing players. Dortmund have also been smart off the field and have relied on talented young players in the transfer market, traditionally selling them to the powerhouses for a significant sum of money.However, the club does not have the Haalands, Bellinghams or Pulisics it once did. Jamie Bynoe-Gittens has shown promise and could have the X-factor that Dortmund may require, but a relatively poor finish to the season leaves a lot to be desired in the new term.Since senior figures like Hummels and Reus have departed, Dortmund are without leaders in the dressing room. The club has signed Serhou Guirassy following his impressive 28-goal campaign with VFB Stuttgart. The club will hope that he brings his end product and build-up play, areas which Dortmund lacked last season. Nico Schlotterbeck and Julian Ryerson will be retained in the back line, but with Ian Maatsen's loan ending, Dortmund's defence looks fragile.With Maatsen and Hummels no longer in the setup, Dortmund will turn to the recent signing of Waldemar Anton to deliver consistent performances. They do have Niklas Sule and Ramy Bensebaini, who weren't a part of the first-choice defensive line last campaign, but it will be interesting to see if they become starters next season.",Borussia Dortmund finished second in the Bundesliga last season. The German giants lost to Real Madrid in the Champions League final. Manager Edin Terzic left the club after two-and-a-half seasons.

Prior to him, footballers Gautam Sarkar (2023) and Shyam Thapa (2022) were awarded the same.While Mohun Bagan's awards ceremony is traditionally held on July 29 in honour of the club's historic IFA Shield triumph in 1911, East Bengal observes the club's foundation day two days later, on August 1.For other Mohun Bagan awards this year, Australian forward Dimitri Petratos has been named the best football player (senior) while Manvir Singh will receive the best striker's award for the 2023-2024 season.The senior team of Mohun Bagan SG under their new coach Jose Molina has also planned to kick-start its pre-season on July 29, two days after they are scheduled to begin their Durand Cup title defence with a match against Downtown Heroes FC.Mohun Bagan Ratna: Sourav GangulyLifetime Achievement Award: Bimal MukherjeeBest footballer (senior): Dimitri PetratosBest striker: Manvir SinghBest youth footballer: Suhail BhatBest cricketer: Avilin GhoshBest athlete: Karunamoy MahatoBest hockey player: Sourabh PashineBharat Gaurav: Sourav Ganguly",Mohun Bagan club's executive committee on Wednesday chose the former India captain and BCCI president's name for the club's highest award.

PANAJI:

The All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) has started contacting coaches who had applied for the national team vacancy and will start the interview process, based on the feedback it receives.According to an email sent out by acting general secretary M Satyanarayan, the AIFF is looking at several applications and needs additional details “to make an informed decision, before moving to the next stage of the selection process.”The details that the AIFF has sought includes: “Are you still interested in the job? What is the minimum package you are expecting in terms of monthly salary and other benefits? How soon can you take up the assignment, if selected? Any other information or demands you may have.”According to sources, emails have been sent to a dozen-odd coaches from the 291 who had applied with at least two Indian Super League (ISL) winning coaches – Manolo Marquez and Antonio Lopez Habas – among those who have been lined up for an interview. Park Hang-seo, the man who took Vietnam from no-hopers in 2017 to the quarterfinals of the AFC Asian Cup where they eventually lost by a solitary goal against Japan, has also been contacted.“There is growing feeling within the federation that the next national team coach has to be someone with good knowledge about Indian football,” a source told TOI on Wednesday. “Manolo and Habas have spent considerable time in India and will have an advantage in the selection process. Their success rate in India is good. The federation is only wary about salaries, given that it may have to compensate (former national team coach) Igor Stimac for unilaterally terminating the contract.”No coach has managed more games (110) in the ISL than Habas and he remains the most successful coach in the ISL as well. The Spaniard has won two ISL titles (one each with Atletico de Kolkata and ATK) and one League Shield (with Mohun Bagan last season) during his time in India.Manolo, on the other hand, took Hyderabad from the bottom in 2020 when he took charge of the team, to the ISL trophy in 2022, and has produced a significant number of players for the national team which includes big guns like Akash Mishra, Nikhil Poojary, Ashish Rai, Mohamed Yasir, Liston Colaco, Hitesh Sharma and Jay Gupta.He has managed 90 matches in the ISL, and except for his debut (2020-21), has challenged for the coveted Shield in three of his four seasons in India. While on debut he missed qualification by a whisker with Hyderabad, he finished second on the league table twice and third last season with FC Goa.After sacking Stimac for his failure to guide India to the third round of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers, despite an encouraging start, AIFF called for applications from coaches with minimum 10-15 years of experience at the elite youth and senior level.The federation received a total of 291 applications.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has started contacting coaches who had applied for the national team vacancy.
