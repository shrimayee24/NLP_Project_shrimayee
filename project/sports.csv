Why the Milwaukee Bucks Consider It

Risks for Both Sides

Could thepull off a massive trade to pair Luka Dončić with? After a disappointing playoff exit, the Lakers are exploring bold moves to rebuild their championship-contending roster. One potential blockbuster deal could bring the two-time MVP to Los Angeles, reshaping the NBA landscape.The Los Angeles Lakers’ early playoff departure at the hands of the Minnesota Timberwolves has forced the front office into a critical offseason. With Luka Dončić’s future uncertain beyond next season and LeBron James nearing retirement, general manager Rob Pelinka faces tough decisions.The team must choose between:- Building depth around Dončić and James.- Swinging for a third superstar to form a historic trio.A proposed trade by Colby Faria of the Sporting News could deliver Giannis Antetokounmpo, giving the Los Angeles Lakers one of the most dominant duos in NBA history.Here’s how the deal could work:- Instant Championship Window: Pairing Dončić and Giannis Antetokounmpo would create an unstoppable pick-and-roll duo.- LeBron’s Last Ride: James may delay retirement for a shot at a fifth title.- Long-Term Star Power: Secures a future cornerstone if Dončić stays.- Draft Capital: Multiple unprotected picks offer flexibility for a rebuild.- Young Talent: Reaves and Knecht provide immediate contributors.- Financial Relief: Moves off Giannis’ supermax for future flexibility.While the trade is enticing, there are potential pitfalls:- For the Lakers: If the gamble fails, Dončić could leave in 2026, leaving the team in a full rebuild.- For the Bucks: Trading a franchise icon risks alienating fans unless the return yields future success.As analyst Colby Faria noted: ""If Giannis Antetokounmpo ended up with the Lakers, it would create one of the most talented duos in NBA history between he and Luka Dončić.""Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors could eye $70 million Boston Celtics point guard to boster squad after unfortunate playoff exit The Lakers’ front office must weigh short-term glory against long-term stability.

His poor shot selection in such a crucial game only amplified the backlash.While Pant flopped once again, Mitchell Marsh (65) and Aiden Markram (61) had given SRH a flying start, hammering the LSG bowlers in the powerplay.Despite efforts from Nicholas Pooran (45) to push the total beyond 200, LSG's momentum dipped sharply in the middle overs.With the playoff race heating up, every decision and every dismissal carries weight.

Jayson Tatum's Injury and Financial Constraints Prompt Potential Roster Overhaul

The Boston Celtics are said to be contemplating a trade involving Derrick White , a crucial player in their recent title run. This comes shortly after Jayson Tatum's unfortunate Achilles injury, which has put the team's future in jeopardy. Although White has been a key asset, recognized with an All-Defensive Second Team selection and a four-year, $125.9 million extension signed in July 2024, the Celtics are exploring various strategies to address their financial challenges and remain competitive.The Boston Celtics just got knocked out of the playoffs, and with Tatum hurt, they're taking a hard look at their lineup. They've got a hefty salary cap situation, especially with Tatum's massive contract, which makes things tricky. Word is, Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis might be up for trade too, but White's age and contract make him a more likely candidate to be moved.Derrick White's time with the Celtics has been filled with major milestones. He was key in their championship win in 2024, making important contributions on both ends of the court. His playoff stats, averaging 16.7 points per game, highlighted how valuable he is to the squad. Still, with the Celtics investing heavily in Tatum, Brown, and others, discussions about extending White's contract have gotten a bit tricky.There's a buzz around trade rumors, especially with the Pistons and Warriors in the mix. The Pistons are eyeing a deal that could involve Jaden Ivey and some draft picks, and the Warriors are keen if the Celtics start making big changes. This indicates the Celtics are open to all possibilities for reworking their lineup.Although there's a lot of talk, some analysts argue that letting go of White might not be the best call for the team.

Judge calls out scandalous legal tactics in high-profile Hollywood dispute

Taylor Swift’s private world gets dragged into the spotlight — again

Rift between Swift and Lively threatens long-standing friendship

A recent federal court decision may bring a welcome sigh of relief to pop icon Taylor Swift and NFL star Travis Kelce , as a judge moves to tamp down escalating legal drama that risked pulling the couple deeper into controversy. The dispute centers around a harassment case involving actor Justin Baldoni and actress Blake Lively — a close friend of Swift — which has now taken an unexpected turn with Swift’s name being thrust into the spotlight.U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman issued a strong rebuke this week, striking from the court record a letter that accused Blake Lively’s legal team of attempting to coerce Swift into making a public statement supporting Lively.The letter, written by attorney Bryan Freedman on behalf of Baldoni, alleged that Lively had threatened to release private text messages unless Swift voiced her support — a claim that Judge Liman deemed potentially libelous and lacking merit. The judge warned against “legal maneuvering” designed to ""promote scandal"" and emphasized the importance of focusing on the facts rather than stirring public drama.Taylor Swift, who skyrocketed into NFL relevance thanks to her high-profile romance with Kelce, was reportedly “really hurt” after being implicated in the legal mess. According to PEOPLE reporters Benjamin VanHoose and Sean Mandell, a source revealed that Swift and Lively were attempting to move past the situation, though recent legal moves appear to have reopened emotional wounds.The same report cited an earlier complaint filed by Baldoni, which noted that Lively had allegedly referred to Swift as one of her “dragons” in a text exchange — a cryptic and telling descriptor that may hint at deeper tensions between the two friends.“Their friendship has halted,” PEOPLE reported. “Taylor wants no part in this (Lively) drama.” The fallout is especially poignant given that Swift is the godmother to Lively’s four children with husband Ryan Reynolds.A source close to the ongoing case added that a recent subpoena “fractured” the “fragile peace” between the two women, potentially ending a high-profile Hollywood friendship that once seemed unbreakable.Also Read: Donald Trump vs. Taylor Swift feud takes a toxic turn: Is it tearing apart Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes’ longstanding NFL brotherhood?

Aaron Rodgers to Steelers a done deal already?

(Credit: Getty Images)

Insider who penned Aaron Rodgers’ life says Pittsburgh could soon land the legendary QB



The Pittsburgh Steelers might be on the cusp of one of the most fascinating quarterback acquisitions in recent NFL memory. As the Aaron Rodgers saga unfolds, fans and insiders alike are bracing for what could be a transformative chapter in both the franchise's future and Rodgers' storied career. According to Out of the Darkness author Ian O’Connor—Rodgers' biographer and longtime friend—there’s a strong belief that a deal is imminent, and it could all culminate before the start of the Steelers’ mandatory minicamp.“I do think there will be a happy ending, at least for him and we will find out for the Steelers and their fan base,” O'Connor shared in a recent appearance on 93.7 The Fan. “If I had $100 to put down, my feeling is he will be in uniform June 10th, for the start of the mandatory minicamp.”O’Connor’s insights carry weight. He interviewed more than 250 individuals for his 2024 biography on Rodgers and maintains close ties with the quarterback. His conviction about the move isn’t rooted in guesswork—it's shaped by Rodgers’ own behind-the-scenes messaging to Pittsburgh. O’Connor mentioned that Rodgers has signaled his intent to play for the Steelers but has been delaying the official move due to unresolved personal matters.“He’s told [the Steelers], ‘Listen, I’m gonna play for you. I just don’t want to go there and then miss part of mandatory minicamp because of my personal issues. I’m pretty sure they’re gonna be solved by the end of May, at least in my satisfaction where I can give you my all,’” O’Connor explained.These personal issues, which Rodgers acknowledged in his only public remarks this offseason, reportedly involve someone close to him. While O’Connor opted not to reveal specifics, he clarified, “The sense I got was, I think I have a pretty good sense of what it is, and I don’t think it’s something that would prevent him from playing football.”From a football standpoint, Rodgers would be a clear upgrade for the Steelers, especially over Mason Rudolph. While Pittsburgh’s offense may not be overflowing with elite talent, Rodgers is the type of quarterback who can elevate the players around him. With weapons like DK Metcalf, Pat Freiermuth, Calvin Austin, and Robert Woods, the veteran’s presence could unlock a new dimension for the Steelers’ attack.O'Connor is optimistic—not just about the fit, but about the outcome. “Do I think the Steelers are going to win the Super Bowl? No, but if you told me 11-6 with at least one playoff victory, the first with that franchise since 2016, I think that's realistic. I think that this could be a success story, and certainly a worthy ending for him.”For Rodgers, a move to Pittsburgh wouldn’t just be about chasing a Super Bowl. It would be about redemption. His brief, injury-marred stint with the Jets was widely viewed as a disappointment. “He knows it was an embarrassment in New York largely, and he’s the face of that embarrassment,” O’Connor said. A strong run in Pittsburgh could rewrite the narrative and offer Rodgers a satisfying final act—one that proves Act II wasn’t his final bow.With OTAs set to begin in just over a week and the 2025 NFL schedule now revealed, timing seems to be aligning perfectly. If the deal materializes, expect a press conference in Pittsburgh soon—ushering in what might be Rodgers' last, and potentially most poetic, NFL chapter.Also Read: Eagles star calls Ivanka Trump “beautiful,” and she responds with a special locker room message","Ian O'Connor, Aaron Rodgers' biographer, believes a deal is imminent.

'Chances are still there': Abishek Porel believes in IPL 2025 playoff miracle

NEW DELHI: The IPL 2025 showdown between Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) lit up with drama as tensions boiled over between spinner Digvesh Rathi and SRH opener Abhishek Sharma during the eighth over of a pulsating run chase.The flashpoint came when Rathi dismissed a blazing Abhishek, who had hammered 59 off just 20 balls in a ferocious assault on the LSG bowlers. Attempting to launch a wide googly over the off-side, Abhishek mistimed the shot and sliced it to sweeper cover, where Shardul Thakur held onto a sharp running catch.What should have been a moment of triumph quickly turned confrontational.Rathi, known for his flamboyant ""book-sign"" celebration, unleashed it once more after the crucial breakthrough. However, the gesture didn’t sit well with Abhishek. Visibly agitated, the southpaw exchanged heated words with Rathi, prompting the umpires and teammates to intervene and cool tempers.In a video that quickly went viral, Abhishek can be seen mouthing to Rathi while walking back to the pavilion: “Teri choti pakad ke marunga” — “I'll grab your braid and beat you up.”At the time of the dismissal, SRH were flying high at 99 runs, seemingly on course to chase down LSG’s formidable 205-run total. Abhishek’s fiery innings, studded with four boundaries and six massive sixes, had given Hyderabad the perfect launchpad.Earlier in the contest, Mitchell Marsh (65) and Aiden Markram (61) laid a solid foundation for LSG with explosive half-centuries. The innings stuttered in the middle overs after skipper Rishabh Pant ’s departure for just 7, but Nicholas Pooran’s late fireworks — a 45-run blitz off 26 balls — propelled LSG past the 200-run mark.While the match had its fair share of fireworks, it was the Abhishek-Rathi spat that grabbed the spotlight. Fans flooded social media with reactions and clips, turning the heated exchange into one of the most talked-about moments of the IPL season.","IPL 2025 showdown between Lucknow Super Giants and Sunrisers Hyderabad lit up with drama.

A respectful goodbye to Paul Mullin by Wrexham co-owner

Thoughtful send-off by Ryan Reynolds

Paul Mullin's legacy continues

With the club now preparing for its inaugural season in the Championship, co-owner Ryan Reynolds is reported to be considering a farewell for one of the club's leading player, Paul Mullin. Having been so instrumental in Wrexham's back-to-back promotions, Mullin has elevated beyond the goal scorer tag and into a symbol of the team's metamorphosis and a supporter favourite. Rumours of an exit have gained momentum, and Reynolds is now expected to give a gesture that displays the club's and owners' deep respect for him.It seems like the end of an emotional journey for Mullin in Wrexham. Despite having a contract till 2026, changes in the squad and non-considerable appearances have stirred the waters for a potential summer departure.Sources close to the club hold that Wrexham might allow Mullin to move on without demanding anything for a transfer - an act of respect and goodwill rather than business. Few players have shaped the club so dramatically in recent times, particularly after aiding the club out of the National League into League Two and now into the Championship.Ryan Reynolds, known for doing everything from the ground up with players or having a great relationship with them, is said to have planned a tribute to Paul Mullin for his contributions. Of course, the details remain under wraps, but it is clear that Reynolds wants to give Mullins proper recognition for his contribution on and off the pitch.This is not the first time Reynolds has gone out of his way in trying to honour the club's own, and it is an endorsement of how deeply he and co-owner Rob McElhenney have gotten themselves into Wrexham.Arriving at Wrexham in 2021, Paul Mullin soon became the heart of the team's attacking line. His goalscoring records and tireless efforts kept Wrexham's climb upward, whereas his influence was much larger than that. Mullin was known for issues beyond football, including speaking out on social matters like autism awareness since his son is on the spectrum. Mullin became one of the speakers for the community.Also Read: Vegas party over: Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney axe 8 Wrexham players days after lavish promotion bash With the club already set to face a new challenge in the Championship, Mullin's legacies are already secured.

But despite his last name carrying the weight of a sports empire, Ty never came close to donning an NHL jersey — and few seem to talk about why.Ty Gretzky laced up his skates with the same passion many young Canadians do. But unlike most, his every move was scrutinized. Coaches, scouts, and fans often judged him not as a young player with potential, but as Wayne Gretzky’s son — a comparison no teenager could realistically live up to. As a result, Ty’s hockey development took place in the long shadow of a living legend, which may have stunted rather than supported his path.It’s easy to assume that Ty would get a shot at the NHL just based on the marketing potential alone. But the league never called — not even for a low-risk camp invite. And that raises a question the hockey world tends to avoid: did NHL executives quietly agree he simply didn’t have the talent, or were they wary of the media circus that would follow?While Ty played briefly in junior leagues, including a stint with the Shattuck-St. Mary’s prep school — a pipeline for future pros — his performances were modest. There were no breakout seasons, no jaw-dropping stats. Scouts remained silent. Teams passed him over year after year.Unlike other sports where legacy can open doors, the NHL prides itself on merit. Nepotism rarely flies in a league where every inch of ice is earned. In that sense, Ty Gretzky may be a rare case: the son of greatness who couldn’t buy his way into the league — even if others in his shoes might have tried.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's son Ty Gretzky shows favouritism, backs Rick Tocchet's return as Flyers head coach with enthusiastic message In the end, Ty chose his own path, leaving hockey behind to pursue entrepreneurship and media. But the question still lingers: did the NHL ignore Ty because he wasn’t good enough — or because he was too much of a Gretzky?","Ty Gretzky is the eldest son of NHL icon Wayne Gretzki.

After weeks of stirring performances and highly charged moments, American Idol has finally crowned its Season 23 winner. On the evening of May 18, the crown was given to Jamal Roberts , a physical education teacher from Meridian, Mississippi. Roberts won the series finale against fellow finalists John Foster and Breanna Nix, who finished second and third, respectively.The news was delivered by veteran host Ryan Seacrest in one of the most emotional moments of the season. However, Jamal's win is about so much more than singing ability. It is a testament to determination, core values, and a quest to make a difference.American Idol 2025 has named its season 23 winner, Jamal Roberts. Familiar for his rich vocals and compelling background, Roberts had audiences spellbound throughout the season. From Meridian, Mississippi, his path not only demonstrated his ability but his commitment to family, community, and having a positive influence. Prior to his American Idol experience, Roberts had already seen the competitive landscape of television performance. He already made it to the Top 3 on BET's Sunday Best, a gospel music show that prepared him with the grit he would need on the larger national stage.""Sunday Best taught me to persevere when the heat is on,"" Roberts revealed in a backstage interview. ""It gave me tough skin, and that was a real prep for Idol.""That preparation served her well over the course of the season, as Roberts consistently delivered emotionally powerful performances that both impressed the judges and won the hearts of the public.Roberts' attachment to his hometown of Meridian, Mississippi was a constant theme during his American Idol experience. When he auditioned for the first time, he openly discussed the issues in his community, such as crime and economic struggle. But instead of focusing on hardship, he decided to be a hope provider.""This is where I grew up,"" he said. ""It can be a whole lot better than it is. So, I'm praying that I can bring a little light to it.""That spotlight, Roberts feels, starts in the house. A devoted father to three daughters—Harmoni, Lyrik, and Gianna—his drive to succeed was as much personal as it was professional. His youngest daughter, Gianna, was born a few days before a live show taping in Los Angeles. While the emotional sacrifice of being apart from his family was significant, their encouragement remained his push. They've been with me through it all,"" he said. ""I drew strength from seeing their faces in the crowd every time I went on stage.""What distinguishes Jamal Roberts is not merely his voice talent—it's the message in the music. As a schoolteacher, father, and community leader, Roberts represents a new breed of artist: one who harnesses their platform for the purpose of inspiring others and sparking useful conversation.During the competition, his narrative struck a chord across the country. He was not only a performer to audiences, but a man who was genuinely passionate about his principles—someone capable of reconciling ambition and humility.""Jamal is the type of artist the world needs today,"" one judge said during the final. ""His voice speaks to the heart, but his story speaks to life.""With Season 23 of American Idol now over, fans are looking to see what the future holds for Roberts. His victory paves the way for recording contracts, national tours, and other music industry opportunities. However, Roberts stays true to himself. ""I want to use this moment to show my students and my daughters that dreams really can come true,"" he said. ""But it takes faith, work, and a whole lot of heart.""National fame is not all that Roberts will gain, however. In addition to his newfound celebrity status, he will also get a cash prize of $125,000, according to the reports. Though the money is a big incentive, it's apparent that to Jamal Roberts, the real reward is the potential to influence and touch lives.","Jamal Roberts, a physical education teacher from Meridian, Mississippi, won season 23 of American Idol.

Melinda French Gates’ dream which changed her life

Melinda Gates says she suffered panic attacks

Microsoft founder Bill Gates ex-wife Melinda French Gates has revealed that a recurring dream played an important role in her decision to end her 27-year marriage. The divorce, which was finalised in 2021, followed the surfacing of certain information that impacted the couple's relationship. In a recent interview Melinda French Gates revealed that she experienced recurring nightmares in late 2019. She claimed that the dream turned out be a turning point in her journey.In an interview with enterprenuer Jamie Kern Lima, French Gates described her symbolic dream. Melinda French Gates described that in her dream, she saw that she was standing on a cliff along with Bill Gates and their children. As the dream progressed, the portion of the cliff where she stood began to crumble and break away. This imagery had a profound effect on her, which she interpreted as a clear sign that she needed to separate from Bill and move forward on her own.“I was going to have to make a decision—and I was going to have to make it by myself,” she recalled.""Some dreams will take me years to understand, but if they’re recurring, I know I need to pay attention to them,” added Melinda Gates.While the dream served as a catalyst, Melinda's decision was also influenced by other factors. While she did not disclose specific details, Melinda acknowledged that certain things came out publicly, reinforcing her decision to leave the marriage. She referenced Bill Gates’ past meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, which she described as deeply disturbing. Bill has previously admitted that associating with Epstein was a mistake.In a recent candid interview with The Times, French Gates addressed Bill Gates’ remarks about their divorce. She said, “If you can’t live your values out inside your most intimate relationship, it was necessary.”French Gates also opened up about the emotional strain of the divorce, sharing that she experienced panic attacks throughout the separation. “When you’re leaving a marriage, it’s very, very hard. And the negotiations were tough,” she said.She shared that her first panic attack occurred in 2014 while having lunch with Gates, prompting her to begin therapy. “I’d heard of people having panic attacks and I didn’t know if it was a real thing,” she said.Initially skeptical of therapy, French Gates admitted she later came to understand its value. “It doesn’t mean I’m damaged,” she explained. “It means I’ve been through some difficult things that I need to figure out.”Following the divorce, both Bill and Melinda Gates have continued their philanthropic efforts, though they are no longer working together as a couple. Bill Gates has publicly expressed regret about the divorce, acknowledging his role in the dissolution of their marriage.","Melinda French Gates has revealed that a recurring dream played an important role in her decision to end her 27-year marriage to Bill Gates.

ESPN projection sparks concern over McCarthy’s readiness in Vikings system



Bucky Brooks Dropped the Most Accurate JJ McCarthy Piece Ever

O’Connell’s track record offers hope but McCarthy’s inexperience remains major risk



The Minnesota Vikings have placed their future in the hands of rookie quarterback J.J. McCarthy but the road ahead might not be as smooth as fans hope. ESPN’s Mike Clay recently released his 2025 season projections, and McCarthy finds himself at the top of a list no rookie wants to lead: interceptions. Despite a disciplined college career, the former Michigan standout is projected to struggle with turnovers in his first NFL campaign.According to Clay’s widely-followed NFL forecast, McCarthy is expected to throw a league-high 14 interceptions in 2025, more than any rookie or veteran QB in the league. He’s slotted above a group tied at 12 picks, including Sam Darnold, Cam Ward, Anthony Richardson, and Tyler Shough. While Clay also predicts 3,705 passing yards and 24 touchdowns for McCarthy, the interception count stands out and raises serious questions about the rookie’s transition to the pros.What’s puzzling is how this contrasts with McCarthy’s college numbers. At Michigan, he was known for protecting the football, just 12 interceptions across 713 attempts in three years under Jim Harbaugh. So why the sudden spike? Clay’s projections seem to suggest that NFL speed, complex defenses, and high-pressure situations could rattle even the most polished college prospects.Head coach Kevin O’Connell, often praised as a quarterback developer, helped reduce Sam Darnold’s turnovers last season — Darnold threw only three interceptions after Week 11. Still, unlike Darnold, McCarthy hasn’t played a single NFL down. No amount of mental reps behind Darnold and Daniel Jones can fully prepare him for real-time defensive pressure in live action.Also Read: Russell Wilson’s New York Giants journey after Steelers trade: QB gears up to conquer the city that never sleeps With a 15-game projection to account for possible injuries or rotational changes, McCarthy’s forecast is more than just speculation, it's a warning. If the Vikings can’t get ahead of the turnover issue early, the rookie may find himself under fire from both opposing defenses and Minnesota’s passionate fanbase. The talent is there, but if turnovers become the headline, J.J. McCarthy’s rookie campaign could test the patience of a franchise desperately seeking stability under center.",J.J.

'Shubman Gill used his brains a lot more than the other guys'

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming finally addressed the elephant in the room, MS Dhoni ’s IPL future, but gave little away.""I don’t know,"" said Fleming during the pre-match press conference at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Monday, leaving fans and pundits guessing about whether the 43-year-old legendary captain has played his final IPL season.As Chennai Super Kings prepare to face Rajasthan Royals in their final match of the IPL 2025 season, the focus has shifted from results to rebuilding.It’s been a season to forget for the five-time champions, marred by inconsistency and underwhelming performances across departments.However, amid the disappointment, silver linings have emerged: none brighter than 17-year-old Ayush Mhatre.The young opener’s fearless approach and ability to score quickly in the powerplay have given CSK hope for the future.With Mhatre, along with Dewald Brevis, Urvil Patel, and Shaik Rasheed stepping up, CSK are beginning to look ahead, possibly to a post-Dhoni era, one still not officially confirmed yet.The match at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, a neutral venue per the revised schedule, gives these youngsters one more chance to stake their claim.On the other hand, Rajasthan Royals are limping toward the finish line.Despite boasting talent like Yashasvi Jaiswal and promising youngster Vaibhav Suryavanshi, RR's campaign has collapsed under poor decisions, particularly in last year's auction.Letting go of Jos Buttler and banking heavily on unproven Indian talent, combined with the lack of a frontline Indian bowler or a dependable all-rounder, has cost them dearly.With only one win while chasing in nine attempts, Rajasthan’s failure to finish games has become their defining trait this season.Both teams may be out of contention, but for CSK, the focus is firmly on what lies ahead, with or without MS Dhoni.","Chennai Super Kings prepare to face Rajasthan Royals in their final match of the IPL 2025 season.

IPL: Sunil Joshi hails Harpreet Brar’s impact as Punjab Kings down Rajasthan Royals

NEW DELHI: Former champions Gujarat Titans stormed into the IPL 2025 playoffs in style, registering a dominant 10-wicket victory over Delhi Capitals on Sunday. Skipper Shubman Gill and opener Sai Sudharsan starred with the bat in a flawless run chase, as GT hunted down DC’s target of 200 with six balls to spare.Sudharsan blazed his way to a 61-ball unbeaten 108, while Gill remained unbeaten on a composed 93 off 53 deliveries. The two stitched together a record opening stand and ensured Gujarat’s place in the knockouts with two league matches still to play.“Feels great to get the Q (qualification), but still two important games left. Carrying momentum is important. I've talked about being a batter, think as one without worrying about captaincy,” said Gill at the post-match presentation.Reflecting on his captaincy journey, Gill admitted to early struggles in the role but said he has since learned how to handle the pressure.“Found it (captaincy) challenging last year, learnt how to manage it late in the season. Our fielding had been below par, we'd dropped a lot of catches, we reflected on that and worked on it during the break,” he said.Gill also credited his calm approach at the crease to a conscious decision to separate captaincy from batting responsibilities.“When you're in form, someone like Sai who's converting starts, you don't talk much. You just talk about what's required. When in flow, you just need to make sure you don't get carried away,” he explained.The enforced break due to military tensions between India and Pakistan, Gill said, gave him a chance to recover physically.“I'd gotten sick, the break helped me recover.”Assistant coach Parthiv Patel praised the openers’ approach and mutual understanding, which he believes have been crucial to GT’s success this season.“We've batted and played really well throughout, going into the playoffs is a reward for how well we've done. Openers play low-risk cricket, still they have the ability to hit down the ground and find boundaries.""The fours they hit during the game especially. They know their game, they put a lot of work in strengthening their basics which shows. They communicate well, last year they batted brilliantly.""Opening pair is about chemistry and knowing each other's games well which they do.""Parthiv also credited head coach Ashish Nehra ’s leadership for the team’s consistency and strong standing on the points table.“He's been fantastic and is the reason why we're right up there,” he said.Player of the match Sudharsan, now the leading run-scorer of the season alongside Gill (609 and 594 runs respectively), said staying mentally composed was key to chasing down a daunting total.“We took the game deep, were cool enough mentally and got 2-3 big overs after 12, which worked out. Had taken risks in earlier games which hadn't worked out. I've also started to believe myself more to take the game deeper, expand my game.""Not much has changed with my batting, but mentally I'm more free and expressive. Maybe I can get better at striking against spin and improving my batting after the 15th over.""On his partnership with Gill, Sudharsan highlighted the strong rapport they’ve built over time.“There's a lot of understanding. We complement each other especially when the other batter is doing well, running is a vital thing too,” he said.",Gujarat Titans qualify for IPL 2025 playoffs with 10-wicket victory over Delhi Capitals.

'Chances are still there': Abishek Porel believes in IPL 2025 playoff miracle

MUMBAI: When the Indian team is picked for the Bangladesh tour, which includes three ODIs and as many T20Is, in August, KL Rahul 's name is set to be considered for the T20Is as well. It has been almost two-and-a-half-years since Rahul played the last of his 72 T20Is for India.On November 10 in the semifinals of the T20 World Cup against England, Rahul, opening the innings with skipper Rohit Sharma, was dismissed by Chris Woakes for a five-ball five as India suffered a humiliating 10-wicket thrashing to exit the tournament.Having made just 128 runs in six matches at an average of 21.33 and strike rate of 120.75, Rahul had forced the selectors that India needed to look beyond him in the game's shortest format.However, in the last six months, Rahul has given every reason to convince the ""five wise men"" in Indian cricket that it's time to hand him a return ticket in T20Is.On Sunday night at the Arun Jaitley Stadium during a league match of IPL 2025, Rahul was at his majestic best, hitting one imperious shot after another, as he stroked a sublime unbeaten 112 off just 65 balls, which included 14 fours and four sixes, for the Delhi Capitals against Gujarat Titans.With Sai Sudharshan and Shubman Gill firing all guns against a mediocre DC bowling, Rahul's effort, which had helped DC get to 199 for three in 20 overs, got overshadowed.Yet, Rahul has been in sensational form in IPL 2025.During his blazing knock, Rahul became faster than greats like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma to score 8,000 runs in T20 cricket, achieving the feat in just 224 innings (237 matches).In 11 matches so far in IPL 2025, the 33-year-old 'keeper-batter has scored 493 runs off just 333 balls, with three fifties and a hundred, his strike rate being a healthy 148.04.More importantly, if he keeps batting like this, Rahul is definitely in the fray for a spot in the 2026 T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka in February-March next year.When the tournament began, Rahul batted at No. 4 in the team's interest, but moved to the opening slot when the IPL resumed for the franchise on Sunday, as Australian's Jake Fraser-McGurk didn't return for the rest of the tournament.He had entered the IPL after scoring 140 runs in 143 balls at an ""unreal"" average of 140 in five matches, with the team winning the 2025 Champions Trophy in UAE.","KL Rahul has scored 493 runs off just 333 balls, with three fifties and a hundred.

Greenstone Lobo predicts Virat Kohli & Rohit Sharma's ODI future

NEW DELHI: The IPL 2025 match between Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) witnessed a fiery moment as tempers flared between spinner Digvesh Rathi and SRH batter Abhishek Sharma in the 8th over of the innings.The dramatic incident occurred when Rathi dismissed a red-hot Abhishek Sharma for a blistering 59 off just 20 balls.Sharma, who had been toying with the bowlers, looked to launch a wide googly over the off-side but ended up slicing it to sweeper cover, where Shardul Thakur took a sharp running catch.What should’ve been a moment of celebration quickly turned tense.Rathi, known for his signature “book-sign” celebration, pulled it out once again after getting the breakthrough.But this time, it didn’t sit well with Sharma. The southpaw appeared visibly agitated and exchanged heated words with the bowler before umpires and teammates quickly stepped in to defuse the situation.Watch:At the time of Sharma's dismissal, SRH were cruising at 99 runs, looking set to chase down LSG’s challenging 205-run target. His aggressive knock, laced with four boundaries and six towering sixes, had given SRH a blazing start in reply to a solid LSG total.Earlier in the game, fifties from Mitchell Marsh (65) and Aiden Markram (61) powered LSG to a flying start. However, the middle overs dragged down their momentum, especially after the dismissal of skipper Rishabh Pant for just 7. Nicholas Pooran’s late blitz (45 off 26) pushed them past the 200-run mark.Despite the on-field tension, fans were buzzing over the Sharma-Rathi face-off, with clips of the altercation going viral online.

Phoenix Suns Allegations and Key Lawsuits

Explained: Phoenix Suns Lawsuit Involving Sophie Cunningham & Josh Bartelstein

A Pattern of Allegations

Phoenix Suns’ Response to recent Lawsuits and Allegations

Broader Context of the Lawsuit

The, once expected to turn a new page after the 2023 ownership change, are now embroiled in a series of high-profile lawsuits alleging workplace mismanagement, racial and gender discrimination, sexual harassment, and retaliation. Four separate lawsuits have been filed by current and former employees since November 2024, all in Arizona federal court and all under the leadership of new owner Mat Ishbia.The most recent lawsuit was filed by Gene Traylor, the Suns’ director of safety, security, and risk management. Traylor alleges that after he delivered a security assessment in 2023-outlining serious risks, including failed arena security tests where undercover police brought weapons inside-he was retaliated against and demoted.He claims the organization discouraged him from taking protected medical leave after a cancer diagnosis and ignored urgent safety concerns, some of which involved high-profile incidents like the harassment of former Mercury player Brittney Griner at an airport.Another notable lawsuit comes from Andrea Trischan, the team’s former manager of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Trischan, who joined the Suns after the NBA sanctioned former owner Robert Sarver for racist and sexist workplace behavior, alleges she was subjected to racial discrimination, sexual harassment, and retaliation, ultimately leading to her wrongful termination. Her lawsuit also claims financial and sexual misconduct by current and former executives, and she is seeking $60 million in damages.All four lawsuits are represented by attorney Sheree D. Wright, who asserts that the cases reveal a “credible, detailed, and independently corroborated testimony of multiple current and former Suns employees-across departments, races, and roles-who allege a culture of racial discrimination, retaliation, hostile work environments, and systemic failures in accountability”.The Phoenix Suns’ leadership has categorically denied all allegations, labeling the lawsuits as “delusional and categorically false.” Team spokesperson Stacey Mitch has accused Wright of attempting to extort the organization, while also acknowledging that the franchise faced “significant challenges with the culture under the previous ownership” but claims substantial improvements have been made since Ishbia took over.These lawsuits come in the wake of the NBA’s 2022 investigation into former owner Robert Sarver, who was suspended and fined for fostering a toxic workplace. Despite new ownership, the Suns continue to face scrutiny, with more employees reportedly preparing to come forward as additional lawsuits are anticipated.Also read: Caitlin Clark and Tyrese Haliburton’s Sideline Spark: Inside Indianapolis’ Hottest Basketball Bromance The ongoing legal battles highlight persistent issues within the Suns organization, raising questions about the effectiveness of recent reforms and the broader culture in professional sports workplaces.","The Phoenix Suns are embroiled in a series of high-profile lawsuits alleging workplace mismanagement, racial and gender discrimination, sexual harassment, and retaliation.

Stanley Cup Playoffs 2025: Florida Panthers and Dallas Stars lead the confident charge in conference finals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/stanley-cup-playoffs-2025-florida-panthers-and-dallas-stars-lead-the-confident-charge-in-conference-finals/articleshow/121276587.cms,"Image Via Getty ( Florida Panthers and Dallas Stars lead the confident charge in conference finals)

Sergei Bobrovsky and Brad Marchand keep the Florida Panthers ahead of the Carolina Hurricanes

Jake Oettinger and Mikko Rantanen catapult Dallas Stars ahead of Edmonton Oilers





Down to the last four teams in the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Conference Finals are set for some gripping matchups. Florida must reach the Stanley Cup Final for the third straight year. Dallas, on the other hand, is trying to prove it is still No. 1 in the West. Both teams, in varying degrees, are fairly experienced with their recent runs, offensive depth, and landmark performances that can tilt the series in their favor against big challenges like the Carolina Hurricanes and Edmonton Oilers.For whatever reason, the Florida Panthers had some rocky moments in that second round, but they came back from 2-0-there lies proof of why they are always considered a postseason powerhouse. After going behind 2-0 in the series, the Panthers fully utilized all their balanced offensive talents alongside some October heroics from goalie Sergei Bobrovsky to finish off the series. Bobrovsky did so with brilliant saves, posting an unprecedented save percentage on unblocked shots, validating his stature as a playoff game-changer.Adding veteran forward Brad Marchand, who joined the outfit midseason, injected yet more fireworks into the already potent offense. With 12 points already in this postseason and timely overtime goals pushing the momentum shift in the previous series, Marchand is good at both rousting an offense and modeling leadership for his teammates. With Tkachuk and Barkov, the lines of the Panthers' forwards are actual matches for any opposition.While Carolina might prevail in terms of five-on-five control, with strong performers such as Sebastian Aho and Andrei Svechnikov, the Florida core is a complete team equipped with playoff experience, top goaltending, and physical depth across all of its lines. Much as the Hurricanes may stretch Florida more than in the 2023 sweep, the latter looks set to vibe past them once more.The Western Conference is quite interesting as the Dallas Stars are back at their familiar place, marking their third consecutive trip to the Conference Finals. This consistency stems from the forwards in the high end and the defensive play that is led by Miro Heiskanen. The offensive charge is headed by Mikko Rantanen, the first in goals and points in the postseason.Rounding off the advantage for the Stars over Stuart Skinner of Edmonton or Calvin Pickard, whose faltering performances could either make or break the Oilers in a tight series, has been Oettinger's impregnable conditioning in goal, especially against the heavily favored Winnipeg Jets. And yet, a stagnant offense that ranks on the higher side but is led by Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, combined with poor depth and an unsteady defense, could be clogging their way. Dallas has more depth and better goaltending to let them hustle through an Oiler storm in a hard-fought series that goes all the way.Also Read: Evan Rodrigues ruled out as Jesper Boqvist joins Panthers top line Going into the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs, it seemed the two teams, the Florida Panthers and Dallas Stars, would be the saying for the Final.

'Chances are still there': Abishek Porel believes in IPL 2025 playoff miracle

A rare moment of frustration was on full display as Lucknow Super Giants ’ vice-captain Nicholas Pooran lost his cool during the IPL 2025 clash against Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Ekana Stadium on Monday.The incident occurred in the final over of LSG’s innings. Pooran, who had played a gritty knock of 45 off 26 balls, was run out in dramatic fashion on the third ball of the 20th over (19.3) while trying to retain strike. In an apparent attempt to maximise the final three deliveries, Pooran went for a risky second run, only to fall short.Visibly frustrated after the dismissal, Pooran stormed back to the dugout and was caught on camera angrily throwing gloves inside the dressing room area. The visuals quickly went viral, with the southpaw's body language clearly reflecting his disappointment, both at the dismissal and the missed opportunity to finish strong.Earlier in the innings, LSG had gotten off to a flying start, thanks to half-centuries from Mitchell Marsh (65 off 39) and Aiden Markram (61 off 38). The pair added 69 runs in the Powerplay, targeting debutant Harsh Dubey and veteran Pat Cummins alike. However, the middle overs saw SRH claw their way back with wickets and tight lines.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Captain Rishabh Pant , who surprisingly came in at No. 3 ahead of Pooran, failed once again with the bat, managing just 7 off 6 balls. Pooran eventually walked in and tried to regain control, though the big hits didn’t come as easily as usual. Still, his quickfire contribution took LSG past 200, with help from a 20-run final over bowled by Nitish Reddy.Pooran’s emotional reaction post-dismissal highlights the pressure LSG are under as they fight to keep their playoff hopes alive. With their qualification scenario hanging by a thread, every run — and every moment — counts.As for SRH, who are already out of playoff contention, they will take heart from their bowlers’ strong comeback after the powerplay blitz. But all eyes were on Pooran’s post-wicket reaction, sparking plenty of chatter about the intensity and emotions at play during high-stakes IPL clashes.","Lucknow Super Giants vice-captain Nicholas Pooran lost his cool during the IPL 2025 clash against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Monday.

Which NXT superstar has now officially become a part of Monday Night RAW?

A top champion from NXT has officially become a part of the RAW roster and secured a big win on her first night.WWE RAW and SmackDown are making waves by bringing in new superstars from the developmental territory of NXT to their rosters. Last week on SmackDown, GM Nick Aldis revealed that the Beautiful Madness, Giulia, had officially signed with the blue brand. RAW GM Adam Pearce had a perfect counter move by bringing a former two-time NXT champion to his roster.Before the May 19th, 2025 edition of WWE RAW, Adam Pearce was seen in a backstage segment with NXT star, Roxanne Perez . Pearce presented her with an official superstar contract and revealed her as the newest superstar of the red brand as she signed on the dotted line, confirming her main roster call-up.On her first night as a Monday Night RAW superstar, Roxanne Perez was scheduled to compete in the first Money in the Bank triple threat qualifying match against Becky Lynch and Natalya. She displayed an excellent showing and impressed the audience. Towards the final moments of the bout, Lyra Vallkyria came down and engaged in a brawl with her rival, Becky Lynch.That led to Natalya taking her eye off the ball and Perez finding the opportunity to hit the Pop Rox on the veteran to secure the pinfall. With her win, The Prodigy became the second woman to qualify for the Women's Money in the Bank ladder match, after Alexa Bliss, who qualified last week on SmackDown.Later that night, Finn Balor introduced Roxanne Perez to the Judgment Day faction in a backstage segment. While Balor mentioned that she was not an official part of the group, they could use some extra numbers. Carlito and JD McDonagh were thrilled, but Dominik Mysterio and Raquel Rodriguez were not and told Balor that Liv Morgan should hear about it.However, Dirty Dom also came along after Perez gave him his beloved chicken tenders as a gift. With the former two-time NXT Women's Champion having a great start on RAW, it will be interesting to see her journey in the big leagues.Also read: Why are the makers of Queen of the Ring accusing WWE of sabotaging promotional events?","A top champion from NXT has officially become a part of the RAW roster.

After retiring from football, he took an unexpected path filmmaking . It was a bold move for someone who had spent most of his life defined by physical dominance.Yet, Rice embraced the challenge, attending film school and later writing and directing his own projects. The leap from the field to the director’s chair was far from easy, and Rice himself acknowledges that.“In football, what you see is what you get. It’s a dog-eat-dog business, but the best will survive,” Rice said. “You can’t prepare for something like making a film. You can make the best film in the world, but that doesn’t mean people are going to see it.”These words reflect the humility and realism Rice brings to his second career. While he once measured success in tackles and championships, he now views it through the lens of storytelling, creativity, and persistence.His induction into the Ring of Honor is a celebration not only of his football achievements but also of his remarkable journey of reinvention.

'Chances are still there': Abishek Porel believes in IPL 2025 playoff miracle

NEW DELHI: After a season that has left Chennai Super Kings ’ loyal fanbase stunned, head coach Stephen Fleming stands at a crossroads, needing to make important choices for the future of the franchise.The IPL-2025 campaign has been, by CSK ’s own lofty standards, a disaster: just three wins in 12 games, a bottom-of-the-table finish looming and the ‘Dad’s Army’ philosophy — so often their secret weapon — suddenly under siege.Yet, as Fleming surveys the wreckage, his vision for the franchise’s future remains as nuanced and steadfast as ever, rooted in a belief in experience, but now increasingly open to the promise of youth. Fleming’s coaching style has been defined by calm, clarity and continuity.The former New Zealand captain is not one for knee-jerk reactions or sweeping changes, even in the face of adversity. This philosophy of trusting seasoned campaigners to deliver under pressure has been the backbone of CSK’s five IPL titles and 12 playoff appearances.However, the 2025 season has forced Fleming and CSK’s management to confront uncomfortable truths. The collective failure of senior players — Devon Conway, Vijay Shankar, Rahul Tripathi, R Ashwin, Deepak Hooda and the talismanic MS Dhoni among them — left the team off the pace early in the season.Injuries and loss of form exposed the limitations of relying solely on the old guard. Fleming, ever pragmatic, acknowledged the need for introspection. “The challenge for us now is to make sure out of this that we do go over everything that we are doing now and have done in the past, to make sure we are keeping up with the philosophies (of the team), but also identify talent for the future,” the New Zealander said.This season, perhaps more than any other, has compelled Fleming to accelerate CSK’s gradual transition. The introduction of young, swashbuckling batters like Ayush Mhatre and Dewald Brevis, as well as Afghan leggie Noor Ahmad, has not just been a necessity but a glimpse into the franchise’s future.Fleming’s assessment of the impact the youngsters have had was unequivocal. “They have certainly had an impact, which is positive from a season that has been a challenge. But, we realised early on that we were off pace. So, to be able to introduce these players…. they are definitely in line for the future as we regenerate the team and redevelop or reconfirm our philosophy of how we want to play,” Fleming said, signaling a willingness to evolve without abandoning the core principles.“It’s one thing to say we want a team full of young players, but you’ve got to find them. So, it’s identifying talent and making sure they fit in. My point has always been a mixture of youth and experience.”","Chennai Super Kings have won just three games in the IPL-2025. Head coach Stephen Fleming is at a crossroads over the future of the franchise. Fleming is increasingly open to the promise of youth. The introduction of young, swashbuckling batters like Ayush Mhatre and Dewald Brevis has not just been a necessity but a glimpse into the franchise’s future.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121281776,imgsize-42094,width-400,resizemode-4/Fleming-2005-CSK.jpg"

Gunther came out to inform him that if he did get past Uso, he would be waiting for him on the other side on the June 9th episode of RAW. The segment came to an end when Jey Uso arrived and took Paul down with a superkick.This was a tag team match. It was one of the most captivating matches between the two sides. Things looked to be moving in Penta and AJ Styles' favor until El Grande Americano appeared in the crowd and took down Penta with a headshot, having something in his mask. This led to Balaor delivering the Coupe De Grace on him to pick up the win for his team.This was a triple-threat Money in the Bank qualifying match. The match was a spectacular sight and was also Roxanne Perez's first match as an official RAW superstar. The bout ended when Lyra Valkyria interfered to attack Becky Lynch, which distracted Natalya, who ate a Pop Rox from Perez. The Prodigy pinned her to qualify for the ladder match.This was a singles match that was made official last week. It looked very one-sided as Sheamus established his dominance over Grayson Waller.

That led to Sheamus delivering the Ten Beats of Bodhran, followed by a Brogue Kick to secure the win.This was the second triple-threat Money in the Bank qualifying match.

They continued the attack until CM Punk and Sami Zayn arrived to brawl with them. The four men exited the ringside area, trading punches. As Jey Uso got up on his feet, Logan Paul appeared out of nowhere to knock him down with a punch.Also read: WWE megastars John Cena and Hulk Hogan’s less than known connection explored","The May 19th edition of Monday Night RAW took place at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, South Carolina.

'Chances are still there': Abishek Porel believes in IPL 2025 playoff miracle

NEW DELHI: As the IPL’s long summer winds towards its conclusion, the Arun Jaitley Stadium is set to host a faceoff between two storied but struggling franchises, Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals The match on Tuesday evening may lack playoff implications, with both teams languishing at the foot of the table, but pride, future prospects, and the desire to end on a high note remain potent motivators for both sides. Chennai Super Kings, five-time champions and perennial heavyweights, have endured a rare bad season.With only three wins from 12 matches, their campaign has been defined by a revolving door of personnel and the absence of performance from their overseas stars. The team’s traditional reliance on experienced players, often dubbed the ‘dad’s army’, has come under scrutiny this season.Despite the team’s struggles, head coach Stephen Fleming has reiterated his commitment to this philosophy, emphasizing the value of experience over age.“I don’t care how old the players are. The experience has served us really well over the grand years that we have had. It hasn’t worked out quite well for us this year. The fact that we have been so consistent over a number of years to have a poor year has shaken everybody. It is understandable given the excellence in which the franchises are operating,” Fleming said.“I am a fan of experience, experience wins tournaments. But the youth and talent in this country is something you can’t ignore,” he added.Despite Fleming’s words, it’s a group of youngsters who have shone for CSK this season.Ayush Mhatre and Dewald Brevis have displayed potential and hold the promise for delivering for the franchise in coming seasons. In the bowling front, the emergence of Noor Ahmad has been a silver lining. The young Afghan spinner has impressed with his wicket-taking abilities and economy rate. Alongside him, Matheesha Pathirana has shown promise. Overall, though, CSK’s bowling unit has lacked consistency.For Rajasthan Royals, this fixture marks the end of a disappointing campaign. Injuries, inconsistency, and the absence of key overseas stars have left them ninth on the points table, with just three wins, a record matched only by their opponents.CSK are 10th by virtue of a lower net run-rate. The Royals’ most recent heartbreak came in a narrow 10-run loss to Punjab Kings, a result emblematic of their season — flashes of brilliance undermined by lapses under pressure.Yashasvi Jaiswal and Vaibhav Sooryavanshi have been the bright spots, with their 166-run stand against Gujarat Titans earlier this season highlighting their potential.Jaiswal has been a consistent force, blending aggression with composure. Sooryavanshi, the teen wonder, has shown flashes of brilliance, and the match against CSK offers him another chance to cement his reputation on the big stage.","Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals face off in the final IPL match of the season. Both teams are struggling at the bottom of the table, with only three wins from 12 matches. Head coach Stephen Fleming has stressed the importance of experience over age.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121281699,imgsize-39846,width-400,resizemode-4/Dhoni-2005-IPL.jpg"

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.
