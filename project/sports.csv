NBA world reacts to Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton’s heartbreaking injury



It was the worst of times for the Indiana Pacers. Tyrese Haliburton has sustained a devastating leg injury during the NBA Finals Game 7 decider. After his injury, several NBA stars and legends reacted to the heartbreaking blow the Indiana Pacers had to face. While it was inevitable, as he has been battling the leg injury since Game 5, Haliburton wanted to give a fast fight for the championship, but his injury left the team in a crushing position, giving the OKC Thunder the edge to a stunning lead in the fourth quarter. Sadly, the Pacers lost Haliburton just before the halftime lead, and the momentum of the game changed afterwards.Game 7 of the NBA Finals between the Indiana Pacers and the Oklahoma City Thunder took a devastating turn early, shaking the very core of Indiana’s title hopes. Just under five minutes into the first quarter, Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton went down with a right lower leg injury and was helped off the court in visible pain.

Cowboys star Micah Parsons nearing massive $200M deal as his brother fuels off-field firestorm



As the Dallas Cowboys gear up for training camp next month, all eyes are on Micah Parsons. The franchise’s defensive cornerstone has already committed to attending, but what’s unclear is how involved he’ll actually be. With his contract situation looming large, the team faces a potentially season-defining decision. And the stakes? They’re historic.Parsons, arguably the most explosive edge rusher in the NFL today, is staring down a deal that could make him the highest-paid non-quarterback in league history. Cowboys insider Mike Fisher didn’t mince words, stating, “It’s inevitable and it’s almost inarguable. Micah is going to sign the richest-ever non-QB contract in NFL history.” According to Fisher, the expected figure exceeds $200 million over five years — a contract that would place Parsons in a financial tier of his own.But every day Dallas delays, the price tag ticks upward. The original $40 million annual projection is now old news. With players like Myles Garrett and Maxx Crosby already setting new baselines and T.J. Watt’s potential extension on the horizon, the market is shifting rapidly.Industry whispers already place Parsons’ ask between $45–50 million per year — a figure that could balloon further if Dallas doesn't act swiftly.Despite skipping OTAs, Parsons returned for mandatory minicamp. Yet he was quick to remind the Cowboys front office that stalling could cost them. And his brother, Terrence Parsons Jr., added fuel to the fire with a subtle yet stinging retweet. It read: “The craziest thing about the cowboys building a CHAMPIONSHIP roster… they really will be like 2-3 pieces away and be like nah we cool … let’s wait til next year and see what we can find 😭. ” Terrence’s one-word response? “This.”That frustration isn’t unique. It echoes across Cowboys Nation, a fanbase tired of waiting for a front office to take the leap. Dallas, after all, hasn’t won a Super Bowl since 1995 — when Friends was the hottest show on TV and Tupac was still alive. The ghosts of Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, and Michael Irvin haunt every roster move today. Even Aikman recently admitted, “They’re going to contend and be stronger than they’ve probably gotten credit for up to this point. ”Still, the roster feels frozen in a state of “almost.” Despite Dak Prescott closing in on franchise passing records and Parsons posting an eye-popping 52.5 sacks in just 63 games, the team keeps falling short — like a perfectly built Madden squad stuck in eternal conference championship limbo.Now, the Cowboys find themselves in familiar territory. The franchise has been here before — drawing out high-stakes negotiations with Dak, with CeeDee Lamb — waiting, betting on leverage, and ultimately paying more after tensions rise. The whispers suggest Jerry Jones could be holding off not because of indecision, but to reap roughly $332,000 a month in interest by stalling the payout. But while the numbers may impress on a spreadsheet, they’re alienating a generational talent.Parsons, on a $24 million fifth-year option, could opt for a “hold-in” — showing up to camp but not participating fully. It would be a strategic move, a signal that the clock has run out on patience.Terrence’s tweet isn’t just brotherly support. It captures the spirit of every fan who’s had enough of “next year.” When you’ve got a player like Parsons — a transcendent force capable of transforming the defense and elevating the entire franchise — hesitation becomes a liability.The question isn’t whether the Cowboys can pay him. It’s whether they’re ready to finally act like a team chasing a championship — not just their past glory. The clock is ticking, and Oxnard awaits.Also Read: ""Still got cheated on by his wife"": Shirtless at 47, Tom Brady flexes shredded physique and fans bring Gisele Bundchen reference","Micah Parsons could be the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history.

Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill is once again making headlines — not for a game-winning touchdown, but for a fiery and expletive-laced tirade targeting Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills. Known for his speed and bold personality, Hill didn’t hold back during his appearance at Fanatics Fest 2025, calling out Buffalo’s defense and reigniting one of the NFL’s oldest rivalries.Tyreek Hill, nicknamed “The Cheetah” for his elite speed, didn’t mince words when describing how Buffalo plays defense against him. “Whenever we play the Bills, those guys typically play Cover Four because they're a bunch of b*tches,” Hill declared in front of a live crowd.The timing of Hill’s rant is notable. Though the Dolphins have only beaten the Bills once since he joined the team, Hill made it clear that stats don’t soften his stance. His frustration appears deeply personal, shaped not just by recent losses but by years of competition dating back to his time with the Kansas City Chiefs.The Dolphins-Bills rivalry dates back to 1966, and Buffalo has largely had the upper hand in recent years — especially with Josh Allen at quarterback.Since Allen entered the league in 2018, the Bills have dominated the Dolphins, winning 12 of their last 14 meetings.Still, Hill’s personal grudge runs deeper than team records. He reminisced about his days with the Chiefs, saying, “When I used to play in Kansas City, it was always 'fck the Bills' every time we played against them. And we fcked them up every single time.”If anyone thought his Fanatics Fest rant was a one-time explosion, Hill quickly proved otherwise. Just days earlier, he made similar comments in another interview, showing that his disdain for the Bills isn’t just emotional — it’s habitual.""It's the same thing too, though — just like ten times harder.

LeBron James shared a one-word NSFW reaction to Tyrese Haliburton’s injury as Pacers battle in Game 7 thriller



With everything on the line in a win-or-go-home Game 7 of the 2025 NBA Finals, the Indiana Pacers were dealt a crushing blow. Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton went down early in the first quarter with a lower right leg injury, shaking the momentum of a tense, back-and-forth battle against the Oklahoma City Thunder. While several NBA stars and legends are reacting to the devastating blow, LeBron James dropped one one-word NSFW reaction. Haliburton, already playing through a strained right calf from Game 5, left the court unable to put weight on his leg and did not return. His injury left fans and teammates in shock as the Pacers tried to keep their championship hopes alive.Sunday night’s Game 7 at Oklahoma City’s Paycom Center had all the ingredients of a classic NBA Finals finish until a heart-wrenching moment shifted the tone. With 4:55 remaining in the first quarter, Tyrese Haliburton attempted a drive when he collapsed to the floor in pain. The injury was non-contact, and the reaction was immediate. Haliburton began punching the court in visible frustration, signaling the seriousness of the moment.Los Angeles Lakers legend LeBron James took to X to share one-word reaction as he was in awe. “F*CK!!!!!!!! 🤦🏾‍♂️🙏🏾” he wrote on X.Haliburton had already scored nine points, all from beyond the arc, and was helping the Pacers hang tight in a tight contest.But after the fall, he was unable to walk and had to be assisted to the locker room by medical staff, his face wrapped in towels to hide his emotions. ESPN’s Lisa Salters later reported that Haliburton’s father, John Haliburton, confirmed the injury was to his Achilles, though the team has not yet made an official diagnosis.John Haliburton added that his son was ""in good spirits"" and watching the game from the locker room, urging his teammates on. The injury sent shockwaves through the Pacers' bench. Virtually the entire Indiana squad, including players, coaches, and trainers, gathered around him on the court.The loss of their floor general mid-game added a layer of emotional intensity to the Pacers’ already uphill battle. “It’s a heartbreak, man,” Pacers center Myles Turner told Salters during an in-game interview. “It’s unfortunate... but we’ve got his back.”Also Read: James Harden stuns fans by dressing as WWE legend Hulk Hogan at Fanatics Fest showdown Despite the earlier calf strain that had been bothering him since Game 5, Haliburton had made it clear he wasn’t going to miss Game 7. “If I can walk, I want to play,” he said—an attitude that now defines both his season and his heart. However, he had to exit Game 7 as he pushed himself to the edge for the Championship.","LeBron James shared a one-word NSFW reaction to Tyrese Haliburton’s injury as Pacers battle in Game 7 thriller against Oklahoma City Thunder.

Poll Do you think flamboyant celebrations like Pant's should be encouraged in cricket? Yes, they bring excitement. No, they distract from the game.

Yashasvi Jaiswal credits Shubman Gill after maiden Test ton in England: 'I love it'

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant has never been one to stick to the script, and he proved that once again at Headingley with a celebration as electrifying as his innings.After notching up his seventh Test century in classic Pant style, charging down the track and launching Shoaib Bashir over deep midwicket for a towering six, the India vice-captain stunned fans and teammates alike with a surprise somersault celebration.The move, equal parts flamboyant and athletic, quickly set social media ablaze and became the highlight of Day 2 of the first Test between India and England.While Pant’s acrobatics wowed viewers, they also drew amused and admiring reactions from former cricketers and teammates.In a video shared by BCCI, Dinesh Karthik quipped, ""Neither could I do the somersault like him, nor can I bat like him. When I was very young, my parents made me try gymnastics, and I was an utter failure. So let's just leave it there because he's doing it so much nicer when he celebrates it.""Former head coach Ravi Shastri also praised Pant's unexpected flair: “At a very young age, he did a lot of gymnastics. He does it really well. I think it was unique. No one expected him to do that. Nothing wrong with it — though if I tried it, I’d probably end up in a swimming pool!” Cheteshwar Pujara , typically reserved, summed it up simply: “Rishabh being Rishabh.He does something unique.”Pant’s celebration mirrored one he had pulled off during the IPL earlier this year, but seeing it on the Test stage added a new level of surprise. His innings — a blistering 134 off 178 balls with 12 fours and six sixes — came at a crucial time, forging a vital partnership with Shubman Gill (147) to push India beyond the 400-run mark.As fans marvelled at the shot-making, it was the flip that stole the spotlight — a moment that perfectly encapsulated Pant’s spirit: fearless, fun, and fiercely unforgettable.","India's Rishabh Pant stunned fans and teammates with a surprise somersault celebration.

India lose momentum on Day 2 | England Fight Back at Headingley

NEW DELHI: Shubman Gill burst into an animated celebration after Mohammed Siraj dismissed Joe Root during a crucial phase of the match. The Indian Test captain charged toward Siraj, pointing at him in a way that clearly signaled their well-executed plan had worked perfectly. But the joy was short-lived. Root immediately reviewed the decision, and the DRS showed a faint edge was missing — the on-field call was overturned, and the former England skipper survived.Watching Gill’s exuberance, former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar couldn’t help but draw comparisons. He said Gill’s reaction reminded him of someone familiar — someone who used to bat at No. 4. Without naming him, the hint was obvious: Virat Kohli “Who is this — Shubman Gill or someone else?” Manjrekar said on air.“When he bats, he seems so calm, composed — a completely different personality. Captain Gill, we are seeing this version for the first time. His celebration… it reminded me of someone, but I’m struggling to place it. MS Dhoni never celebrated like that from mid-on, and it’s definitely not Rohit Sharma ’s style. Could be a No. 4 batter... My third guess would be Ajit Wadekar,” he added, sparking laughter in the commentary box, with Varun Aaron and Navjot Singh Sidhu joining in.Gill’s day wasn’t just about fiery reactions. It was also a record-setting one.The 24-year-old became only the fifth Indian to score a century on Test captaincy debut, joining the elite company of Sunil Gavaskar, Virat Kohli, Vijay Hazare, and Dilip Vengsarkar. His composed 100 came off 140 balls, laced with 14 boundaries, anchoring India to a strong position.This match also marked the start of the 2025–27 World Test Championship cycle for both teams, and Gill made the occasion count. He also crossed the 2,000-run milestone in Test cricket, achieving the landmark in his 60th innings — the same match in which Virat Kohli also reached 2,000 runs during his captaincy debut.Gill now becomes the 23rd player to score a hundred in his first Test as captain, and the fourth youngest to do so, behind Herbie Taylor, Alastair Cook, and Steve Smith.His act in the commentary box led to big laughter among other commentators, including Varun Aaron and Navjot Singh Sidhu.Gill joins the elite list of Indians, which includes Sunil Gavaskar, Virat Kohli, Vijay Hazare and Dilip Vengsarkar to score 100 on Test captaincy debut.

India lose momentum on Day 2 | England Fight Back at Headingley

India's ODI captain Rohit Sharma recently shared the story of his romantic proposal to wife Ritika Sajdeh during a conversation with former cricketer Harbhajan Singh and his wife Geeta Basra Singh on the YouTube channel ""Who's The Boss?"" The cricketer revealed how he orchestrated a surprise proposal by taking Ritika to his childhood cricket ground under the pretense of getting ice cream, where he went down on one knee in the middle of the pitch while his friend captured the moment.The cricket star recounted the details of the memorable evening, explaining how the proposal unfolded along Mumbai's familiar landmarks.""My proposal was quite romantic. I took her to the place where I started playing cricket. We were here only (somewhere along Marine Drive apparently). She had brought food from home. We ate it. So, I was just sitting. Then I told her let's go out to eat ice cream, I'm bored. Then we took the car out, we left. We left from Marine Drive, crossed Haji Ali, Worli. So, she asked where is the ice cream shop? She does not know anything after Bandra. I told her there's a good one in Borivali, where I live. You've never come, so let me show you,"" Rohit shared during the conversation.The cricket captain continued describing the actual proposal moment at the ground.""It was a ground and it was pitch dark and she didn't realise it was a ground.Then I had already told my friend to set up something there at the ground and just be there to capture the moment. We parked the car. Then I went on my knees, in the middle of the pitch. Then, I proposed to her,"" Rohit revealed.The revelation comes amid significant changes in Rohit's cricket career, as he recently announced his retirement from T20 internationals following India's victory in the 2024 T20 World Cup held in the West Indies and the USA.In May 2025, Rohit also stepped away from red-ball cricket, making the announcement just before the squad selection for the England Test series.Quiz: Who's that IPL player?

India’s Day 3 Test Review: Cloudy skies ahead | Weather twist at Headingley

Indian fast bowler Prasidh Krishna faced a challenging outing in the first Test against England at Leeds, registering the most expensive economy rate for an Indian bowler who has bowled at least 20 overs in a single spell.Prasidh took three important wickets, removing Ollie Pope Harry Brook , and Jamie Smith, but leaked runs heavily throughout his spell. His figures of 3 for 128 came at an economy rate of 6.40 runs per over, surpassing the previous record held by Varun Aaron, who went for 5.91 per over in Adelaide in 2014.England’s batters attacked Prasidh relentlessly, forcing him to struggle with his lengths and consistency, although his breakthroughs did help India stay in the contest. This performance is likely to spark conversations about India’s pace bowling options and their bench strength in testing overseas conditions.Despite Prasidh’s expensive spell, India stayed competitive thanks largely to Jasprit Bumrah ’s outstanding five-wicket haul that kept the hosts from taking a big first innings lead. England posted 465 in reply to India’s total of 471.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? At the end of a rain-affected Day 3, India held a slender advantage with a lead of 96 runs. The visitors finished at 90 for 2 with KL Rahul unbeaten on 47 and captain Shubman Gill at the crease on six.

Chemotherapy begins as family clings to hope

The Mahomes family is facing an unexpected health crisis that’s shaken their inner circle and captured fans’ hearts. Randi Mahomes, mother of NFL icon Patrick Mahomes, has revealed that a young family member is battling a rare pediatric cancer. What started as a minor health scare quickly turned into a fight for survival. Now, the family is reaching out for strength, prayers, and support.On Sunday, Randi posted an emotional update on Instagram that caught many by surprise. “Asking for prayers for my cousin’s grandson, Luka,” she wrote, alongside a photo of the infant smiling from a hospital crib. The next image was heartbreaking—Luka, asleep, hooked to tubes and oxygen lines. “Sweet Luka is in the hospital fighting stage L2 intermediate neuroblastoma.”The diagnosis hit without warning. Luka had appeared perfectly healthy until he turned eight months old. During a family vacation, he accidentally aspirated a bit of pool water. His mother Cassie, an ICU nurse, initially suspected pneumonia. But when his condition worsened, instincts told her it was far more serious.On June 3, Luka was airlifted to Dallas Children’s Hospital for emergency evaluation.Scans showed a large tumor pressing against his left lung. Randi later shared, “Luka was a perfectly healthy baby boy up until the day he turned 8 months old and was life-flighted… A large tumor was found on his lung.” Doctors acted fast to insert a chest tube and begin treatment.Luka’s cancer hasn’t spread to other organs, but it already caused one lung to collapse. After five days in the ICU, he began chemotherapy and remains in the oncology unit. A second chemo round is set for June 25. Doctors are closely monitoring the fluid around his lungs and hoping for stable breathing.Cassie and her husband Carlos have been by Luka’s side every day. Because of her son’s vulnerable immune system, Cassie can’t return to work, amplifying the emotional and financial strain. Yet despite the hardship, the family continues to fight with courage and determination.Along with prayer requests, Randi also pointed followers to a GoFundMe titled “HELP LUKA FIGHT STAGE L2 INTERMEDIATE NEUROBLASTOMA.” The fundraiser supports mounting medical bills and day-to-day needs.

Poll Was Rishabh Pant's dismissal a turning point in the match? Yes, definitely Possibly Not really No, it didn't matter

Yashasvi Jaiswal credits Shubman Gill after maiden Test ton in England: 'I love it'

NEW DELHI: Team India's vice-captain Rishabh Pant lit up Day 2 of the Headingley Test not just with his bat, but also with his words.In a now-viral video, Pant was caught on the stump mic saying, “Suja diya yaar maar maar ke, ek hi jagah maare ja raha hai” — roughly translating to, “He’s made me swollen, man, just by hitting the same spot again and again!”The comment, directed at partner Ravindra Jadeja , came right after an aggressive phase of his innings.Watch:Ironically, Pant was dismissed on the very next ball, pinned lbw by Josh Tongue after shouldering arms to a delivery that nipped back sharply.Despite the dismissal, Pant’s 134 (off 178 balls) was a masterclass in controlled aggression, featuring fearless strokeplay and tactical brilliance.Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar later praised Pant’s unusual “falling paddle sweep”, calling it “intentional and extremely clever”.According to the legendary batter, the shot allowed Pant to scoop the ball with precision over leg slip, especially effective against Bashir.Tendulkar also pointed out the strategic mid-over conversations in Hindi between Shubman Gill and Pant, suggesting they were designed to disrupt the young spinner’s rhythm.Gill and Pant’s 209-run stand was the cornerstone of India’s imposing 471-run total, following Yashasvi Jaiswal’s fluent 101. Gill’s composed 147 and Pant’s flamboyant ton put England’s attack under severe pressure -- until both fell within quick succession, triggering a collapse.While India lost their last seven wickets for just 41 runs, Jasprit Bumrah ensured they stayed in command with a three-wicket burst, including the vital scalp of Joe Root. But Ollie Pope ’s gritty unbeaten 100 kept England in the game at 209/3.","India's vice-captain Rishabh Pant lit up Day 2 of the Headingley Test.

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Debuts Gold Converse SHAI 001s After NBA Finals Win and MVP Sweep,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/shai-gilgeous-alexander-stuns-with-gold-converse-shai-001s-moments-after-leading-oklahoma-city-thunder-to-nba-title/articleshow/122015500.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander completes a rare MVP sweep that hasn’t been seen in over two decades

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander turned each playoff game into a unique sneaker launch, and the gold SHAI 001 was his most understated yet bold move. It didn’t make an appearance in the pregame. It didn’t need a dramatic entrance. It only showed up once the game was over. That kind of timing isn’t coincidental—it’s the outcome of a vision that’s been set from day one.In the Oklahoma City Thunder's 103-91 Game 7 win over the Indiana Pacers on June 22, Shai was nothing less than phenomenal, racking up 29 points and 12 assists, which clinched him the Finals MVP award. He achieved the impressive feat of winning the scoring title, regular-season MVP, and Finals MVP all in one season—something that hasn't been accomplished since Shaquille O'Neal in 2002. This game also brought the franchise its first title since moving from Seattle in 2008.When Shai returned to the court, his gold SHAI 001s glimmered like the Larry O’Brien Trophy and the Finals MVP award he was carrying. It was a visual shout-out — his way of indicating that this win was as much about individual style as it was about the team's victory.The gold colorway contributes to the ever-growing lineup of SHAI 001 releases: the ""Butter"" model is expected to be released this Fall for $130, while other styles such as ""Masi Blue,"" ""Charm Black,"" and ""Hail Clay"" have been showcased during playoffs and Finals, each paying tribute to his loved ones.In April 2024, Shai became Converse Basketball’s creative director, which gave him a direct hand in designing the SHAI 001—from the unibody molded upper and zip-shroud to the Nike Zoom Air cushioning and radial traction. The gold edition isn’t just a showy extra — it captures the performance DNA and personal journey he’s woven into the silhouette.The reveal of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's gold SHAI 001 after the Thunder's championship goes beyond just fashion—it's the ultimate highlight of a season marked by excellence, creativity, and designs inspired by athletes.Also Read: LeBron James hints at possible NBA retirement while joking with Tom Brady and Victor Wembanyama Those sparkling kicks capture his story perfectly — MVP success, creative freedom, and a legacy established not just through banners, but through style.

Poll Was Rishabh Pant's reaction justified given the match situation? Yes, he was frustrated No, he overreacted

During a tense moment in England's innings at Headingley, India's vice-captain Rishabh Pant faces potential ICC sanctions after displaying frustration over an umpire's decision regarding a ball change request. The incident unfolded after the penultimate delivery of the 61st over when Mohammed Siraj was hit for four by Harry Brook 's ramp shot over the slips, leading to Pant's animated protest and subsequent actions that could breach multiple ICC Code of Conduct articles.The situation escalated when Pant, dissatisfied with the ball's condition, approached umpire Paul Reiffel for inspection. Despite Reiffel's examination with a ball gauge indicating no issues, Pant persisted in his appeal for a ball change.Upon the umpire's rejection of his request, Pant reacted by throwing the ball back-handed onto the ground before leaving the scene, prompting boos from the Headingley crowd.Former India coach Ravi Shastri, commenting on the incident, stated: ""When you start wanting to change the ball every now and then, it's a clear indication that nothing's happening. We want something to happen. And that was frustration from Pant."" Mark Butcher , co-commentator, responded: ""I'm not sure there was any need for that. (We) know that he's a showman and part of that is probably in order to get a reaction from the crowd, but I'm not sure Paul Reiffel appreciated it very much.""Pant's actions could potentially violate two specific articles of the ICC Code of Conduct. Article 2.8 addresses dissent at an umpire's decision, which could be classified as either a Level 1 or Level 2 offense, particularly under clause (a) for showing excessive disappointment and clause (h) for engaging in prolonged discussion about the decision.The second possible violation falls under Article 2.9, which specifically prohibits ""throwing a ball at or near an umpire in an inappropriate manner."" This offense also carries potential Level 1 and Level 2 sanctions.Quiz: Who's that IPL player?

“Mei bhi khel raha hu bhai! Apne chauke ke chakkar mei, mera chauka mat de dena.”

“Abhi ye pura confused hai Jaddu bhai! Kaunsi seedhi hai, kaunsi udhar ayega uska!”

India’s first Test against England at Headingley is turning into an instant classic — packed with big runs, sharp banter, and Jasprit Bumrah ’s record-breaking brilliance under cloudy skies.Day 2 saw India finish their imposing first innings at 471, anchored by Rishabh Pant ’s sparkling seventh Test century. But the momentum wobbled when the visitors lost their last seven wickets for just 41 runs. England, however, responded strongly, reaching 209/3 at stumps, with Ollie Pope steadying the innings with a classy hundred and Ben Duckett chipping in with a fighting 62.While the runs kept coming, the stump mic served up a bonus treat for fans:Pant, after a dramatic diving stop to save leg byes, quipped:(“I’m also playing, brother! Don’t give away my four while trying to save yours.”)👉 Captain Shubman Gill was fired up too, pumping up Jadeja from mid-off:(“Right now he’s totally confused, Jaddu brother! He can’t figure out which one will go straight and which one will turn.”)The drama continued on Day 3 as England pushed on to 465, closing the first innings just six runs behind India despite some sloppy Indian fielding as four catches were dropped off Bumrah alone. Still, India’s ace pacer turned up the heat, bagging a brilliant 5/83, his 14th Test five-for, equalling Kapil Dev’s record for most five-wicket hauls by an Indian in away Tests. He also became the bowler with the most five-wicket hauls in WTC history (11).Quiz: Who's that IPL player? With the ball swinging under overcast skies, India’s second innings had its own jitters.

“Whenever India needs a wicket, he delivers. He’s chalk and cheese above most bowlers. It’s his mind more than anything that just ticks as he knows how to pick up wickets,”

Sitanshu Kotak press conference: Big revelation on Shubman Gill

“When I first saw him at MI a young, thin, so shy and today, just look at him. India needs to wrap him in cotton wool, take care of him. He needs to be there in all the big matches because when he’s there, the bowling attack looks completely different.”

India’s fast-bowling maestro Jasprit Bumrah continues to redefine greatness every time he has the ball in hand, and his latest masterclass at Headingley has left both fans and former cricketers in awe.Following Bumrah ’s stunning 5-83, his 14th Test five-wicket haul and third in England, veteran wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik took to Instagram to shower praise on the pace spearhead and made a special appeal to the BCCI “There should be a separate contract for Bumrah — not Grade A, B, C or D — but something more than that!” Karthik said in his video message, echoing the sentiments of millions who watched Bumrah dismantle England’s batting line-up yet again.Calling him a “national treasure”, Karthik didn’t mince words in underlining Bumrah’s importance to Indian cricket.Karthik said.Recalling his first memories of a young, shy Bumrah at Mumbai Indians , Karthik marvelled at the bowler’s remarkable journey to becoming a world champion.Bumrah’s brilliance was the highlight of England’s first innings at Headingley, where the hosts were bowled out for 465, handing India a narrow six-run lead.

DROPPED CATCHES HURT INDIA

India’s Day 3 Test Review: Cloudy skies ahead | Weather twist at Headingley

BROOK LEADS ENGLAND’S COUNTERATTACK

BUMRAH’S BRILLIANCE

KL RAHUL IMPRESSES

Sitanshu Kotak press conference: Big revelation on Shubman Gill

NEW DELHI: Despite a valiant effort from Jasprit Bumrah and a fluent start by KL Rahul, India endured another patchy day in the field as England posted 465 in their first innings to nearly wipe out India’s advantage on Day 3 of the first Test at Headingley on Sunday.India ended the day at 90/2, leading by 96 runs, with KL Rahul (47)* and Shubman Gill (6)* unbeaten at stumps.India were let down by poor fielding once again, dropping five catches in the innings. The most glaring was when Yashasvi Jaiswal dropped Harry Brook for the third time in the match — on 82 — off Bumrah’s bowling.Earlier, Brook was dropped by Rishabh Pant on 46, and also survived after being bowled off a Bumrah no-ball on Day 2. He eventually fell for 99, pulling a short ball from Prasidh Krishna to Shardul Thakur at fine leg.Resuming at 209/3, England rode on Harry Brook’s aggressive 99 and Chris Woakes’ quickfire 38 to erase India’s lead. Brook was the standout with fearless strokeplay, launching even Bumrah for sixes over extra cover.England scored 138 runs in 23.4 overs in the extended afternoon session, regularly finding boundaries off an inconsistent Indian pace attack.Jasprit Bumrah was once again India’s saving grace. He claimed 5/83 in 24.4 overs, his 14th five-wicket haul in Tests and 10th in SENA countries, a milestone unmatched by any other Indian pacer.His spell ended England’s innings at 465, giving India a slender six-run first-innings lead.While Bumrah shone, the rest of India’s pace unit struggled. Prasidh Krishna picked up two wickets, including Brook and Jamie Smith, but conceded 128 runs in 20 overs, lacking variation and control.Shardul Thakur was barely used, and Ravindra Jadeja was curiously brought in late, despite extracting turn.Chasing quick runs before stumps, India lost Yashasvi Jaiswal (4) early to Brydon Carse, and Sai Sudharsan (30) again fell to Ben Stokes, who dismissed him twice in the match.But KL Rahul looked composed and elegant, striking seven boundaries, most through classic drives, as he remained unbeaten on 47 before rain stopped play.Throughout the innings, Indian players were visibly unhappy with the condition of the worn-out Dukes ball, and frequently appealed to the umpires for a change. After repeated refusals, the ball was eventually changed in the 75th over, just before the second new ball became available.India will hope for a solid batting effort on Day 4 to set up the match, while England will look to capitalise on any slip-ups. With conditions still favouring seam movement, the match is finely balanced heading into a potentially pivotal fourth day.","Jasprit Bumrah claimed 5/83 in 24.4 overs, his 14th five-wicket haul in Tests and 10th in SENA countries.

Ball in his right hand and sweater resting on his left, Jasprit Bumrah had his eyes locked on the giant screen, which was showing the replay of his fifth wicket. No bowler wants to miss the opportunity of seeing the ball crashing into the woodwork, and Bumrah admired the dismissal before acknowledging the standing ovation from a jam-packed Headingley. A gentle raise of the ball and the Indian spearhead walked into the dressing room after completing his 14th five-wicket haul in Tests.For 24.4 overs, Bumrah fought a lonely battle at Headingley. His fellow bowlers let him down, fielders let him down, but he kept picking himself up ball after ball, over after over. He would bury his face in his cap when a catch was dropped off his bowling and found it hard to even open his eyes after it happened again, but he maintained composure, stuck to the job, kept running in hard, and finished with a magnificent fifer.He would create pressure only to see a Prasidh Krishna or Mohammed Siraj bowl looseners from the other end. England kept ticking along because they knew there was only one Bumrah in the Indian XI, and he could only do so much. The state of current Indian bowling can draw parallels with Indian batting of the '90s — a one-man show. If it was Sachin Tendulkar versus the opposition, it is Bumrah versus the opposition now.Krishna picked three and Siraj scalped two, but together they conceded 250 runs in 47 overs.More than the runs conceded, it was the way they sprayed the ball over the place during crucial junctures of the game. Yes, Siraj looked good when the ball lost its lacquer on Day 2 but looked completely clueless on Day 3.As far as Krishna is concerned, he stuck to the short-ball ploy with the oldish Dukes and got the rewards, but when he erred with his lines, he was dispatched with disdain.The Indian team management's confidence in Shardul Thakur looked low because the all-rounder bowled only six overs — three on each day — out of the 100.4 overs sent down by the Indian bowlers.The script has that familiar feeling because it played out on numerous occasions during the Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) in Australia. Both Siraj and Krishna have played and traveled with the side enough to do the job from the other end.Yes, England's approach and the Bazball jazz are there, but the erratic lines and lengths are unexplainable at this level. India were very ordinary with the second new ball and allowed the opposition's lower order to add 114 runs in 20.4 overs before Bumrah was summoned for an over before the break to do his magic again.He didn't disappoint and picked two wickets in quick succession, but it was the other two seamers (because they never went towards the third) who were unable to create an impact, even in conditions — overcast and windy — which were ideal for the quicks. Bumrah carried the load in the first outing of the Leeds Test, but he will not be there forever — certainly not for more than three Tests of the series.Which ones are anybody's guess right now, but India need to start preparing for life without Bumrah, and prepare for it now. Handling of the new ball will be a serious concern, and it's important the experienced pro Siraj puts his hand up and steps up. Siraj is no stranger to bowling with the Dukes, and Krishna has had enough experience traveling with the team and playing with A sides.Bumrah continues to eat, sleep, pick wickets, and repeat, and it's about time others drill the same routine into their heads.","Bumrah carried the load in the first outing of the Leeds Test, but he will not be there forever — certainly not for more than three Tests of the series.
