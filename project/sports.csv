New Zealand secured a 58-run victory against India in the Women's T20 World Cup on Friday, ending India's innings at 102 runs in 19 overs. Captain Sophie Devine's impressive performance, scoring an unbeaten 57 off 36 balls with seven boundaries, was a key factor in New Zealand's total of 160-4.This win was only New Zealand’s second triumph in 14 T20 matches this year.In another match, South Africa dominated the West Indies, winning comfortably by 10 wickets.A brief pause occurred during the 14th over of the India-New Zealand match due to a run-out dispute involving Amelia Kerr. India believed Kerr was out while attempting a second run, but the umpires declared it a dead ball.Kerr had already headed towards the boundary before the fourth umpire made the final call. Despite India's objections, the decision stood unchanged. Kerr was subsequently caught on the next ball.Sophie Devine, supported by openers Georgia Plimmer and Suzie Bates, powered New Zealand's batting effort. Plimmer contributed 34 runs, and Bates added 27 runs, both dismissed while attempting aggressive shots.Devine reached her fourth T20 half-century, eventually scoring 67 runs off 46 balls. New Zealand managed to score 51 runs in the final five overs.India's predicament worsened when Rosemary Mair took four wickets for 19 runs, including the crucial wicket of India's captain, Harmanpreet Kaur, during the power play. Mair concluded India's innings by taking the last two wickets consecutively.Fast bowler Lea Tahuhu also made a significant impact, taking three wickets for 15 runs. Eden Carsen dismissed India's openers Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana early, putting India in a tough position with senior players losing their wickets quickly.In the other match, South Africa's Laura Wolvaardt (59 not out) and Tazmin Brits (57 not out) led a flawless chase, reaching 119 without loss with 13 balls remaining.Left-arm spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba delivered a career-best performance, taking 4-29 as West Indies was restricted to 118-6.The West Indies tried eight different bowlers but failed to dislodge Wolvaardt and Brits, who hit a combined 13 boundaries.Spinner Karishma Ramharack came closest to a breakthrough but failed to hold onto a sharp return catch when Wolvaardt was on 33.Earlier in the match, West Indies captain Hayley Matthews was out for 10 after edging an easy catch behind off Marizanne Kapp in the third over.Veteran Deandra Dottin, returning after a two-year hiatus, lasted for 11 deliveries, scoring 13 runs before being caught by Wolvaardt at extra cover trying to clear the circle against Kapp’s full-pitched delivery.Mlaba put the squeeze on the West Indies middle order and was on a hat trick after dismissing Shemaine Campbelle and Chinelle Henry, reducing them to 83-6 in 15 overs.Stafanie Taylor (44 not out) and Zaida James (15) managed to add 35 runs off the final 29 balls, but their total was far from sufficient.","New Zealand secured a 58-run victory against India in the Women's T20 World Cup on Friday, ending India's innings at 102 runs in 19 overs.

India's T20 World Cup triumph looked improbable when South Africa needed a run a ball in the final at Barbados earlier this year in June. But the turnaround happened, thanks to Surykumar Yadav's brilliant catch and Hardik Pandya's heroic spell, and India won the match by seven runs in the end to clinch the trophy.However, one story from that match, which nobody knew, was shared by Rohit Sharma on an episode of the comedy series 'The Great Indian Kapil Show'.A clever ploy by wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant to break the momentum of the South African batsmen was one of the factors that contributed to the game turning on its head, said the India captain, who retired from the T20Is after the victory.""They had a lot of wickets left. We were feeling the tension, but a captain needs to have a strong face at that moment,"" Rohit revealed on the show. ""No one knows this, there was a small break (when SA needed 26 off 24 balls). Rishabh Pant ne apna dimag lagaya aur game to rok diya (used his brain and delayed proceedings), saying he has a niggle in his knee and started getting it taped by the physio.""Rohit believes it worked in India's favour as the SA big-hitter Heinrich Klaasen was made to wait while he was blazing away.""At that moment, the batter wants the ball to be bowled quickly because he is in flow. We needed to break the rhythm. I was setting the field, talking to the bowler and then I saw Pant on the ground, the physio was there and Klaasen was waiting for resumption,"" Rohit added.""I'm not saying that was the reason for the win, but it could be. Pant used his brain.""Appearing on the show with Rohit were Suryakumar Yadav, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, and Arshdeep Singh.India had posted 176 for 7 on the board, thanks to Virat Kohli's half-century.Chasing a challenging total in the pressure match, Klaasen smashed 52 from just 27 balls to put South Africa on the brink of victory.But when play resumed after Pant had his knee taped, Pandya got rid of Klaasen next ball to bring India back in the match. David Miller fell soon after, which took India closer before they eventually won in the final over.",Rishabh Pant delayed getting his knee taped during the T20 World Cup final.

What India must do to qualify for semis

Victory over Pakistan (October 6): India's next match against Pakistan, who they have beaten 12 times in 15 encounters, is crucial. While India have a strong historical record against their rivals, they cannot afford complacency. Pakistan are high on confidence after beating Sri Lanka comfortably in their opening game. A comprehensive win here will boost both morale and their net run rate.

Crucial clash against Sri Lanka (October 9): Sri Lanka may pose a bigger challenge, having defeated India in the Asia Cup final in July. Despite India's overall dominance over Sri Lanka in T20 World Cups (losing only once), the team must aim for a large-margin win to maintain their semi-final chances.

Sri Lanka may pose a bigger challenge, having defeated India in the Asia Cup final in July. Despite India's overall dominance over Sri Lanka in T20 World Cups (losing only once), the team must aim for a large-margin win to maintain their semi-final chances. The big test against Australia (October 13): The most difficult hurdle comes in the form of Australia, who have won 25 of their 34 T20I encounters against India, including four of six meetings in T20 World Cups. India must find a way to overcome the dominant champions to secure their place in the top two of Group A.

Impact of other results

Australia vs New Zealand (October 8): A victory for Australia over New Zealand will create more room for India if they can beat both Pakistan and Sri Lanka by large margins. However, if New Zealand win, India's task becomes more complicated, as New Zealand could cement a top-two spot, leaving only one spot open for the remaining teams.

Pakistan vs New Zealand (October 14): If Pakistan defeat New Zealand, it could throw the group wide open, making net run rate even more critical. India's priority would then shift towards winning by significant margins to keep pace with the NRR of other teams in the group.

Net Run Rate challenges

NEW DELHI: India's hopes of reaching the semifinals of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup 2024 took a significant blow after their heavy 58-run defeat against New Zealand in Dubai on Friday.Entering the tournament as one of the favorites, India now face a challenging road to the knockout stages, with net run rate (NRR) becoming a critical factor in a tough Group A.The defeat has placed India in a precarious position. With only two teams from each group advancing to the semi-finals, Harmanpreet Kaur 's side now has no margin for error.Their group, featuring six-time winners and three-time defending champions Australia , a resurgent New Zealand, arch-rivals Pakistan , and Asia Cup champions Sri Lanka, leaves no easy path ahead.India must now win all their remaining three group-stage matches - against Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Australia - to stand any realistic chance of qualifying. While victories alone will help, the nature of those wins is equally important.India's current net run rate of -2.900, severely dented by the loss to New Zealand, means they must not only win but do so by significant margins to improve their NRR, especially if the qualification race becomes tight.India's fate isn't entirely in their hands. Other key group-stage results will play a pivotal role in determining semi-final spots:With India's NRR currently at -2.900, even three wins may not guarantee qualification if other results don't go their way. The team will need to capitalize on matches against Pakistan and Sri Lanka, both winnable encounters, by securing dominant victories to repair their NRR. In the worst-case scenario of multiple teams finishing with similar points, NRR will be the deciding factor for progression.","India's hopes of reaching the semifinals of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup 2024 took a significant blow after their 58-run defeat against New Zealand.

NEW DELHI: Harmanpreet Kaur-led India are gearing up to face New Zealand in their opening Group A match of the Women's T20 World Cup at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Friday. This marks the ninth edition of the tournament, with India still chasing their maiden T20 World Cup title. Their closest opportunity came in 2020 when they reached the final but were defeated by a dominant Australian side at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.Determined to put past disappointments behind them, India will look for a strong start to their campaign as they set their sights on erasing the memories of previous near-misses.Ahead of India's opening clash against New Zealand in Dubai, TimesofIndia.com spoke with Harmanpreet during an event hosted by Puma India. The Indian captain shared her thoughts on the team's title prospects, potential combinations, and more. Edited excerpts:You are putting pressure on us by saying this (laughs). We are really excited and want to give our best. The team has done really well and prepared a lot for this big tournament. We will not leave a single stone unturned. We are positive, and I am confident we will come through with flying colors.Yes, hopefully. That's our aim. As I said, we are prepared, we are positive, and we just want to go out and give our best. We always talk in the dressing room about how this is a great opportunity for us. I tell my team one thing: go and enjoy your game. That's it.If you ask me as a captain, all players are equally important to me. They have different roles to play on the field, and I know what they can bring to the table. For me, every single player is important. Whoever is in the middle must take responsibility and win the game for us.Earlier, the tournament was going to be played in Bangladesh, and now it will be held in the UAE. The conditions will be tough, and I will adjust the combinations accordingly.That's quite natural. It's not something exaggerated or out of the box. The aggression in me is natural. It drives me forward, and that’s how I've always been. Whenever I'm on the field, I just want to see my team win. This is the mindset I’ve played with throughout.Yes. She is the heart of the team. She’s always cheerful and ensures the dressing room environment remains lively. She keeps a big smile on every single player's face. It's really good to have her on the side. It's always great to have such players who bring energy to the team and the dressing room.It’s helping us a lot, just like the IPL helps men’s cricket. We've been waiting for this league for so many years. It's a massive platform for all women's cricketers. The WPL is a great stage and has brought a lot of talent to Indian cricket. I really loved playing in the WPL. Personally, this is something I’ve been waiting for a long time. Now that the platform is here, I'm enjoying every bit of it.","Harmanpreet Kaur-led India are gearing up to face New Zealand in their opening Group A match of the Women's T20 World Cup at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Friday.

Moving Forward Without Davante: ""Eyes on the Prize""



SiriusXM NFL Radio

“We wish Davante the best. At the end of the day, the focus of our guys is to show up every day. Come into practice willing to work and wanting to do whatever it takes to somehow get a victory this weekend,” Spillane said, making it clear that the Raiders' focus is on their next game, not the distractions swirling around Adams.

""Big-Time Plays Are Expected""



“We expect the guys replacing Davante to step up with big-time plays this weekend,” he said, adding that these aren’t just hopeful words—they’re the reality for a team looking to stay competitive.

Spillane’s Defensive Dominance



Rivalry Showdown: Raiders vs. Broncos



“Man, they’ve been great this year. Super disciplined. Coach [Vance] Joseph does a great job,” Minshew said, acknowledging the formidable challenge the Broncos defense poses.

“I mean, what are they second in the league in sacks or first? It starts there.”

Antonio Pierce’s Next Challenge



The clock is ticking, and soon the NFL world will learn where Davante Adams , the star wide receiver, will call his next home. For the Las Vegas Raiders, it’s been a wild ride. They’ve enjoyed the best of Adams, but the trade saga surrounding him has cast a long shadow over the team. With Adams seemingly on his way out, linebacker Robert Spillane made it clear the Raiders are already looking ahead.Their mantra? ""Next man up.""Also read - Davante Adams Speaks Out on Trade Rumors Amid Raiders' Struggles In an interview with, Robert Spillane opened up about how the Raiders are tuning out the noise and focusing on what’s ahead. When asked about Adams' impending departure, Spillane didn’t mince words:With Adams likely gone, the team isn't dwelling on the past but gearing up for a future without their star receiver.Spillane didn’t just talk about the team’s mindset moving forward, he also addressed the players stepping up in Adams’ absence. The expectations are high, and Spillane emphasized that filling the void Adams leaves behind won’t be an option—it’s a necessity.The Raiders need their roster to rise to the occasion if they want to stay in the playoff conversation, and the pressure is on to perform, starting with their next game.While the offense figures out its new dynamic without Adams, Spillane and the defense have been making headlines of their own. The linebacker has been a beast on the field, racking up double-digit tackles in every game this season. His relentless effort is a testament to the hard work and preparation instilled by defensive coordinator Patrick Graham.But even with Spillane’s stellar performance, the defense is gearing up for a bigger test in the coming weeks.Next up for the Raiders (2-2) is a pivotal AFC West matchup against the Denver Broncos (2-2). It’s a rivalry that never disappoints, and both teams are hungry to tip the scales in their favor. Spillane knows the importance of this game, and so does Raiders quarterback Gardner Minshew II .Raiders offensive coordinator Luke Getsy echoed the sentiment, praising Denver’s defensive prowess:The Broncos thrive on pressure, and the Raiders will need to find a way to break through.With Adams’ trade saga coming to an end and injury concerns like Tyreik McAllister’s availability up in the air, Raiders head coach Antonio Pierce has a lot to think about. The team's future without their star receiver presents a new set of challenges, and Pierce will need to make some bold moves to keep the Raiders on track.As the dust settles on the Davante Adams chapter, the Raiders will need every player, coach, and leader to step up, adapt, and focus on what's next. The road ahead won’t be easy, but if Spillane’s words are any indication, the Raiders are ready for the fight.Also read - ""Amid Davante Adams Trade Drama, Fans Warn Shedeur Sanders: 'Don’t Waste Your Talent in Vegas!'""",Raiders linebacker Robert Spillane says the team is focused on the next game.

'NOTHING WENT RIGHT FOR INDIA'

NEW DELHI: The disappointment was clear on India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur and her team after their hopes of reaching the knockouts of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup took a severe blow with a 58-run defeat against New Zealand at the Dubai International Stadium on Friday.India, who entered the tournament as one of the title favorites, now face a tough challenge against arch-rivals Pakistan.Pakistan are riding high on confidence after a comfortable victory over Sri Lanka in their opening game.India's next match against Pakistan, whom they have beaten 12 times in 15 encounters, is crucial. Although India have a strong historical record against Pakistan, they cannot afford to be complacent.Former India captain Anjum Chopra believes the pressure will be on India, but Harmanpreet and her team know how to turn things around.""Harmanpreet alone is not under pressure. Harman, as a player and captain, has been in such scenarios and situations before. I don't think she will be under pressure, but the players in the team who have not performed to their abilities or underperformed in the last game must be feeling the pressure and must be thinking about how they can turn things around,"" Anjum told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.""Everyone will be thinking in their respective corners about how they can perform better and put India's campaign back on track. Everyone in the team needs to pitch in aggressively, sharpen their skills, and be ready for the next game against Pakistan,"" the former skipper said.India are in Group A alongside Australia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and New Zealand.India now must win all three of their remaining group-stage matches—against Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Australia—to have any realistic chance of qualifying for the knockouts.Anjum emphasized the need for India to put their dismal defeat against New Zealand behind them and start afresh.""In tournaments like the World Cup, especially when you are in a tough group, there is a lot of pressure. In the process, you win some and you lose some. We knew that the group was tough. Every single team in the World Cup is competitive. You just need to believe in yourself and use your cards—your players—wisely. Yes, India can make a comeback,"" Anjum said.""They need to forget what happened against New Zealand and come all guns blazing in their remaining matches. They need to ensure they beat every single team now to enter the knockouts and remain in the contest. If New Zealand had lost their first match, they would have been under pressure. Similarly, India are under immense pressure after losing their opening game to New Zealand. The pressure will be on India. At the end of the day, it's the World Cup; the pressure has to be there. It's not like you come into the tournament and just take the trophy home,"" she said.India's current net run rate of -2.900, severely impacted by their loss to New Zealand, means they not only need to win but must do so by substantial margins to improve their net run rate (NRR), especially if the qualification race tightens.Besides Pakistan, India will face Sri Lanka and the formidable Australia in their remaining group matches. The top two teams from each group will advance to the semifinals.Anjum stressed that India needs a better strategy against Pakistan to revive their campaign.""You don't come into a competition targeting just one opposition; you have to beat many teams to reach the semis and then beat the best to win the final. I agree there is a lot at stake when it's India vs Pakistan . Fans expect a lot. There are emotions. As a player or captain, it is not just one team you want to perform against—you have to beat every single team,"" Anjum said.""Yes, the pressure will be there, but if you want to enter the knockouts, you need to look at things differently, whether it's Pakistan or Australia or any other team. India need to go with a better plan against Pakistan. They need to improve their game plan,"" she said.India's NRR took a heavy blow after their 58-run loss to New Zealand.New Zealand had lost 10 matches in a row coming into this World Cup, but they dominated India in a one-sided contest to get their campaign off to a flying start.Opting to bat first, New Zealand posted a challenging 160 for 4, thanks to a superb unbeaten 57 off 36 balls by skipper Sophie Devine.In response, India’s batting collapsed early, with wickets tumbling at regular intervals as they were bowled out for 102 runs.""I don't think anything went right for India. From the very first over till the end, they were playing catch-up. They were surprised by New Zealand’s onslaught and approach. It looked like, and it was visible, that India didn't have any plan of action other than anticipating that New Zealand would lose wickets or get out for a low score. There was no Plan B for India. New Zealand played excellent cricket . They didn't allow India to come into the contest,"" Anjum said.""New Zealand's 160 was not a difficult target to chase. India have chased that in the past, but the Indian batters didn't perform well. They didn't take up the challenge and failed. Yes, the bowlers didn't have their day, but the batters could have done their job, and they faltered. Nothing went right for them,"" she said.","India's hopes of reaching the knockouts of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup took a severe blow with a 58-run defeat against New Zealand.

India's T20 World Cup triumph under Rohit Sharma won India the ICC silverware in the shortest format 17 years after MS Dhoni's team clinched the trophy in the tournament's inaugural edition in 2007. But it looked unlikely when South Africa were in complete control of the run-chase in the final earlier this year in Barbados, until Hardik Pandya struck to change the momentum.It was the first ball of the 17th over that triggered the shift in momentum.Chasing India's 176 for 7, Heinrich Klaasen (52 off 27 balls) was threatening to take the game away from India. With the Proteas having six wickets in hand and Klaasen going great guns alongside David Miller, India had their backs to the wall. But Pandya struck at the start of a fresh over to remove Klaasen.Talking about the climax of the final on the episode of comedy series 'The Great Indian Kapil Show', Rohit revealed what was happening in the middle between the two teams, which was beyond the battle between bat and ball.After India had Klaasen back in the hut, the Indian team decided to get under the skin of the South Africans through verbal volleys.""Hum saare ladko ne ek saath aa ke unke batsmen ko ek do cheezein boli, woh mai abhi yahan pe nahi share kar sakta hu, par woh karhna zaruri tha kyuki woh match humko kaise bhi karke jeetna tha (we all said a few things to their batsmen, which I can't share but it was important to do that because we wanted to win at any cost),"" said Rohit about India's thrilling seven-run victory.""Even if we get fined after winning, that's not a problem. That was in my mind. So I told the boys 'jisko jo bolna hai bolo bindaas, umpires and referees ko hum baad mei handle karenge (just say whatever you want to say, we will handle the umpires and referees later),"" Rohit revealed, sending the audience into splits.Appearing with Rohit on the comedy show were his teammates Suryakumar Yadav, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel and Arshdeep Singh.Hardik ended the match with a dream spell, which also included the wicket of Miller, who was South Africa's last hope and was left heartbroken to see Suryakumar Yadav pulling off a terrific catch at the edge of the boundary.Rohit and Virat Kohli announced their retirement from T20Is after India's victory.",India beat South Africa in the T20 World Cup final in Barbados.

India need to improve in every department to beat resurgent Pakistan

There's always a lot riding on an India-Pakistan contest. Everyone talks it up as the 'the greatest rivalry,' but when it comes to women's cricket, the Indians have a bit of a runaway lead. The 12-3 head to head in T20s does look lop-sided, but there's a little more than what meets the eye for the Sunday clash at the Dubai International Stadium.The humiliating loss to New Zealand on Friday has left India unsettled while Pakistan come into this game after a commanding victory against Sri Lanka.It's a tough group with Australia waiting and a loss in this game will put the Women in Blue's campaign in peril. With that in mind, Harmanpreet Kaur 's girls need to step up in every department to keep their hopes alive in the T20 World Cup.While the Indian fielding in their 58-run defeat to NZ was way below-par, it was the batting that was shambolic. In a chase of 161, the likes of Shafali Verma, Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet looked all at sea, unable to deal with the two-paced pitch. Jemimah Rodrigues , another star player, too couldn't make an impact and she stressed on the need to pick themselves up quickly. ""We would like to forget Friday's game because this is a World Cup. We can't stay stuck in this game. We know every game from here is so crucial for us,"" Jemimah said.The Indian bowlers also need to take charge and analyse the pitch better. Leg-spinner Asha Shobhana , fresh off a promising debut, will look to make a greater impact. Meanwhile, Pooja Vastrakar with the new ball and Arund hati Reddy, who replaced Radha Yadav , will be itching to get the early wickets.Pakistan, on the other hand, are flying high after an allround performance that led to a 31-run victory against Asia Cup champions Sri Lanka. Their spinners were in their elements defending 116 and the confidence that they gained from the game could be crucial, especially on a pitch where the spinners normally hold sway.Under the leadership of their new captain Fatima Sana , who excelled in all aspects of the game, Pakistan possess a formidable player capable of challenging India. Sana scored a quickfire 30 off 20 balls in their first game, but she wants her batters to take the game on.",India need to improve in every department to beat resurgent Pakistan.

(TOI Photo)

GWALIOR : The last time this city, known for its palaces and royal Scindia lineage, hosted an international cricket match, history was made.On February 24, 2010, at the Captain Roop Singh Stadium, the legendary Sachin Tendulkar became the first cricketer to score a double century in ODIs-a breathtaking, unbeaten 200 off 147 balls.More than 14 years later, international cricket is set to return to Gwalior, this time at a brand-new venue-the Shrimant Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Stadium.Located on the outskirts of the city along the Mumbai-Agra highway, this stadium will become the latest venue in India to host international cricket. This match will also mark India's first home T20 match since winning their second T20 World Cup in June in the West Indies.Led by Suryakumar Yadav , India, with just four players from the squad that clinched the marquee event, will use this series to begin preparations for defending their title in the 2026 T20 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka. Several fringe players will get their chance to audition, hoping to make an impression like Delhi's express pacer Mayank Yadav, Harshit Rana, also from the same state and Andhra allrounder Nitish Reddy.A major storyline will be the comeback of Kolkata Knight Riders' spinner Varun Chakravarthy , who last played for India in Nov 2021 against Scotland. A stellar performance in IPL 2024 has earned Chakravarthy a recall, where his tricky bowling could once again trouble opponents.One surprise from the selection table was the exclusion of Ruturaj Gaikwad , despite his strong T20I record. With both Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill rested, India will look to wicketkeeper-batsman Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma to step up.On the other side, Bangladesh, still smarting from their 2-0 Test series defeat, will be looking to hit the reset button in the T20s. With the team moving beyond the Shakib Al Hasan era, captain Najmul Shanto will need to lead by example. Bangladesh will also count on the experience of Mahmudullah.","International cricket set to return to Gwalior, this time at a brand-new venue.

NEW DELHI: Speed sensation Mayank Yadav played just four Indian Premier League (IPL) matches for Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) last season, but the impact he created in them was good enough for the Indian selectors to fast-track him into the Indian T20I team.As Mayank rattled the top batters from around the world in the IPL with his sheer pace -- consistently hitting 150 kph mark -- India T20I skipper Suryakumar Yadav sees the X-factor in the young star.In the IPL, Mayank hit 156.7kph -- the fastest delivery in the league -- against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and for India T20I captain, the series against Bangladesh is a chance for Mayank to make an impact.Surya said he did not play him in the practice sessions in Gwalior; but like everyone else, he was impressed with the speedster.""The series is a good chance for the youngsters. Mayank has that X-factor and others as well. I have not played in my nets thus far. But have seen his potential and the impact he can make,"" said the skipper.Surya, however, did not disclose whether the 22-year-old will make his debut in the opener or not.""We were discussing the team just now. If you asked me 10 minutes later I would have told you whether he would play or not. But surely he has that extra pace. Need to manage him properly.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Mohammad Kaif has expressed strong support for a new rule change in Indian Premier League (IPL) that could potentially benefit MS Dhoni , allowing the former Chennai Super Kings CSK ) captain to continue playing in the IPL beyond 2024.Under this rule, players who have not represented the Indian national team for five years will be treated as ""uncapped"" players, regardless of their past achievements.Dhoni, who last played for India in the 2019 World Cup, qualifies under this reclassification for the 2025 IPL season.Speaking on Star Sports, Kaif voiced his approval for this adjustment, emphasizing Dhoni's immense influence on the game.""You will get the chance to see MS Dhoni again. He is fit, batting at a strike rate of 200, keeping well, and that is why I believe the rules will keep changing till he wishes to play. If he wants to play in the IPL, he will play. He is such a big player, such a big match-winner, and has been a leader for CSK,"" Kaif said.Furthermore, Kaif noted how the financial aspect doesn't concern Dhoni.He referenced Dhoni's own words, “I believe the rule has been changed rightly. And Dhoni himself says, 'I don’t need money, I’ll adjust to whatever the team decides.' Even if he gets 4 crore as an uncapped player (Paise chahe 4 crore mil rahe ho as an uncapped player), it doesn't matter to him. It sounds strange to say because 4 crore isn't much for him.

Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar has joined America's National Cricket League (NCL) ownership group, a move that is expected to give a big boost to the sport in the United States in the coming years. ""Cricket has been my life's greatest journey and I am pleased to join the National Cricket League at such an exciting time for the sport in the US,"" Tendulkar said after the NCL announced that the batting legend has joined them.""The NCL's vision to create a platform for world-class cricket while inspiring a new generation of fans to resonate with me.

NEW DELHI: Former India and Chennai Super Kings captain MS Dhoni is set to meet with team owners in mid-October where he is expected to finalize his decision on whether he will play the upcoming season of Indian Premier League IPL ).According to a report from Cricbuzz, legendary Dhoni, who recently returned to India after a trip to the US, will sit down with CSK 's management in Mumbai to discuss his future role ahead of the IPL 2025 mega auction.While Dhoni remains tight-lipped about his plans, CSK have not yet confirmed his participation for the upcoming season, keeping fans and pundits in suspense.A final decision will be made after this meeting, which will be pivotal for the team’s strategy going into the auction.Dhoni’s legacy with CSK, where he has led the franchise to five IPL titles, makes his decision particularly significant.In a move to push Dhoni to play another IPL season, the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) recently implemented a new rule that allows players who haven't represented India for more than five years to be classified as 'uncapped' players.This change applies to Dhoni, who last played for India in 2019. As a result, Dhoni could now be retained by CSK as an uncapped player for a base price of Rs 4 crore.Former Indian cricketer Mohammad Kaif publicly backed the rule change, suggesting that it paves the way for Dhoni to continue playing in the IPL.Speaking on Star Sports, Kaif emphasized Dhoni's enduring impact on the game, stating, ""If Dhoni wants to play, he will play. He’s such a big match-winner and leader for CSK.""Kaif also pointed out that the financial aspect isn’t a concern for Dhoni.Referring to Dhoni’s previous comments, Kaif highlighted, ""Dhoni himself says he doesn’t need the money, and even if he’s retained for Rs 4 crore, it wouldn’t matter to him.""The IPL’s new retention rules allow teams to keep up to six players before the 2025 auction, giving CSK the opportunity to secure their iconic leader.With an increased auction purse of Rs 120 crore, this change gives teams like CSK greater flexibility in crafting their squad for the next IPL cycle.",MS Dhoni is set to meet with team owners in mid-October.

SHARJAH: Spinners Linsey Smith and Charlie Dean took two wickets apiece as England defeated Bangladesh by 21 runs for a winning start to their Women's T20 World Cup campaign on Saturday.England's strategy to play four spinners paid dividends as the 2009 champions restricted Bangladesh to 97-7 on a slow track in Sharjah as they managed to defend their lowest total in T20 World Cups.England had made 118-7, riding on a 40-ball 41 by opener Danni Wyatt-Hodge.Middle-order batter Sobhana Mostary played a lone hand for Bangladesh, making 44 off 48 balls, including a huge six off Dean over deep square leg.The result was a disappointment for Bangladesh, who won against Scotland in the tournament opener on Thursday for their first T20 World Cup win in a decade.""We missed a good opportunity to beat a good side. Our bowlers did a good job but our batters disappointed,"" said Bangladesh captain Nigar Sultana.""On this kind of a surface, we needed to have a good partnership. We did not have a good powerplay, we gave away wickets.""England, who chose to bat first, started off cautiously before Wyatt-Hodge and Maia Bouchier (23) opened up to play some memorable shots.""It was tough out there, conditions were tough for batting and boundary-hitting.

Tanush Kotian hundred helps Mumbai clinch Irani Cup after 27 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/tanush-kotian-hundred-helps-mumbai-clinch-irani-cup-after-27-years/articleshow/113970967.cms,"Tanush Kotian (Screengrab)

khadoos

LUCKNOW: Tanush Kotian comes across as a soft-spoken person and always maintains a calm demeanour. But once he steps onto the field, his drive to succeed is unmatchable.On Saturday, that drive came to Mumbai’s rescue once again, as his century played a crucial role in guiding Mumbai to their 15th Irani Cup title on a first-innings lead against Rest of India at the BRSABV Ekana Cricket Stadium.Kotian scored an unbeaten 114 off 150 balls, including 10 fours and one six, to bring up his second First-Class century. The 25-year-old, hailing from Mumbai's central suburb of Vikhroli, along with Mohit Avasthi (51*, 93b; 4x4, 1x6), shared a partnership of 158 for the ninth wicket—the highest for that position in the competition's history.Interestingly, Mumbai's last Irani Cup title also came on the same date—October 5—27 years ago, during the 1997-98 season opener when they defeated RoI by 54 runs. Since then, they had been on the losing side eight times.Mumbai began Day Five at 156/6 with a 274-run lead. Getting off to a good start was crucial if they were to bat out RoI, who had the firepower to chase a target of around 300. However, things didn't start well as RoI off-spinner Saransh Jain (6/121) trapped first-innings double centurion Sarfaraz Khan (17) leg-before and then got Shardul Thakur stumped, reducing Mumbai to 171/8.It wouldn't be wrong to say that Mumbai's dressing room might have been on edge at this point. But as the Kotian-Avasthi partnership flourished, they relaxed and applauded every run. RoI was guilty of sloppy fielding, dropping Kotian three times—on 31, 50, and 53. With the lead stretching to 450 and the possibility of a result diminishing, both teams agreed to shake hands before the tea break.Mumbai skipper Ajinkya Rahane heaped praise on Kotian: “He is a special talent, and it’s just a matter of time before he plays for India. The most important thing is, he’s a team man. That’s the best quality of Tanush, and he’s a tremendously hard-working guy,” said Rahane.Lately, Kotian has had people approach him and talk about his chances of making it to the Indian team, but his sole focus remains on the game. “Yes, a lot of people talk about it, but I don’t think too much about playing for India. I hope I will play one day, but when on the field, I always focus on what I can do best for the team—whether bowling or batting.”Last year, Kotian was named the Ranji Trophy Player of the Tournament, finishing as Mumbai’s second-highest scorer with 502 runs—mostly coming at No. 8—and most of them scored when the chips were down, much like on Saturday. He was also the third-highest wicket-taker with 29 scalps.So how does he always end up rescuing his team? “I know my game very well, so I back myself to score those runs (or take wickets). I don’t enter the field thinking I’ve to play defensively. My first instinct is to always dominate the bowlers, keep them under pressure, and once they bowl a loose ball, I capitalize on it.”Mumbai Cricket Association president Ajinkya Naik said: “Mumbai demonstrated an outstanding example of grit and determination. The boys upheld the tradition of playing khadoos cricket. It was a perfect display of teamwork, with each player fulfilling their role brilliantly.”When Mumbai started Day Three with just four bowlers, due to Shardul Thakur being down with fever, many would have thought they were staring down the barrel. But in the end, Mumbai’sattitude came to the fore, which took them over the line.","Mumbai captain Ajinkya Rahane hails Tanush Kotian as a'special talent' Kotian scored 114 off 150 balls, including 10 fours and one six, to bring up his second First-Class century.

You’ll come to know soon: Suryakumar Yadav on Mumbai Indians captaincy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/youll-come-to-know-soon-suryakumar-yadav-on-mumbai-indians-captaincy/articleshow/113970751.cms,"<p>Suryakumar Yadav (Photo credit: BCCI/IPL)<br></p>

Mayank is special, has ‘X’ factor

GWALIOR: At a time when the franchisees are busy finalising their retentions, potential captains, coaching staff and even the auction strategy, India’s T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav dropped enough hints that he is interested in becoming the captain of his high-profile franchise, the Mumbai Indians too.There has been much speculation about whether MI would retain allrounder Hardik Pandya, who led them in IPL-2024, as their captain in IPL-2025 too.A few months back, the national selectors, in a much talked about decision, had replaced Pandya with ‘SKY’ as India’s T20 captain.On Saturday, on the eve of the first T20I between India and Bangladesh at the Shrimant Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Stadium here, Suryakumar refused to duck a question on whether he would want to be the MI captain going forward, even though he didn’t say anything definitive. “Aapne googly daal diya (laughs),” he giggled while gesturing the grip of a leggie while bowling the googly.He then said, “(I’m) Really enjoying this new role (as India’s T20 captain). When I was playing under Rohit bhai’s captaincy in MI, I used to give my inputs whatever I felt at that time. For India (captaining) also, (I’m) feeling good. I captained against Sri Lanka previously, and against Australia and South Africa also. I have learnt from other captains on how to take the team forward.” Turning into his typical witty mode again in the IPL leadership query, Surya said, “Aage dekhte hain. Chalte rehta hain (laughs). Baaki aapko pata toh chal hee jayega (laughs), (Let’s see what happens in the future. This keeps going on. You’ll come to know soon)”.The BCCI has asked the franchises to name their retentions by October 31, so a decision regarding MI captaincy can perhaps be expected sometime this month.When Surya, amongst the top three-four most destructive batsmen in the world in T20 cricket, terms a bowler as ‘special,’ and an ‘X factor,’ you better believe that man has indeed got to be good.Using words that tell you how thrilled the Indian team is at the prospective debut of Delhi and Lucknow Super Giants tearaway fast bowler Mayank Yadav, who has been fast-tracked into India’s T20I team after he impressed with relentless pace and accuracy in IPL-2024, India’s T20 captain showered praise on the young fast bowler.“It’s (this series) a great opportunity for youngsters.

I haven’t faced him in the nets thus far, but he is special. We have seen his potential and the impact (that) he can make,” Surya said.Asserting that the injury-prone pacer, who has been out of action since April due to a side strain, was fully fit now, Surya said, “You have to manage players well, BCCI has started to work on managing players. We have to nurture players like him, he is a special talent. Mayank is fully fit and fine right now.”Quizzed on whether Yadav will make his debut on Sunday, Surya said, “We were discussing the team just now. If you asked me 10 minutes later, I would have told you whether he would play or not. But surely, he has that extra pace. He is a good addition to the Indian team (We) Need to manage him properly. There is a lot of cricket going on, both international and domestic.”The Indian captain confirmed that ‘keeper Sanju Samson will open with Abhishek Sharma in the series. He also didn’t rule out the possibility of bowling a couple of overs in this series, like he did in the final T20I against Sri Lanka at Pallekele, where he took 2-5 in one over of part-time spin. “It can only be good If we can get a couple of overs from the batters.

LIVERPOOL: Anthony Gordon missed a penalty against his former side to spark an almighty roar from the home fans as Newcastle United were held to a 0-0 draw by Everton in a feisty Premier League clash at Goodison Park on Saturday.Newcastle were correctly awarded a spot-kick in the first half when James Tarkowski hauled down Sandro Tonali in the box, but Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford saved Gordon's poor penalty with his legs.The visitors had several other chances to win the game and were the better side, but Everton might have taken all three points themselves as they had an Abdoulaye Doucoure header ruled out for offside and Idrissa Gueye missed an open goal.The point leaves Newcastle in sixth place in the standings with 12 points from their seven matches, while Everton are in 16th place with five points.Gordon was the villain of the piece for both sets of fans following his acrimonious exit from Goodison Park last year.He also had a chance late on when faced with just Pickford to beat from a narrow angle but fired over the crossbar.""We will always back Gordan to score them, he has been an amazing player for us since he signed,"" Newcastle defender Dan Burn said. ""It is one of those things. We wanted to pull a result out for him because he is hurting a bit.""It was a better performance away from home. We battled well but I am disappointed not to get the three points.""Newcastle came close when Bruno Guimaraes' shot at the back post beat Pickford but not Iliman Ndiaye on the goal line.Doucoure had the ball in the net from a sumptuous James Garner cross but was a yard offside, before Tarkowski's moment of madness gifted Newcastle the opportunity for the opener.The foul was not spotted immediately, but a VAR review saw the penalty awarded, only for Gordon to go low and just off centre to his right, allowing Pickford to make what was a comfortable save in the end.It was a joyous moment for Everton fans as a chorus of ""England's number one"" went around the ground.""I watched the game last week and he reversed it against (Manchester City's) Ederson and I fancied him going keeper's left,"" Pickford said. ""I think he will be disappointed but I am there to make the save and that's what I did.""Guimaraes scooped the ball over the bar from 15 yards before Everton had a penalty shout of their own when Dominic Calvert-Lewin looked to be impeded by Burn as he went to shoot.The officials thought otherwise and from the follow-up Gueye missed a sitter when he blazed over from eight yards.""We weren't at our best but we were resilient and we had to dig in,"" Pickford said. ""We wanted three points but to not lose the game is great and it is our first clean sheet.""",Newcastle held to 0-0 draw by Everton at Goodison Park. Anthony Gordon misses a penalty against his former side. Abdoulaye Doucoure had a header ruled out for offside. Idrissa Gueye missed an open goal.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113978085,imgsize-144548,width-400,resizemode-4/113978085.jpg"

Carvajal hurt

Fede Valverde and Vinicius Junior strikes helped Real Madrid bounce back from their first defeat since January with a 2-0 win over Villarreal on Saturday in La Liga .Los Blancos lost in the Champions League at Lille but are still unbeaten in the Spanish top flight and moved level with leaders Barcelona, before the Catalans visit Alaves on Sunday.Valverde's deflected effort and a rocket from Vinicius allowed Madrid to put a four-point gap between them and their third-placed opponents, who battled well but came up fractionally short in the capital.Madrid's victory was marred by a late injury to defender Dani Carvajal, who had to be taken off on a stretcher.""It seems a serious knee injury, it will be looked at in the coming hours,"" Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told reporters.""The players are sad, worried, because something happened that happens a lot, because of the (busy) calendar, and it happened to a very, very important player for us.""Ancelotti said Vinicius would also have medical tests after being taken off late on with discomfort in his shoulder and neck.The Italian coach started Kylian Mbappe after the French striker had recovered from a thigh problem.The former Paris Saint-Germain striker could only appear from the bench in Madrid's disappointing midweek display.Mbappe, who France have not selected for upcoming Nations League fixtures, was quiet at the Santiago Bernabeu as his team ground out victory with a determined, rather than inspiring, performance.Madrid are still missing German midfielder Toni Kroos, although on this occasion he was watching on from a box.Mbappe sent an early volley off-target from Luka Modric's corner but it was midfield powerhouse Valverde who broke the deadlock after 14 minutes.The Uruguayan's drive from distance deflected off Villarreal playmaker Alex Baena and arced beyond the reach of goalkeeper Diego Conde.The visitors, enjoying a strong start to the season under coach Marcelino Garcia Toral, came close when Nicolas Pepe's header clipped the top of the crossbar.Mbappe had one further chance, bursting into the area with his electric pace, but goalkeeper Conde managed to dispossess him with an outstretched leg.Villarreal appealed for a penalty early in the second half when Aurelien Tchouameni, playing at centre-back, pulled down Barry, but the French striker was offside.Baena hit the side-netting of Andriy Lunin's goal with a free-kick, nearly catching out the Ukrainian goalkeeper standing in for the injured Thibaut Courtois.Vinicius flashed a shot narrowly wide, before his strike partner Mbappe was replaced with 20 minutes to go by Rodrygo Goes.Brazil striker Vinicius, who is hoping to win a first Ballon d'Or later in October, netted the second with a superb effort from outside the area, which ripped into the top corner.In stoppage time, Spanish right-back Carvajal suffered an injury while attempting to clear the ball under pressure from Yeremi Pino.""In the end, the result's a less important thing -- Dani's health is what matters,"" Valverde told Real Madrid TV.""The game was fine, it was neither very good or bad, it was what we had to do to win, two goals was enough.""Villarreal defender Raul Albiol was also concerned about Carvajal.""It looked bad... let's hope it's the least (damage) possible, because we all know how important he is for Real Madrid and Spanish football ,"" he said.The centre-back said Madrid were efficient with their finishing and that made the difference.""They have a lot of attacking punch and more or less with three chances they had two goals,"" he said.Earlier, nine-man Celta Vigo earned a 1-0 win at bottom-of-the-table Las Palmas.The Canary Islanders were unable to record their first win of the season even after Ilaix Moriba and Iago Aspas' red cards for Celta, who climbed to ninth thanks to Borja Iglesias' goal.Osasuna moved into fifth with a 1-1 draw at Getafe, while Espanyol beat Mallorca 2-1 and Rayo Vallecano won at Valladolid by the same score.",Real Madrid beat Villarreal 2-0 in La Liga. Goals fromede Valverde and Vinicius Junior. Dani Carvajal taken off on stretcher with knee injury.

JFC come back to winning ways as EB lose 4th game in a row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/jfc-come-back-to-winning-ways-as-eb-lose-4th-game-in-a-row/articleshow/113971039.cms,"Rei Tachikawa (centre) with teammates after scoring the opener in Jamshedpur on Saturday (Photo credit: JFC)

Starting their league campaign with a hat-trick of losses, East Bengal travelled to Jamshedpur over the weekend hoping to finally reverse their fortunes in the Indian Super League under their interim coach Bino George.But it was not to be as Jamshedpur FC beat the visitors 2-0 to grab their third win of the season at JRD Tata Sports Complex on Saturday and go third on the table with nine points from four matches.First, Rei Tachikawa, a bit out of touch in their previous outings, scored a screamer from outside the box in the 21st minute to put the hosts in lead.Mohammed Sanan was trying to create a move down the left flank but his shot was blocked and it fell to Tachikawa. The Japanese player then made space for himself and took the shot with his right foot towards the near post. Debjit Majumder made a full-length dive to his right but was unable to get his hands to it.While it was indeed a brilliant strike, the East Bengal defence should have done better to make sure Tachikawa didn’t get a clear shot.Later, in the 70th minute, Jamshedpur doubled their lead after Lalchungnunga scored an own goal when he tried to block Imran Khan’s cross from right, intended for Jordan Murray at far post.The Mizoram defender looked distraught after conceding the goal and it kind of summed up the night for the red and golds. Not only did they make defensive errors but also missed numerous chances including a penalty by Saul Crespo in the 64th minute.The Spaniard took a few steps, stuttered and then delivered a weak shot towards the left post which JFC goalkeeper Albino Gomes had no trouble in collecting. The red and gold fans, who had turned up in numbers, looked shell shocked.It got even worse for them when JFC doubled their lead few minutes later.However, East Bengal still had a couple of chances as the match progressed but it was just not their day. Two minutes after JFC took the lead, Hector Yuste’s header hit the crossbar. Then in the 81st minute, Gomes made a superb save to deny Madih Talal from scoring from distance.Talal was clearly the best player for East Bengal and on any other day he might have scored more than one but Jamshedpur’s wall wasn’t to be breached on Saturday.And for that a lot of credit should go to Gomes, who had a brilliant game under the bar. The defenders also put their bodies on the lines as the Men of Steel earned their first clean sheet of the season.Imran once again was impressive on the right and his long balls were spot on. From one of his crosses Murray had a great chance to score but his header went straight to Majumder.Despite all the good news, there is a small injury concern that coach Khalid Jamil will be worried about. Tachikawa was forced to leave the filed in the 33rd minute holding his right back. It looked painful but with the international break coming up JFC will be relieved that they won’t have to take the field till Oct 21.",Jamshedpur FC beat East Bengal 2-0 in the Indian Super League on Saturday. Rei Tachikawa and Lalchungnunga scored the goals for the hosts. It was the Men of Steel's third win of the season.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113971230,imgsize-43574,width-400,resizemode-4/113971230.jpg"
Shocking! Cristiano Ronaldo not among footballers with most trophies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/shocking-cristiano-ronaldo-not-among-footballers-with-most-trophies/articleshow/113964965.cms,"Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo (Photo Credits: X)

NEW DELHI: Lionel Messi , often hailed as one of the greatest footballers of all time (GOAT), has solidified his legendary status by becoming the player with the most trophies in football history, boasting an unprecedented 46 career titles, while Cristiano Ronaldo is nowhere to be seen in the top five.Messi’s journey to this monumental achievement began at FC Barcelona , where he spent 17 glittering years (2004-2021) and won 35 titles.His trophy cabinet at the Catalan club includes 10 La Liga titles, four UEFA Champions League trophies, and seven Copa del Rey wins, making Barcelona’s most successful era synonymous with his name.On the international front, Messi has also shone brightly, leading Argentina to victory in Copa América twice (2021, 2024), alongside clinching an Olympic gold medal at the Beijing 2008 Games and, most significantly, winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup.After leaving Barcelona in 2021, Messi continued his winning ways at Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), where he added three more titles: two Ligue 1 championships (2021-22, 2022-23) and the Trophée des Champions (2022).However, his triumphant journey didn't end there. In 2023, Messi joined Inter Miami in the US, and within a few short months, he led the club to victory in the Leagues Cup, a landmark achievement for both Messi and Miami.Messi's latest accolade came in October 2024, when he helped secure the MLS Supporters’ Shield after scoring two goals in a thrilling 3-2 victory over Columbus.In the race for most trophies, Messi has overtaken Brazilian legendDani Alves , who boasts 44 titles. Alves, known for his tenacity and versatility as a defender, enjoyed trophy-laden spells with Barcelona, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain, and Sevilla.Despite Alves's impressive collection, Messi’s remarkable consistency and influence in both club and international football have taken him to the top.Other players close to Messi’s record include Egypt’s Hossam Ashour, who won 39 trophies with Al Ahly over a 17-year span, as well as Andres Iniesta and Maxwell, both tied at 37 trophies. Ryan Giggs , the Manchester United icon, rounds out the top five with 36 trophies, making him one of football's most decorated players.Cristiano Ronaldo has 36 trophies in all to his name, making him the seventh contender in the list.With Messi still competing at the highest level, it seems only a matter of time before he adds even more titles to his already unparalleled legacy.","Lionel Messi is the player with the most trophies in football history.

Top 5 unbeatable records in football: Milestones that may never be broken,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/top-5-unbeatable-records-in-football-milestones-that-may-never-be-broken/articleshow/113962712.cms,"L-R: Pele, Real Madrid and Lionel Messi

Here are five of the most remarkable and seemingly unbeatable records in football history:

(2012)

2. 1,279 career goals –

Pele

3. 13 goals in a single

World Cup

–

Just Fontaine

(1958)

4. Five European Cups in a row –

Real Madrid

(1956–1960)

5. Five World Cup wins – Brazil (1958, 1962, 1970, 1994, 2002)

The sport of football has seen many remarkable achievements over the years. However, certain records have transcended time, standing as nearly unbeatable milestones in the game's rich legacy.As modern football evolves with higher levels of competition, tactical innovations, and increased physical demands, some feats appear even more unattainable. From individual brilliance to team dominance, these records have etched their names in football folklore, and they may never be broken.1.Most goals in a calendar year (91 Goals) – Lionel Messi Lionel Messi's incredible feat of scoring 91 goals in 2012 for Barcelona and Argentina is often considered one of the most unbreakable records in football. Messi's sheer consistency and ability to score in almost every match saw him surpass Gerd Müller 's previous record of 85 goals in a calendar year (1972).Brazilian legend Pele is officially recognized by FIFA as having scored 1,279 goals in 1,363 appearances, including friendlies and unofficial matches. While some dispute the inclusion of certain matches, this massive tally stands as one of the most untouchable personal records.French striker Just Fontaine’s record of 13 goals in a single World Cup is another long-standing feat. Despite being set over six decades ago, no player has come close to challenging this tally in a single tournament. With modern football featuring stronger defenses and tactical innovations, this extraordinary record looks untouchable.Real Madrid’s dominance in the early years of the European Cup (now the UEFA Champions League ), winning five consecutive titles from 1956 to 1960, remains a remarkable achievement. Today winning even two consecutive Champions League titles is a massive accomplishment, making Real Madrid’s record seem unbeatable.Brazil is the only nation to have won the FIFA World Cup five times. With an ever-increasing level of competition and teams from across the world improving, matching or surpassing Brazil's record seems difficult. While teams like Germany and Italy have won four World Cups each, catching Brazil’s tally remains an arduous task.","The sport of football has seen many remarkable achievements over the years.

(Pic credit: Mohun Bagan)

KOLKATA: The question came with a certain degree of obviousness and inevitability and Jose Molina couldn't help but play ball during his pre-match news conference at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday.""Are you under more pressure especially after the departure of Carles Cuadrat as East Bengal coach?"" Molina listened to the question intently, sought help from the team’s media manager seated beside him to get the drift behind such a poser and then flashed a smile.""It's not a worry,"" he paused, still smiling. ""The only thing I'm worried about now is tomorrow's match against Mohammedan Sporting. We'll try to play a good match and win. If something has to happen (to me), it will happen,"" the Spanish coach said, trying to put things in perspective.The contrast with which the two teams are preparing to set up this mini-derby has also heightened the sense of the occasion. The onus is clearly on Molina's Mohun Bagan to deliver the goods after the 0-3 humiliation at the hands of Bengaluru FC a week ago.Both Molina and his Australian striker Jason Cummings have called for patience from the fans. But this is something hard to come by in a trophy-driven club. In fact, the way the disgruntled fans reacted to his team's frustrating stalemate against Tajikistan's FC Ravshan in the AFC Champions League Two opener here with 'go-back Molina' chants couldn't have escaped the coach. Another setback and call for Molina's removal will be more pronounced from the stands.Seen from this perspective, Mohammedan Sporting are appearing in the horizon of Molina's Bagan posing an intriguing test to their hosts.By defeating Chennaiyin FC in their own den in the last game, Andrey Chernyshov 's debutants have proved that the so-called elite teams of the new league may take them lightly at their own peril.For Mohammedan Sporting's Russian coach, though, it's all about gaining experience and using them match by match to grow as a unit.""The ISL is a whole new experience for the team. We gained experience from the way we lost to NorthEast United (to a stoppage-time goal) and used to gain a point against FC Goa. Now that we have beaten Chennaiyin, the boys know that we can win also and we'll certainly use this experience in the match against Mohun Bagan,"" said Chernyshov, who guided Mohammedan SC to win the I-League last season and gain promotion to the ISL.Newly recruited French defender Florent Ogier, who landed in the city on the eve of the match, will have to watch it from the stands, but Chernyshov has everyone available for selection.The Russian coach, however, is expecting to face an opponent more hungry and determined to prove a point. The fact that they have lost a match will make them more dangerous coming into this game. There will be pressure on them from the fans and the management. They will be eager to come back stronger. We need to be ready for them,"" Chernyshov said.Aware of the threat from Mohammedan SC's youthful exuberance, Molina also reminded everyone that it won't be an easy match.As Cummings pointed out: ""This season is going to be tougher. We need to be patient. Goals will come, clean sheets will come and wins will come. We need to be at our best every week.""Manvir Singh and Sahal Abdul Samad are injured and doubtful starters but Ashique Kuruniyan may come back to action after a year.",Mohun Bagan take on Mohammedan Sporting in ISL opener on Saturday.

MARGAO: During the pre-match media interaction, FC Goa coach Manolo Marquez spoke fondly of Borja Herrera ’s left foot. The praise came after the hat-trick against East Bengal for Goa’s first win in the Indian Super League ( ISL ) this season.On Friday, Borja’s left foot came to Manolo’s rescue again as the hosts secured a last-gasp equaliser against NorthEast United FC for a 3-3 draw at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda.The end may have been entertaining for the hosts after Borja struck in the fourth minute of added time.They almost secured a win, forcing NorthEast goalkeeper Gurmeet into two good saves deep into stoppage time. But after a cold shower, there would be a reality check as Goa have remained winless in two home games, surrendering the lead in successive games at home. It all started with Nestor Albiach handing NorthEast the lead in the sixth minute. Armando Sadiku then scored in the first half and added time and again just two minutes after the restart to swing the momentum in Goa’s favour.The visitors, though, were not to be left behind as Nestor scored his second and Alaeddine Ajaraie added another one to make it 3-2 with two goals in the 51st and 56th minutes. There was still plenty of time left on the clock. Goa pressed, tried, and only succeeded in the fourth minute of stoppage time with Borja scoring the equaliser with his appreciable left foot.The draw left Goa with just a win from four matches before the international break. “We are not happy despite equalising in the last minute,” Manolo said after the game.","FC Goa draw 3-3 with NorthEast United FC in Indian Super League (ISL) Goa have remained winless in two home games, surrendering the lead in successive games at home.

But they have a chance now to get back to winning ways as they host East Bengal at JRD Tata Sports Complex in Jamshedpur on Saturday.The Kolkata giants have once again made a terrible start to the league having lost all their three opening games and are placed bottom of the table with no point. To make matters worse, their coach Carles Cuadrat resigned earlier this week and Bino George has been brought in as the interim coach.It will naturally be a big challenge for George, who, despite the current situation, sounded quite confident. ""We have a good team and we will stick to our plan. In the last three games we played well but lost because we made small mistakes. So we worked on those mistakes in our training session and I believe the boys will take the responsibility so that we have a good game here,"" said George during the press conference on Friday.Red and Gold captain Cleiton Silva, too, acknowledged the difficulty of the situation but is hopeful of a positive result which he believes will turn everything around.It's not going to be easy though.Playing against Jamshedpur at the Furnace is not an easy task especially when it's packed to the brim which is expected to be the case on Saturday evening. And Khalid Jamil, who had coached East Bengal in the I-League earlier, will be eager to get the better of his previous team and three crucial points.For now his primary focus is on making a good start which hasn't been the case in the last three games. Against all their three opponents — Goa, Mumbai and Odisha — Jamshedpur conceded early and then made a comeback.While they were able to win it on the first two occasions, they fell short against Odisha FC. ""We weren't up to the mark in the last match. But this is a different game and we have to bounce back and get a positive result,"" said Khalid.For that to be realised, a lot will depend on whether the team is able to make the moves down the wings with Imran Khan leading the charge on the right and Seiminlen Doungel or Mohammed Sanan on the left. As far as scoring goals is concerned, the trio of Jordan Murray, Javi Hernandez and Javier Siverio will again be in focus. Most importantly, their defence will have to do a better job along with goalkeeper Albino Gomes if the hosts are to grab some points.But whatever the result, an interesting thing about the fixture is that it will be the first time this season that the two teams facing off will be coached by Indians.

All the buzz through the week had been around her 15-year-old rival, Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi , but it made little difference to Vaidehi Chaudhari .The 24-year-old from Gujarat, who hadn’t dropped a set the whole week, maintained the clean slate by taming Maaya 6-3, 6-3 to reclaim the women’s singles title at the Fenesta Open National tennis championship in New Delhi on Saturday.“It was a really good match. I was playing a young girl. I had pressure as I was the top seed here, and had won the title before also. She (Maaya) had nothing to lose,” said Vaidehi, referring to her success in the tournament in 2022.She had also been runner-up to Shrivalli Rashmikaa last year, making it “three finals in a row”.Tamil Nadu’s 17-year-old Rethin Pranav claimed the men’s singles title, overcoming Nitin Kumar Sinha of Railways 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 for his maiden championship.Maharashtra’s Prisha Shinde clinched the Under-18 girls’ trophy, fighting back from 2-5 in the second set to beat Tamil Nadu’s Diya Ramesh 1-6, 7-6 (4), 6-2 in a two-hour long final.Aradhya Kshitij of Karnataka lifted the boys’ title with a 5-7, 7-5, 6-4 win over Manipur’s second seed Shanker Heisnam.The women’s final lasted an hour and 35 minutes, but it could have been even shorter. Vaidehi was up 5-0 in the second set when Maaya fought back to make it 3-5 before the Indian Billie Jean King Cup player nipped the late challenge from her rival.“I started cramping at 5-0. I was sick, was having cold and fever the last three days,” revealed Vaidehi.The title caps a fine run in the past few months for Vaidehi, starting with the $25,000 title in Chinese Taipei in June and followed by a semifinal in Kazakhstan and another final and a semifinal in Thailand.Despite the progress on court, it has been a struggle for Vaidehi to improve her tennis finances.“I was travelling alone in Taipei, and it was really hot out there. I played really well, I beat two players ranked higher than me. I was down 0-6, 0-3 in the second round, but came back strongly. In the final, I was again first set down. It’s the biggest title of my career so far,” she said.“The challenge for me is, being a woman, I cannot travel alone to some places (tournament venues) because they are not safe. If I take sponsorship, then I can have someone to travel with me,” said Vaidehi, who has her own travelling expenses covered by the Gujarat State sports authority.Yet, now that her goal for the year of winning a $25K title is achieved, Vaidehi is looking ahead with positivity.“I have slowly taken one step at a time. Now I am just more confident,” said Vaidehi, who will be travelling to Australia after a 10-day break.“There are a series of five big tournaments. I am looking forward to playing my first $75K event.”",Gujarat's Vaidehi Chaudhari won the women's singles title at the Fenesta Open National tennis championship in New Delhi on Saturday.

SHANGHAI: Novak Djokovic said it took time to ""get the rust off"" as he fought through two tiebreaks to make his way into the third round of the Shanghai Masters on Saturday.The Serbian beat American Alex Michelsen in a thrilling two-set match that finished 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (11/9).Meanwhile Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz showed why they were top in the world as they raced through to the next stage with confident straight-set wins.Sinner dispatched Japan's Taro Daniel 6-1, 6-4, while Alcaraz made short work of China's Shang Juncheng, winning 6-2, 6-2.Four-time Shanghai champion Djokovic did not have it quite so easy against 43rd ranked Michelsen.Introduced as the ""Greatest Of All Time"" as he walked onto the court, he received a rapturous welcome from the packed stadium.But Michelsen started the first set strongly, breaking Djokovic early and going 1-4 up -- to the displeasure of the crowd, fully behind the 37-year-old former world number one.To their delight, the Serbian levelled, and then hit his stride in the tiebreak, winning it 7-3.The reverse happened in the second set when it was 20-year-old Michelsen's turn to catch up to take it to the tiebreak.Djokovic admitted to being ""surprised"" by Michelsen.""It took me a little bit of time to get the rust off and to start feeling better on the court,"" he said.""I was very glad to keep calm when it mattered in both tiebreaks.""The crowd, already in a frenzy after Djokovic spoke Mandarin at the end of the match, went wild as he showed off a new trick -- attempting a sentence in the Shanghainese vernacular.World number one Sinner has said he is not in a ""comfortable"" situation thanks to a World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) appeal against a decision by tennis authorities to clear him of wrongdoing after he twice tested positive for a steroid in March.His recent blistering winning streak was broken by Alcaraz in the China Open final on Wednesday.But there was no tiredness on display from either player on Saturday, with 23-year-old Sinner looking completely unruffled in the first set against the 93rd-ranked Daniel.Daniel fell behind again in the second set and despite rallying halfway through to gently test Sinner, the Italian kept his cool, ending the set 6-4.Sinner will face Argentina's Tomas Martin Etcheverry on Sunday.""It will be a tough one tomorrow, very physical, because me and Tomas know each other quite well now,"" he said.Earlier, arch-rival Alcaraz also looked comfortable throughout, breaking in the first game, with teenager Shang unable to make much headway against the world number two.Despite their enthusiasm for Shang, the crowd could not resist Alcaraz's charm.At the Spaniard's encouragement, they broke into loud cheers when he won a particularly exciting rally in which he hit a tricky backwards shot to keep the point alive.""I just had one practice then was straight into this match, so to be able to show this level in the first match, I'm just really proud,"" 21-year-old Alcaraz said after the match.He will next face another Chinese player, wildcard Wu Yibing.There were no surprises either for the tournament's second seed Alexander Zverev , who won 6-4, 6-2 against Italy's Mattia Bellucci.""Everything is ok when you win... I was very uncertain of my level before this tournament started,"" the German said, referencing recent health problems that saw him miss the China Open.The tournament lost its second top-ten player on Saturday, as Andrey Rublev fell to 19-year-old Czech Jakub Mensik .The Russian, a finalist at last year's Shanghai Masters, roared in jubilation after winning a tiebreaker to take the first set.But 65th-ranked Mensik broke Rublev in the first game of the second set, and again in the fifth to draw even.The Czech then came from behind in the third to beat the world number six for the second time this year, with a final score of 6-7 (7/9), 6-4, 6-3.",Novak Djokovic into third round of Shanghai Masters.
