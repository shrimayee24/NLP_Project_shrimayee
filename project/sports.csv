IndiGo Crisis: Inside Pilot Shortage, Rule Change and Winter Delays Behind Over 200 Cancellations

Ten hours on plastic chairs, midnight boarding, pre-match heebie-jeebies. Mumbai City FC ’s journey to a Super Cup semi-final became the face of a nationwide air travel meltdown as IndiGo cancellations and delays left thousands stranded across India.The former ISL champions reached Goa Thursday morning after their Wednesday afternoon flight was cancelled amid widespread disruption. “After nearly 10 hou-rs at the airport, endless que-ues, and enough chaos to test anyone’s match-day patience, the boys stuck together,” the club posted on social media.They were far from alone. At least 14 IndiGo flights to Goa were cancelled and over 25 delayed. Across Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Guwahati, Lucknow and Bhubaneswar, terminals overflowed with stranded passengers, rescheduled departures collapsed without warning and airfares spiked to international levels.“My mother-in-law passed away this morning. We paid Rs 40,000 for two one-way tickets to Trivandrum,” said Gopan Nair, stuck at Mumbai airport’s boarding gate after a four-hour delay. “The funeral was postponed so we could attend, but we’re stuck here.”As cancellations mounted, fares turned punishing. One-way economy tickets from Kolkata to Bengaluru surged to between Rs 21,000 and Rs 1 lakh. Same-day fares from Mumbai to Delhi touched Rs 23,000.Kolkata-Delhi fares rose to Rs 25,000–Rs 84,000. “A UK round trip costs around Rs 80,000. People paid nearly that for a one-way domestic ticket,” said Anjani Dhanuka of Travel Agents Association of India.In Kolkata, MBA student Nishita Chowdhury learned her Mumbai flight was cancelled only after reaching the airport, a day before an exam. Avik Sarkar, flying from Bengaluru to Kolkata for travel to Arunachal Pradesh, had his flight cancelled mid-evening. “The rebooking link didn’t work. I had to pay Rs 24,000 for a new ticket. Now I may miss my next connection,” he said.Others arrived — without luggage. Rakesh Rastogi landed in Kolkata after a 14-hour delay only to find his bags still in Delhi. “We came for a wedding. We arrived without our clothes,” he said. CISF reinforcements were called in as tensions rose at the terminal.At Pune airport, 19 delayed and 11 grounded aircraft occupied most parking bays. Some passengers were trapped inside planes for up to five hours after landing. “The captain said even ATC had no clue when we would deboard,” said Megh Gandhi.In Lucknow, passengers shouted slogans against IndiGo. “No updates, no communication, no responsibility,” posted Dhruv Choudhary. Travel agent Sarvesh Pandey discovered his rescheduled flight had departed without notification, costing him two days and a family function.At Chennai airport, there was similar chaos. “People are sitting on the floor. There’s no proper communication,” said advocate Brahma Puthran, whose Kochi-bound flight was pushed back by hours after being cancelled the previous night.In Guwahati, passengers bound for Aizawl said they were told no flights were available for two days. “They promised refunds but no food or hotels,” one traveller said. Some tried humour to cope. “Getting a flight to Mumbai this weekend is like finding a last-minute Coldplay ticket,” one passenger posted.","Mumbai City FC's journey to a Super Cup semi-final became the face of a nationwide air travel meltdown.

NEW DELHI: Outside Delhi airport 's departure terminal, a young couple with a toddler - their child fast asleep on the mother's lap - sat glued to their phones as the father repeatedly tried reaching IndiGo's customer care helpline after yet another cancellation. Their flight to Mizoram had been cancelled for the second day in a row on Thursday, they said, and the only alternative being offered was a rebooking costing nearly Rs 50,000 - without any assurance that the family would get seats on the same flight.""We came yesterday as well and returned after waiting for hours when the flight was cancelled. Today, it's the same story,"" the woman said, adding that they had travelled to Delhi for a family function and were now trying to get back home. ""Our work is getting affected too now.""Pointing to other families waiting alongside them, she said many were in a more difficult position.""Some people have hotels booked, some are tourists. They are stuck because every new option is either full or too expensive,"" she said.While her family could manage because they had relatives in Delhi, others, she said, were being forced to extend stays or switch to connecting flights after direct routes were repeatedly cancelled.A few metres away, another family - travelling with elderly parents - said they had woken up at 6am and travelled from Noida for their 9.45am flight to Patna, after being told to arrive earlier because departure had been advanced by 15 minutes. Upon reaching, they learned the flight had been cancelled. The next available option was a midnight departure - turning a short morning journey into a 14-hour wait.""My wife is 80. We have been here since morning. How should anyone feel in this situation? These are not delays that can be fixed quickly. The backlog has to clear first,"" the elderly passenger said, visibly frustrated.Nearby, a Russian tourist heading to Goa struggled to seek clarity from airline staff, typing into a translator app after multiple reschedules. Summing up her experience through the app, she said: ""Holiday became problem. No one explains.""Across the departure gates on Thursday, families sat on luggage, passengers paced between pillars, and several rested in a temporary waiting area set up outside - unsure whether to return home or wait for a last-minute update. Some, who had already completed web check-in, said they felt ""stuck"" because they could not leave the airport without risking losing their seats.Inside the terminal - as seen from outside glass walls and described by passengers who stepped out - long queues stretched across check-in counters and security belts, with seating areas reportedly full.It wasn't just those waiting to depart - passengers landing in Delhi also said they were stuck at baggage belts for unusually long periods, unable to collect their luggage. One traveller posted a photo of a conveyor belt piled with unattended suitcases and wrote that the situation was ""chaotic and exhausting"".On social media, complaints poured in from passengers at airports across the country. ""Flights getting cancelled one after another... chaos at the gates... zero communication,"" a traveller posted on X. Another wrote: ""Delayed more than eight hours, not offering meals. Pathetic service.""On Wednesday, IndiGo cancelled several flights nationwide, including several from Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. The disruption was attributed to staff shortages linked to the recently implemented rest-period rules under the revised flight duty time limitation norms. The airline said the disruption was caused due to ""unforeseen operational circumstances"", adding measures were being taken to restore schedules.On Thursday, the problem persisted, with 89 departures and 83 arrivals impacted.

PS:

T1, New Delhi: Last evening I was forewarned. “You’re on an IndiGo flight to Bengaluru tomorrow? Their schedule was haywire today. Tomorrow could be chaotic too. Try to change your carrier,” advised a colleague during the evening editorial meeting.I tried. My flight was scheduled to depart at 2.15pm on Thursday. I rushed to see if I could get a ticket on another airline. But a ticket to Bengaluru had become pricier than a seat at a Taylor Swift concert. Clearly, other carriers were indulging in ‘surge pricing.’ I briefly considered cancelling the trip but finally decided to go ahead. “How bad can it get,” I thought. Silly me!Thursday began well. I received a message in the morning from IndiGo saying they were looking forward to having me on board with the usual advice about what to pack in cabin baggage. There wasn’t the slightest hint of any disruption or inconvenience. “Maybe they’ve sorted out their problems overnight. Or my flight is among the few unaffected,” I thought optimistically.I left for the airport around 11am, reached T1 around 12.30pm. My hopes rose further when the information board said IndiGo’s 2.15pm flight to Bengaluru, 6E 176, would go ahead as scheduled. Even the gate number, 38 in this case, was mentioned.I thanked my lucky stars.The first hint that something was wrong came as I neared Gate 38 and found a crowd gathered around a single person, their voices sharp with anger. But by the time I reached the spot, the crowd had dispersed. “What’s happening?” I asked. One of the passengers enlightened me. “We’re supposed to be on a 10.30am flight to Bengaluru, 6E 173. But the flight time has long since passed and there’s no information. We spotted an IndiGo staffer and tried asking him but he’s completely clueless. ”With a sinking feeling, I checked the information board. It still said that my flight was on schedule. I settled down with a history book, still hopeful but a lot less optimistic.Around 1.30pm, there was a flurry of movement. A gentleman from IndiGo had arrived on the scene, and a crowd formed around him. “Where is the plane?” demanded one person. “The plane is ready, but we don’t have a pilot to fly it,” he responded. “When will you have a pilot? Is the flight delayed or cancelled?” asked the passengers. He had no answers.As he walked away, some angry flyers to another destination, who had been waiting even longer, stood near the gate and began chanting their flight number. “434, 434!” Briefly, a rumour spread that another IndiGo flight was ready for departure. Some ‘434’ flyers began yelling that they wouldn’t allow the flight to take off till their flight left. It turned out that it was another carrier’s flight, not IndiGo’s. The angry passengers watched sullenly as the lucky flyers filed through the gate, some offering sympathetic smiles.By now, it was 1.45pm. If my plane was to take off on time, boarding would have to start now. The information board was still saying the flight would take off at 2.15pm. But there was no boarding announcement. I sighed and headed off for a loo break.When I returned, passengers were filing through Gate 38. I rushed to join the queue, which was quite long. After a few minutes, raised voices were heard again. It turned out that this was a long-delayed flight to Chennai finally taking off.By now my phone was running low on juice, so I plugged in the charger and sat down. A newly-wed couple was sitting next to me and we got talking. “We’ve been here since 10.30am,” said the husband. “They checked in our luggage and never said a word about the delay. Now even if we want to cancel, we can’t. We’re helpless and stuck.” (He requested me not to publish his name, saying he’s in the Army and not allowed to speak to the media without authorisation).Around 3pm, there was another flurry of movement. “Don’t you dare touch me,” yelled a furious IndiGo lady staffer at an irate passenger. Tempers were running high. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed. The passenger apologised and the lady calmed down. “So when is 6E 173 taking off?” asked a passenger. “It’s now scheduled for 5pm,” she said. “What about 6E 176?” asked others. “That will now leave at 6.30pm,” she said.I sighed and settled back with my book. After half an hour, I again glanced at the information board. It now said my flight would depart at 7.10pm. But after some time, the timing changed again to 8.20pm. And the boarding gate shifted to 42. Rumours began circulating. “The flight will leave at midnight”. “The flight will be cancelled.”I called our aviation correspondent. “Can you ask them for a definite time of departure?” I asked. “I can, but I doubt if even they know for sure,” he replied.I thought of all the hours wasted. I thought of having to do it all over again, on the return flight. And I finally caved in and did what I should have done 24 hours earlier.I cancelled my flight.If I thought my ordeal was over, I was mistaken. As I tried to exit the airport, I found a long queue at the security check point. It was for all flyers whose flights had been cancelled, or had chosen to cancel their tickets.‘Tech-unsavvy people’ who had hard copies of their boarding cards simply got them stamped and breezed through. ‘Digital natives’ who had PDFs or had availed of DigIYatra had to show their cards and ID to an IndiGo staffer, who diligently noted their details.I fumed and fretted for an hour, vowing that next time I’d take a hard copy. Still, I was one of the lucky ones, because I had packed all my stuff in a laptop bag and hadn’t checked in any luggage. Those who had checked in their luggage had no idea how to retrieve it. “We’ll probably have to come back tomorrow,” I heard an elderly gentleman tell his wife.A couple of young women who had missed their connecting flight wondered what had happened to their luggage. Was it still in IGI or had it gone to the next destination? They’d probably have to come back the next day to find out too.Just as I reached the IndiGo staffer, he began walking away. Passengers standing behind me howled in protest.“Where are you going? We’ll have a riot,” a CISF lady standing next to him said sharply.He looked like he was about to burst into tears. “I haven’t eaten or drunk anything since 2pm. Can I please get some water at least?” he pleaded.“Get someone to replace you first,” the lady replied curtly.The man sighed, wiped his face and turned towards me. I felt a pang of sympathy for him. I wished that I had a bottle of water to offer him. But all I could do was quietly proffer my phone, for him to note my details.","The IndiGo crisis has led to over 200 flight cancellations and delays. The airline is facing a pilot shortage, rule change and winter delays. An editorial team from CNN-IBN tried to get a ticket on another airline.

Country’s first blind Army officer in active service shoots to national award,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/countrys-first-blind-army-officer-in-active-service-shoots-to-national-award/articleshow/125755670.cms,"President Droupadi Murmu presents Lt Col C Dwarakesh with the National Award for Persons with Disabilities on Wednesday





PUNE: A basketball match at a military station in 2014 was one of the last things Lt Col C Dwarakesh saw before an accident left him blind. He would spend the next eight months in hospital, healing and adjusting to life without eyesight while his mind envisioned new possibilities.On Wednesday, President Droupadi Murmu presented the 36-year-old with the National Award for Persons with Disabilities, recognising an Army career that even disability couldn’t cut short, and one that now includes a world record in para shooting.Lt Col Dwarakesh is the first officer of the Indian armed forces to continue in active service despite total blindness. It’s an achievement made possible by the derring-do of a young officer who never gave up on himself despite no precedent.“As an Army officer, I was trained to have conviction, courage, willpower and tenacity. But blindness is an impediment I couldn’t have prepared for,” Lt Col Dwarakesh told TOI from Delhi. “I overcame this hurdle through academics and technology, clearing multiple competitive exams along the way. I now research para sports, especially for people living with blindness. I converted my disability into a power and found ways to express the way those with vision do.This mindset has helped me reach new heights.”Supported by AI tools and assistive technology, Dwarakesh performs his responsibilities with the same proficiency and precision as his colleagues. In paralympic sports, he is a national champion in swimming and shooting, ranked world No. 3 in the 10m air rifle event. His most recent achievement was a world record score of 624.6 at the Shooting World Cup in the UAE this Oct. As part of the Indian para shooting team, he trains at Army Marksmanship Unit in Mahou.Dwarakesh, who joined the Army in 2009, terms the national award a “full-circle moment”. “I remember being granted commission by the President,” he said. “And to be receiving an award from the President 16 years later for something that redefined me, that’s quite something.”The officer, a native of TN, has also qualified for the UGC NET, making him one of the few visually impaired academicians in management, human resources, labour law, and sports research.","Lt Col C Dwarakesh is the first officer of the Indian armed forces to continue in active service despite total blindness.

What a Reunion Would Mean for the Warriors

Themay be eyeing a reunion that would a fan-favorite veteran ahead of the trade deadline. With the franchise looking to sharpen its three-point firepower for the rest of the season, recent speculation suggests the team could target a familiar face: Dallas Mavericks guard Klay Thompson, a four-time NBA champion currently on a $50 million deal.The discussion gained traction after Blue Man Hoop’s Nick San Miguel suggested that Dallas, now in organizational transition, could move on from some of its higher-priced veterans. As Miguel wrote, “With the Mavericks in a state of flux after firing general manager Nico Harrison, it would not be surprising if they traded away some of their pricier players like (Klay) Thompson or Anthony Davis.”Golden State’s intentions have been clear from the moment they signed Seth Curry on Monday. A franchise built on outside shooting needs more consistency from deep, and Curry’s arrival already looks promising.In his first game with the Warriors, the 35-year-old guard delivered 14 points while shooting an impressive 85.7 percent from the field and 66.7 percent from three against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Still, the front office appears to be exploring additional depth options.The Golden State Warriors have rotated through several shooting guards this season, hoping someone would seize the role.Here’s how the current situation stands:Nick San Miguel emphasized this instability, noting, “Golden State has cycled through the shooting guard position this season.” That context opens the door to the possibility of bringing back Thompson, a move that would be both sentimental and strategic. (H/t: Sporting News)Dallas Mavericks’ front office changes have created uncertainty around the roster. Klay Thompson, now 6-foot-5 and 21 games into the season, has delivered a mix of high-ceiling performances and off nights that have raised questions about his consistency.His performances have ranged widely, with games where he “set the nets on fire” and others where he “looked washed-up in every aspect of the game.” That unpredictability makes him a gamble=, but one the Warriors may feel is worthwhile.Bringing Klay Thompson back would tap into a decade of history. The Golden State Warriors’ four championships with Stephen Curry all came with Thompson by his side. While his current form is less reliable, the franchise might view the reunion as a chance to recapture some of that magic as Curry’s career winds down.• Familiarity with Steve Kerr’s system• Deep playoff experience• Ability to stretch the floor• Potential second-unit scoring sparkEven with concerns about consistency, Thompson’s long-range resume remains elite. If he can rediscover rhythm in a familiar environment, he could become a valuable contributor for a team still chasing another title in the Curry era.If Golden State does pursue a trade, expectations would need to be tempered. Thompson is no longer the 20-point scorer he once was, but his shooting gravity and veteran presence could elevate a second unit that has lacked stability.The move would also carry emotional weight. For fans, players, and even the organization, welcoming Thompson back would feel like closing a circle—one more run with a core that defined an era of NBA basketball.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to land $186 million Milwaukee Bucks superstar to form Big 3 with LeBron James and Luka Doncic As of now, it remains speculation, but the idea is no longer far-fetched. The Warriors want shooting, the Mavericks may be recalibrating, and Thompson sits right at the intersection of both storylines. Whether nostalgia or strategy ultimately drives the decision, Golden State could find itself revisiting one of the most iconic partnerships in franchise history.",The Golden State Warriors have rotated through several shooting guards this season.

Who is Gemmi Schottenheimer?





How Gemmi Schottenheimer supported Brian through NFL challenges





More coverage on NFL:

In the high-stakes world of the NFL, where coaches are constantly under pressure to deliver results, few pause to notice the steady forces that keep them grounded. For Dallas Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer, that unwavering force is his wife, Gemmi Schottenheimer. Her life may unfold away from the sidelines and flashing cameras, but her presence has shaped Brian’s career and family in ways only those closest to them can truly understand. Behind every play call and every move across teams, Gemmi has been the quiet constant—strong, patient, and deeply supportive.Gemmi Schottenheimer has lived through the highs and lows of the NFL lifestyle. From team changes to unexpected firings, she has been Brian’s anchor in an unpredictable profession. Before their marriage, fate brought her close to his family in a rather unusual way. While working for the Washington Redskins, Gemmi crossed paths with legendary coach Marty Schottenheimer, who happened to be Brian’s father. She recalled in a 2024 podcast with Stacey Bell, “I had not met Brian at that point. I sort of became an assistant to him [Marty] while he was trying to find one. I was on his voicemail. I did all these things and just sort of had an opportunity to watch him lead without being in the family or dating Brian.”Ironically, when she finally met Brian, she didn’t even realize who his father was. “When I met Brian, didn’t even know that he was Marty’s son in the beginning… So it was just kind of unique for me to transition into a daughter-in-law,” Gemmi said. Over the years, their relationship only grew stronger, especially during the toughest times — like when Marty was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2016. Through those painful moments, Gemmi held the family together, showing the same calm strength that defines her today.Life with an NFL coach demands patience and adaptability. For Gemmi, that meant managing home life, raising two children, and maintaining a sense of stability while Brian juggled long hours and constant team transitions. Her resilience shone through even during career shocks. Reflecting on tough times, she said, “The Seattle firing, you know, was definitely something we didn’t see coming. We had just won the division. And as you know, I mean, Marty was fired after a 14 and two season. So these firings, it can happen when you least expect it.”Beyond the sidelines, Gemmi’s support also extended to moments of celebration. When Brian was named Cowboys head coach in 2025, Gemmi learned the news directly from Jerry and Stephen Jones. “I got out of [Brian’s] truck and started saying, ‘Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!’ I didn’t have anyone to talk to. I was by myself, but it was really special,” she recalled.Gemmi Schottenheimer may not wear a headset on game day, but she’s every bit a part of Brian’s success. Her quiet strength and enduring love have shaped his journey. Together, the Schottenheimers have shown that true partnership — built on trust, loyalty, and resilience — is the real foundation of greatness.","Gemmi Schottenheimer has lived through the highs and lows of the NFL lifestyle.

Charlie Kirk Killing Firestorm: Owens Goes To War With TPUSA; Live Showdown Confirmed

TPUSA sets the livestream time, and Candace Owens gets upset

Candace Owens says the time clashes with her own show





Is Candace Owens backing out on TPUSA livestream?





Candace Owens and Turning Point USA (TPUSA) are fighting again, and this time it is over a meeting time that she says she never agreed to. On Thursday, Candace Owens said TPUSA set a livestream time about her remarks on Charlie Kirk ’s death without asking her first. She shared her anger on X and said she was surprised to learn about the plan only through a tweet.This whole issue started after Charlie Kirk was killed on September 10 at Utah Valley University. Since then, Candace Owens has shared many ideas and claims about what happened, even saying TPUSA leaders “betrayed” Charlie Kirk. She has not shared proof for these claims.Because her comments got a lot of attention, TPUSA’s Tyler Neff invited her to The Charlie Kirk Show to clear the air. At first, Candace Owens said yes. But when the date and time were posted without her input, things got heated again.Tyler Neff posted on X that the livestream would take place on Monday, December 15, at 4 pm Eastern. He said the stream would happen live from Charlie Kirk’s studio in Phoenix. He also said Candace Owens could join them in person if she wanted, and she should tell them by the end of the day.But Candace Owens said no one asked her about her schedule. She said she found the post “weird” because TPUSA did not email or call her before setting the time.She said she only learned about it on X, and that made her upset.Candace Owens said the time chosen by TPUSA was the same time she does her own daily live podcast. She said TPUSA knew this already. Still, she tried to keep things open and said she could cancel her show for that day and join the livestream virtually instead of going to Phoenix.She asked TPUSA if that option worked for them and said, “Let’s lock it in?”Right now, she is not backing out. Candace Owens still wants to join the livestream, but not in person, and not at the time TPUSA picked without asking her.Many people on X supported her and said TPUSA should have checked with her first, especially because they were the ones who invited her.Also Read: Candace Owens Sparks Huge Online Fury After Sharing Private Charlie Kirk Stories That Upset Widow Erika Kirk","Candace Owens and Turning Point USA (TPUSA) are fighting again, and this time it is over a meeting time that she says she never agreed to.

He was out fishing.” She added that their family is still processing the loss, noting, “He was such a big pillar and a staple to our family.He’s going to be terribly missed.”His family released a statement remembering Campbell as “a man to whom family meant everything — generous, funny, disciplined and kind, but could shut you down if required.” They emphasized his faith and said, “He passed doing what he loved: fishing out on the ocean, enjoying his idea of an ideal day.”Campbell is survived by his wife, Rosemary, their children Jay Lee, Jael, Ariel and Aaron, his sister, and his brothers Elwayne and Charles Jr.Tributes poured in from across the league as news spread.

Kobe Bryant childhood friend claims NBA star didn’t help family or friends

An alleged childhood friend of the late NBA legend has said that Kobe “wasn’t a good person” and “didn’t help his own family and friends.” While these allegations are gaining attention online, it’s important to look at the full picture. Kobe was a complex individual; fiercely driven, sometimes distant, but also known for acts of generosity and mentorship throughout his life.According to the report, the alleged friend says he asked Kobe for help during a difficult period, hoping for support or opportunities. The friend claims Kobe promised to assist but never followed through, leaving him disappointed.

Who Wins the Deal?

' front office is quietly positioning itself for a move that could reshape the late innings of the 2026 season. According to widespread reporting, including coverage from Sporting News and Seattle-based outlets, the Mariners are showing serious interest in Philadelphia Phillies left-hander Matt Strahm, one of the league’s steadiest high-leverage arms. As original writer Caleb Hightower noted, the Mariners are circling a move that would be received as a major statement around the league: “The Golden State Warriors have a chance to make a move that would stun the NBA world.” While referencing a different sport, the sentiment from Hightower reflects the magnitude insiders are attaching to a potential Strahm deal for Seattle.The Seattle Mariners, who finished 2025 with a top-10 bullpen ERA but limited left-handed depth, appear focused on Matt Strahm over other Phillies southpaws such as José Alvarado and Tanner Banks. With the Winter Meetings underway, league chatter suggests Seattle wants to solidify the final innings next to Gabe Speier, especially after falling one win shy of the 2025 World Series.No formal offer has been submitted, but analysts agree that the cleanest path involves a one-for-one swap: Matt Strahm goes to Seattle, while the Philadelphia Phillies receive top catching prospect Harry Ford.Strahm, owed $7.5 million in 2026, is entering his final year of club control.Ford, ranked No. 4 in Seattle’s system and No. 40 overall by MLB Pipeline, has long been considered one of the organization’s most dynamic young players. He hit .283 with 16 homers and an .868 OPS at Triple-A Tacoma before his late-season promotion in 2025. With Cal Raleigh entrenched as Seattle’s everyday catcher and coming off an AL MVP runner-up campaign, Ford’s long-term path is blocked.Philadelphia Phillies' interest makes sense. Ford’s 35 steals in 2024 minors showcase a rare speed-power profile for a catcher, and the Phillies are facing looming outfield needs, payroll adjustments, and succession planning behind J.T. Realmuto.Matt Strahm has quietly become one of MLB’s most reliable late-inning relievers. His .499 OPS allowed in high-leverage scenarios during 2025 underscores why Seattle Marinewrs view him as a playoff weapon. His ability to miss bats, paired with a 93rd-percentile chase rate, fits perfectly into a bullpen that ranked ninth overall but lacked left-handed strikeout juice.Seattle’s bullpen posted a collective 3.72 ERA in 2025, but with only Speier providing consistent left-handed production, the need for another late-inning southpaw grew increasingly obvious as October approached.• Immediate upgrade in high-leverage innings• A proven postseason arm with strong command• No long-term salary burden• Strahm’s profile matches T-Mobile Park’s pitcher-friendly environment• Helps address a bullpen that converted just 62.3 percent of save opportunitiesSeattle Marainers are also in an aggressive stage of its competitive cycle. Coming off a near-pennant run, the front office is attempting to maximize its window without sacrificing core pieces.• Harry Ford offers controllable years and fills both catching and outfield depth concerns• Phillies save $7.5 million for 2026, preserving flexibility for outfield or right-handed relief upgrades• Ford’s speed-power potential could address a lineup that needs athleticism and long-term planning• Allows Philadelphia to move a reliever before free agency rather than risk losing him for nothing• Strahm enhances the bullpen instantly with strikeouts and late-inning poise• Complements Seattle’s dominant starting rotation• Avoids long-term payroll commitments while keeping the roster competitive• Acquire an MLB-ready prospect with valuable versatility• Maintain roster balance amid impending outfield uncertainties• Add future cost-controlled production• Trading Ford thins catching depth behind Cal Raleigh• Strahm is 34, limiting multi-year upside• Reliever performance is naturally volatile• Losing Strahm removes their most reliable left-handed reliever• Ford’s defense still lags behind his bat and athletic toolsFrom a pure impact standpoint, the Seattle Mariners come out ahead in the short term. Their push to capitalize on a championship window makes Strahm’s role clear and immediate. His high-leverage steadiness, postseason readiness, and ability to neutralize AL West lefty-righty sluggers offer value that far outweighs the risk.Philadelphia, meanwhile, benefits from adding a high-end prospect without absorbing financial strain, but the loss of Strahm undeniably weakens their bullpen until internal arms or external signings fill the gap.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Chicago Cubs refocus on $80 million Boston Red Sox superstar to compensate for Kyle Tucker departure Both sides satisfy key organizational needs, but Seattle’s immediate return gives them the edge.","Matt Strahm has quietly become one of MLB’s most reliable late-inning relievers.

NEW DELHI: Out-of-favour India pacer Mohammed Shami delivered another strong performance in domestic cricket, taking 4 for 13 to help Bengal beat Services by seven wickets in a Group C match of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy in Hyderabad on Thursday.This was Bengal’s fourth win in five matches in the tournament. The team, led by Abhimanyu Easwaran, moved to the top of the points table with 16 points and is in a good position to reach the knockouts.Easwaran, who is also trying to strengthen his case ahead of the IPL auction, scored 58 off 37 balls. Bengal chased 166 in 15.1 overs. Abhishek Porel, representing Delhi Capitals in the IPL, scored 56 off 29 balls. The pair added 93 runs for the second wicket in 8.2 overs, which set up the chase.The platform was created by Shami, who was named Player of the Match for his figures of 4/13 in 3.2 overs, and India pacer Akash Deep, who took 3/27. Services were bowled out for 165 in 18.2 overs.Shami picked two wickets in his first spell, dismissing openers Gaurav Kocchar (0) and Ravi Chauhan (26 off 9). Mukesh Kumar, on his return, gave away 53 runs in three overs. Writtick Chatterjee (2/32) and Akash Deep removed key middle-order batters before Shami ended the innings by taking the final wickets.Shami’s strong domestic performance comes when India’s pace-bowling options for the South Africa series are being discussed. Prasidh Krishna conceded 85 runs in the second ODI, even though he took two wickets, which led to debate about Shami’s absence. Harbhajan Singh also questioned the decision.""Where is Shami? I don't know why Shami is not playing. I get it, you have Prasidh, he is a good bowler, but he still has a lot to learn. You had good bowlers, and you have slowly sidelined them. With Bumrah, this is a different bowling attack, and without Bumrah, it is entirely different attack altogether.

A decade-long wait ends

BRISBANE: Joe Root finally broke his long-awaited century jinx in Australia on Thursday, but the loudest sigh of relief didn’t come from England’s dressing room — it came from Matthew Hayden’s house. And more specifically, from his daughter, Grace.Root’s fluent 135 on Day 1 of the pink-ball Ashes Test at the Gabba not only ended 10 years of Australian heartbreak but also saved Hayden from fulfilling a bizarre promise. The former Australia opener had jokingly vowed to “walk naked around the MCG” if Root failed to score a hundred this series.The moment Root reached three figures off Scott Boland, social media exploded — and Hayden’s daughter stole the spotlight with a cheeky Instagram story. Posting a selfie, Grace wrote: “Root, thank you, you’ve saved all our eyes.” The hilarious post instantly went viral, turning Root’s milestone into an internet spectacle.Hayden himself quickly posted a congratulatory video shared by England Cricket on X, laughing at his own wager while praising Root’s perseverance.""Congratulations mate on a hundred here in Australia. Took you a while and there was no one that had more skin in the game than me, literally.I was backing you for a hundred in a good way. So congratulations, ten fifties and finally a hundred. You little ripper mate. Have a beauty and bloody enjoy it,"" Hayden joked.Root’s ton was his first in Australia after 16 matches, 30 innings, and four Ashes tours. He brought calm to a tense English innings and climbed to 40 Test hundreds — just one behind Ricky Ponting (41) and trailing only Sachin Tendulkar (51) and Jacques Kallis (45).At stumps, England were 325/9, with Root unbeaten on 135 and Jofra Archer on 32.While Australia dropped regular captain Pat Cummins again and shockingly benched Nathan Lyon for Michael Neser, it was Root’s history-making innings — and Grace Hayden’s viral punchline — that ruled the day.For Root, it was a career milestone. For the Hayden household? It was a national emergency narrowly avoided.","England's Joe Root scores his first century in Australia in 10 years.

Evander Kane trade market remains quiet for Vancouver Canucks



The NHL trade season is slowly heating up, but not every veteran name is generating buzz for the right reasons. For the Vancouver Canucks, discussions around roster flexibility have sparked renewed attention on Evander Kane. His name has surfaced more out of uncertainty. More than genuine market demand.As the NHL season moves closer to its midway point and teams begin shaping deadline strategies, Vancouver appears open to moving veteran contracts. However, league insiders suggest Kane’s situation is complicated. Along with factors such as performance, fit, and long-term value. All of these are influencing the lack of momentum around any potential deal.Despite being a recognizable NHL veteran. Evander Kane has drawn minimal interest across the league. Several NHL executives reportedly believe that Kane’s current production does not justify taking on his contract. Especially for contenders prioritizing cap flexibility and consistent five-on-five impact.Through the early portion of the season. Kane’s offensive output has fallen short of expectations. While he continues to bring size and experience.Teams appear cautious about whether those traits outweigh his declining scoring pace. In today’s NHL trade landscape, analytics-driven evaluations often outweigh reputation. And Kane’s numbers have not helped his case.Canucks general manager Patrik Allvin is believed to be exploring multiple roster scenarios as the NHL trade deadline approaches. While other Vancouver players have reportedly drawn inquiries, Kane’s name has not generated the same level of engagement. That puts added pressure on the Canucks’ front office to either wait for market conditions to change or consider alternative solutions.For now, this NHL trade rumor reflects a broader reality: the market is cautious, and Evander Kane’s future with the Vancouver Canucks remains far from settled. As NHL updates continue to roll in, this situation is one to monitor closely.Also Read: NHL Update: Brad Marchand and his family hosts Thanksgiving to comfort teammates missing home","Evander Kane has drawn minimal interest despite being a recognizable NHL veteran.

William Nylander breaks down the reality of Maple Leafs’ changing core



Auston Matthews and William Nylander | Blue Room Presented by Rogers

The Toronto Maple Leafs started this season with a noticeably different feel, and their early performances have only highlighted the shift. For years, the team relied on a familiar core to carry the load, but with major changes and uneven results, the group is still trying to find its balance. The chemistry that once felt automatic now needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, and every game is exposing both the progress and the gaps.William Nylander, one of the team’s most dependable forwards, has now spoken openly about how different things feel inside the room. His comments reflect a team adjusting to a new identity while trying to stay competitive and consistent on the ice. With expectations still high, his honesty adds weight to the growing sense that the Leafs are navigating one of their most important turning points in recent seasons.Nylander didn’t hesitate to acknowledge how much the team has changed. The long-standing “Core Four” of Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner, John Tavares, and William Nylander once represented Toronto’s best hope of pushing toward a championship. But with Marner traded and Tavares easing into a smaller role, that familiar dynamic has shifted. “For a long time it was the four of us,” Nylander said. “So that is a little bit different.The Maple Leafs responded to these changes by reshaping their lineup. Matthew Knies was moved into a permanent top-line role beside Matthews, signaling the team’s trust in his growing impact. Toronto also added fresh faces in Nicolas Roy, Mattias Macelli, and Dakota Joshua — players expected to bring depth, work ethic, and stability across all zones.Even with these additions, the results have been mixed. After 26 games, the Leafs sit at 12-11-3, struggling to build steady momentum. Their offensive talent remains strong, but defensive breakdowns and inconsistent stretches have held them back. With Marner’s creativity no longer in the mix and Tavares taking on less of the load, Matthews and Nylander have carried more responsibility in key moments.Nylander’s honest reflection shows a team in transition, trying to rebuild its chemistry while learning to operate with a new structure. As the season continues, the challenge for Toronto is to establish a new identity that can support its star players and create the kind of balance needed to turn potential into real progress.Also Read: Tyler Seguin injury update: Dallas coach Glen Gulutzan provides key insight on Star center’s ACL setback",William Nylander opens up on Toronto Maple Leafs' changing core.

Why Shedeur Sanders became one of Google’s most searched people in 2025

Okay, so at this point we all need to admit that Shedeur Sanders isn’t just a quarterback, he’s genuinely one of the biggest entertainment figures of the year. And now Google has basically stamped that fact in bold print. When the company dropped its “Year in Search 2025” data, Shedeur showed up as one of the top trending people worldwide. Like… not top trending athlete. Not top trending football player. One of the top trending humans. If you needed proof that Shedeur is the internet’s main character, here you go.When Google revealed its “Trending People” rankings which track the fastest-rising search spikes of the year, Shedeur Sanders pulled up at No. 6 globally. And honestly, that tells you everything about his impact this year. Google searches are basically the world’s scoreboard for curiosity, and his number was skyrocketing every time something happened in Colorado. Whether it was games, drama, luxury Instagram posts, or Coach Prime headlines, Shedeur’s name just kept dominating the timeline.For anyone new to how Google does this list, it’s not about who is the most famous, it’s about whose name exploded in search traffic. And in 2025, Shedeur was exactly that. He didn’t just make the list; he doubled down by becoming Google’s No. 1 trending athlete of the entire year. That’s above every NFL star, every NBA MVP candidate, and every Olympian.A big part of this is the Prime Effect. Colorado football lived in the media cycle nonstop, and every time Coach Prime talked, the internet listened. Shedeur naturally became the center of that attention, the quarterback, the face of the team, the one dropping viral quotes and highlight plays.There wasn’t a single month where Shedeur wasn’t trending for something.A clutch fourth-quarter comeback? Trending.Rocking a luxury watch and custom Rolls Royce? Trending.Sitting courtside next to celebrities? Trending.Posting a random Instagram story? Somehow still trending.He became a true crossover figure, sports fans searched him, casual viewers searched him, even people who didn’t watch college football searched him just to keep up with the culture. NIL deals, fashion style, viral press conferences, Shedeur basically became a content machine.And with every pop-culture moment, Google searches followed.Also read - Odell Beckham Jr. selling cleats amid financial crisis but fans got the wrong pair","Shedeur Sanders was one of Google's most searched people in 2025.

Donna Kelce’s new acting journey in The Gift Exchange



Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce tried his hand at acting earlier this year, and now Donna Kelce is joining the fun with a holiday project of her own. The proud NFL mom revealed that she is starring in a new Christmas-themed collaboration with Google, and the announcement itself felt like something straight from a holiday film. On December 1, she posted a snowy and charming movie-style poster on Instagram, presenting herself in the heart of a festive town square while a couple exchanges gifts in front of her. Donna stood with a gentle smile, wearing a cozy sweater and clasping her hands in the warm glow of a classic seasonal moment.Her caption added a touch of anticipation. “#Google_Partner #sponsored Gather the family for a new holiday (and @google) classic. Trailer kicking off soon.” It was short, spirited and enough to send fans into a cheerful buzz. The poster design also played into that spirit. With rich red and green lettering, the film title The Gift Exchange, and the Google tie-in slogan “Searching for something unforgettable? Just ask Google. ” it delivered the full holiday sentiment many viewers adore.Donna takes on the role of Carole Hall in this project. She appears alongside WWE star Nikki Garcia as Holly Hall and Chicago Fire actor Taylor Kinney as Aiden Winter.In the poster, her character looks like the wise and kind observer, pleased to see a love story unfold before her. While Donna revealed no further specifics about the production, her post did suggest it might be a holiday short film or sponsored cinematic campaign. Either way, fans embraced it, calling for more Donna screen time.This moment marks more than entertainment. It reflects a personal chapter for Donna Kelce. Just recently, she shared on the Not Gonna Lie podcast that she once dreamed of aviation. “I did learn how to be a pilot before I had children,” said Donna on the Not Gonna Lie podcast. “So, I actually went up and flew a plane. I did [enjoy it], but you want to have children, and it was really expensive, so I had to stop.” She chose family life, earned an MBA from Baldwin Wallace University, completed studies at Ohio University, then worked three decades in banking as the “major breadwinner in the family. ”Her appearance in The Gift Exchange is not her first on camera. She also showed up in Hallmark productions like Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story and Christmas on Call, and called her earlier acting experience “so awesome.” Donna is also preparing for the new season of The Traitors, which adds to her growing media presence.

Abundance by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson





Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close. Gates has recommended five books and he believes that all these titles spark curiosity and reflection during the quieter days of the winter season. “Each of these books pulls back the curtain on how something important really works: how people find purpose later in life, how we should think about climate change, how creative industries evolve, how humans communicate,” wrote Gates.In the blog post, Gates has also explained that holidays are the perfect tome to slow down and also catch up on reading. “There’s something about the quieter days around the holidays that makes it easier to sit down with a good book,” he wrote. His list on 2025 book recommendations reflects on his fascination with how the world works and how you can start a great conversation.The book belongs to the fiction genre and its a story of an aging janitor and a wise octopus captive hime with its empathy and storytelling. “Van Pelt's story made me think about the challenge of filling the days after you stop working—and what communities can do to help older people find purpose,” said Gates.The books explains about the climate challenges. The book structures 50 big questions on climate change, nuclear power and renewables. “ I’ve followed Hannah’s work at Our World in Data for years, and her new book is one of the clearest explanations of the climate challenge I’ve read. She’s realistic about the risks but grounded in data that shows real progress,” said Gates.It is a memoir which recounts the Diller’s extraordinary career in Hollywood, media, and technology, blending personal anecdotes with reflections on power, risk-taking, and the evolution of entertainment and digital industries. “He’s spent his life betting on ideas before they were obvious, and the industries he’s transformed show how much those bets can pay off,” said Gates.The book explains about the mysteries of human behaviour and how people communicate. “Although the topic itself is pretty complicated, the book is readable and practical, and it made me see everyday social interactions in a new light,” added Gate.The books offers a glimpse of at why America seems to struggle to build things and what it will take to fix that. The book argues that progress depends not just on good ideas but on the systems that help ideas spread.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close.

NEW DELHI: There is growing concern in Indian sports administration circles that the promising gains made by the country’s women’s hockey team over the years might get lost in the latest players-coach standoff. Head coach Harendra Singh’s exit from the national setup amid allegations of mental harassment, outdated coaching methods and favouritism, has prompted the sports ministry to step in and defuse the crisis.It has directed the Sports Authority of India’s Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) division and senior administrators at the SAI run regional centre in Bengaluru, where both the hockey teams train, to hold discussions with senior and key members of the women’s team. The aim is to understand the reasons behind the uprising against Harendra, assess its fallout, end any groupism and douse the simmering tensions within the team to avoid such ugly episodes in the future.“We want the women’s hockey team to solely focus on their preparations and games, rather than getting involved in such players-coach politics. We have all been there to help them and provide the best of training facilities, funding, exposure trips, international competitions and coaching,” an official told TOI.However, the ministry officials admitted that HI mishandled and misunderstood the entire situation, when the federation should have played a far more proactive role. “His resignation should have been handled in a gracious way. He left after realising there’s no one in the federation to support his coaching ideas. One can’t let the internal politics win,” another official added. The ministry understands that the next year is important for Indian hockey with Asian Games and World Cup lined up.","There is growing concern in Indian sports administration circles that the promising gains made by the country's women's hockey team might get lost in the latest players-coach standoff.

Dak Prescott drives the Cowboys toward a season-defining matchup



The intensity around Dak Prescott has reached a peak as he enters tonight’s showdown in Detroit with the season hanging in the balance. His 2025 numbers place him at the center of one of the biggest games on Thursday Night Football. The Cowboys need a spark to stay alive in the NFC race, and Prescott’s 3,261 passing yards and 25 touchdowns in 12 games give Dallas a real chance. The Lions feel the same pressure with their own playoff hopes slipping. Both teams know this is not just another week. It feels like a postseason game wrapped inside December football.Prescott arrives with the confidence of a quarterback playing his best stretch of the year. Dallas rides his hot hand because the playoff margin is shrinking fast. A win boosts their odds to 31 percent. A loss drops them to only 6 percent. The Lions are not far off, with a defeat leaving them with a ten percent elimination risk at home inside Ford Field.Dak Prescott ranks 1st in QBR at 102.4 this season with 3,261 passing yards through 12 games, and that production sets the tone for Dallas in every phase. His 25 touchdowns and only 8 interceptions show how precise he has been.Over the last three games, he has taken another huge leap with 942 passing yards, 8 touchdowns, and only 2 interceptions while completing 69.3 percent of his throws. The rise has been timely for a team fighting to stay above the playoff line.His performance against Kansas City highlighted how sharp he is right now when he delivered 320 yards and 2 touchdowns in a 31 to 28 win. Games like that explain why his efficiency sits at the highest point of the season. Tonight, that version of Prescott becomes critical because the Lions pass defense ranks 17th in the league, allowing 212.5 yards per game. It is the kind of matchup he has handled well in the past.Dak Prescott said he’s ready to light up the Lions pass defense in Detroit, just like he did in previous matchups. The rookie 17th ranked pass defense gives up 212.5 yards per game through the air. That opens the field for George Pickens and the rest of the receiving group to stretch Detroit’s shaky coverage.Every drive matters in a game with this much at stake. Both teams feel the weight of playoff pressure, but the Cowboys lean on Prescott’s elite 2025 stats to take control of their season.

CHENNAI: After a week of three straight wins, a clean sheet, and 29 goals, the real show begins now for India at the Hockey Men’s Junior World Cup. On Friday night at the Mayor Radhakrishnan Hockey Stadium, the hosts face their sternest test yet — a plucky and disciplined Belgian side in the quarterfinals. Before the tournament began, India’s chief coach, PR Sreejesh, had said that the competition truly starts in the knockouts.He wasn’t exaggerating. The quarters are where India either take a decisive step toward the trophy, or their title dreams end abruptly. In the torrential rains of Chennai and Madurai, the Rohit Yadav-led side poured in goals at will, but those came against weaker opponents. Only in their final league match against Switzerland did the cracks, so far concealed, become hard to miss. Across their three games, India committed elementary errors that they cannot afford against a sharp Belgian attack.A couple of penalty corners against the Swiss were gifted through sloppy interceptions or five-metre violations. The backline, barely tested in the first two outings, suddenly looked vulnerable.Rohit, Amir Ali, and Talem Priyobarta will now have their hands full, along with goalkeepers Prince Deep Singh and Bikramjit Singh, who did well to preserve a clean sheet in the previous match.Up front, Dilraj Singh, India’s top scorer with six goals, Arshdeep Singh and Manmeet Singh have been electric. But against Belgium, they will need quicker turnarounds, sharper passing, and far more discipline inside the circle. Sreejesh didn’t sugarcoat his concerns after the Swiss game, “I think that match was a good wake up call for us. In the quarterfinals, we must be on our toes.”Belgium may have finished second in Pool D behind Spain, but they’ve scored 22 goals. Recent history favours India. The hosts beat Belgium 2-1 in the title contest, when they last won the trophy in 2016 in Lucknow. In 2021, in Bhubaneswar, they got past the Red Lions 1-0 in the last-8 stage.","India face Belgium in the quarterfinals of the Hockey Men's Junior World Cup.

BENGALURU: The Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) is back in focus for the wrong reasons ,with a group of para athletes writing to the Union sports ministry that the 62 officials cleared for the Asian Youth Para Games, to be held in Dubai from Dec 7-14, includes several persons who made the list using their influence with top PCI officials.“It is deeply disappointing that the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) continues to misuse its authority by appointing individuals who neither possess the required qualifications nor have any credible association with para sports. Such decisions under mine transparency, fairness, and the confidence of genuine athletes and stakeholders,” Clean Para Sports - PCI, formed by a group of para athletes to ensure fair play, wrote in the mail against the selection of some officials.The letter, of which TOI has a copy, names three per sons who figure in the list as team escort and personal escort as those who got into the contingent through the back door.“Two of them have no involvement in para sports while the other is a para athlete and hence cannot be an escort to para athlete,” the Clean Para Sports team alleged. According to sources, at least in two disciplines -- para athletics and para powerlifting -- officials have been selected and cleared by the PCI in an arbitrary manner.“For many officials, it is a jolly trip at government expense after making the squad as coach, escort etc. A look at the list of officials reveals that quite a few of them are with the PCI office and not qualified to make the contingent as coaches. There have been reports during previous trips that many of those who travel as escorts disappear once they reach the venue,” they said.According to the communication from the ministry, PCI will ensure that any per son, if she is holding an elected position in EC of PCI, any NSF or any sports body, whose name has been included in the list of team officials, will be treated at no cost to the government.","Clean Para Sports - PCI, formed by a group of para athletes to ensure fair play, wrote in the mail against the selection of some officials.

Owens' insistence on a virtual appearance, citing a scheduling conflict with her own show, was rejected by TPUSA, leading to her exclusion from the December 15 event. The dispute intensifies scrutiny on the controversial matter.

Livestream dispute ends with Candace Owens excluded after she pushes for virtual appearance





The tense back-and-forth between Candace Owens and Turning Point USA has taken a sharp turn, as TPUSA’s Blake Neff announced the organization will move forward with a livestream addressing allegations tied to Charlie Kirk ’s death, without Owens participating. The conservative commentator had previously suggested that TPUSA “betrayed” Kirk, who was assassinated on September 10, and was offered a chance to discuss her claims on The Charlie Kirk Show.At first, Owens appeared ready to join in, but a clash over whether she would appear in person or remotely triggered an online debate over her intentions. Now, TPUSA has shut the door on her involvement, escalating what has quickly turned into one of the most controversial moments in conservative media this year.The conflict erupted when Owens claimed that the scheduled December 15 livestream was planned without consulting her. Neff responded publicly on X, reminding her that TPUSA had already committed to issuing a formal response: “Yesterday, we made it clear that we would be scheduling a formal response to the allegations and accusations you have made. We've decided that response will be delivered during a livestream on December 15th. ”He then delivered a decisive message: “Thank you for your response letting us know you will not be joining the in-person conversation.We will be proceeding without you.”Owens, however, insisted she never refused to participate. She argued that she could not attend in person, citing that she hosts her own live show at the same time. “December 15th does not work in-person and 2pm PT is also literal time I do my podcast LIVE everyday (which you knew), but we will happily cancel the daily podcast and will join you guys virtually instead for the livestream on the 15th if that works on your end?”Her proposal to participate remotely appears to have been rejected, sparking new accusations online that Owens was trying to avoid a direct confrontation. While she maintains she is willing to debate, TPUSA has clearly decided to move on without her.With Kirk’s death still shrouded in speculation and Owens’ accusations gaining traction without evidence, the upcoming livestream is expected to intensify scrutiny around both sides. One thing is certain: even before the broadcast airs, the battle over who controls this narrative has already begun.Also Read: “She’s a liar and a con artist”: Candace Owens roasted for ‘running scared’ from TPUSA's Charlie Kirk livestream she bragged she’d win","Candace Owens and Turning Point USA have been involved in a public spat.

Planning your year around UAE holidays





Local authorities may add extra holidays

Public holidays are not carried forward if they fall on weekends or overlap with another holiday

Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, so slight adjustments are possible





Residents of the UAE have much to look forward to in 2026, with several public holidays promising opportunities for long weekends and family time. From Eid celebrations to the National Day, a mix of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar holidays will shape the holiday calendar. Here is a detailed guide to all predicted public holidays, how they are determined, and tips to plan your time off.UAE public holidays are a combination of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar calendar dates. Gregorian holidays, such as New Year’s Day and National Day, occur on the same date each year. Islamic holidays, including Eid Al Fitr, Eid Al Adha, Islamic New Year, and Prophet Muhammad’s Birthday (PBUH), shift each year based on moon sightings.The UAE Public Holiday Law, established in April 2024 and implemented from January 2025, allows certain holidays to be shifted to the start or end of the week to create long weekends, except for Eid holidays. Cabinet Resolution No. 27 of 2024 also permits local governments to declare additional holidays for special occasions.Holidays that fall on weekends or coincide with another public holiday are not carried forward, but 2026 predictions indicate no overlap between Islamic holidays and Gregorian holidays.Residents in the UAE can expect at least 12 public holidays in 2026. While final dates depend on moon sightings and government announcements, current predictions give a clear picture of the likely schedule:Transferable holidays: Islamic holidays such as Eid Al Fitr and Eid Al Adha are not transferable. Other holidays, including the Islamic New Year, Prophet’s Birthday, and National Day, may be moved to create long weekends based on Cabinet resolutions.2026 promises several opportunities for extended breaks:Residents are advised to plan ahead, as Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, which may adjust official dates.Public and private schools in the UAE align their breaks with national holidays, though exact dates differ by curriculum and school authority:This schedule helps families coordinate holidays and make the most of predicted long weekends.Understanding the mix of fixed and lunar based holidays allows residents to strategically plan annual leave. For example, taking just a few days off around Eid or National Day can maximize time away from work. While the UAE government confirms official dates closer to each holiday, these predictions serve as a reliable guide for 2026.Residents should note:With this guide, UAE residents can look forward to a year of well timed breaks, long weekends, and ample family and leisure time.","UAE residents in 2026 can enjoy 12 public holidays, including Eid, National Day, and school breaks.

Staff at a Virginia liquor store turned up for work on Saturday to find the aftermath of what looked like a small riot: smashed whisky bottles, liquor pooling across the floor and one very drunk raccoon passed out in the bathroom.The Ashland ABC store had been closed for Thanksgiving when it suffered what staff later dubbed a “Black Friday break-in”. When they opened up the next morning, they followed a trail of broken glass and spilled spirits to the lavatory, where the “masked bandit” was found spread-eagled between the toilet and the bin, having apparently helped itself to the bottom shelf.“He fell through one of the ceiling tiles and went on a full-blown rampage, drinking everything,” Samantha Martin, an animal control officer in Hanover County, told the. BBC News reported that among the wreckage was the animal’s apparent drink of choice: scotch.Only one blurry CCTV still exists of the boozy intruder, so no one knows exactly how much it managed to knock back before losing consciousness. Staff called Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter, and Martin collected the “suspect” for what the shelter jokingly described as questioning.In a Facebook post about the incident, the shelter wrote: “On Saturday morning, Officer Martin responded to an unusual call at the Ashland ABC Store.Upon arrival, she discovered the ‘suspect’ had broken in, ransacked several shelves, and then… passed out in the bathroom. The suspect? A very intoxicated raccoon.”The shelter confirmed the animal was, indeed, drunk, but otherwise unharmed. “After a few hours of sleep and zero signs of injury (other than maybe a hangover and poor life choices), he was safely released back to the wild, hopefully having learned that breaking and entering is not the answer,” the post added. Martin later deadpanned that it was “just another day in the life of an animal control officer”.The Ashland ABC store thanked Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter on social media for its professionalism and for giving the visitor “a sober ride home”.The Hanover shelter, which looks after rescued and unwanted animals, says on its website : “The shelter provides veterinarian care for homeless or unwanted animals until they are adopted or placed with an animal rescue organization.”Raccoons are, in many ways, built for this kind of misadventure. They’ve adapted so successfully to human environments that researchers are starting to see physical changes associated with early domestication. “Wherever humans go, there is trash,” Dr Raffaela Lesch, a biologist at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, recently told. “Animals love our trash. It’s an easy source of food. All they have to do is endure our presence, not be aggressive, and then they can feast on anything we throw away.”In Ashland, Virginia, one raccoon appears to have taken that principle a step further: skip the bin, go straight for the bar.","The Ashland ABC store had been closed for Thanksgiving when it suffered what staff later dubbed a “Black Friday break-in” When they opened up the next morning, they followed a trail of broken glass and spilled spirits to the lavatory, where the “masked bandit” was found spread-eagled between the toilet and the bin.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125752813,imgsize-1157838,width-400,resizemode-4/drunk-raccoon-middle-aged-recently-divorced-rough-week.jpg"

King Charles 'Closes Doors' On Prince Harry Reunion? U.S. State Visit Sparks Buzz

ROYAL FAMILY IS NOT FULLY BRITISH

King George V: the king who rebranded the monarchy



Cue 1917:

But the German roots didn’t magically vanish



The irony of modern royal diplomacy



How German were the Windsors?



Windsor today: British by name, European by blood







If there is one thing the British monarchy excels at, it is the illusion of eternal Britishness. The crowns stay polished, the speeches stay gentle, and the castles stay photogenic. But the royal family itself? That’s a different story. Because the Windsors — the quintessentially British Windsors — used to be so German that Oktoberfest might as well have been a royal family reunion.And nothing makes this irony sharper than the modern Britain–Germany camaraderie you see at state banquets, where chandeliers glow, orchestras play, and royal conversation politely avoids mentioning that the family tree once spoke flawless High German. So let’s dive in.Once upon a time, they were the House of Saxe-Coburg and GothaThe Windsors weren’t always Windsors. Their original name was the extremely German Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, a dynastic title straight out of a Wagner opera. It started with Queen Victoria, whose mother was German, and whose beloved Prince Albert was so thoroughly German that he practically radiated orderliness and efficient Christmas tree placement.The Victorian era might feel like a golden age of Britishness now, but genealogically, it was as German as pretzels and philosophy.When Victoria died in 1901, her son Edward VII inherited the throne — and the German surname. But the real plot twist arrived with his son.George V inherited a country at war with Germany. Londoners were smashing sauerkraut barrels, dachshunds were being renamed “liberty hounds,” and a royal family with a German surname was not the vibe.The greatest royal PR move in history. With one proclamation, George V dumped Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and adopted a name so aggressively British it could have worn tweed: Windsor.Inspired by Windsor Castle, it sounded ancient, noble and patriotic — despite being brand new. The ink dried on the paperwork, the palace letterheads were destroyed, and Britain exhaled in relief. The monarchy was now officially British… at least on paper.The rebrand was brilliant, but the genealogy? Still very German.Some highlights: Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth II’s husband, was born into the Greek royal family but descended from German houses with names that could fill three pages of a passport.Queen Mary, wife of George V, was born Mary of Teck — another German branch. Charles III descends from a dense web of German royals stretching across Bavaria, Hanover, Hesse and more. If you printed the family tree and colour-coded the German connections, Buckingham Palace would glow a healthy bratwurst shade. Even today, royal DNA is basically a European buffet.Today, when British monarchs host German leaders with warm speeches about shared values, defence cooperation, and European unity, history quietly smiles. The royal family, once so German it had to rename itself to survive, now plays host with the confidence of a dynasty that has fully assimilated — yet never fully forgotten its origins.You can picture the scene: chandeliers twinkling, musicians playing, German guests mingling with British aristocrats, and a monarch whose ancestors once came from the very lands his guests represent.If there were ever a moment for history to wink, this is it.On a scale from 1 to schnitzel: a firm bratwurst-with-sauerkraut.Their original house — Saxe-Coburg and Gotha — was authentically, unmistakably German. Even the Christmas tree tradition Britain loves so dearly was imported directly by Prince Albert. Victorian Christmas? Basically a festive German cultural takeover wrapped in tinsel.During World War I, anti-German sentiment became so strong that the press openly questioned whether the monarchy was too German to rule. The rebrand to Windsor wasn’t just cosmetic — it was survival.Today the Windsors stand as a symbol of British stability. They sip tea, wave from balconies, and look as though their roots stretch back to Roman Britain. But behind the curated iconography is a family assembled by centuries of intermarriage across Europe.Britishness, in their case, is more costume than chromosome. And that is exactly why their history is so deliciously ironic.In conclusion: the Windsors are Britain’s most successful German importBavarian beer is great, German engineering is legendary, but the most successful German export to the UK was the British royal family itself.A dynasty that began with a German prince and a half-German queen reinvented itself with one stroke of marketing genius — and became the very embodiment of British identity. They may be the Windsors now, but their roots stretch deep into the forests of central Europe. Long live the British monarchy. Or in the original tongue: Lang lebe die Windsors.","The Windsors weren’t always Windsors.

LONDON: ""What's it about?"" was a frequent response from bemused theatre-goers to ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"", Tom Stoppard's first stage triumph. Tired of being asked, Stoppard is said to have replied to a woman outside a theatre on Broadway: ""It's about to make me very rich. ""He later questioned whether he had said ""very"", Hermione Lee writes in Stoppard's authorised biography, but he had undoubtedly managed to transform his previously precarious finances.For every puzzled spectator, there were many more ecstatic fans and critics, dazzled by the wit, brilliant wordplay and sheer daring of a young playwright who had turned Shakespeare inside out and placed the spotlight, not on the eponymous Hamlet, but on two minor characters from the same play.First performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1966, the following year, ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"" made Stoppard, at the age of 29, the youngest playwright to be staged at the National Theatre in London. From there, the play went to Broadway and had more than 250 productions worldwide over its first decade.Stoppard's career flourished for decades more, embracing stage, screen and radio, and demonstrating his thirst to tackle any subject -- from mathematics to Dadaist art to landscape gardening.Stoppard's many other successes included ""The Real Inspector Hound"", which parodied stage whodunnits and sent up theatre critics, ""Jumpers"", a 1.5 million word epic that delighted and confused its public, and ""Night and Day"", a satire on the British media.His densely packed, intricately constructed plays were based on extensive research. ""Arcadia"", in 1993, considered by many critics to be his masterpiece, blended chaos theory, Isaac Newton and the poet Lord Byron's love life.The word Stoppardian, first recorded in 1978, meanwhile entered the Oxford English Dictionary. It refers to the use of verbal gymnastics while addressing philosophical concepts. The honours he won included an Oscar for co-authoring the screenplay of the 1998 hit film ""Shakespeare in Love"", and a record five Tony awards for Best Play.He died at home in Dorset, surrounded by his family, his agent said Saturday.Stoppard was born Tomas Straussler on July 3, 1937 in what was then Czechoslovakia, the son of Eugen Straussler, a doctor, and Marta (or Martha), nee Beckova, who had trained as a nurse. The Jewish family fled the Nazis and moved to Singapore when he was an infant. Singapore in turn became unsafe. With his mother and elder brother Peter, he escaped to India. His father stayed behind and died while fleeing after Singapore fell to the Japanese.In India, Marta Straussler married a British army major, Kenneth Stoppard, and the family moved to England.Boarding school followed at Pocklington in Yorkshire, where Tom Stoppard loved cricket more than drama and learned how to be British, which Major Stoppard considered the ultimate nationality.The adult Stoppard, who rediscovered decades later the Jewish roots that he explored in his final play, would accuse his stepfather of ""an innate antisemitism"".","Stoppard was born Tomas Straussler on July 3, 1937 in what was then Czechoslovakia.

British playwright and screenwriter Tom Stoppard died at the age of 88 on Saturday.

His career spanned over six decades, producing a string of acclaimed plays and screenplays. He was best known for works like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Arcadia, The Real Thing and Leopoldstadt.His name extended beyond the theatre. Stoppard also wrote for radio, television and film. Among his celebrated screen credits was the Academy Award–winning screenplay for Shakespeare in Love (1998), shared with Marc Norman.Stoppard’s body of work stood out for its combination of wit, intellectual depth and emotional honesty. His plays often explored philosophy, history, identity and human relationships and even comedic flair.He was born in 1937 in Czechoslovakia (Now Czech Republic). He fled Nazi persecution as a child and eventually settled in Britain, where he adopted the name Tom Stoppard. His early life experiences, personal loss, and later discovering his Jewish heritage helped shape the themes and emotional core of many of his later works.In 2012, Stoppard attended the Jaipur Literature Festival, one of the largest literary gatherings in the world. His presence drew huge attention from literature enthusiasts and aspiring writers, eager to hear insights. During the festival, Stoppard spoke about the craft of playwriting, the interplay of history and philosophy in drama, and his personal journey from Czechoslovakia to Britain.Stoppard is survived by his family, children and grandchildren.","Stoppard was regarded as one of the greatest dramatists of his generation.

Teenage Girl Killed In Alleged Honour Killing Sparks International Outrage | WATCH





An 18-year-old girl was killed by her father and two brothers because they believed her “Western behaviour” was bringing shame to the family, Dutch prosecutors said.Ryan Al Najjar was found on 28 May 2024 in a swamp in northern Netherlands — gagged, tied with tape and submerged, six days after she went missing from her home in Joure.Prosecutors say Ryan had stopped wearing a headscarf, interacted with boys and was active on social media, which her family saw as unacceptable.""The immediate cause of her death appears to be a live video on TikTok, showing Ryan without a headscarf and wearing makeup,"" prosecutors said.On the night before the murder, her brothers picked her up from a house in Rotterdam and drove her to a remote area, where their father joined them.DNA from her father, Khaled, was found under her fingernails, suggesting he was present during the killing, which happened shortly after midnight on 22 May 2024.In court, the prosecutor described the fear Ryan must have felt— alone, in the dark, far from help.“What must she have feared. In the middle of the night, in complete darkness, in a completely isolated place,” the prosecutor said, as quoted by New York Post.He later emailed Dutch media, admitting to killing his daughter but claiming his sons were not involved. However, investigators say intercepted messages show the brothers did take part.“Khaled was the driving force, but without his sons, Ryan would not have been there at all,” prosecutors said.The brothers each face up to 20 years in prison. Khaled could receive 25 years when he is tried in absentia.Defence lawyers will present their arguments on Monday, and the court is expected to deliver its verdict on 5 January 2026.","Ryan Al Najjar was found on 28 May 2024 in a swamp in northern Netherlands.

What to know about assisted death in Germany

What to know about assisted death services in the world





The founder of Swiss right-to-die group Dignitas has died through assisted death, the association said Saturday.Ludwig A. Minelli was a pioneer in the field of assisted death, having led efforts to decriminalize it in Germany in 2020.Minelli died November 29, 2025, shortly before his 93rd birthday.He founded the association ""Dignitas – To live with dignity – To die with dignity"" in 1998 and faced numerous legal challenges. He made several successful appeals to the Swiss Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).Minelli began his career as a journalist with a Swiss newspaper in 1956 and was the first correspondent for the German news magazine Der Spiegel in Switzerland between 1964 and 1974.He later studied law and went on to make a lasting impact on Swiss legislation. Dignitas noted a 2011 ECHR ruling that recognized the right of a person capable of judgment to decide the manner and timing of their own end of life.The organization described Minelli as a ""tenacious and unflinching warrior"" when it came to defending people's autonomy to make fundamental decisions about their lives.Dignitas said Minelli's work was crucial to the decriminalization of assisted suicide services in Germany.In 2020, Germany's Federal Constitutional Court ruled that individuals have a constitutional right to a self-determined death.In a recent interview with German outlet FOCUS Online, Dr. Martin Goßmann, head of the medical team at the German Assisted Dying Association, said third parties can offer assistance such as medical or legal advice, but the patient must carry out the act of ingesting the life-ending drug.Euthanasia, where another person actively helps someone die at their request, remains punishable by law in Germany.Dignitas said it currently has about 10,000 members and offers assisted death or accompanied suicide services to people from around the world.Assisted death is fully or conditionally available in Australia, New Zealand, and several European countries, including Austria, Belgium, Italy, and the Netherlands, according to the campaign group Dignity in Dying.Canada, Colombia, Cuba, and Ecuador also offer services for people experiencing unbearable suffering, the group said.In the US, assisted death is legal for terminally ill people in 10 states.","Ludwig A.

Japanese “One Piece” singer Maki Otsuki’s concert in Shanghai was abruptly cut short on Friday night, as rising diplomatic tensions between China and Japan spilled directly onto the stage.Fans were left stunned when the lights went out mid-song and staff moved in, leading Otsuki offstage without explanation. Her management later confirmed she had been forced to stop ""due to unavoidable circumstances” on Friday “even though she was in the middle of performing”, despite being only partway through her set.A video circulating online shows the exact moment the performance was halted — music cutting out, stage lights shutting down, and visibly confused fans calling out as Otsuki is calmly escorted away by staff.Otsuki, best known for singing the first ending theme of the hit anime, had been scheduled to perform for two days at the Bandai Namco Festival 2025 in Shanghai. But her interrupted performance quickly became the latest cultural casualty in a growing list of cancellations affecting exchanges between Asia’s two largest economies.The chill in relations follows remarks earlier this month from Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi, suggesting Japan could intervene militarily if Taiwan were attacked. Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its territory, reacted with fury — summoning Japan’s ambassador and issuing a travel warning urging Chinese citizens to avoid Japan. The fallout has rippled into the entertainment world.This isn’t an isolated incident. Other Japanese artists—including pop icon Ayumi Hamasaki and acclaimed jazz pianist Hiromi Uehara—have had their China shows scrapped in recent days.","Maki Otsuki's concert in Shanghai abruptly cut short on Friday night.
