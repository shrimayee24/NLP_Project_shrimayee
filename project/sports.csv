Stephen A. Smith defends Shedeur Sanders after silent press meet

“I’m not gonna overreact to it. I’m just gonna say that he has to know that other people are going to look at him and consider that immature,”

“I don’t consider him immature. I think that he can play, I think that he’s a leader. I think that a lot is prejudged when it comes to him. I think it’s unfair.”

“Every word he says, we micromanage, we dissect, and folks judge him accordingly.

I think that was his way of saying, ‘You know what? If you don’t hear anything that I have to say, O.K., that’s cool.’”

Cam Newton on Shedeur Sanders’ role with Browns and business value

“circus-like attention.”

“If we cut Shedeur, that would be bad for business. He moves the needle for Cleveland in a way no one else has,”

Shedeur Sanders made headlines in Cleveland, Ohio, on October 1, 2025, after a strange post-practice media session. Reporters asked about the Cleveland Browns’ quarterback decision, but Sanders did not speak a single word. Instead, he mimed his answers and smiled, leaving many confused. The team had just named Dillon Gabriel as starter and Joe Flacco as backup, putting Sanders as the third quarterback. On October 2, 2025, ESPN’s First Take host Stephen A. Smith gave his reaction. He said people may judge Sanders as immature, but he thinks that view is unfair.Speaking on First Take on Thursday, Stephen A. Smith said he was not shocked by Sanders’ behavior but warned that the public may take it the wrong way.Smith said.Stephen A. Smith also pointed out that in today’s media world, every single word from Sanders is picked apart. He added:For Stephen A. Smith, the key point is that Shedeur Sanders will only be judged fairly once he actually plays snaps for the Browns. Until then, interviews, silent or not, will continue to spark outside criticism.Former NFL quarterback Cam Newton also shared his view on Shedeur Sanders in the latest episode of his 4th & 1 podcast. Newton said Sanders is a talented quarterback, but his presence brings what he calledHe explained that the Browns may keep Sanders not only for his football potential but also because of his value to the team’s brand.Newton said.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes Quiet After Charlie Kirk Shooting At Utah As Randi Mahomes And Tavia Hunt Speaks Out Newton also warned Sanders to prove himself through play, not off-field stories.

Both Smith and Newton agree: his real judgment will come only when he steps onto the field and plays in a competitive NFL game.","Shedeur Sanders made headlines in Cleveland, Ohio, on October 1, 2025, after a strange post-practice media session.

Boston Bruins’ Mark Kastelic charges at New York Ranger’s 6-foot-9 Matt Rempe refusing to flinch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/boston-bruins-mark-kastelic-charges-at-new-york-rangers-6-foot-9-matt-rempe-refusing-to-flinch/articleshow/124312790.cms,"Mark Kastelic of the Boston Bruins prepares for a faceoff against the Vegas Golden Knights (Image Source - Getty Images)

Why Mark Kastelic charged at Matt Rempe

What really happened in Boston Bruins vs New York Rangers game

During the preseason matchup between the Boston Bruins and the New York Rangers, a key confrontation unfolded between forward Mark Kastelic and Rangers forward Matt Rempe. This incident happened in the last preseason game ahead of the Bruins' regular season debut.At the conclusion of the first period in Boston's last preseason game against New York at TD Garden. This was the Bruins' final rehearsal before their season opener on Wednesday, October 8, 2025.Kastelic started the brawl after both players left the penalty box, charging at Rempe with only five seconds left in the period. This was triggered by their earlier argument and penalties, as they ""got after it again"" immediately upon release.Kastelic's move was a testament to his character as a gritty forward who stands his ground, even when he's at a disadvantage in height (6-foot-4 vs. 6-foot-9), weight (234 pounds vs. 261 pounds), and reach compared to Rempe.As a new member of the Bruins after a June 2024 trade from the Ottawa Senators that involved goaltender Linus Ullmark, Kastelic has made it clear that he takes pride in bottom-six roles that require toughness and penalty killing.Kastelic mentioned to the press at Warrior Ice Arena, ""Who won the bout? Probably him,"" talking about a previous match with his current teammate Jeannot, showcasing his readiness to take on challenging rivals.This incident happened after a bunch of physical plays. Bruins forward Tanner Jeannot executed a clean hit on Rangers defenseman Braden Schneider. Then, Kastelic and Rempe got into a verbal spat, leading to coincidental two-minute penalties for unsportsmanlike conduct with 2:33 to go in the period.These penalties were described as ""ticky-tacky off-setting penalties"" The Bruins seemed to have their sights set on Rempe early on, with Jeannot slamming him into the boards and Kastelic pushing him around on the following shift.This physicality is in line with earlier preseason games between the teams. On September 22, 2024, during a preseason match, a brawl broke out involving Kastelic and other players such as Victor Mancini, Brennan Othmann, and Parker Wotherspoon near the Rangers' net. Kastelic was eager to play physically in that game, but he didn't end up fighting.In the scuffle, both players were busy blocking each other's arms, and neither of them landed any direct hits at the start. As they twirled down to the ice, Rempe landed a couple of grazing punches on the back of Kastelic's helmet. The fight was noted as ""basically a draw"" in an X post noting Rempe landed more punches. The Bruins had their first fight of the preseason here. Kastelic is known for his fighting history, which includes a bout with Connor Mackey.Mark Kastelic proved he's ready to rise to the challenge, holding his own even when facing a much larger rival.Also Read: Kirill Kaprizov’s net worth in 2025: How his record-breaking Minnesota Wild contract could skyrocket his fortune","Boston Bruins forward Mark Kastelic charged at New York Rangers forward Matt Rempe.

It's our cancer.""According to Union, she was scared and even worried that she would have to raise the kids in Dwyane Wade’s absence. The Bring It On star further mentioned,""I'll speak for myself when I say that the decisions that he was making hurt me about his cancer. It felt like, 'Oh, you're trying to kill me.And I'm going to be alone raising these kids.

When you mention year nine being hard, he hadn’t revealed his cancer diagnosis and his own cancer journey, so now we can put it in more context.”She further elaborated,""Obviously him getting that diagnosis was traumatic for him: Being faced with your own mortality in your early 40s, and you’re like, ‘Am I going to be here to see my family? Who am I without this big life, and without this healthy body? But you also don’t understand the journey and the toll that it takes on your marriage, on your family, on your kids.”After being married for 11 long years, Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union share a daughter named Kaavia via surrogacy.

Kayla Nicole, ex-girlfriend of NFL star Travis Kelce , has seemingly responded to Taylor Swift ’s rumored diss track “Opalite” from her new album The Life of a Showgirl. After fans speculated that Swift’s lyrics targeted her, Nicole took to Instagram with cryptic yet confident posts, sparking debate over whether she was subtly clapping back at the pop superstar.It didn’t take long for Kayla Nicole, the ex-girlfriend of NFL star Travis Kelce, to grab headlines again — this time in response to a rumored diss from Taylor Swift’s latest album, The Life of a Showgirl. Fans believe Swift’s track “Opalite” takes subtle aim at Nicole, prompting a series of cryptic Instagram posts that many interpret as a classy clapback.Nicole, who dated Kelce before his high-profile relationship with the pop icon, posted a series of elegant photos wearing a silk brown dress with the caption, “What an honor to share a table with some of the most iconic ‘girlfriends’ of all time.” She added, “Women whose art has been a mirror and a reminder of what’s possible at every stage of my womanhood.”The timing of Nicole’s posts was impossible to ignore, especially after Swift’s Opalite sparked speculation that she was referencing Kelce’s ex. One lyric in particular — “You couldn’t understand it, why you felt alone / You were in it for real, she was in her phone / And you were just a pose” — drew attention, as it appeared to reference Kelce’s past comments about Nicole being “too focused on her phone” during their relationship.Nicole further fueled the conversation by sharing a clip from America’s Next Top Model, featuring Tyra Banks asking Eva Marcille, “How do you compare yourself to the other girls out there?” to which Marcille replies, “I don’t compare myself to other girls. I’m Eva. I’m no comparison to anyone else.” The message, though subtle, spoke volumes.Also Read: How Travis Kelce pulled off his magical proposal: Taylor Swift shares the story behind the backyard transformation Swift and Kelce began dating in 2023 and announced their engagement in August 2025, marking one of pop culture’s most talked-about relationships.

Inside the final months that turned from legal battle to tragedy for Kyren Lacy

Fans and teammates unite to remember Lacy as a gentle soul and Nabers’ tribute becomes a message of brotherhood

New York Giants wide receiver Malik Nabers has spoken out in anguish after the tragic death of his former LSU teammate Kyren Lacy, accusing the justice system of destroying reputations before facts are known. The 22-year-old rookie shared a powerful message on Instagram following Lacy’s death on April 12, 2025 — a day before the former LSU receiver was due to appear before a grand jury in Louisiana. Lacy had been charged in connection with a December 2024 car crash that killed a 78-year-old man, but his attorney maintained that new evidence was proving his innocence in the weeks leading up to his death.Only got to see his teammate’s name trending for the wrong reasons, Nabers poured out his frustration at how the media moved on once facts began to shift in Lacy’s favor. Posting a picture of his late friend, he wrote: “Bashed my dawg name! Shi crazy. Da Wrld sick gang. Dey put you on every news channel and sport network when you ‘allegedly’ charged wit sum. But when da truth comes out mfs dnt say nun and go in silence.”In another story, his emotions spilled over again as he added, “All my dawgs fallin to the same ‘justice system’ FOH. Shi a joke! Free u.” His words reflected a deep mix of grief, anger, and loyalty — a plea for fairness in a system he believes failed his brother long before his death.According to the Louisiana State Police, Lacy was charged with negligent homicide and felony hit-and-run after allegedly causing a fatal crash while trying to pass slower vehicles on a rural highway. The victim, identified as Donald Hymel, 78, was pronounced dead at the scene.Lacy’s attorney Matt Ory later revealed new footage and vehicle data that, according to him, indicated Lacy’s car was not involved in the impact. Ory said his client was finally beginning to feel hopeful again before tragedy struck. Lacy died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound during a brief police pursuit in Houston after a relative reported a domestic disturbance. His death came one day before the grand jury hearing that could have cleared his name.For Nabers and the LSU football community, the story isn’t just about a case — it’s about how quickly judgment spreads and how silence follows when truth surfaces. Many of their former teammates have joined in remembering Lacy as a humble and kind-hearted competitor whose quiet determination inspired everyone around him.During Giants training camp, Nabers wore thigh pads with Lacy’s face printed on them — a subtle yet powerful tribute that fans praised as heartfelt. Shortly after his death, Nabers wrote, “Pain. Numb. Sad… Broken. Devastated… Why you ain’t call leek brudda… ya f—in hurt me bruh!!!”The tragedy has left the football world shaken, serving as a reminder that even in a sport built on strength and glory, some of its brightest souls fight silent battles off the field. And for Malik Nabers, every game, every play, and every tribute from here on will carry the memory of a brother gone too soon, and the truth he wished the world had seen sooner.Also read: Fans can't get enough of Peter, Kirk Herbstreit’s adorable golden retriever, who stole smiles and hearts at Rams vs. 49ers","Kyren Lacy died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 12, 2025.

How the Houston Texans can exploit Baltimore Ravens' weakness

Houston Texans remain relatively healthy despite Jaylen Reed Folorunso Fatukasi missing Week 5

The Baltimore Ravens are all set to clash with the Houston Texans in a key Week 5 showdown on October 5, 2025, at M&T Bank Stadium, with the game starting at 1 p.m. ET. Both teams head into this contest with the same 1-3 records, which is disappointing considering they both topped their divisions in 2024.The Ravens have had a tough start, worsened by a series of injuries, particularly the loss of their star quarterback Lamar Jackson , who is sidelined with a hamstring injury from their Week 4 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.Without Lamar Jackson , the Baltimore Ravens are missing their dynamic dual-threat quarterback, which forces them to adopt a more traditional pocket-passing strategy with Cooper Rush. Analysts indicate that this could allow the Houston Texans' defense to exert effective pressure.Houston's pass rush, led by players like Will Anderson Jr., might capitalize on Baltimore's possibly weakened offensive line if tackle Ronnie Stanley (who is questionable due to an ankle injury) is not fully available.The Baltimore defense is feeling the impact of linebacker Roquan Smith and cornerbacks Marlon Humphrey and Chidobe Awuzie being out, which opens up weaknesses in the secondary and run defense that Texans quarterback C.J.Stroud and his receivers can take advantage of.Analysts from Locked On Texans and other sources are pointing out that the Ravens' rush defense has been shaky this season, giving Houston's running game a ""golden ticket"" to keep up and control the game clock.Moreover, with a number of Pro Bowlers missing, including Smith and Humphrey, Houston's up-and-coming players like Stroud could take advantage of mismatches in coverage.The Ravens hold a 5-0 record against the Texans when Jackson plays, but his absence, coupled with defensive injuries, changes the odds, with most experts leaning towards Houston for a road win.The Texans' offensive coordinator has shown a need to exploit Baltimore's injury-stricken unit, as mentioned in Acast podcast discussions, by focusing on quick passes and getting the run game going early.The Houston Texans are managing some injuries, yet they look healthier overall, based on their Week 5 injury report from the team's site and USA Today. Missing the game are safety Jaylen Reed (knee), defensive tackle Folorunso Fatukasi (shoulder), and defensive end Denico Autry (knee).Other players such as running back Joe Mixon and safety Jimmie Ward have been mentioned in recent reports but are not marked as out for this game. Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans pointed out Jackson's role in a pre-game press conference, stressing how vital a player like Jackson is to any team, emphasizing the strategic adjustments without him. Ryans' statements were made to reporters during talks about the Texans' game strategy against Baltimore.If Lamar Jackson isn't playing, the Houston Texans gain a noticeable advantage. Baltimore's ability to adjust will be put to the test, and Houston has a solid opportunity to take control early on if they make the right moves.Also Read: Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show sends MAGA into meltdown as NFL refuses to bow to conservative rage","The Baltimore Ravens and Houston Texans meet in a key Week 5 showdown on October 5, 2025, at M&T Bank Stadium, with the game starting at 1 p.m. ET.

Philadelphia 76ers are being cautious with Joel Embiid's health

Joel Embiid is major instrument in Philadelphia 76ers success during upcoming season

Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers, has been sidelined due to a left knee injury since March of 2025. Right before the regular season was to end for the 2024-25 season, the injury changed the course of the game for Embiid as well as the Sixers. While the player did give a positive update during his NBA Media Day appearance, and has also traveled to Abu Dhabi with the team for their preseason game against the New York Knicks, the team is taking a cautious approach with their star center.The Philadelphia 76ers are prioritizing Joel Embiid's long-term health, making sure that he's fully recovered from the arthroscopic surgery performed in April, before he comes back to play for the team full on. Embiid's injury history has led the team to adopt a very meticulous recovery strategy, focusing more on his rehabilitation rather than forcing him to participate in the preseason games against the New York Knicks.Embiid did travel to Abu Dhabi for the NBA Abu Dhabi Games 2025, one of the seven overseas showcases by the league this season, but he did not play the first game, and is not likely to make an appearance in the second one either.Although he did appear healthy during the NBA Media Day, and looked to be in good spirits, the Sixers are not rushing to get him playing just yet.The upcoming season for the Philadelphia 76ers is very important. Their last season ended without the team qualifying for the Playoffs, so it will be important for the Sixers to try and make better play in the upcoming season. And for that, they will need their star players in perfect form, without an injury threatening their playtime.Joel Embiid will be at the centre of their strategy to get to the top. So even if he does not play during the preseason, the Sixers main aim would be to have him perfectly healthy before regular season begins later this month. The Sixers unfortunately lost their first game in Abu Dhabi against the New York Knicks, and will be facing them again tomorrow, on October 4. After that, their first game in the regular season will be against the Boston Celtics on October 22.Also Read: NBA Abu Dhabi Games 2025: Philadelphia 76ers and New York Knicks take on Arabian Gulf","Philadelphia 76ers are being cautious with Joel Embiid's health.

Rohit Sharma removed as India ODI captain, a glorious era comes to an end

Poll What are your thoughts on Shubman Gill taking over as captain? Good choice, he is young and talented Too soon, Rohit should have continued

The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) made a surprising announcement on October 4th regarding the ODI team. This decision marked the end of Rohit Sharma 's captaincy era, who was India's second most successful captain after MS Dhoni , with Shubman Gill taking over as the new captain.Former cricketer Mohammad Kaif expressed his views about the BCCI's decision through a video. In the video, he highlighted Rohit Sharma's accomplishments and qualities.""Rohit Sharma gave India 16 years, but we couldn't give him even one. As captain, he has won 15 out of 16 ICC events, losing one match, the 2023 final. The Champions Trophy was the last match of 2025, he was the player of the match and won the trophy. He will also win the 2024 World Cup,"" Kaif said in a video posted on X.""Rohit showed magnanimity and retired after winning the World Cup because now, to give a chance to new players, he himself stepped down. He stayed out of the limelight for a few days, and then some players came and his captaincy was gone.""There is an example in India that as long as your time is there, you should continue it, but Rohit did not do that.

He later retired from Test cricket during IPL 2025, shortly before Virat Kohli 's retirement announcement, after a challenging performance in the last Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Questions now arise about Rohit's future in ODI cricket.

India’s emphatic victory over the West Indies on Saturday not only extended their unbeaten home streak but also set social media abuzz, thanks to Jasprit Bumrah’s playful Instagram post.Following the win, Bumrah took to social media to celebrate Mohammed Siraj ’s fiery spell, sharing a photo with the caption on his Instagram: “@Mohammedsirajofficial (fire emojis) bayki sab fake hai thik hain. (@Mohammedsirajofficial is real, everything else is fake. )”The line instantly went viral among cricket fans, as it referenced one of Siraj’s most famous clips from years ago, where he had said, “@Mohammedsirajofficial id is real, everything else is fake.”The clip had become an internet sensation back then, and Bumrah’s callback to it was both nostalgic and perfectly timed, a light-hearted salute to his teammate’s stellar performance.Siraj had been instrumental in India’s dominant innings-and-140-run win, returning impressive figures of 4-40 in the first innings and 3-31 in the second as the hosts rolled over the Windies twice inside three days at Ahmedabad’s colossal cricket stadium.

Shubman Gill named India's new ODI captain, replaces Rohit Sharma ahead of Australia series

Poll What factor do you think played the biggest role in Gill’s captaincy appointment? Performance in the Tests Dressing room dynamics Future planning for the 2027 World Cup

NEW DELHI: Shubman Gill 's appointment as India's ODI captain was always a question of when, and not why. The discussions had begun months before the official squad announcement on Saturday (October 4) for the Australia limited overs series.The decision makers got the conviction after seeing the side put up a solid show under the youngster in the five-Test series in England earlier in the year. It wasn't the mountain of runs he scored but how the dressing room reacted to the change in leadership. The thriller at The Oval - which helped India draw the series 2-2 - all but sealed the deal.Informal discussions on the road to the 2027 World Cup got underway, and they weren't random discussions. A blueprint was discussed with Gill and a pool of players was deliberated upon as the men who matter in Indian cricketing circles were convinced that Gill will have the armband for the multi-nation event two years later. The big question, however, remained how the BCCI will deal with Rohit Sharma who led India to Champions Trophy glory in his last assignment. Unlike Tests, there was the weight of runs behind him too but no guarantee of whether he would last the distance.The decision makers reasoned that two years was a long time and playing just one format wouldn't allow Rohit to have adequate game time. As far as Rohit was concerned, he continued doing his bit and made the right noises by clearing the necessary fitness tests and getting in shape before India's next assignment. The game time, however, which even Ajit Agarkar hinted at during the press-conference, was missing. The right-hander last played for India in the Champions Trophy and his last competitive outing came during the IPL for Mumbai Indians.Gill, meanwhile, scored a lot of runs in England, was appointed vice-captain for the Asia Cup T20 event and was given enough signals on the inevitable happening in the 50-over format too.Initially, the house remained divided as Rohit has been one of India's greatest white-ball captains and the call wasn't going to be that easy. But as the Australia tour got closer, the picture became much clearer. So much so that there was a section in Indian cricketing circles which wasn't in favour of sending both Rohit and Virat Kohli to Australia for ODIs. Surprisingly, the situation has come to a point where both Rohit and Virat are being looked at from the same microscope. Even after the vast difference in fitness levels, and an age gap of two years.""If we keep dragging things, it will only get complicated. And with two players - one 38 (Rohit) and other 36 (Kohli) - you can't place the early bets. Yes, even the younger ones could lose form and fitness but it's the safer bet,"" they reasoned.When there was so much deliberation around even the Australia ODIs, the World Cup seemed like a distant destination. And it still is. Agarkar asserted, ""I don't think we need to talk about it today,"" and there were strong hints of perform or perish applying to the modern-day greats going forward.They are expected to turn up for their domestic sides when there is no international cricket happening, and it will now be interesting to see whether both Rohit and Virat turn up for Mumbai and Delhi, respectively, in the Vijay Hazare Trophy.""I think that we've made it clearer a couple of years back. Whenever the guys are available, they should be playing domestic cricket. That's the only way you'll keep yourself sharp and play cricket,"" said Agarkar.After Tests, Indian cricket's transition in ODIs is also underway with a change of leadership and it now remains to be seen whether the two giants Rohit and Virat last the distance or run out of gas before the 2027 World Cup. The men who matter seem to be convinced that at least Rohit won't.","Shubman Gill named India's new ODI captain, replaces Rohit Sharma ahead of Australia series.

Poll Do you believe Abhishek Sharma made the right choice skipping his sister's wedding? Yes, for national duty. No, family should come first.

NEW DELHI: India A suffered a nine-wicket defeat to Australia A in the rain-affected second List A match on Friday, despite a gritty 94 from Tilak Varma and the personal sacrifice of Abhishek Sharma , who skipped his sister’s wedding to be part of the squad.Chasing India A’s modest total of 246, the Aussies were set 160 in 25 overs via the Duckworth-Lewis method after a three-hour rain delay. Australia A had already reached 48 without loss before the break, and once play resumed, McKenzie Harvey (70 not out off 49 balls) and Cooper Connolly (50 off 31) completed the chase in 16.4 overs.The visitors punished India’s bowling attack, hitting 22 fours and six sixes, with pacer Arshdeep Singh conceding 44 runs in four overs.While Abhishek Sharma had been drafted as a potential long-term opening option, his contribution was minimal, falling to Jack Edwards’ first delivery. Tilak Varma, however, showcased his class, holding the innings together with 94 off 122 balls, featuring five fours and four sixes. He shared a 101-run fourth-wicket partnership with Riyan Parag (58 off 54) and added lower-order contributions of 34 and 28 runs with Ravi Bishnoi and Arshdeep Singh respectively, narrowly missing out on a well-deserved century. Shreyas Iyer failed to fire, scoring only eight as India A slumped to 17 for 3 early on. Edwards was the pick of the Australian bowlers, finishing with four wickets.The defeat levels the three-match series at 1-1, setting up a high-stakes decider on Sunday.

Kyren Williams became the center of NFL attention Thursday after a critical fumble against the San Francisco 49ers, turning a moment of promise into a point of controversy. The Los Angeles Rams running back’s miscue, coming just shy of the goal line, immediately drew reactions from teammates, opponents, and fans alike. Social media lit up after cornerback Deommodore Lenore called it karma for Williams’ earlier touchdown taunt, while Williams himself accepted full responsibility and head coach Sean McVay remained unwavering in his support.The drama didn’t start with the fumble. Lenore revealed during an Instagram Live on Saturday that Williams had directed some harsh words his way after scoring a receiving touchdown. “He's got a fat mouth. He shouldn't have been talking. He pointed at me when he scored,” the cornerback said. Lenore’s comments quickly made waves online, with fans dissecting the moment as a turning point that foreshadowed the turnover.Williams faced the media with humility, openly acknowledging the misstep that cost his team dearly. “S—t sucks. I don’t know. I just got to hold onto the ball. I feel like I let the team down at the 1-yard line, not securing the one thing that matters and scoring the touchdown.So, I put this all on me, honestly, and just knowing that I got to be better. …We wouldn’t have even gotten there if I’d held onto the ball,” he said.

McVay’s measured reaction reflected his belief in Williams’ talent and his understanding that mistakes are part of the game.The incident has sparked a wider discussion about accountability and composure in high-stakes NFL moments.

The Dallas Cowboys are battling through an uneven start to their season — one win, two losses, and a tie that have left both fans and analysts questioning their form. Their lone victory came against the New York Giants, while defeats to the Philadelphia Eagles and Chicago Bears, plus a draw with the Green Bay Packers, have exposed the team’s inconsistency. Amid the scrutiny, wide receiver George Pickens has stepped forward to defend quarterback Dak Prescott, calling out the criticism directed at him and voicing full support as the Cowboys prepare for their crucial Week 5 clash against the New York Jets.As the Cowboys prepare for their Week 5 face-off against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium, Pickens made his feelings clear about the scrutiny surrounding Prescott.

The former NFL star’s “hands-off” approach has divided fans, with some praising his honesty while others accuse him of being too detached as a father.For years, Tom Brady was known for his precision and control on the football field, a quarterback who left nothing to chance. But when it comes to parenting his two youngest children, Benjamin and Vivian, the seven-time Super Bowl champion is embracing a very different philosophy: letting go.In a recent interview with Us Weekly, Brady opened up about his evolving role as a father, sharing that he’s learning to avoid micromanaging his kids’ lives. “I’m ready to kick out the door; it’s time for you to get off and get your responsibilities done,” Brady admitted, noting that independence is a vital part of growing up.Brady explained that his goal isn’t to mold his children into something specific but to support whatever matters most to them. “Whatever is most important to the kids, that’s what you should be,” he said, emphasizing that parenting should be about encouragement, not control.The retired quarterback also credited his own father, Tom Brady Sr., for influencing his mindset. Growing up, Brady says his dad provided structure and guidance without stifling his individuality, a balance he now tries to replicate with his own family.Rather than protecting Benjamin and Vivian from every mistake, Brady believes in letting life teach its own lessons. He wants them to make choices, face consequences, and learn accountability without constant supervision.His approach stands out in the world of celebrity parenting, where many high-profile families are scrutinized for being overly controlling or image-conscious. Instead, Brady is opting for a grounded, human-centered approach, trusting that his children will find their way, just as he once did.Also Read: Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bündchen deepfake scandal: Brazilian fraud ring made millions through fake Instagram promotions As his kids step into adolescence, Brady’s philosophy will face its true test.

Tyreek Hill's surgery successful, but contract and recovery timeline raise major questions

Contract complications could make a split inevitable

Tyreek Hill’s explosive NFL career has hit a major setback after the Miami Dolphins star suffered a devastating knee injury that ended his season and cast doubt on his future with the team. Following surgery to repair multiple ligament tears, Hill’s recovery timeline and contract situation have left both fans and analysts questioning what comes next for the All-Pro receiver.The Miami Dolphins may soon be forced to make one of their toughest roster decisions yet as Tyreek Hill’s future with the franchise hangs in the balance. The star wide receiver underwent surgery this week after dislocating his left knee and tearing multiple ligaments in Monday’s win over the New York Jets, an injury that has ended his season and potentially his Dolphins career.Hill’s agent, Drew Rosenhaus, offered a glimmer of hope, saying his client’s initial surgery went well and that “we would love to get together with them after the season and figure something out that works for both sides and continue his career here in Miami.” He added that Hill would not require a second procedure, a positive sign given the severity of most knee dislocations.Despite the optimism from Hill’s camp, sources around the league believe that his time in Miami could be nearing an end.Hill is currently in the second year of a three-year deal that carries massive cap implications for 2026. His $29.9 million base salary for that season is not guaranteed, and the Dolphins would owe him $16 million in bonuses if he remains on the roster beyond March 14, 2026.The structure of the deal, widely viewed as cap manipulation rather than a long-term commitment, could make an offseason release a financial necessity, especially with Miami’s tight cap situation and Hill’s uncertain recovery timeline.Also Read: Justin Tucker gears up for NFL return as sexual misconduct suspension reaches its final weeks Since joining Miami in 2022, Hill has transformed the team’s offense with his blistering speed and elite playmaking ability, forming one of the league’s most dangerous duos with Tua Tagovailoa .

Montreal Canadiens linked to Sidney Crosby in major trade buzz



Can the Penguins and Crosby align for one last Cup run?



Speculation around Sidney Crosby’s future has once again taken center stage in the NHL conversation. Despite the Pittsburgh Penguins captain’s firm declaration that he intends to finish his career in Pittsburgh, insider reports suggest that the Montreal Canadiens could be preparing to test that loyalty. According to renowned insider Darren Dreger, Montreal may be ready to “do whatever it takes” to bring Crosby home.Dreger’s comments on the Barn Burner Show sent ripples across the hockey world. He revealed that Canadiens GM Kent Hughes “would be willing to trade anything for Crosby” if the Penguins ever made him available. It’s a bold statement, one that reflects Montreal’s ambition to fast-track their rebuild and recapture their storied glory. For many, the idea of Crosby — a lifelong Penguins icon — in Canadiens red feels surreal, yet strangely fitting.Crosby’s connection to Montreal runs deep. He grew up a Canadiens fan, and his emotional ovation at the Bell Centre during the 4 Nations Face-Off earlier this year reignited long-standing speculation. Even though Crosby laughed it off, the admiration between him and the city was clear. A potential move to Montreal would not only reunite him with his childhood roots but also place him closer to home as his career enters its final stretch.For the Penguins, the question isn’t just about loyalty — it’s about opportunity. After missing the playoffs three straight years, GM Kyle Dubas faces mounting pressure to refresh the roster. Trading Crosby, while unthinkable to many fans, could yield a massive return, possibly involving top prospects like Ivan Demidov. Yet, as Dubas recently stated, such speculation is “an unnecessary distraction,” reaffirming that Crosby remains the heartbeat of the locker room.At 38, Crosby continues to defy age, finishing last season with an impressive 91 points. His leadership, consistency, and drive still set the standard across the league. “I don’t see myself anywhere else,” he said earlier this summer, shutting down rumors — at least for now.Still, the allure of Montreal lingers. Whether Crosby’s commitment holds or the Canadiens’ pursuit intensifies, one thing is certain: the hockey world will be watching every move as Sidney Crosby’s legendary story enters another captivating chapter.Also Read: Sidney Crosby’s secret to staying a top NHL star even at 38 finally explained","Montreal Canadiens linked to Sidney Crosby in major trade buzz.

Showtime Secrets with Norm Nixon | The Byron Scott Trade & The Truth Behind HBO’s Winning Time

Some rivalries are remembered for their scores, while others are known for the drama. The matchups between Larry Bird’s Boston Celtics and Julius Erving’s Philadelphia 76ers were more than just basketball, they were mental showdowns. Larry Bird’s trash talk and fierce competitiveness could rattle even the calmest players. And when Julius Erving finally snapped, it wasn’t just a punch; it was a powerful message. This is the tale of how words and tension crafted one of the NBA ’s most iconic eras.The Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers have been rivals since the 1960s, showcasing legends such as Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain.By the 1980s, Larry Bird was at the helm for the Boston Celtics, while the Philadelphia 76ers boasted Julius Erving, who is famously known as Dr. J.Julius Erving joined the Philadelphia 76ers in 1976 and was crucial in their win against the Boston Celtics in the 1977 Eastern Conference semifinals. The two teams frequently battled in the playoffs, with the high stakes adding to the excitement. Larry Bird, who made his debut in 1979, brought a new level of intensity with his competitive nature and trash-talking abilities.Julius Erving later shared that his animosity towards Larry Bird was rooted in their rivalry: ""I don't care if it's your mother, you're not supposed to get along,"" he mentioned in a 2025 interview, showing the green jersey and Boston's banners as symbols of their opposition.On November 9, 1984, the undefeated Boston Celtics (4-0) took on the Philadelphia 76ers (5-0) at Boston Garden.

You know he was in Doc’s ear.""Norm Nixon shared a personal story from the 1985-86 season against the Los Angeles Clippers, where he played. Larry Bird approached: ""Norm, I’m shooting all three tonight."" Norm Nixon replied, ""Maxwell is going to lock you up,"" referring to Cedric Maxwell. Larry Bird got fouled on his first three-pointer and stared down Norm Nixon.Norm Nixon called Larry Bird ""one of the biggest trash talkers ever,"" noting how such taunts built frustration, leading to Julius Erving's snap.Reports indicate Larry Bird taunted Julius Erving by calling him ""old"" and saying ""get off me"" during the game.

In their next game, they shook hands. The Boston Celtics took home the championship in 1984-85, with Larry Bird snagging the Finals MVP award.The brawl shows Larry Bird's mental advantage, which had an impact on future stars like Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant.

Cowboys rookie Jaydon Blue sidelined after luxury cleats backfire at practice

Fans are calling it a classic ‘rookie mistake’

If Cowboys fans thought Jaydon Blue was about to bring some fire to the Dallas offense, they didn’t expect the fire to come from his feet. The rookie running back, who hasn’t played a single down this season, showed up at practice flexing a pair of Louis Vuitton x Nike cleats. Instead of making a splash, though, he ended up with blisters that had head coach Brian Schottenheimer questioning his priorities. In Dallas, where fans are desperate for wins, the whole thing is being called nothing short of a rookie nightmare.Jaydon Blue decided to break in a flashy new pair of Louis Vuitton-Nike cleats at practice this week. Unfortunately, instead of showcasing his skills, the designer shoes shredded his feet. According to reports, the blisters were bad enough that Schottenheimer labeled the move a “questionable decision.” And when your head coach calls you out before you’ve even earned game time, that’s never a good look.For a rookie still trying to carve a role in the Cowboys’ backfield, this is the last type of headline you want making the rounds.The Cowboys’ fan base didn’t hold back after hearing the news. Many pointed out that Blue hasn’t even touched the field this season, yet he’s already turning practice into a fashion show.To them, it screams more “influencer” than “NFL-ready.”This isn’t OBJ dropping 150 yards in diamond-studded cleats. This is a rookie RB who hasn’t earned a carry yet, sidelined before he could prove anything. Fans are roasting the situation online, calling it both hilarious and frustrating at the same time.The NFL has always had room for players who use fashion to stand out, Odell Beckham Jr. and Cam Newton built entire brands around it. But the difference is, those stars could back up their drip with highlight-reel plays. Jaydon Blue? He hasn’t even logged a snap for Dallas.That’s why this stunt feels less like swagger and more like misplaced priorities. In a league that’s all about grit, blood, and sweat, showing up in Louis Vuitton only to walk away with blisters isn’t exactly the image Cowboys Nation wants to see.Also read - Taylor Swift, Charli XCX feud rumors, and Travis Kelce Easter eggs: here’s what we know","Cowboys rookie Jaydon Blue sidelined after luxury cleats backfire at practice.

Jon Cooper quietly signs contract extension with Tampa Bay Lightning amid speculation

Longevity, success, and what’s next for Tampa Bay

Jon Cooper, the NHL’s longest-tenured head coach, quietly secured a contract extension with the Tampa Bay Lightning over the summer, according to Pierre LeBrun of TSN and The Athletic. The deal, signed without a team announcement, ensures Cooper remains behind the bench past the 2025-26 season. While the exact length of the contract remains unknown, the news ends speculation about his short-term future with the franchise.The extension comes as something of a surprise. Cooper had signed only a one-year deal in May 2024, fueling rumors that he wanted flexibility for a potential move, with connections to Utah ownership sparking whispers of an eventual departure. Instead, Tampa Bay moved decisively to secure his services for the foreseeable future, removing uncertainty heading into the new season.Cooper’s stability provides clarity for the Lightning, who enter the year looking to rebound after three straight first-round playoff exits. While questions lingered about whether his message was wearing thin, the extension is a clear vote of confidence from management in the man who guided the team to two Stanley Cup championships.Now entering his 14th season with the Lightning, Cooper has become an anomaly in a league where coaching turnover is constant. He boasts a career record of 572-306-83 (.638), four conference titles, and two Stanley Cup victories. By the end of this campaign, he will have coached his 1,000th NHL game, ranking fourth all-time for most games with a single franchise.Despite playoff disappointments in recent years, Cooper’s resume remains unmatched among active coaches. His extension signals that Tampa Bay continues to trust his vision, bolstered by a deeper forward group this season and renewed optimism in Florida’s northern market.The Lightning’s decision to quietly lock in Jon Cooper underscores both their confidence in his leadership and his willingness to stay the course in Tampa Bay. While the exact length of the extension remains undisclosed, one thing is clear: Cooper’s remarkable tenure is far from over. For now, he remains the steady hand guiding the Lightning’s pursuit of another championship, silencing speculation about his immediate future.Also Read: Waiver Wire Watch: Key NHL players teams can pick up for free","Jon Cooper, the NHL’s longest-tenured head coach, quietly secured a contract extension with the Tampa Bay Lightning over the summer.

Rising French star Janelle Salaün powers Golden State Valkyries’ historic and versatile season

The WNBA announced recently that Janelle Salaün, a forward for the Golden State Valkyries, was selected to the All-Rookie Team. Salaün is accompanied on the WNBA All-Rookie Team by Seattle's Dominique Malonga, Washington's Sonia Citron and Kiki Iriafen, and Dallas' Paige Bueckers. She was subsequently elected to the WNBA's All-Rookie Team on the basis of her ability and work with the Valkyries.Even though Salaun had played basketball professionally for six years, the 2025 WNBA season was his first season. She is presently playing under a rookie deal of $66,079 for one year, according to Spotrac.The 2025 WNBA season is the only time the same will be in effect. Salaun will then be eligible to sign as a Restricted Free Agent. Additionally, there is a $66,079 cap impact on the contract. Janelle Salaun got a minimum salary of $66,079 for the 2025 season of the WNBA, as per the agreement.Salaun is also praised for all she did for the Valkyries . Valkyries head coach Natalie Nakase talked about Janelle Salaun back in August and said:“[Janelle] is versatile, Just having that versatility to go against any type of defender. I think that’s key.. Janelle had an exceptional rookie season, and this recognition is well-deserved.”She continued:“She's one of the most driven and focused players I've coached. Her mindset is 100% on the game - how she can get better and help this team win. She stepped up all season and showed a maturity which is really impressive for someone in their first year in the WNBA.”According to reports, Janelle Salaun began playing basketball when she was 12 years old.

Among them was Janelle Salaün, who was announced on Monday as a member of the 2025 WNBA All-Rookie team.During the French National Team's silver medal finish in the Olympic Games in Paris last year, Salaün was a member of the squad. She was a starter during the French team's Olympic run and is an important member of the team.This year's free agency saw other WNBA teams interested in signing Salaün besides the Valkyries. She has offensive talent and is a very flexible two-way player. As a proficient 3-point shooter, she aligns perfectly with Natalie Nakase's strategy for the Valkyries, which prioritizes shooting and defence.Also read: What is Walker Kessler's net worth?
