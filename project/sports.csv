Bengals Say Goodbye to Trey Hendrickson Despite His Dominant Season

the

$15M Investment Signals Shift from Defense to Offense

Fans React to the Bengals' Game-Changing Strategy

The Cincinnati Bengals just made a move that has fans scratching their heads — parting ways with their defensive powerhouse Trey Hendrickson and splashing $15 million on a new star, all in the name of protecting Joe Burrow . It’s a bold shift, trading sack stats for quarterback security, and it's got everyone talking.Trey Hendrickson wasn’t just a key part of the Bengals' defense — he wasguy. A relentless pass-rusher, Hendrickson led the league in sacks last season, proving his value week in and week out. His ability to disrupt offenses made him a cornerstone of Cincinnati’s defense. Even when trade rumors started swirling about his future with the team, a prominent quarterback stepped up and publicly backed him, adding weight to the belief that Hendrickson wasn’t going anywhere — or so it seemed.But now? In a stunning turn of events, Hendrickson is out, leaving fans and analysts alike shocked. The Bengals have pivoted in an unexpected direction, signaling a bold shift in their defensive strategy.In place of Hendrickson, the Bengals have invested $15 million in a new player, not to bolster their defense but to fortify the offensive line. The clear motive? Keep Joe Burrow upright.After seasons marred by injuries and constant pressure, it seems Cincinnati is done taking risks with their franchise QB’s health. This isn’t just a trade — it’s a statement. They’re prioritizing Burrow’s protection over defensive dominance.The move has sparked debate among fans and analysts alike. While some understand the logic — a healthy Burrow is essential for playoff dreams — others question the cost of letting a sack leader walk away.Hendrickson’s absence will surely leave a gap in the Bengals’ defense, but the team seems confident that bolstering the offensive line will pay off in the long run.This roster shakeup marks more than just a swap — it’s a recalibration of the Bengals' identity. Defense wins games, but a protected Joe Burrow wins championships. The franchise seems to be betting that keeping their star quarterback safe is the key to long-term success.Now, all eyes are on the 2025 season. Will this gamble pay off, or will the Bengals regret trading sacks for security?What’s your take — did the Bengals make the right move to put Burrow’s health above all else?Also read - Fans Rally Behind Tua Tagovailoa After 'Dad Bod' Yacht Photos Go Viral — 'Let the Man Relax",The Cincinnati Bengals have traded defensive powerhouse Trey Hendrickson.

Paul Goldschmidt with Meredith Marakovits

""I loved it there. I’ve got nothing bad to say about the organization—the fans were amazing, everything was great. We had high expectations, just like we do here in New York. We wanted to win a World Series, and we didn’t do it, so that will always stick with me as a disappointment. But so many great memories and just a great time overall.""

Details into Paul Goldschmidt's impressive MLB career

It has been more than a decade since Paul Goldschmidt played in the league. Over his career, Goldschmidt has played with three teams. Currently signed with the New York Yankees , Goldschmidt was previously playing with the St. Louis Cardinals for six long seasons. Goldschmidt does not have many complaints about his time at the Cardinals, but just one.On Sunday, Paul Goldschmidt got the chance to be face-to-face with his former team, the St. Louis Cardinals, who ended up winning the Spring Training game against the New York Yankees by 6-5. Before the Yankees vs Cardinals clash, Goldschmidt was interviewed by YES Network.During one of the segments of the interview, Paul Goldschmidt recapped his time playing for the Cardinals.

Talking about it in detail, Goldschmidt said:Paul Goldschmidt started his MLB career with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2009 when the team signed him for $95,000. In 2011, the Diamondbacks and Goldschmidt agreed upon a pre-arbitration agreement worth $414,000, followed by another pre-arbitration deal in 2012 worth $452,000.In 2013, Goldschmidt signed one more pre-arbitration deal with the Diamondbacks worth $500,000, followed by an extension worth $52 Million for 5 years.

Jimmy Butler and Steve Kerr Exchange Heated Words After Controversial Late-Game Shot in Warriors' Win Over Portland Trail Blazers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/jimmy-butler-and-steve-kerr-exchange-heated-words-after-controversial-late-game-shot-in-warriors-win-over-portland-trail-blazers/articleshow/118941015.cms,"Image Via Getty

Steve Kerr Explains Why He Told Jimmy Butler to Break NBA’s Unwritten Rule

Jimmy Butler’s Triple-Double Overshadowed by Controversial Shot

Jimmy Butler single handedly forces a shot clock violation

Gary Payton II Scores Career-High 26 Points to Lead Golden State Warriors to Victory

What should have been a straightforward win for the Warriors turned into a mess after the game. Jimmy Butler 's triple-double was overshadowed by a last-second shot that really upset the Portland Trail Blazers players — and it looked like it got under Butler's skin too. A video from after the game showed a tense moment between him and coach Steve Kerr , who later revealed he was the one who told Butler to take that shot. Here’s the whole story behind that unexpected twist.As the clock wound down in the Warriors' 130-120 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, Jimmy Butler was in a bit of a bind. With Golden State comfortably ahead and only a few ticks left, he had to choose between holding the ball or taking a shot. Usually, teams would just let the clock run out in these moments. But after a quick glance at Steve Kerr on the sideline, Butler decided to take an open jumper, which ruffled a few feathers among the Trail Blazers players.Footage from after the game showed Jimmy Butler frustrated during a brief but intense talk with Steve Kerr. Kerr later explained his reasoning, saying, “I told him, we don't do shot clock violations. If there’s a shot clock differential, we always shoot.” Kerr’s firm stance on this philosophy put Butler in a tricky situation, even though he seemed a little reluctant on the court.Butler had a standout performance that evening! He scored 15 points, pulled down 10 rebounds, and tallied 10 assists, marking his second triple-double this season and his first as a Warrior. His previous triple-double was on December 16 while he was with the Miami Heat. The Warriors are sitting pretty with a 12-1 record when Butler plays, highlighting his significant role in their success.While all this is happening, Stephen Curry keeps shining this season, hitting five 3-pointers and bringing his total to 251. This is his 11th season with 250+ threes, which is an NBA record. He’s just two 3-pointers away from being the first player to hit 4,000 career triples.Even with the fuss going on, the Warriors' depth was a key factor in their victory. Gary Payton II had an impressive night, scoring a career-high 26 points and tying his record with four 3-pointers. Buddy Hield also made his mark with six 3-pointers and 20 points, showing off the Warriors' strong offensive lineup.The arguments between Jimmy Butler and Steve Kerr after the game definitely caught some attention, but it doesn't take away from how well the Warriors played. With Stephen Curry on the verge of hitting a major milestone and Butler stepping up with his all-around skills, Golden State is proving they're a force to be reckoned with.Also Read - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander vs Nikola Jokic: Who Truly Deserves the 2025 NBA MVP?

Superstar Roman Reigns made headlines when he returned to WWE on the March 10 episode of Monday Night RAW. The OTC joined the steel cage match between Seth ""Freakin"" Rollins and CM Punk held in the Madison Square Garden in New York.Reigns took everyone by surprise when he entered during the feud. During the steel cage match, Reigns joined Seth Rollins and CM Punk and attacked them both. The OTC then pulled out Rollins of the steel cage and continued attacking. Later, he went on to attack CM Punk, who was joined by his friend Paul Heyman, with a vicious spear, ultimately gifting Rollins the win.This action led everyone to wonder why the OTC did not join his cousin Jey Uso who locked horns with Grayson Waller in the singles match and then later attacked by Austin Theory and Gunther. Let's find out the possible reason for his decision to not join and help Jey Uso, but his arch-rival Seth Rollins.During the main event, Roman Reigns made a comeback after his hiatus after the Royal Rumble 2025. The OTC entered the RAW to intervene in the steel cage match between Seth Rollins and CM Punk.The Tribal Chief came back with vengeance in his mind, after Rollins had previously taken him out with two stomps at the Royal Rumble match. This incident added speculation that the company is possibly planning a triple-threat match between Reigns, Seth Rollins, and CM Punk at the upcoming WrestleMania 41 Meanwhile, Jey Uso, who happens to be Reigns' cousin, also participated in the same event. During the WWE RAW match, Jey Uso locked horns with Grayson Waller. Though Uso won the match against Waller, the feud did not end there. He was subsequently attacked by Austin Theory and Gunther.Similarly, fans are wondering why Reigns did not join the bandwagon to help Jey Uso from Gunther and Theory, given the fact that the Tribal Chief has resolved all issues with Jey Uso.The possible reason behind it may be the company's decision to not make a crossover between them. It could have happened that the OTC did not reach the venue and had different timelines in their appearance.Besides, the Triple-H creative team has something different in their plan about the upcoming triple-threat match. Had Reigns joined Jey Uso during the feud, the storyline development about the triple-threat match would have been different from what has been decided by the WWE management.",Roman Reigns returned to WWE on the March 10 episode of Monday Night RAW.

Brenda Song praises Linda Rambis as a hero while Jeanie Buss reflects on the Lakers' bold Luka Doncic trade

Jeanie Buss, the owner of the Los Angeles Lakers , recently collaborated with Netflix to create a comedy series titled ""Running Point,"" which offers a fictionalized portrayal of her journey as an NBA team owner. The show features actress Kate Hudson in the role of Isla Gordon, a character inspired by Buss.According to actress Brenda Song, who stars in the series, Buss approached Mindy Kaling, creator of ""The Office,"" about five years ago with the idea. Buss, known for her sense of humor, preferred a comedic take on her experiences, believing her life was so extraordinary that it lent itself to comedy.The first season of ""Running Point"" has been well-received, earning a 7.5 rating on IMDb and a 78% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Song also mentioned that her character is loosely based on Lakers' executive Linda Rambis, whom she admires greatly.In real life, Buss recently made headlines with a significant move for the Lakers: the acquisition of NBA superstar Luka Doncic from the Dallas Mavericks . This blockbuster trade sent shockwaves through the basketball community, as it involved exchanging Doncic for Anthony Davis, a key player in the Lakers' 2020 championship win.""I knew this trade would be big in the NBA, but I didn’t fully realize just how globally popular Luka Doncic is,"" Buss admitted.""While we’re excited to have him on the Lakers, parting ways with Anthony Davis was not easy. We weren’t actively looking to trade him it was actually the Mavericks who initiated the discussions. In the end, it was a tough decision, but one that ultimately made sense for both teams.Doncic, who had been with the Mavericks since joining the NBA, was reportedly shocked by the trade. He had envisioned spending his entire career in Dallas and expressed his surprise and sadness in a letter to Mavericks fans. He thanked them for their unwavering support and acknowledged the difficulty of the sudden change.The trade also had significant implications for the Mavericks. Anthony Davis, who joined Dallas as part of the exchange, faced challenges early on, including injuries that limited his ability to contribute immediately.Also read: Ben Affleck’s 'Air' Captured Michael Jordan's Legacy Without Featuring the NBA Legend On-Screen Jeanie Buss is excited about Luka Doncic joining the Lakers.

Mike Williams reunites with Chargers on a one-year deal to strengthen wide receiver lineup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/mike-williams-reunites-with-chargers-on-a-one-year-deal-to-strengthen-wide-receiver-lineup/articleshow/118956646.cms,"Credit: Getty Images

Mike Williams Makes a Comeback to the Chargers on a One-Year Deal



Mike Williams is set to make a return to the Los Angeles Chargers after spending just one season away from the team. According to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero, Williams has agreed to a one-year contract worth up to $6 million. This reunion marks a significant moment for both Williams and the Chargers, as the team looks to strengthen its offense after a challenging season.The Chargers originally selected Williams with the seventh overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. He spent his first seven seasons with the team, establishing himself as a reliable target for the Chargers' offense. However, Williams left Los Angeles last offseason, signing with the New York Jets in a move that was expected to elevate his career alongside Aaron Rodgers. Unfortunately, that plan unraveled quickly when Rodgers suffered a season-ending injury. Williams was then traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers in November, where he finished the 2024 season.Williams struggled to make a significant impact during his time with the Jets and Steelers. Over 18 games last season, he managed just 21 receptions for 298 yards and one touchdown. Interestingly, that lone touchdown came during his debut with the Steelers — a game-winning catch that briefly hinted at the playmaking ability he had displayed with the Chargers in previous years.Williams's last full season with the Chargers in 2023 was cut short after he suffered a torn ACL in Week 3, forcing him to miss the rest of the season. However, his contributions to the Chargers' offense before the injury were undeniable. He led the team in receiving yards during both the 2021 (1,146 yards) and 2022 (895 yards) seasons, showcasing his ability to be a dominant downfield threat.The Chargers' decision to bring Williams back reflects their urgent need for experienced pass catchers to support quarterback Justin Herbert. The team's receiving corps faced significant setbacks last season, prompting new general manager Joe Hortiz to make adjustments. Williams’s return offers Herbert a familiar and reliable target, which could help stabilize the offense. Despite his struggles last season, Williams remains a physical receiver who can use his size to make contested catches — a skill set that could be valuable in the red zone and on critical third downs.While Williams’s stock may have dipped following his disappointing stint with the Jets and Steelers, a return to a familiar system with Herbert under center could be exactly what he needs to rejuvenate his career. Ladd McConkey is expected to lead the receiving unit, but Williams will likely compete with Quentin Johnson for snaps. With the Chargers also expected to add more weapons through the 2025 NFL Draft, Williams will have to prove he still has enough left in the tank to earn consistent playing time.Also Read: “Trade them and move on”: Former NFL star Robert Griffin III criticizes Cowboys' handling of Micah Parsons' contract negotiations Williams's return to the Chargers feels like a last chance to prove he can still be a difference-maker. If he can stay healthy and regain his form, he could provide a much-needed spark for the Chargers’ offense. His familiarity with Herbert and the offensive system gives him a strong foundation to bounce back and potentially make this comeback season one to remember.","Mike Williams has agreed to a one-year contract with the Los Angeles Chargers, according to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.

Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen have moved on with their lives following their high-profile divorce in 2022. After 13 years of marriage, the former couple has gracefully adapted to their new realities, finding success and fulfillment in both their personal and professional lives. While Brady continues to thrive in the football world post-retirement, Bündchen has rediscovered her passion for modeling and found love again with her jiu-jitsu instructor, Joaquim Valente .Tom Brady’s love for football remains as intense as ever, even after retiring from the NFL . Since stepping away from the game, he has found success in his new role as Fox’s lead analyst. His insightful commentary and high-profile interviews, including a notable one with Patrick Mahomes, contributed to Fox's record-breaking 127.7 million viewers during the 2025 Super Bowl . Despite his busy schedule, Brady has maintained a balance between his professional commitments and fatherhood, ensuring that his children—Benjamin, Vivian, and Jack—remain a priority.Brady’s unwavering connection to football was highlighted when he shared an Instagram story showing him throwing a football with the caption, “true love.” This subtle yet powerful statement reflects that his passion for the game remains unchanged. Speaking on The Pivot Podcast in May 2024, Brady admitted that his motivation was never about winning titles but rather about the sheer joy of the game. “It was never to be a champion. I love just throwing the football. When I throw the football and I see that ball spiral out of my hands, I’m like, ‘Woo! Love that! You guys want to go to the beach? Let’s throw the football. I’ll have a hell of a time. We would laugh, we would probably play for three hours out there,’” Brady shared, underscoring how football remains a fundamental part of his identity.Gisele Bündchen has also moved forward gracefully. The supermodel, who once described her divorce as “the death of her dream,” resumed her modeling career in March 2023 after a six-month break. In February 2024, a source close to Bündchen confirmed her relationship with her jiu-jitsu instructor, Joaquim Valente, to Page Six. The couple has been spotted vacationing together in Costa Rica, often accompanied by their daughter, Vivian, reflecting a harmonious and supportive family dynamic.Bündchen has openly spoken about the emotional challenges following her split from Brady. In a 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, she reflected on the complexities of their relationship, stating, “When I was 26 years old and he was 29, we met, we wanted a family, we wanted things together. As time goes by, we realize that we just wanted different things, and now we have a choice to make. That doesn’t mean you don’t love the person.” Bündchen’s candid acknowledgment highlights the mutual respect that remains between them despite their separation.Motherhood continues to be central to Bündchen’s life. She recently welcomed a baby with Valente, though the details have been kept private. To relax during her postpartum period, Bündchen was spotted enjoying a yacht trip in Miami with Valente in March 2025. Her recent comments about feeling “like she lived in Tom [Brady’s] shadow for a long time” suggest that she has now reclaimed her independence and sense of self. Bündchen has also embraced a more balanced lifestyle, focusing on self-care and mindfulness.While Brady and Bündchen have taken different paths, they remain committed to co-parenting their children with mutual respect. Brady’s acknowledgment of Bündchen in his Mother’s Day Instagram story in May 2024 reflects the amicable nature of their post-divorce relationship. Despite their romantic separation, both have prioritized maintaining a stable and loving environment for their children.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen enjoys newfound ‘freedom’ with Joaquim Valente after years in Tom Brady’s 'Shadow': Report Their ability to find happiness and fulfillment independently while maintaining a respectful relationship post-divorce serves show their maturity and shared values.

Patrick Mahomes’ Mom Randi Hints at Major Project



Randi Mahomes , the mother of Kansas City Chiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes , has once again stirred excitement among fans with a mysterious yet thrilling announcement. Recently, Randi hinted at a “big” project in the works, and now, she has provided an exciting update that has left Chiefs Kingdom buzzing with anticipation. Despite grappling with the emotional aftermath of her father’s sudden passing, Randi has channeled her resilience into something positive—a new endeavor that promises to be inspiring and impactful.Taking to her official Instagram account, Randi shared a sneak peek of her upcoming project, giving fans a glimpse of what’s to come. Rooted in her Texas heritage, the mom of three revealed that she had been working on this exciting project while visiting Dallas. In her Instagram caption, Randi teased, “Something special is in the works!❤️ I was in Dallas recently filming for a project I can’t wait to share with y’all. If you missed the behind-the-scenes on my stories, here’s a little sneak peek.”What makes this project even more intriguing is the involvement of two well-known figures—motivational speaker and peak performance coach Kirsten Jones and psychologist and author Elizabeth Lombardo. Randi’s post included behind-the-scenes photos with Jones and Lombardo, suggesting that the project could revolve around mental strength, motivation, or perhaps even parenting in the world of sports. The chemistry between Randi and her collaborators was evident, adding to the growing excitement surrounding the project’s nature.Adding more fuel to the speculation, Randi’s post also included a special message directed at fellow sports parents. “To all my fellow sports parents: stay tuned—exciting things coming soon!” she added, suggesting that the project might cater to parents navigating the challenges of raising young athletes. This detail has led to widespread guesses—could it be a book on sports parenting, a motivational series, or even a reality show? The mystery surrounding the project has only heightened the anticipation among her followers.One particular image from the post gained significant attention—Randi looked stunning in a vibrant red outfit during what appeared to be a sit-down interview with Jones in Dallas. The confidence and warmth reflected in her demeanor hinted at the personal significance of this project. Much like her son’s ability to foster team chemistry on the field, Randi seemed to have created a strong connection with her collaborators, further elevating expectations for the upcoming launch.Randi had initially dropped hints about this project on March 3, when she posted a cryptic message on her Instagram story: “In Dallas, Texas… shooting for something BIG. Launching soon.” She later reinforced this excitement on her X handle, writing, “Can’t wait to share something Big!!” This growing buzz has left fans speculating and eagerly awaiting further details.Also Read: ""Sign with ’em"": Brett Favre makes his stance on Aaron Rodgers’ potential Vikings move crystal clear While the nature of the project remains under wraps, one thing is clear—Randi Mahomes’ latest venture promises to be as captivating and influential as her family’s legacy on the football field.","Randi Mahomes, the mother of Kansas City Chiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes has once again stirred excitement among fans with a mysterious yet thrilling announcement.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan cricket has once again found itself in the middle of controversy and chaos following its first-round exit from the Champions Trophy 2025 — a tournament they were hosting on home soil after 29 years.The disappointment has not only triggered fan outrage but also exposed deep divisions among past and present coaching figures. Mickey Arthur , who led Pakistan during one of their more successful white-ball phases, was brutally honest in his criticism. Speaking to talkSport, Arthur said, “I love this quote, to be brutally honest. Jason Gillespie is a wonderful coach, wonderful man. Pakistan cricket just continues to shoot itself in the foot. It is its worst enemy.”Arthur believes Pakistan had made the right moves by appointing Jason Gillespie and Gary Kirsten to helm the red-ball and white-ball squads, respectively.However, he expressed regret at the ongoing instability that continues to plague the system. “There are so many good players; they’ve got the resources now; there's so much young talent. They have incredible skill. And yet, it's still so chaotic. It's really disappointing to see.”In a sharp rebuttal to Aaqib Javed’s comments blaming Pakistan’s recent struggles on “too many changes”, Gillespie accused the newly appointed coach of trying to “undermine them” and even called Javed a “clown.”Arthur echoed those concerns, pointing to deeper issues in Pakistan’s cricketing structure. “They had got some really good coaches who could take them forward. But then that machine that works in Pakistan just keeps undermining, and agendas are driven in the media,” he said.ALSO SEE: Jason Gillespie calls Pakistan's Aaqib Javed a 'clown' “It's a jungle out there and I feel desperately sorry for Gary and Jason.

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal has stirred controversy with his blunt remarks regarding the absence of a representative from host nation Pakistan during the prize distribution ceremony of the recently concluded ICC Champions Trophy Akmal asserted that Pakistan did not ""deserve"" to have a representative on stage, citing the team's poor performance and lack of respect on the international stage.""The ICC showed us the mirror,"" Akmal said on his YouTube channel. ""The tournament's director (Sumair) was there. He was available, and why wasn't he in the ceremony? It is because we don't deserve to be there. We are not playing good cricket. Minow teams have shown us the mirror.""He further expressed his disappointment with the current state of Pakistan cricket, adding, ""No one discussed how Pakistan hosted the tournament. If we play such cricket, we will be treated like this. If you play for yourself, there will be no respect.""The controversy erupted when Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief executive and Champions Trophy tournament director Sumair Ahmad Syed, who was present at the venue in Dubai, was not invited on stage for the final presentation.

Former Pakistan all-rounder Imad Wasim has lashed out at the national cricket team's outdated playing style following their disappointing performance in the recently concluded ICC Champions Trophy . As hosts, Pakistan finished last in Group A after a winless campaign, suffering heavy defeats to finalists New Zealand and eventual champions India. Their only point came from a washed-out match against Bangladesh, but they still finished below Bangladesh due to an inferior net run rate.Imad, who retired from international cricket, expressed his frustration in a video clip shared by an X user, admitting that he often feels reluctant to watch Pakistan play. ""So you got to play cricket. Cricket, like it should be played. This is not the right way for me, if you ask me as a cricketer — not even as a Pakistani, just as a cricketer. I watch some of the games the Pakistan team play, and I feel I just don't want to watch it, but I have to watch it. Eventually, people will lose interest, and they won't come to watch cricket if we keep playing like this,"" he said.The former all-rounder criticised Pakistan's cautious and outdated approach, pointing out that modern cricket requires a more aggressive and proactive mindset. He argued that teams like England and Australia have set a new standard that Pakistan has failed to follow.""So you see England, Australia — or cricket I can understand — the solution I'm telling you I can understand. Your first instinct should be to go out there and attack the opposition. And if you lose wickets, then you assess the conditions — okay, this is a 250, 260, 300 wicket — whatever. But your first instinct should just be to go out there and attack, not to think, ‘Let's score 250.' We are way behind where the world is,"" Imad said.Reflecting on his earlier warnings that were ignored, Imad revealed that his calls for change were often met with ridicule. ""Well, I've been saying this for years, and people were laughing at me. Firstly, when I started saying these things, even in the team meetings, I used to say these things. The world is going on a different path, and we are playing the same way,"" he lamented.Imad's harsh critique echoes the sentiments of frustrated fans and cricket experts who believe Pakistan's reluctance to modernise their style is holding them back on the global stage. Despite being tournament hosts, Pakistan's performance drew heavy criticism, and many are calling for a complete overhaul of their cricketing approach to keep pace with the evolving demands of international cricket.","Former Pakistan all-rounder Imad Wasim has lashed out at the national cricket team's outdated playing style.

So that way I'm fortunate that they're very close to her, and she gets all the attention which is needed.""Humpy, two-time World Rapid Champion, became a chess Grandmaster in 2002 at the age of 15.At that time, she was the youngest woman to achieve the title, making him no stranger to medals or media glare — the most recent one after she was made the brand ambassador for the SOG Grandmaster Series.Life runs at a rapid pace when you are winning, in general. For Humpy, 2014 marked the start of a new journey — her marriage with Anvesh Dasari . A few years later, they were blessed with a baby girl, Ahana.Her commitment toward her child and family kept her away from the game for some time.""I still remember when I won the 2019 World Rapid Championship, I hadn't been playing for nearly one and a half years,"" Humpy says. ""I took a break in 2017 and started playing again around November or December 2018. When I came back to chess, practice and preparation were there, but I had become a much tougher person. You know, raising a child meant sleepless nights. I learned I'm even capable of doing the work without having a proper food. Earlier, that wasn't the case — if something went wrong, it would immediately affect my performance. But motherhood helped me adjust to all of that and made me mentally tougher.""Motherhood, for Humpy, was never a distraction as she continues to wear it not like a weight, but like armor.""I always feel motherhood is a strength. It cannot make you sidestep your profession,"" she accepts with a grin.As a child prodigy from Vijayawada, a small city in Andhra Pradesh, Humpy didn't have grand academies or training partners on call.What she had was a father looking after his child.Back then, it was Humpy's father who would help a budding chess star — someone who rarely showed interest in poring over dense books filled with opening theories or classic moves — as she prepared for upcoming tournaments.""I'm not a book reader at all. I'd love to read on a laptop or a tab, but not in books,"" she laughs. ""During my childhood, my dad used to do all the preparation — he would get those books, have them copied, and make separate bindings with the lines to play and all that. I was never into that kind of work. It was only after 2012 that I started preparing on my own. But by then, we were already used to laptops and software.""In a society that often romanticises maternal sacrifice into silence, here is a mother, who continues to redefine ambition, by not choosing between motherhood and mastery.As for her daughter, there is no checkmate path mapped out.""I never want to pressurise her,"" Humpy tells. ""For me, it's about letting her do what she enjoys, whatever profession she wants to pursue — it's fine. I just want her to grow up as a positive person. That's more important to me than which profession she chooses.""In a country now experiencing a chess renaissance, Koneru Humpy remains an epitome of calmness. ""As for staying calm under pressure, I think it comes naturally to me. Even as a child, I was like that. People often say they couldn't tell whether I won or lost a game because I always maintained the same calm,"" she adds.Behind her calm demeanour lies a strict routine: ""sleep early, wake up early, and that helps me stay composed and well-prepared"".""During tournaments, I prefer going for walks to get fresh air since we spend most of our time indoors. When I'm at home, I make sure to go to the gym every day to maintain physical fitness. Yoga is great, of course, but I personally enjoy more physical activity, especially because we sit for long hours while playing,"" she continues.The 37-year-old GM readies her bid for the Women's Grand Prix in Pune (April 13-24), Norway Chess (May 26-June 6), then the World Cup (July 5-29) in Georgia.""I think I definitely need to change my strategy for the World Cup because it's a knockout tournament. But I'll focus on that after I complete these two classical events—Norway Chess and the Grand Prix. Probably after Norway, I'll start preparing specifically for the knockout format. Yes, I need to do something different for that,"" says a mother on a mission.In a world with kids learning the Sicilian Defence before the alphabet, Koneru Humpy comes across as a pillar, a mother who seems reluctant to make motherhood her excuse.",Koneru Humpy is India's top-ranked woman in chess. The 37-year-old is a two-time World Rapid Champion. Humpy became a chess Grandmaster in 2002 at the age of 15. She is the brand ambassador for the SOG Grandmaster Series.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118883722,imgsize-130542,width-400,resizemode-4/118883722.jpg"

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times— for the? Not really. The Dallas Mavericks were at the receiving end of the trouble following the Luka Doncic trade in exchange for Anthony Davis . However, for the Lakers, letting Davis go was not an easy decision. In a recent interview, the Lakers' boss,, candidly shared how hard it was for them to let go of the 10-time NBA All-Star while revealing why the secret of the trade was the utmost necessity.The Anthony Davis Luka Doncic trade was a shockwave that no one in the league, even the insiders, saw coming. Of course, it still echoes debate among fans, especially concerning the Dallas Mavericks gamble, but the Lakers were not entirely out of regret. The Lakers president and governor Jeanie Buss has recently shared her thoughts on the whole ordeal.""I said what's the most important is that if the conversations [about the trade] become public, it could blow up our season. Because now you have a player who thinks they're gonna get traded, it's hard for them to recalibrate. It was completely kept under wraps, and I think that's why it took everybody by such surprise."" Buss said.Explaining the expense of the trade, Buss continued, ""Look what we had to give up, though. Anthony Davis, we won a championship [with him]. Do you know how hard that was? We were not looking to trade Anthony Davis. Dallas contacted us. And [Davis] had been making it clear that he wasn't happy, that he was having to play the [center]. He wanted to play the [power forward].""But at the end of the day, it was all business and keeping the roster packed with star performers. Certainly, Doncic came with certain perks, including his age factor. Bringing Doncic proved to be a huge win for the Lakers, as they have had a good series of matches since the arrival of the 26-year-old Slovenian star.""I think we need to get the right players around him,"" Buss said of Doncic. ""It's very interesting to watch him play with LeBron. We don't have enough of a sample size yet. Wow, this kid can pass the ball. He sees the game like no one I've ever [seen]. I really had no idea how great of a mind he has for basketball.""She added, ""The timeline started — just because you'll never forget that day — on Jan. 7. The Lakers were in Dallas. At that point, our GM, Rob Pelinka, was at the game, and he met with the GM of the Dallas team. And then, Rob thought about it for a day and then came to me and said, 'Here's something that was kind of talked about.' A framework. And I said, 'I hope you told him that we're not trading Anthony Davis.' We are not trading him. Then we talked more and more, [and] we figured out a framework that could work.""Also Read: Anthony Davis Struggles with Sudden Trade, Injury Woes and Adjusting to a New Team Without His Family It appears that both teams got what they wanted.

When and where to watch Tatum and the Celtics play tonight against the Thunder (March 12, 2025)?

The Boston Celtics face a potential setback as star forward Jayson Tatum is listed as questionable for their highly anticipated matchup against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, March 12, at TD Garden. Tatum, who has been a cornerstone of the Celtics’ success this season, is dealing with a knee issue that could sideline him for the game. Jayson Tatum ’s absence would be a significant blow to the Boston Celtics, who are already navigating injuries to key players. Al Horford (toe) and Kristaps Porzingis (illness) are both day-to-day, while Jaylen Brown (knee) is probable. Tatum’s contributions have been vital this season, as he leads the team with 27.2 points per game, ranking fourth in the NBA.

Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the NBA’s leading scorer with 32.7 points per game, poses a significant challenge for Boston’s defense. The Thunder also have injury concerns, with Jalen Williams (hip) listed as day-to-day, while Nikola Topic (ACL) and Ajay Mitchell (toe) are out.Boston’s offense, which averages 116.9 points per game (seventh in the league), relies heavily on Jayson Tatum’s scoring and playmaking. His 8.9 rebounds per game also lead the team, highlighting his all-around impact. If Tatum is unable to play, the Boston Celtics will need Jaylen Brown and Derrick White to step up. Brown has been solid recently, averaging 19.1 points over the last 20 games, while White has contributed 17.5 points and 4.8 assists during the same stretch.The game, scheduled for 7:30 p.m. ET, will be broadcast on ESPN, NBCS-BOS, and FDSOK, with live streaming available on Fubo. Fans are eagerly awaiting updates on Tatum’s status, as his presence could be the deciding factor in this clash between two of the NBA’s top teams.Also read: Will LaMelo Ball play tonight against the Atlanta Hawks?

Sidney Crosby joins Alex Ovechkin to surpass Wayne Gretzky's legendary record

Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin are both attempting to surpass Wayne Gretzky 's legendary record of 19 consecutive seasons with a point-per-game average. With 19 seasons, Crosby needs just 10 points in the Penguin's final 15 games to overtake the Great One.In a dramatic race to re-write NHL history, Sidney Crosby is on the verge of one of Wayne Gretzky's longest-standing records. The captain of the Pittsburgh Penguins is within striking distance of Gretzky's record of 19 straight seasons averaging at least a point per game. Having already equaled the mark with 19 such seasons himself, Crosby has only 10 points in the Penguins' final 15 games to be alone in the record books.Over the course of his storied career, Crosby has tallied 1,666 regular-season points and 201 in the playoffs. His three Stanley Cup titles and unquestioned leadership have him among hockey's all-time greats.His arch-nemesis, longtime rival Alex Ovechkin, meanwhile, keeps chasing another Gretzky record—the all-time goal mark. With 886 goals in his career, Ovechkin is nine shy of reaching Gretzky's iconic total of 894.Crosby and Ovechkin have been entwined ever since they were drafted first overall in back-to-back years, fueling one of hockey's most storied rivalries. Their on-ice success reignited NHL interest during a time of waning viewership, establishing them as two of the most impactful players of their era. Today, as they pursue history together, their legacies are soaring to new heights.As the season progresses, NHL fans across the board are watching very closely as Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin move further towards making history. Crosby is up to 70 points playing 65 games, while Ovechkin, who did miss time from a fibula fracture, accumulated 53 points on 49 games, of which 33 were goals.Also Read: “Hardest record to break”: Wayne Gretzky reveals his favorite all-time NHL record and why he considers it unbreakable With every game, tension mounts as these two icons continue to drive towards thresholds that were previously thought to be beyond reach.

Why Rishabh Pant needs a good IPL,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/why-rishabh-pant-needs-a-good-ipl/articleshow/118958698.cms,"DIFFERENT ROLES: Rishabh Pant will be turning out for a new IPL franchise this season as captain of the Lucknow Super Giants, but his limited-overs career for India has largely stagnated. (BCCI Photo)

He was the most expensive player at the auction but in India colours, didn't even get a game in the Champions Trophy. This season of the T20 league could determine the 'keeper-batter's future limited-overs prospects

Indian cricket will get into IPL mode soon and most of the talk will revolve around comparing price tags and performances. One man who is certain to be at the centre of it all is Rishabh Pant , currently the most expensive player in the history of IPL after Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) bid Rs 27 crore for him in the mega auction.Interestingly, both Pant and the second most expensive player, Shreyas Iyer (Rs 26.75 crore), are case studies in how IPL auction dynamics don't necessarily determine a player's international career. Iyer, despite winning an IPL trophy as captain of Kolkata Knight Riders last year, doesn't earn a spot in India's T20I team, while Pant is second-choice wicketkeeper in ODIs. There's tough competition for a T20I spot too.Pant has forever been celebrated as the X-factor in Indian cricket. Yet, his white-ball career has struggled to take off. KL Rahul was first-choice wicketkeeper in the recent ICC Champions Trophy . Sanju Samson has shown evidence of his potential in the T20I format. Pant, meanwhile, had a gruelling Test season.Chief national selector Ajit Agarkar had, before the Champions Trophy, indicated that Pant was the first-choice wicketkeeper but coach Gautam Gambhir said Pant must wait for his opportunity.In such a scenario, this IPL is one of the most delicate phases in Pant's career. Having become the captain of a new franchise, there will be different pressures and challenges. Former India selector Devang Gandhi feels Pant must forget the tag of being the most expensive IPL player. ""Had he been retained by Delhi Capitals , he would not have been the most expensive player. This IPL is about putting his head down and giving himself the best chance to score a lot of runs,"" Gandhi told TOI.Pant has himself stated that his aim will always be to play for India and his endeavour is not let IPL become a distraction. ""I never even thought about playing in the IPL. I think today, people are more focused on the IPL. I believe that if your goal is to play for your country, everything else will eventually fall into place,"" Pant told IPL broadcasters.Former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta said, ""When it comes to India's white-ball cricket, things are still fluid. Rahul has strengthened his place in the ODI XI, but I don't think Pant is too far off going by the sessions I have observed. Credit to Rahul that he managed to stay ahead of a player of Pant's calibre.""""The good thing about Gambhir is that he loves to give players a fair run and prefers continuity. Rahul did well when Pant was injured. But I do believe Gambhir will not let Pant go without giving a decent hit either,"" Gandhi said. One may argue that Pant's inconsistency in white-ball cricket stems from a lack of clarity about his role.In 2022, before Pant had that near fatal accident, India used him at No. 4 in ODIs. He won the team a series in England with an unbeaten century. Head coach Rahul Dravid subsequently granted him an opening spot in T20Is immediately after the T20 WC in 2022 before using him at No. 3 in the 2024 T20 WC.Going forward, there is a T20 World Cup early next year, followed by an ODI World Cup in late 2027. ""Selectors think he is indispensable in Test cricket. That's why he doesn't get a decent run in white-ball formats because they need to preserve him,"" Gandhi said. ""Probably this year he should be given more game time in T20s than ODIs."".Gandhi reckons Pant's strength lies in batting more overs and that should be his thinking in the IPL going forward. ""He should open and give himself more time to make an impact on a game. When we picked him at 19, it was clear that he was at ease against extreme pace and very swift against the spinners. He should maximise that,"" he said.For Dasgupta, Pant needs to quickly shed the perception of him being a finisher in T20s. ""The world knows him as a capable player at No. 5 and No. 6. He needs to prove that he is a quality top-order player as well. He should not be batting any lower than No. 3 for LSG this year,"" Dasgupta said.",Rishabh Pant is currently the most expensive player in the history of IPL. But his limited-overs career for India has largely stagnated. This season of the T20 league could determine the 'keeper-batter's future prospects.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118958628,imgsize-45454,width-400,resizemode-4/118958628.jpg"

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

'Not going anywhere': Rohit Sharma on retirement from ODIs after winning the Champions Trophy

New Zealand have a knack of cracking the code when it comes to qualifying for the knockout rounds of ICC tournaments, and the just-concluded Champions Trophy was no different, where they made it to the final but lost to India at the last hurdle.However, former Australia captain Ricky Ponting didn't pick New Zealand as one of his four semifinalists before the start of the Champions Trophy. But they proved him wrong, which is why the batting legend has no doubt that it won't be long before the Kiwis taste title-winning success in a white-ball ICC tournament .The BlackCaps last won a white-ball ICC title in 2000, when they clinched the Champions Trophy.""I was asked at the start of the tournament who I thought the final four would be, and as soon as you start talking about top fours for ICC events, you just have to put New Zealand in it, because they just always do it,"" said Ponting in the latest The ICC Review.Ponting said that the reason he did not pick New Zealand in his top four was because he was confident that Pakistan would do well on home soil.""I didn't do it this time because I thought Pakistan would make it, being at home; and I thought South Africa would make it. So I didn't have New Zealand there and sure enough there they are again,"" he said. ""And what a dominant performance it was against South Africa in their semi-final to make it through to the final.""The Kiwis defeated South Africa by 50 runs in the second semifinal after putting up a mammoth 362 for 5 on the board at Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium.""You probably can't play a better game of one-day cricket than that. To bat first and make 360-odd, I think it's the highest total ever in a Champions Trophy game,"" said Ponting.But they faced a dominant, unbeaten Indian side in the final, who went on to beat the Kiwis for the second time in the tournament.India had won the group-stage game against New Zealand by 44 runs and defeated them in the final by four wickets.""They just came up against a really good team in the final, and they weren't far away. India won in the 49th or 50th over. They haven't done a lot wrong,"" Ponting added.""And that's without some of their stars actually performing in that final. And that's without Matt Henry being fit in that final as well, who was their leading wicket-taker going into it. So they've had a great campaign. And if they keep putting themselves there, it's only a matter of time before they will (win an ICC white-ball tournament).""",Ricky Ponting says it's only a matter of time before New Zealand win an ICC white-ball tournament. The Kiwis made it to the final of the Champions Trophy but lost to India. Ponting didn't pick New Zealand as one of his four semifinalists before the tournament.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118959977,imgsize-53380,width-400,resizemode-4/118959977.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Carlos Alcaraz , the two-time defending champion, showcased his dominance at the ATP Indian Wells Masters on Wednesday. The world number three from Spain overcame the challenging windy conditions on Stadium Court to deliver a commanding performance against Grigor Dimitrov , defeating him 6-1, 6-1.Alcaraz's victory denied Dimitrov's bid to join Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime as the only players to beat the Spaniard in three consecutive meetings. The Bulgarian had previously won their last two encounters, including the quarter-finals at the Miami Open last year.With his 50th ATP Masters 1000 match win, Alcaraz kept his hopes alive of joining Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three consecutive Indian Wells titles.Having reached the fourth round without dropping a set, Alcaraz produced his most impressive performance of the tournament. Despite the swirling winds that caused ball kids to scramble after blowing trash, Alcaraz appeared supremely untroubled.He broke Dimitrov's serve to open the match and secured the first set with another break. Alcaraz didn't face a break point until the fifth game of the second set, but he overcame that challenge with an ace on Dimitrov's third break chance.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian football legend Ronaldo , who is also a two-time World Cup winner, has withdrawn his intention to run for the presidency of the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) due to a lack of support from regional federations.In a social media post, the two-time Ballon d'Or winner stated that after publicly expressing his desire to become a candidate for the CBF presidency, he has officially withdrawn his intention.Ronaldo cited the lack of support from the majority of those with the power to decide as the reason for his withdrawal, stating that if they feel football is in good hands, his opinion does not matter.""After publicly declaring my desire to be a candidate for the presidency of the CBF during the next election, I'm officially withdrawing this intention. If the majority of those who have the power to decide feel that football is in good hands, it doesn't matter what I think,"" said Ronaldo.The 48-year-old had previously announced his intention to take the reins of the CBF in December, aiming to address what he perceived as a ""deep crisis"" in Brazilian football.However, Ronaldo revealed that 23 out of the 27 regional federations representing the various states of Brazil refused to listen to his proposals. Instead, they expressed their support for the re-election of the current CBF president, Ednaldo Rodrigues , in 2026.Rodrigues has faced criticism for his handling of the national team's coaching situation after Tite's departure following Brazil's quarter-final exit at the 2022 World Cup.Initially, Rodrigues pursued the appointment of Carlo Ancelotti, but the Italian coach ultimately decided to remain with Real Madrid. Eventually, Dorival Junior was appointed as the national team coach at the start of last year.Despite his illustrious career and desire to contribute to Brazilian football, Ronaldo's bid for the CBF presidency has been thwarted by the lack of support from the regional federations, who appear to favour the incumbent president's re-election.","Ronaldo has withdrawn his intention to run for the presidency of the Brazilian Football Confederation.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals captain Sanju Samson expresses his continued emotional attachment to former teammate Jos Buttler and wishes to abolish the IPL's player release regulation. The pair, who opened batting together for seven years, parted ways when the team chose not to retain Buttler before the previous year's mega auction.Buttler is set to represent Gujarat Titans in the upcoming IPL season.""The IPL gives you the opportunity to lead a team and play at the highest level, and it also allows you to build close friendships,"" Samson told Jiostar.""Jos Buttler is one of my closest friends. We played together for seven years. During this time, our batting partnership time itself is so long that we got to know each other so well.""He has been like an elder brother to me. Whenever I had a doubt, I would talk to him. When I became captain [in 2021], he was my vice-captain and helped me become a good captain.""Samson describes releasing Buttler as amongst his most difficult decisions. The team retained six players: Samson, Yashavi Jaiswal, Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel, Shimron Hetmyer and Sandeep Sharma.""Letting him go has been one of the most challenging decisions for me. During the England series, I told him over dinner that I was still not over it. If I could change one thing in the IPL, I would change the rule of releasing players every three years,"" he said.""While it has its positives, on a personal level, you lose that connect, that relation you built over years. He was a part of the family. What more can I say?""Despite Buttler's absence from the Royals' dugout, Samson is pleased about working again with head coach Rahul Dravid ""Rahul sir was the one who spotted me from the trials. He came up to me and said, 'Can you play for my team?' From there to now, with me being the captain of the franchise and him coming back - I'm very grateful, as we all are in the franchise, to have Rahul sir back,"" he said.""I have played under him [at RR] as a player when he was the captain and I have played under him in the Indian team when he was the coach. But a captain-coach relationship is very special and I'm very much looking forward to learning a lot from him.""","Rajasthan Royals captain Sanju Samson wishes to abolish the IPL's player release regulation.

MUMBAI: Legendary batter Sunil Gavaskar paid rich tributes to former India allrounder Abid Ali , who passed away on Wednesday at the age of 83.Abid took 47 wickets with his medium pace in the 29 Test matches he played for India.Famously, Abid was the batter who was in the middle when India recorded historic Test wins at Port of Spain and the Oval in the golden year of 1971. He allowed Gavaskar, the debutant, to make the winning hit in the first game, and hit the winning boundary himself in the second.""Very sad news, he was a lion-hearted cricketer who did anything the team needed. Despite being an all-rounder who batted in the middle order he opened the batting when needed. Took some incredible catches in the leg cordon adding an even sharper edge to our wonderful spin quartet. As a new ball bowler, he has the unique record of getting a wicket with the first ball of a Test match twice if memory serves me right,"" Gavaskar told TOI about Abid.""He loved the tip and run and when promoted up the order in my debut Test match this tactic resulted in some overthrows which reduced the pressure considerably.

'Not going anywhere': Rohit Sharma on retirement from ODIs after winning the Champions Trophy

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

Former Indian captain Dilip Vengsarkar expressed strong disapproval of the recent speculation surrounding Rohit Sharma 's retirement during the Champions Trophy . He emphasised that cricket legends like the current India captain should have autonomy in deciding their future.Rohit, 37, recently dismissed rumours about his retirement from ODI format after leading India to their second ICC title in nine months. However, he hasn't made any commitments regarding the 2027 ODI World Cup.""I am not an astrologer. A lot of matches to go till the 2027 World Cup. A lot will depend on his form and fitness. It is not fair to say anything at this stage but he has been outstanding as both captain and player. I don't know why people speculated (on his retirement), it's unwarranted. A player of his stature should get to decide about his future,"" Vengsarkar told PTI.Rohit's crucial batting performances in both the 2024 T20 World Cup and Champions Trophy proved valuable in challenging conditions. His aggressive approach in Dubai, particularly during the final against New Zealand, allowed other players to adapt to the slow pitch.""The way he has been playing all this time is nothing short of exemplary. He has got three double hundreds in ODI. What more do I say about him.""Guys like Virat and Rohit are big match players, bigger the platform the better the performance. It is very important from team's point of view. Their sheer presence is demoralising the opposition,"" said Vengsarkar, who is also a former chief selector who tracked both Rohit and Kohli in their early days.Rohit's success marks a significant turnaround from his previous struggles, which had led to him dropping himself from the final Test in Sydney.The team's victory was also supported by strong performances from Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul on Dubai's slow pitches.""Iyer did very well but I am not happy the way he got out in the final. He should have continued till the very end and finished the game. But happy to see him realise his potential.""KL too played a few important innings at number six but still not convinced Axar Patel batting ahead of him at five. The left-hand right-hand combination could be the only reason.""Vengsarkar also acknowledged the selection committee's role in the team's success.""Credit needs to go to the selectors as well. They stuck with Rohit after the Australia series. Even the decision to take five spinners in the squad proved to be a master stroke.""","Former Indian captain Dilip Vengsarkar expressed strong disapproval of the recent speculation surrounding Rohit Sharma's retirement.

Vaibhav Suryavanshi: The new prodigy

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

NEW DELHI: As the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 approaches, Rajasthan Royals (RR) captain Sanju Samson has shared insights into his cherished bond with former Indian skipper MS Dhoni and expressed his excitement about RR's young sensation, Vaibhav Suryavanshi .In a candid conversation on JioHotstar’s 'SuperStar' program, Samson spoke about his admiration for Dhoni and how their relationship has evolved over the years. Dhoni, who will be playing in the 2025 IPL season for Chennai Super Kings (CSK) under new captain Ruturaj Gaikwad, continues to be a massive influence on young cricketers.""Like every young Indian cricketer, I always wanted to be around MS Dhoni,"" Samson said. ""Every time we played against CSK, I wanted to sit and talk to him, ask him how he does things. It was a dream for me.""Recalling a special moment from a match against CSK in Sharjah, Samson added, ""I remember playing a match against CSK in Sharjah, where I finally performed well, scored around 70-80 runs, won the game, and became the Man of the Match. After that, I met Mahi bhai, and since then, our relationship has grown. Even now, I meet him often. Just yesterday, I met him again. It's truly a blessed feeling--to go from idolising him to now sitting with him for shoots and events. I feel like I'm living my dream.""While reflecting on his bond with Dhoni, Samson also spoke highly of Vaibhav Suryavanshi, the 13-year-old prodigy who became the youngest signing in IPL history last year. Acquired by RR for Rs 1.1 crore during the mega-auction, Vaibhav has already showcased his talent on the domestic circuit. He made his first-class debut for Bihar at just 12 years old and has impressed with his fearless six-hitting ability.Speaking on the youngster’s potential, Samson remarked, ""For me, rather than giving advice, I prefer observing first--how a youngster wants to play his cricket, what he likes, and what kind of support he needs from me. Then, I work my way around that. Vaibhav looks very confident; he was hitting sixes out of the ground at the academy. People were already talking about his power-hitting. What else can you ask for?""Suryavanshi, who played for India U19 against Australia last year and smashed a 58-ball century, also impressed in the ACC Under-19 Asia Cup 2024-25, scoring 176 runs in five matches. Samson believes that nurturing his natural talent while maintaining a supportive environment will be crucial for the youngster’s development.""The key is to keep him in the best shape and provide a relaxed environment, which is something the Rajasthan Royals (RR) is known for,"" Samson said. ""We ensure a positive atmosphere in the dressing room and back our players. You never know--he might end up playing for India in a couple of years. I feel he is ready for the IPL. He looks capable of landing a few solid punches here and there. Let us see what the future holds.""","Rajasthan Royals (RR) captain Sanju Samson has shared insights into his cherished bond with former Indian skipper MS Dhoni.
