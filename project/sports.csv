"In Uttar Pradesh, Aadhaar touts clone 'deputy CM'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-uttar-pradesh-aadhaar-touts-clone-deputy-cm/articleshow/120676577.cms,"Poll Do you believe that the Aadhaar Seva Kendra system is secure against fraud? No, prone to fraud Yes, completely secure

LUCKNOW: Barely a few paces from the Uttar Pradesh Assembly in Lucknow, fearless touts at an Aadhaar Seva Kendra (ASK) promise and deliver anything for a price. They even conjure up a name uncannily similar to that of deputy CM Brajesh Pathak .When this reporter visited the Vidhan Sabha Marg-based Ratan square complex to test a widely rumoured tout racket, he was in for many surprises. The crowded Aadhaar Kendra had touts lurking everywhere, among them three young women in their mid-20s who were also part of the syndicate.One such tout, who identified himself as Rajesh, approached this reporter. ""I'm from Bakshi Ka Talab area and a huge admirer of deputy CM Brajesh Pathak. I wish to change my name from Brijesh Pathak to Brajesh Pathak, but there are no documents to support this,"" the reporter dropped the bait. ""Ho jayega (it will be done),"" Rajesh nodded.The tout got down to work. He pulled out his phone, downloaded a real voter ID (EPIC) of another Brajesh Pathak from Badaun, pasted the reporter's photo on it, and added a fake barcode. Within minutes, he booked an instant Aadhaar update appointment - at 12:50 pm - the same day. ""Go straight to the verifier. No questions will be asked,"" Rajesh assured, pocketing Rs 1,500 via UPI.Inside the Aadhaar Seva Kendra, the script unfolded exactly as promised. The verifier at counter-5 barely glanced at the forged documents. At 2 pm, ""Brajesh Pathak"", along with nearly 20 others who sought touts' help, was called - ahead of genuine applicants. The reporter was directed to counter-22, where a young woman operator mechanically processed the update, taking his iris scan. In less than an hour, a fake identity was born. The reporter was embedded in a team of officials who had gone to carry out checks at the ASK after reports swirled about IDs being fabricated.For the last five years, the ASK in question has been operated by Smart Chip Private Limited , the Indian subsidiary of French multinational IDEMIA group.After the successful sting operation, TOI contacted the group's officials for comment on the rigged system at Lucknow centre. But after waiting for a day, an official IDEMIA source said: ""Since we are under contract of UIDAI (govt agency which issues Aadhaar), we cannot comment."" However, the source acknowledged that there were indeed a few staff at Ratan Square ASK allegedly involved in malpractices. But still, Smart Chip Private Limited has no mandate to check documents.A day earlier, the UIDAI regional office of Lucknow, too, had sent at least two decoys to the Ratan Square ASK, and found that touts in connivance with Smart Chip Private Limited staff were involved in malpractices.Speaking to TOI, Prashant Kumar Singh, deputy DG of UIDAI (Lucknow region), acknowledged the matter. ""A recent surprise inspection at ASK Ratan Square revealed irregularities, prompting a decoy operation on April 21 that uncovered the modus operandi. The matter has been escalated to the agency concerned for probe and filing an FIR. We assure all UIDAI's backend quality checks verify document genuineness, rejecting any fake submissions..""",Touts promise and deliver anything for a price at an Aadhaar Seva Kendra (ASK) They conjure up a name uncannily similar to that of deputy CM Brajesh Pathak.

Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's lawsuit could drag Taylor Swift into the legal spotlight

Critics warn that Taylor Swift’s good girl persona could finally crack under scrutiny

In a twist no one saw coming, Taylor Swift ’s famously polished “good girl” image could face its biggest test yet — and it’s all tied to the intensifying legal drama between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni . While Swift isn’t directly involved in the lawsuits, her close friendship with Lively and alleged behind-the-scenes influence on the movie It Ends With Us has placed her uncomfortably close to the fire.The heart of the conflict revolves around dueling lawsuits. Blake Lively has accused Justin Baldoni of sexual harassment and orchestrating a smear campaign during the filming of It Ends With Us. In retaliation, Baldoni countersued Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds, and her publicist Leslie Sloane for defamation.Swift’s name reportedly came up because she allegedly helped ""pressure"" Baldoni to change a major scene and also contributed a song to the movie’s soundtrack. A source told People magazine, “Anyone that had any knowledge of this situation will be subpoenaed, no matter their celebrity status.” Another insider countered, emphasizing that Swift and Hugh Jackman, another close friend, are “not aware of anything going on.”Commentator Candace Owens didn’t mince words, claiming that 2025 has been a year of karma catching up to celebrities. “Their image of Taylor Swift is going to be shattered once these text messages become public because I have never bought the good girl thing that she pitches,” Owens said on her Candace podcast. She suggested Swift has “become addicted” to the victim narrative since her public feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian.Owens added, “I really do feel 2025 has just been this game of karma, and a lot of people are being exposed for who they truly are.”Despite the growing media frenzy, sources close to Taylor Swift maintain that her role is nonexistent. As an insider told Us Weekly, “Taylor has always been Blake’s friend, but Taylor does not have any involvement in the case. She wasn’t a part of the movie. Taylor was not a producer on the film and had no creative involvement.”Also Read: Was Travis Kelce's beau Taylor Swift hurt by Blake Lively’s lawsuit?

Desmond Watson signs with Buccaneers, becomes heaviest player ever to join an NFL team



After going undrafted in the 2025 NFL Draft, Desmond Watson , one of the Florida Gators ' most beloved fan favorites, has landed a spot with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . The towering 6-foot-5, 464-pound defensive tackle inked an undrafted free agent contract with the Buccaneers just moments after the draft ended, marking him as the team's first UDFA signing. The contract includes a $20,000 signing bonus and $50,000 in guaranteed money, offering Watson a strong foundation as he embarks on his NFL journey.Desmond Watson's unique combination of size and skill makes him a standout figure in the NFL. At 464 pounds, Watson now holds the record as the heaviest player in NFL history , surpassing the previous record set by offensive tackle Aaron Gibson by an impressive 54 pounds. Watson joins a talented group of nose tackles in Tampa Bay, including Vita Vea and Greg Gaines. Over his collegiate career, Watson accumulated 63 tackles, 1.5 sacks, and a memorable forced fumble and recovery in 2022, which cemented his place in Gators history.Though Watson was not invited to the NFL Scouting Combine, his performance at Florida's Pro Day captured the attention of scouts. He clocked an impressive 5.95-second 40-yard dash, making him the third slowest runner of all time at his size but still managing to impress those in attendance. Additionally, Watson's 36 reps on the bench press would have been the highest at the Combine, demonstrating his raw strength and athleticism despite his considerable size.Tampa Bay's head coach, Billy Napier, praised Watson’s exceptional abilities. ""He's a unicorn. That stature,"" Napier said at the Pro Day. ""And then, you get to know Des. He's extremely intelligent. He's got a great sense of humor. He was a great teammate. Obviously showed up in good shape (for pro day). He'll get his shot, and I'm hoping he'll make the most of it.""What makes Watson's journey even more remarkable is his hometown connection to Tampa Bay. Born and raised in Plant City, Florida, Watson will now have the opportunity to play just hours away from where he made his mark both in high school at Armwood and in college with the Gators. This proximity adds an extra layer of excitement as he competes for a spot on the Buccaneers' roster, with the potential to play in front of a familiar Florida crowd in the NFL.While Watson's weight has been a topic of discussion throughout his career, it’s clear he has made significant strides. Prior to the draft, Watson spoke about his weight management efforts: ""There (are) times where I do basically starving and stuff like that... I didn’t feel confident that way. I didn’t feel strong, I didn’t feel fast. I feel like right now is the best I felt with the process of losing weight.""Watson’s commitment to fitness has been evident as he worked with a weight and fitness specialist leading up to the draft. His goal of losing approximately 100 pounds was achieved through a disciplined diet that cut out sugar and starches, relying on peas, beans, chili, and spinach as key components of his meals.As the Buccaneers continue to strengthen their roster, Watson's signing marks a significant opportunity for him to prove himself. The team had already bolstered their edge rushing corps with two new signings in the 2025 draft but left room for a potential interior defensive lineman. With no other interior D-linemen drafted, Watson's chance to compete for a backup role behind Pro Bowler Vita Vea is very much alive.Desmond Watson's path to the NFL may have been unconventional, but his hard work, dedication, and Florida roots have given him the chance to shine at the highest level of football. Whether or not he secures a starting position, one thing is clear—Watson’s journey is just beginning, and fans across Florida will be cheering him on every step of the way.Also Read: ""Clueless for 50 years"": ESPN’s Mel Kiper Jr. slams NFL teams for letting Shedeur Sanders slip to fifth round","Desmond Watson is the heaviest player ever to join an NFL team at 464 pounds.

When George Russell was Lewis Hamilton's teammate at Mercedes

George Russell and Lewis Hamilton were teammates at Mercedes until last year. But the times have changed drastically, as Hamilton has now switched to Ferrari , where he is yet to find his footing. Meanwhile, Russell is having a fantastic season and is just one position away from clinching his first win of the season, if McLaren misses the mark by chance. The roaring Mercedes driver has now said that if it was a different era, he would have already won two championships.George Russell was reflecting on his past years at Mercedes when Lewis Hamilton was leading the World Championship. He stresses that it’s not him who has changed, but the times. Russell was two positions ahead of Hamilton in the Driver Standings when he joined Mercedes in 2022, and once again left him behind in 2024 when Hamilton started losing his winning streak.Talking about his time with Hamilton, Russell told The Athletic, “Everybody is in Lewis’s shadow. Being teammates with a seven-time World Champion for three years is not straightforward. There was once a time that if you finished ahead of Lewis Hamilton in a championship or in a race, you’d win the race. Or, if you finished ahead of him in the championship, you’d win the championship. If my time was five years prior, you could argue I’d have two championships to my name.”At present, Russell is in 4th place, while Hamilton, who now drives for Ferrari, is way behind in 7th in the Driver Standings. Opening up about the same, Russell said, “I’m just going about my business, as I have been the last couple of years. I’m working with the same group of engineers, the same group of mechanics. Obviously, Lewis was such a large presence that you know that he’s not around.”“But on the day-to-day running of things, it is no different. I'm sat at my desk in front of my computer. I do my warm-up in my room, I jump in my race car, I put my helmet on. I want to control my own destiny first and foremost,"" he added.Also Read: George Russell: George Russell seen in super-rare $5.4 million Mercedes AMG One with Alex Albon in Monaco Russell has claimed three podiums in five races and is currently the only one, other than Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, giving McLaren a tough competition.

End to end

Seville: Barcelona defender Jules Kounde struck deep in extra-time to decide a gripping Copa del Rey Clasico final on Saturday in Seville, earning his side a 3-2 win over rivals Real Madrid .The Catalans, aiming for a quadruple this season, won the first major trophy of Hansi Flick's reign as coach and a record-extending 32nd Spanish cup in dramatic fashion.Three Real Madrid players were sent off during and after a fiery conclusion to the game, including England international Jude Bellingham.Pedri sent Barcelona ahead at La Cartuja but two Real Madrid goals in seven second-half minutes, from Kylian Mbappe and Aurelien Tchouameni, pulled the Spanish and European champions level.However, Ferran Torres struck in the 84th minute to take the game to extra-time and Kounde drilled home to win it for the La Liga leaders.""Madrid pushed us to our limits but we showed great character and pride,"" said Kounde.Barca host Inter Milan in the Champions League semi-finals on Wednesday.""They can make a party -- for today, it's OK,"" a delighted Flick, who has won all seven finals he has coached in his career, told Movistar.Substituted Madrid defender Antonio Rudiger was sent off in the final seconds for ""throwing an object"" onto the pitch towards referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea, according to the official's report, and Lucas Vazquez, also replaced, was dismissed for further protest as Madrid unravelled.Bellingham was sent off after the final whistle for showing an ""aggressive attitude"" towards the referee, who wrote that the midfielder ""had to be restrained by his team-mates"".""I don't want to talk about the referee,"" said stone-faced Madrid coach Ancelotti.""I don't know what happened at the end."" Madrid had issued furious statements about the refereeing team on Friday after they criticised the club's television channel for attacking Spanish officials this season, casting a shadow over the game.Controversy aside, the football was enthralling.Madrid started with top scorer Mbappe on the bench after an ankle injury and lost Ferland Mendy early on with a thigh issue.Barcelona dazzling winger Lamine Yamal, 17, dyed his hair blond for the game and led the assault on Thibaut Courtois' goal.The Catalans, who also won the first two Clasicos this season in La Liga and the Spanish Super Cup, scoring nine goals in the process, controlled the ball.They took the lead after 28 minutes, Pedri placing the ball into the top corner with precision and power from the edge of the box, a sensational goal set up by Yamal.Barcelona's opener brought Madrid out of their shell -- and also Mbappe off the bench to warm up.Bellingham netted but was offside. Vinicius Junior would have won a penalty when hacked down but had also strayed off in the build-up.Barcelona could have doubled their lead, with Dani Olmo's corner hitting the post and Cubarsi unable to turn home as Dani Ceballos held him back.The referee was lenient with some heated Madrid tackles, perhaps cowed by Friday's drama as the Spanish champions seethed at his pre-match comments.Madrid sent Mbappe on for Rodrygo Goes at half-time and soon he and Vinicius began to work Barcelona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny.Mbappe pulled Madrid level almost on his own in the 70th minute, brought down after surging forward and firing home the free-kick off the post.Seven minutes later Madrid took the lead, Tchouameni heading in Arda Guler's corner.Barcelona responded when Yamal played a delicious pass over the top for Torres, which drew both Rudiger and Courtois, but the Spaniard beat both and rolled home.Controversy unsurprisingly reared its head before the match headed to extra-time.Barcelona clamoured for a penalty when Rudiger tripped Torres, and then were awarded one deep in stoppage time as Raphinha tumbled under pressure -- but the decision was overturned after a VAR review.In extra-time Barcelona were ascendent.They found their winner when Kounde intercepted an uncharacteristically loose Luka Modric pass and beat Courtois from range, sparking wild celebrations.The trio of dismissals and Madrid's pre-match histrionics regarding the officials will ensure the repercussions run on.The teams meet again in La Liga in May in a potential title decider.",Barcelona beat Real Madrid 3-2 in the Copa del Rey final in Seville.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

After their commanding victory over Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya made a noteworthy revelation about his limited bowling contribution on Sunday, having bowled only one over on Sunday.Hardik bowled the ninth over of the match. He was greeted by LSG opener Mitchell Marsh with consecutive boundaries but recovered strongly, conceding just two singles in his subsequent four deliveries.At the post-match presentation ceremony, when questioned about bowling only one over, the Mumbai Indians skipper replied, ""I bowl when I am required.""Hardik then elaborated on his decision to hold back and provide debutant Corbin Bosch with the opportunity to complete his quota of overs. The South African all-rounder had an excellent debut, smashing a quick-fire 20 off 10 balls and delivering an economical bowling spell of 1 for 26 in his four overs.""Today was the best chance for Bosch to come in and bowl,"" he stated.It was indeed a clinical performance by the five-time champions, Mumbai Indians.

If one of us had played a little longer and won that game, it would have been very different. And winning an IPL is so special. That 2016 season was very special for RCB .

Lucknow Super Giants:

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants ’ fast bowler Mayank Yadav made a rousing return to competitive cricket, striking in style by dismissing Rohit Sharma in their IPL clash against Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday.Returning after a long injury layoff, Mayank was handed the new ball by skipper Rishabh Pant and showed no signs of rust. His first over, bowled to Ryan Rickelton, featured four deliveries clocking over 140 kmph. Although Rickelton managed a boundary, Mayank’s control and sharp pace were impressive after nearly seven months out.The real highlight came in Mayank’s second over. After Rohit Sharma smashed him for back-to-back sixes — a deep square hit followed by a signature pull over square leg — the young pacer responded brilliantly. Regaining his composure, Mayank delivered a slower short ball that Rohit steered straight to Prince Yadav at short third man, falling for 12 off five balls.Mayank’s comeback is significant, given his injury struggles — including five stress fractures and a recent toe injury that delayed his return after joining LSG on April 16. His last competitive game was a T20I against Bangladesh in October 2024.Replacing Shardul Thakur in the XI, the 22-year-old's successful return was a major boost for LSG, who elected to field first after winning the toss.Mumbai Indians made two changes themselves, bringing in Karn Sharma and debutant Corbin Bosch.Ryan Rickelton (wk), Rohit Sharma, Will Jacks, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya (capt), Naman Dhir, Corbin Bosch, Trent Boult, Deepak Chahar, Karn SharmaAiden Markram, Mitchell Marsh, Nicholas Pooran, Rishabh Pant(wk/capt), Abdul Samad, Ayush Badoni, Digvesh Singh Rathi, Ravi Bishnoi, Avesh Khan, Prince Yadav, Mayank Yadav",Lucknow Super Giants fast bowler Mayank Yadav made a rousing return to competitive cricket.

Can the Bucks turn the series around?

Key concerns for the Milwaukee Bucks

Doc Rivers remains confident despite 0-2 deficit

What the Bucks need to do differently

Theare in a must-win situation as they face the Indiana Pacers in Game 3 of their playoff series. Down 2-0, the Bucks need a spark to turn things around—and all eyes are onThe good news for Milwaukee Bucks fans is that Giannis Antetokounmpo will suit up tonight. Despite the team’s struggles in the first two games, the Greek Freak has been dominant, dropping 34 points, 18 rebounds, and 7 assists in Game 2. His presence alone gives Milwaukee a fighting chance, but he can’t do it alone.The injury report is mostly clean for Milwaukee, with only one player under scrutiny:- Tyler Smith (Questionable) – His absence hasn’t heavily impacted the Bucks this season, so his status won’t drastically alter the rotation.Here’s how Milwaukee is expected to line up for Game 3:The Pacers have outplayed Milwaukee so far, capitalizing on the Bucks’ mistakes and lack of urgency. Tyrese Haliburton has been a key factor, and Indiana’s aggressive play has exposed Milwaukee’s weaknesses.- Damian Lillard’s struggles – In Game 2, Lillard managed only 14 points, 7 assists, and 3 rebounds. The Bucks need him to regain his rhythm.- Defensive lapses – The Pacers have controlled the tempo, and Milwaukee must tighten up defensively.- Over-reliance on Giannis – While Antetokounmpo is a force, the supporting cast must step up.Bucks head coach Doc Rivers isn’t panicking yet.

Fiery Stories Ep. 1 | Aniket Verma | #TATAIPL2025

FOR CHACHU WITH LOVE

Sunrisers Hyderabad batter Aniket Verma (R) with his uncle Amit Verma (L).

A NATURAL

Aniket Verma 's childhood hero is Hardik Pandya Aniket was not only captivated by Hardik Pandya's strokeplay but also intrigued by his backstory. His uncle, Amit Verma, narrated the story of how Hardik and his brother Krunal survived on Maggi for three years due to financial constraints. ""Aniket must have been 14 back then. I read it in a newspaper and told him the story while we were on our way to his academy,"" Amit told TimesofIndia.com.The distance between Verma's rented accommodation and the Ankur Cricket Academy, where Aniket trained, was 13 kilometers. Amit recalls that his nephew kept asking him about Hardik Pandya's journey, his struggles, and rise. ""That day, I saw the spirit, the passion, and the hunger in him. He wanted to make it big. Once we reached the stadium, he touched my feet and said, 'I complain about trivial things.' I laughed, but he was serious,"" he says.Fast forward to the present, and Aniket is making waves in the IPL with his six-hitting abilities. In just 56 balls, he has already hit 12 sixes. On Sunday, against Delhi Capitals, with his team at 25 for 3, he smashed a 41-ball 74, studded with five fours and six sixes. Against Lucknow Super Giants, he clobbered a 13-ball 36 with five maximums. The sample size is small, but against spin, he is as effective as his Sunrisers teammate Heinrich Klaasen. He picks up lengths early and muscles the ball over the boundary rope.Aniket lost his mother when he was three. A year later, his father remarried. This forced his grandmother, Parvati Verma, to move to Bhopal alongside Amit.""We moved to Bhopal. I had just finished school. My late father was in the Railways, so my mother received his pension. She took care of me and Anni (Aniket's nickname). Since I called her 'Ma' or 'Mummy,' Aniket also picked it up and calls her the same. It was tough, but we managed,"" recounts Amit.When Aniket turned eight, Amit, a cricket enthusiast, took him to Nand Jeet Singh, a coach at Railways Youth Sports Club in Bhopal. Impressed by young Aniket's hand-eye coordination and aware of their financial situation, Nand Jeet waived his fees. Aniket trained there for two years before Nand Jeet sent him to Jyoti Prakash Tyagi. ""Unique kid. He called me before joining the squad. I gave him my blessings. The family stayed in one of my flats for years. I have seen him grow in stature,"" says Singh.Before the IPL started, when TimesofIndia.com reached out to Aniket for an interview, his first response was, ""Brother, I haven't achieved anything yet. I'm not even a regular for MP. Can we do this interview after the IPL season?"" After some persuasion, the youngster replied, ""You talk to my uncle. He can tell you better. His life has revolved around me.""Amit, who returned to Bhopal after traveling with Aniket for the first three matches, became emotional when he unwrapped the gift Aniket gave him. Aniket had asked him to open it once he reached home. It was a branded shoe with a message: ""To the world's best Chachu.""""My first job was at an automobile showroom. My salary was Rs 3,000. He was playing with torn shoes. I immediately took him to the shop and bought him sports shoes that cost Rs 1,200. I had never worn something that expensive in my life, but for him, I would have done anything. He slept with his new shoes that day,"" laughs Amit, who now works for a private company and earns Rs 20,000 per month.Aniket's coach, Jyoti Prakash Tyagi, says his ward was always a natural and played with aggressive intent, but he feels the 23-year-old is still raw and needs to work on certain areas.""There is no question about his work ethic. I have seen that those who don't think about Plan 'B' or 'C' are the ones who nail their Plan 'A' with precision. I never stopped him from playing aggressive cricket. Now, cricket has changed. His strength is to go aerial and take on the bowlers. Why curb that aggression? It's his strength,"" says Tyagi.""I still feel he needs to learn how to finish games. He must develop that temperament if he wants to play for his country. He will learn from experience, and in the next games, I would like him to take his team home. The intent should remain the same,"" he says.Aniket was scouted by Sunrisers Hyderabad during the 2024 Madhya Pradesh Premier League . Playing for Bhopal Leopards, he amassed 273 runs in six innings, hitting a staggering 25 sixes.""We were over the moon when he was hitting sixes for fun in the MPL. Never thought he would do the same in the IPL,"" said Amit with a laugh.","Aniket Verma is making waves in the IPL with his six-hitting abilities. In just 56 balls, he has already hit 12 sixes.

Sachin Tendulkar at 52: Power, Pride, and a Nation’s Pulse

NEW DELHI: The India vs Pakistan cricket debate has once again reignited following the recent Pahalgam terror attack . Amid rising tensions, Pakistan women's cricket team opener Gull Feroza has reinforced her team’s position regarding participation in matches scheduled in India.Feroza, who featured in three games during the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier as an opener, confirmed that Pakistan will not travel to India for the main tournament. Pakistan secured qualification for the 2025 ICC Women’s World Cup , which is scheduled to be held in India this September.With Pakistan’s qualification now confirmed, so is the likelihood of a hybrid model for the tournament—similar to the one used in the Asia Cup—where their matches against India will be hosted at a neutral venue. The development has sparked controversy, especially with India set to host the global event.Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi had already stated that the team would not travel to India for the World Cup.Meanwhile, Feroza echoed that sentiment in a conversation with PakPassion.“We know this much that we will play in Asian conditions and we are not playing in India. This is clear. Neither are we interested in playing in India,” Feroza told PakPassion.Also See: IPL Live Score, KKR vs PBKS “So, wherever it is played - hopefully in Sri Lanka or Dubai - those conditions are similar to the ones you get in Asia.

So, our preparation will be according to that, and we are ready for that,” she added.Earlier this year, the Indian men's team also declined to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy.

Memphis Commercial Appeal

Oklahoma City Thunder guard Luguentz Dort faced backlash from Memphis Grizzlies fans after his foul caused the team's star, Ja Morant, to suffer a hard fall and exit the game before he could lead a potential comeback. Dort has addressed the incident, calling Morant’s fall “unintentional” and expressing concern after learning Morant had sustained a hip contusion.After the Oklahoma City Thunder erased all the progress Memphis had made in the first half and defeated them 114-108, Dort gave a clarification, saying he didn’t intend to hurt Morant and that it all happened in the heat of the moment. He said, as reported by the, “Tough one. Obviously, I hope he’s OK. I was running back, making a hustle play for my team. I was running quick, stopped on a dime. I didn’t know he was behind me, and I was slipping. I tried to make a play on the ball, but we just ran into each other, and he fell down. But I hope he’s OK. I didn’t mean to hit him like that.”Dort even approached Morant to express regret for unintentionally hurting him. He said, “When he was at the line, I dapped him up and I apologized obviously. It's never good when a good player like that goes down. But people can say whatever they want. He dapped me up. That was it. That was enough. At least he knows that I didn't mean to take him down like that.""The Grizzlies might have won the game against the Oklahoma City Thunder had Ja Morant not suffered the hip injury. Morant still got up and limped to the line to take his free throws, which he missed. He received a standing ovation from the fans for his courage.

Interim heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall awaits for a title unification bout against heavyweight champion Jon Jones

How The UFC Heavyweight Champion Spends His Week | Tom Aspinall

It’s been quite a while since the English fighterwas last seen in the Octagon. Bringing his MMA record to 15-3-0, Aspinall’s previous match was against Curtis Blaydes, where he successfully defended his heavyweight interim title. With Jon Jones returning to the Octagon and claiming the heavyweight title, the MMA community has started speculating about a title unification bout within the heavyweight division of the UFC . However, with no official announcement for quite a while now, Aspinall andhave joined the league of frustrated fans while waiting for the confirmation. Andy expressed discontent towardsand its executives, includingfor the delayed announcement.Tom Aspinall has been training hard, without a definitive date for stepping into the Octagon. Not just the date, but even the opponent’s name has been doing the rounds in speculation. While UFC boss Dana White has confirmed that a bout between Aspinall and heavyweight champion Jon Jones is imminent, however, a lack of official announcement has not just had the fans restless but also invoked a raging opinion from the fighter’s father, Andy.Andy, being the head trainer of Aspinall, expressed his disappointment in a recent video on the fighter’s official YouTube channel. The discontent not only stems from the fact that Aspinall has been training blind without a date being fixed but also from the fact that the head coach gets paid according to the bouts fought by the fighter. Aspinall hasn’t fought anyone since July 2024, and the wait is affecting both the fighter and his father, as a head coach, financially.In the recent video, when Andy was asked about his opinion on the long wait, the trainer’s response was filled with frustration and rage.“It’s just a massive pain in the a** really. Tom is just staying fit, really. We’re putting different things into his game and everybody’s game that comes, but it would be really nice because he’s a fighter if he could have a fight.” he continued to add, “He’s had three fights that have lasted a minute a piece his last three fights. It is what it is but we could do with more fights. It’s nice to train for somebody, but otherwise you just go to the gym and train, you like to go with a purpose.”Aspinall’s father further explained the issue of payment, “Also, this is his living and you need to be making money from your living. Especially when you’re fit and healthy rather than sitting on your a** every day and just turning up for training all the time. In terms of purely as a coach I’m not getting paid because Tom’s not getting paid. It’s not just about money, it’s about ‘do you want your fighters to have fights when they’re fit to fight? He’s not having fights and it’s frustrating but what do you do?”Andy doesn’t necessarily believe that his son needs to fight Jones for his next bout. Being a fighter, who is training almost regularly, Aspinall, at this point, just needs a worthy opponent, even if it is not Jones. Andy commented on the very blockage that has been created by UFC in letting Aspinall announce his next bout.“It’s stupid. I have no idea the reason why the UFC don’t want Tom to fight anybody else other than Jon Jones. ‘Stay tuned.’ That’s the message they wanted Tom to give out to people… we’re in April now, still waiting for Jon to say ‘I’ll have a fight’ or ‘I’ll not have a fight’. I don’t really understand that. He’s a fighter who should be having fights. Why’s Jon still sat around not giving an answer as to whether he’s gonna fight or not?”Also read: ""None of it is true"" – Dricus du Plessis clears the air on injury rumors UFC boss Dana White, in his recent post-fight interview of UFC Kansas City on April 26, 2025, did assure the MMA fans about a potential title unification bout between Jon Jones and Tom Aspinall.

Damian Lillard’s injury update after early exit in Game 4



The Milwaukee Bucks ’ postseason dreams took a devastating blow Sunday night when star guard Damian Lillard went down with a non-contact injury just minutes into Game 4 against the Indiana Pacers. The scene at Fiserv Forum quickly shifted from tense to heartbreaking as Lillard, one of the NBA’s most explosive scorers, grabbed at his lower left leg and couldn't continue.Midway through the first quarter, while attempting to secure an offensive rebound after a missed three-pointer by Gary Trent Jr., Lillard tipped the ball but immediately stumbled and collapsed to the floor. Cameras captured the painful moment as Lillard clutched his left ankle and heel area, clearly in distress. He remained seated even as the play continued at the other end. It was Bucks forward Kyle Kuzma who helped him to his feet, but Lillard couldn't put any weight on his left leg and had to be escorted to the locker room.The Bucks quickly ruled him out for the rest of the game, writing on X, ""Damian Lillard (left lower leg injury) will not return to tonight's game."" NBA insider Chris Haynes later reported the troubling news that ""the fear is Bucks star Damian Lillard suffered a left Achilles tear ,"" calling it a ""brutal circumstance after working himself back from a blood clot diagnosis that kept him out over a month.""This injury is particularly cruel considering the journey Lillard had just undertaken. He missed the last 14 games of the regular season battling deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right leg, a dangerous condition involving blood clots that could have ended his career. Lillard made a remarkably swift comeback in Game 2 of the series, only to now face another potentially devastating setback.Before the injury, Lillard had only logged six minutes, missing both of his field goal attempts and tallying two rebounds and two assists. Despite his limited output earlier in the series— averaging just 10.5 points on 24% shooting— Lillard's presence was crucial for a Bucks team already trailing the Pacers 2-1. Now, with a crucial Game 5 looming at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, Milwaukee faces the daunting prospect of fighting without both Lillard and a still-recovering Giannis Antetokounmpo.Lillard’s injury history has been well-documented. According to Fox Sports, he has suffered 62 injuries in his 13-year career, with 34 involving his legs. Now at 34 years old, and under contract until 2027, the fear of an Achilles tear casts a long shadow over both his future and that of the Bucks.Also Read: “I’m just sick to my stomach” – Frustrated Magic Johnson slams Los Angeles Lakers following Game 4 loss to Minnesota Timberwolves While an official diagnosis is pending, Lillard is scheduled to undergo an MRI on Monday, per ESPN's Shams Charania.","Damian Lillard went down with a non-contact injury just minutes into Game 4 against the Indiana Pacers.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

Poll Should KL Rahul be India's first-choice wicketkeeper for the T20 format? Unsure No, we need someone else Only if he maintains form Absolutely

It has been a rollercoaster ride for KL Rahul in ODIs over the past one and a half years. He has been India's mainstay in the middle-order and with the gloves behind the wicket.Kl Rahul delivered a stellar performance at the 2023 ODI World Cup, scoring 452 runs in 11 matches at an impressive average of 75.33. In the Champions Trophy, he again showed his class. His tally of 136 runs in the tournament might not win him many awards, but his importance to India in the middle order was immense. In the semifinal against Australia, he finished unbeaten on 42 and then steered India to their back-to-back ICC titles, finishing unbeaten on 34 off 33 balls against New Zealand in the final.The right-hander was not just outstanding with the bat but also proved invaluable behind the stumps — guiding bowlers, assisting Rohit Sharma with DRS calls, and maintaining composure under pressure.The emotions were raw and visible when KL Rahul finally lifted the Champions Trophy — his maiden ICC title. He knew exactly how much it meant to him.However, despite his efforts, he was overlooked for the ICC T20 World Cup in the USA and West Indies — a tournament India went on to win.Once an all-format mainstay, KL Rahul is once again digging deep to force his way back into India's T20I setup. In fact, it seems he is already chasing another piece of ICC silverware — the 2026 T20 World Cup. The mega event is scheduled to be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka between February and March 2026.Will he make it back into India's T20I squad? Looking at his current form, the answer seems increasingly positive.KL Rahul is in ominous touch — playing lofted drives, straight shots, pulls, and flicks — and is as sharp as ever behind the stumps. With 364 runs in 8 matches, Rahul is currently the highest run-getter for his team, Delhi Capitals , in IPL 2025.Delhi Capitals mentor and former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen declared KL Rahul as his ""first-choice to bat at No. 4 for India.""""I back KL at No. 4 for India in T20 cricket,"" Pietersen told reporters after the Delhi Capitals' loss to Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Delhi.""You've got Rohit and Yashasvi — you've got Surya, who bats at the top, you've got all of these guys. But the way KL Rahul is playing cricket now, he would be my first choice to bat at four and keep wicket for India,"" Pietersen said.""KL has been playing in a very positive manner since mid to late last year. We saw how he finished off a couple of games for India and almost sealed the deal for you guys in the Champions Trophy in Dubai. I've had a lot of incredibly brilliant conversations with him about batting — a lot of deep and meaningful conversations — because when you grow up as a youngster like he did, you're taught defence, elbow up, playing in the V.""Then, all of a sudden, in your 30s, you've got to change and become a different kind of player for a format that's evolving all the time. It's very, very difficult. The way he has accepted that he needed to change, and the way he has changed, is great credit to the person he is.""He is so positive — the way he practices, the way he trains, the way he thinks about the game, and also the way he talks about the game,"" Pietersen said.KL Rahul (41 off 39 balls) top-scored for Delhi Capitals, helping his side post a competitive total of 162/8 in 20 overs.In response, Krunal Pandya and Virat Kohli struck half-centuries to guide Royal Challengers Bengaluru to a six-wicket win over Delhi Capitals.The duo stitched together a 119-run partnership off 84 balls as RCB chased down the 163-run target in 18.3 overs, extending their unbeaten run away from home.With the win, RCB notched up their seventh victory in 10 games, while Delhi Capitals suffered only their third loss in nine matches. Both teams remain firmly on track for a place in the playoffs.","Kl Rahul has been India's mainstay in the middle-order and with the gloves behind the wicket.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

Faf back but failed

NEW DELHI: How often do we see a home crowd cheering for the opposition? But that’s exactly what unfolded at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday. The roar was deafening when Royal Challengers Bengaluru captain Rajat Patidar won the toss and opted to field against Delhi Capitals. The crowd erupted, cheering at the top of their lungs — and it was all for one man, their beloved local hero, Virat Kohli.Kohli (51 off 47) didn’t disappoint, anchoring the chase with a composed half-century, while Krunal Pandya’s majestic knock (73 not out off 47) powered RCB to a six-wicket win over Delhi Capitals, propelling them to the top of the points table.Just a couple of months ago, the scenes at the Arun Jaitley Stadium were completely different during the Ranji Trophy match between Delhi and Railways, which featured Kohli. Fans wrapped in thick jackets, mufflers, and woollen caps braved the biting cold, hands tucked into pockets, just for a glimpse of the action.This time, it was the opposite.Sweat-soaked, clutching water bottles, wiping their faces with handkerchiefs, sporting hats and sunglasses, Delhiites battled the scorching heat — all for the chance to see their superstar Kohli in action. 35000 fans flocked inside the stadium to watch Kohli in action.Every time Kohli moved to collect the ball, sprinted for a single, or struck a boundary, the stadium echoed with chants of ""Kohli, Kohli.""Kohli played the perfect anchor, constantly walking up to Krunal Pandya for quick chats, offering fist pumps, and shouting words of encouragement from the other end. His energy never dipped as he guided the partnership forward.Krunal built his innings patiently. After his superb effort with the ball, he assessed the conditions smartly, waited for loose deliveries, and made sure to dispatch them to the boundary ropes whenever they came his way.Krunal reached his half-century off 38 balls, bringing it up with a boundary off Axar Patel. Kohli, all smiles, rushed forward to hug him in celebration of a brilliant effort.Bought by RCB for Rs 5.75 crore at the IPL 2025 mega auction, Krunal scored 73 not out off 47 balls and was involved in a 119-run partnership with Kohli.Kohli, meanwhile, brought up his own half-century off 45 balls — his slowest fifty of the IPL 2025 season. The previous slowest was Vijay Shankar’s 43-ball half-century against Delhi Capitals in Chennai. He scored 51 off 47 balls before being dismissed by Dushmantha Chameera.RCB spinners Suyash Sharma and Krunal Pandya may not have picked up many wickets, but they played a crucial role in keeping the Delhi Capitals batters in check and controlling the flow of runs.It was Krunal who got under Faf du Plessis's skin, building pressure and eventually claiming the prized wicket. Krunal finished with tidy figures of 4-0-28-1 and didn't allow KL Rahul to hit a single boundary during his spell.At the other end, Suyash shared the responsibility brilliantly, conceding just two boundaries in his four overs. He ended with figures of 4-0-22-0, with an impressive economy rate of 5.50.RCB’s chase never really got going the way they had hoped. They lost three wickets for just 26 runs in the first four overs, leaving Virat Kohli visibly frustrated at the other end.Jacob Bethell (12), Devdutt Padikkal (0), and Rajat Patidar (6) all fell cheaply. Axar Patel did the early damage, removing Bethell and then castling Padikkal for a duck in the same over to leave RCB reeling.However, what really infuriated Kohli was Patidar’s dismissal. After Kohli flicked one towards mid-wicket, Patidar set off for a single but hesitated midway as the fielder released a sharp throw. A direct hit from Karun Nair caught Patidar short of his crease, leading to a run-out that left Kohli visibly furious at the way Patidar threw his wicket away.After missing five matches due to a groin injury, Faf du Plessis returned to open the innings for Delhi Capitals. However, the move didn’t work in their favour. The 40-year-old managed just 22 runs off 26 balls before falling to Krunal Pandya.In all, this was Delhi Capitals’ fifth different opening combination this season — the most by any team. Chennai Super Kings, in comparison, have tried four opening pairs so far.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Delhi Capitals by six wickets. Virat Kohli (51 off 47) anchored the chase with a composed half-century.

Poll Do you think Liverpool can maintain their dominance in the league next season? It's too early to tell No, other teams will catch up Yes, they will continue to dominate

Liverpool secured their 20th English top-flight title with a stunning 5-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at an electrified Anfield on Sunday, sealing a record-equalling crown in emphatic style. The Reds, under manager Arne Slot, left no doubt as they turned an early deficit into a comprehensive win that saw them extend their lead to 15 points over second-placed Arsenal, making their title mathematically unassailable with just four games remaining.The match began with an air of anticipation, as Liverpool fans serenaded their team with the iconic ""You'll Never Walk Alone,"" and their team responded with attacking intent. However, Tottenham briefly threatened to spoil the party when Dominic Solanke powered home a header from a James Maddison corner in the 12th minute. The goal, which initially appeared to be offside, was awarded after VAR's intervention.The setback only seemed to galvanize Liverpool, who quickly leveled through Luis Diaz. The Colombian forward slotted home from close range following a fine cross from Dominik Szoboszlai. The home side then took the lead just minutes later, as Alexis Mac Allister rifled a thunderous shot past Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario in the 24th minute.Liverpool were rampant, and after Tottenham's inability to clear their lines, Cody Gakpo seized the opportunity to make it 3-1, firing a low shot into the corner. Spurs, fielding a weakened side due to manager Ange Postecoglou's focus on the Europa League semi-finals, were now on the back foot.As the second half progressed, the Liverpool faithful were craving a goal from their star man, Mohamed Salah. Their wish was granted when Salah collected a pass from Szoboszlai, cut inside, and blasted the ball into the bottom corner, celebrating by taking a selfie with a fan in front of the Kop. The crowd erupted in joyous chants, and the atmosphere at Anfield reached fever pitch.The final goal came when Tottenham defender Destiny Udogie inadvertently turned the ball into his own net, sealing a 5-1 rout and sending the Liverpool fans into a frenzy. As the final whistle blew, Anfield reverberated with deafening cheers, and the celebrations began in full force.Liverpool's triumph marked their 20th league title, bringing them level with Manchester United at the top of the all-time list. It also represented a significant achievement for manager Arne Slot, who has steered the club to glory in his first season after replacing Jurgen Klopp last year.","Liverpool secured their 20th English top-flight title with a stunning 5-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at an electrified Anfield on Sunday.

Sachin Tendulkar at 52: Power, Pride, and a Nation’s Pulse

The expression on captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni ’s face said it all as Chennai Super Kings suffered another defeat—this time a five-wicket loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Friday. A visibly disappointed Dhoni admitted that a total of 154 was far from “justifiable” on a Chepauk pitch that didn’t have any demons, as SRH dealt a near-fatal blow to CSK’s IPL 2025 play-off chances.Also See: DC vs RCB IPL Live Score Sunrisers chased down the modest target in just 18.4 overs.

For the skipper, the lack of cohesion in the team's overall effort was most frustrating.""I think we kept losing wickets and another thing is in the first innings the wicket was slightly better and 157 wasn't a justifiable score,"" Dhoni said after CSK’s loss.""It wasn't turning a lot, a little two-paced but nothing out of the ordinary. Yes, second innings there was a bit of help. Our spinners, the quality was there and they were bowling in the right areas, but we were 15-20 runs short,"" he added.Commenting on Dewald Brevis’ performance, Dhoni said, ""[On Brevis] I think he batted really well and we needed that in the middle order. When the spinners come in, you do it either by batsmanship or picking the right areas, but that's an area where we want to improve because middle overs are crucial.""Reflecting on the broader issues plaguing the team, Dhoni didn’t hold back.""In a tournament like this, if there are one or two areas to plug in the holes it's good, but when a majority of the players are not doing well you need to make changes. You can't just keep going. We are just not putting enough runs on the board,"" he said.With this win, SRH have moved up to eighth place on the points table, registering three wins and six losses for a total of six points.CSK, meanwhile, sit at the bottom with just two wins from nine games and only four points to show.","Chennai Super Kings lost by five wickets to Sunrisers Hyderabad on Friday.
