'Everyone knew': Sakshi Malik opens up about sex harassment in memoir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/everyone-knew-sakshi-malik-opens-up-about-sex-harassment-in-memoir/articleshow/114383392.cms,"Trouble had a way of finding me, writes retired wrestler Sakshi Malik in her memoir , 'Witness'. It found her at age 19 when fresh from winning gold at 2012 Asian Junior Championship at Kazakhstan's Almaty, Malik faced what she describes as one of the most traumatic experiences of her life.In the autobiography, Malik, who became the first Indian women wrestler to win a bronze at Rio Olympics , writes that she was taken to wrestling federation chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh 's hotel room after her win on pretext of speaking to her parents from Singh's mobile.She alleges, ""Singh connected me to my parents. It seemed harmless. When I spoke to them telling them about my match and my medal, I remember thinking that perhaps nothing unsavoury might happen after all. But right after I ended the call, he tried to molest me while I was seated on his bed. I pushed him off and started to cry.""She alleges, ""He stepped back after that. I think he realised that I wasn't going to go along with what he wanted. He started saying that he had put his arms around me 'papa jaise' (as a father would). But I knew that was not what it was. I ran out of his room all the way back to mine, weeping.""Malik and five other women wrestlers had staged a protest at Jantar Mantar in Jan 2023 accusing Singh of multiple incidents of sexual harassment. The wrestlers filed FIRs and in May this year, a Delhi court framed charges of sexual harassment , intimidation and outraging the modesty of women against Singh who is ex-Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief and six-time Lok Sabha MP. Singh has previously denied these allegations terming them a political conspiracy against him. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges in court. Singh did not respond to multiple calls and messages asking for a response to Malik's charges.In the memoir written with Jonathan Selvaraj, Malik says Singh made repeated calls urging her to ""stay in his favour"", offering facilities like protein supplements. Malik writes that she shared information about the Almaty incident with her camp roommate Anita Sheoran and her mother. ""Although I didn't intend to spread the story, it did. Everyone knew what happened with me at Almaty. No one spoke out about it. Neither did I.""Malik says fear and anxiety affected her performance at 2012 Junior World Championships a few months later where she was a favourite after winning a bronze in the previous edition. She ended up in 17th place. This was not the only occasion when Malik had to face sexual harassment, she says. She was assaulted by a tuition teacher when she went to his home to study. ""I had been molested in my childhood too, but for a long time I could not tell my family about it as I thought it was my fault. My tuition teacher used to harass me. He would call me over to his place for classes at odd times and sometimes tried to touch me. I was scared to go for my tuition classes but I could never tell my mom. This continued for a long time and I kept quiet about it,"" she writes.Malik finally opened up to her mother who was supportive of her. ""My mother supported me not just during the incident with the tuition teacher but also when Singh started pursuing me. I tried to forget about what had happened at Almaty. That's what my parents advised me to do too. They told me to focus on my training and competition. It doesn't seem like much today, but I was grateful that I was allowed to continue to train, at least.""","Sakshi Malik is the first Indian women wrestler to win a bronze at the Rio Olympics.

In Kansas City , high school football games are a beloved tradition, drawing NFL stars to the sidelines for a taste of community spirit. Recently, Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany took a break from their busy schedules to enjoy a game at Blue Valley, cheering on the sons of fellow coaches. However, amidst the excitement, the notable absence of Travis Kelce turned heads and ignited speculation.What could have kept the superstar tight end from joining his best friend Mahomes on such a special night?Also Read: NFL fans are noticing strange similarity between Andy Reid and Taylor Swift’s cat for an unexpected reason It’s not every day you see NFL superstars at a high school football game, but in Kansas City, it’s a cherished tradition. Patrick Mahomes, joined by his wife Brittany, took some time to watch the sons of coaches Matt Nagy and Dave Merritt play at Blue Valley. With Chiefs players like Chris Jones and head coach Andy Reid on the sidelines, Mahomes brought his son, Bronze, to share a special family moment.While NFL Sundays and college football Saturdays captivate fans, Mahomes chose to treat his son to some high school action during their bye week before the Chiefs face off against the 49ers. Brittany even shared a charming Instagram story of the duo at the game, captioned “Friday night lights.”Patrick Mahomes recently shared his joy on Instagram about continuing a beloved Kansas City tradition: attending high school football games. Flashing back to 2022, when he had just one Super Bowl title, Mahomes was spotted at Blue Valley with his wife, Brittany. When asked about his passion for these games, the Chiefs QB remarked,“I got to go to Ted’s son’s high school football game a couple of weeks back. I know you know Ted, he is our PR guy. His son, I’ve been here for six years now so I’ve seen him grow up and he’s starting in varsity so I went and watched him play.”In 2022, Mahomes attended games featuring QB coach Matt Nagy’s sons, one of whom played as starting QB while the other lined up at cornerback. “I went and watched Nagy’s sons. Luckily enough for me. Brittany loves sports as much as I do. So a couple of guys, we went out there and got to watch some high school football.” he added. (via: EssentiallySports)This week, Mahomes kept the tradition alive, but one notable absence turned heads: Travis Kelce, who skipped the game to join his best friend Mahomes and also missed his girlfriend's Eras Tour concert in Miami.Travis Kelce’s absence from Taylor Swift 's concert at the Blue Valley high school game surprised fans, especially after he had traveled the world to catch her on the Eras Tour. His no-show in Miami raised eyebrows about their relationship, despite recent sightings of the couple enjoying a lavish NYC dinner with Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively and sharing affectionate moments at a Yankees game.Adding to the intrigue, the entire Kelce family, including his mother Donna and brother Jason, were present at Hard Rock Stadium while Travis was missing. This was particularly significant as it marked Donna’s first live experience of Swift’s performance, even though Jason and his wife Kylie had previously attended her concerts.This rises the question: Is there more to the story behind Travis's absence, or is it just the latest gossip? As the couple continues to make headlines since their summer romance began in 2023, fans are eager for answers.Also Read: Is Hailee Steinfeld attending Bills’ Week 7 matchup against Titans to avoid a ‘Bad Omen’ with Josh Allen?","Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany attended a high school football game in Kansas City.

RANJI TROPHY: Round 2, Day 2

NEW DELHI: For all his success in international cricket, it's easy to forget that Washington Sundar started out as an opener when he first played for India U-19. His off-spin has been so consistent that batting has taken a backseat.On Saturday, when the opportunity was there to bat at No. 3 for Tamil Nadu, he made it count with a patient 152 off 269 as Tamil Nadu declared their first innings at 674/6 against Delhi in their Ranji Trophy match late on Day Two.The Kotla pitch had become a batting paradise. It looked a bit bizarre that Tamil Nadu continued batting at a slower rate compared to Day One for so long. Pradosh Ranjan Paul also helped himself to 117 off 175. Delhi's Sanat Sangwan and makeshift opener ensured Delhi didn't lose any wickets at stumps. But Washington was about driving home the point that he is a very capable top order bat.“I consider myself to be a top order batter ,” Washington was asser tive at the end of the day. “I am very happy with the kind of opportunity I got to be batting at No. 3. I will be batting regularly up the order in future. Hopefully, I can deliver such knocks consistently,” he said.This was Washington's second hundred in first-class cricket since he made his debut in 2017. He did come close to a Test hundred against England in Ahmedabad in 2021 when he was stranded on 96. He made no bones about the fact that it did play on his mind.“A hundred is a hundred. There are no two ways about it. I have been feeling very confident about how I have been batting in the last few years. I have just been trying to focus on what the team demands me to do. Batting at the top of the order is a lot of fun,” Washington said.He has largely been branded a white-ball specialist in international cricket. This knock will go a long way in building his reputation as a proper red-ball cricketer.GROUP A: In Mumbai: Maharashtra 126 & 142/1 (S Dhas 59*, Ruturaj Gaikwad 80*) trail Mumbai 441 (A Mhatre 176, S Iyer 142; Hitesh Valunj 6/134) by 173 runs.GROUP B: In Dharamshala: Rajasthan 1st innings: 334 (M Lomror 99; M Dagar 5/85) lead HP 1st innings: 98 (Deepak Chahar 5/30) and 2nd innings: 147/2 (Manav Suthar 2/40) by 89 runs.

Sarfaraz proves he is no longer an afterthought or a replacement but a worthy contender in his own right for a more stable Test berth

India vs New Zealand Test: Focus returns on India batters after high-scoring day

BENGALURU: There weren't many takers for his unconventional batting style. He was often body-shamed for his stocky build. He silenced his critics by burying them under an avalanche of runs. Yet, given India's batting riches, Sarfaraz Khan had to wait until Feb this year to earn the white flannels.Three Tests, 200 runs at an average of 50 and an unbeaten double century for Mumbai in the Irani Cup recently did not seal his place in the playing XI.It was instead a neck injury to Shubman Gill that handed the 26-year-old another opportunity. For almost five hours over two days, it felt like Sarfaraz's bat was saying, ""Stop me if you can."" The Black Caps pulled every trick out of the bag but failed to stop the Mumbaikar until the seam of the second new ball did him in.A child prodigy whose international career bloomed late, it is hard to compartmentalise the 26-year-old's game. He is often unconventional but extremely effective.Sarfaraz brought up his maiden ton with a backfoot punch off Tim Southee . He immediately launched into an animated yet emotional celebration. It was an innings that will be remembered for ages for the circumstances and the extreme pressure under which he came out to bat.""The innings felt good since it was my maiden century playing for India. I'm very happy because I've dreamt of this day since childhood,"" said an elated Sarfaraz. For someone who has dealt with disappointment from a young age, the composure in Sarfaraz is refreshing. Asked about handling disappointments, he said, ""I just keep following the same process.""""I've been scoring runs for the last four to five years. I focus on the things under my control, do well in training and try to overcome the shortcomings. Also, I talk to my father often and he keeps me motivated.""Sarfaraz said that the match is far from over. ""It isn't an easy wicket to bat on. I don't think the game is out of our hands yet. The ball is still cutting in and out. If we manage to get two to three wickets early on, they could be in trouble.""The highlight of the day was the partnership Sarfaraz had with Rishabh Pant , his teammate from India U-19 days.""We were planning on playing attacking cricket. During the Duleep Trophy recently, we had a similar scenario where we had to counter-attack in the second innings. We followed the same thought process here as well,"" Sarfaraz said.","Sarfaraz proves he is no longer an afterthought or a replacement but a worthy contender in his own right for a more stable Test berth.

Kiwis 107 runs away from long-awaited win

India vs New Zealand Test: Focus returns on India batters after high-scoring day

BENGALURU: Rohit Sharma and Co. are staring down the barrel against New Zealand in the opening Test and will have to pull off a Houdini act on Sunday. Set a paltry target of 107, the visitors played out four deliveries from Jasprit Bumrah before bad light, followed by rain, ended play on the fourth day on Saturday.If New Zealand can pull this off on the fifth day, this will be their first Test win in India in 36 years.Their last win, by 136 runs, came at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai way back in 1988.A defeat may cost India vital World Test Championship (WTC) points, but the gains for the hosts have also been plenty. It needs guts and gumption to post 462 second innings runs in 99.3 overs at a run rate of 4.64 after being bowled out for 46 in the first innings.For the better part of India's second innings, a clear, positive mindset was on display. While Rohit (52) and Virat Kohli (70) put crucial runs on the board, the hosts' stirring comeback was scripted by Sarfaraz Khan (150; 195b, 18x4, 3x6) and Rishabh Pant (99, 105b; 9x4; 5x6) with their massive 177-run association for the fourth wicket.With three Test matches to his credit, Sarfaraz is the most inexperienced in the lineup. On the other hand, Pant, who survived a career-threatening accident, is playing his thirdTest match since his comeback from a 22-month Test hiatus.When Kohli was dismissed off the last ball on Day 3, India were 231/3 with a 125-run deficit. Sarfaraz, who found sweet spots in the third man region, got down to business in the second over of the day with a fine cut off William O'Rourke (3/92).It marked the beginning of an association between two talents born less than three weeks apart. Given the duo's flair for expansive shots and bold strokes, it was hardly surprising that they flirted with danger. That said, the risks taken were also well-calculated. They took some smart reviews and survived close calls as well. While Sarfaraz converted his maiden 100 into 150 effortlessly, Pant brought up his half-century with a boundary off Glenn Philips.While Sarfaraz was happy to take on the pacers with his delectable late cuts, Pant unleashed his slog sweeps. He also tackled spin adroitly. A 99-minute rain delay did not hamper the tempo. With runs coming from both ends, the New Zealand attack was all at sea until the second new ball changed the scenario.Taken immediately after the 80th over, the second new-ball sparked an unexpected collapse. The first to go was Sarfaraz, who miscued a cover drive off a Tim Southee delivery that seamed away to Ajaz Patel. There was no sign of nerves from Pant in the 90s, especially not after he went down on his knees to send a Southee delivery out of the stadium. But O'Rourke, brought back into the attack, had the southpaw's number bowling around the wicket.Pant's intended drive saw him drag the ball onto the stumps and stunned the 20,000-odd people in the stands into complete silence.KL Rahul managed 12 before his lack of confidence got the better of him. Off a short of a length delivery from O'Rourke, Rahul's indecisiveness resulted in him offering an edge to Tom Blundell. It didn't take the Kiwis long to mop up the tail.","Kiwis 107 runs away from long-awaited win against India in opening Test.

NAGPUR: After a superb comeback scripted by Yash Rathod and Harsh Dubey on Day 1, elements of nature proved a dampener on Day 2 of Vidarbha-Puducherry Elite Group 'B' Ranji Trophy match. Intermittent rain, wet outfield, and bad light allowed only 29 overs to be bowled at the Cricket Association of Puducherry 's Siechem Stadium on Saturday.The rain-curtailed Day 2 saw Vidarbha 's first innings ending on 283, an addition of 22 runs to overnight score, in 96.5 overs.Host Puducherry's reply began on a shaky note with left-arm spinner Harsh Dubey sending opener Ajay Rohera back with the scoreboard reading 10 in 5.4 overs. Other opener Akash Kargave (23*;42b;3x4) and Parameeshwaran S (14*;35b;2x4) averted any further damage as bad light brought an early end to day's play with Puducherry on 45 for 1 in 15 overs, still 238 runs short of Vidarbha's first innings total.With more rain predicted over the next two days, Vidarbha team management sources reckon that securing the first innings lead is the only plausible outcome the match offers.Earlier, wet outfield and intermittent rain resulted in almost one-and-half sessions being washed out on Day 2. Vidarbha's overnight unbeaten ninth wicket pair of Harsh Dubey and Aditya Thakare started cautiously when play finally resumed late into the second session. They scored 12 runs in the first 10.4 overs of the day.Dubey, starting on 69, managed to add only seven runs to his overnight score and was the first Vidarbha wicket to fall on Saturday. Dubey's 76 run-knock (183b;9x4), his highest in First Class cricket, was instrumental in guiding Vidarbha to a respectable total.The last wicket pair of Aditya Thakare and Akshay Wakhare lasted for 20 balls as Vidarbha's first innings ended on 283 with the departure of Wakhare (8;16b;1x4). Thakare remained unbeaten, having faced 44 balls for his 11 run-knock.Vidarbha: 283 all out in 96.5 overs (Yash Rathod 118, Harsh Dubey 76, Akshay Wadkar 31; Gourav Yadav 4-65, Sagar Udeshi 2-45, Fabid Ahmed 2-51; Aman Khan 2-44) lead Puducherry: 45 for 1 in 15 overs (Akash Kargave 23 batting, Parameeshwaran S 14 batting; Harsh Dubey 1-15) by 238 runs.","Day 2 of Vidarbha-Puducherry Elite Group 'B' Ranji Trophy match was washed out due to bad light and intermittent rain.

Deepak Chahar must be mighty pleased with the way his body is responding and add to it his impact with the ball. On Day Two, the 32-year-old bowled 10 overs straight and scythed through Himachal Pradesh 's top-order to claim his fifth five-wicket haul, 5-30, in First Class cricket for Rajasthan during an Elite Group B Ranji Trophy match in Dharamshala on Saturday. Himachal eventually folded for 98 in 30 overs.The skilled swing bowler, who has just recovered from a hamstring injury, castled three players - Ankit Kalsi (6 off 9 balls), Ekant Sen (0 off 6 balls) and Abhinandan Bhardwaj (10 off 10 balls).As fast bowlers dictated the terms, Deepak was joined by seasoned left-arm seamer Aniket Chouhary who cleaned up the tail, recording figures of 9-1-28-3. While both Khaleel Ahmed and Arafat Khan chipped in with a wicket each.In the driver's seat, captain Deepak Hooda enforced the follow-on and Himachal came out to bat again, looking better equipped to tackle the seamers. The pitch got easier to bat on and their openers Shubham Arora (59 off 79 balls) and Prashant Chopra (49 off 94 balls) gave them a fine start, stitching a partnership of 103 runs. But this time left-arm spinner Manav Suthar impeded their progress. The Rajasthan youngster cleaned up the Himachal openers and at stumps the hosts were 147/2, trailing by 89 runs with Ankit and Ekant at the crease.Earlier, Rajasthan added 30 more runs in 8.3 overs to their overnight score of 304/7.

Ton-up Raj Bawa 's all-round performance on Day 2 helped visiting Chandigarh take the upper hand against hosts Assam in their second-round match of Ranji Trophy Elite Group D in Guwahati on Saturday.The young right-arm medium pacer first took two remaining Assam wickets in the morning session before turning up the heat with the bat to notch up his maiden first-class century which helped Chandigarh finish the day on 301/5 from 78 overs.In the process, Chandigarh also took the all-important first innings lead at Barsapara Cricket Stadium , thereby ensuring three points from the game. Captain Manan Vohra (59) and Mayank Sidhu helped Bawa with valuable half-centuries at the other end.The 21-year-old left-handed batter is unbeaten on 122 from 132 balls hitting seven fours and eight sixes. Wicketkeeper-batter Sidhu is giving Bawa company at the crease, batting on 54. The duo put on 147 for the unbeaten sixth wicket stand which took Chandigarh to safety after they were put in a spot of bother by the Assam bowlers, losing five wickets with 154 on board.However, the Bawa-Sidhu partnership made sure Chandigarh broke no sweat to surpass Assam's first innings total. But at the same time the home side should be blamed for letting Chandigarh batters off the hook after raising hopes of restricting them from reaching their score easily.Earlier, Assam could add only 17 to their overnight score of 249/8 to end their innings on 266 as Sumit Ghadigaonkar failed to add anything to his overnight score of 41. He was the first man to go, returning in the first ball of the second over of the day bowled by Bawa. In his next over, Bawa scalped No. 11 Rahul Singh for nought. Only Mrinmoy Dutta scored 15 off 12 with a four and a six for Assam.In reply, Chandigarh had a decent start but barring Vohra none of the top order batters could convert their starts. Losing wickets at regular intervals saw Chandigarh being reduced to 154/5 in 45th over. However, Sidhu and Bawa thwarted any further damage.Assam's Dutta and Rahul Singh took two wickets apiece while Mukhtar Hussain scalped Vohra.Assam 266 in 90.2 overs (Sumit Ghadigaonkar 41; Raj Bawa 3-57). Chandigarh 301/5 in 78 overs (Manan Vohra 59, Raj Bawa 122 batting, Mayank Sidhu 54 batting; Mrinmoy Dutta 2-57, Rahul Singh 2-98).

"Ranji Trophy: Shreyas Iyer ends century drought, but Gaikwad helps Maharashtra fight back",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ranji-trophy-shreyas-iyer-ends-century-drought-but-gaikwad-helps-maharashtra-fight-back/articleshow/114379713.cms,"(PTI Photo)

MUMBAI: Shreyas Iyer ended his three-year century drought at the Sharad Pawar Cricket Academy in BKC slamming his 14th first-class hundred (142, 190b, 12x4, 4x6), but, leading his team's fabulous fightback by example, Maharashtra captain Ruturaj Gaikwad cracked a strokeful, unbeaten 80 (72b, 12x4, 1x6) to take his team to 142 for one in the second innings on an eventful Day Two of the Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match here.Coming in to bat at No 3, Gaikwad, who is likely to lead India A on the tour of Australia soon, put his first innings duck behind in style, adding 141 in 184 balls in an unfinished partnership for the second wicket with opener Sachin Dhas (59 not out, 112 balls, 7x4, 1x6), after Maharashtra, staring at defeat when the last session began, suffered a blow right at the start when opener Siddhesh Veer fell for a two-ball duck to Shardul Thakur. Having come close to taking a hat-trick in the first over of the match on Day One with his twin strikes, the pace-bowling allrounder was again breathing fire when Gaikwad arrived at the crease.While Dhas was sold while scoring his maiden first-class fifty, Gaikwad was all class, showcasing a series of exquisite drives, pulls and cuts and late cuts to reach his half-century, which came with a single to mid-off off Shams Mulani, and contained eight fours and a huge six. The way the Chennai Super Kings captain dominated the Mumbai bowlers - particularly Mulani who conceded 0-60 in his 10 overs - on Saturday, reflected why the national selectors have some much faith in Gaikwad's special ability.So determined is Gaekwad to finish the task, which looks quite uphill at the moment, that he didn't even celebrate his fifty-in stark contrast to the warm scenes in the afternoon when Iyer was hugged by Suryakumar Yadav (7, caught at short mid-wicket after miscuing a slog-sweep off Walunj) after the latter reached his 14th first-class hundred, which came off 131 balls.Even Iyer seemed to be in awe of Gaikwad's glittering strokeplay. ""He has been batting phenomenally. He is a great timer of the ball, as we all know,"" the India batsman quipped, before hoping that Mumbai would make a breakthrough soon on Day Three morning.""It's just a matter of one wicket. I feel once the ball starts turning, and I hope that from tomorrow onwards it will, because even when we were batting one, the odd ball was turning, and there were a few signs (of turn on the pitch). I hope that we get them all out tomorrow,"" he said.In a bit of concern for Mumbai, Iyer left the field for the remaining part of the day after hurting his hand while trying to take a catch that Dhas offered at first slip off Mohit Awashi, while batting on none in the sixth over.Earlier, after play began at 10am due to overnight rain, 17-year-old opener Ayush Mhatre top-scored for Mumbai with 176 (232b, 22x4, 4x6) as Mumbai's innings finally ended at 441, which left Maharashtra trailing by a massive margin of 315 runs. Mhatre's marathon innings ended when he was caught at short mid-wicket off Walunj. Bowling his heart out, the visitors' left-arm spinner Hitesh Walunj finished with six for 134 after toiling for 36.1 overs.Praising Mhatre later, Iyer said, ""Ayush is a tremendous talent. I feel the energy and the attitude that he has portrayed today in the game, batting for so long and then coming and fielding at silly point and short leg, shows the character of the player. When you see him diving around on the field, you know how much craving he's got from inside to put in his full effort.""Even though they are still ahead in the match by some distance, with Maharashtra trailing by 173 runs, Mumbai's bowlers, particularly their proven quality spinners Mulani and Kotian, would need to pull their socks up to wrap up this match, ideally with a bonus point, which is much needed since they suffered a stunning 84-run defeat in their opening match of the 2024-25 Ranji Trophy season.","Mumbai batsman Shreyas Iyer scores his 14th first-class hundred. Maharashtra captain Ruturaj Gaikwad scores unbeaten 80 to take his team to 142 for one in the second innings. Ayush Mhatre top-scored for Mumbai with 176 (232b, 22x4, 4x6)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114379954,imgsize-28668,width-400,resizemode-4/114379954.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket fans finally witnessed a moment they had been waiting for. Star batter Virat Kohli signalled a return to form in Test cricket with a well-crafted 70-run knock in the second innings of the first Test against New Zealand in Bengaluru on Friday.It was a knock that held immense importance, both on a personal level and considering the match situation.It marked his first Test fifty of 2024, and the timing of his 31st in the longest format couldn't have been more crucial - in every sense.He took 15 balls to get off the mark but once he settled in, it was a vintage Kohli, showcasing his impeccable timing and grace, executing a flawless cover drive off the bowling of pacer William O'Rourke.However, before this knock, Kohli appeared far from his best. His dwindling run in the longest format of the game was the talking point in the cricketing circles.Kohli's perennial struggle against outside-off deliveries from pacers and off-spinners continued to haunt him, as he often fell victim while chasing those expansive drives.His return to Test format against Bangladesh last month did little to change his fortunes as the batting maestro managed scores of just 6 and 17 in the two innings of the first Test in Chennai. However, he seemed to have regained the mojo back with the scores of 47 and unbeaten 29 in the second Test in Kanpur.In the first innings of the opening Test against New Zealand, Kohli once again found himself in trouble, falling to William O'Rourke, who surprised him with extra bounce, leading to his dismissal as he was caught at gully.Having been out of form in Test cricket, Kohli showed that he is still a force to reckon with and cannot be written off in India's Test campaign over the next four months.He will now need to keep his momentum in the remaining two Tests against New Zealand before heading to Australia for the five-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.Kohli's career Test average stands at 48.74, but the numbers indicate that he particularly enjoys batting against Australia on their home turf. In 13 matches, he has scored 1,352 runs at an impressive average of 54.08, well above his career average.Will Kohli be key in leading India to a third consecutive series win Down Under? Only time will tell. But if the stats are any indication, Australia could be in for a tough time facing Kohli.In four Tests this year, including the ongoing match with New Zealand, Kohli has managed to score just 227 runs across eight innings at an average of 32.42, with a solitary fifty.Since the launch of the World Test Championship in 2019, Kohli's batting has experienced a significant decline, placing him 13th on the list of most runs scored in the WTC with 2404 runs from 39 matches at a mediocre average of 38.77.In the current ICC World Test Championship 2023-25, he has scored 538 runs in 12 innings over seven matches, averaging 48.90. During this period, he has recorded one century and three fifties, with a highest score of 121.The start of the 2020s decade has not been ideal for Kohli in Test cricket. In 32 Tests during this period, he has amassed 1815 runs in 56 innings at an average of 32.92, including two centuries and eight fifties, with a highest score of 186.However, last year was exceptional for Kohli, as he scored both of his centuries and amassed 671 runs in eight matches at an impressive average of 55.91.In their quest for their maiden WTC title, India will rely on Kohli to continue his form in the upcoming matches against New Zealand and Australia.","Virat Kohli scored 70 in India's second innings of first Test against New Zealand. It was his first Test fifty of 2024 and his 31st in the longest format of the game. Kohli's career Test average stands at 48.74, but the numbers indicate that he particularly enjoys batting against Australia.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114379411,imgsize-43400,width-400,resizemode-4/114379411.jpg"

Kolkata : The colour of the big derby remains green and maroon and the script is getting predictable and repetitive.

MANCHESTER (England): Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund got on the scoresheet as Manchester United bounced back after conceding a controversial goal to beat Brentford 2-1 at Old Trafford on Saturday for their first victory in more than a month.The win meant United climbed to 10th in the standings on 11 points after eight matches, and eased some of the pressure on beleaguered manager Erik ten Hag, whose job has been the subject of media speculation.Brentford are 12th on 10 points.United had 10 men on the pitch when Ethan Pinnock headed in Brentford's goal from a corner deep in first-half stoppage time after referee Sam Barrott instructed Matthijs de Ligt to go to the touchline to stem the bleeding from a gash on his head.The decision had Ten Hag and assistant Ruud van Nistelrooy shouting at the fourth official.But it seemed to fire up the home side, who dominated Brentford in a spirited second half, and Garnacho latched onto a cross from Marcus Rashford to fire home from the left side of the six-yard box into the far corner in the 47th minute.Hojlund put the home side ahead in spectacular fashion in the 62nd when Bruno Fernandes found him with a back-heel pass, and the Dane chipped the ball over goalkeeper Mark Flekken for his first league goal of the season.United had not won a game since a 7-0 League Cup rout of Barnsley on Sept. 17, and had not won a league game since a 3-0 victory at last-placed Southampton on Sept. 14.Brentford had scored inside the first two minutes in their previous four league matches. Kevin Schade had one of the visitors' best chances of the game in the third minute, but he could not quite get to Vitaly Janelt's ball into the box.Brentford's Christian Norgaard also forced Andre Onana into a spectacular diving save in the first half.""We were the best team in the (first) half. Definitely opposite second half, disappointed second half that we were not able to do better. We knew of course they were going to come out flying, we were way too passive,"" Brentford coach Thomas Frank said.The best chances otherwise belonged to United, including Christian Eriksen firing over the net. Ten Hag's men had 11 shots on target to Brentford's two.The win came a day after Ten Hag called speculation about his job baseless, saying that the club's management were on the same page.",Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund get on the scoresheet as Manchester United beat Brentford 2-1.

On Friday, 10-man BFC defended with all their might in for more than 30 minutes to hold on to their 1-0 lead and take full points against Punjab FC at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium here.It was their fourth win of the season, that helped them grab a four-point lead at the top, thanks to Roshan Singh’s first-half strike in a feisty contest, which saw tackles flying in thick and fast right from the start.Punjab’s plan was quite evident early on, to have a crack at goal whenever a chance arrived in the top of the table clash. Their first real attempt came in the sixth minute when midfielder Nikhil Prabhu tried to surprise home goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu from the halfway line. It was an easy grab and a few minutes later skipper Filip Mrzljak tried another from outside the box. There were some other audacious long rangers too in the first half.Despite the lion’s share of possession in the first 25 minutes, Bengaluru FC, in their pink kit, did not even test the visitors goalkeeper Ravi Kumar. Their best move came in the 20th minute when Roshan’s strike inside the box was tackled by the Punjab defenders, who were on their toes once again after Suresh Singh’s effort met a similar fate.But they finally broke the deadlock after Pereyra Diaz’s cross found Roshan inside the box and he smashed it home in the 43rd minute. There was a sigh of relief in the BFC bench, which had a pensive look until then.Early in the second half, a beautiful team move that involved Sunil Chhetri, who came off from the bench in place of Rohit Danu, almost resulted in a goal with Alberto Noguera’s shot missing the target from outside the box.With around half an hour left to play, Bengaluru defender Chinglensana Konsham was sent off for his second yellow. It was a test of character for the home team from then on with Punjab enjoying more possession.One man down and the tables turned with Bengaluru defending in numbers. Even when they received the ball, there were not many players in space upfront to make the run.Punjab came close to an equaliser when Mushaga Bakenga’s strike hit the bar in the 74th minute.

England should have an English coach: Gary Neville,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/england-should-have-an-english-coach-gary-neville/articleshow/114366224.cms,"You are famously a one-club man. What made you stick with Manchester United?

You played for Manchester United at a time when they were the best team in the world. Right now, that’s not the case…

United had their worst start after seven rounds in the Premier League. Is there a way back?

Erik ten Hag was close to getting the sack last season but survived. Was that the right move?

If Ten Hag fails to force a turnaround quickly, do you think his position is in danger?

You have been critical of Thomas Tuchel, a foreigner, being appointed England manager…

(Gary Neville was in Chandigarh for the initiative on behalf of Apollo Tyres)

CHANDIGARH: Famously a one-club man at Manchester United , Gary Neville won eight Premier League titles and two UEFA Champions League crowns. In Chandigarh for the finale of the ‘ United We Play ’ initiative, the former right-back with 85 England caps spoke exclusively to TOI about United’s problems, Erik ten Hag’s future, and why he’s been critical of a foreigner taking over as England manager.Excerpts…I don’t criticise players for switching clubs. I played at the club that I loved and supported. We were successful and I never wanted to play anywhere else. But that’s easy for me. If you look at players that move, they do so to either to get a better salary or they move to play for a better club and further their career. I didn’t need to do that. I didn’t need to go and get a better salary. I didn’t need to go and play for a different club because the club that I wanted to play for was already there. So I don’t criticise players for their lack of loyalty to the clubs that they grew up with.I think, sometimes, football and life is about cycles. Obviously at this moment Manchester City and Liverpool are very successful. Arsenal are getting better. Manchester United, obviously over the last 10 years, have had their challenges. It’s been a big, big problem overcoming the loss of David Gill and Sir Alex Ferguson. But I am more enthused by what’s happened in the last twelve months with the fact that there has been a disruption in the ownership. There’s been a lot of changes behind the scenes at the club, and I’m hopeful that given time, the football department with Dan Ashworth, Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox can bring success in the next three to five years.It’s been hugely disappointing. I don’t think anybody expected this. You’ve got to hope that coming out of the international break, there is a reset, there’s a recalibration of sorts, there’s a change in mentality. Good performances are needed in the next few weeks.I could sense at the end of last season, after the FA Cup victory, and with the change in the structure of the club, that United will persist with Erik Ten Hag. I think a lot of people and United fans, wanted Erik to stay. A lot of people thought with a really successful transfer window, we could go on to have a very successful season this year. That could still happen.No doubt there’s pressure. In England, there’s big media pressure and the scrutiny is gruelling. Some results are needed. It seems to me that the ownership, and particularly Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS, are looking at it in a more strategic way, with a patient approach. There’s no doubt they will want big improvements in the next few weeks in (terms of) performances and results.To say ‘being quite critical’ doesn’t sound right. I’m a great fan of international investment into our country. I’m a great fan of international people coming and working in our country. I just think that England should have an English coach because it’s our national team. We’ve tried obviously having international coaches before in SvenGoran Eriksson and Fabio Capello, and I feel Gareth Southgate did a very good job. We have some talented English coaches like Graham Potter and Eddie Howe, who could have potentially taken the job.","Gary Neville was in Chandigarh for the finale of the ‘ United We Play ’ initiative.

But on Thursday, Chennaiyin FC made sure of bringing the fans at home the gift of the second win of the season, despite another late fightback from NorthEast United FC In the end, the Highlanders supporters could not witness an encore of their point-yielding late show of the last two games as 10-man Chennaiyin held their fort and snatched away a 3-2 Indian Super League win at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium in Guwahati.Former NEUFC recruit Wilmar Jordan Gill (25’, 51’) made an impressive comeback into Owen Coyle ’s starting XI this season with a crucial brace from set-pieces on either side of Lucas Brambilla’s (36’) goal from the spot despite NEUFC making a dream start with a 5th-minute opener by Nestor Albiach.Juan Pedro Benali’s men also came hard at the visitors in quest for at least a point after Laldinliana Renthlei was sent off the field for a second yellow card in the 83rd minute.Their wonder recruit Alaeddine Ajaraie was once again on the scoresheet – becoming only the second player after Chennaiyin’s former star striker Elano Blumer to score in all his first five games in ISL – when he put the ball in the opposition net from a confident penalty kick.However, Ajaraie, who was brilliant throughout the game but also missed a couple of sitters, was not able to add further to the score thereafter as Chennaiyin strived to maintain the one-goal lead to take away all three points on offer.The victory took Coyle’s side to the fifth spot with seven points from four matches – a jump of three spots on the ISL table. It also sent NEUFC down three places to the ninth position, with just four points from the five matches they have played so far.","Chennaiyin FC beat NorthEast United FC 3-2 at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium in Guwahati.

Akanksha shocks Vaishnavi to enter final in Bengaluru ITF event,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/akanksha-shocks-vaishnavi-to-enter-final-in-bengaluru-itf-event/articleshow/114380132.cms,"Akanksha Nitture in action during her semifinal win over Vaishnavi Adkar in Bengaluru on Saturday

Akanksha Nitture stunned second seed Vaishnavi Adkar to set up an all-Indian final against Tanisha Kashyap in the $15,000 ITF women's tennis event in Bengaluru on Saturday.In a match of see-sawing fortunes, Mumbai girl Akanksha overcame ebb and flow in her own form as well as a three-hour rain interruption to beat Pune's Vaishnavi 7-5, 3-6, 6-2 in the semifinals of the hard court event.Tanisha pulled off an upset of her own in the other semifinal at the KSLTA stadium , beating fourth seed Carolann Delaunay of New Caledonia 6-1, 7-5.Akanksha, who reached the quarterfinals last week in Mysuru, remained in contention in doubles as well.The 21-year-old and local girl Soha Sadiq, the reigning National champions, were leading 5-4 against Russia's Arina Arifullina and Jo-Leen Saw of Malaysia when rain returned to suspend play for the day.The winners will face top seeds Humera Baharmus and Pooja Ingale, who powered into the final with a 7-6 (2), 6-4 victory over Sai Samhitha and Diva Bhatia.Akanksha came out with her guns blazing from the get-go, troubling her rival, who is yet to fully recover from chikungunya, with her big serves, deep returns and clever drop shots, which Vaishnavi, also suffering from an abdominal strain, made any effort to get to.Despite the limitations and icing her swollen knee during the changeovers, she troubled Akanksha with her power-packed ground strokes, coming up with winners off both flanks.Vaishnavi broke back in the eighth and 10th games to level at 5-5. But before much damage could be done, Akanksha stepped up her game a notch to close out the set in the 12th game.She broke Vaishnavi's serve in the first game of the second set before the heavens opened up.The three-hour delay seemed to break Akanksha's momentum. The second seed didn't let that affect her as she began to dictate terms and took the issue to the decider.She wasn't the same player in the final set, as she was broken in the fourth game, serving a double fault at breakpoint.Akanksha, whose previous best was a semifinal appearance in Ahmedabad two years ago, didn't prolong her rival's agony, closing out the match by breaking Vaishnavi's serve again in the eighth game.","Akanksha Nitture beat Pune's Vaishnavi Adkar 7-5, 3-6, 6-2 in the semifinals of the hard court event.

"Odisha’s Aahan, 14, comes of age with National junior tennis titles",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/odishas-aahan-14-comes-of-age-with-national-junior-tennis-titles/articleshow/114255070.cms,"PUNE: Aahan discovered tennis in an unsual way.“You know the Wimbledon matches, US Open, Australian Open, all those,” Aahan said in the tone of a child sharing a wonderment.“When I was small, I used to watch tennis videos. Every kid watches cartoons, right? But I didn’t watch cartoons. I just used to watch sports, tennis specially.“So, my parents were like, ‘she likes it.We have to put her on to that’. So my uncle, he knows tennis coaches. But when I started at the age of 3, the coach was like ‘no, she’s small. She can’t play, she cannot understand anything'.“But I was happy to play tennis, and I was interested in playing tennis.”That was a decade ago, in Mendhasala in Odisha Now 14, not a grown-up yet, Aahan announced her arrival on the big stage by claiming a double crown, the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week.It gets ever more incredible when you consider that she entered the Under-16 event as a qualifier and went all the way. Besides, she also played doubles in U-16, losing in the second round though.In the U-16 final, Aahan beat Aishwarya Jadhav , the eighth seeded Maharashra girl against whom she has a 1-1 head to head in the ITF juniors circuit. Aishwarya, two years older than the Odisha girl, had won her first juniors title in a Grade 5 tournament in Ahmedabad recently.“I’m happy, but it was very tough,” Aahan, who is currently coached by Santosh Malik, said.“Each and every round was tough. But I was just focused on each and every point. Like, I want to win this point, and next point, like that. So I was fully focused and my target was (to) win both the tournaments.So, I tried my best and the rest is the result (two titles).”Aahan’s first coach was Ajay Nishank, under whose tutelage she was until a year ago when she started working with Malik. She also has access to the Abhinav Bindra Targeting Performance (ABTP) centre in Bhubaneswar, where she is one of the athletes from various disciplines who get free fitness training under a programme by the Odisha state government ’s department of sports.She, along with Tavish Pahwa, was a part of the Asian junior team that was picked for an European exposure trip under the Grand Slam Player Development Programme of the ITF earlier this year.“In Europe, it was tough matches and I was a little bit nervous. But when I started winning matches, then I started to feel confident, like ‘yeah, I can beat them’,” she said.Aahan, while brimming with confidence and optimism, is also aware which areas of her game she has to improve.“I have to improve my serve and forehand. And a little bit in volleys,” she said.“I’m good in volleys. When I play doubles, I do good volleys. But in singles I have to do better because, you know, in singles that is tough. You have to cover the full court.“Like, if the opponent is giving you a lob, you have to cover that. You have to be confident, ‘yeah, I can do this. So I’ll go (up) front’.”For a youngster of her age, Aahan has remarkable clarity of what her long terms goals are and how to get there.“Yeah, in ITF, I want to be in top 100, so I can play the WTA (Tour events). In juniors, if I get in top 100, I’ll get a chance to play junior slams like the Australia open or US Open Junior slam.“Then, I can learn and work more on that thing, and then I’ll collect the points in ITF. Then I can play the Slams.”","Aahan won the Under-14 and Under-16 girls’ singles titles at the Fenesta Open National championships in New Delhi last week.

His title in Shanghai was his seventh of the year.""He's very solid from the forehand and backhand, doesn't make too many mistakes, and just tries to take away the time from the opponent,"" said Djokovic.""That's something that reminds me of myself throughout my career, that's what I've done for so many years consistently, playing fast-paced tennis , taking away time from the opponent, kind of suffocating the opponent in a certain way.""","Novak Djokovic says he plans ""to compete and play next season"" The Serb lost 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 to Jannik Sinner in the final of the Shanghai Masters.
