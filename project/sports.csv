Six Indians in ICC T20 World Cup 'Team of the Tournament'; Virat Kohli misses out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/six-indians-in-icc-t20-world-cup-team-of-the-tournament-virat-kohli-misses-out/articleshow/111393688.cms,"ICC Team of The Tournament

12th man:

NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has announced its ' Team of the Tournament ' for the recently concluded T20 World Cup. Despite playing a key role in India's victory over South Africa in the final, star batter Virat Kohli did not find a place in this select squad.India clinched their second T20 World Cup title, defeating South Africa by seven runs in a thrilling climax.Kohli, who was promoted to opener for the tournament, had a relatively quiet World Cup until the grand finale, where he produced a match-winning knock of 76 runs off 59 balls and was named the player of the match. Despite his heroics, Kohli was omitted from the ICC XI.The ICC’s lineup featured six Indian players, reflecting their strong overall performance. Indian skipper Rohit Sharma , Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah , and Arshdeep Singh were all included. Rohit led from the front, amassing 257 runs at an impressive strike rate of 156.7, making him the second-highest run-scorer behind Afghanistan's Rahmanullah Gurbaz.One of the standout performers, Jasprit Bumrah, was named Player of the Tournament. Bumrah took 15 wickets and more importantly, his ability to restrict the scoring rate made him India's trump card. His economy rate of 4.17 was the best recorded by a bowler in a single edition of the men's T20 World Cup.Following a historic semi-final finish, PTI has reported that Afghanistan had three players making it to the ICC team. Left-arm quick Fazalhaq Farooqi topped the wicket-taking charts alongside India’s Arshdeep Singh with 17 wickets each. Wicketkeeper-batter Rahmanullah Gurbaz, who led the run charts with 281 runs, and captain Rashid Khan were the other inclusions from Afghanistan.Skipper Rashid Khan led Afghanistan brilliantly, claiming 14 wickets at an economy of 6.17, showcasing his prowess as both a leader and a player.Australian all-rounder Marcus Stoinis and West Indies’ Nicholas Pooran rounded out the XI, bringing additional balance to the team.South Africa, despite being the runners-up, did not have a player in the XI. However, pacer Anrich Nortje was named the 12th man.Overall, the ICC's 'Team of the Tournament' reflects a mix of individual brilliance and consistent performance across the event, highlighting the standout players who made a significant impact.Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh (all Indians); Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Rashid Khan, Fazalhaq Farooqi (Afghanistan); Marcus Stoinis (Australia) and Nicholas Pooran (West Indies);Anrich Nortje.","The International Cricket Council (ICC) has announced its'Team of the Tournament'for the recently concluded T20 World Cup.

WWE Money in the Bank 2024: Predictions for Seth Rollins vs Damian Priest World Title Match,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/wwe-money-in-the-bank-2024-predictions-for-seth-rollins-vs-damian-priest-world-title-match/articleshow/111412006.cms,"WWE Money in the Bank 2024 could witness Seth Rollins' new rise at the cost of Damian Priest

The contest between Seth Rollins and Damian Priest , scheduled at the WWE Money in the Bank 2024 , could well become the discussion point for the entire community. After all, it's not just an ordinary title match, as there's more at stake. Rollins and Priest have a ""gentleman's agreement"" between them, and it could undoubtedly have a significant effect on the outcome of the clash.When required, Damian Priest managed to stand tall and apart from the remaining members of Judgment Day.He might be carrying the World Heavyweight Championship on his shoulders, but Seth Rollins is a different personality altogether. With due respect to Priest, Rollins is on another level when it comes to resonating with the audience.Most fans believe that bigger things await Rollins, and that could all begin with the upcoming contest during the WWE Money in the Bank 2024. Priest will face The Visionary in what will be a fight for the World Heavyweight championship.However, there's more at stake, all thanks to the gentleman's agreement the two superstars have between them. If Rollins loses the fight, he won't even challenge for the Heavyweight Title as long as Priest has his hands on it. However, Priest will have to leave the Judgment Day if he loses the fight.There's a general feeling that Priest might have outgrown Judgment Day. WWE Money in the Bank 2024 is the perfect chance to ensure that Priest goes the separate way from his current crib, which means that Rollins will win the contest in the future (a speculation, of course). However, Rollins winning the match might not automatically mean that he would get back his cherished title belt.There's a high chance that Judgment Day might intervene during the match (something that has become a common occurrence in recent weeks). Of course, their supposed attempt to help Priest might become the biggest reason for the superstar's departure. This is, of course, if Priest sticks to his agreement with Rollins.This sets up for an exciting outcome - Rollins wins the match, so he gets to challenge Priest in the future (who keeps the title as the WWE Money in the Bank 2024 contest ends in DQ). But Priest will no longer have the backing of Judgment Day, and then enters the third party - Gunther.Gunther's character transformation has been amazing, to say the least - a rise, a fall, and then a rise again. The Ring General was quick to send out the reminder that maybe the better person between Rollins and Priest would win to face him at Summerslam .If the WWE Money in the Bank 2024 contest between Rollins and Priest goes as predicted here, this could set up an eye-grabbing title fight at Summerslam. Instead of Gunther fighting any one of Rollins and Priest, he gets to fight both. That way, the audience gets a triple threat fight for the World Heavyweight Championship, where all three wrestlers have some agendas to fill.Of course, only WWE knows what they want to do with the WWE Money in the Bank 2024 fight, and the outcomes mentioned here are predictions. But fans will hope that the upcoming contest will be spicy, which will be wholly justified given the wrestlers and the stakes involved.","WWE Money in the Bank 2024 could witness Seth Rollins' new rise at the cost of Damian Priest.

BRIDGETOWN ( Barbados ): Hardik Pandya has been to hell and back in the last few months. An injury cut short a promising ODI World Cup campaign and that eventually cost him his T20 captaincy as well. It was followed by a disastrous move to Mumbai Indians from Gujarat Titans in the IPL, replacing Rohit Sharma as the captain, which wasn’t too well received by fans.His form, too, took a nosedive and there was a clamour to drop him from the T20 World Cup squad.The BCCI and captain Rohit, however, felt Hardik had done enough to get a chance. He was included to add depth to a lineup both in batting and bowling. It was ironic that he was left to bowl the last over with 16 to play with in the final, but Hardik rose to the occasion and got the job done.He also got the wicket of the super-dangerous Heinrich Klaasen that actually started South Africa’s downfall.During a chat with the media after the game, Hardik talked about what he had endured, how he fought back and what was going through his mind when he was bowling the last over.Excerpts....It is obviously very special. From where I come from, this is something that is always a dream and it is a feeling that I can’t describe, more so when I knew that everything came down to me at the end. I am just very happy for the group.Yes, a lot of people said a lot of things without knowing who Hardik Pandya is. Everyone had an opinion and I don’t mind that, but I have always maintained that you never reply with words. You can only answer with your actions. Yes, there were difficulties but I knew that I won’t be down always. I believe it is important to be graceful in victory and in defeat, and I tried to maintain that. Only thing I want to tell the fans is that they, too, should learn to be graceful, at times they should also find better ways to express themselves. Anyway, I am sure they will also be happy today.2026 is far off. For now, I am very happy for Rohit and Virat, two giants of Indian cricket who deserve every bit of the success. We will obviously miss them in the format but at the same time, this is probably the best farewell that we could have given them. This victory is a tribute to the brotherhood that has been created in the team.I think I was enjoying it. Not too many people get such chances which can change their lives. Things might have gone the other way, but it didn’t bother me. I knew there was no point taking pressure, I just tried to bank on my skillset. I think it was written in the stars. I have always tried to keep smiling through the difficulties and I can assure you this is going to be a very long smile.Now that we have won, I feel that even if I hadn’t scored, it wouldn’t have mattered. Individual performances don’t matter when the team doesn’t win. But whenever I got the chance, I was happy that I could contribute something to the team’s cause. I have always played my cricket that way. If it is one over, I try to do it to the best of my ability","Hardik Pandya has been through a lot in the last few months.

While many have related Rohit Sharma 's unique walk up to the stage to receive the T20 World Cup trophy to the way Argentina legend Lionel Messi received the FIFA World Cup, a video has emerged on social media showing that it was actually spinner Kuldeep Yadav who planned it and then also demonstrated it to Rohit.India (176 for 7) defeated South Africa (169 for 8) by seven runs in a nerve-wracking final in Barbados on Saturday to end a 17-year wait for another T20 World Cup triumph.The trophy also ended a draught of 11 years for India without an ICC title, with the last one being the 2013 Champions Trophy.In terms of T20 World Cup, it was the last chance for Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli to win a world title in the shortest format as both predictably announced their retirement from T20Is after India's victory.Before Rohit went on the recieve the trophy, Kuldeep could be seen showing his skipper how he should approach the trophy when called upon. The video has gone viral on social media.India rode on Virat Kohli's best knock of the tournament, a 59-ball 76, and Axar Patel's 47 to put up a challenging total, before Hardik Pandya (3 for 20), Jasprit Bumrah (2 for 18) and Arshdeep Singh (2 for 20) derailed South Africa's run chase. The Proteas had at one stage moved into a winning position, requiring just a run a ball.The wicket of Heinrich Klaasen (52 of 27 balls) by Pandya and the stunning catch of Suryakumar Yadav to dismiss David Miller (21 off 17 balls) proved to be the turning points in the match.",Kuldeep Yadav shows Rohit Sharma how to receive T20 World Cup trophy.

The hurricane, which reached category 4, caused significant damage to coastal infrastructure. The Indian cricket team found themselves unable to leave after winning the title with a seven-run victory over South Africa on Saturday.PM Mia Mottley has been actively involved in overseeing relief operations. She expressed optimism about resuming normal airport operations shortly.""We hope, and we're working towards later today. I don't want to speak in advance of it, but I've literally been in touch with the airport personnel and they're doing their last checks now and we want to resume normal operations as a matter of urgency,"" Mottley told PTI.The disruption has affected many plans, with people intending to leave either late last night, today, or tomorrow morning.""There are a number of people who were due to leave late last night or today or tomorrow morning. And we want to make sure that we can facilitate those persons, so I would anticipate that within the next six to 12 hours that the airport will be open,"" she said.Prime Minister Mottley also hoped that the Indian team, who has remained at their hotel since winning the title, are in high spirits despite the circumstances surrounding their stay.""I'm sure that in spite of the passage of the hurricane, that they would have been in a very, very, very good mood and spirit and to win in the manner that they won on Saturday.

Fitness tests no more 'criterion' for Team India selection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/fitness-tests-no-more-criterion-for-team-india-selection/articleshow/111418375.cms,"Focus has shifted to injury preventive tests & performance tests for contracted players

Dravid

, Rohit devised 'rotation' blueprint in February 2022

NEW DELHI: The T20 World Cup winning campaign was a rare instance in the last five years when the Indian team had all its resources fit and available for selection. Plagued by recurring injuries to star players like Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya post the 2019 ODI World Cup, the Indian cricket board's ( BCCI ) medical team at the National Cricket Academy ( NCA ) changed its approach for contracted players from doing fitness tests to injury preventive tests and performance tests in the last two years.According to a NCA document, in possession of TOI, it is clearly mentioned that the standard fitness tests are not a 'selection criterion' for players. The Indian team management under the captaincy of Virat Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri had made fitness tests like the yo-yo test , which checks the endurance of athletes, a yardstick for players to get into the team.The NCA team, comprising physios and strength & conditioning coaches, has devised three proformas which are known as National Fitness Testing Criteria (NFTC), Performance Testing Battery and Prevention Testing Battery. The NFTC is supposed to be done every 12-16 weeks, performance testing every six weeks and prevention testing every two weeks.The NFTC consists of 10 metre sprint test, 20 metre sprint test, standing long jump, yo-yo tests and dexa scan (fat percentage). Interestingly, the document states that these numbers are derived from the average of athletes in an age group and are only group benchmarks. ""Please note these are only fitness measures and not a selection criterion,"" the document reads.Notably, the yo-yo and 20 metre sprint numbers are set higher for emerging players than centrally contracted players. The yo-yo mark for contracted players is 16.5 while emerging players are expected to score 16.7.What's more interesting is that these yo-yo tests have become a rarity for contracted players at NCA. ""The idea is that once a player is centrally contracted, he must have reached the desired level of fitness. With the amount of cricket and time they spend on the road, it is unreasonable for contracted players to undergo NFTC tests. So, the focus has shifted to injury prevention and performance tests. Team India strength and conditioning coach Soham Desai, along with physios Yogesh Parmar, Thulasi and Kamlesh Jain, has done a great job keeping the players in shape through the 2023 ODI World Cup and this T20 World Cup,"" a BCCI source told TOI.The prevention test has become the most important tool. There are tests like overhead squat, walking lunges, glute bridge hold and half kneeling medicine ball throw. These are short tests but it is observed if the player could hold his posture correctly through the tests. If the players struggle to do so, it's warning sign that the player could be risking an injury.The GPS vests and whoop bands provide information about running-bowling metrics and players taking responsibility of their off-field activities like sleep and recovery.According to sources, surgery is the last option. Like in the cases of Bumrah, Hardik, Ravindra Jadeja and Shreyas Iyer, the medical team tried to work around these battery tests in 2022-23, ""There are data and tests galore to ensure that the player is in prime shape when he takes the field. The performance testing battery and prevention testing battery played a big role in players going out on the field and performing without worrying about breaking down,"" the source said.Outgoing Team India head coach Rahul Dravid and captain Rohit Sharma had prepared a blueprint for the pool of players in Feb 2022. ""The captain and coach had sat down with the strength and conditioning coach and the physios in February. They had marked the India's schedule. Rohit and Dravid had given them a pool of players. The support staff was told to ensure those players are available and in the best shape for the T20 World Cup in 2022. The process continued for ODI World Cup in 2023 and now this T20 World Cup. Thus, each series was marked for the players to play in"" a source said.While all the attention was on India's probable top 15 players, the team management was actually working towards like-for-like options for every player. In effect, the team management had been looking at about 30 players.""It was decided that if the trainers and physios feel a player is about to hit his threshold, he would be rested straightaway. If any player reveals any discomfort, the team management is willing to rest him at that very point. It's better to err on the side of caution,"" the source added.Dravid and Rohit have been handicapped due to injuries to Bumrah and Jadeja in 2022 T20 World Cup before losing Rishabh Pant and Pandya in the ODI World Cup last year. But they stuck to their plans of protecting and preparing players for India to finally lift an ICC trophy in Barbados last Saturday.",Focus has shifted to injury preventive tests & performance tests for contracted players at the National Cricket Academy.

The ninth edition of ICC Men's T20 World Cup saw new marks being set in terms of various records in tournament's history, as India lifted their second trophy to once again become the T20 world champions after beating South Africa in a pulsating final.Here's a look at the firsts and some old marks breached to create history:India and South Africa reached the summit clash unbeaten and ended the tournament with 8 wins each.India could have made it nine but missed out because of the washout in the group-stage match against Canada.India's 176 for 7 in the title clash broke Australia's record of 173 for 2, which they set in the final of the 2021 edition against New ZealandRohit Sharma 's age of 37 years and 60 days on the day of the final (June 29) made him the oldest captain to win a T20 World Cup. Rohit and Virat Kohli announced their retirement from T20Is after India's victory.Pacers Arshdeep Singh from India and Fazalhaq Farooqi from Afghanistan took 17 wickets each to jointly top the tally. It is also a new record for most wickets in a single edition of the T20 World Cup, going past Sri Lanka spinner Wanindu Hasaranga's mark of 16 wickets.The 'Player of the Tournament' and India's bowling spearhead Jasprit Bumrah registered a bowling average of 8.3, which is the best so far across T20 World Cups. His economy rate was a miserly 4.17.The white-ball specialist from England, pacer Chris Jordan broke Jacques Kallis's record for the best bowling strike-rate in a T20 World Cup.

Fighters, heroes, champions, Rohit Sharma and his team gave India one of its most joyous cricketing moments on Saturday night.The T20 World Cup triumph was a team effort but overall, seven men stood taller than the rest.He was in woeful batting form in IPL & stripped of MI captaincy. But cometh the hour, cometh the man! As in ODI World Cup, Rohit again put the team before himself.He played with abandon and flow; his strike rate was a staggering 157 and he scored 257 runs, highest in the squad. More importantly, as commentators said, he exudedcraft and calm in captaincy executing dressing room plans to perfection. His ebullience at the top will be as missed as his captaincyHis 24 fours and 15 sixes were the highest in the team.In 1999, South Africa had dropped the World Cup. Thanks to Yadav, India didn’t. His once-in-a-generation catch in the deep was as memorable as Kapil Dev’s backward sprint and grab of Vivian Richards’. ‘SKY’ had the pressure of living up to his rank as world’s no. 1 T20 batter. His knocks against USA and England were vital to the team’s cause. And his destructive intervention served India well against Australia (31 off 16) and Afghanistan (53 off 28)He scored 60% of his runs in fours and sixes.He rewrote his life story at the World Cup. A foot injury had forced Pandya to quit 2023 ODI WC midway. His MI transfer and captaincy became a huge controversy; his IPL form the subject of cruel digs. But the 30-year-old all-rounder underlined why he is irreplaceable. He scored runs at an electrifying pace (strike rate: 151)this WC and mixed his pace to claim 11 wickets while breaking partnerships and providing vital breakthroughsHis 3/20 included the game changing wickets of Klaasen and Miller in the finalHis aggressive batting and sharp left-arm spin provided India’s most serendipitous moments in the championship. He knifed through England’s top and middle order (3/23), helped India regain momentum with the bat (47 off 31, 4 sixes) in the final and against Pakistan. He arrived as a utility player, left as a premium all-rounderHis breathtaking catch of Oz captain Mitchell Marsh swung the game India’s wayThe thrashing in the final aside, the joyful ‘chinaman’ with curly hair delighted India cricket lovers with his subtle guile and craft from Super 8 onwards. Was at his best breaking England’s back in the semisThe delivery that bowled England’s Harry Brook around the legs can be watched on a loopHe played eight games and was unplayable in each of them. Every batter handled him like expensive glass, with utmost care, and yet all were bamboozled by his video game-like craft. Bumrah is the world’s best paceman, and by a mile. Nobody has his deception, movement, variation, a lethal cocktail that earned him 15 wickets at 8.2 runs apiece for an astonishing economy rate of 4.2. He was The Man of this WC. His ER is the best ever in a T20 WC by a bowler to deliver at least 20 oversToo many. But most notably the wickets of Mohammad Rizwan (Pakistan), Phil Salt (England), Reeza Hendricks and Marco Jansen (SA). All bowled.The 25-year-old Chandigarh-born claimed the second pacer’s spot exploiting the sharp movement and bounce of USA’s uneven pitches and proved to be an admirable foil to Bumrah. His 17 wickets, which made him the tournament’s joint-highest wicket-taker with Afghanistan’s Fazalhaq Farooqi, is also the joint-highest of any T20 WC.Dismissals of the dangerous Tim David and Mathew Wade (Australia) in one over.Wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja and Shivam Dube also had their moments. Pant’s 42 off 31 against Pakistan on a treacherous pitch was invaluable.Squad members Sanju Samson, Yuzvendra Chahal and Yashasvi Jaiswal didn’t get a game.got the best out of his wards, finishing his tenure on a high note.Before the final, his scores were: 1, 4, 0, 24, 37, 0, 9. Balance and focus are his forte. But Kohli, who scored runs by the bagful at IPL 2024, seemed to lose both at the WC. It turned out he had reserved his best for the final. His 76 off 59 balls against SA was more than his total in 7 earlier innings: 75. India will miss his class and reassuring presence in the game’s shortest versionKohli has 16 MoMs in T20I, a world record. Eight of them at WC, again highest for anyone.","The T20 World Cup triumph was a team effort but overall, seven men stood taller than the rest.

Axar Patel's valuable contribution of 47 runs off 31 balls also played a crucial role in India's total.In response, South Africa suffered two early setbacks but managed to stage an impressive comeback through the efforts of Heinrich Klaasen (52 off 27 balls) and Quinton de Kock (39 off 31 balls). Their partnership brought the required run rate down to just one run per ball.However, Hardik Pandya's timely intervention, dismissing the dangerous Klaasen, helped India regain control of the match. 'Player of the Tournament' Jasprit Bumrah's exceptional 18th over, in which he conceded only two runs and picked up a wicket, further tilted the balance in India's favour.Arshdeep then bowled the penultimate over and kept the pressure on the Proteas by giving away just four runs.The defining moment of the match came at the start of the 20th over when Suryakumar Yadav took a spectacular catch at the boundary off Pandya's bowling. Pandya's impressive figures of 3 for 20 were the best on the bowling chart as South Africa's chase fell short, finishing at 169 for 8, securing a thrilling victory for India.",Arshdeep Singh is one of the most underplayed stories of India's T20 World Cup triumph.

He connected with a wide full toss from Hardik Pandya , but Suryakumar Yadav managed to steady himself just on the ropes, caught the ball, released it as he went over the boundary, and then re-entered the field to complete an astonishing catch.For many longtime fans, Surya's catch evoked memories of Kapil Dev's legendary catch in the 1983 World Cup final against the formidable West Indies. Kapil had sprinted from mid-on to dismiss Viv Richards with a spectacular catch off Madan Lal's bowling, showcasing exceptional judgment and athleticism.Surya, at 33 years old, ensured his name would be fondly remembered in Indian cricket lore every time fans recall the dramatic finale in Bridgetown.Earlier in the match, South Africa had required 30 runs from 30 balls but faltered in familiar fashion, with Hardik Pandya triggering a collapse by dismissing Heinrich Klaasen, who was well-set on 52.

The result helped Brazil bounce back strongly from a disappointing opening performance.Vinicius, who had a subdued outing in the previous game, was a constant menace down the left flank throughout the match.His movement and trickery caused significant problems for the Paraguayan defence.His first goal, arriving in the 35th minute, exemplified Brazil's fluid attacking play. A well-worked team move culminated in Lucas Paqueta delivering a precise first-time pass to Vinicius, who calmly slotted the ball home.Brazil doubled their lead shortly after through Girona winger Savio, who reacted quickest to a rebound inside the penalty area. Vinicius then added his second and Brazil's third just before half-time, capitalizing on a defensive error by Omar Alderete .The Paraguayan defender's attempted clearance struck Vinicius's outstretched leg and deflected into the net.Paraguay showed resilience early in the second half, pulling a goal back through a spectacular long-range strike from Alderete. However, any hopes of an unlikely comeback were dashed when Lucas Paqueta atoned for an earlier penalty miss by converting a spot-kick in the 68th minute.This victory leads Brazil to second place in Group D with four points from two matches. Colombia currently lead the group with a perfect record of two wins from two, securing their place in the quarter-finals. Costa Rica, on the other hand, occupy the third spot with one point, while Paraguay sit at the bottom of the table with two losses.","Brazil beat Paraguay 4-1 in their second Group D match of the Copa America.

On the other hand, Gareca was late in bringing on a player at halftime during Chile's match against Argentina on Tuesday.CONMEBOL cited articles 104 and 145 of the tournament's regulations, which stipulate that teams must take the field on time for the scheduled start or restart of play. Failure to do so has resulted in the one-match suspension for both Scaloni and Gareca, preventing them from being present on the substitutes' bench during their respective teams' final group stage matches on Saturday.In addition to the suspensions, the Argentine and Chilean football federations have each been fined $15,000 as a consequence of their teams' tardiness.As things stand, Argentina currently top Group A with six points and have already secured their place in the quarter-finals. They will face Peru on Saturday without the presence of Scaloni on the sidelines.Meanwhile, Chile, with only one point, will take on group runners-up Canada in their final group match, also without the guidance of Gareca from the bench.While the suspensions and fines may seem harsh, they serve as a reminder to teams and coaching staff of the need to respect the established rules and schedules, ensuring the smooth and timely progression of the competition.","The South American football governing body, CONMEBOL, has taken disciplinary action against the coaches of Argentina and Chile, Lionel Scaloni and Ricardo Gareca.

The goals from Luis Diaz , Davinson Sanchez , and Jhon Cordoba ensured that Colombia finished in the top two positions in Group D.With this win, Colombia extended their unbeaten streak to 25 games, a remarkable achievement that dates back to February 2022 when they suffered a defeat against Argentina.Nestor Lorenzo's well-drilled side displayed a composed and organized performance, never allowing Costa Rica to threaten their unbeaten record.The opening goal came in the 31st minute when Liverpool's Luis Diaz converted a penalty kick with authority after Costa Rican goalkeeper Patrick Sequeira committed a reckless challenge on Jhon Cordoba near the edge of the penalty area. Diaz's powerful strike found the top corner, giving Colombia the lead.Colombia came close to doubling their advantage in the 37th minute when veteran midfielder James Rodriguez picked out Diaz at the back post with a precise cross. However, Diaz's attempted cutback across the face of the goal narrowly evaded the outstretched Davinson Sanchez.Sanchez made amends for the missed opportunity in the 59th minute, glancing in Jhon Arias's left-wing cross to extend Colombia's lead to 2-0. Three minutes later, Cordoba scored the third goal with a clinical finish, latching onto Rodriguez's incisive through ball and firing a low shot across the goalkeeper and into the far corner.With this comprehensive victory, Colombia will qualify for the quarter-finals as group winners if they can secure at least a point against Brazil in their final group game on Tuesday.
