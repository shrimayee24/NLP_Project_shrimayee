I'll just see who is winning it at the end and I'll be happy. When I will play the World Cup, I will think about top four and all of that,"" Parag said in a chat with The Bharat Army.Recently Parag also claimed that he will go on to play for India one day, no matter what.""At some point, you'll have to take me, right? So that is my belief, I'm going to play for India. I don't really care when,"" Parag told PTI in an interview.The 22-year-old from Assam enjoyed a breakout IPL season this year with 573 runs at a strike-rate close to 150, coming in at No.4 for the Rajasthan Royals Playing for Royals since his debut season in 2018, Parag's totals in five previous seasons made for a sorry reading -- 160, 86, 93, 183, 78.But after pulling off a remarkable IPL season with the bat this year, there is a strong possibility that Parag along with Abhishek Sharma and Harshit Rana will be picked for the tour of Zimbabwe post T20 World Cup.","Parag said he will think about top four teams when he himself plays the World Cup.

As the IPL season 17 commenced, the narrative was dominated by Rishabh Pant ’s remarkable resilience, bouncing back from a harrowing accident to grace the cricket field again. The most uplifting aspect of Pant’s return was his visibly improved fitness and agility, particularly his wicketkeeping skills. What also dominated headlines in the IPL was Sanju Samson ’s newfound consistency that India’s 'keeping stocks were boosted for the T20 World Cup in the USA and West Indies.In most IPLs, Samson starts off with a bang, smashing a couple of match-winning knocks before tapering off. This time, though, Samson was a different man, leading the Rajasthan Royals.Starting with a match-winning 52-ball 82 not out against Lucknow Super Giants, the Kerala ’keeper-batsman, in a refreshing change, didn’t let the momentum drop, finishing with 531 runs in 16 matches at an average of 48.27, with five fifties and a strike rate of 153.46, most of them batting at No.3.“Sanju has always been a good player of spin and pace and a good wicketkeeper . However, what impressed the selectors this time was that he looked fitter. If he had shown this attitude to the game before, he could’ve played far more for India,” a source involved in the current decision-making process in Indian cricket told TOI.Praising Samson’s consistency in IPL 2024, former India wicketkeeper and ex-selector Saba Karim told TOI, “It was so refreshing to see Sanju bat like this. Everybody is talking about his consistency, but for me, more than that, it was the game awareness that he showed, as a captain and batter. His increased game awareness improved his consistency.”Displaying stellar leadership skills, fine form with the bat and a calm demeanour under pressure, the 29-year-old steered the Royals into the playoffs, compelling the national selectors and the team management in captain Rohit Sharma and head coach Rahul Dravid to consider him as a viable option for the wicketkeeper-batsman’s slot for the T20 World Cup.In the process, he pipped the experienced KL Rahul, who has scored 2265 runs in 72 matches for India and was a part of India’s last two T20 World Cup campaigns in UAE and Australia. Jitesh Sharma and Ishan Kishan were of course, left far behind by Samson.Who will India pick though between Pant and Samson in the playing XI?“They (Samson and Pant) play a different role altogether, so I don’t think there’s any competition between the two of them. Samson will get into the XI if the Indian team feels that it needs a batter at No 3, which means that Virat Kohli will open the innings. I don’t think Samson has been included in the team as a first or second wicketkeeper. He’s been included in the side as a batter. So, if the team management wants to play an additional top-order batter, then Samson will get in. Rishabh comes in lower down the order, at No 4 or No 5. It all depends on the needs of the team,” Karim felt.Going by sources too, Pant is ahead in the race because he’s a left-hander. Pant’s T20 record, though, is hardly inspiring. In the 66 matches he’s played for India, the 26-year-old scored 987 runs at an average of 22.43 and with a strike rate of 126.37, with just three fifties.“I feel both Rishabh and Sanju can play in the XI, because Rishabh is a left-hander. He’s adept at scoring at a high strike rate and is handy lower down, while Sanju can bat in the top-order, at NO. 3, if Virat opens,” Karim said.For someone who has hardly done justice to his immense talent at the international stage, it isn’t surprising that Samson’s record in T20Is is modest -- 374 runs in 25 matches at an average of 133.09, with just one fifty.Since the 2022 T20 World Cup, Samson has played six T20 Internationals for India, in which he has scored just 54 runs. He also didn’t do much of note while playing for Kerala in domestic cricket which does not help.But Samson is the man in form and his inclusion could be a game-changer for India. Should he play as the first-choice 'keeper-batsman ahead of Pant?“Not at all. If you noticed, Samson’s performance dropped off in the last five-six matches of this IPL too. He has been picked only because KL Rahul didn’t have a good IPL. Plus, you need a left-hander in the middle-order. Rishabh has made an impressive comeback, and could be our next captain,” former India off-spinner and selector Sarandeep Singh told TOI.For now, Samson must consider himself lucky that he’s finally getting to play a World Cup for India. Will this T20 World Cup be a turning point in this talented cricketer’s career?","Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson are in contention to be India's first-choice wicketkeeper-batsman for the 2022 T20 World Cup in USA and West Indies.

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic surpassed tennis legend Roger Federer after a five-set thriller against Francisco Cerundolo at the French Open on Monday.This victory marked Djokovic's 370th Grand Slam match win, surpassing Roger Federer for the most in men's singles history. It also secured his 59th Grand Slam quarterfinal appearance, another record .Djokovic's quest for a record-breaking 24th Grand Slam title was thrown into uncertainty due to a right knee injury. Despite the injury, which he aggravated during the match, Djokovic persevered to defeat Cerundolo in a gruelling encounter.The match, lasting over four hours, saw Djokovic struggle with his movement and receive a medical timeout for treatment. He considered retirement due to the pain but ultimately continued after receiving the maximum allowed dosage of pain medication.However, the arduous victory cast doubt on Djokovic's chances of progressing further in the tournament. He expressed significant concern about his fitness for his upcoming quarterfinal match against Casper Ruud , noting the medication's short-term effectiveness and the need for further evaluation.Djokovic also criticized the court conditions, attributing his injury partly to the slippery clay surface. He suggested that more frequent sweeping could have prevented his injury.“I mean, today I injured myself. Yes, I survived. I won the match. Great. But will I be able to play next one? I don’t know. I don’t know the severity of the injury. But could have this injury be prevented? Possibly, if there was just a little bit more of a frequent care of the court during the set,” said Djokovic, casting doubts over his fitness ahead of the quarterfinal match against Ruud.","Novak Djokovic defeated Francisco Cerundolo in a five-set thriller at the French Open.

NEW DELHI: Anrich Nortje dismantled Sri Lanka with career-best figures of 4/7 as South Africa leveraged the available bounce to secure a six-wicket victory in their T20 World Cup opener on Monday.At a venue where India is set to play three of their four Group A league matches, Sri Lanka's decision to bat first backfired spectacularly.Nortje, along with Kagiso Rabada (2/21) and Keshav Maharaj (2/22), led a dominant bowling performance that saw Sri Lanka collapse for 77 in 19.1 overs, marking their lowest T20 total.However, it wasn't an easy chase for South Africa in the tricky conditions at Nassau Stadium. The Proteas faced a challenging start as Sri Lanka reduced them to 27/2 inside the powerplay.Sri Lankan wrist spinner Wanindu Hasaranga spearheaded their bowling effort with figures of 2/17 from three overs, claiming the wickets of Quinton de Kock (20) and Tristan Stubbs (13) in consecutive overs.Despite this, the lack of scoreboard pressure allowed South Africa to reach the target in 16.2 overs, significantly boosting their net run rate.South Africa now leads the Group D standings with two points and a net run rate of 1.048. The group also includes Bangladesh, Nepal, and the Netherlands.The in-form Heinrich Klaasen effectively ended the contest in the 15th over by smashing Hasaranga for a massive six over long-on, followed by a straight boundary for a total of 11 runs.Nuwan Thushara struck first for Sri Lanka in the second over, drawing an outside edge from Reeza Hendricks with an outswinger.Angelo Mathews gave Aiden Markram a tough time, even hitting the South African skipper awkwardly in the abdomen, requiring medical attention. Markram broke the tension with a spectacular six through covers but was dismissed in the next over by Dasun Shanaka, with Kamindu Mendis pulling off a stunning catch at slip.Nortje bowled with pace and precision, surpassing his previous best T20 figures of 4/10.Kagiso Rabada returned with 2/21, while wily left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj thrived in the conditions, finishing with 2/22.The drop-in pitch at Nassau County International Cricket Stadium proved to be a nightmare for the Sri Lankan batters, who struggled to time the ball, further hindered by a slow outfield.The Proteas' attack, however, thrived in the friendly conditions, starting with a first-ball wicket for Ottneil Baartman, who returned impressive figures of 1/9 on his World Cup debut. The rookie pacer hit the deck hard, inducing an edge off Pathum Nissanka (3) from a full delivery that swung away and had some bounce.Nortje was fast and furious, claiming a wicket in his first over when Kamindu Mendis mistimed a pull, leaving Sri Lanka at 31/2 inside eight overs.There was also support for spinners, with Maharaj striking twice in successive deliveries to dismiss skipper Wanindu Hasaranga and Sadeera Samarawickrama.Half of the Sri Lankan side was back in the pavilion at the midway mark, with Nortje taking his second wicket as Kusal Mendis mistimed a pull.Veteran Angelo Mathews, the most comfortable Sri Lankan batter, managed 16 runs from 16 balls before Nortje dismissed him for his fourth wicket.A run-out of Nuwan Thushara concluded Sri Lanka's innings in 19.1 overs.",South Africa beat Sri Lanka by six wickets in their T20 World Cup opener. Anrich Nortje took career-best figures of 4/7 as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 77. Kagiso Rabada took 2/21 and Keshav Maharaj 2/22 as South Africa reached target in 16.2 overs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110675602,imgsize-63868,width-400,resizemode-4/110675602.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Head coach Rahul Dravid remained tight-lipped when questioned about India's opening combination for their T20 World Cup opener against Ireland on June 5. While Rohit Sharma is anticipated to partner with Virat Kohli at the top of the order, there is also speculation regarding Yashasvi Jaiswal as a potential option.""We've got options, so we are obviously not going to reveal our cards just yet, but certainly we've got options. We have Rohit and Jaiswal and Virat opened in the IPL as well.""We picked the team keeping in mind that we have three options and we could pick and choose what we wanted depending on the conditions and kind of combination we go into these games with,"" said Dravid while talking to reporters in New York.The playing surface at the Nassau County ground has drawn attention due to its inconsistent bounce and sluggish outfield. However, Dravid chose not to voice any grievances regarding the pitch conditions. Dravid emphasized that his squad will focus on adjusting their game to suit the current state of the ground.""We had three practice sessions here. From the third session onwards, the wicket became better. But a wicket is a wicket. We don't want to label it as bad or good. It is a wicket and you have to manage and you have to adjust to it. So we will not complain about the wicket.""A score of 200 was considered a par in the recently concluded IPL, but here at this venue, it appears to be more than just a par score; it seems like a winning score.""As we talk about T20 cricket, maybe we won't be able to play like that in this tournament. Maybe in this venue. We will hopefully play in many venues. So, it will be different there. So, it will be important to adapt.""South Africa captain Aiden Markram echoed sentiments about the challenging batting conditions after the low-scoring game against Sri Lanka on Monday, emphasizing the tough surface to bat on.Dravid emphasized once again that his players will need to adapt to the varied conditions, echoing the sentiment of resilience and flexibility in approaching the game.""I didn't watch the match today. We will see the recording. But the score was a little low (Sri Lanka were shot out for 77). I have no idea what exactly happened. But if it is like that, then you will have to fight and make 140.""Maybe that will be the winning score. In some matches, there will be a winning score of 200. So whatever the score is, you will have to react and adapt.""Dravid defended the performance of the players in the recent ICC events, acknowledging the team's efforts despite falling short at crucial moments. India lost the WTC final and ODI World Cup final to Australia last year, extending their title drought on the global stage.The team's last ICC title came in 2013. While the outcomes may have been disappointing, Dravid likely emphasized the need to learn from these experiences and strive for improvement in future tournaments.""To be very honest with you, I think we've actually played really well in these World Cup tournaments. In terms of our consistency, we've been very consistent,"" said Dravid when asked if the past defeats have made the players better prepared for this event.""Obviously making the semi-final in Australia (2022). The World Test Championship is slightly different, it's not one tournament, but it's a whole cycle but playing extremely well in that cycle to get to the final there again.""And then we know the 50-over World Cup where we had a great run and went into the final. So, in terms of our consistency and quality of cricket that we have played in these big tournaments, we've been right up there with some of the best teams.""The coach expressed the team's determination to maintain their high standards and aim for ultimate success.""Yes, we probably haven't been able to get across the line in the knockout game.

So, hopefully we play good cricket to get ourselves into those positions again and then maybe play good cricket on the day to cross the line.""The important thing when you start these tournaments is not to think about that, is to actually think about getting into those positions. You have to find yourselves in those positions where you are pushing for glory and that's all you can do as a group and as a team,"" said Dravid.He also expressed missing the buzz that is typically associated with a world event but remained hopeful that it would change when Team India plays their games.""The buzz that you have around these events, obviously with cricket not being, say, one of the major sports in this country.

NEW DELHI: The T20 World Cup 's opening match between South Africa and Sri Lanka took place at the Nassau Stadium in New York, where the pitch conditions were far from ideal. Both team captains expressed their dissatisfaction with the surface.Sri Lanka's batting performance was abysmal, as they were bowled out for a meager 77 runs, their lowest total in T20 cricket history. South Africa, despite the low target, had to work hard for their victory, eventually reaching the target with six wickets in hand and 3.4 overs to spare.The criticism from the captains highlighted the importance of providing suitable playing conditions for such a high-profile tournament. The drop-in pitch at the Nassau Stadium clearly failed to meet the expectations of the players and the cricketing community.""The batting was a little up and down... quite a tough wicket but we found some way to score runs. It's a tough one from a batting perspective,"" said SA skipper Aiden Markram at the post-match presentation.""You try to take the pitch out of it, but if the ball misbehaves or there's low bounce, it's just one of those things and hopefully we can take some learnings out of it,"" added the skipper, who scored 12 runs.The South African captain mentioned that playing on the pitch would provide his side with some advantage ahead of their upcoming games.""Obviously fortunate that we have our next two games here, so we know what to expect. But important to assess as you move around.""Sri Lankan skipper Wanindu Hasaranga remarked that the pitch was not conducive to high-scoring matches.""Our batters were looking at 160-170. To be honest this a 120 wicket, especially with our bowlers.""We went with our bowling strength, that's why we batted first. We wanted to put up a good score and defend it. This is early in the tournament, as a team we wanted to do much better especially in the batting. We know we have bowling strength, so if our batters do well we can go further,"" he added.","Sri Lanka bowled out for 77, their lowest total in T20 cricket history.

NEW DELHI: South African pacer Anrich Nortje rediscovered his rhythm and claimed a career-best 4/7 as the Proteas capitalised on the bouncy conditions to skittle out Sri Lanka for a paltry 77 in their T20 World Cup encounter in New York on Sunday.The venue, which will host three of India's four Group A league matches, witnessed Sri Lanka's decision to bat first backfire spectacularly as they recorded their lowest total in T20 cricket. Nuwan Thushara 's run-out brought their innings to a close in 19.1 overs.Nortje spearheaded the four-man pace attack, surpassing his previous best T20 figures of 4/10. Kagiso Rabada chipped in with 2/21, while the crafty left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj also thrived in the conditions, finishing with 2/22.The drop-in pitch at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium turned out to be a nightmare for the Lankan batsmen, who found it difficult to time the ball, and the slow outfield only compounded their woes.The Proteas attack, on the other hand, relished the favorable conditions. Ottneil Baartman, making his World Cup debut, struck with his very first delivery, extracting an edge from Pathum Nissanka (3) with a full-length delivery that swung away and had some extra bounce. Baartman ended with impressive figures of 1/9.Nortje was fast and furious, claiming a wicket in his first over when Kusal Mendis mistimed a pull shot, leaving the score at 31/2 inside eight overs.Spin also played a role, with Maharaj striking twice in consecutive deliveries to remove skipper Wanindu Hasaranga and Sadeera Samarawickrama .By the halfway mark, half of the Sri Lankan side was back in the pavilion, with Nortje taking his second wicket after Kusal Mendis mistimed another pull. The experienced Angelo Mathews looked the most comfortable, scoring 16 off 16 balls before falling to Nortje.","Sri Lanka bowled out for 77 in their T20 World Cup encounter in New York.

Sidhu's Playing XI:

India's only practice match against Bangladesh ahead of their T20 World Cup opener versus Ireland gave some indications about the make-up of India's likely playing eleven in their first match of Group A.India mauled Bangladesh by 60 runs in New York on Saturday to win the warm-up match in which they utilized services of 12 players from the 15-member squad.Virat Kohli did not play the warm-up game, neither did Yashasvi Jaiswal, which are the two names among whom India will decide who partners skipper Rohit Sharma to open batting. However, former India batsman and Star Sports commentator Navjot Singh Sidhu was clear about the pair that will open India's batting against Ireland on June 5.""The practice game has made it clear that Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli will open,"" said Sidhu on Star Sports, despite Kohli and Jaiswal both not featuring in the warm-up match where India scored 182 for 5 batting first.Rohit scored 23 off 19 balls, but the Indian showstopper in batting was Rishabh Pant who hit 53 off 32. Other notable contributors were Hardik Pandya (40 not out off 23) and Suryakumar Yadav (31 off 18).""There are more chances of Shivam Dube playing because he featured (in the warm-up game),"" said Sidhu, who possibly reasoned it on the basis that allrounder Dube was utilized both as a batsman and bowler ahead of Axar Patel, who only bowled in the warm-up game.Dube scored 14 off 16 balls and bowled an impressive three-over spell of 2 for 13. Axar delivered two overs and took 1 for 10. Left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh registered the best figures among Indian bowlers with 2 for 12 in three overs.""One thing is sure: five (specialist) bowlers will play,"" Sidhu reckoned.""If you want to play an extra spinner against Ireland, which should be the case, then it's very clear that in place of Mohammed Siraj, you will play Yuzvendra Chahal,"" Sidhu said, favouring the leg-spinner.""If Kuldeep and Yuzi Chahal bowl in tandem against Ireland, the weakness of the opposition makes your strength,"" he concluded.Besides India and Ireland, Group A consists of Pakistan, co-hosts USA and Canada.After opening their campaign against Ireland, India will take on Pakistan in tournament's big game on June 9 in New York.Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant (wk), Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Jasprit Bumrah, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh, Mohammed Siraj/Yuzvendra Chahal",India mauled Bangladesh by 60 runs in New York on Saturday to win the warm-up match.

Being the captain of the side, my mind was always occupied. But somewhere in the back of my mind it was there because World Cup selections were also around, it was a huge thing.”Reflecting on his recent batting performances, Samson acknowledged that his aggressive intent to make every ball count may have played a role in earning him a spot in the World Cup squad. However, he remained cautious and mindful of potential selection issues as well.“One of the best things that could happen to my career was those shots we keep on playing, and I knew that I had a reasonably good season in the IPL where I do have my chances to get in. But at the same time, I know how tough it is. It depends on what the team wants, and the combination the team and selectors and management are looking for,” he added.“But the moment I got convinced that Sanju you are ready, life and cricket gave back to me.

NEW DELHI: Real Madrid secured a record-extending 15th Champions League title with a 2-0 victory over Borussia Dortmund at Wembley Stadium .The Spanish side, known for their resilience and experience in high-stakes matches, weathered a dominant first-half performance from Dortmund before capitalizing on their opportunities in the second half.Dortmund, appearing in their first Champions League final since 2013, started brightly and created numerous scoring chances. Karim Adeyemi, Niclas Füllkrug, Julian Brandt, and Marcel Sabitzer all came close to breaking the deadlock, but Thibaut Courtois, in his fifth appearance of an injury-interrupted season, produced several crucial saves to keep Real Madrid level.Despite Dortmund's early pressure, Real Madrid remained composed and gradually grew into the game in the second half. Toni Kroos tested Gregor Kobel with a free-kick before Dani Carvajal broke the deadlock in the 74th minute, heading in a Kroos corner.The goal shifted the momentum decisively in Real Madrid's favour. Vinicius Jr. doubled their lead in the 83rd minute, finishing clinically after being released by Jude Bellingham's misplaced pass.

Dortmund coach Edin Terzic optimistic ahead of Champions League final against Real Madrid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/dortmund-coach-edin-terzic-optimistic-ahead-of-champions-league-final-against-real-madrid/articleshow/110620925.cms,"(Inputs from AFP)

NEW DELHI: Borussia Dortmund coach Edin Terzic believes ""anything is possible"" as his team prepares to face the formidable Real Madrid in the Champions League final at London's Wembley Stadium on Saturday.Real Madrid enters the final as heavy favorites, aiming to secure their 15th European title and sixth in the last 11 seasons. They face a Dortmund side that has already defied expectations by reaching the final.Despite Real Madrid's dominance this season, having lost just twice in 54 games and clinched the La Liga title with a 10-point lead, they had to overcome significant challenges to reach the Champions League final, as described by coach Carlo Ancelotti .""We have to enjoy being here,"" said Ancelotti at his pre-match press conference. ""But knowing it can go wrong because we are close to the most important thing in football – winning a Champions League – but having the fear this can escape us.""Ancelotti's squad showcased resilience by overcoming defending champions Manchester City on penalties in the quarter-finals and staging a legendary late comeback against Bayern Munich in the semi-finals at the Santiago Bernabeu.""We never stop believing, no matter how the circumstances are,"" said Luka Modric . Along with Nacho, Dani Carvajal, and Toni Kroos—playing his final match for the club—Modric could win the European Cup for a record-equalling sixth time. ""We always believe, keep believing, keep pushing, fighting until the end. In the end, we manage to find a way to beat opponents. Many people say there is luck, but when it happens so many times, I think it's not just luck.""Borussia Dortmund faces the challenge of overcoming a significant financial gap with Real Madrid as they aim to secure their second Champions League title. Last season, Madrid boasted record revenues of 831 million euros ($901 million), while Dortmund's stood at 420 million euros, according to Deloitte.The trajectory of Jude Bellingham 's career underscores Dortmund's challenge. Initially signed from English Championship side Birmingham as a teenager, Bellingham was developed by Dortmund before being transferred to Madrid for over 100 million euros a year ago. Dortmund struggled in the Bundesliga this season, finishing fifth and trailing Bayer Leverkusen by 27 points.Despite these challenges, Terzic's team has excelled in the Champions League, reaching the final for the third time and the first since their defeat to Bayern Munich at Wembley 11 years ago. Dortmund emerged as the victors of a challenging group that included Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan, and Newcastle. They then defeated PSV Eindhoven and Atletico Madrid before a remarkable defensive effort secured a victory over PSG in the semi-finals.""They are the favourites but we don’t care,"" said Terzic. ""We haven’t been the favourites against Atletico or against PSG. But if we are brave and not here to watch Real Madrid lift the trophy, if we are here to give them a game, then we have a chance.""Despite Dortmund being allocated only 30,000 tickets for the 90,000-capacity stadium, over 100,000 fans are estimated to have traveled to London. UEFA will aim to keep the focus on the on-field action, hoping their choice of Wembley for the final won't be scrutinized. The Euro 2020 final saw violence as ticketless fans breached the stadium, prompting the English Football Association to invest £5 million ($6 million) in enhancing safety and infrastructure at Wembley. Wembley is also scheduled to host the Euro 2028 final.","Borussia Dortmund coach Edin Terzic believes ""anything is possible"" as his team prepares to face the formidable Real Madrid in the Champions League final at London's Wembley Stadium.
