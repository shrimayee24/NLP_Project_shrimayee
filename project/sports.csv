India Vs Australia: Historic! Jasprit Bumrah equals legendary Kapil Dev's record with fifer in Australia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/historic-jasprit-bumrah-equals-legendary-kapil-devs-record-with-fifer-in-australia/articleshow/115586181.cms,"Jasprit Bumrah and Kapil Dev (Photo Credits: Getty Images)

Don't look at captaincy as a post but responsibility: Jasprit Bumrah

NEW DELHI: Team India pacer and stand-in skipper Jasprit Bumrah has once again etched his name in the history books, achieving his 11th five-wicket haul in Test cricket on Saturday during the first Test of the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy .With this, Bumrah has become the joint-highest Indian bowler with the most five-wicket hauls in SENA (South Africa, England, New Zealand, Australia) nations.His seven five-wicket haul has placed him right at the top of the table alongside legendary Kapil Dev , who also amassed the same number of fifers in 62 innings, 11 fewer than that of Bumrah.His remarkable performance also sees him enter the top-10 list for the most fifers by an Indian bowler, further cementing his status as one of the finest pacers in cricket history.What sets Bumrah apart is his extraordinary average of around 22 against SENA opponents in Asia—surpassing legends like Wasim Akram , Imran Khan, and Waqar Younis.On Day 2 of the Test, Bumrah struck on the first ball of his spell, removing Alex Carey with a brilliant short-of-length delivery that bounced and seamed away, forcing a loose shot.The edge was safely taken by Rishabh Pant, handing Bumrah his fifth scalp of the innings and a reason to celebrate with arms aloft and a beaming smile.Day 1 had already shown glimpses of Bumrah's brilliance. After India's disappointing collapse for 150 runs, the skipper stepped up to lead the fightback.His first breakthrough came in the third over, trapping debutant Nathan McSweeney lbw after a successful DRS review.Despite a dropped catch by Virat Kohli off Marnus Labuschagne, Bumrah remained relentless.In the seventh over, he struck twice in two balls—first dismissing Usman Khawaja with an edge safely caught by Kohli, and then bowling a full in-swinger to send Steve Smith back for a golden duck.","Jasprit Bumrah becomes joint-highest Indian bowler with the most five-wicket hauls in SENA (South Africa, England, New Zealand, Australia) nations.

Stand-in captain Jasprit Bumrah produced a scintillating spell of fast bowling to drag India back into the contest after a disastrous batting display on the opening day of the first Test against Australia in Brisbane. The day saw 17 wickets tumble on a green-top pitch, the first instance of such a collapse in seven decades on Australian soil.Opting to bat first on a pitch with significant grass cover, Bumrah's decision surprised many and quickly came under scrutiny as India's top order crumbled. The Australian pacers exploited the conditions masterfully, with Josh Hazlewood (4/29) and Mitchell Starc (2/14) wreaking havoc in their opening spells.Youngsters Yashasvi Jaiswal and Devdutt Padikkal fell without scoring, while Virat Kohli (5) was undone by a short delivery from Hazlewood. KL Rahul offered some resistance with a patient 26 off 74 balls, but a contentious caught-behind decision off Starc’s bowling cut short his innings.Debutant Nitish Reddy showcased admirable grit, top-scoring with 41, and Rishabh Pant provided a brief counterattack with a daring 37, which included a remarkable six. Their 48-run partnership was the only substantial stand in the innings, but wickets continued to fall regularly, and India were bowled out for 150 in just 49.4 overs.Faced with defending a modest total, India’s bowlers responded emphatically. Bumrah led the charge, dismantling Australia’s top order with a lethal spell of 4/17 in 10 overs. He began by trapping debutant Nathan McSweeney (10) leg-before with a sharp nip-backer. Usman Khawaja (8) was squared up by a delivery from around the wicket, with Virat Kohli making no mistake in the slips after earlier dropping Marnus Labuschagne. Steven Smith was dismissed for a duck by an unplayable delivery that trapped him plumb in front.Debutant Harshit Rana also made his mark, bowling Travis Head (11) with a delivery that deviated to dislodge the off-bail. Mohammed Siraj added to Australia’s woes with a fiery spell, claiming the crucial wicket of Labuschagne, who endured a torturous 52-ball stay for just two runs. Siraj also removed Mitchell Marsh, with KL Rahul completing a sharp catch. By stumps, Australia had slumped to 67/7, leaving India in command despite their first-innings struggles.","India vs Australia 1st Test match takes place at Optus Stadium, Perth.

"World Chess Championship: D Gukesh vs Ding Liren: Deception, play-acting, et al - The other side of the chequered game",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/d-gukesh-vs-ding-liren-deception-play-acting-et-al-the-other-side-of-the-chequered-game/articleshow/115584143.cms,"D Gukesh and Ding Liren

Poker-faced Gukesh, expressive Ding a study in contrasts

China's Ding Liren is already being hailed a moral victor, even before the first chess piece has moved in his World Chess Championship match against D Gukesh that starts in Singapore from Monday.For, despite the general perception of Chinese being inscrutable and stoic, the chess community is almost united in their assertion that the 32-year-old World No. 23 is not faking his mental vulnerability and that it is not his strategy to lure Gukesh into complacency.Elite GM Levon Aronian told TOI: ""Ding is not a tricky guy. I don't see that. He may not be in the best state, it is maybe caused by the lingering effects of the Covid pandemic or him not being able to play for a long period. But he is going to fight it out. He won't come to Singapore and resign, no.""But what is also clear that all of the chances are on Gukesh's side,"" Aronian reiterated.RB Ramesh, coach and R Praggnanandhaa's mentor, too provided some insight. ""Ding is genuinely suffering,"" he said, ""When Prag faced Ding in January, I remember him telling me after the game, ‘His hands were shivering while making the moves.' Something is not right with Ding. And playing against youngsters makes him even more stressful. So, he won't enjoy this match.""Gukesh's early coach Vishnu Prasanna said, ""You start doubting Ding when he says, ‘I am not afraid of losing but I am afraid of losing badly'. There is no need to say that.""Is Ding being too forthright? Gukesh has said he is prepared to play the best version of Ding, eliminating concerns of complacency.Faking, or deception, is not only allowed in sport but often marvelled at due to its brilliance in execution, and impact. But in chess, a cerebral sport, this feigning is so subtle that it goes unnoticed by the spectators, many watching the board and not the players.In his 2008 title match in Bonn, Viswanathan Anand famously scored two wins with black against Vladimir Kramnik . In one of those wins, he had prepared an entire line. Conventional wisdom said that it was better for white. But the Indian genius had found an exciting initiative with black.The trick lay in the fact that during the game, Anand had to give the impression of being ""out of the book"" and trying to attain equality. For, even a hint of the line being prepared would have alerted Kramnik and he would have deviated to a safer territory. Talk about being poker faced!Soft signals too are important in the game. Anand had said elite players won't need a cheating gadget but just a small hint — eg. a chess engine's evaluation number (plus 1, minus 2, etc.) — is enough to take the position to the desired territory. Gukesh is unlikely to give an inch to Ding in terms of body language. For, he is poker faced almost all the time, giving away nothing, making it quite difficult to judge whether he is placed better or not. But some players, Garry Kasparov , famously, are expressive and can convert that into a tool of gamesmanship.It includes removing the wristwatch, pressing the chess clock harder or moving the pieces forcefully, sipping water, rubbing their faces with their hands, making expressions with eyes and holding eye contact. Anand had said the players also learn to decipher breathing signals from the opponents.While all this doesn't change the board position, it can influence the course of the game in a big way. Such novelty is not announced. In chess, that bubbly must be uncorked without noise.","Ding Liren is already being hailed a moral victor, even before the first chess piece has moved in his World Chess Championship match against D Gukesh.

On dramatic Day 1, captain Bumrah stars with 4-wicket haul to leave Oz gasping for air as India fight fire with fire after being bowled out for 150; hosts reeling at 67/7

'It was a great feeling': Debutant Nitish Reddy on getting cap from idol Virat Kohli

India captain Jasprit Bumrah showed ample evidence of the endless spirit in his heart and the freakish skill in his bowling bones as he brutalized Australia with his initial spell of 6-2-9-3. With the shadows of the stands engulfing Perth's Optus Stadium, he even returned later on Day One to dismiss his opposite number, Pat Cummins , to end the day with 4/17.It left the hosts reeling at 67/7. As many as 17 wickets fell on Friday, on a surface that offered liberal seam and bounce.That was after Bumrah himself had made a questionable call at the toss of electing to bat on a grassy pitch where India got bundled out for 150 at the stroke of tea. Josh Hazlewood (4/29) and Mitchell Starc (2/14) suffocated the Indian batters by bowling a relentless line and length and Mitchell Marsh showed that his West Australian teammate Cam Green's injury-forced absence wouldn't affect Australia's team balance.'The Bison', as Marsh is nicknamed for his broad shoulders, trundled in post lunch to send back Dhruv Jurel and Washington Sundar to offer the legendary pace trio of Cummins, Starc and Hazlewood a solid helping hand.If the first two sessions were a setback for the Indians, the final session was all about their fightback, and it was Bumrah that made it possible. He dismissed debutant Nathan McSweeney LBW by bowling fuller and successfully reviewing a decision adjudged not out by Richard Kettleborough.After a few unsuccessful overs from over the wicket to the stubborn Aussie lefthanded opener Usman Khawaja, Bumrah switched to round the stumps and opened Khawaja up to have him edging to Virat Kohli at second slip. Kohli, who had dropped Marnus Labuschagne off the second ball that the batter faced, made no mistake this time.The next ball, Bumrah dismissed India's perennial nemesis Steve Smith LBW when the batter indulged in his customary shuffle to meet the ball, but the 140.5 kmph thunderbolt seamed in sharply, skidded and struck him plumb in front. Harshit Rana, who was one of the two debutants India fielded along with Nitish Kumar Reddy, then castled the tormentor of India's dreams in global events, Travis Head. Rana's wobble seam delivery in the high 130s from round the stumps came in with the angle, hit the seam and moved 1.36 degrees away after pitching. Head had no chance in hell playing that one, especially sans footwork.Mohammed Siraj, bowling with better rhythm than he has shown in the past six weeks, played his part too, sending back Mitchell Marsh and Marnus Labuschagne after a painful 52-ball stay in which the Queenslander managed just two. In terms of turnarounds in moods and fortunes, this was as emphatic as it could get after Indian batters once again floundered to be dismissed in 49.4 overs, giving catching practice to men behind the sticks.Nine of them perished to catches in the slips or the 'keeper. Starc first accounted for Yashasvi Jaiswal as the batter did exactly what one is told not to do at Perth, drive on the rise, loosely. He was caught by McSweeney in the gully. Devdutt Padikkal, who was roped in as a makeshift No. 3 to replace the injured Shubman Gill, was nicked off by the metronomic Josh Hazlewood for a 23-ball duck.Virat Kohli walked in at 2-14 and employed an aggressive forward press technique with interception points earlier than all his previous outings. But Hazlewood got one to lift from a length to devour the Indian star for another single digit score.The much maligned and heavily trolled KL Rahul ironically looked the best batter on view as he defended stoutly and left judiciously. His controversial caught behind for 26 off Starc sunk India's hopes of going into lunch just three down. Rishabh Pant (37) and Nitish Kumar Reddy counterattacked for an entertaining 48-run stand, with Pant's falling scoop off Cummins over fine leg for six making it to the few batting highlights of a day dominated by bowlers.Both were enterprising against offspinner Nathan Lyon, hitting him out of the attack. Cummins, though, dismissed both close to tea. The Aussie skipper, however, would be disappointed with his returns of 67 from 15.4 on a pitch that offered so much help.He would also be annoyed at not reviewing a caught-behind appeal of Reddy off Starc when the debutant was still new to the wicket, as his 41 could prove decisive in a Test that is low-scoring and fast-moving.",Jasprit Bumrah takes 4-17 to leave Australia reeling at 67-7 on Day 1. India bowled out for 150 at the stroke of tea on a grassy pitch in Perth. Josh Hazlewood (4/29) and Mitchell Starc (2/14) suffocated the Indian batters.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115582967,imgsize-134270,width-400,resizemode-4/115582967.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Looking to secure a back-to-back World Test Championship final berth, reigning champions Australia collide with powerhouse India in the marquee Border-Gavaskar Trophy that commenced from November 22 in Perth.With India suffering a shock home series whitewash to New Zealand recently, the race to the WTC final spot has now spiced up with as many as five teams vying for a place in the finale at Lord's in June next year.However, Australia sit pretty at the top of the WTC table at the moment with a solid 8 wins in 12 matches in the current 2023-25 cycle.After India's unprecedented loss to the Kiwis, second-placed Aussies jumped to the top of the table and currently have 90 points from 12 games and a percentage point of 62.50.But this doesn't guarantee the champions a spot in the final yet as they still need to win a minimum of four of their remaining 7 matches against India (5 Tests at home) and Sri Lanka (2 Tests away).In the ongoing cycle, Australia have been a force to reckon with but they too have had a couple of shock results coming their way. While the West Indies stunned them in their own backyard, the Aussies also drew the Ashes in England despite having a 2-0 lead.As Australia now gear up for their last leg of this WTC cycle, here's a look at how they have fared so far in the third edition of the WTC:1st Test - Birmingham, June 16-20 -2nd Test - Lord's, London, June 28-July 02 -3rd Test - Leeds, July 06-09 -4th Test - Manchester, July 19-23 -5th Test - The Oval, London, July 27-31 -1st Test - Perth, December 14-17 -2nd Test - Melbourne, December 26-29 -3rd Test - Sydney, January 3-6, 2024 -1st Test - Adelaide, January 17-19 -2nd Test - Brisbane, January 25-28 -1st Test - Wellington, February 29-March 03 -2nd Test - Christchurch, March 8-11 -Currently at the top of the table, Australia still need four wins if they are to defend their title and they can have a best possible finish of 76.32 percentage points.This means that even if Australia end their home series against India with a 2-2 result, they will still have two Tests against a relatively weaker Sri Lankan side next year to make it to the final.",Reigning champions Australia face off with India in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

It was the best doubles of our lives.""For Britain it felt like a massive opportunity missed to win the competition for the first time and reach the final for the first time since losing to the United States in 1981.After Raducanu fought off the hard-hitting Hruncakova to seal her third singles win on the spin, Britain's number one Boulter, who like Raducanu had not lost a set in the ties against Germany and Canada, seemed in control.The world number 24 cruised the first set 6-2 but Sramkova then found another level to seize command of the second.She led 4-1 and although Boulter clawed it back to 4-4, Sramkova kept her country in the hunt by taking it to a decider.Sramkova carried the momentum into the third set to lead 3-1 but again Boulter fought back, cheered on by a sizeable British contingent in the small arena, to make it 3-3.It was Sramkova who kept her nerve though and at 4-5 down, Boulter served a double fault to give her opponent match points and she then struck a ball tamely wide to end the contest.Mihalikova and Hruncakova then took apart a disappointing British doubles duo to book Slovakia's place in Wednesday's showdown when they will again be big underdogs.Italy will be led by world number four Jasmine Paolini who will also partner Sara Errani, with whom she won gold at the Paris Olympics, in the doubles.""We are underdogs again but our confidence is growing,"" Liptak, in charge since 2009, said.""It's a dream, I've been a captain for many years and this was my dream to play in the final.""",Slovakia reach the Billie Jean King Cup final as doubles pairing Tereza Mihalikova and Viktoria Hruncakova complete a stunning comeback victory.
