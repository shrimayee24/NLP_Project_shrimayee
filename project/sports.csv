That's exactly what happened on December 26, 2003 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground .With a draw in Brisbane and victory in Adelaide, India were in the lead and the Aussies were desperate for a win.The third Test at the MCG got underway with Sourav Ganguly winning the toss and opting to bat first.

Getting hit twice on the helmet by bouncers off Brett Lee , didn't deter Sehwag one bit. His punches off the back foot through the covers, his clean hits down the ground and his flicks through mid-wicket bore the stamp of an onslaught of an opener looking to make a statement.Sehwag's stroke play that day had all the trademark shots, especially his hits through the covers with his feet absolutely nowhere near the ball. But the bat was so perfectly positioned that the ball raced through the infield of the MCG that was undergoing renovation at that time.Sehwag got to his fifty off 78 balls and reached his fifth Test century off 144 deliveries with a flick through mid-wicket.

Sehwag's eyes lit up: chance to get to a maiden 200 with a six. He swung his willow but slightly mistimed it and the ball went straight to Nathan Bracken who was the lone fielder at deep mid-wicket.Sehwag's 195-run onslaught came off 233 deliveries and was studded with 5 sixes and 25 fours.

's coaching setup and dealing with injury...

Excerpts from an exclusive interview...

Status of your injury?

So many teams seem to be in a transition phase. Do you perceive any difference in terms of approach, intensity and skill set in the younger crop of players who've been shaped by a lot of franchise-based

T20 cricket

?

England picked a lot of multi-skilled players for the T20I series against Australia. Does the

's 'impact player' rule seem at odds with this trend?

England's new all-format coach Brendon McCullum recently said that you've been 'a bit miserable at times' because of injury and form issues...

Are we reverting to an age of a single head coach across formats, instead of specialized white-ball and red-ball roles?

With so many people around to provide input, do you see the captain's role diminishing in future, especially in T20 format?

Australia tour

It's not a good time to be Jos Buttler. England's regular white-ball captain is grappling with a right calf injury that has made him sit out for long, even as a Harry Brook-led England prepare to take on Australia in the upcoming ODI series.Buttler, though, is not one to merely sit on the sidelines.Along with his rehab, he has been meticulously planning the way forward for the team under new head coach Brendon McCullum , who takes over next January.I haven't set a timeline for my return but I'm feeling good. I've had a couple of setbacks along the way in my rehab, which is a shame. I just want to get it completely right. It's been a long time now since I've been at the intensity of playing some top-level cricket.It's that fearless nature these youngsters have. They seem very international-ready, without having had games behind them or taking the time to adapt. That's been one of the things for all countries, really, since the franchise competitions began. Playing in these tournaments has sort of bridged the gap between domestic and international cricket.These (franchise events) are condensed tournaments offering a higher standard of crick et and sort of preparing younger players for what international cricket will be like, even in terms of playing in front of big crowds or the media inter actions, etc. So, these guys seem ready-made for international cricket and they aren't taking that long to adapt, which is a great sign.Even before the 'impact player' rule came in, there were a lot of cricketers wanting to be involved, wanting to impact the game with both bat and ball. Allrounders traditionally have been crucial for cricket teams, to lengthen the batting lineup, provide balance and different bowling options. Allrounders are not a luxury but a necessity. Having multi-skilled players is a huge benefit. I know in the IPL people think the 'impact-player' rule is sort of taking something away from the allrounders, but they still play a huge part. They're crucial to balancing the side.I saw that, it's tongue in cheek! I've had some good chats with 'Baz' and I'm really excited to get the chance to work with him. He was always one of those players that I looked up to. He's had a huge impact with the Test team and now, being the all-format coach is great for English cricket.There are pluses and minuses to both. Having that one guy across formats can have that consistent messaging, of course. At the time Brendon took over as Test coach along with Matthew Mott (former white-ball coach), the schedule for English cricket was incredibly busy. It looked impossible for one man to do it all. We had to balance that out. Now it's obviously gone back to having that single head coach, but you'll still have to be smart with schedules. There might be times when 'Baz' needs to step out for a series and one of the assistant coaches can take charge.I don't see that at all. There's more data but making those calls on the field is still crucial. It's such a short game, every ball is important, saving one run or two runs here and there can go a long way to winning a game. Making those calls as captain is vital. There's just more information for the captain if you need it.",England's regular white-ball captain is grappling with a right calf injury.

WATCH:

NEW DELHI: The rivalry between India and Pakistan in cricket is unparalleled, captivating fans worldwide whenever these two nations clash on the field.One memorable incident occurred during the ICC T20 World Cup 2012, when former Indian all-rounder Suresh Raina silenced Pakistani supporters in his own unique way.In a Super 8s encounter at the jam-packed R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, Pakistan batted first but struggled against India's bowling attack.Lakshmipathy Balaji and R Ashwin were the standout performers, taking three and two wickets respectively. Pakistan's innings lacked substantial partnerships, with only Shoaib Malik managing a top score of 28.The crucial moment came when Pakistan's captain, Mohammad Hafeez, was caught behind off Virat Kohli 's bowling for 15.After Hafeez's wicket, Umar Akmal provided some resistance, scoring a quick-fire 21 off 18 balls.When he hit Irfan Pathan for a massive six over midwicket, the Pakistani fans erupted in chants of ""Pakistan! Pakistan!"".However, their celebration was short-lived.As Ashwin came into the attack, MS Dhoni strategically placed Suresh Raina at the midwicket region.Umar attempted another big shot off Ashwin but miscued it, and Raina took a fantastic catch.In a moment of triumph, Raina cupped his ear towards the crowd, implying that he couldn't hear their cheers anymore.Umar, visibly frustrated, walked back to the pavilion as Pakistan were bowled out for a modest 128 in 19.4 overs.In response, India's chase was led by a brilliant unbeaten knock of 78 off 61 balls from Virat Kohli. With support from Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh, India comfortably reached the target in just 17 overs, securing an 8-wicket victory.Despite the win, India finished third in the Super 8s and did not progress to the semifinals of the tournament.",India beat Pakistan by eight wickets at ICC T20 World Cup 2012 in Colombo.

How Sachin Tendulkar mastered the upper cut shot to perfection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/how-sachin-tendulkar-mastered-the-upper-cut-shot-to-perfection/articleshow/113377586.cms,"NEW DELHI: Sachin Tendulkar , one of the greatest cricketers of all time, was known for a wide array of classic shots that demonstrated his technical brilliance and adaptability.Tendulkar's shot-making was a perfect blend of technical mastery and timing. His ability to play a wide range of strokes against all types of bowling made him one of the most feared and respected batsmen in cricket .Tendulkar had one of the most refined techniques in cricket. His balance, footwork, and head position were exemplary. He made sure to get his body in the right position before playing a shot, whether against pace or spin. His compactness at the crease allowed him to play both on the front and back foot with ease, making him equally strong in defense and attack.Tendulkar popularized the uppercut, particularly during the latter part of his career. It involved slicing a short-pitched delivery over the slips or third-man boundary. It became a potent weapon, especially against fast bowlers.There is a video doing the rounds on the internet where Tendulkar talks about how he came up with the upper cut shot and how he mastered it to perfection.Talking about facing short-pitched deliveries from pacers, Tendulkar says in the video, ""We were asked to leave the ball any shorter than that, then to let the ball go, because you cannot be on top of the ball to something which is there. I mean if you look to keep it down then it's exactly at a catching height where the fielders are.""Tendulkar continues, ""So in 2001, we were playing South Africa in Bloemfontein and I thought being on top of the ball is not helping us score runs, why not get under the ball and play over the slip cordon in Test cricket. In Test cricket, very rarely you would find a third man in place, so I felt that was a scoring opportunity rather than letting the ball go because by nature instinctively I wanted to hit the ball and score runs.""Tendulkar's cut shot against fast bowlers like Brett Lee and Shoaib Akhtar was a demonstration of his brilliant hand-eye coordination, quick reflexes, and mastery of the game's technique.Both Lee and Akhtar were among the fastest bowlers of their era, regularly bowling over 150 kmph, but Tendulkar had the skill to turn their pace to his advantage, particularly with his cut shot.Brett Lee, known for his express pace and aggressive bowling, often tested batsmen with short-pitched deliveries outside off-stump. Tendulkar , with his impeccable footwork and technique, would use the pace of Lee to execute his cut shot, playing it late and using the width Lee provided. The late cut was one of Sachin's specialties against Lee, sending the ball racing past backward point or gully.Shoaib Akhtar, known as the "" Rawalpindi Express ,"" bowled with menacing speed and aggression. Tendulkar's ability to deal with Akhtar's pace was evident during the 2003 ODI World Cup and India's tour of Pakistan in 2004. Against Akhtar's fast, short-pitched deliveries outside off-stump, Tendulkar often used the cut shot to exploit the gaps between point and gully.One of the most famous moments in cricket history occurred in the 2003 World Cup when Tendulkar uppercut a short-pitched delivery from Akhtar over third man for a six. Although it was more of an uppercut than a traditional cut shot, it was another demonstration of Tendulkar's brilliance in using pace to his advantage. This shot, in particular, stands out in the minds of cricket fans for its audacity and timing.Tendulkar's ability to play the cut shot late allowed him to use the pace of the bowler, particularly against deliveries outside off-stump. His control over the shot meant that even if it went in the air, it was over the fielders and into the stands.Tendulkar would quickly move his feet into position, getting inside the line of the ball to either play the shot late or early depending on the bounce and pace. This allowed him to manipulate the field with precision.Even against bowlers as fast as Brett Lee and Shoaib Akhtar, Sachin displayed exceptional control, ensuring that the ball was placed in the gaps, often racing to the boundary with little effort.Tendulkar's cut shot against these two fiery fast bowlers exemplified his ability to neutralize extreme pace with finesse and technical superiority. These moments, especially his uppercut shots, remain etched in cricketing folklore.Tendulkar's shot-making was a mix of flawless technique, immense mental strength, and the ability to adapt to every situation. This is what made him one of the most complete and successful batsmen in cricket history.","Sachin Tendulkar's shot-making was a perfect blend of technical mastery and timing.

The story behind Australian great Ricky Ponting's nickname 'Punter',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/the-story-behind-australian-great-ricky-pontings-nickname-punter/articleshow/113402163.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ricky Ponting , the legendary Australian cricketer, earned the nickname ' Punter ' early in his cricketing career.The origin of the nickname is tied to Ponting's love for betting on horse races and greyhounds, a common pastime in Australia.In Australian slang, a ""punter"" is someone who places bets, especially on horse races, which made it a fitting nickname for the young cricketer.Ponting grew up in Tasmania, where he was introduced to cricket at a young age by his family. However, aside from his passion for cricket, he developed a fondness for betting.During his early days in the Tasmanian cricket circuit, Ponting would often spend his downtime at the racetrack or watching races on television.He wasn't just a casual observer; he enjoyed the thrill of placing bets and the excitement that came with it. His teammates and coaches took notice of this hobby, and it wasn't long before they started calling him 'Punter'.The nickname was further popularized by Shane Warne, another Australian cricket icon, who was known for giving his teammates nicknames.Warne and Ponting shared a close friendship, and Warne, being a keen observer of personalities, found 'Punter' to be a perfect fit for Ponting's betting enthusiasm.The nickname stuck, and soon it became a part of Ponting's identity in the cricketing world.Punters are often seen as risk-takers, which in many ways reflected Ponting's approach to cricket.As a batsman and later as a captain, he was known for his aggressive and fearless style.Ponting wasn't afraid to take calculated risks on the field, whether it was in his attacking batting or his bold decisions as captain. This risk-taking trait, aligned with the essence of a punter, made the nickname even more apt.As Ponting's career flourished, 'Punter' became more than just a nickname; it was a symbol of his personality both on and off the field.It embodied his competitive spirit, his willingness to take chances, and his love for the thrill of the game, whether it was cricket or betting on a race.Even after retiring from professional cricket, the name 'Punter; has stayed with him, a testament to the early days of his career and the traits that defined him as one of the greatest cricketers of all time.","Ricky Ponting earned the nickname 'Punter' early in his cricketing career.

India's lack of depth in singles and questionable team selection stood glaringly exposed on Sunday after Sweden completed a 4-0 rout over them in the Davis Cup World Group I tie in Stockholm.Trailing 0-2 after losing both the singles on Saturday, India faced a herculean task at the Royal Tennis Hall indoor stadium, and they simply capitulated.Ramkumar Ramanathan and Sriram Balaji went down 3-6, 4-6 against Andre Goransson and Filip Bergevi in an hour and 19 minutes in the doubles before Siddharth Vishwakarma, playing his maiden tie, was overwhelmed by Elias Ymer 6-2, 6-2 in the inconsequential reverse singles.The dead fifth rubber was called off, saving Rohit Rajpal 's team from further embarrassment.The result meant Sweden advanced to the Qualifiers next year while India are back to World Group Playoffs. The win also saw Sweden maintain their unbeaten record against India in six meetings, stretching back to their first encounter in a World Group quarterfinal in Bengaluru in 1985.The Scandinavians have lost only two rubbers and just one of them - Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi's win over Jonas Bjorkman and Simon Aspelin, Sweden's current captain, in their last meeting in New Delhi in 2005 - was a live one.The chemistry between Goransson and Bergevi, both 30-year-olds but ranked 66 and 125 respectively, belied the fact that they have played only five times as a team in Davis Cup and their last pairing on the pro circuit was in 2018 in the Futures.""We have known each other from the age of 10, that's 20 years now,"" Bergevi said.Ramkumar and Balaji speak the same language and hail from the same state, too, but the partnership lacked the intensity and spark the Swedes displayed.More interestingly, Goransson revealed both play on the ad-court and yet, such is the understanding between them that it didn't stop them from dominating the Indians on Sunday.The home pair saved a breakpoint early on in the third game before breaking Ramkumar to go up 4-2 before taking the first set.Goransson and Bergevi then had a tiny opening in the third game of the second set when they put Balaji's serve under pressure.They then turned up the heat in the seventh game, again on Balaji's serve, producing two devastating service returns down the line in a row. The Indians saved two breakpoints before Balaji put a volley on Bergevi's service return into the net to go down 3-4. There was no coming back from there.India's Davis Cup captain Rohit Rajpal reacted angrily to criticism after the team's abject surrender to Sweden in Stockholm. ""You know, since I took over, they have been saying something negative in order to get a reaction out of me,"" Rajpal said when a reporter mentioned about comments in social media calling for a change in captaincy. ""I am here for my country. I have just one thing to say (to critics on the outside), shut up. If you really care, then don't sit there. Get out of here.""","India lose 4-0 to Sweden in Davis Cup World Group I tie in Stockholm. India's lack of depth in singles and questionable team selection exposed.

Davis Cup: India fire blanks to concede 2-0 lead against Sweden,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/davis-cup-india-fire-blanks-to-concede-2-0-lead-against-sweden/articleshow/113361269.cms,"Serve-and-volley strategy fails to yield result as Balaji and Ramkumar lose their singles tiesPUNE: India's gameplan to counter Sweden 's solidity from the baseline with serve-and volley fell flat as they conceded a 2-0 lead to the hosts in the Davis Cup World Group I tie in Stockholm on Saturday.Elias Ymer, a former World No. 105, currently ranked 238 and a regular on the ATP Tour, proved to be too good for doubles specialist Sriram Balaji as he won 6-4, 6-2 to put Sweden ahead on the indoor hard court at the Royal Tennis Hall .Leo Borg , the 21-year-old son of legendary Bjorn Borg, played way above his current ranking of 603 while taming the big serving Ramkumar Ramanathan 6-3, 6-4 in the second singles. It was the younger Borg's first win in the Davis Cup, having lost all the three matches he had played earlier. And it came in his first Cup match at home with dad watching, which made it even more special.""It was a great feeling, I could really feel the support of the fans today. And having my dad out there, I feel really happy,"" Borg said.For the Indian team, the first day rout exposed the lack of depth in their ranks. With the country's No. 1 player Sumit Nagal , currently ranked 82, as well as top doubles player Yuki Bhambri unavailable, their hopes of beating Sweden - who are 5-0 in head to head - for the first time ever were dashed even before the first ball was hit.And the ball proved to be a key factor.Captain Rohit Rajpal had spoken in the lead-up to the tie about the surface playing ""medium"" - neither fast nor slow - and how it might suit his players. But the Indians didn't account for the ball changing its character during the course of play.""After a few points, the ball was becoming fluffy and sitting,"" Ramkumar said. ""He (Borg) was staying really back and coming up with great returns."" Rajpal said, quite helplessly, ""Well, we had to do something different. We are not going to beat them from the back of the court. It was a bad day at the office.""The captain also made a pointed remark: ""The idea was not to come in at the net at the right moments, not for the sake of going to the net.""So, while the visitors aimed to take the fight to the hosts and put the pressure on them, the script played out just the opposite way.Ymer, son of Ethiopian immigrants, broke Balaji in the very first game and that set the tone for the rest of the day. Ramkumar, formerly 111 and adept at serve and volley, broke Borg early on but it proved to be false dawn. It had more to do with Borg's nerves.","India's serve-and-volley strategy fails to yield result as Balaji and Ramkumar lose their singles ties.
