While talking about the Miami Heat alum‚Äôs cancer diagnosis, Gabrielle Union shared one of her biggest fears. She said,""It was hard to navigate publicly the things that were happening privately. Even though we all know plenty of survivors, immediately you go to death, immediately we all internalize his cancer. It's our cancer.""According to Union, she was scared and even worried that she would have to raise the kids in Dwyane Wade‚Äôs absence. The Bring It On star further mentioned,""I'll speak for myself when I say that the decisions that he was making hurt me about his cancer. It felt like, 'Oh, you're trying to kill me.And I'm going to be alone raising these kids. It's a very selfish response that I had, and it caused all kinds of problems, but [so did] his need for secrecy about his cancer decisions. It just starts sowing the seeds of distrust.""After coming across the life-threatening tumor in Wade‚Äôs kidney, Gabrielle Union felt as if the NBA icon was almost near to death. She explained,""It just felt like he was trying to leave us‚Äînot in a marital sense, but a life and death sense. By the time he got it removed, I felt like we were more on the same page.""Dwyane Wade underwent a kidney removal surgery in December 2023. Reportedly, his 40% right kidney was removed due to the cancer diagnosis.

According to the Hollywood star, within 9 years of marriage their marriage almost hit rock bottom when the NBA star was diagnosed with kidney cancer. She revealed,‚ÄúIt was year nine of our marriage and ... year nine was very hard. When you mention year nine being hard, he hadn‚Äôt revealed his cancer diagnosis and his own cancer journey, so now we can put it in more context.‚ÄùShe further elaborated,""Obviously him getting that diagnosis was traumatic for him: Being faced with your own mortality in your early 40s, and you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòAm I going to be here to see my family? Who am I without this big life, and without this healthy body? But you also don‚Äôt understand the journey and the toll that it takes on your marriage, on your family, on your kids.‚ÄùAfter being married for 11 long years, Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union share a daughter named Kaavia via surrogacy. The Hollywood star has struggled with health issues which left her with no option but to go ahead with surrogacy.

Travis Kelce Shares His First Reaction About Taylor Swift Engagement Ring Before NFL Game

Why the friendship may not recover anytime soon

The once-unshakable friendship between Taylor Swift and Blake Lively is under the microscope again as legal battles surrounding It Ends With Us spill over into the personal lives of Hollywood‚Äôs biggest names. What began as a lawsuit between Lively and director Justin Baldoni has now dragged Swift into the fray, sparking speculation about whether her bond with Lively can survive the fallout.Although It Ends With Us premiered more than a year ago, its book-to-screen adaptation continues to generate drama. Blake Lively filed a lawsuit against the production company, and in the process, Taylor Swift was deposed. Matters escalated when a process server attempting to deliver legal documents to Swift was arrested for trespassing outside Travis Kelce ‚Äôs Kansas City home.An anonymous insider told Radar Online, ‚ÄúFor Taylor, that arrest was it. She believes Blake opened the door to all of this, and watching a process server get handcuffed at Travis‚Äô home because of Blake‚Äôs lawsuit was humiliating. It has ended whatever was left of their bond.‚ÄùThis alleged breaking point comes as Swift and Kelce prepare for the next chapter of their lives together. With their engagement making headlines worldwide, Swift reportedly views the incident as not just embarrassing but also invasive, adding pressure to protect her fianc√© from unwanted drama.Sources claim Swift feels betrayed by being dragged into what she considers Lively‚Äôs personal feud with Baldoni. Another insider suggested, ‚ÄúTaylor has dealt with stalkers and security scares for years, but being dragged into Blake‚Äôs drama with Baldoni feels different. She sees it as betrayal. That arrest was the moment she decided she‚Äôs done.‚ÄùWhile Lively continues pursuing her legal battle and lining up new projects for 2026 and beyond, Baldoni faces an uncertain career path after his defamation case was dismissed. For Swift, however, the focus seems to have shifted to safeguarding her relationship with Kelce and distancing herself from any fallout connected to her former friend.Also Read: ‚ÄúA major rift‚Äù: Numerologist warns Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce may face challenges despite fairytale romance As both legal teams press on, the bigger question remains: can one of Hollywood‚Äôs most high-profile friendships recover from this rift, or has it quietly come to an end?",The friendship between Taylor Swift and Blake Lively is under the microscope again as legal battles surrounding It Ends With Us spill over into the personal lives of Hollywood‚Äôs biggest names.

Did a rough outing against Puka Nacua prompt Xavien Howard to suddenly retire from the NFL?



Colts face new defensive challenges without Howard



Xavien Howard, the four-time Pro Bowler, has stunned the NFL by retiring mid-season after just four games with the Indianapolis Colts. The 32-year-old cornerback, who joined the Colts in August after sitting out the 2024 season, announced his decision following a challenging performance against the Los Angeles Rams, where star receiver Puka Nacua dominated. Howard was officially placed on the Colts‚Äô reserve/retired list on Wednesday.In an emotional Instagram post, Howard explained his choice to step away from the game. ‚ÄúWhen I was away from the game in 2024, I fell in love with taking my kids to school, doing activities with them and watching them grow up,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúUp to that point I had always put my family after football. I‚Äôm no longer willing to do so. So today I am retiring from the National Football League. My purpose has been fulfilled in this sport, but my kids are more important to me than football. I‚Äôve had a hell of a career, and even though it‚Äôs ending in a unique way, I‚Äôm cool with that because for once I am putting my family first and I‚Äôm proud about that decision.‚ÄùHoward‚Äôs retirement underscores a growing trend of players prioritizing family over the game. After nine NFL seasons, including eight with the Miami Dolphins, Howard leaves behind a decorated career highlighted by four Pro Bowls, a first-team All-Pro selection in 2020, and two seasons leading the league in interceptions.Howard‚Äôs final games with the Colts included four starts, 11 tackles, and one fumble recovery. However, he struggled in coverage, particularly against Nacua, allowing 112 yards and a touchdown on seven completions from 10 targets. Pro Football Focus ranked him 156th out of 164 corners this season, and his 36.1 PFF grade was among the lowest in the league.Indianapolis, now 3‚Äì1, will face the Raiders at Lucas Oil Stadium this Sunday without Howard in the secondary.

Jonathan Kuminga





Themay have securedon a fresh two-year, $48.5 million deal this offseason, but that doesn‚Äôt guarantee the young forward‚Äôs long-term future in San Francisco. In fact, multiple reports suggest the 6-foot-7 forward could be moved to the Miami Heat before the 2025-26 NBA trade deadline.Bleacher Report‚Äôs Andy Bailey has outlined a potential midseason trade scenario where Jonathan Kuminga heads to Miami in exchange for former Warrior Andrew Wiggins.‚ÄúWould the Warriors be interested in an Andrew Wiggins reunion,‚Äù Bailey wrote. ‚ÄúThey parted ways with one of the most important players from their 2022 title run to land Jimmy Butler, but the situation with Miami has evolved to the point that it should be interested in stockpiling younger talent.‚Äù (H/t Sporting News)Bailey further explained that Miami‚Äôs current build around Tyler Herro and Bam Adebayo lacks the ceiling of a true contender without Butler. Focusing on younger players like Jaime Jaquez Jr., Nikola Joviƒá, Kel‚Äôel Ware, Kasparas Jakuƒçionis, and potentially Kuminga would be a step toward long-term stability.For the Golden State Warriors , reuniting with Wiggins offers familiarity and flexibility. His ability to play within Golden State‚Äôs read-and-react system gives him an immediate advantage.Key potential roles for Wiggins if the trade goes through:‚Ä¢ Sixth man behind the starting core, similar to DeMar DeRozan‚Äôs role suggestion‚Ä¢ Option to play as a jumbo 2-guard alongside Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green, and Al Horford‚Ä¢ Reliable 3-and-D presence to space the floor and defend multiple positionsWiggins‚Äô consistency from beyond the arc and defensive versatility could prove more valuable for Golden State than investing further in Kuminga‚Äôs development.This isn‚Äôt the first time Jonathan Kuminga and the Heat have been connected. As far back as December 2024, reports tied him to Miami when Golden State‚Äôs season began to unravel. Speculation grew that a swap involving Jimmy Butler and Kuminga would reshape both franchises.However, on February 5, the Golden State Warriors instead packaged Andrew Wiggins in a blockbuster deal to land Butler. That decision shifted the narrative but also left unresolved tension between Kuminga and the organization.If Golden State revisits trade talks midseason, sending Kuminga to Miami in exchange for Wiggins could check multiple boxes:‚Ä¢ Short-term: Keep the roster competitive with veterans who fit seamlessly‚Ä¢ Long-term: Avoid committing major money to Kuminga while stabilizing the rotationKuminga‚Äôs future with the Golden State Warriors appears uncertain despite his lucrative new contract. With the team prioritizing stability around Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler, reuniting with Wiggins may offer Golden State the balance it needs for another playoff push.

Level of concern with McDavid potentially leaving?

Connor McDavid‚Äôs dilemma is to win now or cap later

Connor McDavid‚Äôs future with the Edmonton Oilers has once again taken center stage in NHL contract discussions. After Minnesota Wild forward Kirill Kaprizov secured an eight-year, $136 million extension this week, the attention immediately shifted to what Edmonton‚Äôs superstar captain might demand when his next deal comes up. The Oilers are already weighed down by big-money contracts that could limit how far they can go for McDavid.While McDavid is expected to set the market whenever he signs, Edmonton‚Äôs financial structure complicates the picture. The Oilers are currently locked into expensive long-term commitments. Leon Draisaitl‚Äôs $14 million salary, Evan Bouchard‚Äôs double-digit deal, and Darnell Nurse‚Äôs $9.25 million contract already consume a large portion of the cap. On top of that, goaltender Stuart Skinner is due for a significant raise in the near future.NHL insider Frank Seravalli highlighted this challenge, stating, ""They can't, I don't think the Edmonton Oilers can afford to go more. In fact, I don't think on their cap that they can really even afford to go 17 million, um, because of all the other deals that they've got."" That kind of financial squeeze makes it difficult for the Oilers to entertain numbers north of $17 million annually ‚Äî a figure that insiders believe McDavid could command.Even with the NHL‚Äôs salary cap set to climb in the coming seasons, Edmonton‚Äôs roster construction leaves little margin to maneuver.Oilers GM Stan Bowman addressed Connor McDavid‚Äôs contract situation on Wednesday, admitting there is still no clarity on whether the superstar captain will have a new deal before the regular season begins. Bowman revealed via TSN that ongoing talks with McDavid‚Äôs agent Judd Moldaver remain frequent but offered no firm timeline, stressing, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to make predictions, we‚Äôll see where it goes.‚ÄùBeyond the financial puzzle, McDavid‚Äôs decision may come down to competitiveness. The Oilers have enjoyed success over the past two years, but McDavid understands that aging players, a thin prospect pipeline, and limited draft picks can quickly derail momentum.For McDavid, the question is not simply ‚Äúhow much‚Äù but ‚Äúhow far can this team go?‚Äù He has made it clear throughout his career that chasing a Stanley Cup defines his priorities. That means Edmonton must strike a balance ‚Äî paying its franchise player while still building the depth required to compete against the league‚Äôs best.Kaprizov‚Äôs blockbuster contract raised expectations league-wide, but McDavid‚Äôs case is different. He may ultimately accept less than his maximum value if it ensures the Oilers remain contenders. At the same time, Edmonton must find creative ways to manage the salary cap or risk losing the most dominant player in the game.McDavid‚Äôs decision will shape not just the Oilers‚Äô future, but also the landscape of the NHL. His contract situation is now one of the defining storylines of the league.Also Read: Leon Draisaitl‚Äôs wife Celeste Desjardins just can‚Äôt stop reliving her dream wedding; Labels it ‚ÄúHappiest day of our lives‚Äù",Connor McDavid's contract future with the Edmonton Oilers is under intense scrutiny following Kirill Kaprizov's massive deal. The Oilers are already weighed down by big-money contracts that could limit how far they can go for McDavid.

Stacey Dales shares her personal WNBA experience



Collier‚Äôs critique highlights player frustrations



Stacey Dales, senior NFL Network reporter and former WNBA All-Star, has publicly voiced her frustration with WNBA leadership following Lynx star Napheesa Collier‚Äôs candid critique of commissioner Cathy Engelbert. Dales revealed a personal experience of feeling overlooked by the league, shedding light on long-standing concerns among former players. Her reflections come at a moment when scrutiny over Engelbert‚Äôs leadership is intensifying.Dales, who was the third overall pick in the 2002 WNBA Draft by the Washington Mystics, recalled her efforts to support the league after retirement in 2008. ‚ÄúI hosted a prominent WNBA event a couple of years ago. ‚ÄòWelcome to the league, Toronto,‚Äô‚Äù Dales wrote on X. ‚ÄúThe Toronto team intro ‚Äî it was exceptional. The TO people were amazing. I did it for free. I never once heard from Cathy or the WNBA or league in general. Nothing. Not a single bump on their social media. Frankly, it seemed like she didn‚Äôt know I played for the league at all. I walked away wondering if she even knew me. I have never heard from the league since I left the game.‚ÄùShe contrasted her WNBA experience with her time in the NFL, noting, ‚ÄúThe NFL treats me so kindly. Not like this.‚Äù After retiring from professional basketball, Dales transitioned into broadcasting, joining NFL Network in 2009, where she hosts shows including NFL Now and NFL Total Access. Her career also includes seven years as a reporter and analyst for ESPN and ABC, covering multiple sports at the highest level.Dales‚Äô comments came shortly after Napheesa Collier criticized Engelbert at her exit press conference, calling her leadership ‚Äúnegligent.‚Äù Collier revealed that conversations she had with Engelbert about league officiating in February were dismissed, with Engelbert reportedly responding, ‚ÄúWell only the losers complain about the refs.‚Äù Collier‚Äôs statement concluded with a sharp observation: ‚ÄúWe have the best players in the world. We have the best fans in the world. But right now, we have the worst leadership in the world.‚ÄùDales praised Collier‚Äôs remarks, calling them ‚Äúincredibly profound, powerful, and detailed statement from one of the league‚Äôs premier athletes and class all the way.‚Äù Her own story reinforces a broader pattern of former players feeling disconnected from the WNBA, raising questions about how the league engages with its talent and honors their contributions.Also Read: What led former Dolphins star Xavien Howard to retire after only four games with the Colts?","Stacey Dales, a former WNBA All-Star, has publicly voiced her frustration with WNBA leadership.

Justin Fields demands full accountability and discipline from players and coaches to turn close losses into wins

Explosive run game could be the key spark the Jets need to break through against tough opponents

Coach Aaron Glenn highlights Fields‚Äô unique athleticism and game-changing ability as Jets seek consistency

Justin Fields leads with energy and motivation to keep Jets‚Äô locker room positive amid early-season struggles

The New York Jets enter Week 5 still hunting for their first victory of the season, and quarterback Justin Fields insists the turnaround must begin on offense. With three of their four losses coming by a single score, Fields believes sharper execution, fewer penalties, and better ball security could be the difference between being ‚Äúclose‚Äù and finally breaking through. As the Jets prepare to host the Dallas Cowboys at MetLife Stadium, urgency is rising but so is belief that a breakthrough is near.Fields acknowledged that the Jets have not been outplayed so much as out-executed in critical moments. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve lost three games by one score,‚Äù he reflected, noting that minimizing turnovers and penalties would instantly flip narrow defeats into wins. For him, accountability extends beyond the locker room and onto the coaching staff as well. ‚ÄúTo secure those dubs, everybody has to be on the same page ‚Äî not only the players but the coaches and everyone around the building,‚Äù he said.Against recent opponents, the Jets showed flashes of a productive rushing attack that set the tone early. Fields highlighted the first drive last week where explosive runs carved through the defense, creating balance and rhythm. ‚ÄúThe run game makes my job easier,‚Äù he admitted, pointing to how sustained ground production opens lanes for both his arm and his legs.His dual-threat ability was on display with a highlight-reel 43-yard touchdown run that, according to head coach Aaron Glenn, might have covered nearly 90 yards of scrambling in total.Glenn did not hold back in applauding his quarterback‚Äôs resilience and athleticism. ‚ÄúHe never ceases to amaze me when he‚Äôs running with the ball,‚Äù the coach said. ‚ÄúBecause he‚Äôs such a big, strong man, able to elude and make people miss in space.‚Äù For Glenn, those are the kinds of plays the Jets have to build upon, knowing that Fields‚Äô improvisation can turn a stagnant drive into a game-changing moment. The challenge, however, remains sustaining that energy for four full quarters without costly lapses.As one of the team captains, Fields has leaned into his leadership role, rallying teammates through tough stretches. After Monday‚Äôs loss, he addressed the locker room to remind players that their confidence must not waver. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my job as quarterback and as one of the leaders to make sure everybody feels that energy,‚Äù he said. Fields emphasized that morale remains high despite setbacks, with the group determined to ‚Äúget back to work this week and go out there on Sunday and play ball. ‚ÄùWith the Cowboys looming, the Jets know opportunities cannot be squandered. Cleaning up mental errors, sticking to the run game, and maximizing Fields‚Äô dynamic skillset are central to their game plan. For a team that has been on the verge of victories but unable to close, Week 5 provides both a test and a chance at redemption. If Fields‚Äô message of accountability resonates, MetLife Stadium could witness the Jets‚Äô long-awaited first win of the season.Also read: Who is Jason Taylor‚Äôs wife?

Former Pakistan cricket captain Shahid Afridi has urged Mohsin Naqvi to step down from one of his two positions - either as Pakistan Cricket Board chairman or as Minister of Interior.Afridi believes Pakistan cricket requires full attention, which Naqvi cannot provide while managing both roles simultaneously.Naqvi's tenure as PCB chairman since 2024 has been marked by challenges. Under his leadership, Pakistan has struggled in home Test matches, the 2025 Champions Trophy, and now in the Asia Cup.Despite improved performance under new coach Mike Hesson, the team's showing in the 2025 Asia Cup was mixed, with victories overshadowed by three losses against India.""My request or advice to Naqvi Saheb is that these are two very important posts, and they are big jobs that need time. PCB is totally different from the Interior Ministry, so it must be kept separate,"" Afridi told Telecom Asia Sport.""It would be a big decision and should be taken as soon as possible. Pakistan cricket needs special attention and time‚Ä¶ Naqvi cannot rely totally on advisers. These advisers are taking him nowhere and he himself says that he doesn't know much about cricket. He needs to appoint good and competent advisers who know about the game.""Naqvi's responsibilities have expanded further with his appointment as chairman of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC). His leadership during the 2025 Asia Cup was marked by controversy, particularly regarding his interactions with India.The tournament's conclusion was notable for an incident during the trophy presentation. When India emerged victorious, they expressed reluctance to receive the trophy from Naqvi, citing his previous anti-India positions.In response, Naqvi left the stadium with the winners' trophy.These events have added to the growing pressure on Naqvi, who continues to balance his multiple roles in Pakistani cricket administration and government. His effectiveness in managing these diverse responsibilities has become a subject of discussion in cricket circles.","Shahid Afridi has urged Mohsin Naqvi to step down from one of his two positions.

Poll Do you think Tilak Varma's performance was crucial in winning the Asia Cup? Yes No

NEW DELHI: Winning the Asia Cup was the ""best reply"" to an aggressive opposition, middle-order batter Tilak Varma said on Tuesday, revealing how he handled initial pressure and verbal volleys from Pakistan players en route to his match-winning half-century in the final. Tilak scored an unbeaten 69 to guide India to a five-wicket victory over their arch-rivals at Dubai last Sunday.""There was some pressure and nerves initially. But I have placed my country ahead of everything else and I wanted to win the match for the country. I knew if I succumbed to the pressure at that time I would be letting down myself and 140 crore people of the country,"" Tilak said after arriving from Dubai.""I believed in the basics that I learned as a young cricketer from my coaches and executed it. The best reply to them was to win the match and that's what we did,"" he added.Tilak admitted that the Pakistan players indulged in intense sledging during the match, but he chose to remain silent while chasing 147.""After Operation Sindoor, they came hard on us. We have replied in a good way to them by playing sports the way it should be played. We lost three wickets quickly and things were a bit heated up then.""I came to bat a bit earlier than normal. But I did not say anything or play a rash shot, as it would have let the team and country down then,"" he said.However, the Hyderabadi revealed that he spoke his mind to the Pakistan players only after India surpassed the target.""During the match, I was just focusing on my basics, I was not ready to answer them. Whatever I want to tell them I told them after the match and not when the game was going on.""There were a lot of things happening in the middle but I can't reveal all of them. Those things happen in India vs Pakistan matches and they are part of the game. But our focus was on winning the match,"" he said.India needed 10 runs off the final over bowled by pacer Haris Rauf, and Tilak said he was able to stay calm under pressure.""I was calm under pressure (in the last over). I knew that I will win the game. I was just thinking about my country and was focussing on one ball at a time. I backed myself to deliver for the country and I am so proud of it,"" he added.Unsurprisingly, Tilak described the innings as one of the best of his young career.""I would rate this as one of the best innings. (Along) with this, I could also rate one more innings which I played earlier in Chennai against England (an unbeaten 72 that steered India to a two-wicket win).""Of course, playing in the Asia Cup, that too against Pakistan under pressure, is one of the greatest feelings. So, I would rate this as my one of the best innings compared to my two hundreds. This is the best feeling ever I experienced,"" he gushed.Tilak credited India‚Äôs win to partnerships on a tricky batting pitch.""I agree with Surya bhai's statement of 'no rivalry' but this is sports and we knew that they will come prepared for the final.""We were expecting that and we were prepared when they took the pace off the ball and the pitch was also not easy to bat on. We made some good partnerships and won the match and are proud of that,‚Äù he noted.After managing a tense chase successfully, Tilak was compared to Virat Kohli, the original 'chase master', but the 22-year-old remained grounded.""It is always a matter of pride when you get spoken in the same breath as a legend like Virat bhai. But my focus is just winning the matches for the country,"" he said.Tilak now has his sights set on next year's T20 World Cup at home.""I am happy that I could make India win the Asia Cup. I started playing cricket after the 2011 World Cup. The (T20) World Cup is going to take place soon. That is my real aim. I will get sleep only after I win the World Cup,"" he added.He also expressed gratitude to his childhood coaches who shaped his early career.""Everyone knows my name now, everyone knows who Tilak Varma is. But when nobody knew me, my coaches were with me, backed me big time, and have helped me build and shape my career since I was a child.""Ups and downs are a part of the game. I started at Legala Cricket Academy, and whenever I practice here, I gain confidence. I know if I'm on this soil, I'll get confidence.""My coaches, Salam (Bayash) sir and Prithvi sir, are everything to me, and they've done a lot for me. Special thanks to the Hyderabad Cricket Association and the BCCI for giving me this opportunity,"" he signed off.After the Asia Cup final, Mohsin Naqvi, ignoring protocol and common sense, insisted on presenting the trophy himself. When India refused, he arrogantly ordered the trophy and medals removed from the stadium and stormed out, leaving players and fans in confusion and spoiling what should have been a celebratory moment.","Tilak Varma says winning the Asia Cup was the ""best reply"" to an aggressive opposition.

Kelsey Mitchell explains terrifying collapse during Game 5



Indiana Fever delivered a stunning postseason fight



Indiana Fever star Kelsey Mitchell‚Äôs playoff run ended in frightening fashion during Tuesday‚Äôs Game 5 loss to the Las Vegas Aces. The All-WNBA guard collapsed midway through the third quarter of the 107‚Äì98 overtime defeat, sending shockwaves through Michelob Ultra Arena. What looked like another cruel injury for a team already decimated by health setbacks turned out to be something even more alarming ‚Äî a rare medical condition Mitchell later confirmed as rhabdomyolysis.Mitchell opened up on social media the next day, revealing that her muscles essentially shut down.‚ÄúI suffered from something called Rhabdomyolysis last night. My muscles stopped producing and reached its maximum capacity,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúI went into a sense of numbness/paralyzing feeling with no movement from my lower extremities for up to 5 to 7 seconds. I panicked because I began to think the worse when I felt I couldn‚Äôt move my legs. It was an out of body experience and I thank God for covering me at a time like that.‚ÄùThe 29-year-old guard was treated at a Las Vegas hospital and later released. She reassured fans she is moving again, though still recovering.‚ÄúToday on Oct. 1, I am walking and moving at a slow pace, but I will be fine very soon. I want to thank the Fever medical team, Vegas medical team, and the staff at the local hospital for keeping me safe. In other words, I played literally til my wheels fell off, lmao,‚Äù she added.Her refusal to leave the court on a stretcher, instead leaning on teammates as Aliyah Boston helped guide her down the tunnel, spoke volumes about her toughness. Fever coach Stephanie White initially described the episode as ‚Äúa lot of lower-body cramping,‚Äù but Mitchell‚Äôs disclosure put the frightening scene into clearer perspective.Mitchell‚Äôs collapse was the latest blow in a season where the Fever lost six players to season-ending injuries, including Caitlin Clark. Despite that, Indiana pushed the defending champions to a decisive Game 5 and nearly stole it. Boston fouled out late, yet Indiana still forced overtime before falling short.Opponents and peers showed immediate support. Four-time MVP A‚Äôja Wilson said, ‚ÄúFirst off, prayers for Kelsey Mitchell. That‚Äôs my draft partner and to see her go down like that was not good. So super prayers out to her. ‚Ä¶ I really hope the Indiana Fever continue to take care of her, because she‚Äôs a gem.‚Äù Aces coach Becky Hammon echoed, ‚ÄúNobody wants to see anyone carried off the court like that ever.‚ÄùMitchell finishes the postseason averaging 22.3 points per game.Also Read: Kelsey Mitchell injury update: Indiana Fever guard hit with devastating news in WNBA playoff elimination game","Kelsey Mitchell collapsed during Tuesday's Game 5 loss to the Las Vegas Aces.

Trump advisor says ICE will enforce at Bad Bunny‚Äôs Super Bowl show



Bad Bunny‚Äôs hesitation over U.S. shows



The 2026 Super Bowl is shaping up to be more than a game or halftime show. According to Corey Lewandowski, senior advisor at the Department of Homeland Security and longtime Trump ally, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents will be present at the event. His comments come just days after the NFL confirmed Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny as the halftime show headliner, sparking debate across political and cultural circles.In an interview on The Benny Show, Lewandowski said enforcement would not stop at stadium gates. ‚ÄúICE will have enforcement at the Super Bowl for the Bad Bunny Super Bowl halftime. There is nowhere you can provide safe haven to people who are in this country illegally. Not the Super Bowl and nowhere else,‚Äù he declared. He emphasized that ICE would be actively looking for violators. ‚ÄúWe will find you, we will apprehend you, we will put you in a detention facility and we will deport you. ‚ÄùHis remarks highlight a sharp contrast with previous administrations, framing the current approach as tougher and more aggressive. He doubled down by saying, ‚ÄúIf there are illegal aliens, I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs a concert for Johnny Smith or Bad Bunny or anybody else, we‚Äôre going to do enforcement everywhere because we are going to make Americans safe.That is a directive from the president. If you‚Äôre in this country illegally, do yourself a favor: go home. ‚ÄùBad Bunny, a three-time Grammy winner and one of the most streamed artists globally, has openly expressed concern over ICE‚Äôs presence at his shows. His upcoming Deb√≠ Tirar M√°s Fotos World Tour skips the U.S. entirely, making the 2026 Super Bowl in Santa Clara, California, his only scheduled American performance that year.In an interview with i-D Magazine, the singer explained, ‚ÄúThere were many reasons why I didn‚Äôt show up in the U.S., and none of them were out of hate‚Ä¶ But there was the issue of ‚Äî like, fucking ICE could be outside [my concert]. And it‚Äôs something that we were talking about and very concerned about.‚ÄùStill, upon being announced as the headliner, Bad Bunny framed the opportunity in celebratory terms. ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm feeling goes beyond myself. It‚Äôs for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown ‚Ä¶ this is for my people, my culture and our history,‚Äù he said.Regarding NFL's decision to bring Bad Bunny, Lewandowski said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so shameful that they‚Äôve decided to pick somebody who seems to hate America so much to represent them at the Halftime Show.‚Äù‚ÄúWe should be trying to be inclusive and not exclusive,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThere are plenty of great bands and entertainment people out there who could be playing at that show that would be bringing people together and not separating them.‚ÄùWith politics now colliding with sports and entertainment, the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show may prove as controversial as it is historic.Also Read: Taylor Swift engagement gets more glamorous as Tavia Hunt gifts a luxurious lover-coded piece that wows fans","Corey Lewandowski, a senior advisor at the Department of Homeland Security, said ICE agents will be present at the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show.

Cleveland‚Äôs quarterback room grows crowded, but fans want Shedeur Sanders



Shedeur Sanders remains the most talked-about third-string quarterback in NFL history, and the attention around him is only growing. Despite his immense popularity among fans and strong marketability‚Äîhis jersey sales rank among the league‚Äôs highest‚Äîthe Cleveland Browns continue to keep the rookie behind Dillon Gabriel and Joe Flacco on the depth chart.Head coach Kevin Stefanski confirmed that Gabriel, not Sanders, would start Cleveland‚Äôs Week 5 London matchup against the Minnesota Vikings. The decision came after Sanders had voiced his frustration earlier in the week. ‚ÄúI know if you see the quarterback play in the league right now, I know I'm capable of doing better than that,‚Äù Sanders told ESPN Cleveland on Sept. 25.But instead of responding to reporters after the announcement, Sanders mimed his answers, a move that quickly went viral. ESPN insider Adam Schefter revealed the silence was in response to Rex Ryan‚Äôs sharp criticism on national television, which had already stirred outrage from Sanders‚Äô mother, Pilar.Meanwhile, Sanders‚Äô family continues to defend him. His father, Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, believes his son will get playing time this season. His brother, Deion Sanders Jr., reposted a fiery clip of Stephen A. Smith on ‚ÄúFirst Take,‚Äù where the analyst openly questioned why the Browns are holding Sanders back.‚ÄúThey‚Äôre clamoring to see him play in Cleveland,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúThey want him on the field. They want to see what he has. ‚ÄùThe Browns‚Äô quarterback situation remains unsettled. With Deshaun Watson sidelined on the PUP list after multiple Achilles surgeries, Cleveland signed veteran Joe Flacco to steady the team. Flacco, however, was benched after four starts, paving the way for Gabriel, a third-round draft pick. Sanders, drafted two rounds later, has yet to take a snap in the regular season.Gabriel addressed the media after earning the starting job. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt wait for a perfect time, you just have to be ready,‚Äù he said. The rookie is now tasked with leading Cleveland overseas, while Sanders stays in the shadows.Still, the public pressure continues to mount.

Sidney Crosby‚Äôs skill and adaptability keep him at the top



Legacy and longevity define Sidney Crosby‚Äôs career



Sidney Crosby has defied the odds once again. At 38, the Penguins captain remains one of the most productive players in the National Hockey League. Over two decades in the league, Crosby has consistently delivered on the ice, most recently scoring 33 goals and 91 points last season across 80 games. While many players slow down in their mid-30s, Crosby shows no signs of fading, demonstrating why he is regarded as one of the greatest hockey players of all time.What sets Crosby apart is more than talent‚Äîit‚Äôs his ability to adapt. Early in a player‚Äôs career, speed or physicality often dominates their style, but those qualities can decline with age. Crosby, however, has evolved. As The Hockey Writers highlight, his remarkable hockey IQ, vision, and puck skills allow him to adjust to his team‚Äôs needs and exploit opponents‚Äô weaknesses. Even if he‚Äôs not as fast or physical as he once was, his mental game, strategic awareness, and leadership make him one of the league‚Äôs most formidable players.Crosby‚Äôs leadership is legendary. Entering the 2025/26 season, he will tie Steve Yzerman as the longest-tenured captain in NHL history with 19 years at the helm of the Penguins. His guidance is crucial during a period of transition for the team, as the franchise navigates roster changes, developmental coaching adjustments, and ownership speculation.Through it all, Crosby‚Äôs presence remains a stabilizing force.Crosby is entering his third decade in the NHL still performing at elite levels. Remarkably, he has averaged a point per game in every one of his 20 seasons‚Äîa feat even Wayne Gretzky never achieved. With Evgeni Malkin approaching his likely final season and other key veterans facing uncertain futures, Crosby‚Äôs consistency stands out even more. The Penguins may lean on nostalgia this season, celebrating the final chapter of the ‚ÄúBig Three‚Äù era. Yet Crosby‚Äôs impact is more than memories; it‚Äôs his relentless effort, adaptability, and leadership that continue to shape the team‚Äôs present and future.Sidney Crosby isn‚Äôt just surviving the test of time‚Äîhe‚Äôs redefining what it means to age gracefully in professional hockey.Also Read: What Kirill Kaprizov‚Äôs massive deal means for Connor McDavid and the Edmonton Oilers‚Äô next big decision","Sidney Crosby is entering his third decade in the NHL still performing at elite levels.

Frankie Edgar pulled from BKFC 82 after medical concerns



Concerns about Frankie Edgar‚Äôs return from retirement



Frankie Edgar‚Äôs long-awaited return to combat sports will not take place this weekend in Newark. The 43-year-old UFC Hall of Famer was set to make his bare-knuckle debut at BKFC 82 against Jimmie Rivera at the Prudential Center, but was suddenly pulled from the lineup just days before the fight. The decision, confirmed by Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship, leaves fans stunned and raises fresh questions about Edgar‚Äôs fighting future.Multiple sources familiar with the event revealed that Frankie Edgar was not cleared to compete, forcing BKFC to replace him with Timmy Mason. Rivera, who had been preparing for the high-profile matchup, will still appear on the historic card ‚Äî the first state-sanctioned bare-knuckle event in New Jersey.BKFC president David Feldman addressed the decision on Wednesday: ‚ÄúAfter further review with our chief medical officer, we decided that Frankie Edgar was not going to compete this Saturday. We're going to look into it, and see what his future looks like, but he will not be competing this Saturday.‚ÄùThe news comes after Edgar underwent an extensive series of medical tests, including an echocardiogram, stress test, bloodwork, and MRI, in order to receive clearance from the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board.Although he had been training heavily in recent months, including sparring sessions and conditioning drills, concerns ultimately outweighed the momentum for his return.Conor McGregor, who co-owns BKFC, also weighed in during a media call. ‚ÄúI'm very upset for Frankie. I'm sure he's devastated, and you know, health is paramount here. We will address it, and we will re-evaluate it, and see where we go. Hopefully, we get Frankie in here at another date, but safety is paramount, and we take that with great care at Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship.‚ÄùEdgar retired from the UFC in November 2022 after a career that spanned more than 15 years, marked by legendary fights and a lightweight championship reign. However, his final years in the octagon were tough ‚Äî he suffered three consecutive knockouts to close his career, leaving his family and supporters concerned about lingering health effects.Despite the risks, Edgar had spoken openly about why he chose to compete again, saying, ‚ÄúMy wife was a little concerned with me doing this as well. I‚Äôve been doing this for so long, it‚Äôs tough to walk away. I‚Äôm not going into this na√Øve. I understand the risks. I‚Äôm willing to take that chance, I guess you could say. The juice has got to be worth the squeeze and I feel like it is‚Äù (MMA Fighting).For now, his BKFC debut is on hold, with no official word on whether he will fight again.Also Read: Did Heather McMahan go too far?

LeBron James faces harsh media backlash after skipping L.A. Lakers game for playful Kai Cenat livestream cameo

LeBron James‚Äô future in doubt as Lakers reject extension, fueling speculation of farewell tour and retirement

With a LeBron James haircut, Twitch streamer Kai Cenat celebrated reaching one million active followers, making Twitch history. On September 30, the NBA champion made a spectacular cameo at the end of his legendary streaming event, Mafiathon 3. There was also Tylil James. James was supposedly expected to attend the Los Angeles Lakers' preseason game. It was said that he is ill. However, he joined the stream instead. Therefore this drew criticism. In light of the recent event, one journalist declared that he was reportedly the greatest liar in history.On the same day that he appeared on a livestream with well-known content creator Kai Cenat , LeBron James was supposed to play in the preseason game. Fans and the media later strongly denounced this, casting doubt on his dedication. One journalist shared a video of the forward dancing with the streamer and said:""He's the biggest liar in history.‚ÄùThe incident happened as the marathon feed was coming to an end during Cenat's live broadcast of the Mafiathon 3. LeBron wasn't by himself. His daughter Zhuri and several of his friends were with him.In a social media video, Tylil unexpectedly emerged after spotting his hero while Cenat was seated close to James. A touching moment was created as LeBron got up from his chair and welcomed him.Tylil also gave Zhuri a hug. Even so, the Lakers star chose to poke fun that made everyone chuckle.‚ÄúThat's your long lost 3rd brother right there.‚ÄùLater, in another video posted online, LeBron echoed the lighthearted mood of the ceremony by cracking another joke and saying:‚ÄúTylil James, he is my firstborn.‚ÄùThe retirement of the NBA legend LeBron James is currently the talk of the market. This past summer, the Los Angeles Lakers reportedly turned down the offer to re-sign LeBron James. According to Yaron Weitzman of Bleacher Report, LeBron James tried to sign an extension during the offseason, but his team did not support his proposal.However, things did not go as planned earlier this year. This resulted in James having to exercise his $52.6 million player option. According to one NBA source:‚ÄúHe obviously wanted an extension, and it's also clear that the Lakers wouldn't give it to him.‚ÄùIn a press conference, Lakers officials discussed LeBron's retirement and the future with the team. No specific date was given, but the words indicated that LeBron is contemplating the next chapter of his life outside of basketball Yaron Weitzman also spoke with a number of league executives who are close to James. They talked about James's expectations of a farewell tour like Kobe Bryant, the value of stories, and his wish to avoid a quiet retirement like Michael Jordan's with the Wizards.Also read: Is LeBron James retiring?

Auston Matthews gets slammed by former NHL player Sean Avery

The Toronto Maple Leafs‚Äô captain and one of the most popular players in the league, Auston Matthews, had a rough season last time as he was dealing with his injuries. The Leafs‚Äô captain ended up appearing in only 67 games last season and the team recorded a pretty poor performance on the ice.

He was back here early in the summer. It is amazing; when he shows up, it seems like everyone else is here now, too. He was here probably a month before we got going, and with the preparation he puts toward his craft and the way he practices, he sets the standard.‚ÄùAuston Matthews spent the whole of last season trying to recover from his injuries and could only participate in 67 games total. This had sparked concern among fans as many criticised his focus and performance on the ice.While Auston Matthews looks pretty fit in the new season, the recent losses in the preseason has sparked some concern and panic among the Leafs' fans.Also Read: ""He's in a position of power"": Chris Pronger and Luke Gazdic react to Connor McDavid‚Äôs uncertain future with the Edmonton Oilers",Former NHL player Sean Avery slammed Auston Matthews on the Spittin‚Äô Chicklets podcast.

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has reportedly suspended all No Objection Certificates (NOCs) for players planning to participate in foreign T20 leagues following the national team‚Äôs defeat to India in the Asia Cup 2025 final.Pakistan suffered a five-wicket loss to India on Sunday at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, as the Suryakumar Yadav-led side secured India‚Äôs ninth Asia Cup title.On September 29, Sumair Ahmad Syed, the PCB‚Äôs Chief Operating Officer, issued a notice to players and agents regarding the suspension of NOCs.This decision directly impacts key players such as Babar Azam, Shaheen Afridi, Faheem Ashraf, and Mohammad Rizwan, who are among seven Pakistani cricketers scheduled to play in Australia‚Äôs Big Bash League (BBL).In addition, 16 Pakistani players, including Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub, and Fakhar Zaman, are registered for the International League T20 (ILT20) auction, set to begin on October 1 in the UAE.The board has indicated that the move is intended to encourage players to focus on domestic tournaments, particularly the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, Pakistan‚Äôs premier first-class competition, which is set to start in October. However, there is no clarity on when the current NOC suspension might be lifted or how long the evaluation process will take.Pakistan endured three consecutive defeats against India in the Asia Cup, including a seven-wicket loss in the group stage, a six-wicket defeat in the Super Fours, and the five-wicket loss in the final.The post-final presentation ceremony descended into chaos when Indian players refused to accept the winner‚Äôs trophy from Mohsin Naqvi, who also serves as chairman of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC).As Naqvi waited on one side of the stage, the Indian team remained about 15 yards away, refusing to move. The delay continued for several minutes, and when Naqvi finally stepped onto the stage, Indian fans booed loudly, chanting ‚ÄúBharat Mata Ki Jai.‚Äù Officials then informed Naqvi that the Indian players would not accept the trophy from him.With the trophy unclaimed, the presentation concluded without the formal handover.

Giants locker room drama: Russell Wilson looks ‚Äòdisgusted‚Äô during Dart‚Äôs postgame hype speech



Not all fans are convinced that this is the ‚Äúlook of hatred‚Äù



Giants fans, the drama is real. A video from Sunday‚Äôs locker room has gone viral, showing Russell Wilson giving rookie QB Jaxson Dart a look that can only be described as ‚Äúdisgusted.‚Äù Dart, fresh off leading the Giants to a 21‚Äì18 upset over the previously undefeated Chargers, was delivering a pumped-up postgame speech when Wilson‚Äôs unimpressed glare stole the show. The clip quickly spread across X (formerly Twitter), and fans can‚Äôt stop talking about what that side-eye really meant.Context is everything here. Wilson, who started the season as the Giants‚Äô quarterback, was benched after an 0‚Äì3 start, paving the way for Dart to take over the offense.Sunday‚Äôs win marked Dart‚Äôs first major statement as the team‚Äôs starter, and his locker room speech was full of energy, motivation, and hype for the team.Meanwhile, Wilson was caught looking, well, less than thrilled. Whether it was frustration, disbelief, or just a classic ‚Äúbenchwarmer mood,‚Äù his expression instantly became a meme-worthy moment for fans.As soon as the video hit social media, fans went wild. The clip sparked heated debates about team dynamics, the QB room vibe, and whether Wilson‚Äôs reaction hinted at tension behind the scenes or if he was simply a stoic competitor.Before fans spiral into full conspiracy mode, it‚Äôs important to note that Wilson has publicly expressed support for Dart and emphasized his commitment to the Giants. Still, a picture or in this case, a side-eye video can speak louder than words. The moment has added a new layer of intrigue to the Giants‚Äô quarterback saga, keeping fans glued to social media as they analyze every subtle expression and gesture from the locker room.Locker room dynamics aside, the Giants now have an energized rookie leading the offense while a veteran quarterback watches from the sidelines. Wilson‚Äôs viral glare reminds everyone that competition breeds tension, but it also pushes the team to improve. Whether his expression was innocent, iconic, or somewhere in between, one thing is clear, fans will be watching, laughing, and debating every step of the way, especially as Dart continues to prove he belongs under center.Also read - Malik Nabers‚Äô knee injury looks worse than it is‚Äîhere‚Äôs why Giants fans can chill","Russell Wilson gave rookie QB Jaxson Dart a look that can only be described as ‚Äúdisgusted.‚Äù Dart was delivering a pumped-up postgame speech when Wilson‚Äôs unimpressed glare stole the show.

Erik Johnson‚Äôs retirement confirmed by Colorado Avalanche

Erik Johnson‚Äôs legacy and lasting impact on hockey

Erik Johnson Equalizes For the Avalanche With Blue Line Snipe

The NHL may have had its own surprises during each season, yet sometimes the offseason brings the most emotional moments. Now, the fans, analysts, and even some former players are thinking about Erik Johnson: a name that used to be synonymous with steady defense, leadership, and championship mettle. The Avalanche faithful know just how much Johnson has been a central figure in their identity. In a way, his retirement marks the end of an era and the celebration of a life defined by resilience and loyalty.Wednesday afternoon saw the official announcement via social media from the Colorado Avalanche that Erik Johnson had decided to retire from professional hockey. The 17-year veteran spent 14 years in Colorado, playing in 1,023 games and recording 348 points derived from 95 goals and 253 assists. The trusted blue-liner also logged 1,717 blocked shots and 1,695 hits, leaving a physical imprint on the game.In a way, the 2021‚Äì22 season marked the climax of his career, winning the Stanley Cup for the Avalanche. Johnson probably felt 18 years in the NHL was enough, and, with immense gratitude in his farewell message, he announced his retirement. A word of thanks to the Avalanche, his former teams, his teammates, coaches, and fans, but most of all to his family that has stood by him through it all.He stated that hockey was his life, and now he looked toward the future with lots of excitement but also with a heart full of fond memories given by the sport to him.The Blues drafted Johnson in 2006 first overall, making him one of only two American-born defensemen ever to receive that honor. Apart from his draft-day history, Johnson became one of only six defensemen chosen first overall to actually skate in 1,000 NHL games. Other than with the Blues, Sabres, and Flyers, Colorado remained his true hockey home.There were alleged PTO opportunities, but Johnson was adamant about doing it on his terms, walking away with dignity. Unbeaten for his consistency and leadership, he stands eighth in games played on the Avalanche's all-time leaderboard. To fans, he was more than just a player; he was a defining element of the franchise for two decades.With the retirement of Erik Johnson, a chapter of grit, loyalty, sacrifice, and championship memories closes. While life will go on in the NHL, his presence in Colorado and all across the league will stand as an inspiration to young defensemen who are vying to live the same dream.Also Read: New Jersey Devils lock down defenseman Luke Hughes with 7-year $63 million deal","Erik Johnson announced his retirement from professional hockey on Wednesday.

Brock Purdy‚Äôs impact on the 49ers‚Äô offense



The San Francisco 49ers are preparing to face the Los Angeles Rams in a crucial Thursday Night Football matchup.

Backup Mac Jones is expected to start under center, making this his first start with the team in a live game situation.Purdy‚Äôs absence shifts the responsibility to Mac Jones, who will have to manage the offense and maintain the rhythm established by the 49ers‚Äô starting lineup.

Mac Jones will now have to manage the game, and the receiving corps will have to adjust with Jennings and Pearsall out. Rookie receivers or secondary targets may see more snaps, and the team will likely rely more heavily on the running game to balance the offense.49ers fans will be watching closely to see how Jones performs and whether the team can maintain momentum without their starting QB.

wins 25m pistol silver medal

A lot has been said about the strength of the Indian shooting team. While the teams are getting younger, the bench is getting deeper. But it isn‚Äôt the shooters alone. It won‚Äôt be an exaggeration to say that if hypothetically there are no shooters available to participate, India can field its coaches for probably its B or C teams.The Indian coaching team has grown stronger over the last five months with many ‚Äòrecently retired‚Äô shooters donning the coaching hat.Among the new joiners are Olympian and multiple World Cup champion Jitu Rai , Asian Games medallist Sonia Rai, Commonwealth Games silver winner Pemba Tamang (pistol); former Asian and Commonwealth Games champion Pooja Ghatkar and Commonwealth Games participant Hariom Singh (rifle).Veterans like Samaresh Jung, Jaspal Rana and Sanjeev Rajput have been into coaching for almost a decade now. ‚ÄúI think it is good to see so many fresh coaches like Jitu and Pooja transitioning well into the new role. They are bringing in fresh ideas, and it is going to help the young shooters in the coming years,‚Äù India‚Äôs high performance director Pierre Beauchamp told TOI .Jitu, one of the best pistol shooters India has seen, said he still finds himself more as a shooter than a coach. ‚ÄúWhen I go as a coach with the shooters to tournaments, I prefer to tell them more about the match pressure and things that normally shooters face during the matches.Those are things only a shooter can feel but they may not have the answers. I feel it is not just the technical bit, my job is also to tell them about mind issues,‚Äù Jitu said.‚ÄúI tell them about the scenarios that they can expect during the matches so that when they face that situation, they have the answers. The joy of knowing the problems before they face it, makes the situation better for them,‚Äù the World Championship silver medallist added.
