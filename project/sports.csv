Diontae Johnson is moving into the playoffs with his new team

Versatile wide receiver Diontae Johnson said he is focused on the Texans now, and not on past experiences with his recent league bounce. Johnson was traded to the Panthers and then acquired by the Ravens in an October trade. He played four games for the Ravens before his suspension. He was waived in Week 16 and signed by the Texans to address a thin wide receiving corps after Tank Dell's knee injury. On Monday, Johnson said he wants to focus on playing Tennessee this week and then getting into the playoffs with his new team.Diontae Johnson is leaving the Baltimore Ravens and is eagerly anticipating a fresh start with the Houston Texans . ""I'm going to leave that in the past. Fresh start here,"" Johnson told reporters on Monday. ""I had a good time there. I got some good teammates over there. Those relationships are still going to be there. I'm trying to win games and go far in the playoff.”Johnson signed with the Texans following a one-game suspension from the Ravens for refusing to play against the Philadelphia Eagles. He was excused from all team activities by the Ravens, who later released him on December 20. The Ravens traded for Johnson on October 29. During the offseason, he was traded from the Pittsburgh Steelers to the Panthers. After being traded to Baltimore, Johnson has had 30 catches for 257 yards and three touchdowns for Carolina, with only one catch for 6 yards for the Ravens.The Texans acquired Johnson with limited receiver options, including star wideout Nico Collins and Stefon Diggs, who tore their ACL earlier this season. Other options - aside from John Metchie III, Robert Woods, Jared Wayne, and Xavier Hutchinson - were inactive. Coach DeMeco Ryans is giving Johnson a ""clean slate.”""With Diontae, adding him to our team, he's a guy who has talent. He's done it at a high level,"" Ryans said. ""He's bounced around a little bit here. It really doesn't matter what's happened in the past, or what the narrative is about. You come here and everything is a fresh start. So we'll see how he can help us, what he can add to our team on the field and off the field.”Johnson has already embraced the culture that Ryans has cultivated. ""Team first,"" Johnson said. ""Everybody is about the team, I'm about the team too. So I'm doing whatever the coach is asking me to do.” The addition of Johnson to Houston would be a great boost for the offense that has averaged only 21.8 points per game this season and has scored 30 or more points only twice this year. The Texans are currently coming off a two-point performance on Christmas Day.Also Read: Despite the Bengals win, Jason Kelce blasted the team's head coach Zac Taylor’s clock management against the Broncos The Texans need to improve their offense in the playoffs, and Johnson, despite not being Diggs or Dell, is a significant upgrade over Metchie and Woods.

Bill Belichick proposes a straightforward solution to address tanking in the NFL

The Pat McAfee Show Live | Monday December 30th 2024

Former NFL champion Bill Belichick recently called for the introduction of an NBA-style draft lottery in the NFL, as teams increasingly shift from college football to the NFL and stop playing to lose. This could be just what the NFL needs-a lottery system-to counter the trend of tanking by teams, according to Belichick. This system would break the correlation between a team's record and their chance of getting the No. 1 draft pick, especially in years with a rising college quarterback prospect.The New York Giants, in a very big way, have taken themselves as the number one draft choice after defeating the Indianapolis Colts in the last week of the NFL season, moving down from being the overall No. 1. This has led to a very big shift in the draft order. But Bill Belichick doesn't like to discuss this issue.The North Carolina head coach, he went on the Pat McAfee Show to discuss how the Giants' win over the Indianapolis Colts meant that New England Patriots would now get the top overall pick, and Belichick said removing the allure of tanking might help make the league competitive, he even recommended copying from the NBA.""I was never involved in [tanking] but I don’t know what happens somewhere else,"" Belichick said, per Awful Announcing. ""It’s different than the NBA. The NBA kind of rectified that by having a lottery. So even if you’re the worst team, you’re not guaranteed the first pick. In the NFL, that’s not quite the case. If you are the worst team, you do get the first pick.”He further added, ""Personally, I don’t think it would be a bad idea for the competitiveness of the sport to do something similar to what basketball does with those lottery picks. Then we wouldn’t be having this conversation — well we might be having it, but there’d be other circumstances besides just your record. There’d be actually a lottery part of it.”The New York Giants are now on the way after their recent 45-33 victory over the Indianapolis Colts, which will shape the 2025 NFL Draft. Former Patriots quarterback Bill Belichick's New England Patriots are ready and set to take away the No. 1 draft pick in Week 18, according to NBC Sports' Justin Leger.Belichick's lottery proposal disincentivizes tanking and avoids rewarding poor franchises, potentially inspiring positive change within these organizations and adding intrigue to the draft cycle, which the NFL is always interested in.Also Read: “Worst coaching performance”: Falcons head coach Raheem Morris gets ripped apart by fans after timeout blunder against the Commanders Tanking is less extreme in football and only used to strategically sit out a player with an extremely high draft pick but no football team ever actively loses month-long stretches as the NBA teams have over the years. The punishment is too extreme and the careers are too short so everyone can't be ready to tank games on purpose, with a 53-man roster and coaching staff being too small to really commit to this kind of behavior.","Bill Belichick calls for NBA-style draft lottery to counter trend of tanking in the NFL.

Rohit Sharma: 'Virat Kohli is a modern day great. He will figure it out'

Rohit Sharma hit on knee during nets session at MCG

Melbourne: The number of runs Rohit Sharma has scored in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) so far is one more than the number of wickets (30) Jasprit Bumrah has picked since landing in Australia last month. Three Tests, five innings, 31 runs. That's all Rohit has managed in the ongoing series, and barely has he managed to take his runs tally ahead of Bumrah's 30 wickets.While the statistic is good for the laughs and social media memes, on a serious note it is a sorry reflection of Rohit the batter. Not that he has come across as a tactically sound and proactive Test captain, but the extended lean patch has clearly and further deteriorated his decision-making.Rain saved India in Brisbane but proper five days of Test cricket at the MCG has served another stern reminder of why the Indian captain's time is up in the whites. While there are murmurs of conversations with BCCI top brass and selectors over retirement, it's understood that Rohit has already made up his mind.When and where the announcement happens is anybody's guess but it's highly unlikely that the Indian captain will continue after the BGT. Rohit would undoubtedly like to convince selectors to allow him to stay for the World Test Championship (WTC) final, should India pull off a miracle and make it there. However, if they don't, Sydney is destined to be Rohit's last dance.That bit is absolutely clear and selectors are already in the know of what's approaching. However, the bigger question at this stage is not about retirement but whether Rohit deserves to be in the Playing XI at all?The runs aren't coming. Even after a decent series vs England at home, the Test average in 2024 has been in the mid 20s and he has only scored two centuries and two half-centuries in the 14 Tests he has played.619 runs in 14 Tests would have pushed any batter out of the setup but Rohit, because of captaincy and reputation, has managed to hang on longer than he should have.Apart from the lack of runs, the experiments in Melbourne -- Rohit at top, KL Rahul at No. 3 and Shubman Gill on the bench -- did more harm than good and it's just delaying the transition and opportunities to the next generation of superstars.If you play Rohit in Sydney, the same batting order is likely to continue and it would mean Shubman Gill returns home after playing just three innings -- two of which had fluent starts. And KL Rahul continues to do something which he hasn't done often in his career -- bat at No.3.Australia have seen numerous Test retirements in the past but for India, more important than the retirement is the smooth transition. Many moons ago, MS Dhoni, a visionary leader, did just that when he retired midway through the series and handed over the reins to Virat Kohli.Will Rohit follow suit or wait for the ""why nots"" to get louder?",Rohit Sharma has scored 31 runs in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) so far. That's one more than the number of wickets (30) Jasprit Bumrah has picked since landing in Australia last month.

Rohit Sharma press conference: On his batting, captaincy, future, Rishabh Pant’s shot and more

NEW DELHI: As India lost the Boxing Day Test against Australia by 184 runs at the at Melbourne Cricket Ground on Monday, one of the turning points of the match was the dismissal of Rishabh Pant by Travis Head . Mitchell Marsh took a fine catch wide of long-on to dismiss Pant off Head but what followed after that was a unique but absurd celebration by the Aussie all-rounder.That celebration ruffled quite a few Indian feathers but during the post-match press conference, Australia captain Pat Cummins explained the reason behind it when asked by a reporter to clear up what the celebration was about.Cummins said, ""It's his fingers so hot, he's got to put it in a cup of ice. Yeah that's what it is. So that's normally the running joke. But it was at the Gabba or somewhere he got a wicket as well. And just goes straight to the fridge, grabs a bucket of ice, puts his finger in and just walks in front of Lyno (Nathan Lyon). Just like that. Think it's very funny. So that's what it would have been, nothing else.""But former Indian cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu slammed Head's behaviour calling it an insult to 1.5 billion Indians.Sidhu posted on X: ""Travis head's obnoxious behaviour during the course of the Melbourne test doesn't auger well for for the gentleman's game…… sets the worst possible example when there are kids, women , young & old watching the game……. this caustic conduct did not insult an individual but a nation of 1.5 billion Indians……stringent punishment that would serve a deterrent for the future generations needs to be slapped on him so that no one dares follow suit !!!""India now need to win the last Test of the series, in Sydney, to draw level and retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .","India lost the Boxing Day Test against Australia by 184 runs at the at Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Taylor Swift Did Not Sell The Maximum Tickets In Australia



Travis Kelce And Taylor Swift Are Currently Relaxing In New York City



The NFL star and the quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs, Travis Kelce is currently dating the most popular global pop star, Taylor Swift . While Taylor’s legendary Eras Tour generated a revenue of $2.2 billion, it turns out another artist in Australia sold more tickets (across Australia) than Taylor. This is none other than the popular pop star, Pink who is also known by her real name Alicia Moore.However, things were not easy for Pink when global pop star Taylor was performing in Australia. Even though Pink sold many more tickets than Taylor, Australian media was busy promoting and talking about Beyonce and Taylor’s tour rather than hers. As per Sam Fischer's interview on Nova’s Ricki-Lee, Tim & Joel, he said, “I have a friend who's Pink's background singer and my friend Danny said she's really just pi**ed off no one's talking about the fact that she's also selling out stadiums.”Pink sold out stadiums and yet no media promoted it that much. Pink had expressed gratitude to her audience and as per Daily Mail, Pink has also spoken about how she has the record for the maximum number of ticket sales held by a female artist who has performed in Australia.Pink has been performing in Australia for the last twenty years of her life and Michael Coppel of the Live Nation Australasia spoke to the Herald Sun about this. He said, “There is a palpable mutual love affair between the Australasian audience that love seeing her perform live, and an artist who clearly loves being here. Congratulations, Alecia, on yet another stunning record-breaking tour.”While it is unfortunate that Pink did not get as much media attention as Taylor did but Taylor herself has broken several records through the Eras Tour. With a revenue of $2.2 billion, her tour became the second most attended concert in the world, just a close second to Coldplay’s “Music of the Sphere.”In Australia itself, Travis’ girlfriend Taylor managed to sell 600,000 tickets. Taylor travelled the world for it and visited each continent for her Eras tour. Finally, Taylor managed to wrap up her Eras tour on 8th December after her final performance in Canada.Currently, Taylor has not announced any new project of hers and is enjoying her break in New York City with her boyfriend, Travis Kelce. Taylor has been spotted going out and about in the Big Apple, hand in hand with her boyfriend. She has recently been spotted on a date night and while celebrating her best friend’s birthday and fans cannot get enough of the two.While Travis is yet to enter the playoffs with his team next month, there has been no official statement from Taylor about her next project.Also Read: Buffalo Bills' Josh Allen’s fiancée Hailee Steinfeld becomes a part of the Bills’ family through a special gift","Pink sold out stadiums and yet no media promoted it that much.

NEW DELHI: The clamour of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli exiting Test cricket grew after the veteran batters endured another failure, resulting in India's crushing 184-run loss in the Boxing Day Test against Australia at the MCG on Monday.However, former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar voiced his support for Kohli, stating that the former Indian captain deserves a longer run in Test cricket. He also emphasised that comparisons between Rohit and Kohli are unwarranted.""I must say there is no comparison between Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli as Test batters. Virat Kohli is right up there. He's a great Test batter, and Rohit Sharma is a good Test batter. Rohit's white-ball batting great,"" Manjrekar said on Star Sports.""So Virat Kohli obviously deserves a longer rope. It's not so much about Virat Kohli. I want to know what the batting coach of India is doing. We can't solve the obvious problem of such a fine player. Enough has been said about Virat Kohli, we just have to leave him alone,"" he added.Manjrekar also remarked that Rohit old has the ability to make decisions in the best interest of Indian cricket, noting that he seems to be in the ""doldrums'.""It's not really up to Rohit Sharma. If you look at how the protocol and the hierarchy of team selection is, the chairman of selectors, he has the decision to make. He has the power to do what's best for Indian cricket, so it's not so much about Rohit Sharma himself, you know, deciding what should be the future,"" said Manjrekar.""The chairman of the selector has that power. That's with Rohit and he does look down in the doldrums. Virat Kohli is a different issue altogether,"" he added.Chasing a daunting target of 340, Rohit Sharma (9 off 40 balls) and Virat Kohli (5) struggled to overcome their technical flaws and mental hurdles, as India collapsed spectacularly, losing seven wickets for 34 runs in just 20.4 overs during the final session, eventually being bowled out for 155 in 79.1 overs.Australia took a 2-1 advantage ahead of the fifth and final Test which is scheduled to start on January 3 at the Sydney Cricket Ground.","Former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar says Virat Kohli deserves a longer run in Test cricket.

India lost seven wickets in the final session of the fourth Test against Australia on Monday to concede lead in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. The 184-run win gave the hosts a 2-1 lead in the series with one contest, in Sydney, to go.The win took Australia to second place in the World Test Championship (WTC) Standings, on 61.46 percentage points. India, meanwhile, remain third on 52.78 points. South Africa, who beat Pakistan on Sunday in a thriller of their own, are top of the pile with 66.67 points and have assured themselves of a maiden WTC Final appearance at Lord's in June.With the defeat, India hold a very small chance to make the WTC Final. Even if Rohit Sharma-led side win the fifth and final Test in Sydney, they would only reach 55.26 percentage points which would be lesser than Australia's 57.84 for the loss.The only way India can overhaul Australia now is if Sri Lanka do them a favour in the two-match series.On the other hand, if Australia go on to win in Sydney, and clinch the Border-Gavaskar Trophy by 3-1 margin, they would go up to 63.73 percentage points. India, meanwhile, would remain third on 50.00 points, a sharp fall from being in a positive place after the series win against Bangladesh.Ever since, India's chances of playing the WTC Final have taken one hit after another. It all began with the 3-0 series loss at home against New Zealand. In Australia, India got off to a positive start, winning the opener in Perth by a massive 295 runs.But Australia clinched the second Test, at the Adelaide Oval, by 10-wickets, to keep themselves in the thick of things as far as WTC Points Table is concerned.A draw at the Gabba in Brisbane didn't help either side. Instead, it made the MCG Test even more important than the context of the series and bragging rights that go with it.Finally, India's hapless collapse in the final session allowed Australia to all but book their place in the title showdown with India on the verge of missing out.","India lost seven wickets in the final session of the fourth Test against Australia on Monday to concede lead in Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Theis listed as “questionable” on the team’s injury report.Joel Embiid and the Philadelphia 76ers head to Portland on Monday night, looking to maintain their perfect record on their current six-game road trip. The team's recent performance has been excellent. They won 9 of their last 12 games and this has significantly boosted their Eastern Conference playoff positioning.The Sixers face the Trail Blazers at Moda Center with several key players' availability in question. Joel Embiid , who is nursing both a left foot sprain and a sinus fracture requiring a protective mask, remains questionable for Monday's matchup. The injuries occurred during warmups before the Christmas Day clash against the Boston Celtics.Despite his questionable status, Embiid managed to show off his skills in Saturday's victory over the Utah Jazz , contributing 27 points to the team's success. If cleared for Monday's game, it would mark his longest streak of consecutive appearances this season.Since returning from a seven-game absence on December 8, Embiid has showcased remarkable consistency. In the six games he's played over the last eight, he's averaged 24 points, 6 rebounds, and 4 assists, while maintaining impressive shooting percentages - 47% from the field and 38% from beyond the arc. He has also been effective on defence, averaging one steal and one block per game.The injury report extends beyond Embiid, with Andre Drummond (left toe contusion) and Eric Gordon (oral surgery recovery) listed as questionable. The team will be without Jared McCain, who is recuperating from left knee meniscus surgery, and KJ Martin, sidelined with a left foot stress reaction.The 10 p.m. ET game at Portland's Moda Center will be another important test for the surging Sixers. Their recent performance suggests a team finding its rhythm, particularly on the road, where they've shown remarkable resilience despite various injury challenges.For fans following the team's progress, tonight’s game will be another indicator of the Sixers' championship aspirations, particularly if Embiid continues his strong return to form. His presence on the court, even while managing injuries, has been instrumental in the team's recent success.Also read: Will LaMelo Ball play against the Chicago Bulls tonight?

Ryan Rex Wants To Come Back To The New York Jets As A Head Coach



The New York Jets Is Currently Busy Conducting Interviews



The last few years have been a bit troublesome for the former head coach of the New York Jets Rex Ryan. After being with the New York Jets for several years, Rex was fired eight years ago, in 2016 after the New York Jets lost to the Miami Dolphins which eliminated the New York Jets from competing for the playoffs. Eight years later, Rex has revealed to Islander Rick DiPietro and Dave Rothenberg on ESPN that he intends to join the New York Jets as a head coach again.The New York Jets had a disastrous run on the field this season and their former head coach, Rex did not hold back from sharing his opinion regarding what needs to be fixed in the team. Rex spoke about the lack of discipline in the New York Jets and a lack of leadership mentality. He added, “The lack of discipline is brutal, there's just no question bout it.

Rex commented on this and spoke about how he thinks the hiring will be conducted in the future. He said, “Look, they're not gonna bring anybody in I'm sure until after the season's done and then this is the way Woody has always operated and we'll see what happens once the season's over”As per a report by ESPN, the New York Jets started conducting interviews last week and have already finished interviews for three candidates. This includes the former general manager of the Tennessee Titans Jon Robinson, the former general manager of the Atlanta Falcons Thomas Dimitrogg and Jim Nagy. But it looks like the New York Jets are also interested in a fourth candidate, as per ESPN’s Adam Schefter - ESPN analyst Louis Riddick is also expected to sit for an interview for the position of the New York Jets’ general manager.Back in 2016 after Rex was fired, he was immediately replaced by Sean McDermott who had a much better season with the New York Jets than Rex.

India batters throw in the towel to give Australia 2-1 lead after a heart-warming fightback by bowlers on Day 4

MELBOURNE: Bad judgment can break a team, as India found out the hard way here at the 'G' on Monday. Just after tea on the decisive fifth day, Rohit Sharma 's men appeared to be well on their way to saving a pulsating Test match in which they had always been behind the curve but had also, till now, clawed back at crucial junctures.At 112/3 when the final session began, and with Rishabh Pant and Yashasvi Jaiswal having done all the hard work to keep Pat Cummins , Mitchell Starc and Scott Boland at bay for long stretches with some resolute defence, Cummins threw the ball to innocuous part-time offspinner Travis Head.Over-rate concerns, it seems, were primarily on the Australian captain's mind, but perhaps there were hopes Head could induce a false shot from either batter.It was like taking candy from a kid. Pant, who had been panned for throwing his wicket away in the first innings by attempting facile scoops with fielders placed just for that shot, saw a half-tracker and had another brain fade. He could have hit it anywhere. The game was in the balance and India were hanging on by the skin of their teeth since being reduced to 33/3 in pursuit of an improbable 340, following another all-too-familiar top-order collapse.Pant and Jaiswal had added 88 precious runs in a wicketless middle session for Australia. Instead, the maverick wicketkeeper went for the glory shot, managing only to hole out to Mitchell Marsh at wide long on. ""Six is a drug, but it only fetches two runs more than a four,"" a frustrated Sunil Gavaskar declared on air. Australia had a foot in the door, and their formidable bowling lineup did the rest.Soon after, Boland got some extra bounce and with it, Ravindra Jadeja 's wicket. Five balls later, Nitish Reddy edged Lyon to slip. Cummins, Australia's man of the moment, got into the game next, bowling a short one down leg which Jaiswal, now on a hard-earned 84, chased needlessly.A controversial DRS confirmed there was a deflection from either the bat sticker or the glove, and suddenly, all hope was gone. India were staring at an early defeat, and spectators started pouring out of the MCG in their thousands after another day of record attendance.True to form, the tail didn't last too much longer, and as the Aussies celebrated an extraordinary 184-run win - which gives them a 2-1 lead in the series going into the Sydney Test - Indian cricket's bleak present came into sharp focus.This defeat should mark a point of no return for the team, especially given the predictable manner of dismissals. Rohit, who opened again, showed glimpses of form before falling to Cummins for the sixth time at the first instance of attempting an aggressive stroke. That over was a double-wicket maiden, with Man of the Match Cummins accounting for KL Rahul - needlessly demoted to No. 3 - with a beauty. The last over before lunch, Virat Kohli did Virat Kohli things, going fishing again and falling for Starc's bait outside off.India's senior batters now seem in danger of being termed liabilities. A change of guard seems imminent. Only Jasprit Bumrah , wondrous, magical, rare, is carrying the flame for the experienced rung of players as the last stop looms in Sydney.And what of Pant, from whom wonderous things are always expected but seldom delivered? ""Rishabh obviously needs to understand what is required of himself,"" Rohit said, ""More than any of us telling him, it's about him understanding and figuring out what's the right way to go about it.""In the past, he has given us a lot of success doing what he does. Sometimes you want to back that thought of him playing the way he plays, sometimes when things don't look good, it frustrates everyone."" Rohit may well have been talking not just about Pant, but about himself and every other struggling batter in the team.As for the Test, India had their moments but couldn't seize them. Bumrah was overbowled but produced wickets almost every time he came on. Jaiswal's dropped catches in Australia's second innings came back to haunt. Nitish Kumar Reddy's maiden ton brought India back into the game but eventually, the batting superstars just couldn't raise their game when it mattered.This has been an epic Test, played on a rare pitch with something for everyone and producing enough drama and tension every day, right till the last ball, to keep the crowds coming.A new attendance record for a Test in Australia was set, with 373,691 people turning up.Unfortunately, just as Test cricket took flight here at the 'G', India found their wings clipped.",Australia beat India by 184 runs to take 2-1 lead in the series. India were reduced to 33/3 in pursuit of an improbable 340. Rishabh Pant and Yashasvi Jaiswal had added 88 precious runs in a wicketless middle session for Australia. Pant went for the glory shot and hole out to Mitchell Marsh.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116814882,imgsize-86008,width-400,resizemode-4/116814882.jpg"

South Africa secured their spot in the World Test Championship (WTC) final after a thrilling two-wicket victory against Pakistan in Centurion.This makes them the first team to qualify for the final, scheduled to be held at Lord's next June.Three teams—Australia, India, and Sri Lanka—are vying for the remaining spot. Each of these three teams will play four of the remaining six Tests in the WTC cycle.Australia 's 184-run triumph over India in the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) has significantly impacted the qualification scenario.Australia's victory at the MCG has boosted their chances of defending their WTC title at Lord's.A win in the upcoming Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) Test would guarantee their qualification, regardless of the results of the two-Test series between Australia and Sri Lanka.This is because a win at the SCG would elevate Australia's win percentage to 57, a figure unattainable by both India and Sri Lanka.If the SCG Test results in a draw, Australia would need at least one draw in their series against Sri Lanka to secure qualification.This is due to the possibility of Sri Lanka winning both their matches against Australia, which would bring their win percentage to 53.85, potentially surpassing Australia.Should India manage to win the SCG Test, Australia would need to win at least one Test against Sri Lanka to surpass India's potential win percentage of 55.26.India's position has declined from the top spot after their series against Bangladesh to the third spot with a win percentage of 52.78.This drop occurred despite India having one Test in hand.They now trail the top two contenders, both of whom have win percentages exceeding 60.The MCG defeat signifies the first instance in this WTC cycle where India's qualification fate is no longer solely in their hands.India's best-case scenario involves winning the SCG Test to achieve a win percentage of 55.26.They would then need Australia to not win any of their matches against Sri Lanka.If the series against Australia ends in a 2-2 draw and both Tests between Australia and Sri Lanka are also drawn, both India and Australia will have a win percentage of 55.26.In this scenario, India would qualify by virtue of winning more series (three compared to Australia's two).However, if Australia earns more than eight points in their series against Sri Lanka (two draws would give them eight points), they would finish ahead of India.A defeat or a draw in the final Test in Australia would eliminate India from contention for a third consecutive WTC final appearance.Sri Lanka's chances of reaching the WTC final suffered a significant setback after their series loss to South Africa.Any result other than a draw in the SCG Test would eliminate Sri Lanka from contention, regardless of the outcome of their series against Australia in February.Sri Lanka's only path to the top two involves winning both matches against Australia and the SCG Test ending in a draw.This scenario would result in Sri Lanka finishing with a win percentage of 53.85, Australia with 53.51, and India with 51.75.","Australia's 184-run triumph over India in the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) has significantly impacted the qualification scenario.

NEW DELHI: Indian captain Rohit Sharma 's clarification that Shubman Gill was not dropped for the Boxing Day Test against Australia did not sit well with legendary Sunil Gavaskar , who asserted that the decision could only be described as a drop.The decision to drop Gill and accommodate all-rounder Washington Sundar, aimed at strengthening the lower middle-order batting depth, drew criticism. However, Rohit clarified that the choice was not made solely by him.""Look, I had a chat with him. There's no way when you're leaving someone out, for whatever reason it is, you will have a chat. And the chat with him was clear that he was not dropped. We just wanted to have that extra bit of cushion in the bowling,"" Rohit said.""Hence, we opted for an all-rounder, which shouldn't weaken our batting line-up. Compromising a batter for a bowler was not something that I wanted to do.Gavaskar did mince his words when he was asked for his opinion during a discussion on Star Sports on Rohit's statement during the post-match press conference""How much bowling did you give to Washington Sundar? What cushion are you talking about? The requirement of the team is perfectly fine. You need to take decisions based on that, but you left him (Gill) out of the team, you can only call it dropped in whichever language you might speak,"" Gavaskar said.""You can say you omitted or dropped him, both are the same. Omit looks different, drop looks different, and left out looks different. I am talking about English but in the end, that guy was sitting in the dugout and was not on the ground,"" he added.Sundar bowled just 19 overs in the match, taking one wicket across two innings. With the bat, he contributed a responsible 50-run knock in India's first innings and remained unbeaten on five in the second.Chasing a target of 340 on the final day of the fourth Test, the Indian batters struggled once again, with only Yashasvi Jaiswal (84) standing out. The team fell short by 184 runs, resulting in a defeat and trailing 1-2 in the five-match series.",Shubman Gill was dropped by India for the fourth Test against Australia. Captain Rohit Sharma said the decision was not made solely by him. Sunil Gavaskar said that the decision could only be described as a drop. India lost the Test by 184 runs and are now 1-2 down in the series.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116803897,imgsize-53490,width-400,resizemode-4/116803897.jpg"

MELBOURNE: India have little time for reflection following Monday's avoidable defeat. The manner of their collapse in the last session is unlikely to leave the team in a happy space going into the Sydney Test in three days' time. That fifth Test is now a must-win game if India are to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy . For that to come to pass, some difficult decisions may need to be taken, starting with the captain.Should Rohit Sharma give himself another opportunity or should he drop himself - like England's Mike Denness did in Sydney during the 1974-75 Ashes series - following a prolonged lean patch? Along the way, should KL Rahul 's opening slot be restored?There's also the question of a potential recall for Shubman Gill , who Rohit insisted ""had not been dropped"". Then there's the form of Virat Kohli , who has looked good in patches but eventually tended to succumb in similar fashion, trying to drive deliveries on the fifth stump line.As for his own lack of runs, Rohit was candid, terming it ""disturbing"".""I stand where I'm standing today. A lot of the things I'm trying to do are not falling in place. Mentally, it is disturbing without a doubt. If you come here and try and do successfully what you're supposed to, and if those things don't fall in place, that is a big disappointment,"" he said, admitting, ""There are things we as a team need to look at, I personally need to look at as well. We'll try and see what happens. There's still a game to go. If we can play well, it'd be nice to make it 2-2.""India's team selection till now has largely been based on covering up for top-order failures in some tough batting conditions. It may be time to shed the negative baggage and stop packing the side with allrounders whose bowling arms are rarely used, increasing the workload on pace spearhead Bumrah ""Yes, Bumrah has bowled a lot of overs. If somebody is in such great form, you want to try and maximize that form. But there comes a time when you need to step back. I've been very careful with Bumrah,"" Rohit said. ""Akash and Siraj are the (other) frontline seamers. It's just that they've been unfortunate to not be on the wickets column. Siraj, especially, is bowling his heart out. I don't think there's anything else he can do. Obviously, there are technical aspects of his game he's looking into.""The likes of Australia's Mark Waugh have suggested that Rohit's bad patch has also started affecting his captaincy. ""A few results have not gone our way. As a captain, that's disappointing. We need to look at those things, try and see what we can correct, what we didn't do well as players and as a team,"" Rohit said.""The pain of losing a Test match is more (than batters not scoring runs). The batters, they sometimes perform, they sometimes don't. It is much more painful if you don't get the desired results. When you have the opportunity to grab hold of a game, you should. We had the chance (here),"" he rued.Right now, Rohit is having to grapple with career-defining issues. Hopefully, India's captain will find more luck in Sydney than he did here at the MCG.",India captain Rohit Sharma admits his lack of runs is 'disturbing' India lost the fifth Test against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

(Photo by Daniel Pockett/Getty Images)

MELBOURNE: Things may well have turned out differently for India if opener Yashasvi Jaiswal , who was carrying the team's hopes and batting on a well-made 84, not been given out in contentious circumstances by TV umpire Sharfuddoula Saikat.Jaiswal, after having blunted Australia's attack through the middle session along with Rishabh Pant - cutting fiercely, defending solidly and riding his luck, to an extent - saw his attempt at hooking a short ball from Australia captain Pat Cummins land in wicketkeeper Alex Carey 's gloves.This was late in the day's play, with Australia desperate for wickets. Convinced there was a deflection off the gloves or the bat, they immediately appealed, and Cummins went upstairs after on-field umpire Joel Wilson ruled not out.The replays appeared to show an obvious deflection. ""I can see a deflection off the gloves, I can see a clear contact with the gloves,"" Sharfuddoula was heard saying. However, the RTS (RealTime Snicko) didn't pick up the noise and showed a flat line as the ball went past gloves and bat.Despite the evidence from the technology, the third umpire stuck to his original observation and overturned the on-field umpire's decision, immediately cleaving opinion among experts, viewers and spectators watching on the giant screen.An irate Jaiswal spoke to the on-field umpires before storming off, and as a section of the MCG crowd kept chanting for his return, former ICC umpire Simon Taufel told Channel 7, ""With tech protocols we have a hierarchy of redundancy. When the third umpire sees a clear deflection off the bat, there really is no need to go any further and see any other forms of tech. It was the correct decision.""The two captains later seemed to support Taufel's observation. ""The tech didn't show anything but with the naked eye it seemed like he did touch something,"" Rohit Sharma said. ""I don't know how the umpires want to use the tech but in all fairness, I think he did touch the ball. The tech, we know, is not 100%.""Cummins, meanwhile, said, ""As soon as we referred, you saw him (Jaiswal) drop his head and basically acknowledge that he hit it. On screen, you can see he hit it. Ultra-Edge, don't think anyone has complete confidence (in it).""Some commentators, however, disagreed, as did the crowd. Mark Nicholas termed it a ""brave"" call while Sanjay Manjrekar said, ""Any other umpire would have gone, 'If the Snicko is not showing it, I'm not going to give it out'"".Sunil Gavaskar termed it ""an optical illusion"". ""If the technology evidence suggests it is not out, then you cannot give it out,"" Gavaskar said.Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting went the other way, saying, ""They can make of it what they like. That clearly hit the glove.""Since the captains have not made an issue of it, the matter should rest there. However, the question remains, if Snicko is a second line of referral for the third umpire after visual confirmation, then why show the Snicko or Ultra-Edge on screen or ask for it at all? After all, isn't Snicko usually presumed to be the final port of call in many other similar dismissals?","India opener Yashasvi Jaiswal given out by TV umpire Sharfuddoula Saikat. replays appeared to show an obvious deflection.

Sometimes, not often, a year in sports is like countries marching out in alphabetical order at an Olympics opening ceremony. Only here, the first letter is not G for Greece, like at the Games, but A for Annum (Latin for year, for Gen X’s benefit).This year at the Paris opening ceremony, the letters rolled in off boats on the Seine, and under pouring rain even as Zizou (Zidane, for Gen Z) in a suit and white sneakers, brought in the torch jogging through the city’s underground to hand it to adopted son, Rafa, waiting anxiously at the foot of the Eiffel. The Brits hated it, what else? The French couldn’t care less. It was that kind of a year.TOI’s Moushumi Bora is master of ceremony for the closing of 2024, lining up events of a breathless past 12 months. Of course, with a little help from friends…Despite neighbours not being good friends anymore, Neeraj Chopra and Arshad Nadeem represent the hope that one can rise above the politics. The Pakistani, with one mighty throw, stole the Olympics javelin gold away, and then added a hefty one to show that was no fluke. It was Nadeem’s day, Chopra acknowledged, paying tribute in defeat during the midnight show in the subcontinent. A born winner, silver wasn’t quite the colour the Indian wanted. It wasn’t about India or Pakistan; it was about competition at the highest level. And humility & respect. When Nadeem wished ‘Happy Birthday’ to Neeraj on Christmas Eve, the message was clear.They called it the great robbery. The result of France Football’s prestigious award was leaked before the ceremony. The whisper was Rodri got the nod over favourite Vinicius, and the whole Real Madrid team proceeded with a loud boycott of the gala. Things were different in Jeddah as Vini was adjudged FIFA’s Best. All was forgotten, but not forgiven.Did you hear Pep Guardiola’s squad shooting themselves in the feet? It’s a script fit for Ian Fleming – a sprightly 99-year-old Dick van Dyke would agree – as the thoroughbreds of Manchester find themselves panting. Although the finishing episode is halfway away, the unfolding season after a fourth consecutive Premiership triumph gets even more intriguing. Nine defeats, two wins in 14 games; battered front and centre; clueless, fight-less and flightless; Pep scratching his head and face in disbelief; a legal wrangle – all the makings of a thriller, not a musical. Call James, not Rodri (guess?)Under whom India broke a 13-year trophy drought with a near-perfect outing at the T20 World Cup. The triumph marked the end of Rahul Dravid’s tenure as coach, and the entry of Gautam Gambhir. The less said the better as it has been taxing times for the new regime.Gamers got excited as everything ‘E’ hit the mark worldwide. The Esports World Cup was staged in Saudi Arabia, emerging capital of the sports world. And the kingdom’s insatiable appetite to keep shaping the sporting map is unlikely to diminish with the staging of the inaugural Olympic Esports Games in 2025 as a precursor to a future bid for the real thing. The massive spending on global sports driven by the Crown Prince came with dividends as they were announced as the host of the 2034 football World Cup. Are we still talking about E-sports? Stop.It was a 100m race for the ages. The world stopped, time as well. Even Noah Lyles and Kishane Thompson — fighting for the crown of the fastest man on the earth — didn’t know. The race had lasted less than 10 seconds, and those minutes of wait that followed felt like an eternity. Till the scoreboard flashed — Noah Lyles. He had edged Jamaican Thompson by five thousandths of a second (9.784s to 9.789s) in a race where eight of the participants ran sub-10.This time, we fought a war on the chess board, thankfully. China’s Ding Liren matched wits with Gukesh Dommaraju, all of 18, to defend his turf. The World championship title was at stake, and it took all 14 games for Gukesh to cut the mustard. Magnus Carlsen , Vladimir Kramnik and Garry Kasparov, the erstwhile torchbearers of sixty-four squares, were not amused by the quality of moves and mistakes. Nonetheless, Gukesh laid claim to the most intelligent moniker exploiting Liren’s “schoolboy” slip on the chessboard. For once, India pipped China to the post.Those 100g that stood between Vinesh Phogat and an Olympic medal (gold, silver, gold? We will never know).

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Irfan Pathan has offered a blunt critique of Virat Kohli 's recent performances, particularly his persistent issues with shots outside the off-stump. Speaking on Star Sports after India's heavy 184-run defeat to Australia in the Boxing Day Test, Pathan highlighted Kohli's struggles as a key factor in India's underwhelming display.""Both the seniors (Rohit and Virat) did not meet expectations. They did not meet their own expectations at all. They are making mistakes,"" Pathan said, addressing the form of both Kohli and skipper Rohit Sharma Focusing on Kohli's long-standing tendency to chase deliveries outside the off-stump, Pathan expressed frustration over the lack of correction in the batter's technique.""The shot by Virat Kohli - this is neither the first nor the last time. He is not letting go of the temptation to drive outside the off-stump,"" Pathan remarked, adding that the issue has plagued Kohli for years.Pathan also questioned why Kohli, renowned for his off-field discipline and meticulous preparation, has struggled to bring the same focus to his batting.""We all talk about his discipline - why can't he bring that discipline onto the field?""

NEW DELHI: India's chances of qualifying for the World Test Championship final for the third consecutive time suffered a major blow as they lost the Boxing Day Test against Australia by 184 runs at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Monday. Chasing a record 340-run target, India were all out for 155 in the final session of the fifth and final day of the fourth Test.Meanwhile, Australia have bettered their chances to face South Africa in the WTC Final at Lord's next year with the win. The Proteas have booked their spot in the WTC final after a thrilling two-wicket win over Pakistan at SuperSport Park, Centurion on Sunday.With the victory, Australia also took an unassailable 2-1 lead in the five-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy series, with the final Test scheduled to start from Friday, January 3, at the Sydney Cricket Ground.Young opener Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rishabh Pant kept India's hopes alive till tea break on the final day, but one false shot from the latter triggered a batting collapse which resulted in the visitors losing seven wickets for just 34 runs in the end.As India lost the plot in the WTC Final race, let's recap how they suffered the big defeat at the MCG:Australia promised to throw something different at India with the inclusion of batting prodigy 19-year-old Sam Konstas in the playing XI for the MCG Test and it turned out to be true. Konstas came out of syllabus for the Indian attack on the opening day of the Test after Pat Cummins opted to bat first after winning the toss.Konstas attacked Indian bowlers, including the impressive Jasprit Bumrah , and set the tone for the Australian innings. The youngster smashed 60 off 65 balls, with the help of two sixes and six fours, and added a quick 89 runs for the opening wicket in just 19.2 overs. His pyrotechnics helped the hosts top-order batters, who were out-of-form in the series, to get back into the groove as they fired in unison.Konstas' opening partner Usman Khawaja scored 57, off 121 balls, and No.3 batter Marnus Labuschagne contributed 72, off 175 balls. India fought back a bit in the final session of the opening day by taking four wickets, but Australia finished the day at 311 for 6 with Steve Smith batting on 68* along with Cummins (8*).The second day, especially the first session, belonged to Australia's batting maestro Steve Smith. Smith completed his 34th Test hundred in the morning and set a new record of most centuries against India in Test cricket history. It was his 11th Test hundred against India, one more than the previous record of 10 he shared with England's Joe Root. Smith scored a majestic 140, off 197 balls, which included three maximums and 13 fours before he was clean bowled by Akash Deep. By then Australia had breached the 450-run mark in their first innings.Smith added a valuable 112 runs for the seventh wicket Cummins (49 off 63) to lead the Australian innings. And the duo played a big role in Australia posting a mammoth 474 runs in their first essay.India started their first innings on the wrong foot again. Captain Rohit Sharma decided to promote himself to the opening spot, but failed to contribute. Two early wickets and India were reeling at 51/2 at tea on Day 2. Jaiswal and Virat Kohli steadied the innings and rebuilt it to a comfortable 153/2, before a big mix-up between the youngster and the veteran batter ended the former's stay in the middle.Jaiswal walked back after a brilliant 82, off 118 balls, and seven balls later Kohli's patience broke as he edged one to keeper Alex Carey off Scott Boland. India's situation worsened when nightwatchman Akash Deep too fell in the penultimate over of the day as India were reduced to 164/5 at stumps.Rishabh Pant (28) and Ravindra Jadeja (17) got the start but failed to play a longer innings and India were on the verge of follow-on again, at 221/7, when Nitish Kumar Reddy was joined by Washington Sundar in the middle on Day 3. India needed 54 more to make Australia bat again in the match. But what happened next was pure magic for India.Nitish Reddy and Sundar kept the Aussie attack at bay with some prolific batting as the duo helped India avoid follow-on first and frustrated the hosts with a century partnership. They added a terrific 127 runs for the 8th wicket to take India to a comfortable 348/8 when Sundar was dismissed by Nathan Lyon. Sundar scored a patient 50 off 162 balls.Then Nitish Reddy scored his maiden Test hundred in his debut series, with No.11 batter Mohammed Siraj keeping one end intact to the amusement of the crowd at the MCG. Reddy's hundred took India to 358/9 at the close of the third day's play.After India finished at 369 all out with the dismissal of Nitish Reddy on day four at 114, Australia made a cautious start after getting a 105-run first innings lead.Bumrah came to the fore for India in the second session of the fourth day with his record breaking 200th wicket, making him the only bowler with sub-20 average among those with 200 or more wickets in Test history. And along with Mohammed Siraj, who came back to wicket-taking ways, India grabbed four Australian wickets in the mid session of Day 4 to reduce Australia 91/6. But dropped catches began to hurt India as Jaiswal missed three big chances in the hosts’ second innings.Riding on the chances provided by the drop catches, Labuschagne (70) and Cummins (41) stretched Australia's lead to past the 250-run mark with a 57-run stand for the seventh wicket. After that Australia's last wicket partnership of 61 runs between Lyon (41) and Boland (15 not out) set India a target of 340 on the final day.India's run chase started on a disastrous note, as they lost three batters for 33 at lunch on the final day. Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Virat Kohli failed to put up any fight against the Aussie pacers in the morning session. With the visitors in dire situation after the top-order failures, Jaiswal and Pant put up a fightback to keep India's hopes alive.The duo played out the entire second session, scoring 79 runs in it. But the start of the final session saw Pant going for a pull shot off Travis Head only to be out caught in the deep by Mitchell Marsh. The end of the 88-run stand triggered the familiar India batting collapse as they were all out for 155 from a comfortable position of 121 for 3 in the final session.Jaiswal top-scored for India in the second innings with 84, off 208 balls, before falling to a controversial third umpire decision. While Pant contributed 30, no other batters managed to reach double figures as India suffered a humiliating 184 runs defeat in Melbourne.","India's chances of qualifying for World Test Championship final suffered a major blow as they lost the Boxing Day Test against Australia by 184 runs.

NEW DELHI: India skipper Rohit Sharma voiced concerns over Jasprit Bumrah 's heavy workload and lack of bowling support following India's 184-run defeat in the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.Bumrah, India's pace spearhead, delivered a masterclass with match figures of 9-156, including a five-wicket haul in the third innings, taking his series tally to 30 wickets. His exceptional performance also saw him become the fastest Indian pacer to 200 Test wickets and the first bowler in history to maintain a sub-20 average among bowlers with 200 or more Test scalps.However, Bumrah's herculean efforts were not enough to secure victory, as Rohit highlighted the physical toll on the pacer and the absence of adequate support from the other end.""There is a risk of over-bowling Bumrah, but when someone is in form, you tend to bowl him more,"" Rohit admitted during the post-match press briefing, reflecting on the pacer's workload.Rohit had relied heavily on Bumrah throughout the match. Bumrah's exhaustion was evident by the end of Day 4, when the pacer was heard telling his captain, ""Bus ab, ab bilkul dum nahi lag raha (No more. I can't put in any more effort).""The skipper also lamented the lack of support for Bumrah, which he felt had been a persistent issue.""Absolutely brilliant. We've been watching him for so many years now, coming here and getting the job done. He's not a statistical person. He just wants to play for the country and do well for the team, but unfortunately, he's not got a lot of support from the other side,"" Rohit said, praising Bumrah's selfless approach.Team India's chances of qualifying for a third consecutive World Test Championship final took a significant hit with the defeat. Chasing a challenging target of 340 runs, India faltered to 155 all out, losing seven wickets for just 34 runs in the final session.Young opener Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rishabh Pant kept India's hopes alive until tea with a gritty partnership, but the collapse that followed underscored the team's vulnerabilities.With the series now 2-1 in Australia's favour and the final Test set to begin at the Sydney Cricket Ground on January 3, the pressure is on India to manage Bumrah's workload effectively and find the much-needed support for their ace pacer.","India skipper Rohit Sharma voiced concerns over Jasprit Bumrah's heavy workload and lack of bowling support following India's 184-run defeat in the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.Bumrah delivered a masterclass with match figures of 9-156, including a five-wicket haul in the third innings.

India, chasing a target of 340, adopted a cautious approach during their innings. Australia's bowlers maintained consistent pressure with high-quality deliveries, forcing Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal to restrain their attacking instincts. This allowed Australia to establish a dominant rhythm.Speaking exclusively on Star Sports, former Indian head coach Ravi Shastri shared his thoughts on Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma's performances in the ongoing series.""Virat batted well in the first innings. He'll be disappointed with the way he's getting out because there's a pattern—driving outside the off stump. He could leave those deliveries. As far as Rohit Sharma goes, at times we've seen in the series that his front foot isn't really moving towards the ball as much as it should. There’s a trigger movement, but then the leg stays planted. Mitchell Starc set Virat Kohli up beautifully. An over before that, there were some good leaves from Virat, but they were challenging the off stump. And here, he floated one outside, tempting Virat—'should I leave it, should I play'—just before lunch. Virat would have been very disappointed,"" Shastri said.Rohit Sharma's attempt at an aggressive shot led to his dismissal. Aiming to whip a Pat Cummins delivery through the leg side, he edged the ball to gully, departing for nine runs off 40 balls.On the final ball of the same over, KL Rahul edged a back-of-a-length delivery from Cummins to second slip and was dismissed for a five-ball duck.Just before lunch, Kohli attempted an expansive drive off Mitchell Starc's full-length delivery and was caught at first slip for five off 29 balls.Shastri then expressed his opinion on Rishabh Pant, saying, ""I think the turning point was the wicket of Rishabh Pant. They knew they couldn't win the game by lunchtime once they lost three wickets. The only chance you have of winning is if there’s a platform set, exactly what Rohit said in the press conference. And then, when Rishabh Pant got out after tea, that lifted the Australians. That was the opening they were looking for, and they made sure to capitalise on it."" he concluded.Rishabh Pant and Yashasvi Jaiswal forged an 88-run partnership for the fourth wicket. Pant contributed 30 runs from 104 balls, while Jaiswal's crucial innings yielded 84 runs. Their partnership provided a glimmer of hope for India in their challenging chase.With India seemingly aiming for a draw, Pant's aggressive approach led to his dismissal. Attempting a powerful shot off Travis Head's bowling, he was caught at long-on, handing Australia a crucial breakthrough at 121-4.Following Pant's dismissal, India lost three wickets in quick succession for just nine runs. Scott Boland dismissed Ravindra Jadeja, caught behind, and Nitish Kumar Reddy edged a Nathan Lyon delivery to slip.Yashasvi Jaiswal, who had anchored the Indian innings, eventually fell for 84, dismissed by Pat Cummins. His patient knock provided resistance but ultimately couldn't prevent India's collapse.Scott Boland further deepened India's woes by dismissing Akash Deep and later Jasprit Bumrah .

'ROHIT KNEW YASHASVI WAS INDIA’S FUTURE'

NEW DELHI: Disappointment and frustration were clearly visible on Yashasvi Jaiswal 's face as he fell victim to a controversial dismissal during the final session of day five in the Boxing Day Test at the MCG. The third umpire overturned the on-field not-out decision for a caught-behind, even though the Snickometer showed no edge.Yashasvi, who was anchoring the innings brilliantly and batting on 84, attempted to hook a bouncer from Australian skipper Pat Cummins . He missed the shot entirely, and wicketkeeper Alex Carey claimed the catch. While Carey and Cummins celebrated exuberantly, on-field umpire Joel Wilson initially ruled it not out. Cummins, however, immediately opted for a review.The Snickometer displayed a flat line as the ball passed the bat, regular replays showed a noticeable deflection. Third umpire Sharfuddoula ultimately declared Jaiswal out, to the batter’s disbelief.The decision sparked widespread debate among former cricketers and fans alike. However, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma addressed the controversy during the post-match press conference, seeking to put the matter to rest.""I don't know what to make of that because the technology didn't show anything, but with the naked eye it seemed like he did touch something,"" Rohit told reporters after the match.""I don't know how the umpires want to use the technology, but in all fairness, I think he did touch the ball,"" he said.Yashasvi's childhood coach, Jwala Singh, who was at the MCG to witness the high-stakes match, expressed his shock over the incident but said he found clarity after Rohit addressed the matter.""I was shocked, actually. The umpires took time to make that decision, and there was doubt. So, if there was doubt, the benefit of doubt should have been given to the batter. But if Rohit Sharma, the captain himself, said that there was a deflection or that the ball touched the bat or gloves, then Yashasvi is out. Because the captain knows better than anyone else. I will go with Rohit,"" Jwala told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.Jwala is well aware of Yashasvi's state of mind following the controversial dismissal but remains confident that Rohit, who has been a guiding figure throughout Yashasvi's career as a senior Mumbai teammate and now as India’s captain, will support the youngster through this challenging phase.""Rohit has given him a lot of opportunities and chances. Rohit has backed Yashasvi a lot. He has been his senior in the Mumbai team, and now he is the captain. Yashasvi has learned a lot from Rohit and continues to do so. Yashasvi was very disappointed, and any batter would be disappointed after such a decision. He needs to move on. Rohit will talk to him. Whenever Yashasvi is down or disappointed, Rohit is always there to motivate him and talk to him. He will ask him to move on. Not just Rohit, (Gautam) Gambhir also talks to him and motivates him. Rohit and Gambhir will help Yashasvi overcome this on-field disappointment,"" Jwala said.Yashasvi has been a standout performer in Tests in 2024, amassing 1,478 runs at an average of 54.74, including three centuries and nine fifties in 15 matches (including the MCG Test). His highest score this year was an unbeaten 214 against England.The youngster also surpassed Virender Sehwag’s 2008 tally of 1,462 runs to record the best calendar year for an Indian opener. He now ranks fourth on the all-time list for openers, topped by Graeme Smith’s 1,656 runs in 2008.Jwala recounted a story where Rohit had predicted Yashasvi's bright future for India.""I will share an incident when Yashasvi scored a double century in the Vijay Hazare Trophy some years back. Rohit was present there, and he appreciated Yashasvi and told everyone that this guy has got a bright future and will play for India. Yashasvi became emotional and worked really hard to reach this level. Rohit has always given Yashasvi a lot of support and helped him grow as an international cricketer,"" the coach said.""Yashasvi is a player to watch out for in the future. He was looking good, and I was confident he would take India to a draw or maybe even a win if he had good support from the other end. He was in good touch, but the controversial decision ended his innings. I am happy for him but also unhappy because he missed out on hundreds in both innings. He had a great opportunity to score centuries in both innings,"" he added.",Yashasvi Jaiswal was out for 84 on Day 5 of the Boxing Day Test at the MCG. The third umpire overturned the on-field not-out decision for a caught-behind. The decision sparked widespread debate among former cricketers and fans alike.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116814144,imgsize-1521882,width-400,resizemode-4/116814144.jpg"

Late Drama and Rain-Shortened Day

Looking Ahead

The first Test between Zimbabwe and Afghanistan in Bulawayo ended in a thrilling draw on Monday, with both teams achieving record-breaking feats.Zimbabwe's first innings saw them amass a colossal 586 runs, surpassing their previous highest Test score of 563/9 against the West Indies in 2001. Afghanistan responded with an even more remarkable 699 all out, establishing their own record for the highest innings total, beating their previous best of 545/4, also achieved against Zimbabwe in 2021.The Afghan innings was highlighted by captain Hashmatullah Shahidi 's historic 246, a national record, and Rahmat Shah's 234. Together, they forged a massive 364-run third-wicket partnership, the highest in Afghanistan's Test history for any wicket. Shahidi’s 246 eclipsed his previous best of 200 against Zimbabwe in Abu Dhabi. Wicketkeeper Afsar Zazai also contributed a maiden Test century with 113 runs, further solidifying Afghanistan's dominance in their first innings.Zimbabwe's Brian Bennett, a 21-year-old spinner in only his second Test, showcased his all-around brilliance. Bennett took a career-best 5/95 in Afghanistan's innings and earlier contributed an unbeaten 110 with the bat in Zimbabwe's first innings.Afghanistan’s innings ended in a collapse, with the last six wickets falling for just 20 runs in four overs, largely due to Bennett's spin. In their second innings, Zimbabwe reached 142/4, avoiding further damage thanks to an unbroken 54-run partnership between veterans Sean Williams (35) and Craig Ervine (22).The match's conclusion was impacted by mid-afternoon rain, which caused a delay of over an hour. Zimbabwe showed resilience, with debutant Ben Curran impressing with 41 runs before a run-out, and opener Joylord Gumbie contributing 24.The second and final Test of the series begins Thursday, also in Bulawayo, with both teams eager to build on the momentum from this high-scoring encounter.For context, Sri Lanka still hold the record for the highest-ever Test innings score with 952/6 declared against India in Colombo in 1997.","The first Test between Zimbabwe and Afghanistan in Bulawayo ended in a thrilling draw on Monday.

A thrilling first Test match between Afghanistan and Zimbabwe ended in a draw after a rain-affected final day in Bulawayo. Both teams showcased impressive batting performances, resulting in record-breaking innings. Hashmatullah Shahidi , the Afghanistan veteran, etched his name in the record books with a monumental 246 runs. Zimbabwean rookie spinner Brian Bennett also shone, claiming five wickets in an impressive spell.Zimbabwe's first innings total of 586 was a national record. Afghanistan responded with an even more remarkable 699, also a national record. Zimbabwe finished their second innings at 142-4, leading Afghanistan by a slender 29 runs.The partnership between Sean Williams (35 not out) and Craig Ervine (22 not out) proved crucial for Zimbabwe. Their unbeaten stand stabilized the innings after Zimbabwe found themselves in a precarious position at 88-4, trailing by 25 runs.Shahidi's marathon innings finally came to an end when he was trapped leg before wicket by Bennett. Bennett's figures of 5-95 were the best among the Zimbabwean bowlers.Shahidi's 246 runs came off 474 balls and included 21 fours. His remarkable innings lasted for 694 minutes at Queens Sports Club.Shahidi's partnerships with Rahmat Shah (364 runs) and Afsar Zazai (211 runs) were instrumental in Afghanistan gaining a substantial 113-run first-innings lead.Shahidi's previous highest Test score was 200 not out, also against Zimbabwe in Abu Dhabi three years ago.Afsar Zazai, the Afghanistan wicketkeeper, celebrated his maiden Test century, scoring 113 before being dismissed. He was caught at backward point by substitute fielder Johnathan Campbell.Shahidi's dismissal triggered a mini-collapse for Afghanistan. The last six wickets tumbled for a mere 20 runs in just four overs, with Bennett's off-spin proving particularly destructive.Bennett, playing in just his second Test, twice came agonizingly close to a hat-trick. He took two wickets in consecutive deliveries on two separate occasions.Bennett also contributed significantly with the bat, scoring an unbeaten 110 in Zimbabwe's first innings.

Pat Cummins on India’s approach on Day 5, Rishabh Pant’s shot and Travis Head’s celebration

NEW DELHI: Former cricketers and experts have touted Shubman Gill as the next big thing ever since he announced his arrival on the international scene. But a string of promising starts lately that he hasn't been able to convert into big innings has probably left India's chief coach frustrated, feels former England spinner Monty Panesar Gill, who averages 35.76 for his 1860 runs across 57 innings in 31 Tests, was dropped from the Melbourne Test for off-spin all-rounder Washington Sundar. Though Sundar did play his part with the bat scoring 50 in a 127-run partnership with centurion Nitish Reddy (114), the move to drop Gill and move KL Rahul to No. 3 so that Rohit can return as opener didn't help sort India's batting woes.India's first-innings total of 369 in Melbourne was only made possible by the knocks played by all-rounders Reddy and Sundar while the specialist batters, barring Yashasvi Jaiswal, failed once again. In the second innings, India could muster only 155.Chasing 340 to win, India's last 7 wickets fell for just 34 runs despite Jaiswal following up his 82 in the first innings with 84 in the second.Will that mean Gill returning to the top order for the last Test in Sydney, which India need to win to make it 2-2 and retain theBorder Gavaskar Trophy ?""Gill hasn't performed like he needs to as a number three. I think he gets (good) starts and then gets out,"" said Panesar talking to""I think he is promising, but hasn't really kicked...averages like 36 (in Tests). To be honest, that needs to be like 45 (with) the talent that he has.""Gill has featured in just two of the four Tests played so far in this Border Gavaskar Trophy. He missed the first Test in Perth with a thumb fracture and was dropped for the fourth in Melbourne. In between, his three innings brought him just 60 runs with knocks of 31, 28 and 1.He got off to good starts in the pink-ball Test at Adelaide but failed to make it count.""Sometimes he gets a little bit lazy or lethargic with his footwork, just gets out when he makes a good start,"" Panesar analysed. ""India are in a nice position and then he just gets out. I think Gambhir is probably frustrated with that thing. Enough's enough,"" felt Panesar.He added that getting dropped from the Melbourne Test should work as a ""wake-up call"" for Gill.""He's a better player than that. He shouldn't be averaging just 36 in Test cricket. He's had a lot of chances and he's getting a little bit complacent, you know, thinking that 'Oh, I have the talent, I'll just keep playing, I'll keep getting better'."", the former left-arm spinner said.Interestingly, Rohit was asked how he views the situation with the 25-year-old Gill, especially after India's big 284-run defeat in Melbourne.""I had a chat with him...and the chat was clearly (that) he was not dropped. We just wanted to have that extra bit of cushion in the bowling and hence we opted for an allrounder (Sundar), which would not weaken our batting lineup. Compromising a batter for a bowler was not something that I wanted to do,"" said Rohit.""With him, there was never a doubt that he was not batting well or he was not scoring runs or anything like that. It was just to get that combination where we can cover both bases - batting and bowling. We opted for that option, of course,"" the skipper added.The fifth and final Test in Sydney begins on January 3.",Shubman Gill was dropped from the Melbourne Test for off-spin all-rounder Washington Sundar.

This follows India’s 184-run defeat in the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Pathan suggests that Rohit’s place in the team is primarily due to his captaincy, rather than his batting performance.Rohit’s struggles with the bat have become a talking point, particularly after a series of low scores in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy. His poor form is considered a major contributing factor to India’s disappointing performance against Australia.In five innings, Rohit has scored a mere 31 runs, averaging 6.20, including two ducks. This is the second-lowest series average for an Indian top-six batter in Tests played in Australia.His difficulty in converting starts and apparent lack of rhythm against Australia’s bowling attack have placed him under significant pressure. On Day 5, Rohit faced 40 balls, scoring only nine runs before being dismissed by“A player who has made about 20,000 runs—yet the way Rohit is struggling now, it seems his form is not supporting him at all. What’s happening now is that he is the captain, so he is playing. If he were not the captain, he might not be playing right now. You would have had a set team. K.L. Rahul would have been playing at the top, Jaiswal would have been there, Shubman Gill would have been there. If we talk about reality, considering how he is struggling with the bat, there might not have been a place for him in the playing XI,” Irfan Pathan told Star Sports.Pathan believes that without the captaincy, players like KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal , or Shubman Gill would be more likely to open the innings, given their current form. He contends that Rohit’s position is secured by his captaincy, especially with India needing a win to draw the series.“But because he is the captain, and you want to win the next match to draw the series, he stays in the team. But his form is so poor. Even in India, even before coming here, he wasn’t scoring runs, and he still hasn’t scored runs. This is a very disappointing scene when I see Rohit Sharma batting. Because whenever I see Rohit Sharma batting, I always want to see him bat, whether it is Test cricket or one-day cricket. But now, his form, the way he is going forward, whether it is his mindset or the coordination with his body, I can’t see that at all,” he added.Rohit’s performance in early 2024 against England, where he scored 455 runs, presented a stark contrast to his current struggles. The series against England fuelled hopes of a Test resurgence, but his form has since declined significantly.The Boxing Day Test highlighted Rohit’s vulnerabilities against the Australian attack. Despite occasional displays of resilience, he failed to make a substantial contribution. His longest innings in the series, a 40-ball, nine-run effort, epitomises his difficulties throughout the tour.","Former Indian all-rounder Irfan Pathan has expressed concerns regarding India’s Test captain, Rohit Sharma ’s position in the team, given his ongoing poor form.

Nitish Reddy reveals Virat Kohli’s special words for him after hundred at MCG

London: Liverpool moved a step closer to a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title as a 5-0 thrashing of West Ham opened up an eight-point lead at the top of the Premier League Luis Diaz , Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah , Trent Alexander-Arnold and Diogo Jota were on target for the rampant Reds in east London as they ended the year as huge favourites to deliver just a second league title in 35 years.Nottingham Forest are the surprise closest challengers in second, but Arsenal and Chelsea can close the gap when they are in action later in the week.Arne Slot has repeatedly stressed nothing can be won yet with Liverpool still one game shy of the halfway mark in the Premier League.But the Dutchman's succession of Jurgen Klopp continues to look flawless after a 23rd win in 27 matches in all competitions.""I enjoyed it a lot because it doesn't happen many times that I could just sit back and enjoy,"" said Slot.Diaz had been rested for the 3-1 win over Leicester on Boxing Day and it was the Colombian who opened the floodgates on 30 minutes at the London Stadium.His intended pass into Curtis Jones rebounded back into his path off a West Ham defender and he dispatched his shot low into the corner.Mohammed Kudus was inches away from an equaliser when his effort came back off the post.But another heavy home defeat puts Hammers boss Julen Lopetegui back under pressure after a four-game unbeaten run.""We are talking about the best team in the Premier League and around the world, but at home and in front of our fans, I am very sorry about this,"" said Lopetegui.Two goals in four minutes just before half-time killed the game as a contest.Salah's delightful turn helped tee up Gakpo to roll in his ninth goal in 14 games.The Egyptian then curled in at Alphonse Areola's near post, with some help from the West Ham goalkeeper, to hit the 20-goal mark for the eighth consecutive season since joining Liverpool in 2017.Speculation over Alexander-Arnold, Salah and Virgil van Dijk's futures has not derailed Liverpool's flying start under Slot.All three could discuss a move to a foreign club on a free transfer next season within days, but remain focused for the moment on winning a second Premier League title together.""The only thing in my mind is that I want Liverpool to win the league and I want to be part of it,"" said Salah.""That is the only thing I have focused on. I will do my best to win the trophy. We are in the right direction but there are other teams trying to catch up with us. We just need to stay humble and go again.""Rumours over Alexander-Arnold's potential move to Real Madrid have resurfaced again in the Spanish media over the past week and the England international showed why he is a man in demand with a thunderous strike that deflected in off Max Kilman.Jota's appearance as a substitute was further evidence of the extra firepower Liverpool enjoy over their title rivals.The Portuguese set the seal on a dominant win with the finish for the fifth goal, but had another sumptuous Salah assist to thank for it.Salah jinked his way beyond three West Ham defenders before laying the ball to Jota for his 13th Premier League assist of the season to go with 17 goals in 18 games.","Liverpool thrash West Ham 5-0 at the London Stadium. Luis Diaz, Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Diogo Jota on target. Liverpool now eight points clear at the top of the Premier League.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116783240,imgsize-163286,width-400,resizemode-4/116783240.jpg"
