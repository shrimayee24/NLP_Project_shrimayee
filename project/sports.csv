Fast bowler Pat Cummins led the bowling unit with a hat-trick and David Warner 's unbeaten half-century ensured no hiccups with the bat as Australia cruised to a win over Bangladesh in their 'Super 8s' match in Group 1 of the T20 World Cup , even as rain threatened to play spoilsport in Antigua on Friday (IST).Australia secured a 28-run victory over Bangladesh via the DLS method, thanks to the exceptional performances of Cummins and leg-spinner Adam Zampa before Warner & Co took charge of the run-chase.Cummins claimed the tournament's first hat-trick in the final overs, while Zampa showcased his precision in the middle overs, as Bangladesh were restricted to 140 for 8 after being asked to bat first by Mitchell Marsh.Australia's chase was led by the experienced Warner, who smashed an unbeaten 53 off just 35 balls, including five fours and three sixes. Along with Travis Head (31), Warner got the Aussies off to a flying start, racing to 60/0 before rain interrupted play.Despite losing some momentum after the break, with young leg-spinner Rishad Hossain (2/23 in 3 overs) dismissing Head and Mitchell Marsh (1) in quick succession, Australia remained in control. Warner, playing in his last T20 World Cup, brought up his half-century with a majestic six, showcasing his dominance.When rain stopped play for the second time, Australia were comfortably ahead of the DLS par score, with 100 for 2 in 11.2 overs, 28 runs ahead of the required target of 72. The victory showcased the depth and quality of the Australian team, as they continue their march ahead in the tournament strongly.In the opening over of the match, Mitchell Starc, the left-arm pacer, provided Australia with the anticipated early breakthrough by dismissing Tanzid Hasan. With this wicket, Starc surpassed Sri Lankan legend Lasith Malinga to become the leading wicket-taker in World Cups with 95 scalps.The innings was stabilized by Litton Das (16) and captain Najmul Hossain Shanto (41), who put together a 58-run partnership. In the fourth over, Shanto hit a six off Josh Hazlewood over long-on. He then targeted Starc, hitting a couple of fours in the fifth over.However, Zampa immediately ended the partnership, trapping Das leg before wicket in the ninth over. Australian spinners Zampa and Glenn Maxwell applied pressure on Bangladesh, restricting them to only 26 runs from the ninth to the 13th over while also dismissing Rishad Hossain (2) besides taking the crucial wicket of Shanto, who fell to Zampa.Hridoy (40 off 28) helped Bangladesh surpass the 100-run mark and attempted to boost his team's total. He hit consecutive sixes off Marcus Stoinis. However, Cummins made a significant impact in the latter stages of the innings, dashing any hopes of a strong finish by Bangladesh.At the end of the 18th over, Cummins took wickets off successive deliveries. Mahmudullah tried to play a pull shot but ended up playing the ball back onto his stumps. Cummins then had Mahedi Hasan caught by Zampa. He returned to bowl the final over and dismissed Hridoy with his first ball, completing the hat-trick -- the first of this T20 World Cup.",Australia beat Bangladesh by 28 runs in Group 1 of T20 World Cup in Antigua. Fast bowler Pat Cummins took a hat-trick and David Warner hit an unbeaten 53. The Aussies reached 100-2 in 11.2 overs before rain stopped play for the second time.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111156855,imgsize-52336,width-400,resizemode-4/111156855.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India, a formidable force in the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup , is set to face Bangladesh in their second Super Eight stage match at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium on Saturday. With a quick turnaround between games, both teams will prioritize rest and recovery while strategizing to put their best foot forward in this crucial encounter.India seamlessly transitioned from the challenging conditions in the USA to the familiar West Indies, securing a comfortable 47-run victory over Afghanistan in their first Super 8 stage game in Barbados. They now face the test of excelling in Antigua, where scores of 150 and above have been recorded four times.India's top priority will be for their opening pair, captain Rohit Sharma and the talismanic Virat Kohli, who hasn't looked convincing so far, to forge a significant partnership. With key contributions from Suryakumar Yadav , Hardik Pandya , Rishabh Pant, and Axar Patel in the batting department against Afghanistan, India will also hope for designated spin-hitter Shivam Dube to join the run-scoring party.India is expected to retain the playing eleven from their match against Afghanistan, which would see left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav keep his place after taking two wickets in his first T20 World Cup game. The bowlers continued their impressive form, with Jasprit Bumrah rattling Afghanistan with a spell of 3-7, including 20 dot balls, the fewest runs ever conceded by an Indian bowler in a Men's T20 World Cup where all four overs were bowled. Arshdeep Singh and Ravindra Jadeja also contributed with wickets, adding to another strong bowling performance by India in the tournament.Bangladesh, on the other hand, has struggled with their batting throughout the competition. While their bowlers, particularly left-arm fast-bowler Mustafizur Rahman and leg-spinner Rishad Hossain, have been performing well, they need to step up as a collective unit in this must-win game. Their challenge will be to contain India's middle and lower order and put a stop to their winning streak.India (IND) and Bangladesh (BAN) are set to clash in the seventh match of the Super Eights in the T20 World Cup 2024 at the Sir Vivan Richards Stadium in North Sound, Antigua, on June 22 at 8:00 PM IST.India has a dominant record against Bangladesh in T20Is, winning 12 out of the 13 matches played between the two teams.The pitch at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium has been lively, especially during the group stages, offering assistance to pacers who can hit the deck. Batters will need to settle in before attacking.In previous matches at this venue, teams batting second have had a slight advantage, winning 4 out of 6 matches. The average first innings total is 121, while the average second innings total is 111.For fantasy contests , consider picking players who can perform well in the powerplay overs. Bowlers who can hit the hard length and use variations effectively will be key.(IND) - T20 World Cup 2024 Stats: 112 Runs in 4 Matches. He has been in good form, scoring crucial runs under pressure.(IND) - T20 World Cup 2024 Stats: 7 Wickets and 39 Runs in 4 Matches. His all-round abilities make him a valuable pick, especially on a pitch that suits his style of bowling.(BAN) - T20 World Cup 2024 Stats: 135 Runs in 5 Matches. The consistent Bangladeshi middle-order batter is a prime choice for fantasy contests.India: Rohit Sharma (c), Hardik Pandya (vc), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant (wk), Sanju Samson (wk), Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj.Bangladesh: Najmul Hossain Shanto (c), Taskin Ahmed, Litton Das, Soumya Sarkar, Tanzid Hasan Tamim, Shakib Al Hasan , Tawhid Hridoy, Mahmud Ullah Riyad, Jaker Ali Anik, Tanvir Islam, Shak Mahedi Hasan, Rishad Hossain, Mustafizur Rahman, Shoriful Islam, Tanzim Hasan Sakib.Wicketkeeper: Rishabh PantBatters: Suryakumar Yadav, Towhid HridoyAll-rounders: Shakib Al Hasan, Hardik Pandya, Rishad HossainBowlers: Jasprit Bumrah, Mustafizur Rahman, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh, Tanzim Hasan Sakib","India set to face Bangladesh in their second Super Eight stage match at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium on Saturday.

Virat Kohli is itching to rediscover his batting touch as India refocus at the T20 World Cup with their first match of the ' Super 8s ' against Afghanistan in Barbados on Thursday.Opening the batting with skipper Rohit Sharma , Kohli hasn't had the kind of start his fans expected of him at the T20 World Cup, with his three innings totaling a mere 5 runs in 9 balls.Kohli's knocks of 1, 4 and 0 have also raised questions whether asking him to open is a correct move. However, playing in the same position for Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Kohli scored a tournament-highest 741 runs in the 2024 season of the Indian Premier League just before the T20 World Cup.Facing up to the tricky Afghanistan at the Kensington Oval on Thursday, Kohli and Rohit will be up against a challenge that former South Africa speedsterDale Steyn sees as a big danger for the Indian openers""Be careful Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma; he can knock your pegs up,"" said Steyn in a Star Sports video, talking about the in-form Afghan pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi.The left-arm fast bowler has invariably tore into opposition's top order in this tournament, and his wicket-taking consistency has put him on top of the bowling charts with 12 wickets in four matches, including a best of 5 for 9. Farooqui's economy rate of 5.58 is as impressive as his wickets tally.Among the Afghan batters, Steyn felt opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz can get stuck into the Indian pacers, which makes his duel with Jasprit Bumrah as the one to watch out for.Interestingly, while Steyn alerted Kohli and Rohit to the danger posed by Farooqi, the South African didn't pick either of the two openers as the Indian batsman to watch out for in the contest.""Starting with India, from a bowling point of view, Jasprit Bumrah. Absolutely phenomenal! He's great with all three disciplines - Tests, T20s, ODIs,"" said Steyn.Talking about Indian batting, Steyn said, ""SKY (Suryakumar Yadav) is gonna come good with the bat. Just watch out for him from India's point of view.""India and Afghanistan are placed in Group 1 of the 'Super 8s' stage alongside Australia and Bangladesh.",Virat Kohli has scored just 5 runs in three innings at the T20 World Cup. Former South Africa fast bowler Dale Steyn has warned the Indian openers to be careful of Afghan pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi. Steyn picked Jasprit Bumrah as the one to watch out for in the contest.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111130453,imgsize-194682,width-400,resizemode-4/111130453.jpg"

NEW DELHI: After going unbeaten in the Group A matches of the 2024 Men’s T20 World Cup in the USA, Team India is set to begin its Super Eights campaign in the Caribbean. They will face Afghanistan at the Kensington Oval on Thursday. India's earlier matches were affected by the batting-unfriendly pitches in New York, but now, a change in conditions means possible adjustments in their lineup.In New York, conditions favored fast bowlers, causing someone like Kuldeep Yadav to miss out on playing in the Group A games. With the tournament shifting to the West Indies, there is a possibility that the team might include an extra spinner like Kuldeep Yadav, who offers different variety and control compared to Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel.The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has already announced India's 15-member squad for the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024, which is being held in the West Indies and USA starting from June 1. Rohit Sharma will captain the team, with Hardik Pandya as vice-captain.Team India’s confidence is high following their unbeaten run, but they remain cautious as they face Afghanistan, known for causing upsets. Spinner-friendly conditions in the Caribbean could impact their strategy and team composition.The inclusion of Kuldeep Yadav in the upcoming matches remains a decision to watch, as his skills bring a unique edge that could be crucial in the Caribbean conditions.India's squad for the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 features a mix of seasoned players and young talent, all eager to make a significant impact on the tournament. Led by the experienced Rohit Sharma, the team includes established batsmen likeVirat Kohli , as well as dynamic all-rounders such as Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja.Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shivam Dube bring youthful energy to the batting lineup while Surya Kumar Yadav's 360 degree game play adds another dimension to the team's batting line up. Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson will handle wicketkeeping duties. The spin department boasts strength with Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, and Yuzvendra Chahal ready to confound opponents.The fast bowling unit, spearheaded by the deadly Jasprit Bumrah, includes Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj, ensuring a formidable pace attack.The reserve players, Shubman Gill, Rinku Singh, Khaleel Ahmed, and Avesh Khan, offer robust backups, prepared to step in when needed.The team is both well-prepared and highly motivated, with a clear aim to bring the trophy back to India. This combination of experienced veterans and vibrant newcomers makes them strong contenders in every match they play.Fans are eagerly anticipating seeing the India squad showcase their skills on the international stage, hoping for a glorious performance throughout the T20 World Cup.In Group A, India's journey in the group stage begins with a match against Ireland on June 5, followed by a highly anticipated showdown against arch-rivals Pakistan on June 9.

NEW DELHI: Hardik Pandya 's struggles began in the previous year during a ODI World Cup match against Bangladesh, but the talented all-rounder never lost faith in the adage that ""fortune favours the brave if they hang around.""A series of unfortunate events followed, starting with consecutive injuries that forced him to miss four months of action.Subsequently, he endured a turbulent two-month period as the captain of Mumbai Indians in the IPL, leaving India's premier all-rounder in recent times without a glimmer of hope. However, the T20 World Cup marked a turning point, as Pandya rediscovered his form and confidence.""I have been fortunate to play for the country, it was a freak injury I had, I wanted to come back but God had other plans,"" Pandya said, as quoted by PTI, after scoring a 27-ball-50 and taking a wicket in India's 50-run victory over Bangladesh.During a previous World Cup encounter with Bangladesh, Pandya unfortunately suffered an injury that forced him to leave the field. The format of that particular tournament differed from the current one.""I was speaking to our coach Rahul sir (Dravid) and he said 'Luck comes to people who work hard' and that has stuck with me for a long time,"" Pandya, who won the Player of the Match award this day, said.""We have played really good cricket. More than anything we have stuck together and executed our plans.""Pandya's impressive half-century, along with valuable contributions from Virat Kohli , Rishabh Pant, and Shivam Dube, propelled India to a competitive total of 196 for 5 after they were asked to bat first.Kohli scored 37 runs, while Pant and Dube chipped in with 36 and 34 runs respectively, providing solid support to Pandya's innings.At the interval, Pandya expressed confidence in the team's total, stating, He had predicted at the break that it would be enough.""Wicket looked alright, par would've been 180, we got 196. That's a good score here,"" Pandya told broadcasters at the innings break.""At the point Shivam went (in), a couple of wickets were lost. He had to take his time and we did well to recover. His strength is to take down spinners.""When the time came, when we could go hard, we went (after their bowling) after that,"" Pandya said.The star all-rounder held the opinion that as the game wore on, the playing surface would gradually lose its pace.""Definitely it tends to get slower in the end, some balls were sliding down when bowled at the right length, discipline and good bowling should do the job.""At the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, strong crosswinds were prevalent throughout the day. Pandya discussed his strategy of utilizing the wind to his advantage during the match.""I did realise the batters wanted to use the breeze, I made sure I did not give them a chance where the wind was blowing, it was about being one step ahead as a batter.""Pandya acknowledged that the batting unit has areas where they can enhance their performance.""We as a group can get better in a lot of places, losing wickets in bunches is something we can rectify and get better at, apart from that, we are looking good.""Meanwhile, senior off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin expressed his views on the changing perception of batting performances. He emphasized that in the current cricketing landscape, it is crucial for fans to appreciate the value of impactful innings of 20 or 30 runs, rather than solely focusing on milestone scores like half-centuries or centuries.""We are not used to an approach where batsmen throw it away after making 30's 20's, but it is about time we embrace an approach like this especially while batting first.""Top Intent from all the Indian batters so far,"" Ashwin wrote on X about India reaching nearly 200 with just a single half-century and three contributions upwards of 30.","Hardik Pandya scored a 27-ball-50 and took a wicket in India's 50-run victory over Bangladesh.

NEW DELHI: Amidst reports that Babar Azam is preparing to take legal action against YouTubers and former cricketers who have accused him of misconduct during the T20 World Cup , another video is doing the rounds where former cricketer Ahmad Shahzad is criticising the Pakistan cricket captain for the same.During a talk show in Pakistan Shahzad says, ""Former players that he (Babar) is talking about, they should also file a case on him asking when you had a team for 5 years, where have you brought the team, to the 7th spot. Then the 25 crore fans whose sentiments also got hurt, they should also ask what results have you produced.""Shahzad continues, ""The domestic cricketers whom you didn't select for the team, you went ahead with one group, kept on saying that this group will win you matches, but that didn't happen, and those domestic cricketers who didn't get a chance in the past 5 years, they should also file a case and ask questions. They should also ask Babar how you kept adjusting your friends in the team, who you turn into bowlers when they can't bat, turn into batsmen when they can't bowl, and when they do nothing, you adjust them by making them fielders.""Shahzad adds, ""Then you (Babar) should ask that the people who used to criticize you are now in the team, you are their captain, then your sentiments didn't get hurt? Then the selectors who 3 months ago used to say that you don't know captaincy, you are not captaincy material, now you are saying 'yes yes' to them, then your sentiments didn't get hurt? There also you should have filed a case.""Shahzad retorts, ""After losing 3 World Cups, 2 Asia Cups, you (Babar) were made captain again after 2 months, you should have asked the question how you were made the captain? Is it only you whose sentiments are getting hurt, not of the fans? We always tell the public the truth, we don't body shame anyone, we don't even take wrong names, we talk only about cricket,Pakistan cricket. What have you done? You always try to find an escape route.""""Even great players like Messi and Ronaldo , who have a huge fan following, are criticized. Even the effigies of Messi were burnt recently, shoes were hurled at their photos. But they are sportsmen, they take all this in their stride. You should also take the criticism positively, but instead you are saying you will file defamation cases against former cricketers. We were also criticized, so much that we didn't get the third match after two bad matches. We didn't say anything to anyone. You get paid to do well. Even the cameraman here has a job to do, even if he doesn't do it properly, he is also answerable,"" Shahzad concludes.Babar and the Pakistan team faced intense criticism following their disappointing performance in the tournament, which saw them exit during the group stage. This criticism, which targeted Babar in particular, has left the captain disheartened.A report had revealed that a coordinated social media campaign aimed at defaming Babar was launched during the World Cup. The PCB 's legal department is now investigating the defamatory statements made by several YouTubers and former cricketers.Pakistan, who were runners-up in the previous edition of the T20 World Cup, failed to advance beyond the group stage in this year's tournament, prompting a wave of scrutiny and criticism from fans and commentators alike.",Babar Azam is preparing to take legal action against YouTubers and former cricketers who have accused him of misconduct during the T20 World Cup.

India scored 196 for five, thanks to contributions from Virat Kohli , Shivam Dube, and Hardik Pandya. In response, Bangladesh struggled to 146/8 in their 20 overs.Virat Kohli (37 off 28) found some rhythm at the crease before Shivam Dube (34 off 24) and Hardik Pandya (50 not out off 27) pushed India to their highest total at the venue. Pandya provided the final flourish, completing his half-century off the last ball of the innings.India’s bowlers ensured that Bangladesh never posed a serious challenge in the steep run-chase. Kuldeep Yadav (3/19) made the Bangladesh batters look clueless with his mix of googlies and stock deliveries. Jasprit Bumrah (2/13 in four overs) also offered a frugal bowling effort.""Bangladesh skipper Najmul Shanto (40 off 32) played some attacking shots including two sixes over fine leg off Hardik but did not get support from others as the batters let the team down once again.""After Litton Das (13 off 10) pulled Hardik for a six over deep mid-wicket, he was caught at deep square leg the next ball. Litton’s premeditated walk across the stumps led to his dismissal.Kuldeep quickly made an impact by getting rid of opener Tanzid Hasan (29) with a wrong’un, trapping him leg before wicket. Towhid Hridoy, Bangladesh's standout batter so far, went for a sweep against Kuldeep but missed it completely to be adjudged LBW.Bangladesh, at 76 for three in the 12th over, could only delay the inevitable as wickets kept falling.India’s innings was buoyed by a strong start from skipper Rohit Sharma (23 off 11) and Virat Kohli. They allowed themselves to play freely unlike in previous games. Bangladesh's strategy of starting with spinners from both ends against the two right-handers was unusual.Rohit hit three fours and one six before mistiming a shot to be caught. Kohli’s shots included a notable 94m six off Mustafizur Rahman. Kohli also launched leg-spinner Rishad Hossain for a straight six but was later deceived by a slow off-cutter from pacer Tanzim Hasan.Suryakumar Yadav also fell in quick succession, caught after a delivery jumped off the length and kissed his gloves. This left India at 83 for three in 10 overs."" Rishabh Pant (36 off 24) then brought the momentum back in India's favour by collecting two fours and a six over deep midwicket off Mustafizur who had a rare off day.""Pant attacked Rishad Hossain in the next over but was dismissed by the reverse sweep for the second consecutive innings. Dube and Hardik then forged a 53-run stand to propel the innings forward.Hardik’s innings included four boundaries and three sixes. Dube targeted the deep midwicket boundary against spinners and hit Tanzim Hasan for a six down the ground.India's victory against Bangladesh marked their second straight win in the Super 8s. They will face Australia, the only other unbeaten team, in their final Super 8 fixture in St Lucia on Monday.Bangladesh's batting wobbles continued despite their captain’s efforts, making it difficult for them to chase down India’s substantial total. Their inability to support Shanto was evident throughout the innings. After Litton Das’s brief cameo, there was little resistance.Kuldeep Yadav and Hardik Pandya emerged as the heroes for India. Kuldeep’s introduction in the Caribbean leg of the competition has paid off well for the team. Hardik's all-round skills shined through, setting up a competitive total and then contributing with the ball.For India, this win edges them closer to a semifinals spot with a key challenge against Australia forthcoming. Their strategy to utilize both fast bowling and spin showcased a well-rounded and adaptable side.In summary, India’s overall strong performance led by key players secured a significant victory against Bangladesh, moving them a step closer to the semifinals in the T20 World Cup.","India beat Bangladesh by 50 runs in their second Super 8 match of the T20 World Cup.

Buttler, who had to leave IPL 2024 before the playoffs to represent England in a T20I series against Pakistan, expressed his opinion during a press conference ahead of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024.Buttler stated, ""It's my personal opinion that there shouldn't be any international cricket that clashes with the IPL. These games have been in the calendar for a long time, and leading into a World Cup, your No. 1 priority is playing for England and performing for England. I feel like this is the best preparation.""The comments sparked a debate on the Club Prairie Fire podcast, where Hafeez asked Michael Vaughan and Adam Gilchrist for their views. Vaughan supported Buttler's stance, acknowledging the growing significance of the IPL. He remarked, ""I actually agree with him. IPL has become so big, and the players are so well rewarded for participating.""Hafeez interrupted Vaughan by questioning whether it was fair for players to prioritize IPL over national duties. Vaughan responded, ""It is the nature of the beast in 2024. Whether it is absolutely morally right is a very good question. But I think IPL is so big now that it is very hard for international boards to compete with it.""Vaughan also noted the potential impact on the County Championship , with many players likely to miss matches due to IPL commitments. ""Pakistan Super League (PSL) will compete with IPL next year, which will be interesting. It will affect the English summer more than any other country because so many players will be involved in both tournaments,"" the former England skipper added.Adam Gilchrist echoed Vaughan's sentiments, pointing out that domestic cricket will inevitably be compromised due to IPL. He mentioned, ""Domestic cricket is going to be compromised within the more established cricketing nations. For instance, the Sheffield Shield final overlaps with the IPL, so players will have to make a choice.""Hafeez found Buttler's remarks surprising and emphasized the importance of national pride. He commented, ""To me, that was a shocking statement from the captain of England because representing your country is the biggest prize you play for. If you are compromising and saying that national pride should not be there due to the IPL contract, I think that's not right.""","Former Pakistan captain Mohammad Hafeez criticized England skipper Jos Buttler for his recent comments.

Shivam Dube 's place in India's playing eleven at the ongoing T20 World Cup is facing immense scrutiny after the all-rounder's failure to impress with the bat and under-utilization as a bowler, with fans and experts drawing logical conclusions for him to be replaced with either Sanju Samson or Yashasvi Jaiswal .Dube earned a call-up for the T20 World Cup on the back of his fine batting form for the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) during IPL 2024; however, he hasn't yet succeeded in replicating that in this tournament.It was Dube's ability to hit spinners for sixes in the middle overs during the IPL that impressed Rohit Sharma and the BCCI selectors to include him in the 15-member squad, while keeping the likes of Shubman Gill and Rinku Singh among the reserves.But in four innings so far in this World Cup, Dube has scored just 44 runs, with a highest of 31 not out against USA. Add to that Rohit's reluctance in using him as a bowler, and it gives more reasons for him to be replaced.Dube has so far been asked by Rohit to bowl just one over, which he delivered in the match against USA and conceded 11 runs. Interestingly, in IPL 2024 as well he bowled just one over.If India decide to drop him, middle-order batsman Samson fits the bill more than Jaiswal unless Rohit and coach Rahul Dravid decide to bring Kohli back to No. 3 and draft Jaiswal in to open with the skipper.Both Samson and Jaiswal have so far warmed the bench in this T20 World Cup, while the team management decided to push Kohli up a spot to partner Rohit as opener. The move, however, hasn't worked, with Kohli's four innings in the tournament so far reading 1, 4, 0 and 24.""I would love to see Yashasvi Jaiswal getting a look in and opening with Rohit, with Virat at number three,"" said India pacer S Sreesanth on Star Sports.""The player who might miss out will be Shivam Dube. I have been telling this from day one of the World Cup, much before it started, if Dube is not bowling his one or two overs, then either it should be Samson in the middle, who can change the game, or it should be Jaiswal opening the batting and Virat at number three,"" he added.The other thought is that with Bangladesh inclined to us a spin-heavy bowling unit, India might give Dube one more game to show his batting skills; but that line of thought can also be debated because Samson too is a good player against spin.A lot to ponder for Rohit and Dravid.",Shivam Dube's place in India's playing eleven is facing immense scrutiny.

He's got the variety, he got the new ball for the first time (against Afghanistan), because Mohammed Siraj wasn't playing and immediately, second ball, a slower ball to get Gurbaz out.

Georgia struck first with Georges Mikautadze's penalty, but Schick equalized in a match filled with action and drama in Hamburg.Georgia, debutants in the competition, showcased their progress under coach Willy Sagnol , who highlighted his players' disappointment at their opening defeat as a sign of their growth. The Georgian team put in a spirited performance to earn their first Euros point, guided by goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili's exceptional saves.Sagnol said his players' disappointment at their opening defeat showed how far his team has come, and they gave everything in Hamburg to earn their first Euros point.Mamardashvili played a pivotal role, making crucial saves early on, denying efforts from Adam Hlozek and Schick. Georgia's offensive efforts were rewarded just before halftime when Mikautadze converted a penalty, secured after a VAR review flagged a handball by Czech defender Robin Hranac.The game's momentum swung back in favor of the Czechs in the second half. Schick, who had already demonstrated his scoring prowess at Euro 2020, equalized with an improvised finish, chesting home a rebound off the post from Ondrej Lingr's header. This goal marked Schick as the Czech Republic's top scorer in Euros history, surpassing Milan Baros with six goals, but a calf injury forced him to leave the pitch midway through the second half.The Czech team, led by coach Ivan Hasek, had started strong, creating numerous chances. They were initially frustrated when VAR disallowed Hlozek's goal due to a handball, following a save by Mamardashvili that deflected back onto Hlozek’s face and arm. Czech right-back Vladimir Coufal received a booking for a foul on Georgia's standout player Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who along with Mikautadze, had required medical attention before the match but both started.“He attempted to counter and was met with Coufal's challenge, resulting in a yellow card for the Czech defender,” observed reviewers of the game.Georgia also saw their penalty appeals for an incident involving Zuriko Davitashvili and Ladislav Krejci dismissed. Despite these setbacks, Georgia captained by Guram Kashia, managed to test the Czech defense, with Stanec making a brilliant first-half stoppage-time save before conceding the penalty kick.Czech fans experienced further tension as Krejci came close to scoring from another header, narrowly missing the target. The Czechs’ persistence nearly paid off, but they failed to capitalize on several opportunities.In an end-to-end encounter, Georgia showed impressive resolve. “Georgia's fans were in the majority…they began to roar every time Napoli winger Kvaratskhelia got the ball in opposition territory,” noted observers.The match concluded with a dramatic moment when Georgia had a golden opportunity to clinch victory. Substitute Saba Lobjanidze found himself in a prime position but fired over the bar amid a three-on-one break, leaving the match tied.This draw leaves both teams with a challenging road ahead in Euro 2024 Group F. With strong performances from both sides, they will be looking to build on this match in their subsequent fixtures. As the group progresses, the outcome of the upcoming Portugal-Turkey game may further shape their paths."," Patrik Schick's chest-fired goal secured a 1-1 draw for the Czech Republic against Georgia in an engaging Euro 2024 Group F match.

Ralf Rangnick's Austrian side is now in a strong position to qualify for the last 16, needing only to avoid defeat against the Netherlands in their final Group D encounter on Tuesday.Poland's chances of progressing have diminished, as they can no longer secure a top-two finish. Their only hope lies in defeating France and relying on other results to qualify as one of the four best third-placed teams. However, their fate may be sealed before that match if the Netherlands fail to overcome France later on Friday.Austria took a well-deserved early lead through Gernot Trauner's header, but Poland equalized in the 30th minute courtesy of Krzysztof Piatek, who had missed their opening defeat to the Netherlands. Despite Lewandowski's introduction with half an hour remaining, he had little impact as Poland edged closer to elimination. Christoph Baumgartner restored Austria's advantage following a well-worked team move, and Marko Arnautovic sealed the victory with a penalty in the 78th minute.Austria, who reached the knockout stage of a major tournament for the first time since 1954 at Euro 2020, will guarantee their progression with a win against the Netherlands. The Olympiastadion was filled with fans from both countries, with Polish supporters outnumbering their Austrian counterparts.However, it was the Austrian fans who celebrated early on as their team started strongly and took the lead through Trauner's header, aided by Phillipp Mwene's clever wing play. Although Poland grew into the game, they squandered a good chance to equalize when Nicola Zalewski shot over the bar.1.
