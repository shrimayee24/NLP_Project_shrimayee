The match started on a good note with each of the wrestlers showcasing their unique skills over the course of the match.Kairi Sane, another member of the Damage CTRL faction interfered during the match, leaving Dakota Kai in a good position to capitalize on the match. However, Kairi Sane was stopped by WWE Women’s Tag Team champions Alba Fyre and Isla Dawn, who wiped her off her feet outside the ring.The stable had previously attacked the champions during their match against Katana Chance and Kaden Carter last week.

Significance of The Montreal Screwjob in

Bret Hart BLASTS Shawn Michaels Over Scrapped WrestleMania Plans!

Bret Hart On ACCIDENTALLY Disrespecting Shawn Michaels!

Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels are undeniably legends in the world of professional wrestling, each boasting remarkable and storied careers. However, for many fans, their legacies are overshadowed by a single controversial event: the infamous "" Montreal Screwjob ."" This moment from Survivor Series 1997 remains a dark spot in wrestling history, and even now, it’s a subject of much discussion and debate.On the podcast ""Six Feet Under,"" The Undertaker opened up about his feelings regarding this incident. Having witnessed the events unfold firsthand, he shared his sense of regret and disappointment over how the situation played out. ""It's just one of those really unfortunate situations,"" The Undertaker remarked. ""Both Shawn and Bret had incredible, stellar careers. They achieved so much, and yet this one political maneuver is what people often remember. It's great for fans to debate and discuss, but I genuinely feel bad for Shawn and Bret.""The Montreal Screwjob was a pivotal moment where Bret Hart was deceitfully stripped of the WWE Championship by Shawn Michaels, under the orchestration of Vince McMahon. This betrayal left Hart deeply embittered for many years. McMahon later made efforts to reconcile with Hart, starting with a phone call after Hart suffered a stroke and followed by Hart’s induction into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2006. Eventually, Hart and Michaels reconciled when Hart returned to WWE in 2010, setting the stage for a WrestleMania storyline. Hart even managed to make peace with Earl Hebner, the referee who had been involved in the controversial match and aware of the plan.Reflecting on his relationships with both Hart and Michaels, The Undertaker expressed his admiration and affection for the two. ""I'm friends with both Shawn and Bret. I think the world of those guys,"" he said. ""I'm really glad that everyone has moved on to a better place now. But it really sucked that it had to happen in the first place.""Co-host Matt Lyda noted how the ""Montreal Screwjob"" affected Hart’s subsequent tenure in WCW, observing a noticeable lack of enthusiasm in Hart’s performances. The Undertaker concurred, acknowledging the challenges of staying motivated in such circumstances. ""If he doesn’t get hurt, you never know what could have happened,"" The Undertaker mused. ""But when your heart's not in it, it’s tough. It’s really tough, man.""In the end, while the Montreal Screwjob remains a heavily debated topic among wrestling fans, it’s clear that for those involved, it’s a painful memory of what could have been. The Undertaker’s reflections underscore the emotional toll such events can take on the wrestlers, despite their many achievements and contributions to the sport.","Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels are undeniably legends in the world of professional wrestling.

The WWE Money in the Bank 2024 is almost here, and the upcoming PLE has some amazing match cards. The last few weeks of Raw and Smackdown zeroed in on all the contenders who will be participating at the mega show in Toronto. Not only is the current match-card exciting, but it could witness some of the most unpredictable finishes.Here are all the matches that are going to take place on Saturday in Toronto.If this match happened before what The Bloodline did with Paul Heyman, Cody Rhodes and company would have been the likely winners. However, the new members of The Bloodline are on the rise, and nothing but a victory will help Sikoa establish himself as the true leader. Whether The Rock and Roman Reigns return remains to be seen, but this match could be the first step of The Bloodline establishing themselves as a dominant force.Damian Priest has defended the World Heavyweight Championship well, but Seth Rollins has a different personality. The gentleman’s agreement makes things a bit more interesting. While Rollins could be the winner of the match (which means Priest will have to leave Judgement Day), he might not immediately get the title. In fact, a triple threat showdown could be set up for Summerslam 2024, where the duo faces the Ring General Gunther.Bron Breakker’s ascent in Raw has been rapid, to say the least, which is exactly why he might not win the title. Sami Zayn has won championships and fights where he has been the underdog, and Breakker loves to dominate his matches. While Zayn might turn out to be the winner in this championship fight, Breakker could establish himself as a strong threat to the entire RAW roster.Drew McIntyre is a strong contender to win, but a heel getting hold of the MITB might not be on the cards. Additionally, it looks almost certain that CM Punk will have some interference as he did in Scotland. In that case, Jey Uso appearsis the most obvious winner, as the MITB contract will allow him to push for any title he wants. However, Carmelo Hayes has received a lot of push from Triple H, and it won’t be surprising if the former NXT star manages to get an unexpected win.Unlike the men’s match, the women’s showdown has fewer legitimate contenders, and Tiffany appears to be the favorite. Like Hayes, Stratton has been receiving a strong push, and she becomes a great contender for a future title run by securing the MITB contract. However, Zoey Stark might also be a contender for the win if the creative division decides to give her the much-deserved push.","The WWE Money in the Bank 2024 is almost here, and the upcoming PLE has some amazing match cards.

This story is a touching one and represents what can aptly be described as the Circle of life, where a son is fulfilling the dream of what his father once had, quite similar to what you get to see in the Lion King.While talking on The Pivot Podcast later on, here’s what Cody had to say:“""Truthfully at eight years old that was my goal, my goal was to do what I did last night and you know I wish he had been alive for it ... I often get emotional on the microphone, there's a good chunk of wrestling fans, that is not what they are tuning in for.

Zimbabwe:

NEW DELHI: When the Indian T20 team takes on Zimbabwe in a five-match series that begins in Harare on Saturday, they will be going on a voyage of self-discovery without their regular talismans, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, in an attempt to uncover their future treasures.Shubman Gill , a reserve on the T20 World Cup team, and a number of IPL players will press the refresh button even as the excitement of winning the T20 World Cup spreads around India.During the series, which is totally slated to be played in Zimbabwe's capital, all of the newcomers are anticipated to make their international debut.Two youngsters who could make their debuts are Riyan Parag , a young Assamese player who has shown much of potential as a T20 hitter, and Punjab's Abhishek Sharma , who had an amazing IPL season with Sunrisers Hyderabad. They both meet every requirement for this format.Even both Rohit and Kohli have missed a number of bilateral series in the last few years, particularly in the shortest format, their official departure from the format will undoubtedly be felt more keenly.It will be difficult to match the abilities and qualities that the two contemporary greats brought to the table, but as is the way of things, the old guard must give way to the new one.Zimbabwe isn't the strongest opponent by any means, but in the Twenty20 format, the difference between the two teams isn't as great as it is in the other two formats.The hosts, led by the fearless Sikandar Raza , a former IPL player for the Punjab Kings, could be quite the force on windy days at the Harare Sports Club, where the ball will jiggle around as the afternoon progresses.These youngsters will remain in the running when the world champion team's first team members return to national service thanks to a few strong performances in this series.From the third match onwards, Shivam Dube, Sanju Samson, and Yashasvi Jaiswal will be available; some of the young men will only have a few games to demonstrate their abilities.There won't be many openings in the starting eleven as players like Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Rishabh Pant, Axar Patel, Hardik Pandya , and Suryakumar Yadav, who is expected to be his deputy, return to T20Is in the future. In the shortest format, the national team will play 34 games from now until the 2026 T20 World Cup in India.Although captain Gill is anticipated to open, it remains to be seen if his closest friend Abhishek earns his first India cap or if seasoned CSK captain and captain of the squad that won gold at the Asian Games, Ruturaj Gaikwad, is selected.Gaikwad might bat third or switch places with the Punjab southpaw if Abhishek begins. Compared to Abhishek, Parag has a better chance of making his debut because he can bat at No. 4, a position he has carved out for the Royals.In this new look lineup, Rinku Singh-the Indian T20 team's designated finisher for years to come-is projected to bat at No. 5, with Dhruv Jurel or Jitesh Sharma batting at No. 6 and wearing the huge gloves.Based on the selection pattern, Jurel started this series as the backup keeper behind Sanju Samson, but Jitesh was a late addition due to the World Cup squad players' unavailability.As a result, Jurel, who had a strong Test debut against England, would probably start the first two matches before Samson gets there.A highly consistent death bowler, Mukesh Kumar, might be the third seamer to surpass Harshit Rana, who is a superior slogger with the willow, in the bowling department. Avesh Khan and Khaleel Ahmed are the two standbys during the T20 World Cup.With his versatility, Washington Sundar will keep his position until Dube gets there, while leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi is anticipated to participate in every match.Shubman Gill (c), Ruturaj Gaikwad, Abhishek Sharma, Rinku Singh, Dhruv Jurel (wk), Riyan Parag, Washington Sundar, Ravi Bishnoi, Avesh Khan, Khaleel Ahmed, Mukesh Kumar, Tushar Deshpande, Sai Sudharsan, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Harshit RanaSikandar Raza (captain), Faraz Akram, Brian Bennett, Johnathan Campbell, Tendai Chatara, Luke Jongwe, Innocent Kaia, Clive Madande, Wessly Madhevere, Tadiwanashe Marumani, Wellington Masakadza, Brandon Mavuta, Blessing Muzarabani, Dion Myers, Antum Naqvi, Richard Ngarava, Milton Shumba",The Indian T20 team takes on Zimbabwe in a five-match series that begins in Harare on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Star India batter Virat Kohli had a torrid run throughout the T20 World Cup , scoring 5 single digit scores. But in the final against South Africa in Barbados, the veteran rose to the occasion in style, scoring a superb knock that helped India win the title.When the chips were down and India were reeling early, Kohli hit a perfect 76-run knock to take India to a solid total.The bowlers then successfully defended the total in a thrilling finale as India ended an over-a-decade long ICC title drought.After clinching the T20 World Cup title, the team on Thursday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi , where he asked Kohli about his see-saw journey at the World Cup.Taking the PM through his title journey, Kohli admitted that he was not confident while batting throughout the World Cup but surrendered himself to the situation in the final.""I will always cherish that day (of the final). Throughout the tournament, I was not able to make the contributions that I wanted to make. At one time, I told Rahul bhai, 'I haven't done justice to myself and the team till now'. He said, 'when the situation will arise, I trust that you will perform', Kohli said.""The way my tournament was going, I didn't have that much confidence when I was going in to play. Had doubts whether I would be able to perform the way I wanted. When we went in to play (in the final), and when I got three boundaries in first 4 balls, I told Rohit, 'what a game this is. One day you feel you won't be able to score a single run, and the other day, everything falls into place and good things happen'.""When wickets fell early, I understood that I had to surrender to the situation, for the team. The only thing I was focussing on was what's necessary for the team. I felt, I was pushed into that zone. I was into that moment.Later I realised that whatever is supposed to happen, it happens. It was bound to happen to me and to the team (title win). From the situation we won the final, we lived each and every single delivery towards the end. From the point where the final turned around. What was going through us, we cannot explain,"" Kohli said.The PM hosted the T20 World Cup-winning Indian cricket team for breakfast during which, he said, there were 'memorable' conversations on the side's experiences through the marquee event co-hosted by USA and the West Indies.The Rohit-led squad, that won the title after defeating South Africa by seven runs in the final last week, arrived in Delhi early Thursday morning after being stranded in Bridgetown, Barbados for five days due to a category 4 hurricane.The PM was flanked by Rohit and outgoing head coach Rahul Dravid in the group picture.Several players later shared photos with the PM.","Virat Kohli had a torrid run throughout the T20 World Cup, scoring 5 single digit scores.

The game ended 0-0 after 120 minutes, with France prevailing 5-3 in the shoot-out. This match is likely to be remembered as Cristiano Ronaldo 's final appearance in the tournament.France converted all their penalties, setting up a semi-final clash with Spain.Portugal's Joao Felix was the only player to miss, hitting the post with his team's third attempt.The shoot-out triumph was a welcome change for France, who had previously suffered penalty heartbreaks in major tournaments. They lost the 2022 World Cup final to Argentina and were eliminated from the last Euros by Switzerland in the round of 16, both via penalties. Additionally, they were defeated by Italy in the 2006 World Cup final, which was also held in Germany.Kylian Mbappe, who had missed the decisive penalty against Switzerland, was substituted by Bradley Barcola during extra time and did not participate in the shoot-out. Barcola, along with Ousmane Dembele, Youssouf Fofana, and Jules Kounde, successfully converted their spot-kicks for France.""I am proud of my players. Even if we are not doing everything perfectly we don't give up,"" said France coach Didier Deschamps.""Once again we are in the semi-finals. I will savour this a little even if we have another game coming up.""Mbappe struggled to find his rhythm throughout the match, as he continues to adapt to playing with a protective mask covering his recently fractured nose, an injury sustained during France's initial encounter against Austria.Despite the setback, the young forward will have another opportunity to showcase his talents in the upcoming semi-final. On the other hand, Ronaldo, at the age of 39, seems to have made his final appearance in the European Championship.This tournament marked Ronaldo's sixth European Championship, but he was unable to contribute to his record-breaking tally of 14 goals in the competition, having failed to find the back of the net in all five of Portugal's matches in Germany.Although Ronaldo successfully converted his penalty, which was Portugal's first, Roberto Martinez's squad has been eliminated after failing to score in over six hours of play. They advanced to the quarter-finals by defeating Slovenia on penalties following a goalless draw in the round of 16, but this time, they fell short in what turned out to be a lackluster match in Hamburg.""In the same way that it was maybe cruel for Slovenia in the last 16, today it was cruel for us. That's football ,"" Bernardo Silva told CNN.France and Portugal, both underperforming in the tournament, faced off in a match that lacked intensity but had moments of excitement in the second half.Portugal started to threaten with midfield runners getting into the box, as Bruno Fernandes and Vitinha tested Mike Maignan, who was determined to maintain his clean sheet in open play. Ronaldo nearly scored from close range, but Maignan reacted quickly to deny him.France countered with Kolo Muani and Kounde combining, but Ruben Dias made a crucial interception.Deschamps brought on Dembele, who immediately set up a golden opportunity for Camavinga, which the midfielder missed. The game drifted towards extra time, where Ronaldo missed a good chance from Francisco Conceicao's cutback.Mbappe, France's captain, watched the end of extra time from the bench as Maignan denied Nuno Mendes at the very end of 120 minutes, leading to a penalty shoot-out.The shoot-out took place at the Portugal end of the Volksparkstadion, with Maignan not making any saves but not needing to. Despite Diogo Costa's heroics in the previous round, saving three Slovenia penalties, he could not stop any this time.","France beat Portugal 5-3 on penalties in Euro 2024 quarter-final match.

The bowlers then produced an all-ound effort in the Proteas win.South Africa's innings was kickstarted by a solid partnership between Brits and skipper Wolvaardt.Brits scored an impressive 81 off 56 balls, hitting 10 fours and three sixes. Kapp contributed significantly with a rapid 57 off 33 balls. Despite a cautious start, they reached 50 in 43 balls.India's poor fielding contributed to their woes as Wolvaardt, Kapp, and Brits were all dropped at various stages of the innings.Brits and Kapp’s partnership, alongside India's missed fielding opportunities, propelled South Africa to post their highest total in T20Is against India. Wolvaardt was dropped in the 4th over, Kapp in the 10th, and Brits in the 16th over.The lack of bounce on the pitch allowed the South African batters to utilize sweep shots effectively.In response, the Indian openers got off to a strong start. Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana built a 56-run stand in just 32 balls, with Verma scoring 18 off 14 balls before falling to Ayabonga Khaka in the sixth over.Mandhana continued to anchor the innings, scoring 46 off 30 balls. She was later joined by Dayalan Hemalatha, who scored 14 off 17 balls.Together, they put on a 31-run partnership before Mandhana was dismissed by Chloe Tryon in the 10th over, leaving India at 87 for three.Hemalatha was cleaned up by Nadine de Klerk in the following over. Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues then took the attacking route, putting up a 50-run stand in 38 deliveries, reducing the equation to 47 runs needed off 18 balls. Rodrigues showcased a brilliant performance, bringing up her 11th T20I half-century in just 29 deliveries.India needed 21 runs off the final six balls, but Nonkululeko Mlaba bowled a tight over, conceding only eight runs to seal the victory for South Africa.There were some injury concerns during the match as well. Richa Ghosh was replaced by S Sajana as a concussion substitute after Ghosh fell face first while attempting to take a catch. Brits was also stretchered off the ground with severe cramps.India's bowlers Pooja and Radha did manage to take two wickets each, with Pooja maintaining decent economy.However, their efforts were overshadowed by their team's fielding lapses and the resilient batting display by South Africa.India's fightback was commendable, yet South Africa's overall stronger execution and India's fielding errors ultimately determined the outcome of the match.","South Africa women beat India by 12 runs in opening T20I in Chennai.

Their recent experiences, Krunal said, felt like a 'fairy tale'.""It's almost been a decade since Hardik and I started playing professional cricket. And the last few days have been like a fairy tale that we've dreamt off,"" Krunal wrote in a long emotional post in his Instagram handle.""Like every countryman I've lived this through our teams' heroics and I couldn't be more emotional with my brother being at the heart of it.""Krunal reminisced about the challenges Hardik faced in the past year, particularly during the IPL 2024 season.Hardik’s surprising return to Mumbai Indians as captain after two years with Gujarat Titans was met with criticism, especially as the team finished at the bottom for only the second time in 17 editions.""The last six months have been the toughest for Hardik. He simply didn't deserve what he went through, and as a brother, I felt very, very bad for him.""From booing, to people saying all kinds of nasty things, at the end of the day, we all forgot that he is just a human being who also has emotions,"" Krunal added.An injury had cut short Hardik's ODI World Cup campaign in November 2023 and his struggle during the IPL season added to his difficulties.Despite the challenges, Hardik's pivotal performance during the T20 World Cup in the USA and West Indies showcased his resilience, especially in crucial games including the final.""He somehow passed through all of this with a smile, though I know how hard it was for him to put on a smile. He kept working hard and focusing on what he needed to do to get the World Cup since that was his ultimate objective.""He has now played his heart out to realise India's long standing dream - And nothing has ever meant to him more. From the age of 6 - It's playing for the country and winning the World Cup that's been the dream.In the final, Hardik’s performance was instrumental. He took key wickets, including that of Heinrich Klaasen, and successfully defended 16 runs in the last over to lead India to victory by seven runs.Throughout the tournament, he scored 144 runs at a strike rate of 151.57 across six innings and claimed 11 wickets.""I just want to remind people that what Hardik has done in such a short span in his career is unbelievable. His efforts for the national team have never been compromised. Every time, at every stage of Hardik's life, people have written him off, and that has only motivated him to come back even stronger.""For Hardik, it has always been country first, and it will always be that way. For a young boy coming from Baroda, there can be no bigger achievement than helping his team win the World Cup.""Hardik, I am so, so proud of you. I love you so much, and you deserve every bit of happiness and all the good things that are coming your way.""I have immense respect for you, my bachhu,"" Krual signed off.",Krunal Pandya praises brother Hardik's comeback during India's T20 World Cup win.

But what Virat Bhai and Rohit Bhai have achieved, if I look to achieve that or reach that, it will be very difficult for me.""Every player has his own goal, where he wants to reach.

Is cricket, and T20 cricket in particular, gaining popularity in the US?

How do you measure the T20 World Cup success in the US as co-hosts?

How does cricket fit into the business landscape in the USA?

What is the interest of advertisers in a country where NBA, NFL and MLB rule?

What motivated Infinite Solutions to invest in a cricket team?

The ICC has granted MLC List-A status. What are your thoughts on this?

Your thoughts on USA's cricket sensation Saurabh Netravalkar, who left an impact on the T20 World Cup...

With cricket set to be part of the Olympics in LA 2028, how significant will that be for the sport in the US?

NEW DELHI: Washington Freedom reached the Eliminator of the Major League Cricket ( MLC ) last season but lost to MI New York (MINY). However, team owner Sanjay Govil is confident that new captain Steve Smith will lead the team to glory in the second edition of the tournament beginning July 5, while expressing optimism about their chances of success this time around.Washington will begin their campaign against MINY on Saturday, July 6, at Church Street Park in Morrisville.Govil, who is also the founder and chairman of Infinite Computer Solutions, spoke to TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview about the Washington Freedom team, captain Smith, pace sensation Saurabh Netravalkar, cricket in the USA and much more.We are part of the six teams in the MLC. The concept of MLC was actually started by Satyan Gajwani, Vice Chairman of the Times Internet, and the former founders of Willow. They got it going, and now six teams are part of it. We own the Washington Freedom team, based in the US capital. We are very excited about our second season and feel that we have a great team. We have Ricky Ponting as our coach and Steve Smith as our captain. Our roster includes both international and domestic players.The format allows six international players and five domestic players. We have notable international players like Travis Head, Rachin Ravindra, Glenn Maxwell, and, as mentioned, Steve Smith. Our bowling lineup includes Marco Janssen, Lockie Ferguson and others. On the domestic side, we have Saurabh Netravalkar, who has become a sensation (through his T20 World Cup heroics for USA) and Andre Gaus. We also have Amila Aponso from Sri Lanka.We have a very competitive team, which was our goal. All teams in the MLC are highly competitive, and our objective was to ensure we put out a product that is meaningful and competitive, not overshadowed by the IPL teams. Last year, we made it to the playoffs, and this year we're taking it one game at a time with the same goal in mind.Absolutely, it is becoming big. A recent CBS news story showed that over 35 million people are watching cricket in the US, making it the fifth largest cricket media market for the ICC. The India-Pakistan match held in New York, along with other matches in New York, Dallas and Florida, has significantly increased awareness...the overall impact has been substantial.USA's win against Pakistan was a watershed moment for USA Cricket , generating a tremendous amount of awareness, publicity and coverage. I equate that to the US victory over Russia in ice hockey during the Olympics. Suddenly, people are taking notice. The US has a huge appetite for sports. Despite having the NFL, NBA, NHL and many other leagues, there is always a demand for more sports because they serve as great unifiers and promote team building.India's recent win in the T20 World Cup is a perfect example of teamwork, with every player contributing to the victory. If any one player had not contributed, it could have led to a loss. This aspect of cricket, where everyone has specialized roles and works together like a well-oiled machine, is truly remarkable.I think it was very successful. I wish the stadium they built (in Nassau County) had survived because it would have been a great opportunity for young kids to grow up and play cricket there for generations to come. There are so many academies, and it would have been wonderful to see the stadium where the first India-Pakistan match in America was held. Nonetheless, it was a great opportunity to showcase cricket.Leading into MLC and the Olympics in 2028, we have some really exciting developments happening. I would love to see a Women's World Cup in the US at some point soon. We are building stadiums across the country, which we desperately need to propel the sport further. We are well on the path to achieving that. In every city, you can see the progress cricket lovers have made in terms of having fields customized for cricket. This (cricket) is now becoming, I wouldn't say mainstream, but it's getting there.So, the good news is that everyone involved in the sport is willing to invest in the business. I always believe that passion is the most important thing. If you have passion, everything else follows. If you start a business with the sole intent of making money, you will never succeed, in my opinion. Every idea has a passion behind it. You execute that idea, and business and profits follow. That's what every owner is doing; they are all willing to make the investment and have been making investments. In MLC, we see a very promising path to success over the next few years.We have already started to get good sponsors. Advertisers are great. For example, we have Verizon as our sponsor, which is one of the biggest brands in America. I know other teams also have very good sponsors. So the interest is definitely picking up more and more from an advertising perspective. Advertising dollars are invested to target a certain audience, and as we become more mainstream and reach beyond the diaspora from cricket-loving countries, we (will) start seeing more and more advertising dollars flow in.If there are 40 million people who watch cricket, that's a very significant segment of the US population. Moreover, this segment of the population is not just large, but also very successful. They are among the highest taxpayers in the country, making their economic impact substantial. We only see this growing.When I look at other sports leagues like football and the NHL, I don't have the exact numbers for how many people follow those sports, but it's not the entire US population. Whether it's 40 million, 50 million, or 60 million, I don't have that data. However, 40 million people is not a bad start for any sport.It was more luck and opportunity that led to this. For the record, Infinite Solutions does not own the cricket team; they are two separate, independent entities. Infinite Solutions is a sponsor of the cricket team. It's the passion that drives us. We all grew up watching and playing cricket.I grew up in Delhi, where my father was a professor at IIT Delhi, so I spent my childhood on the campus. We didn't have a lot of money, but we had all the facilities to play sports. Inside the IIT campus, there were tennis courts, cricket fields, swimming pools and badminton courts. We were exposed to every sport, but cricket was always at the top.Thanks for bringing that up. The T20 World Cup, the List-A status and the Olympics all show the ICC's commitment to the USA as a market and as a future cricketing powerhouse. We are very grateful for that. Having List-A status motivates players to perform at their best regardless. They are professionals. Even last year, they gave their all, playing in this heat and all the challenges. It's extra motivation knowing that their statistics count towards their international numbers, which is great.He is a once-in-a-generation kind of individual. He is part of the Washington Freedom team and played Under-19 cricket for India alongside players like KL Rahul. At one point, he decided, for good reasons, to step away from cricket and pursue academics. He attended Cornell University, an Ivy League school, where he completed his master's degree. He then moved to Silicon Valley to work in technology before rediscovering his passion for cricket and excelling in it. He even dismissed Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma with his bowling skills.Aside from cricket, he is also a superb musician. We recognized his talent before he gained widespread recognition, and we have a special fondness for him because he is such a genuinely nice person. His wife is equally kind-hearted. Despite achieving great success in the World Cup and reaching the peak of his career, whenever I called to congratulate him, he always answered the phone and spoke to me. He is a superb team member—calm, composed, humble, and grounded. He exemplifies kindness and is a multi-talented individual.Huge! I think there's going to be a lot of impetus now for dollars coming in to promote cricket in the US. The US wants to excel in every sport it plays, and there's already so much infrastructure built here in terms of academies, etc. For example, in our team, we have a player who was born in the US and was a reserve for the US national team. That by itself is a significant statement. We're going to see more and more of such developments.There's a lot of interest because these kids have grown up watching their parents play cricket and watching cricket matches at 3 a.m. It's already ingrained in their muscle memory. They see a future in cricket where they have a chance to become the next Virat Kohli or Rohit Sharma, and there are many avenues for them -- playing in the IPL, MLC, other leagues, representing the USA team and securing big sponsorships. There's a clear path now, and we're very grateful to the ICC, the Times Group, and everyone else involved for their support.","Washington Freedom reached Eliminator of Major League Cricket last season but lost to MI New York.

NEW DELHI: Portugal and France are set to clash in the European Championship quarterfinals on Friday, with the match featuring a showdown between soccer superstars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappé . The victor will advance to the semi-finals, facing either Spain or tournament host Germany . The game is scheduled to kick off at 9 p.m. local time (1900 GMT) in Hamburg.Despite being pre-tournament favourites, both teams have struggled to impress. Portugal has failed to score in its last two matches, losing 2-0 to Georgia and drawing 0-0 with Slovenia before prevailing in a penalty shootout. Similarly, no French player has scored from open play at Euro 2024 , with their goals coming from two own-goals and a penalty by Mbappé.Ronaldo, appearing in his record sixth European Championship, broke down in tears after missing a penalty in extra time against Slovenia. At 39 years old, he has yet to score in the tournament, but if he does, he would become the oldest goal scorer in the competition's history. Meanwhile, Mbappé will continue to wear a protective mask due to a broken nose sustained in France's group opener against Austria. Coach Didier Deschamps suggested that Mbappé might need to wear the mask for months.The match holds historical significance, taking place exactly 18 years after the nations' meeting in the 2006 World Cup semifinals, where Zinedine Zidane scored the winning penalty. Ronaldo played the entire match, while the player of the match was Lilian Thuram, whose son, Marcus, is expected to feature for France in Hamburg.France will be without suspended midfielder Adrien Rabiot, likely prompting Antoine Griezmann to drop back into central midfield, with Ousmane Dembele potentially joining the forward line. Portugal coach Roberto Martinez has a full squad available, with no suspensions or injuries. Both Mbappé and Ronaldo, along with several of their teammates, risk missing the semifinals if they receive another booking.France has been defensively solid, conceding only one goal at Euro 2024 – a retaken penalty by Poland's Robert Lewandowski. Mbappé, at 25 years old, has scored 48 goals for France, while Ronaldo holds the men's record with 130 international goals.This marks the teams' third consecutive meeting at a European Championship, with a 2-2 draw in the group stage in 2021 (Ronaldo scored two penalties) and Portugal's 1-0 victory in the 2016 final.Ronaldo, set to make a record 212th appearance for Portugal, has taken 20 shots without scoring at Euro 2024.The UEFA European Championship 2024 quaterfinals between Portugal and France is set for July 5, Friday.The UEFA Euro 2024 fixture will be held at Stuttgart Arena in Stuttgart, Germany.

Enrico & Federico Chiesa

Gheorghe & Ianis Hagi

Lillian Thuram is a former French defender who won the 1998 World Cup and also the 2000 Euro. He scored 2 goals in the 1998 semifinal against Croatia. Marcus Thuram, who is leading the line with France captain Kylian Mbappe , is still a work in progress.""I'm proud to wear the Thuram name on my back,"" said Marcus.Francisco Conceicao has already shown glimpses of his lineage when he scored a last-minute goal against Czech Republic and helped Portugal win the game. Old-timers watching the youngster were reminded of a similar looking right winger who was part of Portugal's Golden Generation. Sergio Conceicao, Francisco's father, even has a Euro hat-trick against his name vs Germany in the 2000 edition.In true Dutch and Ajax tradition, Daley Blind is a true disciple of Total Football just as his father Danny was. A long-serving Ajax faithful, Danny was the defensive anchor in a terrific Dutch and Ajaz generation of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Son Daley is an equally unflappable presence in the heart of the Dutch midfield.Enrico Chiesa was a former striker in the 1990s for a team that was always more famous for its defenders. Enrico made his presence felt at Euro 96 with his runs with Pierluigi Casiraghi before fizzling out. With Federico spearheading Italy's title charge at the last Euro, you could say the son has already surpassed his dad's legacy. This time, an unimaginative Italy gave way to Switzerland in the Round of 16.For Kasper Schmeichel, Denmark captain, it was his third Euro. A top keeper, Kasper is yet to reach the heights that his father Peter did with Denmark in 1992 when they won the Euro.Ianis Hagi, the Romanian midfielder, is the son of the great Gheorghe Hagi. The Maradona of the Carpathians as Hagi Sr is called is inarguably Romania's greatest. Ianis has shown similar flashes of intelligence and skill that made his father so famous, though even he knows he has huge, huge boots to fill.","Lillian Thuram is a former French defender who won the 1998 World Cup and also the 2000 Euro.

Argentina gradually gained control and took the lead through Lisandro Martinez 's powerful header from a Messi corner.Ecuador's determination was rewarded in stoppage time when Kevin Rodriguez's glancing header forced the match into a penalty shootout. Despite Messi's uncharacteristic miss, Martinez's brilliance between the posts proved decisive, as he denied Angel Mena and Alan Minda with superb diving saves.Martinez's heroics in high-pressure situations have become a hallmark of his performances for Argentina. His penalty shootout heroics in the 2021 Copa America semi-final against Colombia and the 2022 World Cup final against France cemented his reputation as a formidable presence in such situations.Ecuador's performance, however, deserves praise. Felix Sanchez's team displayed tactical discipline and created enough chances to have won the game in regulation time.
