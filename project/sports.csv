Washington Sundar: 'Nitish Reddy is fire, not flower; he killed it today'

NEW DELHI: Australia captain Pat Cummins was left perplexed after the third umpire overturned what appeared to be a legitimate dismissal on day four of the Boxing Day Test at the MCG.While attempting to wrap up India’s first innings, Cummins delivered a full-length delivery to Mohammed Siraj , which seemed to produce an edge caught by Steve Smith at second slip.The Australians celebrated, but on-field umpire Michael Gough referred the decision to third umpire Sharfuddoula Saikat to confirm whether it was a bump ball.Third umpire Sharfuddoula ruled Siraj not out, stating, ""I can see the ball after hitting the back, I am satisfied.""The decision left Cummins and his team visibly confused.Cummins approached on-field umpire Gough to request another review of the footage, but both Gough and fellow umpire Joel Wilson declined his appeal, allowing Siraj to continue batting.The decision also left former cricketers Adam Gilchirst and Ravi Shastri confused.""This is very interesting. I have never seen this before. He is saying, 'You, as umpires, took it upstairs on your own behalf, but I want to review the decision.' I do think it needs to be looked at very closely,"" Gilchrist said on air.""The umpire said I've seen the ball bounce after it hit the bat. That was a very quick call, a very quick call, just two replays,"" Shastri said.The controversial call ultimately had little impact, as Australian offspinner Nathan Lyon dismissed centurion Nitish Kumar Reddy shortly afterward for 114.India’s innings ended at 369 in 119.3 overs, trailing Australia’s first-innings total by 105 runs.The five-match series is currently locked at 1-1.India secured a commanding 295-run win in Perth, while Australia responded with a 10-wicket triumph in pink-ball Test in Adelaide.The rain-hit third Test at the Gabba in Brisbane ended in a draw, setting the stage for a high-stakes battle in Melbourne.",Third umpire overturns what appeared to be a legitimate dismissal on day four of the Boxing Day Test at the MCG.

MAVERICKS at SUNS | FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS | December 27, 2024

When and where to watch the Phoenix Suns vs Golden State Warriors game tonight (December 28, 2024)?

Phoenix Suns star, Devin Booker has once again been ruled out of his team’s upcoming game against the Golden State Warriors . Booker has missed the Suns’ last four games, out of which they have only managed to win one against the Denver Nuggets. Booker will again be on the sidelines as he is still struggling with a left groin strain that is expected to keep him out for a while more.Here’s what Mike Budenholzer had to say about Booker’s progress, “He's making good progress. We feel good about it. He's still got a little more to go, but he's progressing as expected.” When speaking about Grayson Allen, Budenholzer simply said that he is recovering well and will be evaluated in 24 hours.Missing two guards like Devin Booker and Grayson Allen doesn’t bode well for the Suns. Especially, since they heavily rely on play calls for a good part of their offense. Moreover, Booker is instrumental to the team’s offense as he averages 25.1 points, 3.7, and 6.4 assists for his team.However, Kevin Durant has picked up a big chunk of the attack in Booker’s absence. Over the last four games, KD has averaged 32 points a night. If it wasn’t for him, the Suns would’ve undoubtedly lost all four games they’ve played without Booker. However, the Slim Reaper is 36 years old and has lost a step over the past few years.Durant will not be able to lift the Suns alone, even though he scored 35 against the Mavericks, it wasn’t enough to pull off a victory. So Phoenix will be hoping that Booker returns to the lineup soon. Without him, the entire ship falls apart, and the longer he stays out, the worse their chances of making the playoffs this year.Apart from Durant and Booker, what is also important for the Suns is to sign a solid defender who can score 15+ points on a nightly basis. Hopefully, the Suns will be able to make some moves before the trade deadline. With another solid piece on the board, the Suns might end up surprising the league this season.ALSO READ: Golden State Warriors vs Phoenix Suns (12/28): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, Game Prediction, Betting Tips, How to Watch, and More The Phoenix Suns will be traveling to the Chase Center to take on the Golden State Warriors at 8:30 PM ET on Saturday, December 28, 2024.

More Than $15,000 Fine To Two Los Angeles Chargers Players, But Chargers’ Head Coach Receives A Bonus Of $1 Million

Jim Harbaugh Locker Room Victory Speech After Chargers Clinch Playoff Berth | LA Chargers



Violations and fines in general

Violations in the Denver Broncos and Los Angeles Chargers match

First violation:

Second violation:

Jim Harbaugh’s $1 million emolument

To the unversed, NFL players are usually paid more than NFL head coaches. Some of the highest-paid NFL players are Dak Prescott, Jared Goff, Jordan Love, and Patrick Mahomes. Dak Prescott, quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys, is remunerated $86 million. Jared Goff, quarterback of the Detroit Lions, is salaried $81 million. Jordan Love of the Green Bay Packers is compensated $79 million. And Patrick Mahomes, quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs, is rewarded $46 million.However, there are some highest-paid head coaches too. In 2023, Bill Belichick, the head coach of the New England Patriots, was the highest-drawing head coach with an annual salary of about $25 million. In 2024, Andy Reid, the head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs, was the highest-paid head coach, with yearly earnings of about $20 million. In fact, a survey conducted in 2023 declared that NFL head coaches constitute about 70% of the total highest-drawing head coaches. That was salary. Now, comes the fine.What happened with the Los Angeles Chargers shocked everyone. The players of the Chargers team, precisely, two of them, were charged with hefty fines of $6700 and $8200, respectively, whereas the head coach of the same team received a bonus of $1 million. Let’s dig deeper.Depending on the violation, an NFL player or the head coach is fined. For verbal or other non-physical offenses, a fine of $31,000 is charged for the first offense; the second offense is double ($63,000). For physical offenses like striking, kicking, or kneeing, the fine is $11,000 for the first offense and $17,000 for the second one. For a horse collar tackle, the fine is $16,000 for the first offense and $22,000 for the second one. For unsportsmanlike conduct, the fine is $14,000 for the first offense and $19,000 for the second one. For uniform-related offenses, the fine can vary between $5,000 and $11,000 for the first offense and $11,000 to $22,000 for the second offense.At 7:58 in the first quarter of the NFL match, when Denver Broncos running back Blake Watson came charging forward, Los Angeles Chargers free safety Tony Jefferson came forward towards RB Watson and pushed him out of the sidelines with his helmet. Referees charged him with a 3-yard penalty for unnecessary roughness, and the NFL fined him $6722. Head coach Jim Harbaugh had signed Chargers FS Tony Jefferson.In the second quarter, the Denver Broncos were leading with a score of 21-13. And, the Los Angeles Chargers wanted to defeat them. At 11:33 in the third quarter, Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix made a 5-yard pass to tight end Nate Adkins. As a result, Los Angeles safety Derwin James Jr. tried to tackle TE Adkins. But Adkins handled him and galloped ahead. But Los Angeles linebacker Tuli Tuipulotu was waiting for TE Adkins. LB Tuipulotu tackled TE Adkins by using his helmet. The referees did not give him any penalty, but nothing goes past the NFL. The NFL fined Los Angeles linebacker Tuli Tuipulotu $8297 for using unnecessary roughness during the tackle. Head coach Jim Harbaugh had signed Chargers LB Tuli Tuipulotu, too.Despite all the hefty fines on the Los Angeles Chargers players, the team has had 10 wins and 6 losses till week 17. They have secured a spot in the playoffs. And so the team would like to extend its gratitude to the head coach, Jim Harbaugh, with a paycheck of $1 million. The terms of his contract read, “By clinching a wild-card spot today, Chargers HC Jim Harbaugh collects a $1 million playoff bonus in his contract.” Harbaugh had signed a deal with the Los Angeles Chargers only this January.Also Read : Rams QB Matthew Stafford Drops Truth Bombs After Gritty Win Against Cardinals, Calls Out Rams’ Offense: A Bold Move Before Playoffs!","Two Los Angeles Chargers players were fined $6700 and $8200, respectively.

NEW DELHI: The intense battle between Yashasvi Jaiswal and Mitchell Starc reached new heights on the final day of the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Monday. In a display of mind games, Starc attempted to unsettle the young Indian opener during a tense session as India pursued a daunting target of 340 runs.The drama began when Starc switched the bails at the non-striker's end where Jaiswal was standing. Unfazed, Jaiswal immediately switched them back, much to the amusement of the crowd. The Australian pacer, known for his competitive streak, returned to his mark, but the incident was far from over.Two deliveries later, Starc and Jaiswal exchanged words in the middle of the pitch, adding an edge to an already high-stakes encounter. The Australian seamer seemed determined to win the psychological battle, while Jaiswal, holding one end of the Indian chase, stood firm. Rishabh Pant , Jaiswal’s batting partner, intervened in the next over, urging the young batter to keep his composure. The dynamic session saw Jaiswal shifting gears, dispatching a few boundaries that signaled his intent. The ongoing banter with Starc only added to the spectacle.Starc, refusing to relent, resumed his antics when he came back to bowl. He once again switched the bails at the non-striker's end, this time with Pant standing there. Unlike Jaiswal, Pant ignored the provocation, staying focused on the task at hand.The veteran pacer’s ploy was clear: rattle the young batter and disrupt India’s chase. With the pitch offering assistance to the bowlers, the hosts smelled blood after a fiery morning session saw them dismiss Rohit Sharma (9), KL Rahul (0), and Virat Kohli (5).The onus fell on India’s middle and lower order to salvage the game.Jaiswal, playing with a mix of grit and flair, symbolized India’s fighting spirit as he raised his bat after reaching another fifty with a four off Nathon Lyon. Despite Starc’s relentless sledging and on-field antics, the young batter remained defiant, ensuring the riveting contest continued.","Mitchell Starc attempted to unsettle Yashasvi Jaiswal during tense session.

Nitish Reddy reveals Virat Kohli’s special words for him after hundred at MCG

After dismissing Nathan Lyon in the opening over of the final morning in the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne , India's bowling ace Jasprit Bumrah registered his 30th wicket of the ongoing Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) series, a mark that hadn't been touched by a visiting bowler on Australian soil for over three decades.While Bumrah is only the second Indian after spin legend Bishan Singh Bedi to take 30 or more wickets in a single Test series in Australia, he is the first visiting bowler to touch that mark since the legendary West Indies pacer Curtly Ambrose 's 33 wickets during the Caribbean team's 1992-93 tour.Bedi took 31 wickets in five Tests during India's 1967-68 tour.England's John Snow (31 wickets in 1970-71) and New Zealand's Richard Hadlee (33 wickets in 1985-86) are the other two who have taken 30 or more wickets in a Test series in Australia in the last 70 years.But Bumrah has the best strike rate among all five at a staggering 28.2. Also, Bumrah's stunning average of 12.83 in this BGT is only second to Hadlee's 12.15 for bowlers with 20-plus wickets in any series in Australia.Continuing his bowling show that ranks among one of the greatest in the history of Test cricket, Bumrah also completed his third five-for of the series, which made him the fourth Indian bowler and the first Indian pacer to do that in a Test series in Australia, after spinners Bedi, BS Chandrasekhar and Anil Kumble.As far as the BGT is concerned, Bumrah now tops the list of bowlers with most wickets in a single edition of the BGT played in Australia. He has gone past Ben Hilfenhaus's 27 wickets, which the Aussie pacer took in the 2011-12 series.With three more wickets, Bumrah will break Harbhajan's Singh's record for most wickets in a single edition of the BGT. Harbhajan took 32 wickets with his off-spin in the 2001 series hosted by India.Australia, who were bowled out for 234 in their second innings on Monday, set India a daunting target of 340 to win on the final day.The five-Test series is tied at 1-1, with the concluding match to be played in Sydney.",Jasprit Bumrah takes 30th wicket of Border Gavaskar Trophy series.

London: Liverpool moved a step closer to a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title as a 5-0 thrashing of West Ham opened up an eight-point lead at the top of the Premier League Luis Diaz , Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah , Trent Alexander-Arnold and Diogo Jota were on target for the rampant Reds in east London as they ended the year as huge favourites to deliver just a second league title in 35 years.Nottingham Forest are the surprise closest challengers in second, but Arsenal and Chelsea can close the gap when they are in action later in the week.Arne Slot has repeatedly stressed nothing can be won yet with Liverpool still one game shy of the halfway mark in the Premier League.But the Dutchman's succession of Jurgen Klopp continues to look flawless after a 23rd win in 27 matches in all competitions.""I enjoyed it a lot because it doesn't happen many times that I could just sit back and enjoy,"" said Slot.Diaz had been rested for the 3-1 win over Leicester on Boxing Day and it was the Colombian who opened the floodgates on 30 minutes at the London Stadium.His intended pass into Curtis Jones rebounded back into his path off a West Ham defender and he dispatched his shot low into the corner.Mohammed Kudus was inches away from an equaliser when his effort came back off the post.But another heavy home defeat puts Hammers boss Julen Lopetegui back under pressure after a four-game unbeaten run.""We are talking about the best team in the Premier League and around the world, but at home and in front of our fans, I am very sorry about this,"" said Lopetegui.Two goals in four minutes just before half-time killed the game as a contest.Salah's delightful turn helped tee up Gakpo to roll in his ninth goal in 14 games.The Egyptian then curled in at Alphonse Areola's near post, with some help from the West Ham goalkeeper, to hit the 20-goal mark for the eighth consecutive season since joining Liverpool in 2017.Speculation over Alexander-Arnold, Salah and Virgil van Dijk's futures has not derailed Liverpool's flying start under Slot.All three could discuss a move to a foreign club on a free transfer next season within days, but remain focused for the moment on winning a second Premier League title together.""The only thing in my mind is that I want Liverpool to win the league and I want to be part of it,"" said Salah.""That is the only thing I have focused on. I will do my best to win the trophy. We are in the right direction but there are other teams trying to catch up with us. We just need to stay humble and go again.""Rumours over Alexander-Arnold's potential move to Real Madrid have resurfaced again in the Spanish media over the past week and the England international showed why he is a man in demand with a thunderous strike that deflected in off Max Kilman.Jota's appearance as a substitute was further evidence of the extra firepower Liverpool enjoy over their title rivals.The Portuguese set the seal on a dominant win with the finish for the fifth goal, but had another sumptuous Salah assist to thank for it.Salah jinked his way beyond three West Ham defenders before laying the ball to Jota for his 13th Premier League assist of the season to go with 17 goals in 18 games.","Liverpool thrash West Ham 5-0 at the London Stadium. Luis Diaz, Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Diogo Jota on target. Liverpool now eight points clear at the top of the Premier League.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116783240,imgsize-163286,width-400,resizemode-4/116783240.jpg"

MCG CEO Stuart Fox: 'We're going to go well over 2,50,000 through the gates'

A new attendance record has been established for a Test match in Australia. Over 350,700 spectators entered the Melbourne Cricket Ground ( MCG ) during the five days of the fourth Test between Australia and India. This surpasses the previous record of 350,534 set in 1937.Cricket Australia confirmed on Monday that 51,371 people had attended the first session of the fifth day, with more expected later.This attendance figure means the 2024 MCG Boxing Day Test has attracted more spectators than the six-day Test match between a Sir Donald Bradman-led Australia and England in January 1937 at the same venue.The crowds for this Test match have been exceptional.The daily attendance figures were 87,242, 85,147, 83,073, 43,867, and 51,371, with the final count for day five still pending.A higher attendance on day five compared to day four is unusual. The Melbourne Cricket Club, which manages the MCG, underestimated the day five numbers.The Melbourne Cricket Club opened Yarra Park outside the MCG for general public parking on day five. This is an uncommon occurrence.Only one gate was opened, causing significant traffic congestion before the start of play, resulting in some fans arriving late.These record-breaking numbers follow the substantial crowds that attended India's matches at the MCG during the 2022 T20 World Cup. A crowd of 90,293 watched India play Pakistan. Another 82,507 spectators attended the India versus Zimbabwe match.","Over 350,700 spectators entered the Melbourne Cricket Ground ( MCG ) during the five days of the fourth Test between Australia and India.

Will Eagles QB Jalen Hurts be playing in Sunday’s Game against The Cowboys?

How long will Jalen Hurts be out?

On December 29, 2024, Saquon Barkley and the Philadelphia Eagles will play against the Dallas Cowboys. The Eagles are now placed eighth on the points tally, and in terms of defense, they are ranked fifth with an 18.9 PB/game allowed. The Cowboys are 16th in terms of total offense with an average of 328.1 yards made every game and 27th, allowing 359.6 yards in a game.From being second to the bottom in passing offense in the NFL at 183 passing yards per game, it has been another story on the other end for the Eagles, who rank second in terms of defense. Primary Eagles star Jalen Hurts had 23 TD passes, 15 interceptions, completing 65.4 percent of his passes in 17 games last year for 3,858 yards gain. As reported, Hurts still rides with the NFL's concussion protocol. So the main question is, whether or not Jalen Hurts is playing the game this weekend.No, Jalen Hurts will not play in Sunday’s Game against The Cowboys. Hurts is still under the NFL's concussion protocol; thus, the team will come to Dallas on Sunday without its star quarterback.Backup Kenny Pickett will get the nod for Sunday as Hurts continues to recover from the effects of a concussion sustained in the game against Washington when he collided with a helmet and went down.In Week 16, Hurts suffered a concussion during a loss to the Washington Commanders and did not return to the game. Backup quarterback Kenny Pickett finished out the rest of the divisional game and will get the start this Sunday in Week 17. Hurts was taken down by Washington linebackers Bobby Wagner and Frankie Luvu on a scramble, and his head smacked into the ground, sending him off for concussion evaluation. Hurts made eye contact with umpire Alex Moore but didn't get back up.Hurts was tackled by Washington linebackers Bobby Wagner and Frankie Luvu during a scramble for 13 yards. His head slammed against the ground, requiring extra time and assistance from an offensive lineman. Despite eye contact with umpire Alex Moore, Hurts was sent off for a concussion evaluation, despite his initial thumbs up.Hurts went to the blue medical tent briefly before returning to the Eagles sideline. Moments later, trainers sent Hurts back to the locker room, where he was officially diagnosed with a concussion and ruled out.Late Friday afternoon, the Eagles officially declared Hurts out for Sunday's game against the Cowboys due to his ongoing recovery from his concussion. Head coach Nick Sirianni stated that Hurts is still in the NFL's concussion protocol and it will be challenging for him to participate in this week's practices. Hurts was absent from Wednesday and Thursday's Eagles practices and was reported to be absent at Friday's practice.Also Read: The Los Angeles Chargers secured a playoff spot in head coach Jim Harbaugh's first season by defeating the New England Patriots 40-7 Hurts will miss the Eagles' Week 17 game because of concussion protocol. It will be determined how he does that will tell if he has to sit out for more time. Several players have missed more than one game this season due to concussions, including Tua Tagovailoa and Trevor Lawrence, who have also spent time on injured reserve. Hurts' return depends on his progress in the concussion protocol in the coming days and weeks.","Jalen Hurts is still under the NFL's concussion protocol.

“Should be fired”: The NFL world remained dissatisfied with Bengals head coach Zac Taylor's clock management during the game against Broncos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/should-be-fired-the-nfl-world-remained-dissatisfied-with-bengals-head-coach-zac-taylors-clock-management-during-the-game-against-broncos/articleshow/116756837.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

The clock management by Cincinnati Bengals head coach Zac Taylor was in question

The Bengals and the Broncos played an entertaining match during Week 17 with great moments and touchdowns. The Bengals won, however, as they outdid Denver 30-24 after an overtime Tee Higgins score. The match happened under the Cincinnati sky. After the win, Cincinnati stands at 8-8, still holding on to its hopes of making the postseason. Things looked hairy for Zac Taylor's team, however, especially after Denver made it to the end zone in the final moments of regulation.In the final seconds of the game, Bengals nearly lost their chance for the postseason with a 17-17 game; however, Cincinnati recovered the ball with a Bo Nix interception . Chase Brown tried to set up the game-winning Bengals field goal, but was injured, which stopped the clock. At this point, Cincinnati chose to go for a broken touchdown instead of a time-sapping strategy, giving the Bengals the game-winning field goal attempt.The clock management by Cincinnati Bengals head coach Zac Taylor was in question after overtime was enforced by the Broncos. On an interception by Broncos quarterback Bo Nix, the Bengals took the ball inside the five-yard line of the Broncos and utilized their last timeout. Bengals running back Chase Brown wisely slid to reach the end zone.The Bengals, despite Brown's injury, elected to take the ball and score a touchdown on second down, despite the Broncos having taken their final timeout of the game. They did so immediately, giving the Broncos the ball with more than a minute left to play. The Broncos drove down the field and got to 4th down. With the game tied, quarterback Nix made an incredible touchdown to Marvin Mims, sending it into overtime. If the extra timeout was not granted, perhaps Nix could not have made the magic at the end of regulation.The Bengals won overtime against the Broncos, but the NFL world remained dissatisfied with Taylor's clock management after the game. One fan wrote on Twitter, ""I have no idea how Zac Taylor has a head coaching job. Another guy who has no clock management and situational awareness."" Another wrote, ""Zac Taylor and the entire Bengals coaching staff should be fired before the overtime for that absolutely idiotic clock management."" A third wrote, ""zac taylor going for the TD and giving denver 90 seconds with one timeout for a game tying drive surely this won't backfire!”Taylor defended his decision after Brown's injury, stating that his mindset changed postgame. “The injury changed everything,"" Taylor said. ""We were going to be able to kick the walk-off field goal with about 10 seconds … we were telling Chase to slide at the one because we figured they were going to let us score there, which he did. Unfortunately, got his ankle so they charged us with the timeout, so then that changes everything.""He further added, 'Now you’re in a second and goal at the one. You can down it and make sure they use their timeout and then try to score a touchdown from there on third down and maybe kick it on fourth, but you saw our red zone against them.”Also Read: Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix's 51-yard cannon against the Cincinnati Bengals was the longest throw of 2024 Cincinnati's Higgins overcame the game and bailed out questionable time management by Taylor and a missed field goal by Cade York. The win would still not inspire confidence, though, in Bengals fans, as they prepare to enter Week 18 to take on the Steelers in what could be a vital matchup.","The clock management by Cincinnati Bengals head coach Zac Taylor was in question.

NEW DELHI: A gritty partnership of over 50 runs for the final wicket between Nathan Lyon and Scott Boland left India exasperated as Australia extended their lead to over 300 runs on day four of the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.In a day packed with enthralling Test cricket, India bowlers had removed Marnus Labuschagne , Mitchell Starc, and Pat Cummins during the final session, raising hopes of starting their chase before stumps.However, Lyon and Boland stood firm, frustrating the Indian bowlers with a resilient stand at the iconic MCG. Their partnership not only defied India but also turned the tide of the match.This marked just the second instance in Test history where a 10th-wicket pair batted for over 50 balls in both innings.The first instance occurred in 1961, when Pakistan’s Afaq Hussain and Haseeb Ahsan faced England in Lahore, lasting 9.2 overs in the first innings and 18.1 overs in the second.Lyon and Boland batted for 8.3 overs in the first innings and a pivotal 17.4 overs in the second.Drama unfolded late in the day when Lyon was caught in the slip cordon by Jasprit Bumrah during the last over. However, replays confirmed it was a no-ball, keeping the partnership intact.Earlier, India seemed on the verge of wrapping up the innings when Ravindra Jadeja bowled a superb delivery, pitching on off stump and turning away to edge Pat Cummins’s bat, dismissing him for a determined 41 off 90 balls. But with the bowlers tiring and the ball softening, Lyon and Boland capitalized on the opportunity to mount a defiant stand.India’s desperation showed as Siraj dropped a caught-and-bowled chance off Lyon and later lost their final review on an unsuccessful lbw appeal. Boland’s cut off Siraj brought up Australia’s 300, while Lyon showcased an array of strokes, including sweeps, lofted shots, and edges that kept the scoreboard ticking.In the day’s final moments, KL Rahul’s tumbling leg-assisted catch off Lyon was overturned due to Bumrah overstepping. Lyon then edged the last ball for a boundary, bringing up the 50-run partnership and closing out a remarkable day of Test cricket on a high for Australia.",Australia extend lead to over 300 runs on day four of the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

NEW DELHI: Legendary Sunil Gavaskar on Saturday angrily expressed his disapproval of Rishabh Pant 's shot selection during a critical moment on the third day of the Boxing Day Test .A fuming Gavaskar had slammed Pant for his ramp shot that got him out, labelling it as 'stupid'.For Gavaskar the Pant shot was driven by ego rather than strategic thinking.""When I see somebody as talented as Rishabh Pant play that shot, I had no problem with the first shot he played and missed. The reason I got upset was that ego took over for the next ball,"" Gavaskar told ABC Sport.Gavaskar elaborated on why he found Pant's shot selection particularly frustrating, suggesting Pant was trying to assert dominance rather than playing to the situation.""I've just been hit in the midriff for attempting a similar shot. I'm going to show the bowler who's the boss. Test cricket is not easy. When he got out, they had two fielders in the deep, and this is a big ground. It's not easy to hit sixes. You've got the fielders in catching positions over there—deep square leg and deep fine leg. But he got caught at third man with the edge.""Gavaskar acknowledged Pant's talent and past performances but questioned the need for such a risky shot at that stage of the game.""I've seen him play some fabulous innings. But here in Australia, I get the impression that he thinks that's the only way he's going to score runs. Here he's stepping down the pitch, lofting the ball, and getting a boundary. That's not the way he has scored runs in the past. He has played those shots which have been outrageously good,"" Gavaskar said.Gavaskar highlighted Pant's ability to score runs through conventional cricketing shots, suggesting he should rely on his established strengths rather than attempting high-risk strokes.""I've seen him play the cover drive along the ground very well, the square pull shot he plays so well, the flick off the pads—everything he's got. So, to take a little bit of a risk at that stage was a bit much,"" said Gavaskar.",Sunil Gavaskar criticises Rishabh Pant's shot selection on third day of Boxing Day Test.

I appreciate he's emotional, and he desperately wants wickets, but you're the one who has to send the message of calm and support.

Lautaro back in the goals

Atalanta kept hold of top spot in Serie A on Saturday after escaping Lazio with a 1-1 draw which kept Inter Milan at bay but ended their club-record league winning streak at 11 matches.Marco Brescianini tapped home into an open goal with two minutes remaining to snatch a point from the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, where a passionate crowd thought a big win was coming their way.Instead Atalanta will end a historic year a point ahead of Inter, who have a game in hand, after the champions briefly drew level on points with a 3-0 win earlier at Cagliari .Europa League holders Atalanta will lead the league even if Napoli beat Venezia on Sunday and draw level on 41 points with Gian Piero Gasperini 's side who have a significantly better goal difference than the 2023 champions.Should two teams finish level at the top of Serie A come the end of the season they will face off in a single match to decide the destination of the Scudetto, which Atalanta have never won.""We struggled for long periods in the first half, but we were much better in the second,"" said Atalanta coach Gasperini.""This year has been the best year in Atalanta's history, let's hope we can make 2025 the same.""Atalanta showed great character to battle back from Fisayo Dele-Bashiru's 27th-minute goal which came in an intense opening period from Lazio.The away side were initially blitzed by Lazio, with Marco Carnesecchi making two sensational stops before Matteo Guendouzi curled a great strike off the post in the 11th minute.But as the match wore on, Atalanta, who were without injured star striker Mateo Retegui, grew into the game and deservedly drew level in front of a boisterous and hostile crowd in the Italian capital.Brescianini netted his third goal of the season thanks largely to Ademola Lookman, who made up for earlier missing from yards out by beating Lazio's offside trap, meeting Nicolo Zaniolo's hooked pass and rolling across to his teammate to salvage a precious point.Next up, Atalanta travel to play the Italian Super Cup in Saudi Arabia, where they will face Inter on Thursday.Lautaro Martinez ended an eight-match scoring drought at Cagliari, netting the second in an engaging contest in Sardinia which Inter won with second-half goals from the Argentina striker, Alessandro Bastoni and Hakan Calhanoglu.Inter have won their last five in Italy's top flight, scoring 19 and conceding just once, a burst in form which has re-established Inter as favourites to retain the Scudetto.The only thing missing for Inter were goals from captain Martinez, who hadn't scored since November 3 before he prodded home Nicolo Barella's cross in the 71st minute on Saturday.""The most important thing is that Inter win. If I get a goal too, then that's a bonus,"" said Martinez.""We work hard every day to win trophies and anyone who sets foot on the pitch will give their all for the team. We've just got to keep going and make 2025 like this year.""Inter could have won by an even more convincing margin had captain Martinez not wasted great chances in each half and Cagliari goalkeeper Simone Scuffet not pulled off superb saves to deny Marcus Thuram and Barella.But Martinez did net his seventh goal this season in all competitions and seven minutes later Calhanoglu made absolutely sure of the points from the penalty spot.Cagliari are just inside the relegation zone after a fourth consecutive defeat for Davide Nicola's side, a point behind Verona and Como who both play on Monday.",Atalanta draw 1-1 with Lazio at Stadio Olimpico in Rome. Marco Brescianini scores late equaliser for Atalanta. Inter Milan beat Cagliari 3-0 to draw level on points.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116757496,imgsize-257872,width-400,resizemode-4/116757496.jpg"

NEW DELHI: 22-year-old Ivory Coast forward Amad Diallo has expressed his determination to ""make history"" with Manchester United despite the club's recent struggles under new manager Ruben Amorim .United have lost five out of Amorim's first 10 games in charge across all competitions, with recent defeats to Wolves, Bournemouth, and Tottenham increasing the pressure on the Portuguese manager ahead of Newcastle's visit to Old Trafford.Despite the team's dismal form, which has seen them languish in 14th place in the Premier League , just eight points above the relegation zone , Diallo has been one of United's few bright spots.He scored a late winner in the recent derby against Manchester City and has contributed two goals and six assists in the league this season.Diallo, along with other young players like Alejandro Garnacho, Kobbie Mainoo, Joshua Zirkzee, and Rasmus Hojlund, has set his sights on taking United back to the top.""We are part of the project, we have so many young players for this club, especially Garna (Alejandro Garnacho), Kobbie (Mainoo), Joshua (Zirkzee), Rasmus (Hojlund), me, we are young players who want to make history for this club,"" Diallo told MUTV.""We want to do our best every game. Sometimes it cannot work, but you can see in the pitch we are very focused to do our best for this club, because we want to bring back this club to the level it was before.""So, for the young lads, we just have to keep going, work hard and the most important thing is to listen to the old men, the old players, learn every day.""We have now a new manager, he likes to work with young players, and he brings a new system, so we just have to follow it and try to do our best every game.""""In football this can happen,"" he added. ""Don't be focused in only one position. Sometimes you can play as a defender, sometimes as a striker. Wherever the manager puts me I'm ready to fight for the team.""I just want to play, right wing, number 10, anywhere. I say to the manager if you need me as a 'keeper I'm ready to do my best, I will fight for the team and for my team-mates. I want to make history for this club.""","Amad Diallo has expressed his determination to ""make history"" with Manchester United.

Man City's Pep Guardiola says he'll not give up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/man-citys-pep-guardiola-says-hell-not-give-up/articleshow/116746322.cms,"Pep Guardiola (AP photo)

NEW DELHI: Pep Guardiola has affirmed his commitment to Manchester City , dismissing speculation about his departure amidst the club's recent struggles.Guardiola recently extended his contract for two more years.Despite City's current poor form, Guardiola is determined to remain at the Etihad Stadium. The team has experienced a significant dip in performance, losing nine out of their last thirteen matches.The slump has led to questions about Guardiola's future with the club. Some have suggested he might leave if he can't reverse the team's fortunes.However, Guardiola, who has guided City to six Premier League titles in seven seasons, insisted he remains motivated to turn things around.""I will try, I will keep going. Sometimes you think the bad run will be ended earlier or it would be easier to fix it, but it takes more time,"" he said.""I will not give up. I want to be here. I want to do it and, with the situation that we have, we have to do it.""Of course I want it, everyone wants it. I don't want to disappoint my people in terms of the club, the fans, the people who love this club.""I think all of us in our job want to do it well and please the people. That is undeniable, not a question mark.""The biggest test is to come back again, but we have done that before.""Injuries have significantly hampered City's performance, contributing to their current seventh-place standing in the Premier League. Key players have been sidelined due to various injuries.Rodri, the Ballon d'Or winner, is recovering from a long-term knee injury. Other key players, including Ruben Dias, John Stones, Ederson, Kyle Walker, Jack Grealish, and Matheus Nunes, missed the recent draw against Everton.Even Erling Haaland, typically a prolific goal scorer, has struggled recently. He missed a penalty in the Everton match, extending his recent goal drought.Haaland has scored only once in his last seven games, but Guardiola refused to single him out for criticism. He emphasized his philosophy of not assigning blame to individual players.""I don't have it in my education to start complaining, to point at people. It's happened, it's life, it's football, so let's try it again,"" he said.""That's why we have had success, because always it is never enough, we will try it again and again and again. That's why we won a lot of titles.""Every three days it was a game and win, win, win for many, many months and years. Now we have to do the same when results are not good.""As City prepares to face Leicester City, several players are still recovering from injuries. Guardiola acknowledged the impact of injuries on the team's performance.""Sometimes you have injuries,"" Guardiola said. ""For how many years we were incredibly consistent but now, yes, we're a little bit down and the main reason is having so many important players injured.""But I saw the team spirit, how we trained this week, how focused they are, how they try to practise.""","Guardiola recently extended his contract for two more years.

The strike from Kai Havertz proved decisive as Arsenal secured a 1-0 victory against Ipswich , advancing to second position in the Premier League standings, while Bukayo Saka remained absent after his hamstring injury in the match against Crystal Palace last weekend.Arsenal's win reduced Premier League leaders Liverpool 's advantage to six points on Friday, as they capitalised on Chelsea's unexpected 2-1 loss to Fulham on Thursday to emerge as Liverpool's nearest rivalSaka, meanwhile, might not return until March due.Arsenal's manager opted to position Gabriel Martinelli on the right flank, typically occupied by Saka, whilst maintaining Gabriel Jesus as the central striker following his impressive tally of five goals in the previous two matches.Despite controlling much of the ball, the hosts struggled to create significant opportunities until the last 15 minutes of the contest.Arsenal experienced relief when Havertz scored at 23 minutes, following their previous frustrating 0-0 draw against Everton at the Emirates.Havertz netted his 12th goal of the season by directing Leandro Trossard's low cross into the upper part of the goal. But Jesus's strike with a clever shot through Arijanet Muric's legs from a difficult position was ruled as offside.Despite their well-known effectiveness from set-pieces, Arsenal failed to capitalise on their corner opportunities.Gabriel Magalhaes missed a straightforward chance when his header struck the outside of the post from close range.Ipswich displayed increasing ambition in the latter half, which also provided Arsenal more opportunities to counter-attack.Havertz squandered an excellent opportunity to score his second goal, whilst Muric produced another save from Mikel Merino's effort, ensuring a tense conclusion.Ipswich continue to occupy the penultimate position in the table, with a three-point gap separating them from safety.","Arsenal defeated Ipswich 1-0 in their Premier League clash.

Tough Start for Ruud

NEW DELHI: Germany made a strong start on Sunday in defending their United Cup title, with world number two Alexander Zverev and Laura Siegemund securing victory over Brazil, eliminating the South Americans from the mixed-team tournament.Zverev sealed the win with a commanding 6-4, 6-4 performance against Thiago Monteiro, following Siegemund’s gritty 6-3, 1-6, 6-4 triumph over Beatriz Haddad Maia, who is ranked 17th, 63 places above her.The result in Perth knocked Brazil out of group play after an earlier defeat to China.Germany now faces China on Monday, with the winner advancing to the quarter-finals.In Sydney, women’s world number four Jasmine Paolini cruised past Belinda Bencic 6-1, 6-1 in just 57 minutes, ensuring Italy’s victory over Switzerland.Meanwhile, men’s world number six Casper Ruud endured a tough battle against Tomas Machac but couldn’t prevent Norway’s loss to the Czech Republic.Zverev set the tone against Monteiro by breaking serve in the opening game of each set, wrapping up the 80-minute contest without facing significant pressure. It marked an unusual position for Germany, who often relied on deciding mixed doubles matches in last year’s tournament.""This is the first time we've ever been up 2-0,"" Zverev said. ""Last year, I played deciding (mixed doubles) matches every time.""It's nice to have this (tie) in the bag. I'm very happy to be playing for Germany again.""Siegemund battled for over two and a half hours to outlast Haddad Maia.After a dominant first set, the German faltered in the second but regained composure in a tense final set, winning after three consecutive service breaks and sealing the match on her first match point.Paolini’s strong form carried over from her stellar 2024 season, which included runner-up finishes at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. She overpowered Bencic, who is making a comeback after maternity leave.""I played a really good match. Today everything worked really well,"" said Paolini.""I was serving and returning well, and I think that was the key.""Earlier, Flavio Cobolli defeated Dominic Stricker 6-3, 7-6 (6/2), giving Italy an initial lead.Meanwhile, Ruud, the highest-ranked Norwegian in history, faced a grueling match against Machac. After nearly three hours, Ruud emerged victorious 7-6 (7/6), 5-7, 6-4, leveling the tie 1-1 after Karolina Muchova’s dominant 6-2, 6-2 win over Malene Helgo.However, Ruud opted out of the deciding mixed doubles due to left quad discomfort. Machac and Muchova capitalized, defeating Viktor Durasovic and Ulrikke Eikeri 6-4, 6-4 to secure the Czech Republic’s win.""You kind of hope that it won't be that tough, but what a way to start the new season,"" said Ruud, who banked 2024 tournament wins at Geneva and Barcelona.""If every match is going to be this tough, it's going to be a tough (season).""Ruud’s concern may grow as he faced nine break points during the match, despite his early control in the third set.","World number two Alexander Zverev and Laura Siegemund secure victory over Brazil.
