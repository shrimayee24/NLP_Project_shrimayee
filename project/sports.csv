Citizenship Amendment Act: Final hearing on challenge to CAA in SC from May 5,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/final-hearing-on-challenge-to-caa-in-sc-from-may-5/articleshow/128584988.cms,"An anti-CAA

New Delhi: More than six years after its enactment sparked riots in Delhi, the Supreme Court on Thursday scheduled a four-day final hearing from May 5 on 243 petitions challenging the validity of Citizenship (Amendment) Act that provides a pathway for citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis and Christians who may reach India after fleeing religious persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi said the petitioners, that include Muslim organisations among which Indian Union of Muslim League has been termed the lead petitioner, and functionaries from Congress, TMC and AIMIM, would conclude their arguments within one and half days and the Centre would respond in a similar time frame. May 12 has been kept for rejoinders to be filed by petitioners.On Dec 18, 2019, a three-judge bench, which included Justice Kant, had issued notice to the Centre on the petitions challenging CAA on the ground of discrimination against Muslims who came to India from neighbouring countries but were not entitled to citizenship under CAA.Protesters, mainly Muslim women supported by political parties, had blocked a major arterial road in Shaheen Bagh here from Dec 15, 2019 till March 24, 2020.Blockades were organised in other parts of the city too. The resultant tension triggered riots in northeast Delhi on Feb 23, 2020 that lasted several days and left 53 dead.SC had last heard the petitions on March 19, 2024, the year the Centre framed Citizenship (Amendment) Rules. The Centre had filed its response to the petitions in Oct 2022 and termed CAA a benign piece of legislation providing Indian citizenship to members of those communities who have been persecuted for the last 70 years in the three neighbouring Islamic countries of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.Countering the plea that CAA discriminated against Muslims, the Centre had said, ""CAA does not seek to recognise or seek to provide answers to all or any kind of purported persecution that may be taking place across the world or that may have taken place previously anywhere in the world.""On Thursday, the bench agreed with solicitor general Tushar Mehta that the challenge to CAA in relation to Assam and Tripura, where separate accords set deadlines for entry of migrants from Bangladesh, could be de-linked from the ones which have questioned the law from a pan-India perspective.","Citizenship (Amendment) Act provides pathway for citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis and Christians who may reach India after fleeing religious persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

Themade a major roster move in early February 2026, trading for. Golden State sent Jonathan Kuminga and Buddy Hield to Atlanta, signaling a clear shift toward competing now rather than building for the future.Porzingis has started adjusting to a lineup that includes Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, and Jimmy Butler. His arrival has led to questions around the league about how much he can change the team’s outlook and whether the risk attached to his health is worth it.General manager Mike Dunleavy pursued Porzingis to improve scoring and spacing in the frontcourt after Jimmy Butler suffered a season-ending injury. The trade became official on February 4 and reflected urgency from a team still focused on the playoffs.Letting go of Kuminga meant losing a young forward with long-term upside, while Hield’s departure removed reliable outside shooting. The Warriors accepted that cost to add a skilled seven-footer with prior championship experience in Boston.Porzingis came off the bench in his debut and has shared minutes with Quinten Post and Al Horford as the coaching staff works through rotations.Since the trade, Kristaps Porzingis has averaged about 17-20 points per game, hit over 40 percent of his threes in some appearances, collected 8-10 rebounds, and offered rim protection despite limited playing time.He can shoot from deep, which works well alongside Curry’s constant movement and long-range shooting. Defenses have to spread out to cover both of them, and that opens up room for everyone else. That extra space could make it easier for the team to adjust while Butler is out.The concern is availability. Porzingis has played only a handful of games since the deal, and his injury history remains part of any evaluation. He is also 30, which adds to the debate about long-term value.Porzingis is known for his ability to shoot from distance and protect the rim, and he has hit over 35 percent of his three-point attempts in his career. Some critics, though, question his consistency on defense and point to his injury record when calling him overrated.Before the trade, he averaged 17.1 points and 5.1 rebounds on efficient shooting. Some analysts have placed him among the league’s most overrated players due to declining athleticism. The Warriors are not expecting a franchise-level star, but rather a player who can raise their ceiling without forcing a full roster reset.Golden State Warriors had been linked to Giannis Antetokounmpo , but no trade developed. He publicly committed to Milwaukee, where he continues to play alongside his brothers Thanasis and Alex on a team sitting around the middle of the standings.With that option gone, the Warriors turned to a more realistic addition in Porzingis.Porzingis is not the star Golden State once hoped to land, but he gives them size, shooting, and lineup flexibility. If he stays on the court, the trade could help their postseason chances. If not, the decision to move young talent will face stronger scrutiny.","Kristaps Porzingis, nicknamed 'The Unicorn', is averaging 17.1 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 2.7 assists.

Sean Strickland turns media day into a rant about Bad Bunny and the NFL

Misogynistic shots at women’s sports put more pressure on Sean Strickland and Paramount+

Bad Bunny just delivered one of the biggest halftime audiences in Super Bowl history. Sean Strickland still turned him into a target.During a Paramount+ and UFC media day ahead of his fight with Anthony Hernandez, the former UFC middleweight champion went on a sexist, homophobic tirade that circled from women’s sports to the NFL’s Super Bowl LX halftime show and Bad Bunny’s spot on that stage.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Strickland unloaded on the NFL’s decision to put the Puerto Rican star at the center of this year’s halftime show at Levi’s Stadium.“Look at the NFL, dude. I don't even want to say the f***t's name because it's just like, somebody give me his name... You know what I'm talking about, the halftime show guy. The Puerto Rican, right? Puerto Rican? Yeah, that f**king f***t. It's so crazy that this is America now.”From there, he framed the league as something that had walked away from what he calls “being a man.”“Like, back in the day, the NFL was the f**king standard of being a f**king man, and now every f**king year, the NFL, I think they all get together around a table and say, ‘You know what, guys? How do we f**king ruin this sport? How do we gy it up? How do we f*cking ruin it? Well, I'll tell you what. Why don't we bring a gy foreigner who doesn't speak f**king English and have him perform it?’”Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl LX halftime show averaged roughly 128 million viewers, with the game itself pulling about 125 million, according to recent broadcast figures.The NFL has been aggressive about using global music stars to grow the audience. Strickland’s problem is not the ratings. It is the idea of a Spanish-speaking Latin pop and reggaeton artist being the face of the league’s biggest night.The comments also ignore a basic detail about the man he is attacking. Puerto Ricans are American citizens. That did not stop Strickland from labeling Bad Bunny a “foreigner” in the middle of a rant about what the NFL represents.Bad Bunny was not the only target. As reported by Variety’s Jack Dunn, Strickland also went at Ronda Rousey, Gina Carano, and women’s sports in general while promoting a Netflix MMA event.“Ronda Rousey can fight,” Strickland said. “That bitch can fight… I think she lost a few fights to her ex, but bitch can fight.”On Carano, he kept the focus on her looks instead of her fighting career. “I like Gina. She’s like super conservative. She was hot, you know. I was like a kid when she fought. I may have jerked off to her once or twice back in the day.”Then he went broad. “No one gives a fuck about women’s sports,” Strickland said, before adding that women “cook” and “clean” and claiming they have been empowered “too much” and “ruined society.”This is the same fighter who was suspended by the UFC in July 2025 after attacking another fighter while working as a cornerman. Now he is back in a main promotional window at a time when Paramount+ has a seven-year, multibillion-dollar rights deal to be the exclusive home of UFC events in the United States.The blowback has started. Former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III called him out on X after the Bad Bunny comments.“Sean Strickland got hit so hard by a foreigner that he forgot Puerto Ricans are US citizens,” Griffin wrote. “Not to mention that this misogynistic cry baby would get tossed like salad if he ever stepped foot on a football field in the NFL. Worry about not getting knocked out in your next fight.”For the NFL, Bad Bunny’s halftime show was a numbers win. For Paramount+ and the UFC, Strickland’s latest microphone moment is a test of how much bigoted noise they are willing to live with from one of their most volatile names.","Sean Strickland turned media day into a rant about Bad Bunny and the NFL.

Islam Makhachev says Michael Morales is a bigger threat than Ilia Topuria



Welterweight champion Islam Makhachev has played down the threat of Ilia Topuria moving up in weight to challenge him. Topuria recently became lightweight champion after knocking out Charles Oliveira at UFC 317. The Spaniard is now aiming to become the first fighter in UFC history to win titles in three weight divisions. However, Makhachev believes Topuria’s knockout power may not carry the same impact at 170 pounds.Topuria is expected to face interim lightweight champion Justin Gaethje in a title unification bout at a UFC event at the White House on June 14. Before any move to welterweight, he must get past Gaethje. Meanwhile, Makhachev has suggested that other welterweight contenders, including rising star Michael Morales, present a greater danger inside the Octagon.Speaking recently, Islam Makhachev claimed that Michael Morales is a far more dangerous striker at the welterweight division.Islam Makhachev explained that, in his view, Michael Morales carries far more knockout danger. He said Morales can finish opponents with almost every clean punch he lands. He added that Ilia Topuria may not have the same impact at 170 pounds because the division features bigger, taller, and stronger athletes.According to Makhachev, welterweights would find it easier to deal with Topuria, and he does not believe Topuria would pose a serious threat if he moved up.Makhachev had earlier hinted that he could fight Topuria in Washington, D.C., but later clarified that his first welterweight title defense will likely come against a current contender in the division.For now, Topuria’s focus remains on Gaethje. His coach, Javi Clement, is confident of a quick finish.Javi Clement expressed total confidence in Topuria’s ability to stop Justin Gaethje early in the possible White House UFC card. He said the fight would definitely end in the first round and likely in the opening exchange. Clement insisted that once Topuria lands cleanly, opponents cannot keep moving forward. He warned that if Gaethje tries to pressure recklessly, he could face the same outcome as Oliveira. Clement also mentioned that Gaethje has technical flaws that have already been studied, and those mistakes could prove costly on fight night.For now, all eyes will be on Ilia Topuria and Justin Gaethje’s possible bout.",Islam Makhachev says Michael Morales is a bigger threat than Ilia Topuria.

The Rashee Rice Defense: Why a 2025 Affidavit Is the Key to His New Case

""Mr. Rice and I had a verbal argument, but he did not punch me.""

Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice is once again at the center of a legal firestorm. Just months after settling felony charges related to a high-speed car crash, Rice is now facing a $1 million civil lawsuit alleging a disturbing pattern of domestic violence by his former partner Dacoda Jones.The lawsuit, filed on February 16, 2026, in Dallas County, comes from Rice’s former partner and the mother of his two children, Dacoda Jones. According to court documents, Jones alleges that Rice subjected her to physical abuse over an 18-month period, spanning from December 2023 to July 2025.The claims are graphic, with Jones alleging that Rice ""grabbed, choked, strangled, pushed, and headbutted"" her. Most notably, the suit claims several of these incidents occurred while Jones was pregnant. She is seeking damages for physical injury, mental anguish, and medical expenses.Rice’s legal team, led by attorney Sean Lindsey, has moved quickly to dispute the claims. In a statement released to the media, Lindsey highlighted a ""sworn Affidavit for Non-Prosecution"" signed by Jones on October 9, 2025, months after the alleged abuse ended.In that document, Jones reportedly stated under penalty of perjury:Lindsey argues this previous statement contradicts the current lawsuit, suggesting the allegations are inconsistent with her prior testimony.This new case puts Rice’s career and freedom in significant jeopardy. Having already served a six-game suspension in 2025 for his hit-and-run conviction, Rice is now considered a repeat offender under the NFL’s Personal Conduct Policy. This could lead to a baseline suspension of at least six games, or potentially an indefinite ban. Rice is currently serving five years of probation for his 2024 street racing incident. If the allegations in this civil suit lead to criminal charges or are deemed a violation of his ""good behavior"" requirements, a judge could revoke his probation, potentially resulting in years of prison time.The Kansas City Chiefs and the NFL have both confirmed they are ""monitoring the situation."" While Rice played eight games in the 2025 season following his initial suspension, his future for the 2026 season is now entirely uncertain. For now, both parties appear content to let the legal process play out in court.","Rashee Rice is facing a $1 million civil lawsuit alleging a pattern of domestic violence by his former partner Dacoda Jones.

Stephen Curry's injury status against Boston Celtics

Stephen Curry's 2026 NBA All-Star Press Conference

How Stephen Curry's absence will impact the Warriors

It was expected that the Golden State Warriors (29-26) would return from the All-Star break with Stephen Curry to face the Boston Celtics (35-19) at Chase Center on February 19th. But they will have to play without their offensive cornerstone, as he continues to nurse a persistent knee injury.The 2-time MVP’s absence marks a critical blow for Warriors, as they are currently 8th in the West, and are fighting to avoid the Play-In Tournament. While Curry needed this break to provide a window for rest and recovery, the team’s heavy dependence on him for scoring remains a point of concern. The franchise’s medical staff is cautious with the 37-year-old’s health, as they need him in his optimal condition to make the most out of his talents on the court.Stephen Curry is dealing with knee cap soreness, also known as runner's knee, and due to this, he hasn’t appeared in a game since January 30th, and was also forced to withdraw from the 2026 NBA All-Star Game, his 12th All-Star appearance.Curry told ESPN, ""You have to try to get rid of all the inflammation and pain. It's something we still have to monitor and injury-manage, but it's something where, if I come back too early, it could flare up.""Even Steve Kerr emphasized being “certain” with the injury, as they require Curry to come back completely healed. He stated, “We've got to be certain. He's got to be certain. It is a little nebulous, but that's the nature of the injury.""The game against the Celtics will be Curry’s sixth consecutive game that he has missed and 17th of this season. The baby-faced assassin has played in 39 games so far and has averaged 27.2 points, 4.8 assists, and 3.5 rebounds, while shooting 39.1% from beyond the arc and 46.8% from the floor.According to StatMuse, the Warriors currently have a 6-10 record without Stephen Curry. They have an offensive rating of 119.3 with Curry on the court, but it drops to roughly 106.4 without him, while the shooting efficiency from the floor also drops from 47.5% to 42.7% and from 45.4% to 44.2% from deep.The Warriors are already without Jimmy Butler (season-ending ACL tear) and Seth Curry (sciatica). However, there is a silver lining: Kristaps Porzingis. Acquired in a blockbuster deadline trade for Jonathan Kuminga and Buddy Hield, Porzingis is expected to make his Warriors debut tonight while providing a much-needed interior gravity at the post-up.The Celtics have a 113.5 defensive rating this season, and have been able to limit their opponents to just 108.4 PPG. Without Stephen Curry, the Warriors will struggle offensively, but the team has maintained a solid defense this season and has the 9th-best defensive rating of 113.5%.",Golden State Warriors face Boston Celtics at Chase Center on February 19th. Stephen Curry will miss the game with a persistent knee injury. The Warriors are currently 8th in the West and fighting to avoid the Play-In Tournament. Kristaps Porzingis is expected to make his Warriors debut against the Celtics.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128566336,imgsize-23918,width-400,resizemode-4/stephen-curry.jpg"

Danny Torres Facebook Post: Every Word the Retired Officer Said About Tyreek Hill

""Hmmm… I guess it took a bit, but

Karma

got you,""

""Now that I am retired I can tell you how I feel about you. You’re an entitled A**OLE and an embarrassment to the team and city that kissed your a**.""

""I hope you are able to afford ALL that child support, especially now that you’re unemployed.""

Miami New Times

In the NFL, things move fast but in Miami, the drama moves even faster. This week, the football world was rocked when the Miami Dolphins officially released superstar wideout Tyreek Hill. While the move was strictly business, a ""cap-clearing"" decision following Hill’s season-ending 2025 knee injury, it sparked a very personal, very public explosion from a ghost of Hill's past.On Tuesday, February 17, 2026, a Facebook post began spreading through Miami like wildfire. The author? Danny Torres, the former Miami-Dade police officer who became the face of a national controversy in 2024 after he was filmed dragging Hill from his sports car and pinning him to the asphalt.Torres, who has since retired from the force, didn't hold back. Now free from the constraints of departmental gag orders, he viewed Hill’s release and injury as divine justice.Torres wrote.The retired officer didn't stop there, taking a sharp jab at Hill's personal life by adding,The irony of the situation wasn't lost on the fans or on Hill himself. Shortly after the Dolphins announced they were moving on from their $120 million investment, Hill leaned into the chaos. He briefly changed his Instagram bio to a single word: ""Unemployed.""While Hill is arguably the most dangerous weapon in the league when healthy, the road back is steep. At 31 years old and coming off a major ACL reconstruction, his future is a massive question mark. For Torres, this is the ""Karma"" he’s been waiting for since he was placed on administrative leave nearly two years ago.When asked for comment by the, Torres doubled down, stating he was ""crucified"" for doing his job in 2024 and felt it was finally his turn to speak his truth. Hill, meanwhile, remains ""Born Again"" (as his social media suggests), focusing on his recovery and a potential 2026 comeback with a new team.Whether you see this as a retired officer finally speaking his mind or a bitter man kicking a player while he’s down, one thing is certain: the bad blood between the Officer and the Cheetah hasn't cooled one bit.","Danny Torres, the former Miami-Dade police officer who was filmed dragging Tyreek Hill from his sports car and pinning him to the asphalt in 2024, wrote a Facebook post about Hill on February 17, 2026.

Dacoda Jones celebrates son Cayden’s second birthday after filing lawsuit against Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice

Dacoda Jones is choosing to talk about her son, not the court case. Just days after filing a civil lawsuit in Texas accusing Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice of abuse, she shared a loving birthday message for their child instead. On Instagram, Jones posted a photo collage as their son, Cayden, turned two years old. Her message did not mention the legal fight. It focused only on her little boy and how much she loves him.The timing stood out. Earlier this week, reports confirmed that Dacoda Jones filed a lawsuit against Rashee Rice, claiming there were several incidents of physical abuse during their relationship. According to the filing, the alleged incidents happened between December 2023 and July 2025, including a period when she was pregnant. Rashee Rice, through his legal team, has denied the claims. The case is now in court. Still, on her son’s birthday, Dacoda Jones kept the attention on family.In her Instagram post, Dacoda Jones shared smiling photos of Cayden and wrote, “How are you already two?! My sweet face where is time going 🥹 my spark of energy, my bundle of joy, you complete me in every day Happy Birthday baby boy mama lovessss you 🫶”The post showed simple family moments. There was no mention of the lawsuit.No reference to Rashee Rice. Just birthday pictures and a mother celebrating her child.As reported earlier this week, the civil lawsuit was filed in Texas. In the complaint, Dacoda Jones described what she called a pattern of abuse during their relationship. Rashee Rice has denied any wrongdoing through his attorneys, and the legal process is ongoing. No final ruling has been made.Rashee Rice, who plays for the Kansas City Chiefs, has not made a personal public statement beyond the response shared by his legal team. The matter remains active in court, and both sides are expected to present their arguments there.For now, Dacoda Jones’ public message sends a clear signal. While the legal situation continues, her social media page was centered on her son’s milestone. Turning two is a big moment for any child, and she marked it with photos, warm words, and a mother’s pride. Even with serious claims being discussed in court, her latest post shows that, at least publicly, her focus is on Cayden and his birthday celebration.","Dacoda Jones filed a civil lawsuit in Texas accusing Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice of abuse.

She said in a 2018 interview with SI""I was a goalkeeper for five or six years. That was everything I wanted to do.I started playing when I was 8, 9 years old… Because I started modeling at 13, I had to stop. How can I have pretty hands and still play soccer? It's been a while since I played. But if I had a couple weeks off, I would start again.""De Paula’s father is a physician, while her mother works as an X-ray technician.

Sydney Sweeney

Hannah Stocking and Charlotte Flair rumors

Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua is one of the NFL’s rising stars, thanks to his record-breaking rookie season. His off-field life has also attracted attention, especially when it comes to his relationships and rumored dating history. Over the past few years, the 24-year-old has been linked with influencers, actresses, and fellow celebrities.While he has kept his private life low, public appearances, social media interactions, and reports have offered glimpses into his dating life. From long-term relationships to recent rumors, here is a look at who the Rams star has been linked to so far.Nacua and Hallie Aiono were together from 2021 to early 2025. Aiono often posted about their relationship on social media, and he was there for Nacua throughout important times in his early NFL career. When Nacua scored his first professional touchdown, she publicly tweeted an emotional response that went viral among fans.Later reports suggested that the couple separated in 2025. Despite the breakup, they welcomed their son Kingston later that year, marking an important chapter in Nacua’s personal life.Since then, both have maintained a relatively private approach to co-parenting.Nacua’s dating life gained wider pop-culture attention when he interacted with actress Sydney Sweeney on social media. After Sweeney described the qualities she looks for in a partner including someone athletic and adventurous, he reposted the quote and replied, “Love skydiving.”The playful comment quickly went viral, generating millions of views and sparking speculation among fans. However, there was no public confirmation of any relationship, and the moment appeared to remain a lighthearted social media exchange.Soon after the Sweeney interaction, Nacua was spotted dining with influencer Hannah Stocking in West Hollywood. Photos of the pair leaving a restaurant together led to immediate speculation about a possible romance.Neither Nacua nor Stocking confirmed the rumors, and reports suggested the outing may have simply been casual. Still, the sighting reinforced the growing interest in the wide receiver’s off-field life.More recently, Nacua was seen at the Daytona 500 alongside WWE star Charlotte Flair, leading to fresh dating speculation. Fans started to wonder if they were dating when they saw them together in pictures and on social media.However, sources indicated the situation may have been misinterpreted, with some suggesting Flair appeared closer to Nacua’s brother during the event. As of now, no relationship has been officially confirmed.","Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua is one of the NFL’s rising stars.

Cooper Flagg’s debut jersey sets a new NBA auction benchmark

Victor Wembanyama’s record falls as the market accelerates

Basketball shoes and jerseys have generally only traded for five figures through NBA Auctions, but the market has officially taken a serious step up this week with Cooper Flagg's game-worn jersey from his professional debut selling for an incredible $1 million, a new record for the highest price a jersey has ever sold for via NBA Auctions. It broke the previous record of $762,000 for Victor Wembanyama's first jersey, which was sold in 2023, and shows that there is no shortage of people wanting to buy rookie memorabilia that will be remembered for years to come.Now one of the most expensive pieces of modern basketball memorabilia, the jersey was worn by Flagg in the first half of his NBA regular-season debut with the Dallas Mavericks. The finding underscores how a single moment, particularly one that's connected to the debut of a top prospect on the league's biggest stage, can transform the economics of sports memorabilia and offer clues to evolving collector preferences.On October 22, 2025, Cooper Flagg wore the record-setting jersey for his NBA debut against the San Antonio Spurs. The 19-year-old forward made his mark from the outset with 10 points and 10 rebounds in that game, showcasing the well-rounded talent that has made him one of the most highly touted rookies in years. The jersey was game-worn and photo-matched to the opening half of the contest, both features that elevate the price.Officials at the auction say that some collectors are more interested in pieces linked to specific ""firsts"" and ""first moments,"" and in particular, players whom they view as future franchise cornerstones. In a sport where only all-time legends can push memorabilia past seven figures, Flagg's early career appearances and marketability helped to drive the jersey's final price into seven-figure territory.The sale broke the previous record in NBA Auctions, which was for a San Antonio Spurs debut jersey for Victor Wembanyama that sold for $762,000 in 2023. Wembanyama's jersey was seen as modern memorabilia, but probably not at this scale, given the world's strong interest in the generational center. It is a tip of the hat to that inevitable upward trajectory in player and, in turn, collector confidence in elite young talent. Flagg’s jersey now represents that evolutionary next step in that trend.But in the eyes of industry observers, the increase from $762,000 to $1 million in only two years is another indicator of how fast the market is booming, particularly for items authenticated as game-worn, with provenance clearly established. Flagg’s sale has already had auction houses ready for a spike in future rookie-debut jerseys.","Cooper Flagg's game-worn debut jersey from his professional debut sold for an incredible $1 million.

Frank Martin reveals message to Anthony Joshua after fatal Nigeria crash and reflects on his own comeback journey

Frank Martin has shared an emotional message for Anthony Joshua during one of the hardest moments of the former heavyweight champion’s life. Joshua was involved in a fatal car crash in Nigeria on December 29, just ten days after his win over Jake Paul. While Joshua survived, two of his close friends and long-time team members, Kevin Latif “Latz” Ayodele and Sina Ghami, sadly lost their lives.The accident happened while Joshua was in Nigeria after Christmas celebrations. The boxing world quickly sent support as news spread. Now, Martin, who once trained alongside Joshua, has spoken openly about reaching out with his condolences during this painful time.Martin, 31, previously trained with Joshua, 36, under coach Derrick James in Dallas. Speaking to SunSport, Martin explained how he tried to contact Joshua after the tragic news.He said, “I reached out to him, but I didn’t get a response. But I reached out to some of the other guys who are around him and I sent my condolences to the friends and the families.”Joshua is still mourning the loss of his schoolfriend Latz and recovery therapist Ghami. Many fighters and fans across the world have continued to show support as he deals with the heartbreaking loss.Martin is also preparing for his own important fight. He returns to the ring on Saturday against Nahir Albright, live on DAZN PPV. The American super lightweight is focused but understands how quickly life can change.He was stopped by Gervonta Davis in 2024, a loss that many believed would slow him down. Instead, Martin moved up to 140 pounds in December and knocked out Rances Barthelemy in strong fashion.Looking back at that tough period, Martin said, “I feel like a lot of people counted me out. But I knew what was going on and with that fight and even outside of that, how I was gonna come back.”He added, “I’m not the type of fighter to take a loss and think it’s over for me. I gotta get back up. It’s like you gotta get back up, so I knew just me staying focused and getting back in the gym and fixing things to make myself better as a fighter.”While Martin prepares for his next bout, his thoughts remain with Joshua and the families affected. In boxing, strength is not only shown in the ring, but also in moments of grief and support.","Frank Martin sends heartfelt condolences to Anthony Joshua after tragic Nigeria car crash claims two close friends.

Former NFL player, Darron Lee, had fans looking up to him when he joined the league and then stepped away from the field completely in 2020.After spending a few years out of the spotlight, Darron Lee has dominated headlines over the last few weeks for all the wrong reasons. As Daron Lee faces first degree murder charges for the death of his girlfriend, it is now being reported that he initially lied to authorities.According to a recent report by News Channel 9, as per the arrest affidavit, investigators working on the case have revealed that first responders responded to what they assumed to be a CPR in progress at Darron Lee’s rented home in Tennessee.As soon as the authorities arrived, the woman was found dead.

Painful injury nearly ended Adele Nicoll’s Winter Olympics hopes



Adele Nicoll feared her Olympic dream had ended just five months ago after a frightening knee injury during training. The British athlete tore ligaments and could barely walk. Today, the 29-year-old is competing at the Winter Games in Cortina. She has qualified for the monobob and will also pilot the two-woman bobsleigh with former sprinter Ashleigh Nelson. Her recovery has surprised many, as she only recently stopped using crutches.Nicoll is also a three-time women’s shot put champion. Balancing summer and winter sports has made her journey unusual. She finished 18th in the monobob, becoming the first British athlete in that event. Despite the pain and long rehab, she says she now feels fully fit. The Welsh athlete is even considering competing in shot put at the upcoming Glasgow Commonwealth Games.Adele Nicoll explained that the accident happened during a track training run. Her new spikes stuck in the surface while her body kept moving forward, forcing her knee backward. She remembered shouting loudly at the moment of injury, saying the reaction came mainly from shock and fear that she would miss the Olympics rather than from the pain itself.The damage was severe. She suffered a ligament tear at the back of the knee, capsule damage, a small tibia fracture, bone bruising, and strains to both ACL and LCL. She could not put weight on the leg. For weeks she relied on a brace and crutches. Speaking to The Sun , she admitted the timing felt terrible and emotionally overwhelming, but she decided the only solution was total focus on recovery and disciplined daily decisions.Doctors warned her that rushing could create long-term problems, so the team chose a slow and careful plan. She said she is thankful for the support around her because proper rehab allowed her to arrive in Cortina healthy and ready.Nicoll believes her long-term future is in bobsleigh but still hopes to achieve as much as possible in both sports. She carefully manages body weight due to racing limits. She previously lost about 20 kilograms for bobsleigh and discovered her throwing distance improved because power mattered more than body mass. For now, she plans to continue both sports while staying strong and properly fuelled.","Adele Nicoll feared her Olympic dream had ended just five months ago.

How Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma are hurting India | T20 World Cup

Game on hai

Veteran Pakistan pacer Mohammad Amir has issued a stern warning to India opener Abhishek Sharma after the batter registered three consecutive ducks at the start of the T20 World Cup 2026. Before India’s high-profile clash with Pakistan last Sunday in Colombo, Amir had labelled Abhishek a “slogger,” and the batter’s early struggles have now drawn further scrutiny.In India’s final Group A match against the Netherlands on Wednesday, Abhishek fell on the third ball of the first over to Aryan Dutt. Trying to play a pull shot, he was beaten by the pace as the ball skidded through and hit the stumps. This dismissal marked his third duck in as many games, with just eight deliveries faced across the three matches.With this, Abhishek equalled the record for the most ducks by an Indian in T20 World Cups, joining Ashish Nehra. Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi and Sri Lanka’s Tillakaratne Dilshan top the overall list with five ducks each.Speaking on the Pakistani show, Amir drew parallels between Abhishek’s early struggles and those faced by Pakistan opener Saim Ayub during his initial PSL campaigns. He stressed that young batters are quickly tested by quality bowlers who spot technical flaws.“Saim had the same issue when he came to play the PSL a few years back. He was new and was hitting no-look shots. Nobody knew his weakness because most of his shots were on the leg side.Now, if you bowl at the third or fourth stump line, he struggles to decide. Even in his last two matches, he was dismissed playing on the off side. Unless he improves his off-side game, he cannot progress. Strong bowlers will always test your weakness and push you out of your comfort zone,” Amir said.He added specifically about Abhishek: “Same for Abhishek. He wants every ball in the slot so he can hit. But at the bigger stages, or in ODIs, har ball lapete mein nahi le sakte (you cannot slog every ball in pressure cricket). Salman Agha and Aryan Dutt got him out in similar fashion. International cricket will expose you.”India will be hoping that Abhishek overcomes this poor run of form and regains his rhythm ahead of the Super 8 stage of the tournament.",Mohammad Amir has warned India opener Abhishek Sharma. The batsman has registered three consecutive ducks at the T20 World Cup 2026. He was dismissed by Aryan Dutt on the third ball of the first over against the Netherlands.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128551573,imgsize-94334,width-400,resizemode-4/abhishek-sharma-joins-unwanted-list-after-registering-third-duck-in-t20-wc.jpg"

Tom Brady’s ‘not-that-serious’ fling suddenly sounds very intentional in new report

Timeline of Tom Brady and Alix Earle’s rumored romance and why fans are locked in

Tom Brady’s love life is back under the microscope, and this time it is a 25-year-old TikTok star at the center of it. The retired quarterback has been linked to influencer Alix Earle since they rang in 2026 at the same St. Barts yacht party, and the footage has not stopped surfacing since.Now a new report from Page Six says their “not-that-serious” fling might be more calculated than fans first thought. Sources told the outlet Brady is “very particular,” “intentional,” a “perfectionist” who “doesn’t hook up with just anyone,” which makes the choice to keep seeing Earle a lot more interesting than a random holiday rebound.According to Page Six, people in Brady’s circle insist he is still “having ‘fun’” with Earle and that the situation is “not-that-serious.” At the same time, those same sources describe him as “very particular,” “intentional,” a “perfectionist” who “doesn’t hook up with just anyone.” For a 48-year-old who guards his image, that is not casual language.The two first popped up together over New Year’s in St. Barts. Spies told Page Six they met at a yacht party, spent “a lot of the night” talking, then broke away from the group to continue the conversation in a private cabin.Later, fans shared video of them swaying near the DJ booth, with Earle leaning in to whisper in his ear while her hand rested on his back.Earle called the getaway “really fun” and the “best trip of [her] entire life.” In an Instagram post from the same trip, she joked about the rumors and wrote, “Rumor has it we’re still dancing 🕺🕺 new friends, new memories, and new beginnings to start off the new year :) words can’t describe how amazing this trip was, so grateful to @bgarlinghouse & @taragarlinghouse for hosting us & @managermyles for throwing the best nye party EVER. ”Her family even played into the headlines. In a TikTok, her dad, Thomas “TJ” Earle, said he bought a blazer “because [he] saw Tom Brady wearing one like that,” while her stepmom, Ashley Dupré, called the comment “ironic” and laughed that he says “the darndest things.” Reps for both Brady and Earle did not respond to Page Six when asked about the situation.The New Year’s yacht party was the start, but it was not the end. The pair were spotted again over Super Bowl weekend in San Francisco earlier this month, where cameras caught them dancing closely at a party. In the clip, the former New England Patriots star smiled and chatted with the Dancing With the Stars alum as they moved together on the dance floor, which only intensified talk that this is an ongoing thing, not a one-off.The buzz around Brady’s dating life comes while he is still very public about being a single dad. On Feb. 14, he posted a Valentine’s Day tribute to his three children on Instagram and wrote, “Jack, Benny and Vivi…My forever valentines! Love you three so much and the awesome adventures we get to share together. From the court to the slopes to everywhere in between, you make all my days brighter! Loving these Swiss slopes! Just missing you Jack. ”Brady finalized his divorce from Gisele Bündchen in October 2022. He shares Jack “Edward” Thomas Moynahan, born in 2007, with ex-girlfriend Bridget Moynahan, and two younger children, Benjamin Rein and Vivian Lake, with Bündchen. Earle, meanwhile, had her own NFL tie before this. Her split from Houston Texans wide receiver Braxton Berrios was confirmed in December 2025 after a two-year relationship.Earlier coverage, including reporting that Brady was “hooking up” with Earle just days after a viral Super Bowl party clip, set the tone. The new Page Six details shift the framing. If a man who “doesn’t hook up with just anyone” keeps showing up in the same room, on the same dance floor, and in the same rumors with the same woman, fans are going to read more into it.",The retired quarterback has been linked to influencer Alix Earle since they rang in 2026 at the same St. Barts yacht party.

Connor Hellebuyck leads United States national team past Sweden in overtime



The US national team beat the Sweden national team in one of the most dramatic NHL games of the Olympic tournament. It was a close overtime battle. Goaltender Connor Hellebuyck was the most important player in the game. He played calmly and with authority, which helped the Americans stay calm during a tense elimination game at the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics.As the quarterfinals approached, conversations about NHL news and tournament form centered on whether Team USA could deal with Sweden's structured play and pressure in the late game. Instead, the Americans set the pace for most of the game by playing strong defense and offense at the right times. The result not only put the team in the semifinals, but it also gave them more faith in their depth and ability to bounce back.Connor Hellebuyck made 28 of 29 saves, giving the United States a strong performance that kept them in the game. The veteran goalie came into the tournament with questions about his ability to play well in the playoffs, but he came through when it mattered most, showing sharp positioning and confidence against a persistent Swedish attack.Dylan Larkin scored the first goal of the second period, giving the Americans an early lead with a well-timed setup. Sweden scored late in the game when Mika Zibanejad scored with an extra attacker on the ice. This tied the game and sent it to overtime. Even though the other team scored, Team USA quickly took back control in the extra frame.Quinn Hughes scored the game-winning goal in overtime, beating Jacob Markstrom with a wrist shot. Matt Boldy and Auston Matthews helped him. Overall, the Americans had more shots than Sweden and limited dangerous chances late in the game, showing that their defense was better.","The US national team beat the Sweden national team in one of the most dramatic NHL games of the Olympic tournament.

T20 World Cup | Shivam Dube press conference after India beat Netherlands

Shivam Dube said guidance from former India captain MS Dhoni helped shape his batting approach after he played a match-winning 67-run knock in the last group-stage match of the T20 World Cup against Netherlands at the Narendra Modi Stadium on Wednesday.Dube said he had struggled against pace bowling early in his career, but advice from Dhoni on strike rotation and controlled intent helped him improve in pressure situations.""When I first came into the IPL, I struggled against fast bowlers and wasn’t striking the ball cleanly. I realised that if I want to dominate at this level and I have the power, I needed to work on that aspect. I put in significant effort during the off-season. Mahi bhai told me that it’s not necessary to hit sixes every time. Boundaries and strike rotation are equally important.""That clarity has helped me. If I get a good ball, I look for a boundary or rotate strike. In the death overs, I will naturally go harder, but early in the innings, my focus is on smart intent,"" Dube told Jio Hotstar, as cited by news agency IANS.Speaking about pressure situations, Dube said his focus is on batting according to the match scenario and staying till the end if required.“I don’t feel pressure; I focus on the situation. If wickets fall, my responsibility is to bat deep. If I stay till the end, I know I can add 10–15 crucial runs in the final over. I avoid taking unnecessary risks in the middle overs. If the situation demands stability, I rotate strike. If the platform is set, I’m ready to attack from the first ball,” he said.Dube walked in to bat when India were 69 for 3 after nine overs and stabilised the innings with a 66-run knock off 31 balls.He also contributed with the ball, taking two wickets for 35 runs in three overs. For his all-round performance, he was named player of the match.",Shivam Dube said guidance from MS Dhoni helped shape his batting approach.

Mitch Marner’s OT goal saves Canada against Czechia | Digital Sportscentre

Mitch Marner came through in the clutch, scoring the overtime winner to propel Team Canada to a thrilling 4-3 victory over Team Czechia in the Olympic quarterfinals. The high-pressure finish not only propelled Canada into the semifinals but also sparked renewed talk about Mitch Marner’s big-game reputation and whether he is still living under the shadow of criticism related to his NHL market.As for the game itself, it was a roller coaster ride. Macklin Celebrini started off the scoring with a setup from Connor McDavid, but Czechia quickly responded with a goal from Lukas Sedlak. A power-play goal from David Pastrnak put Canada on its heels before Nathan MacKinnon tied the game in the second period. Czechia struck again in the third with a goal from Ondrej Palat, setting up a wild finish. With minutes left, Nick Suzuki sent the game to overtime, setting up Marner’s heroics.Canada entered the game as heavy favorites following a dominant performance in the preliminary round. When Mitch Marner scored just over a minute into overtime, the goal was an instant classic and one of the most memorable moments of the tournament to date.Following the game, teammate Mark Stone suggested that lingering criticism of Marner is due to his NHL market, suggesting that there is a “Toronto thing” at play.After the game, he said, “As a teammate, I haven’t experienced that. 4Nations, gets a huge OT goal for us, makes an incredible play for the winner. Then tonight, when we need him the most, he makes the play. So, um … I think it’s a Toronto thing.” The comment went viral.Marner has consistently delivered in elimination games, including overtime winners in previous international competitions. Teammate Brandon Hagel supported this view, praising Marner for proving his doubters wrong on the international stage. “I thought he wasn’t a big-game player? He just showed the world,"" he said.Marner himself has accepted the importance of this goal, saying that it is probably the biggest one that he has scored so far in his career and that his team is still on the path to win the ultimate prize of gold. “Yeah, probably; it’s hard not to say it isn’t,” he said. “Obviously, it’s a do-or-die game and one of the biggest tournaments of your life. So, yeah, it’d be cool to, you know, after this tournament, look back on something like that, but we got some work still to do. ”The Canadian team is ready to face Team Finland in the semifinals on Friday, February 20, with all eyes on Marner. If he continues to perform this well under the pressure of the Olympics, then the discussion about his legacy will finally change from one of uncertainty to one of dominance.",Mitch Marner scored the overtime winner to propel Team Canada to a thrilling 4-3 victory over Team Czechia in the Olympic quarterfinals.

Olympic wrestling gold medalist Gable Steveson returns to action Thursday in the MFL 3 main event in Mexico. The 25-year-old heavyweight will compete in just his third professional MMA bout. Despite his limited experience, many fans already see him as a possible future star who could bring a big boost to the struggling heavyweight division. Steveson has dominated his first two opponents quickly, finishing both fights in under three minutes combined.The UFC heavyweight scene has recently drawn criticism for a shortage of new contenders.

He believes pressure is a part of the preparation and says it motivates him to keep achieving success and rewards.He said that he respects the current heavyweight fighters but feels confident in his own strengths, including speed, timing, youth, and power. According to him, his goal is simply to follow his path and perform without speaking negatively about others.He also expressed gratitude for the faith people have put in him since years. He noted that he works hard daily, stays disciplined, and believes that dedication will bring results.Steveson added that his rapid rise was expected due to his reputation and support team. He thinks fans have not yet seen his full potential and he has much more to show in his future fights.“I feel I’ve put in a lot of great work, I put in a lot of great time and I have a lot of good people around me to kind of guide that path. It was inevitable that it was going to be this quick. With the name, with the stature that I come with, it was going to happen. You’ve just got to put on a good show for the people and kind of let them enjoy and let them soak it in on who you can bel”, Steveson said.Finally, he stated that he is focused only on Thursday’s bout. After the fight, he will evaluate opportunities, including a possible UFC call, once he returns home.","Olympic gold medalist Gable Steveson returns to action Thursday in the MFL 3 main event in Mexico.

Edmonton Oilers Olympic break roster changes explained before NHL season resumes



The Edmonton Oilers took advantage of the Olympic break to make big changes to their roster and coaching staff before the National Hockey League season started up again, and after a string of inconsistent performances before the break, the organization worked on making its defense stronger and giving its lineup more options.As the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics come to an end, people are once again focusing on the NHL schedule and playoff positions. The Edmonton Oilers, with star forward Leon Draisaitl and captain Connor McDavid, are trying to get back on track after some recent problems.One of the most notable NHL updates involves franchise legend Paul Coffey returning to the Edmonton Oilers coaching staff to assist head coach Kris Knoblauch. Coffey previously worked closely with the defensive unit, and his return is viewed as an effort to address the team’s recent defensive inconsistencies, including struggles on the penalty kill and goals against.The Edmonton Oilers also reassigned goaltender Calvin Pickard to their American Hockey League affiliate, the Bakersfield Condors, after carrying multiple goaltenders created roster challenges. This move provides additional flexibility while keeping Pickard ready if injuries or performance issues arise later in the season.Additionally, rookie forward Matt Savoie was sent to the Bakersfield Condors as part of a salary-cap adjustment, especially with veteran forward Adam Henrique expected to return from long-term injured reserve. Because Savoie can move without waivers, the decision allowed the organization to manage roster space efficiently.These changes show that the Edmonton Oilers are focused on improving their structure. Also, on consistency as the NHL season picks up again. While rumors about NHL trades are still going around, they suggest that more trades could happen before the playoff race heats up.","The Edmonton Oilers took advantage of the Olympic break to make big changes to their roster and coaching staff.

Jon Cooper remains positive about Sidney Crosby’s return in the semifinals



Team Canada was able to win yesterday’s quarterfinal game narrowly thanks to an overtime goal by Mitch Marner. But Canada and Pittsburgh didn’t have a lot to celebrate. A bad hit from the Czechs caused Penguins captain Sidney Crosby to visibly leave the game in pain.But while fans remained worried for his health, he remains a possibility for Canada's Olympic semifinal against Finland despite leaving Wednesday's quarterfinal with a lower-body injury. As per head coach Jon Cooper, he still remains a fixture for Friday’s game.Cooper confirmed Thursday that Crosby has by no means been ruled out for Friday's medal-round matchup at Milano Cortina 2026. Crosby exited Canada's 4-3 overtime victory over Czechia midway through the second period after landing awkwardly on his right leg.The 38-year-old attempted to avoid a hit from Czech defenseman Radko Gudas by ducking low. He briefly returned for another shift before leaving the ice again and did not return to action. The injury occurred during a crucial moment in Canada's quarterfinal at Santagiulia Arena.Crosby's absence for the final period and overtime left Canada without its captain as Mitch Marner scored the game-winning goal 82 seconds into the extra frame.Cooper provided measured optimism when addressing Crosby's status on Thursday.The Tampa Bay Lightning bench boss emphasized player safety while keeping the door open for his captain's return against the defending Olympic champions. ""We're not going to put anyone in harm's way,"" Cooper told reporters. ""But if he can play, he's definitely going to. We'll know more again in 24 hours.""The head coach's comments suggest Crosby's availability remains uncertain heading into Friday's semifinal. Canada will make a game-time decision on whether the three-time Stanley Cup champion can contribute against Finland's formidable roster.Crosby's potential absence creates significant challenges for Canada's gold medal aspirations. The Penguins veteran has 15 career Olympic points and captured gold medals in 2010 and 2014. His leadership and two-way play remain integral to Canada's success at Milano Cortina 2026.Pittsburgh also breathes easier knowing Crosby avoided a serious injury that could derail their playoff push. The Penguins captain leads his team with 59 points through 56 games this season. He remains on pace to extend his NHL record for consecutive seasons averaging at least one point per game.Pittsburgh sits second in the Metropolitan Division with 26 games remaining after the Olympic break. The Penguins won seven of their final 10 contests before NHL players departed for Italy. They return to action on February 26, hosting the New Jersey Devils at PPG Paints Arena as they pursue their first playoff berth since 2023.",Sidney Crosby left Wednesday's quarterfinal with a lower-body injury.

Taylor Swift’s quiet UK trip lines up neatly with Brit Awards week

Where Travis Kelce and Harry Styles change the stakes

Taylor Swift is back in headlines without playing a note. She has quietly flown into the UK ahead of the 2026 Brit Awards in Manchester, and fans have jumped to the same question: will this be her first big red carpet with fiancé Travis Kelce and ex Harry Styles in the building?Here is what is actually on the record. British reports say Swift is lying low in London before heading to Manchester’s Co-op Live arena, where the Brits take place on Feb. 28, with her team scheduled to leave the UK the Monday after. She is nominated for International Artist of the Year and International Song of the Year for “The Fate of Ophelia,” just after the IFPI named her 2025’s biggest-selling global artist again. There is still no official word on a performance or on whether Kelce will join her.The Sun first reported that Swift arrived in the UK this week with a large entourage and plans to visit Manchester in the days before the show. A music-industry source told the outlet, “Taylor is hiding out in London at the moment and is scheduled to visit Manchester, which seems like she could be lined up for a surprise appearance at the Brit Awards.”That same source said organizers are trying to keep plans quiet but admitted it “feels too much like a coincidence that Taylor is secretly in the UK at the exact time of the Brits.” With two Brit nominations tied to “The Fate of Ophelia” and a new IFPI crown off The Life of a Showgirl, a short Brit Awards appearance fits her week on paper.Kelce’s situation is straightforward. The Kansas City Chiefs’ season is over and there is no football conflict if he wants to be in Manchester. A joint appearance at the Brits would turn a normal awards night into the engaged couple’s first major red carpet of 2026.Styles is the wildcard. Swift’s former partner is also expected at the ceremony, and British tabloids are already pushing the idea of the ex and the fiancé under one roof. Swift has worked next to exes and rivals for years, so one more polite backstage encounter is unlikely to change her plans. For cameras and social feeds, though, a Swift-Kelce entrance with Styles somewhere in the arena is exactly the kind of scene that keeps replaying.",Taylor Swift has flown into the UK ahead of the 2026 Brit Awards in Manchester.

Ben Loomis continues jump after leaf blower strike as Team USA finishes seventh

A shocking moment unfolded on the Olympic slopes, and Team USA skier Ben Loomis was at the center of it. The 27-year-old athlete narrowly avoided a serious injury when a misplaced leaf blower struck him just before a jump. The incident happened during the Nordic Combined Team Sprint event at the Winter Olympics in Milano Cortina, where harsh weather had already made conditions difficult.Heavy snowfall and blizzard-like winds forced officials to use leaf blowers to clear snow between jumps. But in a split second, one blower stayed in Loomis’ path as he rushed down the hill at high speed. What followed left commentators stunned and fans holding their breath. Somehow, Loomis kept control, completed his jump, and avoided disaster.The scary scene quickly became one of the most talked-about moments of the event. Even though no major injury occurred, the close call raised serious safety concerns and drew an apology from officials.As Loomis sped toward the 120-meter drop, most workers quickly moved their equipment away. One blower, however, remained too close. Loomis crashed through it, and the machine hit his shoulder just before takeoff.Despite the impact, he stayed focused and completed the jump as planned.Commentator Peter Jonsson reacted with concern, saying, “Geez, it could have ended in horror.” Loomis later explained the moment calmly. He said, “I’ve never experienced anything like this. Fortunately, it happened at the top, so I just tried to convince myself to make a good jump.” He added, “Luckily it only hit my shoulder. If it had hit me in the face, it would have been a completely different story.”Competition director Lasse Ottesen admitted the mistake and issued an apology. He said, “It is very regrettable that we had an incident with Loomis. It was good that nothing more happened, but it should not happen. The person has apologized to the jury and FIS apologizes to the USA.”Loomis competed alongside teammate Niclas Malacinski, and their combined score placed Team USA seventh after the ski jumping round.

Synthetic aperture radar used to map subsurface features beneath the Pyramid of Khafre



Claims generate online interest and academic caution



Natural caves already exist beneath the Giza Plateau



Speculation links findings to ancient myths and older cultures





Reports emerging in March 2025 have drawn attention to fresh claims about hidden structures beneath the Pyramid of Khafre on the Giza plateau. An Italy-based research group, working with satellite radar imagery rather than ground excavation, says it has identified large underground features extending deep below the monument. The team used Synthetic Aperture Radar data gathered from orbiting satellites and processed it to produce composite images of subsurface density. Their interpretation points to vertical shafts and sizable chambers cut into the bedrock. The findings have not been verified through an on-site investigation. For now, they remain part of an ongoing debate about remote sensing methods, data interpretation and the long-studied geology of the Giza plateau in Egypt.The researchers relied on Synthetic Aperture Radar, often shortened to SAR. This technology sends radar signals from satellites in orbit. The signals reflect off the ground and are recorded, then processed using mathematical modelling. Variations in density and structure can appear as patterns in the final images.Based on this study, “What Really Lies Beneath the Pyramids?” , the team believes it can see eight deep cylindrical shafts beneath the pyramid.These are said to descend hundreds of metres into the limestone bedrock. At the lower end, the images appear to show two large cubic chambers. Inside the pyramid itself, five vertical voids are also suggested. It is an interpretation of patterns rather than a physical survey.The announcement moved quickly across social media platforms. Alternative history commentators gave it prominence. Videos and commentary circulated widely within days.Academic reaction has been more restrained. Egyptologists point out that satellite radar imagery can be complex. Image processing may produce shapes that resemble structures without confirming their material nature. Without drilling, excavation or ground-penetrating surveys, it is difficult to establish what lies below.The Giza plateau is not solid stone throughout. Limestone bedrock in the area contains natural cavities and fissures. Some caves have been explored in previous decades. Earlier geophysical surveys also detected voids in certain areas beneath the pyramids.Because of this, some researchers suggest the radar signatures could represent natural formations rather than engineered shafts. The difference matters. Geological voids are common in limestone terrain. The present claims do not yet clearly separate between natural and artificial origins.Beyond the technical dispute, some authors have made similarities between the suggested structures and the Duat, the nether region mentioned in funerary texts in ancient Egypt. Others go further and propose connections to Taş Tepeler-related prehistoric sites in Anatolia. These connections are yet theoretical. There is currently no archaeological evidence linking those previous cultures to the Giza plateau. For the time being, the radar investigation broadens the debate about Khafre's pyramid. It doesn't resolve the issue.","Italy-based research group says it has identified large underground features extending deep below the monument.
