LaMelo Ball‚Äôs influence on the Charlotte Hornets squad

How to watch tonight‚Äôs game between the Charlotte Hornets and the Los Angeles Lakers (February 19, 2025)?

Theface a challenging matchup against the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday, February 19, at Crypto.com Arena, with star guard LaMelo Ball listed as probable due to an ankle injury. Ball‚Äôs availability remains a key storyline as the Hornets, already struggling with a 13-39 record, look to compete against a Lakers squad fighting for playoff positioning. LaMelo Ball , who leads the Charlotte Hornets with 27.3 points per game, has been a bright spot in an otherwise difficult season for Charlotte. His ankle issue has raised concerns, but the ""probable"" designation suggests he is likely to suit up. However, his effectiveness on the court could be limited, especially against a Lakers team known for its defensive intensity.The Hornets are already without several key players, including Brandon Miller (wrist) and Grant Williams (ACL), both ruled out for the season. Tre Mann (back) and Josh Okogie (hamstring) are also sidelined, further depleting Charlotte‚Äôs roster. Mark Williams, listed as probable for personal reasons, is expected to play, providing some relief in the frontcourt.For the Lakers, LeBron James is questionable with a foot injury, adding another layer of uncertainty to the game. James has been instrumental for Los Angeles, averaging 24.3 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. His potential absence could level the playing field, but the Lakers still boast depth with players like Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura stepping up in recent weeks.The Charlotte Hornets ‚Äô struggles are evident in their -287 scoring differential, ranking 28th in the league with 106.3 points per game. LaMelo Ball‚Äôs ability to create offense, both for himself and his teammates, will be crucial if Charlotte hopes to pull off an upset. His 4.0 three-pointers per game lead the team, and his playmaking could exploit a Lakers defense that allows 112.5 points per contest.Fans can catch the game live on SportsNet LA and FDSSE or stream it on Fubo, with regional restrictions potentially applying. As the Charlotte Hornets navigate a season marred by injuries, LaMelo Ball‚Äôs performance‚Äîand health‚Äîwill remain under the spotlight.Also read: Why are the Los Angeles Lakers and Charlotte Hornets playing today?

‚Äô status for the‚Äô upcoming game against the Charlotte Hornets remains uncertain as he is listed as questionable due to a foot injury. The Lakers, holding a 32-20 record, are set to face the struggling Hornets (13-39) at Crypto.com Arena on Wednesday, February 19, at 10:00 PM ET. James‚Äô potential absence could significantly impact the Lakers‚Äô performance, as he continues to be a cornerstone of the team‚Äôs success. LeBron James , averaging 24.4 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 8.6 assists over the last 20 games, is not only the Los Angeles Lakers‚Äô leading scorer but also their top rebounder and playmaker. His ability to dominate both ends of the floor has been crucial for Los Angeles, which ranks 14th in the league with 113.3 points per game. Without him, the team‚Äôs offensive rhythm and defensive presence could take a hit, especially against a Hornets squad that, despite their poor record, has shown resilience in certain areas.The Lakers‚Äô injury report also includes Maxi Kleber, who is out with a foot injury. Kleber‚Äôs absence further depletes the team‚Äôs depth, putting additional pressure on role players like Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura to step up. Reaves, averaging 20.2 points and 6.9 assists in the last 20 games, has been a reliable secondary option, but the Lakers‚Äô chances of securing a win would undoubtedly be higher with LeBron James on the court.On the Hornets‚Äô side, LaMelo Ball is listed as probable with an ankle injury, providing a glimmer of hope for Charlotte. Ball, averaging 27.3 points per game, is the Hornets‚Äô leading scorer and a key facilitator.

superstarhad a blunt message for Charles Barkley during NBA All-Star Weekend . In a candid moment at the criticism-riddled event, Antetokounmpo hilariously made it clear that the Hall of Famer‚Äôs opinions about today‚Äôs game do not matter much as Barkley did not have to face French powerhouseand other top stars in the league. Charles Barkley was a dominant force in the NBA during the prime of his career and has built a second career as a popular but outspoken TV analyst. However, during Sunday‚Äôs All-Star Game festivities, Giannis Antetokounmpo jokingly pointed out that Barkley never had to face the kind of talent seen in today‚Äôs league.The moment came while Barkley was coaching the Global Stars ‚Äî a team featuring some of the NBA‚Äôs best international players, including Antetokounmpo. As players warmed up, cameras captured an interesting exchange between the two, later shared by journalist Kris Pursiainen on X (formerly Twitter).Antetokounmpo used the opportunity to highlight how drastically the game has changed, particularly with the emergence of unique talents like San Antonio Spurs rookie Victor Wembanyama . ‚ÄúBack in the day, you couldn‚Äôt guard him,‚Äù Giannis told Barkley, referring to Wembanyama‚Äôs dominance in the league.

You never faced something like this.‚Äù The Bucks star then pointed to Wembanyama and two-time MVP Nikola Jokiƒá , stating, ‚ÄúI gotta face him, I gotta face him. This is what I gotta deal with.‚ÄùThe All-Star Game also saw the 30-tear-old forward share a lighthearted moment with Wembanyama, who had an unusual role in the exhibition. Despite being one of the most highly anticipated young players in the league, the Spurs' 7-foot-3 rookie started both of his All-Star matches on the bench.Antetokounmpo also went to take his mocking game further and this time it was directed to Wembanyama. ‚ÄúBrother, you will never come off the bench in your career,‚Äù he told the French phenom. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?

Jose Quintana's 2024 performance makes him a likely choice



A logical move for the Mets



The New York Mets might be on the cusp of signing veteran lefty Jose Quintana following a premature injury to Frankie Montas. The righty will miss several weeks with a lat strain, creating a vital void in the Mets' rotation. Given the pitching depth concerns, pundits forecast the team to sign Quintana to a one-year, $12 million contract to solidify their staff.The New York Mets started the 2025 season with optimism following an active offseason, but the Frankie Montas injury has presented an early test. Montas, who was slated to be a major contributor in the rotation, is out indefinitely, making the Mets reassess their pitching depth.With Montas gone, the staff now has to rely on Kodai Senga, recently converted starter Clay Holmes, and less tested arms such as Paul Blackburn and Griffin Canning. This doubt has fueled speculation that the front office will return to Jose Quintana, an experienced pitcher who gave decent performances for the Mets in 2024.In his previous stint with the New York Mets, Jose Quintana posted a 10-10 record with a 3.75 ERA across 31 starts, logging 170 1/3 innings. His reliability and experience made him a key asset, especially in the postseason. Quintana was instrumental in the Mets‚Äô National League Division Series (NLDS) Game 4 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, helping the team advance to the National League Championship Series (NLCS).At 36, Quintana is not a long-term answer, but his stability could be just what the Mets require as they get through the early stages of the season without Montas.The New York Mets are viewed as solid contenders for 2025, but the depth of their pitching is still a concern. Having Jose Quintana back not only would be a veteran's presence but would keep the rotation competitive while Frankie Montas is recovering.Since a decent one-year, $12 million contract is forecast, this signing now appears more plausible. If the Mets wish to prevent early-season woes, the reunion with Quintana might prove the safest and wisest option.Also Read: MLB Icon Dusty Baker sees shades of Hall of Famer Pop Lloyd in Francisco Lindor","The New York Mets might be on the cusp of signing veteran lefty Jose Quintana.

India's probable XI vs Bangladesh:

Hot favourites India will begin their Champions Trophy campaign against Bangladesh in Group A on Thursday, and with just four teams in each group of the eight-team competition, every game matters in the quest to finish in the top two to qualify for the semifinals.Besides Bangladesh, India's other competitors in the group are hosts and defending champions Pakistan as well as New Zealand.India, who will play all their matches in Dubai, have the advantage of playing the entire tournament at just one venue and the players won't have to adjust to different pitches, unlike the other seven teams who will play across four venues -- Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi in Pakistan as well as Dubai.But the first match remains tricky. Despite knowing the historical nature of the Dubai track to have something in it for both batters and bowlers, India will have to take a call on whether to go in with three spinners or three pacers from their spin-heavy 15-member squad.India suffered a blow just before the tournament, with ace fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah ruled out because of a back injury. And with Mohammed Shami only recently returning to the team after a year-long injury layoff and Arshdeep Singh short on ODI experience, India coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Rohit Sharma have work to do in order to pick the bowling combination they want to go ahead with.India have as many as five spinners in the squad; namely Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, and all-rounders Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Washington Sundar. While the pace-bowling unit has Harshit Rana and all-rounder Hardik Pandya besides Shami and Arshdeep.The dew expected late in the evening in Dubai is one factor that may prevent India from picking three spinners as it makes it difficult to grip the dewy ball. But with Axar being used at No. 5 against England and doing well, his inclusion can give India the balance they seek with a left-handed batting option in the mix in top five.However, the batting order looks sorted as the likes of Rohit, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul pick themselves, unless the think-tank wants Rishabh Pant to do the wicketkeeping duties instead of Rahul, who did the job during the three-match ODI series against England just before the Champions Trophy.Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, KL Rahul (wk), Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh","India begin their Champions Trophy campaign against Bangladesh in Group A on Thursday.

The build-up to the return of the Champions Trophy after more than seven years has been nothing short of dramatic, but the three-week entertainment is finally set to begin with things settling in time for the action on the field to begin with the opening game between hosts Pakistan and New Zealand today, February 19.The competition will witness eight teams competing at four venues. India's matches are scheduled in Dubai, while the remaining fixtures are set for Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi in Pakistan, which returns to hosting an International Cricket Council (ICC) event for the first time since they co-hosted the 1996 World Cup.The 2017 winners Pakistan are also the defending champions.The tournament's organisation, following an eight-year gap, required overcoming numerous challenges. It holds particular significance amidst ongoing discussions about the position of ODIs in the current cricket world.No recent cricket tournament has faced such significant challenges stemming from geopolitical conflicts, rigid stances by two key participating cricket boards (India and Pakistan) and concerns about venue preparedness in the official host nation.The first match presents an intriguing contest -- an unpredictable yet skilful Pakistan squad facing New Zealand, an opponent that prioritises systematic approach above all else.Also See: IND vs PAK Match Date and Time However, the tournament's most anticipated encounter arrives on February 23 when India clash with Pakistan, bringing forth the usual surge of memories, sentiments, political statements and online discourse.This high-profile encounter will take place in Dubai, as India maintained its firm stance against travelling to Pakistan, citing safety issues.Beyond team dynamics, certain players aim to make this tournament a defining moment in their careers -- and none among them is bigger than Indian legends Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.Their accomplishments and influence in contemporary cricket remain unparalleled. Now, as these two outstanding players approach the culmination of their illustrious careers, they aspire to conclude on a triumphant note.Regardless of the results, it seems unlikely that Kohli and Rohit will continue in India's ODI framework post the Champions Trophy . But nothing of that sort can be said with certainty despite the two already bidding adieu to the T20Is after the T20 World Cup last year.A fitting farewell tribute for Kohli and Rohit would coincide with the emergence of promising talents like Shubman Gill, who are poised to lead India's next cricketing generation.But a subpar performance in this tournament could jeopardise their likely desire to continue playing Tests, potentially prompting selectors to reassess their positions before India's tour of England in June.Failing to secure the Champions Trophy could place India's head coach Gautam Gambhir's position under review.Though India's recent victory over England in T20Is and ODIs at home offered Gambhir some breathing space, it cannot overshadow the team's struggles against New Zealand and Australia.However, clinching a global trophy would significantly strengthen his position.For the team as a whole, India aim to secure their first ICC trophy in the 50-over format since their 2013 Champions Trophy victory under Mahendra Singh Dhoni.India are pooled alongside Pakistan, New Zealand and Bangladesh. The 2013 winners will face Bangladesh on February 19, Pakistan on February 23 and New Zealand on March 2.Despite fading from cricket's spotlight recently, they remain capable of springing a surprise and can't be treated lightly or considered as pushovers.India's neighbours and arch-rivals must maintain composure and resilience during crucial moments. The host nation could prove formidable if they avoid focusing just on their match against India and stop viewing it as the ultimate challenge. Their bowling unit excels in pace, while batters such as Fakhar Zaman and Salman Ali Agha possess the ability to dominate opposition attacks.The Kiwis enter a different phase after Trent Boult and Tim Southee's departure. Kane Williamson remains their key player, and they are banking on his performance to secure their first ICC white-ball title despite consistent show in ICC tournaments across formats over the years.Despite the absence of their leading fast bowlers Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, the Aussies remain formidable. The two-time champions possess a batting lineup well-suited to the ODI format's requirements.Previously dominant in limited-overs cricket, England have experienced a decline as several key players grapple with advancing years and diminishing performance levels. But they have a nice mix of youth and experience with Joe Root and Jos Buttler there to guide the likes of Harry Brook or Ben Duckett.The team, under Temba Bavuma's leadership, seeks to change the so-near-yet-so-far pattern. They reached the T20 World Cup final before losing to India in a dramatic finish to the final in Barbados last year and would want to build on that in the longer version of the two white-ball formats.The Afghans have evolved into a strong limited-overs side, capable of challenging any team with players like Rashid Khan and Rahmanullah Gurbaz in their ranks.",Champions Trophy returns for the first time in more than seven years. India play Pakistan in the opening match in Dubai on February 19. The three-week competition will see eight teams compete at four venues. India aim to secure their first ICC trophy in the 50-over format since 2013.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118373212,imgsize-67274,width-400,resizemode-4/118373212.jpg"

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee ‚Äî Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match ‚Äî before the Nagpur ODI ‚Äî more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‚ÄòHitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

""I think his game is meant for the playoffs, like the guy can bunt, he doesn't strike out a ton. He walks less and he gives you good at-bats. These are all things that championship ballclubs have, they've players like that on their team. I think that's what he is to this franchise,""

Champions Trophy: Pant's trademark no-look sixes and Iyer's clean hits steal the show

Mohammad Amir Exclusive: Champions Trophy hopes, India's absence & retirement talk

NEW DELHI: Self-discipline was the foundation of Mahendra Singh Dhoni 's illustrious cricketing career, and the legendary former India captain continues to uphold the same principles even after retirement. It is this disciplined approach to life that he wishes to instill in young cricketers.Dhoni bid farewell to international cricket in August 2020, concluding a remarkable career that included triumphs in the ICC T20 World Cup (2007), ICC Men‚Äôs ODI World Cup (2011), and the 2013 Champions Trophy.Speaking at an event on Wednesday, Dhoni reflected on his mindset during his playing days.‚ÄúYou always need to figure out what is good for you. When I was playing, I made sure that cricket was a whole for me ‚Äî nothing else mattered. What time I had to sleep? What time I had to get up? What impact it had on (my) cricket, that was the most important thing.‚ÄúYou know, all the friendships, the fun, all those can happen later. There is a right time for everything and I felt if you are able to recognise that, that's the best thing you can do (for yourself), For me as a cricketer, I always wanted to perform for the Indian cricket team because I've said that in the past also, that not everybody gets a chance to represent the country,‚Äù‚ÄúFor us as cricketers, whenever we went on to the big stage or whenever we were touring, there was a chance for us to win laurels for the country and so for me it was the country that always came first,"" said Dhoni at an event at which the mobile app ‚ÄòDhoni‚Äô was unveiled.Despite having retired from international cricket, Dhoni still continues to wins the hearts of all cricket lovers in the Indian Premier League where he plays for the Chennai Super Kings When asked about his life post retirement, Dhoni said, ‚ÄúI've retired since 2019, so it will be quite some time. What I've been doing in the meantime is I just want to enjoy cricket for the last, whatever few years, you know, I will be able to play,‚ÄùHe said cricket is still a part of his life but he wants to enjoy it as he used to to as a child.‚ÄúI want to enjoy it, how I did as a child when I was in school. When I lived in a colony, 4 o'clock (in the afternoon) was sports time, so we'll go and play cricket more often than not. But if the weather doesn't permit, we used to play football. I want to play with the same kind of innocence‚Ä¶ (but it is) easier said than done,‚Äù he added.",Mahendra Singh Dhoni says self-discipline was the foundation of his career. The former India captain continues to uphold the same principles even after retirement. Dhoni will retire from international cricket in August 2020.

(Getty Images)

Time to make up for past heartbreaks

DUBAI: At your hotel, the waiter, hailing from Bangladesh, requests you for a match ticket. Another request comes in the moment you hop into the cab, as the driver also happens to be from Bangladesh.The outfield at the state-of-the-art Dubai International Cricket Stadium looks even more lush green, while the 'Ring of Fire' -the LED lights look set to shine in full glow. The ICC volunteers are going through the usual drill of displaying the national flags of India and Bangladesh, the workers are busy giving the finishing touches to the painted ads on the ground, while the groundsmen are giving the pitch one final roll. After enjoying complete rest on Tuesday, India chose to train at the stadium on Wednesday evening at a venue which has by now become familiar to them, while Bangladesh practiced at the ICC Academy.All in all, the Dubai leg of the 2025 Champions Trophy looks set to kick off on Thursday when India, who remain the tournament favourites despite the absence of talismanic pacer Jasprit Bumrah in their ranks, take on an unpredictable, but tricky Bangladesh, in a group A match. Put simply, for the 2023 ODI World Cup finalists face the threat of slipping in a 'banana skin' game right up in a tournament where one defeat can leave you at the door of exit.Next up for India are Pakistan on February 23 and then New Zealand on March 1-both in-form opponents. Clearly, this is a far bigger challenge for Rohit Sharma & Co than facing a dour England in a meaningless series at home.However, having just thrashed England 3-0 at home in the ODI series, India would be flying high on confidence going into this mini-global event purely because the format here suits them to the 'T'. Unlike the Tests, where they seemed to have lost the edge even on the deadly turners back home, and the T20Is, where things can be dicey, One-Day cricket is a format where India seemed to have aced their game.Remember their brilliant run in the 2023 World Cup at home, where India steam rolled all opposition, winning 10 out of 11 matches before a Travis Head century at Ahmedabad in the final robbed them of the title, as Australia broke a million hearts that Nov 19 night?Almost 16 months later, India would be slightly worried over the inconsistent, rather patchy form of their two old warhorses-captain Rohit Sharma and superstar Virat Kohli- a failure would raise more fingers and questions against their very presence in the team like never before. However, they would also be pleased as punch with the form of their vice-captain and opener Shubman Gill , who, on Wednesday overtook Pakistan's Babar Azam as the No 1 ranked batter in the ODIs. Just a few days back, Gill had stroked a sublime 112 off 102 balls against England in the third and last ODI, after stroking half-centuries in the previous two matches.To imagine that Shreyas Iyer, till he smashed that game-changing 44-ball 59 in the first ODI against England, wasn't even assured of a place in the XI! Despite the hue and cry over their call, India look set to give the wicketkeeper's spot to KL Rahul over Rishabh Pant- clearly preferring to stick by Rahul because of his proven record as a reliable middle-order bat.In the bowling department, India are certain to prefer left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh , who has enjoyed tremendous success in the T20Is (99 wickets in 63 matches, while has he has 14 scalps in nine ODIs), over Harshit Rana-impressive in his debut ODI series against England (six wickets in three matches) during which he generated pace and bounce.With Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel set to start in the XI, it would be interesting to see whom India would pick as their third spinner-Kuldeep Yadav or Varun Chakravarthy, for their lung-opener. Kuldeep offers accuracy, variation and experience, while Varun brings 'mystery'.Meanwhile, his team may have endured a lop-sided record against India-they have lost 32 out of 41 ODIs at the hands of the cricketing giants and-but at the pre-match presser on Wednesday here, Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto was bullish about his team's chances to upset India straightaway in the CT opener. In a slight jolt to their campaign, Bangladesh lost their warm-up match to the Pakistan Shaheens (Pakistan A side) here, but Shanto refused to read much into it, saying that ""It won't have any effect because we saw a lot of things in the practice match. Everybody got a chance to bowl or bat. So, in general, it is for the sake of practice.""Asked if superstar allrounder Shakib Al Hasan's absence in this tournament was a concern for Bangladesh, Shanto replied with an emphatic: ""No.""Clearly, the Bangladesh skipper is basing his confidence on his team's new-found, young pace battery, headlined by the talented young quick Nahid Rana, who is backed up by the experienced Mustafizur Rahman and Taskin Ahmed and a slew of useful allrounders.Quizzed on whether the presence of multiple all-rounders in his team was an advantage for a captain, Shanto said, ""All-rounders always balance the team and we have got some good all-rounders. I hope they will perform tomorrow and play well.""One thing which could make this match different for India, and even out things, is the presence of many Bangladesh fans in the crowd as well, thanks to the large number of expats from that country. In fact, on Thursday, one can even expect a ratio of '50-50' when it comes to crowd support.Asked if the crowd factor could help his team lift their game, a smiling Shanto said, ""Yes, obviously I hope so. Wherever we are going to play, there are a lot of supporters. They support us when we win or lose. So, that is a big part of this game and we feel the crowd will come tomorrow and support us.""","India face Bangladesh in the opening match of the 2025 Champions Trophy in Dubai on Thursday.

Champions Trophy: Pant's trademark no-look sixes and Iyer's clean hits steal the show

NEW DELHI: Will Young and Tom Latham delivered outstanding centuries as New Zealand secured a convincing 60-run victory against hosts Pakistan in the Champions Trophy opening match on Wednesday. Young scored a crucial 107 from 113 deliveries, whilst Latham remained not out with 118 from 104 balls, guiding the Black Caps to 320 for five after Pakistan chose to field first.

Mohammad Amir Exclusive: Champions Trophy hopes, India's absence & retirement talk

Such is the format of the Champions Trophy that even one defeat can jeopardise a team's chances of making it to the semifinals, and Pakistan must be licking its wounds while thinking that after their loss in the tournament opener against New Zealand on Wednesday in Karachi . But focus shifts to India's big stars in match number two, as stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma take the field against Bangladesh in another Group-A game, this time in Dubai .The forced fourth venue for the tournament -- the Dubai International Cricket Stadium -- was brought in by the International Cricket Council (ICC) after India refused to play in Pakistan and the tournament turned hybrid.Bangladesh can be considered the weakest team on paper in Group A , but they have upset teams in the past in big tournaments. In India's case, mind rolls back to 2007, when the defeat against Bangladesh in a group game of the ODI World Cup haunted India until they exited the tournament before the knockouts.India announced their preparedness for the Champions Trophy by mauling England 3-0 in an ODI series at home, which also saw Rohit and Kohli getting some much needed runs under their belt. But losing Jasprit Bumrah to a back injury came as a jolt at the doorstep of the Champions Trophy, which has turned the fast-bowling unit a little deficient -- considering Mohammed Shami has just returned from a year-long injury layoff, Arshdeep Singh is short on ODI experience and Bumrah's replacement Harshit Rana is still finding his feet in international cricket.In contrast, the batting wears a settled look with Shubman Gill opening with Rohit, followed by Kohli, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul or Rishabh Pant as wicketkeeper. Axar Patel's promotion as a batter and his recent success against England adds a left-handed batter to the mix in the line-up, a role that his fellow all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja too can perform. It also allows India to play with three spinners and still have two pacers in the playing eleven.The pitch in Dubai historically has had something in it for both bowlers and batters, with spinners getting assistance as it wears down.Another team looking closely at this contest will be Pakistan, who have the big must-win match against India next on February 23. One more defeat will virtually mean curtains for the fancied hosts, which is not how they would want to welcome the return of an ICC event to the country after 29 years.Their heavy loss to the Kiwis by 60 runs in Karachi on Wednesday has let the home fans down, leaving much to be desired from both batters and bowlers who will have to come up with something special against India in three days' time in different conditions in Dubai.",India take on Bangladesh in their second Champions Trophy match. The match will be played at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. India lost their opening game to New Zealand by 60 runs in Karachi. Pakistan face India in their next Group-A match on February 23.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118401439,imgsize-61460,width-400,resizemode-4/118401439.jpg"

Team India undergoes intense training in Dubai ahead of Champions Trophy | Exclusive Visuals

Champions Trophy: Pant's trademark no-look sixes and Iyer's clean hits steal the show

: Just when the ring of fire was lit in its full glory, the Indian cricket team was applying the final touches to their preparations for the Champions Trophy and opener against Bangladesh. The batters were knocking a few deliveries, all bowlers rolled their arm over on the available practice strip and everyone took turns for some catching to get used to the lights.Just when the players started making their way to the dressing room after finishing their routines, two intense chats began around 7 pm local time (half an hour after the scheduled end of training session). Near the playing square were coach Gautam Gambhir and Ravindra Jadeja while Rohit Sharma had Axar Patel and video analyst Hari Prasad Mohan for company in front of the dressing room. The two vital cogs of India's white-ball setup were in separate discussions which lasted well over 30 minutes.The coach kept pointing towards different parts of the ground while talking to Jadeja and captain Rohit had a more animated discussion with Axar where a lot of video footage was being used as reference.Analyst Hari kept playing visuals from different ODIs on his laptop and Rohit was even imitating Axar's release during their chat as the training session was in its final stages. Both Axar and Jadeja have a very similar skillset but are unique in their own way. The management trusts their abilities so much that both featured in the XI during the 2024 T20 World Cup, and it's set to continue during the 2025 Champions Trophy. They can bat anywhere you want, bowl anytime the situation demands and are electric in the field.More than anything, they lend control with their darts which have often suck momentum out of the opposition's innings.Plenty of eyebrows were raised when the men's senior selection committee picked five spinners in the squad for the multi-nation event but captain Rohit Sharma explained the move and asserted there are just ""two spinners"".‚ÄúThere are two spinners, the other three are all-rounders. I am not looking at them as five spinners. Those three guys can bat and can bowl also. The other teams have fast bowlers and all-rounders. They say that they have six fast bowlers, which is good. But we work on our strength and try to run the team on that,"" said Rohit at pre-match presser The Indian captain further added that the all-round abilities of Jadeja, Axar and Washington Sundar add a different dimension and a lot of depth to the combination.""Those three guys, Jadeja, Axar, Washi [Washington Sundar], give us a different dimension to the game, to our combination, to our squad. And they add a lot to this team and give us a lot of depth. That is why we wanted to try and get the players who can have two skills rather than one skill,"" added Rohit.India do look heavy on spin but depth was the keyword when the squad was assembled. Axar and Jadeja's skill set would make it difficult for any think-tank to look beyond them, and this Indian team is no different. They both are left-armers, effective batters, useful contributors but even after the similarities, they are different, and will continue to be the first names on the team sheet.",Team India undergoes intense training in Dubai ahead of Champions Trophy.

Champions Trophy: Will India and South Africa clash in another ICC final?

NEW DELHI: India will play all their ICC Champions Trophy 2025 matches in Dubai, but the excitement has spread worldwide. TV sets are being prepped, Team India jerseys are out and dry cleaned, refrigerators are stocked with drinks and snacks, and fans are eagerly awaiting the moment when captain Rohit Sharma walks out for the toss.The Champions Trophy fever is in full swing!Amid all the excitement, there‚Äôs been plenty of buzz surrounding the pitch. How is the pitch going to behave? If Rohit wins the toss, should he choose to bat or bowl?The answers will come on February 20, but the anticipation continues to rise!In an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com during the ILT20-3 season in the UAE this January, Dubai International Stadium pitch curator Matthew Sandery revealed that curators have not received any instructions from any team, including India. He also assured that the pitch would offer consistent bounce.India are in Group A alongside Bangladesh, Pakistan, and New Zealand. They will kick off their campaign in Dubai on February 20 against Bangladesh, followed by the highly anticipated clash with Pakistan on February 23, before facing New Zealand on March 2.""We're in a really good spot at the moment. We want to keep all our secrets under wraps for now. We had the Women's World Cup earlier this year, and it has really helped us improve our wickets. We're really hoping for a great tournament with our services,"" Sandery said.""No instructions (regarding the pitch). We're going to create the best surfaces for Dubai and the weather that obviously comes with the UAE. So we're going to make the best wickets possible for the best teams when they come here. We're really excited about the fact that India, Bangladesh, New Zealand, and obviously Pakistan, are coming. The big clash between India and Pakistan‚Äî as an Australian curator, I'm very excited.""We're going to produce the best quality surface at the time. We are making sure our surface is consistent, and our bounce is consistent. We want to make sure that when our players arrive here, they can hit through the ball. They should feel confident and comfortable that they can hit through the ball because fours and sixes in white-ball cricket bring people to the stands. So yeah, we're not going to change too much. We're going to make sure we create the best wickets for Dubai and Dubai only,"" Sandery said.India last faced Pakistan in Dubai in 2022, meeting twice during the Asia Cup. India registered a five-wicket win in the group stage but later fell to Pakistan by the same margin in the Super Four clash.Unlike the Asia Cup, which was a T20 tournament, the upcoming Champions Trophy will be a 50-over contest.Will dew be a decisive factor?""Of course, the UAE provides unique weather conditions, and here at the stadium, we have a unique structure. Our roof structure provides a lot of shade for most of the ground. The sunlight plays a massive role as well, because it comes across the wicket early and halfway through the afternoon. So naturally, it's going to play differently throughout the match. It's up to the batter and the bowler to adapt,"" Sandery said.","India will play all their ICC Champions Trophy 2025 matches in Dubai.
