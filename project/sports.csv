With this, the CSK veteran continued to set new benchmarks, further cementing his legacy as not just a game-changing batter but also the most consistent and impactful wicket-keeper the IPL has ever seen.Even as Punjab Kings posted a daunting 219/6, largely thanks to Priyansh Arya’s record-breaking 103 off 42 balls, Dhoni's sharp glovework stood out in a game where bowlers were under siege.Having already retired from international cricket, Dhoni’s continued excellence in the IPL has become the stuff of legend.Whether it’s his lightning-quick stumpings, match-winning cameos, or tactical brilliance from behind the stumps, Dhoni proves that age is just a number.This latest achievement adds to a long list of records, including most dismissals by a wicket-keeper in the IPL.At 43, Dhoni remains the heartbeat of CSK, and his fitness and reflexes show no signs of fading.While young guns like Priyansh Arya lit up the scoreboard, it was Dhoni who made history once again with his gloves.In a game filled with fireworks, it was a quiet piece of brilliance behind the stumps that reminded everyone why Dhoni is, and will always be, one of the greatest to ever play the game.",MS Dhoni becomes the first wicket-keeper in IPL history to complete 150 catches behind the stumps.

A goal for the ages: Alex Ovechkin breaks Wayne Gretzky's 26-year record



FULL Alex Ovechkin Celebration Ceremony After Record-Breaking Goal No. 895

A legacy passed down: Anastasia Shubskaya receives diamond tribute from Janet Gretzky



After Alex Ovechkin netted his 895th career goal and broke legendary Wayne Gretzky 's record, Janet Gretzky showed respect to a time-honored hockey tradition by gifting Anastasia Shubskaya , wife of Alex Ovechkin, an eight-carat diamond ring that had been estimated at $280,000. The Capitals may have lost to the New York Islanders by a score of 4-1, but the outcome was an afterthought to a night all about legacy, love, and a new chapter in hockey's history.The moment of history arrived at 7:26 of the second period. Alex Ovechkin let go of a blazing shot through fellow Russian Ilya Sorokin, making himself the NHL's all-time leading goal scorer. Fans inside UBS Arena lost their minds, and Alex Ovechkin commemorated the occasion by executing a belly flop onto the ice—celebrating his big achievement.While Alex Ovechkin was absorbing the enormity of his achievement, Anastasia Shubskaya was gifted a symbolic token of the historic night. Continuing a tradition started in 1994, when Colleen Howe (wife of Gordie Howe) gave Janet Gretzky a diamond ring after her husband, Wayne Gretzky, broke Colleen Howe’s husband’s record, Janet Gretzky ensured history repeated itself—this time from one hockey family to another.In an interview with the media, Wayne Gretzky said, “A month ago, my wife said, ‘You know, Colleen Howe started a tradition. I’m not sure if anyone is going to break Alex’s record, but I want to give her (Ovechkin’s wife, Anastasia Shubskaya) something really unique.’ So, we went out and she picked out an eight-diamond ring for Alex’s wife. Not only do hockey guys pass down traditions. So do the families and wives.”The act not only spanned generations of greatness but also underlined the strong relationship between hockey families across generations.Also read: “Now the real stuff is coming”: Alex Ovechkin skips The Tonight Show appearance to stay playoff-ready Even though the Capitals fell on the evening, the larger context is one of hope.

Red Sox's Wilyer Abreu matches early-season performance of MLB's highest-paid stars,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/red-soxs-wilyer-abreu-matches-early-season-performance-of-mlbs-highest-paid-stars/articleshow/120109309.cms,"Red Sox’s Wilyer Abreu matches early-season performance of MLB’s highest-paid stars (Image Source: X)

Wilyer Abreu's impressive play is compared to that of Aaron Judge and Kyle Tucker

Wilyer Abreu's development and destiny with Boston Red Sox

The Boston Red Sox have delivered a surprise superstar performance at the beginning of the 2025 MLB season. A relatively not-so-famous player earlier is now creating a sensation and being likened to some of the league's top performers. The supporters are taking notice as this athlete's incredible statistics continue to reach new heights.Boston Red Sox 26-year-old right fielder Wilyer Abreu has started the 2025 season on record-high numbers. During his first 11 games, he registered a.424 batting average, posting 14 hits in 33 at-bats. Offensively, he has logged three home runs, three doubles, and 12 run batted in (RBIs). Abreu has walked eight times, reporting a league-high on-base percentage of.537 and an on-base plus slugging (OPS) of 1.324.This type of performance places Abreu among the league's top performers. Notably, only Chicago Cubs' Kyle Tucker and New York Yankees' Aaron Judge have had a Wins Above Replacement (WAR) of 1.0 so early in the season. Tucker and Judge are famously remembered for having huge contracts as well as solid high-level performance.Aaron Judge, known for his powerful hitting, has continued to play impeccably for the Yankees. Similarly, Kyle Tucker has been an iconic player for the Cubs and has been part of their major offensive lineup. Abreu's recent performance statistics are drawing favourable comparisons with such seasoned stars as he highlights the potential contribution towards the Red Sox's season.Wilyer Abreu 's journey here has been one of steady development and resolve. After being acquired by the Boston Red Sox from the Houston Astros in a trade on August 1, 2022, Abreu worked on honing his skills in the minor leagues. Abreu debuted in the Major Leagues on August 22, 2023, and played in 28 games that season, batting.316 with two home runs and 14 RBIs.In the 2024 season, Abreu's playing time expanded as he played in 132 games, with 106 of them being right field starts. He ended the season with a batting average of.253, and 15 home runs and 58 RBIs. His defense was recognized with the Fielding Bible Award and the American League Gold Glove Award for right fielders.Abreu's offseason work ethic and dedication obviously came in handy, as evidenced by his amazing first half of the 2025 campaign. His new plate discipline is particularly astounding, with eight walks and six strikeouts to date, a welcome change from the 125 strikeouts and 40 walks of last year.Even if it is uncertain whether Abreu can maintain this level of performance for the entire season, his early production has been a large reason why the Red Sox have been successful. Pundits and fans alike will be keeping their eyes on what becomes of his season and whether he can keep up with the play of established stars like Aaron Judge and Kyle Tucker.Also Read: Red Sox's Jarren Duran Shares Emotional Journey Through Depression And Recovery In New Netflix Documentary","Boston Red Sox right fielder Wilyer Abreu has started the 2025 season on record- high numbers.

“Travis Kelce breaks up with Taylor Swift”: Internet explodes with false breakup rumors as the power couple secretly go off-grid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-kelce-breaks-up-with-taylor-swift-internet-explodes-with-false-breakup-rumors-as-the-power-couple-secretly-go-off-grid/articleshow/120096599.cms,"Image via Getty Images

What sparked the Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift breakup rumors?

Sources say the couple is “still very much together and in love”

In recent days, social media has been buzzing with rumors suggesting that Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift may have called it quits. The trending phrase “Travis Kelce breaks up with Taylor Swift” quickly made its rounds online, sparking concern among fans. However, sources close to the couple have stepped in to set the record straight — the power couple is still very much together.The speculation began after both Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift noticeably stepped back from the public eye following a whirlwind few months. After the Kansas City Chiefs lost the Super Bowl to the Philadelphia Eagles in February, and with Swift wrapping up the final leg of her record-breaking Eras Tour and attending the Grammys, fans noticed a lack of appearances and updates. This silence was enough to ignite rumors of a possible split.But insiders familiar with the couple’s dynamic have confirmed that the rumors are nothing more than unfounded speculation. The two are still going strong, choosing instead to prioritize rest and downtime after months of demanding schedules.According to a source quoted by US Weekly, “Taylor and Travis are doing great, and they’re still very much together and in love. They’re just taking a break from the public eye. They’re enjoying some R&R after working their butts off, making the most of their time off.” This insight gives fans a clearer picture of what’s really going on — not a breakup, but a much-needed pause from constant public scrutiny.The same source added that both stars are seeking a more grounded lifestyle following months of nonstop media attention, viral moments, and career obligations. “They’re looking to enjoy a ‘normal life’ after some chaotic past months,” the source explained.Despite their effort to stay low-key, the couple’s past outings — from romantic dinners to music festivals — continue to make waves online. A clip from Coachella 2024 recently resurfaced, showing Kelce and Swift walking hand-in-hand, radiating ease and affection.Also Read: Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift savor quiet moments together, amid uncertain future together So, while the internet may be quick to jump to conclusions, fans can breathe easy knowing that this Hollywood-meets-NFL romance is still thriving, just away from the spotlight for now.","Sources say Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are still very much together and in love.

Cody Bellinger gets ill after consuming chicken wings

Trent Grisham and Ben Rice fill in while Cody Bellinger is out

New York Yankees outfielder Cody Bellinger wasn't found in Tuesday's game against the Detroit Tigers' lineup. There was no explanation initially for him missing the lineup, and it had fans scratching their heads trying to make sense of it all. As the game drew closer, manager Aaron Boone revealed the surprising reason for Bellinger's absence. It all started when he ate something the night before.Last Monday night, April 7, 2025, Cody Bellinger ate chicken wings for dinner. Already in the early morning of Tuesday, April 8, he began to feel ill. Vomiting all night, New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone reported. The team believes that he got food poisoning after consuming the chicken wings on Monday night. Aaron Boone informed the journalists before Tuesday's game in Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan.Boone supplemented, ""Hopefully he's feeling a little bit better now, and we'll see if we can get him going and make him available as the game goes.""Even though Cody Bellinger's condition did not improve in time for the game, the team hopes he will return soon.This condition coincides with a difficult stretch already for Bryant Bellinger. The 28-year-old left-fielder also missed Friday, April 4, and Saturday, April 5, of the Yankees' two-game series against the Pittsburgh Pirates because of a sore back.Now, just a few days back from returning, food poisoning has benched him once more. The Yankees have not shown that he will be available for the team's next game, but he is under close observation by the medical staff of the team.Manager Aaron Boone did mention that none of the other members of the team had any illness, and the rest of the roster was fine. The food seems to have affected Bellinger alone.While Cody Bellinger was out of action, Trent Grisham began in center field. This was Grisham's sixth straight game there. But he would have been in the lineup regardless, as the Yankees were facing Tigers left-handed starter Tarik Skubal.Ben Rice also got some time on the field, becoming the designated hitter. The left-handed batter had to deal with a tough left-on-left matchup against Skubal, but the team believed he was capable of handling it.The Yankees will just keep watching Cody Bellinger's health and see how he's doing before they make any decision on when he'll return to the lineup. At the moment, the team is merely trying to keep the roster healthy and adjust as needed.Also Read: Will Cody Bellinger Play Today Against Detroit Tigers?

“He’s a small human being and eagles are strong animals, so I really wouldn’t be surprised,”

“If that’s real, I think I got to go meet them... take a picture with Saquon.”

When it comes to repping the Eagles, Kevin Hart might’ve just out-fanned every fan on Earth—possibly even the ones in shoulder pad costumes at Lincoln Financial. The Philly-born comedian took his Birds loyalty to the next level, and now even Saquon Barkley is stunned. Why? Because Kevin didn’t just cop some Eagles merch or post a hype video. He bought two—yes, the real, flying, majestic kind—and named one of them after Saquon Barkley himself. We’ve officially reached a level of fandom where celebrities aren’t just cheering from the sidelines… they’re forming personal relationships with birds of prey.

The price tag reportedly ran into the millions, but Hart didn’t flinch. His reasoning? The Eagles were headed for greatness, and he wanted to cement his own legacy in the most Philly way possible.During his recent appearance on, Saquon Barkley was confronted with the eagle-naming news—and let’s just say, he’s hoping Hart didn’t actually spend millions on live birds.Barkley said, visibly amused.But he didn’t stop there. Saquon doubled down on the humor when referencing Hart’s own claim that one of the eaglesBarkley joked.But now, fans on X are raising a valid question: Isn’t owning an eagle extremely illegal? Under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, private ownership of eagles is banned in the U.S. without a federal permit—and violations can lead to heavy fines or jail time.

Will LeBron James play tonight against the OKC Thunder? Los Angeles Lakers injury report for tonight’s game (April 8, 2025)

Lakers’ performance so far in this season

Theface potential setbacks as Luka Doncic , and Austin Reaves were all listed as questionable for Tuesday’s game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The trio’s status raises concerns as the Lakers prepare for a critical back-to-back, including a high-profile matchup against the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday. LeBron James is listed as probable for tonight’s game. So, there is some uncertainty surrounding tonight’s game against the OKC Thunder. Luka Doncic is also listed as questionable. Austin Reaves, Dorian Finney-Smith, Gabe Vincent, and Bronny James are also dubious, in addition to James and Doncic. Maxi Kleber, who has not yet made his Los Angeles Lakers debut, and Rui Hachimura have been ruled out. It appears likely that important players will be rested against the Thunder because the game is the first of a back-to-back, followed by a crucial game against the Dallas Mavericks.With four games remaining in the regular season, the Lakers are currently 48-30 and the third seed in the Western Conference. Maintaining their lead over the Denver Nuggets (1.5 games back) and Los Angeles Clippers (2 games back) is crucial for playoff seeding, even though it seems improbable that they can catch the Houston Rockets for the No. 2 seed.LeBron James, Luka Doncic, and Austin Reaves played crucial roles in Sunday’s win over the Thunder, combining for 69 points. Doncic led the charge with 30 points, seven rebounds, and six assists, while LeBron James contributed 19 points and seven assists. Reaves added 20 points, including four three-pointers. Despite their strong performances, the Los Angeles Lakers may opt to rest one or more of them to prioritize Wednesday’s game in Dallas.The Mavericks matchup holds extra significance for Doncic, marking his first return to Dallas since joining the Lakers. Emotions are expected to run high, especially with former Laker Anthony Davis now anchoring the Mavericks’ lineup. Teammates have acknowledged the importance of the game for Doncic, hinting at a possible strategic rest against the Thunder.The Los Angeles Lakers will go to Dallas to play Doncic's old squad following the Thunder matchup.

Diana Belbiță never planned on getting this far. That’s what makes her journey so easy to root for. She didn’t grow up dreaming about the UFC or imagining walkouts under the bright lights. But somehow, she made it—fought in Europe’s toughest promotions, stepped into the Octagon eight times, and left it all in there every single night. And now, at 28, she’s calling it a career. No big sendoff, no spotlight. Just a quiet, honest post on social media, reflecting on a ride she never expected. Diana Belbiță ’s pro career started in 2014, mostly under the radar in Romania. She wasn’t hyped as a phenom. She wasn’t fast-tracked. But she fought often, stayed consistent, and eventually caught the attention of KSW—one of Europe’s most respected MMA promotions. That’s where she had her first real breakthrough, even fighting for a title before heading to the UFC.Her run in the UFC wasn’t perfect. It wasn’t supposed to be. She went 2-6 over six years, picking up wins against Hannah Goldy in 2021 and Maria Oliveira in 2023. She lost some tough ones, including her last three, with her final appearance ending in a submission loss to Dione Barbosa this past weekend.A few days later, she posted a simple message on X.“It was fun fighting at the highest level,” she wrote. “I never even dared to dream that I will get there, but I ended up spending my last 6 years fighting for the best promotion in the world. It was a fun journey and I loved it. Now it’s time for me to start a new chapter.”That last part hits hardest. Not everyone who makes it to the UFC feels like they belong. For Belbiță, just being there meant everything. She wasn’t chasing belts—she was chasing something bigger than that. She was proving to herself that she could stand among the best.Her second-to-last fight came against Molly McCann, another gritty veteran who recently retired herself. There’s something fitting about that—two fighters who gave it their all, even when the wins didn’t come easy, stepping away on their own terms.Also Read: Michal Oleksiejczuk Teams Up with The Fighting Nerds Ahead of UFC 314 Fight vs. Sedriques Dumas Diana Belbiță won’t go down as a UFC legend. But she showed up. She kept going when the odds weren’t in her favor. And for six years, she did something she never even thought was possible. That matters. That sticks with people. Her record won’t tell the full story—but her journey will.","Diana Belbiță has retired from the UFC after eight fights. The 28-year-old Romanian fought in Europe's toughest promotions.

IPL: KKR skipper Ajinkya Rahane slams Eden pitch after defeat to LSG

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders captain Ajinkya Rahane expressed dissatisfaction with the pitch at Eden Gardens, noting its lack of assistance for spinners following the team's home defeat.Rahane, while cautious in his remarks, hinted at the potential controversy surrounding discussions of 'home advantage.'The match against Lucknow Super Giants , which ended in a narrow four-run defeat for KKR, marked their second loss in three home games this season.Rahane highlighted the ineffective spin bowling conditions, contrasting with expectations for the match.""Firstly, there was no help for the spinners, let me clear that,"" Rahane said in the post-match press conference. ""They used the boundary really well, you know, bowling to the longer end, I mean longer boundary, they did that really well, our bowlers tried as well, but again, (Nicholas) Pooran and Mitchell Marsh batted really well in between, they took their chances which came off really well for them.""""It was a lovely wicket, we all saw that, scoring almost 500 runs on this track, hard for the bowlers, but again, they used the conditions and used the boundary really well.""The game saw a high-scoring affair with LSG setting a formidable total of 238/3, and KKR falling short at 234/7.Rahane's strategy to bowl first did not yield the desired outcome as the opposition batters, notably Nicholas Pooran and Mitchell Marsh, capitalized on the conditions effectively.KKR's spin duo, Sunil Narine and Varun Chakravarthy, struggled, failing to secure any wickets and conceding runs at a rate of over nine per over.This performance led to questions about the relevance of 'home advantage' in the IPL , a topic Rahane approached with caution to avoid controversy.""See, there's been enough talk about the wicket. Aap logon ne bahut usko yeh kar diya hai. Toh agar main abhi kuch bolunga na, toh bawal ho jayega. (You people have already hyped it up a lot. So if I say anything now, it will create a big controversy),"" Rahane added.""Jo hamare curator hai, unko bahut publicity mila. I think he's happy with that publicity. Home advantage ke baare mein aapko jo likhna hai, aap likh sakto, jo laga. (Our curator has got a lot of publicity. I think he's happy with that publicity. You can write whatever you feel like about the home advantage). If I have any concern, I would probably convey it to the IPL rather than speaking about it here.""Regarding his personal performance and aspirations for an India comeback, Rahane said, ""I'm really enjoying my cricket at the moment, firstly playing for KKR and playing at the Eden. For me, it's all about staying in the moment, enjoying my cricket, enjoying my batting, and that's it. I don't want to think far too ahead.""","Kolkata Knight Riders captain Ajinkya Rahane slams Eden pitch after defeat to LSG.

His contribution was particularly notable in the finals, where he scored 48 runs off 62 balls, helping his team in the middle overs.Under Iyer's captaincy, Punjab Kings suffered a heavy 50-run defeat at the hands of Rajasthan Royals in Mullanpur, as their IPL 2025 campaign tasted its first defeat.Chasing a daunting 206, PBKS faltered early with both openers, including captain Shreyas Iyer, dismissed inside the powerplay by a fiery Jofra Archer.Archer finished with 3/25, setting the tone for Rajasthan’s commanding bowling performance.Earlier, Yashasvi Jaiswal starred with the bat, scoring a fluent 67 off 45 balls, supported by Sanju Samson (38) and a late flourish from Riyan Parag (43 not out). Their efforts propelled RR to a formidable 205/4. Despite some resistance in the middle order, PBKS couldn’t recover from early blows and ended at 155/9.The loss raises concerns for Punjab, particularly around their top-order fragility and captain Iyer’s underwhelming form, while Rajasthan Royals regained much-needed momentum and a healthy net run rate boost with the victory.","Shreyas Iyer found himself in tears during the first practice session of the Champions Trophy 2025.

Playoff implications and what’s at stake for Memphis Grizzlies

Can Morant lead the Grizzlies to the playoffs?

The Western Conference playoff race remains wide open as thefight to secure their spot. With every game carrying postseason implications, the Grizzlies face the Charlotte Hornets tonight in what should be a must-win matchup. The biggest question looming over the game: Willsuit up after missing the previous contest?Memphis received a scare when their star point guard Ja Morant was ruled out last minute against the Pistons due to food poisoning. However, interim head coach Tuomas Iisalo provided positive updates ahead of tonight’s game.Key takeaways from the injury report:- Ja Morant (food poisoning) – Expected to return- Zyon Pullin (knee injury) – Out- Brandon Clarke (knee) – Out for the seasonMorant’s return is crucial for Memphis, as he leads the team with averages of 22.9 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 7.3 assists per game. His absence was felt, but the Memphis Grizzlies managed back-to-back wins against Miami and Detroit without him.With Morant back in action, Memphis is expected to field a strong starting five. Here’s the projected lineup:Desmond Bane’s recent 38-point explosion against Detroit and rookie Zach Edey’s dominant 21-rebound performance provide additional firepower. The Memphis Grizzlies will rely on their core players to secure a vital road win. The Grizzlies currently hold the 8th seed in the West, making every remaining game critical. Key factors in tonight’s matchup:- The Hornets (19-59) have little to play for besides their final home game.- Memphis must capitalize on weaker opponents to climb the standings.- A win could help them avoid the play-in tournament or secure a better seeding.While Charlotte’s poor record suggests an easy victory, NBA unpredictability means Memphis can’t afford to take anything for granted.Ja Morant’s return provides a major boost, but Memphis must maintain consistency. With only a few games left, each performance could determine their postseason fate. If the Grizzlies play to their potential, they should handle the Hornets, but in this tight Western race, nothing is guaranteed.Also read: Why is LaMelo Ball not playing tonight against the Memphis Grizzlies?

Pittsburgh Pirates ace Paul Skenes will take the mound against St. Louis Cardinals veteran Sonny Gray in a compelling pitching matchup on Tuesday night at PNC Park. The Pittsburgh Pirates (4-7) will look to extend their winning streak to three games after defeating the St. Louis Cardinals 8-4 on Monday, while St. Louis (4-6) hopes to snap a four-game losing skid. The first pitch is scheduled for April 8, 2025 at 6:40 PM ET as the National League Central rivals continue their three-game series in Pittsburgh.The Pittsburgh Pirates will send their prized young right-hander, Paul Skenes to the mound for his third start of the 2025 season. Skenes, last year's National League Rookie of the Year, has been impressive in his early outings, posting a 1-0 record with a stellar 1.46 ERA. In his last start on April 2 against the Tampa Bay Rays, Skenes dominated through seven shutout innings, allowing just three hits while striking out six and walking none.Despite his early career success, Skenes is still searching for his first career victory against the St. Louis Cardinals.

Joey Bart went 2-for-4 with a triple, home run and two RBIs in the victory, while Andrew McCutchen and Isiah Kiner-Falefa also drove in two runs apiece.The St. Louis Cardinals will counter with veteran right-hander Sonny Gray, who has experienced mixed results in his first two starts of the 2025 campaign. Gray enters with a 1-0 record and 5.73 ERA, having struck out an impressive 15 batters in just 11 innings pitched. In his most recent outing on April 2 against the Los Angeles Angels, Gray allowed five earned runs on five hits over six innings while recording nine strikeouts and no walks.Gray said after his last start.Despite their current four-game losing streak, the St. Louis Cardinals boast one of baseball's most potent offenses. St. Louis leads the majors with a 0.297 team batting average and ranks second with 6.6 runs per game. Brendan Donovan has been particularly hot, batting 0.375 on the season and collecting three hits in Monday's loss. The team might be without third baseman Nolan Arenado, however, as he's listed as day-to-day with an illness.The St. Louis Cardinals' pitching staff has struggled mightily, posting a league-worst 6.29 ERA through their first ten games of the season.Also Read: Pittsburgh Pirates rookie Paul Skenes named National League Rookie of the Year","Pittsburgh Pirates ace Paul Skenes will take the mound against St. Louis Cardinals veteran Sonny Gray in a compelling pitching matchup on Tuesday night at PNC Park.

Chennai Super Kings (CSK) have dropped five catches during their encounter against Punjab Kings on Tuesday night at the New PCA Cricket Stadium in Chandigarh. Overall, CSK have spilled 11 catches in this IPL season only.Following their 18-run loss, CSK skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad has acknowledged that poor fielding cost them the match against Punjab.“In the last four games, the only point of difference has been fielding,” he said in the post-match presentation.“Dropped catches have cost us. The same batsman goes on to score 15, 20, or even 30 more runs after a drop.”Chennai Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming too has lambasted his side's fielding against Punjab match.""The game was really lost in the field,"" Fleming told reporters after the match.""I thought we were sloppy in the field, and we just lacked accuracy under pressure at certain times. We were put under pressure by fine innings, but we've got to be better than that in terms of shutting it down.""So, that's where the game got away from us, and we're 18 runs short in a big run chase, so we can look at three sixes here and there.So, yeah, it's a frustrating season so far. The catching has been poor, but it was poor from both sides tonight. Whether it was something in the light, I'm not sure, but certainly for us, that was an area of concern.""If you want to pick up 20 runs, it's probably that and drop catches.""","Chennai Super Kings (CSK) have dropped five catches during their encounter against Punjab Kings.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

IPL: KKR skipper Ajinkya Rahane slams Eden pitch after defeat to LSG

NEW DELHI: Young opener Priyansh Arya stamped his arrival on the big stage with a breathtaking maiden IPL century that powered Punjab Kings (PBKS) to a thrilling 18-run victory over Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in a high-octane clash on Tuesday.Batting first, PBKS posted a commanding 219 for 6, thanks largely to a spectacular innings from 24-year-old Arya, who hammered 103 off just 42 balls. His audacious knock included seven boundaries and nine towering sixes, lighting up the Mullanpur stadium and lifting his team from a precarious position of 83/5 in just eight overs.Arya’s counter-attacking brilliance turned the momentum in Punjab’s favour. He displayed maturity beyond his years, especially against seasoned bowlers like Ravichandran Ashwin, against whom he hit three sixes, and Sri Lanka's Matheesha Pathirana, whose 13th over went for 24 runs. His hundred came off a mistimed edge over third man, but by then, he'd already done the damage.“He’s got raw power, and now he’s learning the angles. That’s the difference,” said PBKS head coach Ricky Ponting , who had backed Arya at the start of the season. “This knock was special, not just for the runs, but the way he built it under pressure.”Shashank Singh (52 not out off 36) provided a composed finishing touch, while Marco Jansen chipped in with a late flourish (34 not out off 19), helping PBKS reach their highest-ever total at the venue.In reply, CSK managed 201 for 5 despite Devon Conway’s 69, Shivam Dube’s 42 and late fireworks from MS Dhoni (27 off 12). However, Arya’s early onslaught had already defined the outcome. A flat bowling effort, especially from Pathirana (4-0-52-0) and Ashwin (4-0-48-2), left CSK chasing shadows.With this win, PBKS snapped a losing streak, while Arya’s breakout century could be a turning point in both his IPL career and Punjab’s campaign.",Punjab Kings beat Chennai Super Kings by 18 runs. Priyansh Arya hits maiden IPL century for PBKS. PBKS posted 219-6 in their 20 overs.

Their spinners, Sunil Narine and Varun Chakravarthy, went wicketless and expensive, while Harshit Rana and Spencer Johnson bore the brunt of LSG’s aggression.Despite a valiant 61 from skipper Ajinkya Rahane and a late flourish from Rinku Singh (38 not out), KKR’s 234/7 fell just short, as Pooran's milestone mayhem proved to be the decisive blow in a high-octane clash.","Nicholas Pooran hits unbeaten 87 as Lucknow Super Giants beat Kolkata Knight Riders.

KOLKATA: Mohun Bagan SG are alive with their dream of an Indian Super League ( ISL ) ‘double’.A penalty by Jason Cummings (51) and a banger from Lalengmawia Ralte ‘Apuia’ (90+4) helped Jose Molina’s League Shield winners subdue a doggedly defensive Jamshedpur FC 2-0 in the return leg of the ISL Cup semifinals at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday and clinch a place in the final for the third season running with a 3-2 victory on aggregate.Mohun Bagan — who lost the championship final to Mumbai City last season — will host Bengaluru FC in the summit clash here on April 12, hoping to become the second team to seal a Shield-and-Cup double.Khalid Jamil’s Jamshedpur came here with a 2-1 advantage and laid out an ultra-defensive plan, making life difficult for Bagan, who lashed the rival box with attack after attack.In the absence of suspended defensive mainstay Stephen Eze and Ashutosh Mehta, Pranoy Halder rose to the occasion, trying to keep Jamshedpur afloat against the tide. But Halder also committed blunders allowing Bagan the necessary routes to turn things around.First, Halder handled Tom Aldred’s header off a Cummings corner. Cummings made no mistake from the resultant penalty. Then, Apuia provided the proverbial coup de grâce, after Halder gave the ball away to Anirudh Thapa who laid it in the Mizo’s path.",Mohun Bagan SG are alive with their dream of an Indian Super League ( ISL ) ‘double’ A penalty by Jason Cummings (51) and a banger from Lalengmawia Ralte ‘Apuia’ (90+4) helped Jose Molina’s League Shield winners subdue a doggedly defensive Jamshedpur FC 2-0.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120083779,imgsize-68342,width-400,resizemode-4/Mohun-Bagan.jpg"
