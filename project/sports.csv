The bigger picture



Sometimes, the margins of victory can be paper thin — and in a state like Bihar, where allegiances and alliances shift like monsoon clouds, that couldn’t be more true. Every election here is a reminder that even a few hundred votes can redraw political maps.As the 2025 Assembly elections draw closer, attention is turning to constituencies that saw the closest contests last time. In seats like Hilsa, Barbigha, and Dehri, the margins were under 500 votes — outcomes that could have flipped with just a few booths. The JD(U) and RJD had both won and lost such razor-edge battles, and with alliances realigned since then, each of these constituencies is now back in play.Perhaps the most dramatic contest of 2020, Hilsa saw JD(U)’s Krishnamurari Sharan, also known as Prem Mukhiya, edge out RJD’s Atri Muni (Shakti Singh Yadav) by just 12 votes — both polling around 37.35% of the total vote. The seat, part of Nalanda district, has historically swung between the two parties and is expected to be one of the most hard-fought battles this time as well. With Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) and RJD once again on opposite sides, Hilsa could become a litmus test for how voters view Nitish’s return to the NDA.In Barbigha, JD(U)’s Sudarshan Kumar barely managed to stay ahead of Congress’s Gajanand Shahi by just 113 votes. Both polled around 33% each, showing how split the electorate was.The Congress had performed strongly here in 2020 despite limited organisational strength in the area. The party’s persistence in contesting the seat again, despite friction with RJD over seat-sharing, underlines its continued importance to the INDIA bloc.RJD’s Sudhakar Singh clinched Ramgarh by a margin of just 189 votes over BSP’s Ambika Singh, while BJP’s Ashok Kumar Singh was only 2,800 votes behind them. With three major parties within 2% of each other, the 2020 result was one of the tightest three-way finishes in Bihar. RJD hopes to consolidate anti-BJP votes this time, but the BSP’s influence among Dalit voters could again make it unpredictable.In Matihani, the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) created a surprise when its candidate Raj Kumar Singh narrowly defeated JD(U)’s Narendra Kumar Singh by only 333 votes, while CPI(M)’s Rajendra Prasad Singh was just another 400 votes behind. With three candidates each securing nearly 29% of the vote, Matihani remains one of Bihar’s most unpredictable battlegrounds. The left’s continued presence here means even small shifts in alliances could change the outcome dramatically.JD(U)’s Sunil Kumar won Bhorey by just 462 votes over CPI(ML)’s Jitendra Paswan, with both polling above 40%. The Left’s strong showing reflected CPI(ML)’s growing rural base, particularly among Dalit and agrarian voters. With CPI(ML) now a formal part of the INDIA bloc, Bhorey could see a direct face-off between NDA and the Left once again.Another cliffhanger unfolded in Dehri, where RJD’s Phate Bahadur Singh beat BJP’s Satyanarayan Singh by just 464 votes, both polling over 41%. The constituency has often mirrored the broader state trend — a reason why both alliances are expected to deploy senior leaders here this year.In Bachhwara, BJP’s Surendra Mehata edged out CPI’s Abdhesh Kumar Rai by only 484 votes. The contest was a straight Left-versus-BJP duel, with both commanding nearly 30% each. The CPI’s local base here, built over decades, remains intact. Interestingly, CPI is again pitted against the Congress in some seats this time, exposing fissures within the INDIA bloc even as they attempt coordination.Chakai produced one of 2020’s biggest upsets when independent candidate Sumit Kumar Singh defeated RJD’s Savitri Devi by just 581 votes. Singh has since joined the NDA and could benefit from the combined BJP–JD(U) machinery. However, with RJD determined to reclaim the seat, Chakai is once again poised for a close battle — especially with JMM also eyeing influence in the region.Kurhani’s 2020 contest between RJD’s Anil Kumar Sahni and BJP’s Kedar Prasad Gupta ended with just 712 votes separating the two. RJD polled 40.23% to BJP’s 39.86%. Kurhani, located in Muzaffarpur district, has changed hands multiple times and was even the site of a bypoll in 2022. Its outcome this year could reflect whether Tejashwi Yadav’s message of youth and jobs resonates against the NDA’s stability pitch.In Bakhri, CPI’s Suryakant Paswan defeated BJP’s Ramshankar Paswan by 777 votes, both getting more than 43% of the vote. As one of Bihar’s few remaining Left bastions, Bakhri will be closely watched to see if CPI can retain its grip amid the NDA’s push into Scheduled Caste–reserved seats.As the NDA and INDIA bloc prepare for the 2025 polls — with voting scheduled for November 6 and 11 and results on November 14 — these ten constituencies exemplify Bihar’s deep political fragmentation. With Nitish Kumar back in the NDA and Tejashwi Yadav leading a divided opposition, margins as thin as those from 2020 could once again decide the fate of Bihar’s 243-seat Assembly.","Hilsa, Barbigha, and Dehri were the constituencies that saw the closest contests last time. The JD(U) and RJD had both won and lost such razor-edge battles, and with alliances realigned since then, each of these constituencies is now back in play.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124688881,imgsize-1210752,width-400,resizemode-4/bihar-polls.jpg"

GUWAHATI: How deeply can an entire state and its diverse populations transform in a month? No, not from the outside. Not because of sparkling elevated roads that suddenly emerge to make travel lighter, global award-winning airports that attract international attention, or malls with facades so shiny that they throw back your reflection as if it were a giant mirror. From the inside.There is no way to measure such abstract possibilities. But if you want to witness a phenomenon with little known precedent – just to challenge a theory perhaps, or a long-held belief regarding the nature of change and the time it takes – come to Guwahati and travel across Assam to see what’s happened in the 30 days since one of its most beloved icons, singer Zubeen Garg, died away from home in Singapore on Sept 19.Earlier, not too long ago, when a visitor arrived in Assam, relatives, friends and tour guides would nudge the guest to first complete the two most important tasks in an unchanging Guwahati itinerary – darshan at the revered Kamakhya mandir and a stroll along the mighty Brahmaputra.Now, you’ll be asked to do one more thing – head to Sonapur, about 20 km away from the city, where Zubeen’s final resting place has metamorphosed into a shrine that welcomes thousands every day in an unending procession.A grand memorial will be up soon, the people have been promised. But grief can’t wait for monuments.At the site of immense sorrow, an old man with a flowing beard and fraying kurta pock-marked with age, said, “Zubeen spoke for all of us.” Ashraful Syed, 73 years old, had come with his grandson Mobin, and granddaughter Hameeda.There were other Muslims milling around, listening intently to a women’sgroup from Nagaon, who had brought along metal cymbals and traditional drums, singing sombre hymns under a shaky canopy where the elderly sat in plastic chairs and the young on bare ground.If lakhs of people from almost all corners of Assam filled highways, community halls and stadiums in mourning in the days following Zubeen’s death, and markets closed for weeks (old-timers said they hadn’t seen an outpouring of grief like this even when its other beloved star, Bhupen Hazarika, died in Nov 2011), it was also because of, like Ashraful Syed said, Zubeen’s courage and sense of inclusiveness.He was secular in the most fundamental of ways, and brave – taking on the ULFA who stopped him from singing Hindi songs, the politicians who belittled the marginalized and persecuted, and the powerful who didn’t care much for their own people. And Zubeen did all this without a trace of self-importance, sitting on pavements with cash to give out to jobless youth, eating poori-sabji from paper plates on roadsides, making light of his drinking habit. Everything that a VIP wouldn’t. And he was loved universally for this.“Assam lost its darling child,” Sonalika Hazarika, 66, said at the Sonapur shrine. She’d come from Jorhat with three of her neighbours. “We come in small groups so as not to crowd the place. Others must also be given space. To pray for Zubeen’s peace and happiness. Assam’s too.”At what’s now called Zubeen Dham, there are long rows of cars parked on an uneven, oblong patch of land, a posse of new vehicles sliding in every minute to haggle for space. A newly erected toilet has begun to leak, unable to accommodate the thousands of fans and common folks who troop in every day.There are beggars and ice cream vendors. The kind you find near popular temples. A security contingent has been stationed to keep a watchful eye on the ever-expanding crowds. There are school kids in uniform, parents who’ve brought their children along, members of local music clubs, young men and women with partners. Even some policemen in khaki, who take off their shoes and leather belts to light a diya for Zubeen.Krishna Phukan, who says he repairs motorbikes at Ganeshguri in Guwahati, won’t celebrate Diwali. “Very few will,” he said, adding that he didn’t come for work until even a week ago. “But I ran out of money. Many traders are still reluctant to carry on their business. Ask anyone.”But Assam hasn’t just become sadder in the days following Zubeen’s passing. The heartbreak seems to have mutated into a larger discomfort and discontent. All sorts of answers and accountabilities are being sought, and the questions have gone beyond circumstances around the singer’s death.","Singer Zubeen Garg died in Singapore on Sept 19.

Bihar polls: Tej Pratap files nomination from Mahua with grandma's photo; sister Rohini wishes him luck,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-tej-pratap-files-nomination-from-mahua-with-grandmas-photo-sister-rohini-wishes-him-luck/articleshow/124607889.cms,"Tej Pratap Yadav (PTI)

Bihar Polls: UP CM Yogi Adityanath Accuses RJD, Congress of ‘Mischief’ Over Burqa Verification Order

NEW DLEHI: Janhit Janata Dal (JJD) chief and Lalu Yadav ’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav , who is set to contest from Mahua constituency in the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections , filed his nomination on Thursday accompanied by a roadshow and carrying a photo of his grandmother Marchiya Devi.Speaking to reporters, he said the occasion was significant for him as he had moved ahead with the blessings of his grandmother and parents.""I have moved ahead with the blessings of my grandmother and my parents. On this auspicious occasion, as I am required to file my nomination, I have brought my grandmother with me. She lives on in our hearts... People of Mahua will support whoever works for them. I worked to make Mahua a district and also give employment opportunities to the youth,"" Tej Pratap said, as quoted by ANI.Tej Pratap, who currently represents Hasanpur, had earlier served as Mahua MLA from 2015 to 2020. The seat is now held by RJD’s Mukesh Kumar Raushan.The JJD, which Tej Pratap floated after his expulsion from the RJD earlier this year, has announced 22 candidates in its first list for the assembly elections scheduled for November. His expulsion from the party followed a controversy involving a social media post where he claimed to be in a long-term relationship.Tej Pratap had later stated that his account was hacked.His strained ties with his family have played out publicly in recent months. On October 12, he unfollowed his younger brother and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on X. He had earlier unfollowed his sisters Misa Bharti and Hema Yadav. He now follows only five accounts, including his father Lalu Prasad Yadav, mother Rabri Devi, and sister Raj Lakshmi Yadav.Despite family tensions, Tej Pratap’s sister Rohini Acharya extended her support to him with a message on X: ""May you achieve all the success and happiness in the world, and may you always move forward like a shining light, brother. Wishing you all the very best... with love and blessings.""It makes an interesting twist in the Yadav family dynamics, as last month Rohini Acharya did something similar to his elder brother Tej Pratap when she unfollowed RJD, and Tejaswi Yadav from her social media accounts. The increasing rifts between family members playing out in public are often attributed to sudden importance given to Sanjay Yadav, a close friend to Tejaswi.On being asked about the grandmother and Acharya he said, ""I brought the photo of my grandmother Marchiya Devi in the nomination. With her blessing, I am going to win in Mahua. The Janshakti Janata Dal is going to win. Rohini Acharya called me, she extended her good wishes.""The Bihar Assembly elections will take place in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with counting scheduled for November 14. The main contest is expected between the NDA alliance led by BJP-JD(U) and the INDIA bloc led by RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav. JJD is among the new entrants in the fray, alongside Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj, which has announced plans to contest all 243 seats.",Lalu Yadav's elder son Tej Pratap Yadav filed his nomination for Bihar Assembly elections.

Why the Trade Could Make Sense

Key Impacts of the Trade

What It Means for Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks

Thecould be on the verge of one of the biggest shake-ups in franchise history. With Jayson Tatum sidelined for most, if not all, of the 2025-26 NBA season due to a severe Achilles injury, the team might consider a bold move to keep their championship window alive - one that involves acquiring Milwaukee Bucks superstarTatum’s absence leaves a massive void, but Jaylen Brown is expected to carry the offensive load. Still, as reported by Fansided’s Matt Moore, Boston could benefit from thinking long-term by making a blockbuster trade with Milwaukee - one that would bring a generational player to TD Garden.According to Moore, the proposed trade would send Jaylen Brown, Anfernee Simons, Sam Hauser, Xavier Tillman, and two first-round picks to the Bucks. In return, the Boston Celtics would receive Giannis Antetokounmpo, Myles Turner, and Bobby Portis.Moore described the potential deal as painful but transformative for both sides. He wrote, “Obviously, Jaylen Brown is the best player in any of these packages that the Bucks can get back. A good-to-great player, in his prime, on a long-term contract. It would be painful for the Boston Celtics to make this trade… but Boston gets to instantly reorganize their future.

Zach Wilson moved to third-string as Dolphins adjust QB depth chart





The Miami Dolphins are making a bold quarterback move ahead of their Week 7 clash against the Cleveland Browns. Tua Tagovailoa remains the starter, but rookie Quinn Ewers will now serve as his backup, replacing Zach Wilson. Miami is preparing for a challenging game in Cleveland’s windy, wet conditions while testing their quarterback depth.According to NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport, Quinn Ewers will be active as the backup to Tua Tagovailoa for the Dolphins’ matchup against the Browns. Zach Wilson has been moved to the third-string role. This marks Ewers’ first time active in an NFL game, highlighting Miami’s confidence in the rookie’s ability to step up under pressure. The move also gives Ewers a chance to make his NFL debut in a potentially high-stakes environment.Ewers, who played his final season at Texas, threw for 3,472 passing yards with 31 touchdowns and 12 interceptions, leading the SEC in touchdown passes. In the Dolphins’ preseason, he went 23-of-43 for 273 yards and two touchdowns, taking four sacks but committing no turnovers.

How a social media rumor spiraled out of control

Super Bowl SHOCK: Turning Point USA Plots Its OWN Halftime Show Amid Bad Bunny Drama

Adam Sandler remains focused on comedy and film, not politics

A bizarre viral rumor suggesting that Adam Sandler was set to perform at Turning Point USA’s All-American Halftime Show has officially been debunked. The claim, which spread rapidly across Facebook and X (formerly Twitter), alleged that the comedian would headline a rival event to the Super Bowl halftime show, but fact-checkers and sources close to Sandler have confirmed that the story is entirely fabricated.The rumor began earlier this week after a series of misleading Facebook posts claimed that “Adam Sandler will join Lara Trump at the Turning Point USA halftime show.” The posts racked up thousands of shares within hours, with users debating whether Adam Sandler had shifted toward political performances. However, no reputable news outlet, nor Turning Point USA itself, ever announced his involvement.According to media watchdog Primetimer, the rumor stemmed from a manipulated headline that mixed genuine coverage of Lara Trump’s recent offer to perform at the event with false claims about Sandler’s participation. The viral graphic even used a photo of Sandler from his Netflix stand-up special, adding to the illusion of authenticity.Fact-checkers later confirmed that Sandler has no known ties to Turning Point USA or its founder Charlie Kirk, and he has never publicly expressed interest in performing at political events.In reality, Adam Sandler’s current schedule is packed with promotional appearances for his upcoming Netflix sequel “Happy Gilmore 2” and a new family comedy project set for release in 2026.Sources close to the actor emphasized that he’s steering clear of politically charged platforms. “He’s focused on creative projects and touring, not partisan events,” one insider told Primetimer.This isn’t the first time Sandler has been the subject of viral misinformation. Earlier this year, fake posts alleged that he had exchanged texts with Charlie Kirk and criticized late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, both of which were later proven false.Also Read: Will Jennifer Lopez join Bad Bunny at the Super Bowl halftime show?

How Morgan Rielly turned trade rumors into a breakout season with the Toronto Maple Leafs

Morgan Rielly’s return as power-play quarterback could define how the Toronto Maple Leafs adjust without Mitch Marner

When Mitch Marner left Toronto this offseason, the Maple Leafs faced legitimate concerns about how they’d replace one of their most reliable offensive engines. Through the opening six games of the 2025–26 campaign, those fears have been tempered by an unlikely source: defenseman Morgan Rielly. The veteran has responded to offseason trade rumors and a tough 2024–25 season by rediscovering his offensive spark, racking up six points while looking revitalized under Craig Berube’s system. With general manager Brad Treliving challenging him to lead, Rielly has embraced his role again as power-play quarterback, even as questions remain about the unit’s efficiency.Back in May, only days after Toronto was eliminated by the Florida Panthers in Game 7 of the second round, general manager Brad Treliving sat down with Rielly to review the year. According to those close to the team, the conversation was blunt but constructive: more was expected from the veteran. Morgan Rielly , who had posted just 41 points last season and was minus-three in that decisive playoff loss, could easily have been pushed aside. Instead, he arrived at training camp in the best shape of his career.“I thought (Morgan) had a really good game, skated well, moved the puck well, good reads, defended well, he was solid,” Berube said on October 9 at Scotiabank Arena after Rielly netted the game-winner against the Montreal Canadiens in the season opener. “(It) was great to see him have a good game.(There was) a lot of good, and there’s stuff that we’ve got to work on, but we did a good enough job to win the game. I thought our third period was our best period, (we did a) good job protecting the lead, closing it out.”That performance set the tone. Through six games, Rielly already has six points, tied for third among NHL defensemen behind only Cale Makar and Shayne Gostisbehere. He rediscovered his confidence to jump into the rush, scoring against Montreal and again in an overtime loss to the Seattle Kraken on October 18.One of the most notable changes for Rielly this season is his return to quarterbacking Toronto’s top power-play unit. Last year, Marner handled point duties in a five-forward setup. Now it’s back on Rielly’s shoulders. The early results have been uneven—just two goals in 14 opportunities, a 14.3 percent success rate that ranks tied for 24th in the league. Critics have long pointed out that he lacks a heavy shot from the point, but his vision and passing ability have historically compensated.The success of this man-advantage unit could ultimately determine whether Toronto maintains its scoring pace without Marner and finally breaks through for a deeper playoff run.For Rielly, this year is about more than numbers. It’s about reshaping his place in Toronto after whispers of a trade and doubts about his defensive reliability. His strong start suggests he heard the message from Treliving loud and clear and is ready to embrace the responsibility that comes with being the Leafs’ longest-serving player.“My goal was to leave no stone unturned,” Rielly said this summer when reflecting on his offseason preparation. If his first six games are any indication, that mentality could help turn the Maple Leafs into a more complete team, and perhaps finally give Toronto the kind of blue line stability it has lacked for years. If this resurgence holds, Rielly won’t just silence trade rumors, he could redefine what’s possible for Toronto without Marner.Also Read: Jalen Luypen joins South Carolina Stingrays after leaving Chicago Blackhawks system bringing pro experience and playoff pedigree","Morgan Rielly is having a breakout season with the Toronto Maple Leafs.

It’s definitely not a sign of disintegration,” he told PTI.Bhattacharya revealed that his party, which won 12 of the 19 seats it contested in 2020, would field roughly the same number this time.This year's Mahagathbandhan is more crowded than in 2020, when it included the RJD, Congress, and the three Left parties — CPI(ML), CPI, and CPI(M).Now, Mukesh Sahni’s Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) has joined the fold, while talks are under way with Hemant Soren’s JMM, which wants to contest a few border seats.Congress, meanwhile, has released its first list of 48 candidates even before the seat-sharing formula was finalised - a move that signalled both impatience and self-confidence. Among the key names are state chief Rajesh Ram (Kutumba), CLP leader Shakeel Ahmad Khan (Kadwa), and Youth Congress chief Prakash Garib Das (Bachhwara).In Bachhwara, however, CPI’s Awadesh Roy has also filed papers, creating what insiders call a ""friendly contest"", a common phenomenon in Bihar’s multi-party coalitions.Sources within the bloc told PTI said RJD has tentatively agreed to allot 61 seats to the Congress, with some negotiations still underway over high-stakes constituencies.In India’s electoral playbook, such overlaps between allies are common. When alliances negotiate till the last minute, parties often field 'friendly' candidates in the same seats, using the withdrawal window to clean up overlaps once the deal is sealed.The withdrawal window, which opens after nominations close, gives them room to tidy up overlaps once the final deal is sealed. Candidates in overlapping seats typically withdraw nominations at the last minute, leaving only the officially endorsed name in the fray.With the Phase 1 withdrawal deadline on Monday, and Phase 2 deadline on Thursday, several overlapping candidates are likely to quietly withdraw once the bloc finalises its list.This isn’t the first time Bihar’s opposition has walked into an election season with unresolved seat-sharing issues.In 2020, the RJD and Congress sparred till the eleventh hour over key constituencies, and yet, the alliance went on to deliver one of its strongest performances in years, falling just short of defeating the NDA. The Grand Alliance registered win on 110 seats out of 243. Tejashwi Yadav's RJD emerged as the single largest party in the assembly and he was election leader of opposition in the assembly.The Left parties contested as part of the alliance and performed notably well, especially CPI-ML(L) that won 12 seats. Congress secured 19 seats.That precedent might have made leaders more relaxed about the optics of delay.The NDA, by contrast, has its machinery in motion. The JD(U) and BJP are contesting 101 seats each, with allies LJP (Ram Vilas), RLM, and HAM covering the rest.The BJP’s 40-member star campaigner list, led by PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, signals a high-energy campaign. Chief minister Nitish Kumar, seeking his 10th term, is pitching continuity and stability, while the opposition bets on discontent, voter fatigue and anti-incumbency.The first phase of voting will be held on November 6, the second on November 11, and counting on November 14. For now, the NDA may have the early advantage in optics, but Mahagathbandhan's late start may not necessarily have an impact on the final results.","BJP fields Samrat Choudhary, Vijay Sinha in first list for Bihar polls. Congress and RJD, which are still holding talks, have also declared a few of its candidates for the high-prestige contest. Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar said such coordination takes time.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124628483,imgsize-1153878,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

Women's World Cup prediction: Greenstone Lobo explains which team has best chance to win

NEW DELHI: Four-time champions England booked their spot in the semi-finals of the Women’s World Cup after a nail-biting four-run win over hosts India in Indore on Sunday. England posted a competitive 288/8, anchored by Heather Knight’s classy century, and held their nerve in the field to defend it, despite their bowling, usually their strength, being slightly off-colour.India looked on course for victory, needing just 62 runs from the last 10 overs with seven wickets in hand. But the dismissal of Smriti Mandhana shifted the momentum. The elegant left-hander, who had been anchoring the chase, danced down the track to left-arm spinner Linsey Smith but failed to clear long-off. Soon after, Richa Ghosh and Deepti Sharma fell in quick succession, leaving the tail exposed. As the match slipped away, Mandhana struggled to control her tears, a poignant reminder of how close India had come.Deepti Sharma, after reaching her half-century, attempted a risky slog sweep against Sophie Ecclestone and was caught at deep mid-wicket, sealing England’s victory.""We probably needed 300, but we did well to pull things back and I'm very happy. Didn't contribute much in the last couple of games, so it felt good to come up with a match-winning hundred,"" said Knight, whose 109 off 91 balls, laced with 15 fours and a six, powered England’s innings.England’s openers gave them a brisk start with 73 runs for the first wicket before Knight and captain Nat Sciver-Brunt stitched a 113-run stand to keep the scoreboard ticking. At one point, England seemed set to breach 300, but Knight’s run out during a second run triggered a slowdown. Deepti Sharma finished with four wickets, keeping India in the hunt.The defeat marked India’s third consecutive loss, leaving their next clash against New Zealand a virtual knockout. Both teams are on four points, and only a win in both remaining games, along with favourable results elsewhere, will keep India’s semi-final hopes alive.""Not sure how we lost this game. We had it in the bag. We've worked so hard and when the last five overs slip away from you, it's heartbreaking. This is the third straight game we've lost after coming so close,"" lamented India captain Harmanpreet Kaur, reflecting the anguish felt by the team and particularly by Mandhana, whose heartbreak underlined how agonisingly close India came to victory.","England beat India by four runs to reach the semi-finals of the Women's World Cup.

Women's World Cup prediction: Greenstone Lobo explains which team has best chance to win

SCENARIO 1 – WIN BOTH MATCHES:

India beat New Zealand and Bangladesh.

Result: India qualifies for the semifinals regardless of other results.

SCENARIO 2 – LOSE TO NEW ZEALAND:

India lose to New Zealand.

Then, India hope New Zealand lose their final match against England.

India must beat Bangladesh to advance.

SCENARIO 3 – WIN vs NEW ZEALAND, LOSE vs BANGLADESH:

India beat New Zealand but lose to Bangladesh.

New Zealand must defeat England in their final match.

The team with the better net run-rate (India or New Zealand) will progress to the semifinals.

NEW DELHI: India’s Women’s World Cup campaign is on a knife-edge after another agonising defeat. Chasing a target of 289 against England in Indore on Sunday, India fell just four runs short, marking their third consecutive loss in the tournament. With the win, England secured a semifinal berth alongside South Africa and Australia, leaving only one spot up for grabs. India currently sit fourth in the points table with four points from five matches (NRR +0.526), while their main competitor for the final semifinal place, New Zealand, also has four points but a lower net run-rate (-0.245).The defeat leaves India, co-hosts and pre-tournament favourites, teetering on the brink of elimination, with their semi-final hopes now resting on the outcomes of the remaining two group matches.India will next face New Zealand on Thursday, followed by their final group match against Bangladesh on October 26.A win in both games would guarantee a spot in the semifinals.If they lose to New Zealand, India will need the White Ferns to lose their last match against England and then beat Bangladesh to advance.There’s also a third scenario. If India beat New Zealand but lose to Bangladesh, and New Zealand defeat England, the team with the better net run-rate will progress.Against England, India looked on course for victory for much of the chase. Skipper Smriti Mandhana scored a commanding 88, while Harmanpreet Kaur contributed 70 and Deepti Sharma added 50.With India needing 56 runs off 54 balls and seven wickets in hand, the match seemed under control. However, England fought back brilliantly to clinch the win. Heather Knight’s classy 109 off 91 balls, in her 300th international appearance, had earlier anchored England’s total of 288/8, with Amy Jones contributing 56.India’s bowlers triggered a late collapse, but Linsey Smith and Sophie Ecclestone sealed England’s triumph in the final overs.“It’s a bad feeling when you have put so much hard work in but the last 5-6 overs didn’t go according to the plan,” Harmanpreet said after the match. “Smriti’s wicket was the turning point for us. It’s a heartbreaking moment. Credit to England. They didn’t lose hope, they kept bowling and getting wickets.”","India's World Cup campaign is on a knife-edge after another agonising defeat.

Poll What’s your view on criticism of players on social media? It helps them improve It can be harmful

NEW DELHI: Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin recently found himself in a humorous situation when a person impersonating Australian cricketer Adam Zampa contacted him on WhatsApp, asking for the phone numbers of several Indian players.Ashwin shared screenshots of the conversation on Instagram, captioning it “Fake Adam Zampa tries to strike.” The post quickly went viral, with fans loving Ashwin’s sharp and witty replies to the impersonator.The fake Zampa asked Ashwin for the contact details of players such as Abhishek Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Sanju Samson, Jitesh Sharma, Rinku Singh, and Shivam Dube. Ashwin decided to play along, joking that he would send the list and asking if those names were enough.He then turned the tables by asking the impersonator if he had MS Dhoni’s number. When the fake Zampa replied that he did, Ashwin requested the number in return. The chat ended on a hilarious note, with Ashwin quipping that he was “Compiling in Excel” when the impersonator again pressed for the contacts.This wasn’t Ashwin’s first brush with online impostors. He revealed a similar incident involving someone pretending to be his former Chennai Super Kings teammate Devon Conway.""After the IPL got over, one guy messaged me, claiming to be Devon Conway, 'Hi buddy, how are you?' and I also responded, 'We'll stay in touch. You're playing in MLC; I'll watch the games.' He then asked, 'I've lost Virat Kohli's number, can you share it?' I thought, why is he asking for Virat's number? I thought I should ask him, but I didn't want Devon Conway to misunderstand. Then I picked up Virat Kohli's card and gave him a different number,"" Ashwin shared on his YouTube channel.In a separate development, Ashwin recently defended pacer Harshit Rana after earlier questioning his inclusion in India’s ODI squad against Australia.""I have always reiterated that no player should be attacked below the belt. When the attack becomes too personal, the genre changes. I would like to talk about Sanjay Manjrekar, who has criticised me throughout my career. But I have never held any grudge against him. What they say might be right or wrong, as long as the criticism doesn't get personal, I am fine with it,"" Ashwin stated on his YouTube channel.Ashwin also voiced his concern over the psychological toll of harsh social media criticism on young players.""Assume Harshit sees the reel in which he is being harshly criticised, and he is about to play a match for India, wouldn't he be shattered by this? And if his parents and friends see it, what will be their mindset? We can definitely criticise their skill, their style of cricket and the trade that they are plying. But it shouldn't get personal. It may be funny once or twice, but it shouldn't be a running theme. The reason they are doing this is that there is an audience for it. Negativity sells these days. They sell whatever is in demand. We should avoid consuming such content,"" he added.","Ravichandran Ashwin was contacted on WhatsApp by a person impersonating Adam Zampa.

Poll Do you agree with Shahid Afridi's view on Afghanistan forgetting Pakistan's support? Yes, completely agree No, I disagree Not sure

Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi expressed disappointment with Afghanistan, saying it is regrettable that the country seems to have “forgotten Pakistan’s support.”“I did not expect it to be like this. For the past 50–60 years, we have been taking care of them. I personally look after nearly 350 Afghan families in Karachi,” Afridi told Pakistani media.He also highlighted Pakistan’s decades-long assistance, including hosting millions of refugees and providing direct help to families in need.“I believe that both are neighboring countries, and our message has always been to the people of Afghanistan that both sides should cooperate because we are Muslim countries,” he said.Without mentioning India directly, Afridi urged Afghan leaders to preserve the fraternal relationship and prevent outsiders from exploiting their land against Pakistan.“It is regrettable that instead of sitting down and discussing things directly, you went and shook hands with those who have been involved in terrorism inside Pakistan for a long time. We have always welcomed you, provided you a place, and people have lived, worked, and done business here.It is unfortunate that you went and shook hands with those who are carrying out terrorism inside our country.”The controversy comes after the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) pulled its team from a tri-series in Pakistan next month, following the deaths of three local cricketers in a Pakistani military strike. In a post on X, the ACB said that after the airstrikes, it decided not to send its team to Lahore and Rawalpindi for the November T20 tri-series, which also involved Sri Lanka.

'Unfair at this stage!': Virat Kohli's childhood coach on the treatment of senior duo Virat-Rohit

India face mounting pressure following their disappointing loss in the first ODI against Australia at Perth's Optus Stadium. The match, which was initially anticipated as a celebratory return for Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, resulted in India conceding a 1-0 series lead.Australia won the toss and elected to field first. The Indian batting lineup struggled to cope with the challenging conditions in a rain-affected match.India managed to score 136/9 in their allocated 26 overs, with the target being adjusted to 131 for Australia through DRS. Both Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli had brief stays at the crease, scoring 8 off 14 balls and 0 off 6 balls respectively.In the bowling department, Arshdeep Singh provided an early breakthrough by dismissing Travis Head. However, the Australian team comfortably achieved the target with seven wickets in hand and 29 balls remaining.The entire Indian bowling attack appeared ineffective, with Harshit Rana receiving particularly harsh criticism from fans. His selection for the series has been a topic of debate, with some suggesting his inclusion was influenced by his association with coach Gautam Gambhir Rana's performance in his four-over spell yielded no wickets while conceding 27 runs.This outcome has intensified the scrutiny surrounding his selection and capabilities at the international level.The Indian team now needs to regroup quickly as they prepare for the second match of the three-game series. The upcoming game is scheduled for October 23rd in Adelaide.The pressure will be particularly intense for Harshit Rana, who needs to prove his worth at the international level. A loss in the next match would put India in a difficult position to salvage the series.The match has highlighted concerns about team selection and performance under pressure. The Indian team's ability to bounce back will be tested in the upcoming Adelaide fixture.The rain-interrupted nature of the first match added to the complexity of the game, but the overall performance has raised questions about the team's adaptability in challenging conditions.India's batting collapse in the shortened format and the inability of their bowling unit to defend even a modest target has become a point of concern for the team management.The return of senior players Rohit and Kohli was expected to strengthen the team, but their early dismissals contributed to India's struggles in the match.The upcoming match in Adelaide presents an opportunity for the team to address these issues and level the series. The focus will be on both individual and collective improvement.Australia's commanding performance in chasing down the target has put additional pressure on India to respond strongly in the second ODI.The loss has sparked discussions about team selection strategies and the balance between giving opportunities to new players while maintaining team performance at the international level.The team management faces the challenge of making necessary adjustments while maintaining confidence in their selected players ahead of the crucial second match.","India conceded a 1-0 series lead to Australia in the three-match ODI series.

Kirk Cousins’ Father: Faith, leadership, and lifelong guidance



Mary Ann Cousins : Dedication, family roots, and athletic heritage



Kirk Cousins’ career seemed set when he signed a four-year, $180 million contract with the Atlanta Falcons. The veteran quarterback looked ready to lead, yet the NFL is nothing if not unpredictable. When Atlanta used the No. 8 draft pick to select Michael Penix Jr., the landscape shifted. Suddenly, every practice, meeting, and headline carried a new tension. Amid the uncertainty, one constant has remained: the unwavering support of his parents, Mary Ann and Don Cousins. Their guidance and faith have shaped the quarterback who refuses to fade from the spotlight.Don Cousins, Kirk’s father, is a longtime pastor and author whose faith and leadership left a lasting imprint on his son. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in Biblical Studies from Trinity International University and spent 17 years as an associate pastor at Willow Creek Community Church, one of the nation’s largest Evangelical megachurches. Don later founded Team Development Inc., guiding Christian leaders through speaking, writing, and consulting.His influence on Kirk’s athletic journey is undeniable. Don coached his son in Little League Baseball and encouraged him to play multiple sports, shaping both his skill and discipline.Even personal challenges could not dim his guidance—after being diagnosed with cancer in 2015, Don received a game ball from Kirk following a standout performance against the New Orleans Saints, a moment that reflected their deep bond.Mary Ann Cousins, Kirk’s mother, brought dedication and consistency to the family. Raised in Iowa, she studied nursing at the University of Iowa and spent over three decades as a flight attendant with United Airlines. Her family had a rich athletic tradition: her father, Ralph Woodard, played for the Iowa Hawkeyes, as did her uncle, Dick Woodard, who also had a four-year NFL career.Mary Ann’s influence is equally powerful in shaping Kirk’s character. Her work ethic, loyalty, and support instilled values that extended to his professional life. Alongside Kirk, the Cousins family includes Kyle and Karalyne, both athletes growing up. Kyle played college baseball and now directs Mission Increase Foundation in Orlando, while Karalyne became a doctor in Florida. Kirk’s strong relationship with his parents and siblings provided a stable foundation amid the pressures of the NFL.Through faith, family, and unwavering support, Mary Ann and Don Cousins have played a vital role in Kirk’s journey, proving that a quarterback’s greatest strength often comes from the lessons learned at home.Also Read: Who is Mac Jones’ girlfriend?

Mac Jones’ girlfriend Sophie Scott: From Roll Tide to NFL supporter



Sophie Scott’s support: More than just Football



Mac Jones’ rise from Alabama quarterback to NFL star has been remarkable, but he hasn’t navigated it alone. By his side from the start has been Sophie Scott, his college sweetheart. The couple’s journey began at the University of Alabama, where their shared passions and early support for one another laid the foundation for a lasting relationship. From campus moments to NFL stadiums, Scott has remained a constant cheerleader for Jones’ career.Sophie Scott and Mac Jones started dating in 2019 while both were at Alabama. Scott, raised in St. Louis, Missouri, attended Kirkwood High School before joining the Crimson Tide, ultimately earning a degree in kinesiology and exercise science in December 2020. When Jones was drafted by the New England Patriots in 2021, Scott moved to Boston to support him, often spotted in the stands at practices and games. Their bond deepened through shared experiences, from volunteering at local camps to giving back to the community.Scott has used her Instagram platform to document their life together and model for brands, while Jones himself has dabbled in modeling. “I used to be a child model/actor, or whatever, and that was fun,” Jones told WEEI 93.7’s Merloni & Fauria in 2021.Their shared media presence highlights a couple equally comfortable in the spotlight.Beyond their social posts, the couple shares a love of philanthropy. Jones’ $100,000 donation to the Boys and Girls Club of Metro South in 2022 was a team effort, with Scott joining him at Camp Riverside to engage with children. “From the moment we arrived at the camp, we were greeted by smiling campers just like these who wanted nothing more than to have fun. And that is exactly what we did!” Scott wrote on Instagram, emphasizing the couple’s commitment to supporting young people.Scott’s support for Jones extends far beyond cheering from the stands. She celebrated his NFL draft journey with heartfelt Instagram posts and accompanied him to his first Patriots practice. The Alabama alum even became a viral sensation in 2022 after calmly handling a minor kitchen fire at home, proving her poise under pressure. Whether making fiesta dip or coordinating matching Patriots jerseys with their dog, Scott has shown that her support for Jones is both practical and personal.The couple has maintained a balance between NFL life, personal passions, and memorable experiences, including attending a Taylor Swift concert together in 2023. Their relationship blends shared goals, genuine affection, and a commitment to each other that began in college and continues to grow. Sophie Scott isn’t just Mac Jones’ girlfriend—she’s been an unwavering partner throughout his journey from the University of Alabama to the NFL spotlight.Also Read: Nick Sirianni caught on camera screaming expletives after Eagles’ dramatic win over Vikings","Sophie Scott and Mac Jones started dating in 2019 while both were at Alabama.

The couple, who welcomed their first child, daughter Colette Annalise, in July 2025, are celebrating a milestone that feels years in the making for fans who have followed their journey from flirtatious Instagram likes to walking down the aisle.Their romance began in 2019, when McCaffrey liked one of Culpo’s Instagram posts, a simple gesture that fans now see as the start of something special. Just months later, the two were spotted vacationing in Mexico, confirming the rumors that a new power couple was emerging. By the end of the year, Culpo proudly wore McCaffrey’s jersey at a Panthers game, and soon after, they made their relationship Instagram official.Over the years, the model and the athlete became one another’s biggest supporters, Culpo cheering from the sidelines and McCaffrey publicly defending her from online criticism.The NFL star once wrote, “She doesn’t need my money bubbs,” after a rude comment surfaced, reminding fans that his admiration for her goes beyond fame.Their shared milestones, including McCaffrey’s trade to the 49ers in 2022 and Culpo’s continued modeling success, only strengthened their bond.Their June 2024 wedding in Rhode Island was nothing short of a modern fairytale. Culpo told Vogue her goal was simplicity and grace: “I didn’t want it to exude sex in any way, shape, or form. I wanted it to feel effortless and as if it’s complimenting me, not overpowering me.”Just months after their wedding, Culpo revealed her pregnancy in March 2025 with the heartfelt caption, “next chapter, motherhood 🤍.” Now, with baby Colette’s arrival, the couple’s once-glamorous love story has transformed into a beautiful family narrative.Culpo later reflected on the experience, calling motherhood “the scariest and most rewarding of all experiences.” For two people who built their relationship on faith, loyalty, and admiration, their growing family marks the ultimate touchdown, one filled with love, humility, and the promise of a lifetime together.Also Read: “Never fails to blow me away”: Travis Kelce is all praises for Patrick Mahomes’ relentless drive as Chiefs reclaim their dominance",Olivia Culpo and Christian McCaffrey have welcomed their first child.

Travis Kelce says Patrick Mahomes’ hunger for improvement sets the tone for everyone

Patrick Mahomes’ leadership continues to inspire a championship mentality

Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce once again showed why his bond with Patrick Mahomes is one of the strongest in NFL history, not just on the field, but in the locker room as well. Following the Chiefs’ dominant 31–0 win over the Raiders, Kelce opened up about Mahomes’ mindset and leadership, giving fans a glimpse into what keeps Kansas City’s dynasty alive.Despite the Chiefs facing early-season struggles and public doubts about their offensive chemistry, Kelce made it clear that Mahomes’ work ethic has never wavered. “He’s just always gonna do what he can to get better,” Kelce said, reflecting on his quarterback’s consistent pursuit of excellence.The two-time MVP’s preparation and drive have defined the team’s culture under Andy Reid, creating an atmosphere where complacency simply doesn’t exist. “That’s why I love playing with him,” Kelce added. “That’s why this team is gonna get better throughout the year, because we all have that mentality.”Even after multiple Super Bowl titles, the Chiefs’ leaders continue to emphasize growth over glory. Mahomes’ commitment has turned improvement into a habit, one that teammates mirror in every practice and game.Kelce emphasized that Mahomes’ example sets the “tempo” for the entire roster.“Coach challenges us,” he said. “It’s one of those things... you see Pat doing it and it sets the tempo. It never fails to blow me away how good that guy can be.”That tempo has once again become Kansas City’s signature weapon. After being labeled as “in crisis” just weeks ago, the Chiefs have silenced critics with renewed focus and energy. Kelce’s words highlight a simple truth, Mahomes’ leadership isn’t just about his arm; it’s about his impact.As the Chiefs look to defend their dominance in a stacked AFC, their secret weapon remains the same: an unbreakable partnership between two players who demand greatness from each other and deliver it every time.Also Read: “This boy has my whole heart”: Brittany Mahomes gushes over Patrick as she reveals how their love survived fame and NFL glory","Travis Kelce says Patrick Mahomes' hunger for improvement sets the tone for everyone on the team.

Shane Beamer dismisses Virginia Tech rumors and tells players he’s fully committed to South Carolina

South Carolina’s struggles only reinforce Beamer’s determination to fix the program

Virginia Tech legacy makes headlines, but Beamer’s future remains firmly in Columbia

Amid a turbulent start to the season and swirling speculation linking him to Virginia Tech, South Carolina coach Shane Beamer made it clear on Sunday that his focus is entirely on his team. With the Gamecocks struggling in the SEC, Beamer reassured both players and fans that his commitment to Columbia has not wavered, and his energy is dedicated to turning around a disappointing start.Beamer addressed a CBS Sports report claiming multiple members of Virginia Tech’s search committee were advocating for his return. The 48-year-old coach, who played at Virginia Tech and later served as an assistant under his father, Hall of Famer Frank Beamer, said the report had no basis and his loyalty lies firmly with South Carolina.“I have no idea where that story came from,” Beamer said during his Sunday teleconference. “I have conveyed publicly many times how much I want to be here. This is my dream job. I said that when I came here, nothing has changed. I am pissed off at the way we are performing right now, and it's not acceptable. I came here to win a championship, and right now we're not getting it done, and my focus right now is on getting it fixed. ... We're in a storm right now that I’m going to get us out of.”He told his team personally that any notion of him seeking a “parachute” or soft landing elsewhere was false, emphasizing that all his attention is on improving the team’s performance.Saturday’s 26-7 loss to No. 14 Oklahoma dropped the Gamecocks to 3-4 overall and 1-4 in SEC play, highlighting a rough patch after a 9-4 season last year. Despite the challenges, Beamer insists that this is a moment to double down on accountability and rebuild the team’s culture.“When you’re 3-4, there’s all kinds of noise and chatter and speculation out there about all kinds of things,” Beamer said. “I wanted to make sure our players understood that I’m not focused on anything but getting this right. And that I’m gonna get it right.”Beamer’s connections to Virginia Tech are deep — he played there from 1995-99 and was an assistant under his father from 2011-15. Frank Beamer, South Carolina’s coaching legend, built the Hokies into a national powerhouse. Yet Shane’s commitment to South Carolina is reinforced by a contract through 2030 that pays $8.15 million this season, with a $5 million buyout if he departs early.While speculation may continue, Beamer’s message is clear: his energy, focus, and loyalty remain with the Gamecocks as he works to turn around a difficult season.Also read: Aryna Sabalenka and boyfriend Georgios Frangulis’ relationship timeline: A complete look at their romance, support, and viral moments so far",South Carolina coach Shane Beamer dismissed speculation linking him to Virginia Tech.

Brock Purdy injury update: How long will the 49ers quarterback be sidelined with his toe injury?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/brock-purdy-injury-update-how-long-will-the-49ers-quarterback-be-sidelined-with-his-toe-injury/articleshow/124698465.cms,"Brock Purdy injury update (AP Photos)

Brock Purdy injury update : What it means for the 49ers



49ers’ Season outlook hinges on Brock Purdy’s recovery



San Francisco 49ers fans are holding their breath as Brock Purdy’s lingering turf toe injury drags on, threatening to derail the team’s early-season momentum. What was first seen as a minor setback in Week 1 against the Seahawks has snowballed into a prolonged absence, leaving the 49ers leaning on backup Mac Jones. Every update seems to bring more uncertainty, and with playoff hopes on the line, the pressure is mounting both on Purdy and the team.Purdy suffered the injury in the season opener against the Seattle Seahawks and briefly returned in Week 4 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, only to aggravate the toe. NBC reporter Melissa Stark shared that Purdy described the injury as “so annoying” and cautioned that “any movement in the wrong direction could set him back.” The quarterback is dealing with a hyperextension of his right big toe, which tore stabilizing ligaments under the joint—a serious injury that limits planting and pushing off, vital movements for any quarterback.Despite optimism for a potential Week 8 return against the Houston Texans, Purdy himself stressed that he remains “truly day-to-day.” The cautious approach is understandable, given the severity of turf toe and the risk of further setbacks if he returns too soon.Meanwhile, Mac Jones has guided the 49ers to a 3-1 record in his first five starts, proving capable but still unable to replicate the full impact of Purdy’s presence on the field.Purdy’s absence couldn’t come at a worse time. After signing a five-year, $265 million extension, he is the cornerstone of San Francisco’s offense, and the team’s strategy revolves around his return. With key players like Nick Bosa and Fred Warner sidelined for the season, and multiple injuries across the wide receiver corps, the 49ers are navigating a challenging roster landscape.San Francisco’s medical staff is prioritizing long-term health over rushing Purdy back, hoping that a full recovery will allow him to return stronger for the second half of the season. The team remains atop the NFC West at 4-2, but their ceiling is undeniably higher with Purdy at quarterback. Fans can only wait and hope that the star signal-caller returns at full strength, ready to steer the 49ers deep into the playoffs.Also Read: Who Are Kirk Cousins’ Parents?

Poll Who do you think will perform better in the second ODI? Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma

NEW DELHI: A lot of anticipation surrounded the first ODI in Perth, which India lost by seven wickets (DLS), as two of the game’s stalwarts, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, returned to the side after months. Both players had already retired from T20Is and Tests, making their comeback in the highly anticipated series opener against Australia at Optus Stadium even more significant.For Kohli, it marked his first ODI appearance since lifting the Champions Trophy on March 9 in Dubai.Virat was in a jovial mood from the start, interacting with teammates, sharing laughs, and cracking jokes.Ahead of the match, during the national anthem, he stopped and asked captain Shubman Gill and vice-captain Shreyas Iyer to lead the team and stand first in the line.However, Kohli’s return ended in disappointing fashion, as he was dismissed for a duck.Watch the video here Australia’s spin-bowling all-rounder Cooper Connolly dived to his left to complete the catch at point. Mitchell Starc thus became the second bowler to dismiss Kohli for a duck twice across all internationals, after James Anderson.Before Kohli’s exit, Rohit Sharma’s eagerly awaited comeback was short-lived. Making his 500th international appearance for India, Rohit was dismissed for eight runs by Josh Hazlewood after edging the ball to second slip, where debutant Matthew Renshaw took the catch.India now turn their attention to the second ODI against Australia, scheduled for Thursday at Adelaide Oval, Adelaide, hoping to bounce back and level the series after a tough start in Perth.","India lost the first ODI against Australia by seven wickets in Perth.

Arshdeep Singh Press Conference After IND vs AUS 1st ODI: Praises Captain Gill, Backs Virat Kohli

NEW DELHI: Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has expressed confidence that Indian stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma will bounce back strongly in the second ODI against Australia in Adelaide, following their disappointing returns in Perth. Gavaskar said it would be no surprise if the two senior batters deliver big scores, emphasising that it’s only a matter of time and practice before they regain their rhythm.Kohli and Rohit returned to international cricket after a seven-month break but struggled on Perth’s challenging surface, scoring 0 and 8 respectively. Australia capitalised on India’s batting collapse to secure a comfortable seven-wicket win, taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Gavaskar defended the duo, stressing that adjusting to Perth’s bounce after such a long layoff was always going to be difficult.“They were playing on probably the bounciest pitch in Australia. It wasn’t going to be easy, especially for players who haven’t played international cricket for a couple of months. It was challenging even for Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer, who play regularly,” Gavaskar was quoted as saying by India Today.The former India captain remained optimistic about India’s prospects, pointing out that once Kohli and Rohit spend more time at the crease and in the nets, they’ll quickly rediscover their touch.“India are still a very, very good team. Don’t be surprised if Rohit and Kohli score big in the next two games. The more they play, the more time they spend in the nets, the quicker they’ll find their rhythm. Once they’re back among the runs, India’s total will be 300, 300-plus,” Gavaskar added.The second ODI in Adelaide presents ideal conditions for a turnaround, particularly for Kohli, who has an outstanding record at the venue.In four ODIs at Adelaide Oval, he has scored 244 runs at an average of 61, including two centuries.His Test record there is even more remarkable, with 537 runs in five matches at an average of 53.70, featuring three hundreds.","Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma returned to international cricket after a seven- month break.

Speaking to the media on Saturday, ahead of the must-win match against England at the Holkar Stadium in Indore, Sharma stated, “We have lost two matches, but our morale is very good because we played two good matches at the start. ”Hosts India are set to resume their campaign after a week’s break and must win at least two of their remaining three matches to guarantee a spot in the semifinals.

Cowboys’ defensive challenges with Trevon Diggs sidelined for Commanders clash



Trikweze Bridges and Caelen Carson to fill key roles in Dallas’ secondary



The Dallas Cowboys will face a major defensive challenge this Sunday as star cornerback Trevon Diggs has been sidelined for the matchup against the Washington Commanders. Head coach Brian Schottenheimer confirmed Friday that Diggs entered concussion protocol following an accident at home on Thursday night, ruling him out for the upcoming game.Diggs’ absence comes at a critical time for the Cowboys, whose defense is struggling this season, ranking near the bottom in both yards and points allowed. Despite this setback, Schottenheimer emphasized that the team’s defensive strategy remains intact. “It doesn’t change. We adjust always on defense when we get into gamedays anyway,” he said, signaling confidence in the team’s game plan against a high-powered Commanders offense.To fill the void left by Diggs, the Cowboys will rely on backup players such as Trikweze Bridges and Caelen Carson. Bridges has impressed during practices, showing readiness to step up, while Carson could return to bolster the secondary. Schottenheimer underscored the NFL’s “next man up” philosophy, stressing that the team is prepared to adapt and execute its plan despite missing a key starter.The Cowboys’ defensive struggles make Diggs’ absence particularly significant.Analysts expect the Commanders to test Dallas’ secondary early and often, putting pressure on linebackers and safeties to cover gaps and force turnovers. The performance of Bridges and Carson could be decisive in keeping the Cowboys competitive and limiting scoring opportunities for Washington.Player safety remains a top priority, and details about the severity of Diggs’ condition are still emerging. Schottenheimer confirmed that Diggs was evaluated by the team’s medical staff on Friday, with updates pending as he progresses through concussion protocol.

Vegas Golden Knights goalie Carter Hurt has made his long-awaited return to the NHL after his controversial long court battle. After a prolonged absence from professional hockey due to the charges pressed against him of sexual assault in a high-profile case, Hurt is joining the Vegas Golden Knights on a professional contract tryout, as the team claimed on Thursday. However, reports suggest that Hart and the others are not eligible to play in games until December 1, as part of the league’s reinstatement process for him. Let’ take a closer look at what the goaltender has to say about his return to the league after a long hiatus. NHL goalie Carter Hurt has made his long-awaited return to the league on Thursday, as announced by the Vegas Golden Knights on Thursday. The goalie has joined the team on a professional tryout contract basis, following a long-fought legal battle. Earlier, Hart played six seasons with the Philadelphia Flyers before stepping away from the game amid significant legal and organizational developments.Following the signing of the contract with the Golden Knights, the goaltender stated, “I’m beyond grateful, excited, and honored to be part of the Golden Knights.” He further said, “It’s been a long road to get back to this point, getting back to playing the game of hockey, the game that I love.I’ve been out of the game for a year and a half now. I’ve learned a lot. I’ve grown a lot. Just excited to move forward.”On his joining, the Vegas Golden Knights officially announced that, “Following the reinstatement decision agreed on by the National Hockey League and the National Hockey League Players’ Association, goaltender Carter Hart will be joining the Vegas Golden Knights organization.”In addition to this, the team stated, “The Golden Knights are aligned with the process and assessment that the NHL and NHLPA made in their decision. We remain committed to the core values that have defined our organization from its inception and expect that our players will continue to meet these standards moving forward.”Carter Hart is resuming his career at the age of 27 with the Vegas Golden Knights after spending his first six seasons playing for Philadelphia. The Flyers last month ruled out bringing back Hart, whose camp communicated to general manager Daniel Briere that a fresh start was a better option.In 2024, he was among five members of Canada’s 2018 World Junior Championship team charged with sexual assault in relation to an alleged incident in London, Ontario. On July 24, 2025, Ontario Superior Court Justice Maria Carroccia acquitted Hart and the others, citing insufficient credible evidence to support the charges.After a prolonged legal battle, the NHL and NHL Players’ Association later imposed a reinstatement process, stating that the players are now eligible to sign contracts beginning October 15, 2025, and to participate in regular-season games from December 1, 2025.","NHL goalie Carter Hurt has made his long-awaited return to the league on Thursday, as announced by the Vegas Golden Knights on Thursday.
