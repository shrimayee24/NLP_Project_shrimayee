Kieron Pollard of Southern Brave delivered a match-winning performance by hitting Rashid Khan of Trent Rockets for five consecutive sixes during The Hundred on Saturday. His explosive batting helped Southern Brave to chase down a target of 127, achieving victory with just one ball to spare at the Rose Bowl in Southampton.Pollard's game-changing performance began when Brave needed 49 runs off the last 20 balls.Rashid Khan had been economical with figures of 1/10 from his first 15 deliveries, but Pollard dismantled his bowling in a single over.Pollard smashed the first two balls over cow corner and the long-off region, followed by a straight hit back over Rashid's head with the third ball. A powerful shot over deep mid-wicket came next, and Pollard topped off the over with a final six over long-off. This assault reduced the runs required to 19 off 15 balls.Despite being dismissed shortly after his blitz, Pollard’s rapid 45 off 23 balls had already shifted the momentum in Southern Brave's favor. The team ultimately won the contest by two wickets with just one ball remaining.Earlier in the game, Tom Banton top-scored for Trent Rockets with 30 runs, helping his team to post a competitive total of 126/8.Reflecting on his performance against Rashid Khan, Pollard acknowledged their shared history and familiarity with each other's play.""I've played a lot against him, and he's gotten me out many times. But I knew the lines and lengths he was likely to bowl,"" Pollard said.""I just backed myself - if he bowled short, I was going across; if he went full, I was going to hit straight. He bowled three fuller balls, and they were right in my arc. At that point, I couldn't hold back, I had to go for maximums. But Rashid is a world-class bowler; we've played a lot against each other,"" he added.Pollard's performance not only secured a crucial victory for Southern Brave but also underscored his reputation as one of the most formidable hitters in the sport.","Kieron Pollard hit five consecutive sixes during The Hundred on Saturday.

The 22-year-old added that it was “such a great honour to carry the national flag”.Manu’s only disappointment was that she couldn’t capture some of the treasured moments on her mobile phone. “Manu lost her phone when she returned to Delhi. She put it in airplane mode and left it on her seat and forgot to take it with her after landing in Delhi. It was a big loss as it was the same phone that was gifted to her by the official sponsor at the Tokyo Games,” sources told TOI. “A complaint was lodged with the carrier and we searched in the lost-andfound items. But Manu’s mobile was not there,” sources added.Sreejesh, meanwhile, had no such problems and he was seen clicking away after they took turns to wave the national flag.Wrestler Reetika Hooda was among the lucky few in the Indian contingent who got to stay back to be part of the closing ceremony. “I felt very good to represent my country in front of such a large audience. It was a bitter sad moment for me as I missed out on a medal,” said Reetika, the first Indian wrestler to qualify in the women’s heavyweight category.For Reetika, the big moment was not to watch Hollywood star Tom Cruise take the Games flag to Los Angeles but to meet and greet Cuban wrestling legend Mijain Lopez. Lopez won his first gold at Beijing in 2008 and he retired here after winning his fifth straight gold in the men’s Greco Roman 130-kg category. “I’m not even a big fan of Bollywood, so Hollywood is very far,” she said with a smile. “But to meet and pose for a picture with Lopez sir was a priceless moment,” she told TOI.",Manu Bhaker and PR Sreejesh carry the national flag at the closing ceremony.

NEW DELHI: Among Indian athletes, badminton queen PV Sindhu was a prominent medal contender heading into the Paris Olympics.

I know it’s painful because you prepare for four years, and sometimes luck isn’t on your side. It’s definitely tough, but we have to work hard and try again,"" Nehwal said.""I met Manu in January this year, and she was quite sure she would win a medal this time. She achieved that, so hats off to her confidence and preparation.

Indian players must play abroad, even if it's in lower division

NEW DELHI: Manolo Marquez , the newly appointed head coach of the Indian football team , described his new role as a 'dream come true' but emphasized that in the future, the national team should ideally be managed by an Indian.The 55-year-old Spaniard's tenure, effective from last month, will span three years, during which he will fulfill a dual role as both the head coach of FC Goa and the national team.Marquez, who will manage FC Goa during the 2024-25 season alongside his national team responsibilities, will transition to exclusively coaching the Indian team from 2025.""Apart from Spain, India is the country where I have spent the most number of years. Long time ago, I thought I would like to be a national team head coach and I am here. It is a dream come true,"" Marquez said while addressing his first press conference after his appointment as India head coach.""In the future, the national team coach has to be an Indian because he (Indian) will know better how the country works, knows the people of different parts of India. So, this has to be the target of Indian football in the coming years,"" he added.Marquez has been active in Indian football since 2020, having spent three successful seasons with Hyderabad FC. He also had a notable season with FC Goa, achieving a third-place finish in the Indian Super League (ISL ) this year. His upcoming international assignments include the three-team Intercontinental Cup, to be held in Hyderabad from September 3 to 9, featuring Syria and Mauritius alongside India.Following the Intercontinental Cup, Marquez will lead the team in the VFF Tri-Nation Series in Vietnam from October 9 to 15, competing against Lebanon and hosts Vietnam. Both tournaments will take place during the FIFA international match window, and the national camp for the Intercontinental Cup is scheduled to commence on August 30 or 31.Addressing concerns about potential conflicts of interest while serving as both India head coach and FC Goa manager, Marquez stated that this situation, although unusual, is not unprecedented.""It's not a normal situation, no doubt, but it's not the first time and won't be the last time regarding this situation.""I checked, in international level, there were big names earlier in same situation and in India, I am told there were many (such cases) earlier.""National team plays when there is no ISL. You won't have any doubt that we will work very hard for the national team.""Having failed to make it to the third round of the joint 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 Asian Cup qualifiers under Stimac, India are yet to qualify for the continental showpiece. The team will have to play in the qualifying round of the 2027 Asian cup from March next year onwards.""The target is to improve the level of Indian football -- individually as players as well as a team. No doubt, that will not be immediate but will take time,"" said the experienced coach who has managed several lower division sides in the Spanish league.""Our target is to win every match, but the long term one is to qualify for the Asian Cup in 2027. We will get 6-7 games before the Asian Cup qualifiers,"" Marquez said.""So, these two upcoming tournaments (Intercontinental Cup and VFF Tri-Nation Series) are important so that we can be in good seeding during the draw (for the Asian Cup qualifiers) in December this year.""""The best players will have to play at the best level, against stronger opponents. That is how you grow as a player. That is why more Indian players should play in the ISL. That is why my advice to Indian players is to play abroad even if it is lower division leagues.""They will learn more and improve more (by playing abroad). But the Indian players are comfortable playing in the ISL, in India but I want them to play abroad,"" Marquez said, adding that Indian football has improved in the last five years but can improve further.Marquez also said he will pick I-League players for the national team, if they have the requisite level.Asked what is lacking in an Indian player as seen in his five-year association with the country at club level, he said, ""It's the mentality of the players, we need to improve on this. We have to develop that we can do something, we have to be stronger in mentality.""If the mentality is right, we will get good results. I am optimistic that Indian football will improve step by step and reach the desired place.""",Manolo Marquez is the new head coach of the Indian football team.
