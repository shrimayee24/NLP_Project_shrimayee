African footballers bring joy to cyclone-battered Bengal Mousuni Island,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/african-footballers-bring-joy-to-cyclone-battered-bengal-mousuni-island/articleshow/115641265.cms,"MOUSUNI ISLAND (SOUTH 24 PARGANAS): The afternoon sun hung low over the Khasmahal ground in southern Bengal's Mousuni, casting long shadows across the freshly chalked sidelines. Vendors moved through the crowd, balancing trays of puffed rice and tamarind water. On the pitch, the ball darted from foot to foot with the rhythm of a heartbeat. In the thick of it was Tinni Aziz from Niger.With a deft flick, he spun past a defender, his movements as fluid as the tides surrounding Mousuni, one of the remotest permanently inhabited islands of the Sundarbans delta , nearly 200km south of Kolkata, reports Sudipto Das.The crowd roared in unison as he sent a perfect through ball to Issiaka Kwasi from Ivory Coast, who weaved through two defenders with dazzling footwork before firing a low, curling shot into the corner of the net. The goalkeeper's dive came a second too late.The match wasn't just a game on this isolated island in the Bay of Bengal. It was a rare moment of joyful reprieve from the rising tides, eroding shores, and devastating cyclones.Mousuni recently came alive with the cheers of football fans as it hosted a three-day, nine-a-side football tournament featuring 33 players from African nations such as Ivory Coast, Senegal, Ghana, Cameroon, and Niger.Some have ventured into the hinterlands lately. One in every four players in the Mousuni tournament was from Africa, underscoring the rising prominence of ""khep"" football - local tournaments where players are paid per match. The event, which concluded Sunday, featured 16 teams competing for a prize pool of Rs 2 lakh.Mousuni, battered by cyclones like Bulbul (2019), Amphan (2020), and Yaas (2021), has faced severe challenges, including the destruction of its primary cash crop betel leaf and the relentless erosion of its coastline. Yet, the past two years have seen improved yields of paddy and betel leaf, allowing villagers to invest in organising the tournament.""Out of the 16 teams, 13 belong to Mousuni, and the others were from the mainland,"" said Saral Das, an organizer and farmer who owns 13.5 bighas of land. ""This year, Mousuni villagers have contributed substantial amounts of money to support the clubs,"" added Chayan Kumar Bhattacharya, another committee member.Both Tinni and Issiaka played for Jai Maa Vishalakhhi, a team managed by betel leaf farmer Sagar Maity. ""This year I hired three African players, including two strikers and a fullback,"" said Maity, whose team became one of the tournament's highlights.Bablu Mondal, a farmer from Kusumtala village, formed Naba Football Sangha (NFT) this year and spent Rs 2.5 lakh on his team, including hiring four African players.For Mousuni, where climate change is an everyday reality, football offered a brief but powerful escape for its residents - many of whom have faced displacement due to erosion, which has reduced the island's size to just 44sq km. While many younger villagers have migrated to other states for work, the event brought a welcome distraction and a sense of hope.","Mousuni is one of the remotest permanently inhabited islands of the Sundarbans delta.

Last season's wonder Shashank Singh was retained for INR 5.5 crore, while Punjab Kings remain confident of Prabhsimran Singh's batting acumen, retaining his services for INR 4 crore.Shashank Singh, known for his ability to contribute as a middle-order power-hitter and part-time bowler, earned his retention after last season, where he single-handedly won PBKS a couple of games and played some adorable cameos on some occasions.Retaining the young wicketkeeper-batter Prabhsimran Singh has reflected PBKS’ faith in his explosive top-order potential and ability to impact games with the bat and gloves.PBKS, earlier known as Kings XI Punjab, have had a roller-coaster journey in the IPL since their inception in 2008. Despite flashes of brilliance, such as their runner-up finish in 2014, inconsistency has been a recurring issue.Frequent leadership changes and inconsistent performances have hindered their title quest. The addition of Ricky Ponting as the head coach points to a more tactical and focused approach, emphasizing stability and long-term success.Entering the auction with a mammoth INR 110.5 crore, PBKS were in an enviable position to rebuild their squad. The team was focusing on securing a consistent top-order batter, experienced finishers, and specialist bowlers, especially for the death overs.","Punjab Kings complete squad list for IPL 2025.

The Indian Premier League ( IPL ) auctions have always been a stage for intense bidding wars, showcasing the financial muscle of franchises and their willingness to invest in top-tier talent. Over the years, the price tags of marquee players have reached astronomical figures, reflecting the growing significance of cricket’s shortest format and the league's global appeal.The much-anticipated IPL 2025 Mega Auction is set to take place on November 24-25 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Before the auction, let’s take a closer look at the top five most expensive buys in IPL history, highlighting the players who shattered records with their staggering auction prices.Australian fast-bowling maestro Mitchell Starc became the most expensive player in IPL history during the 2024 auction. KKR secured Starc for a jaw-dropping Rs 24.75 crore, a testament to his lethal skills with the ball. Known for his ability to swing the ball at high speeds and deliver pinpoint yorkers, Starc’s addition bolstered KKR’s bowling lineup significantly.Another Australian pacer, Pat Cummins, claimed the second spot on the list after being acquired by Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs 20.50 crore in the same auction as Starc. Cummins is a complete package, offering sharp bowling, athletic fielding, and the ability to contribute with the bat. His leadership qualities, honed during his tenure as Australia’s Test captain, added extra value to his profile.Sam Curran’s acquisition by Punjab Kings in 2023 for Rs 18.50 crore was historic, making him the most expensive player at the time. Curran’s performances in the 2022 T20 World Cup, where he was named Player of the Tournament, made him a prime target. His versatility as a left-arm seamer and a middle-order batter who thrives in crunch situations gave Punjab a reliable match-winner.Mumbai Indians broke the bank in 2023 to acquire Australian all-rounder Cameron Green for Rs 17.50 crore. Known for his explosive batting at the top of the order and his seam-bowling capabilities, Green added a new dimension to Mumbai’s setup. His adaptability and raw potential made him a hot commodity at the auction.Chennai Super Kings secured English all-rounder Ben Stokes for Rs 16.25 crore in 2023. A proven match-winner, Stokes brought immense value to CSK with his aggressive batting, crafty bowling, and outstanding leadership qualities. His experience in guiding England to major tournament victories made him a prized asset.The IPL auctions have consistently pushed the boundaries of player valuations, underlining the league’s status as the pinnacle of T20 cricket. These record-breaking purchases reflect not just the immense talent of these cricketers but also the franchises’ trust in their ability to deliver under pressure.","IPL 2025 Mega Auction is set to take place on November 24-25 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Can Ricky Ponting build a match-winning Punjab Kings squad at IPL 2025 auction?

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings (PBKS) made a significant move right at the start of the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) 2025 mega auction by using their Right to Match ( RTM ) card to secure Arshdeep Singh for Rs 18 crore.This strategic use of the RTM card ensured that PBKS retained one of their most reliable players, showcasing the impact of the newly modified RTM rules.The RTM card, reintroduced for the 2025 season, operates with a fresh twist.Previously, teams could simply match the highest bid to retain their player.However, this year, if a team exercises RTM, the bidding team is allowed to raise their offer, creating a compelling back-and-forth dynamic. This change was evident in the intense bidding war for Arshdeep.The auction began with Punjab’s star pacer, Arshdeep Singh, being the first player under the hammer. Starting from a base price of Rs 2 crore, Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Delhi Capitals (DC) kicked off the bidding.The price quickly escalated as Gujarat Titans (GT),Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), and Rajasthan Royals (RR) joined the fray, each determined to secure the left-arm pacer.The competition reached a fever pitch when Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) entered the race, eventually outbidding everyone with a staggering offer of Rs 15.75 crore.Just as SRH looked set to claim Arshdeep, PBKS decided to play their RTM card. SRH countered with an increased bid of Rs 18 crore, pushing PBKS to make a critical decision. After some deliberation, PBKS executed their RTM card, matching the Rs 18 crore bid and reclaiming their prized bowler.This strategic move not only secured Arshdeep Singh’s services but also demonstrated Punjab’s commitment to retaining key players from their core squad.The high-stakes drama set the tone for the auction and underscored the importance of the reintroduced RTM card in shaping IPL 2025 rosters.","Punjab Kings used their Right to Match ( RTM ) card to secure Arshdeep Singh for Rs 18 crore.

Right-To-Match Card

: Explained

NEW DELHI: The Indian Premier League IPL ) 2025 auction promises high drama as the event unfolds in the picturesque city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.With the BCCI choosing the iconic Abadi Al Johar Arena to host the mega auction on November 24-25, the cricketing world’s eyes are set on the future composition of the 10 franchises.The decision to hold the auction overseas marks a significant moment for the league, with Jeddah outpacing other speculated venues like Dubai and London.The 15,000-seater arena, known for its grandeur, ensures a fitting backdrop to the event, while participating franchise delegations will be housed at the luxurious Shangri-La Hotel.In an auction reduced from 1,574 initial registrants to a sharp pool of 574, including 39 fresh additions, the stakes are high for every team. Notably, this year’s auction coincides with the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Perth, Australia.To ensure no clash with cricketing action, the auction is strategically timed to begin at 3:30 PM IST, aligning with the end of the Test’s daily play.A major twist this year is the reintroduction of the Right-To-Match (RTM) card, a feature last seen in 2018. Unlike before, when teams could simply match a winning bid to retain a player, the rules now allow the highest-bidding team to increase their offer.For instance, if a player is bid for Rs 5 crore and the original team uses RTM, the winning team can raise their bid—say to Rs 10 crore—forcing the original team to either match the new bid or let the player go.This rule adds a strategic layer, encouraging intense bidding wars and challenging teams to balance their budgets while retaining top talent.As teams vie to assemble their dream squads, the IPL 2025 auction is set to blend cricket ’s dynamic strategy with the glitz and grandeur of Saudi Arabia.","The Indian Premier League IPL 2025 auction is set to take place in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

She knows everything that goes on behind the scenes, what goes on in the head when you don't play as well, you make a few mistakes after getting yourself in.""""I just wanted to contribute to the team's cause. I do not want to hang around just for the sake of it. I take pride in performing for the country. Feels amazing. The fact that she is here makes it more special.""Acting captain Jasprit Bumrah recalled Kohli and Nitish Kumar Reddy to the field briefly after Kohli's century celebration.This century marked a significant personal milestone for Kohli, as it was his 100th hundred in professional cricket across all formats.In Test cricket, Kohli has now amassed 30 centuries in 119 matches, accumulating 9,145 runs at an impressive average of 48.13, with 30 centuries and 31 fifties.","Virat Kohli scores 81st international century in Border-Gavaskar Trophy series opener in Perth.

We tried everything but nothing worked against Virat Kohli: Josh Hazlewood,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/we-tried-everything-but-nothing-worked-against-virat-kohli-josh-hazlewood/articleshow/115627867.cms,"(AP Photo)

NEW DELHI: Australian fast bowler Josh Hazlewood acknowledged the effectiveness of Virat Kohli 's batting, stating that Australia attempted various strategies to dismiss him but were unsuccessful. Kohli's century, his 30th in Test matches, was instrumental in India establishing a commanding lead in the first Test of the series.""We cycled through a few plans. He batted really well.He's a good player. He batted well. We sort of hung it outside off for a bit with an offside field. We tried straight. We tried the bounces. We tried a lot of things. He negated everything. So, yes, credit to him. He batted well,"" said Hazlewood on Kohli's unbeaten 100 which took him past Sir Donald Bradman's 29 Test hundreds.Hazlewood conceded that Australia faces a daunting challenge to salvage the match, as they ended the first day trailing by 522 runs with only seven wickets remaining. He admitted that the Australian bowlers endured a demanding day, particularly the fast bowlers, who conceded 290 runs in 84 overs for a mere return of four wickets.""Yes, it's up there. It probably speaks for itself,"" Hazlewood said when asked if that was one of the harder days he had had in the field.Hazlewood acknowledged the difficulty of the situation, pointing to India's substantial run accumulation and the formidable partnerships they forged.""They piled on the runs and had a couple of really big partnerships there. It was hard work out there. Following it at certain stages.""Hazlewood highlighted the impact of the new ball, noting that it provided some assistance, but once the ball softened, batting became easier. He observed fluctuations in the pitch's behavior towards the end of the day, suggesting that it was an aspect the Australian batters would need to monitor closely.""The new ball probably does a little bit. But, if you get through that, then it's a bit easier batting. We saw a little bit up and down towards the end of the day, obviously. So, that'll be something the batters will be watching tomorrow.""Looking ahead, Hazlewood emphasized the responsibility now rested with the Australian batsmen to perform, stating his intention to shift his focus to preparations for the subsequent Test match.""I'm probably looking mostly towards next test and what plans we can do against these batters. I guess the batters just sticking to what they do, their preparation.""Addressing the substantial support India enjoys from spectators, even in Australia, Hazlewood indicated that the Australian team was accustomed to this phenomenon.""We're used to that now. I think wherever you play India, it's an Indian home ground. I reckon the last few tours have been similar. The one-day series in Australia are similar. Yes, we're all used to it now.""Hazlewood maintained a composed outlook despite India's dominant position, recognizing that cricket can be unpredictable and emphasizing that Australia had also experienced periods of dominance in the past.""I think that's sort of the way the game flows sometimes. We've been on the other end of it as well a lot of times when we're piling it on and next minute we come out and take a few quick runs late in the afternoon. You see it both ways.""""They're obviously well in front on this one and they're doing the damage. That's just sort of ebbs and flows of the game.""Hazlewood explained the decision to use Pat Cummins , the Australian captain, as the night watchman, indicating that it was a strategic choice based on Nathan Lyon's workload during India's innings. He anticipated both Cummins and Lyon fulfilling this role at various points throughout the series.""We've just been talking the last few weeks about potentially having two options and Gaz (Lyon's nickname) obviously put a fair shift in their bowling. Pat put his hand up to do it tonight. I think we'll see both guys used throughout the series. ""Hazlewood defended Cummins's performance in the match, dismissing concerns about his lack of recent match practice due to not playing a domestic game leading up to the Test. He praised Cummins's pace and bounce, suggesting that any rustiness in the first innings was overcome as the match progressed.""I think he bowled the most out of the quicks. His pace was probably the pick of the quicks as well. He kept his pace up the whole game. His bounces were on track most of the time. He looked his normal self to me. I can usually pick up with the other two quicks when they're a little bit off and I didn't see any sort of signs of that.""""Maybe a little bit of a rust in the first innings. You sort of take the freshness I think over that and throughout this game he obviously I think got better and you'll just see him get better as he goes along I think. So the freshness I think trumps playing that Shield game for him.""Hazlewood maintained a positive outlook despite the challenging situation Australia faces, emphasizing the length of the series and the importance of extracting valuable lessons from the opening game. He stressed the need for the Australian batsmen to spend time at the crease, aiming to score substantial runs and challenge India's fast bowlers.""It's just again the batters sticking to their plans tomorrow, batting some time. It's obviously a long series. It's a five-match series. So if we can put some overs into their top quicks, I guess that's probably the couple of goals that we need to tick off tomorrow.""""If a couple of guys find some form and score an 80-90 or even 100, that's probably the positives we can take out of it.""",India lead Australia by 522 runs after first day of first Test in New Delhi.

'To play alongside MS Dhoni...': Ravichandran Ashwin on returning to CSK at IPL mega auction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/to-play-alongside-ms-dhoni-ravichandran-ashwin-on-returning-to-csk-at-ipl-mega-auction/articleshow/115641805.cms,"Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Ravichandran Ashwin during IPL match in 2011. (Photo by Prakash Singh/AFP via Getty Images)

NEW DELHI: As Chennai Super Kings looked to add players whose skill sets are suited to conditions at the Chepauk, which is known for producing slow and low turners, the five-time champions bought India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin for Rs 9.75 crore during the opening day of the auction in Jeddah on Sunday.Having made his debut for CSK in 2009, Ashwin was a part of the team's title-winning campaign in 2010 and 2011.Ashwin returns to CSK after having played for Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings), Rising Pune Supergiants, Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals CSK shared a video of Ashwin on their official X handle where Ashwin thanks the team for picking him up.The video has Ashwin saying in Tamil, ""They say life is a circle. From 2008 till 2015, I wore the yellow jersey and played for CSK and I am always indebted to them. Whatever I learnt at CSK, has helped me hugely in my international cricket journey as well till today. It's almost 10 years since I last played for CSK, 2015 was my last season with CSK. I don't know how to express it, I was picked by CSK again in this auction.""Ashwin entered the IPL auction with a base price of Rs 2 crore, and CSK wasted no time making the first move for their original ""Super King.""Ashwin continues, ""Words like homecoming, price, etc., are there, but something that is very nostalgic for me is the fact that CSK fought for me in the same way that they fought for me way back in the 2011 IPL auction. It was a trip down memory lane for me. It is a very special feeling. I have seen a lot about our ""Anbuden"" fans on social media for the last 10 years. When I used to play for RR, I used to feel bad that I am playing against the CSK fans. They won't shout whether I am bowling or batting. Now once again, to play in front of the same fans, to play in front of that ever growing fandom, I am so looking forward to it. I am so glad to be back, to play alongside MS Dhoni and ofcourse to play under Ruturaj Gaikwad. Thank you once again.""Lucknow Super Giants joined the bidding war against CSK but eventually bowed out, only for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) to step in and compete fiercely.The battle between RCB and CSK intensified until RCB decided to drop out, paving the way for Rajasthan Royals (RR) to join the fray.With the bid climbing to Rs 6 crore, CSK re-entered, pushing it to Rs 6.25 crore and then escalating further to Rs 7.25 crore. RR responded strongly, taking it to Rs 7.50 crore and then Rs 8 crore, as both teams recognized the value of having a seasoned spinner like Ashwin, especially with limited experienced options in the market.The Royals and Super Kings went head-to-head in an intense bidding slugfest. The price eventually soared to Rs 9.75 crore, with CSK securing the bid as RR decided to tap out.",Chennai Super Kings buy Ravichandran Ashwin for Rs 9.75 crore. Ashwin made his debut for CSK in 2009 and was part of the team's title-winning campaign in 2010 and 2011.

Lucknow Super Giants seek KL Rahul's replacement at IPL 2025 auction

NEW DELHI: As Rishabh Pant became the most expensive cricketer in IPL history , Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) management revealed that they invested in his positive character when they decided to pay Rs 27 crore for him on Sunday.""Pant was our No. 1 target going into the auction.We planned our auction strategy around him. We looked at the kind of impact he has on a game, proven match-winner, his positive outlook and resilience,"" Sanjeev Goenka told TOI from Jeddah after Pant’s bid.""He is a fighter. What he brings to the table is well established. It was a unanimous decision between Zaheer (Khan), (Justin) Langer, Shashwat (Goenka) and me. All our buys so far have been match-winners,"" added Goenka.For LSG mentor Zaheer, it is a bet on Pant's evolution as a leader who can infuse positivity in a group. ""I have seen him when I was in Delhi Daredevils (now Capitals) and he started his IPL journey. The way he has evolved as a cricketer is remarkable. His understanding of the game has grown. He thinks about the game. I had noticed the spark in him when he was a 19-year-old in Delhi,"" Zaheer said.Pant has often been subjected to criticism for his flamboyant brand of game. ""He can react to the various situations of a game. He has done a lot of special things in his career. I think this is the right time for him to go one step up as a leader. His positive mindset can have a big impact on a team,"" Zaheer added before offering a clarification: ""We haven't decided on the captaincy yet. But then he is always a leader. Pant, Nicholas Pooran, Ravi Bishnoi and David Miller are all expected to be part of the leadership group.""Head coach Langer, who has seen him closely during India's previous two tours Down Under, reckoned Pant's attitude off the field is special. ""I have seen him in Australia. The ability on the field aside, he is a character that can lift a team,"" said the Aussie.""I haven't spoken to him much. But I'll go to Adelaide for the second Test, give him a hug and root for Australia,"" he laughed.Once a player is paid such a hefty amount, there is always an added pressure of delivering results. ""Just wait and see how the season unfolds and how we help him de-stress,"" Goenka quipped.","Lucknow Super Giants owner, mentor, coach tell TOI that wicket-keeper's positive mindset can lift team.

Man vs Machine has always been a common theme in competitive sport, when human and intuitive play is up against precise and programmed cold bloodedness.Usually, when any Indian sportsperson faces a Chinese rival, it is generally dubbed as Man vs Machine, the south Asian mix of skill and frailties pitted against extreme Oriental preparedness. But that perception is reversed for the World Chess Championship this time as Ding Liren is showing his human side, at least in the build-up to the match, while Gukesh is managing himself superbly.The 14-game match starts in Singapore on Monday.The 18-year-old Indian challenger is not playing exactly computer moves. He is all human but with computer-like precision and a deeper sense of calculation. On the other hand, Ding has suffered from mental issues and has frequently been showing his vulnerability under full media glare.Henrik Carlsen, the one who knows what it takes to groom multiple world champions, told Take Take Take, ""Gukesh is playing at the peak of human capacity. Way up there with Magnus (Carlsen), (Vladimir) Kramnik and (Garry) Kasparov. He is just a formidable bull. I am not sure what is going to stop him. Ding will try certainly. He is a difficult player to face at his best.""But Gukesh is fallible too. After all, unlike a chess engine, he will also have to handle emotions and time trouble.Henrik said: ""If Game 1 is not a challenge for Gukesh, he is not human. From our experience in Chennai in 2013, I can say that it’s quite a challenge. Magnus was trembling with nerves.""Therein lies a catch. Most experts believe that the starting phase of the series of games will be of great significance and hence Gukesh should strike early, and Ding must remain strong in this phase.GM Abhijit Kunte, captain of India women’s gold medal team at Chess Olympiad, said, ""Gukesh is in great form, as compared to Ding. Gukesh needs to score in the first few games. The more equal the series stays the more confidence Ding will gain. Early wins for Gukesh will finish him, like Anand did with Vladimir Kramnik in 2008.""Of course, Ding has bounced back - thrice in his World Championship match against Ian Nepomniachtchi last year. But there is a general assumption that he is no longer the same player, having reached his Elo peak six years ago. And such comebacks are exceptions, not a norm. On the other hand, if Gukesh plays too freely or becomes over-ambitious, he may invite trouble.GM and renowned trainer Swapnil Dhopade said, ""The challenger always has a psychological advantage over the world champ as he has nothing to lose.""But I have noticed an interesting psychological strategy by Ding. He is portraying himself as the underdog thereby releasing pressure and passing it on to Gukesh. But I am sure he wants to keep his WC title desperately.""GM N Srinath, Chennai-mate of Gukesh who captained India to Olympiad gold recently, said, ""Playing against a player of Ding’s class, Gukesh will of course not be able to score wins like he scores in Open events. But on the other hand, he doesn’t need to. He only requires one more win than Ding.""Judit Polgar, arguably the greatest woman to have played chess, told FIDE channel, ""Ding has much better experience and even knowledge. But chess is not about just that. It’s a sport.""Technology is 24x7. The computer has begun to teach us chess now... they are our friends, having different roles in preparation. The chess principles are not so important now, but aspect of time management and concentration is.""When Garry Kasparov lost to Deep Blue in 1997, he alleged that the ‘behaviour’ of the machine was tweaked. If Ding wants some respite, his play must interfere with Gukesh’s decision-making cells. And for that, he must revisit some of his machine-like days. Or, maybe, confuse the Indian with some human moves that had floored Nepo from better position in their last joust.",Ding Liren takes on D Gukesh in World Chess Championship match on Monday. The 18-year-old Indian challenger is not playing exactly computer moves. He is all human but with computer-like precision and a deeper sense of calculation.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115640685,imgsize-52738,width-400,resizemode-4/115640685.jpg"

Ashwin returns home to CSK

Can Chennai Super Kings build their dream team at IPL 2025 auction?

Having retained their top six players for Rs 75 crore, the Mumbai Indians had only a Rs 45 crores purse for the mega auction and swung into the action only late in the day when they snapped up New Zealand’s veteran left-arm pacer Trent Boult , known for his lethal yorkers and early strikes for Rs 12.50cr. It means that Boult, who took 16 wickets in IPL2024 but was still released by the Rajasthan Royals, will wear the MI jersey again and be reunited with India’s ace pacer Jasprit Bumrah at MI.Boult finished with 12 wickets in the Powerplay, the most for a bowler in IPL-2024.The ‘jugalbandi’ of Bumrah and Boult was instrumental in MI’s title-winning campaign in 2020. It was their fifth and last crown.Overall, Boult, 35, has represented as many as five teams Sunrisers Hyderabad before moving to Kolkata Knight Riders, Delhi Capitals, MI, and RR in the cash-rich league.So keen was R Ashwin on the Chennai Super Kings buying him that he even ‘sold himself’ to the franchise in a mock auction on his YouTube Channel. Ultimately, it did turn out to be a case of ‘home sweet home’ for the veteran India off-spinner as he was acquired by CSK for Rs 9.75cr.With RR deciding to invest in youth, Ashwin had a chance at going back to CSK for whom he played from 2010 to 2015.",Trent Boult joins Mumbai Indians for Rs 12.50cr. Boult took 16 wickets in IPL2024 but was still released by Rajasthan Royals.

It was difficult to wait for my debut, says Harshit Rana

What is it about young Indian batting talents and Perth that makes the venue a perfect stage to showcase their wares to the world?The reverberations of an 18-year-old Sachin Tendulkar's 114 in 1992 at the WACA are still felt. Virat Kohli's twin knocks of 44 and 75 at the WACA 20 years later showed everyone what he is made of and on Sunday, Yashasvi Jaiswal stamped his class by smashing a majestic 161 (297 balls, 15x4, 3x6) his fourth hundred, all of them 150-plus, at the Optus Stadium on Day Three of the first Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy to lay claim on the tag of 'The Prince'.Meanwhile Virat Kohli 100* (143b, 8x4, 2x6), 'The King', then pulverized a frazzled Australian attack for his 30th Test century and his first in the last 16 months.The moment the Indian veteran reached triple figures, his second at the Optus after his heroics in 2018 in a losing cause, Indian skipper Jasprit Bumrah declared with the score at 487-6. It left Australia a target of 534 to chase in 25 minutes and two days.The hosts, tired after being in the field for 134.3 overs, ran into an inspired Bumrah again to slump to 12 for 3 in 4.2 hellish overs.Debutant opener Nathan McSweeney could not negotiate the fourth delivery from Bumrah's first over that hit a crack, kept low, darted in at speed and thudded into the pads to fall for a duck.Australians under Steve Waugh rarely opted for a night watchman, but on Sunday, with 20 minutes remaining, Pat Cummins walked in to protect the established batters. But he left soon as he edged a searing outswinger from Mohammed Siraj to Kohli at second slip.At 9 for 2, Australia declared May Day. It soon became 12 for 3 as Marnus Labuschagne left an incoming delivery from Bumrah's final over to be trapped leg before. He even burnt a review.India's dream day had turned into a nightmare for the hosts as openers Jaiswal and KL Rahul continued from where they left on Day Two (172-0) and took the score to 201, India's highest opening stand in Australia.Jaiswal, who resumed Day Three on 90, reached his ton with a ramped six off Hazlewood when on 95 and then spread his arms wide to soak in the applause.Rahul played a few delightful strokes to get to his 50 and move quickly to 77 before edging Starc to wicket-keeper Alex Carey.Devdutt Padikkal batted steadily for 25. All this while he watched Jaiswal launch into an offensive at the other end.India took lunch at 275 for 1, but lost Padikkal immediately after the interval as Australia struck with the new ball with Hazlewood having him caught at second slip by Steve Smith.Kohli exchanged a fist pump with Jaiswal as he walked in at four radiating positivity. With the wicket easing, he chose to bat inside the crease and not indulge in aggressive forward movements that prevented him from negotiating a rising delivery from Hazelwood in the first innings.He also allowed Jaiswal to take control as the young left-hander drilled Cummins authoritatively through widish mid-off to pass 150.A third double looked a certainty, but he slapped an innocuous Mitchell Marsh long-hop to Smith at backward point.India then endured a mini collapse of 8 for 3 when Lyon had Rishabh Pant stumped and Cummins got one to skid low and rap Dhurv Jurel on the pads.But Washington Sundar's sound defence at the other freed up Kohli. Although there was skittish running from the pair, they added 79 crucial runs with Kohli's punch down the ground off Cummins and his slap over point for six off Starc making it to the highlights reel.When Sundar missed a hoick off Lyon and was bowled, Nitish Reddy 38* (27b, 3x4, 2x6) walked in with T20 intent and a message that the team was looking to bowl tonight itself.That got Kohli to unfurl the sweeps and reverse sweeps from his closet. And he got to his hundred with a sweep off Labuschagne who looked to bowl wrist spin outside leg-stump to curb the scoring.Unaware that the ball had reached the fence, Kohli's celebrations were initially muted. After confirming that he had indeed moved from 96 to 100, he took off his helmet to acknowledge the crowd. That done, he then blew a kiss to wife Anushka in the member's stand.","Yashasvi Jaiswal smashes 161 (297 balls, 15x4, 3x6) at the Optus Stadium on Day Three of the first Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy.
