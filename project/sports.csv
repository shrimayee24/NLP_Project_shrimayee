Former NBA player backs Russell Westbrook amid LeBron James ’ scapegoating rumor

Russell Westbrook last played for the Denver Nuggets, but he is currently a free agent. While the Sacramento Kings got themselves hinged with the former NBA MVP, Westbrook is now rumored to have been linked with a new offer overseas. A Chinese team is now eyeing Westbrook for a massive deal, and it’s all over social media. The still-unnamed team is willing to pay the former Nuggets star quadruple what the Sacramento Kings had offered to him. Now that is a huge advancement for Westbrook after the scapegoating rumor that had him blamed for all the wrong reasons during his time with the Los Angeles Lakers. Here’s more information about Russell Westbrook and his big moment with the Chinese team:According to Carmichael Dave of Sactown Sports 1140, an unnamed Chinese team is willing to offer Russell Westbrook a mega deal. The new agreement is willing to offer four times more than what the Sacramento Kings initially offered to Westbrook.“I heard something from someone I trust enough not to blow off what they said. He may have an offer in China for about half a season”, Carmichael Dave said on the podcast. “And it’s damn near quadruple what the Kings could offer him”, he further added. While Westbrook has remained unsigned for a very long time, this has come as a shock to many of his fans and followers.However, previously, the former NBA MVP was linked to the Xinjiang Flying Tigers, as per PlayProphetx. Now, the question is whether Westbrook will sign the deal with the unnamed Chinese team.Even if he does sign for half a season, he could return to the big league by January, and that sounds like a fair deal. Every other player has done it over the course of many years.After the failure of the Los Angeles Lakers in 2021, while Westbrook was still a part of it, the former NBA MVP had to face many criticisms about the same. According to the former ex-NBA player, Enes Kanter, Westbrook became the scapegoat of the team led by Lebron James.“If you play with someone like LeBron, it’s all about LeBron. And if the season fails, then you need some kind of scapegoat”, said Kanter. “After that, look at his career—this guy can’t even find a team right now”, Enes Kanter added further. He also added that huge scapegoating affected Westbrook mentally, and he didn’t deserve this. As Westbrook still has to choose between basketball overseas and the Sacramento Kings, analysts are anticipating a huge deal either way.Also read: Enes Kanter slams LeBron James and Los Angeles Lakers for destroying Russell Westbrook’s career after 2021 disaster",A Chinese team is eyeing Russell Westbrook with a huge deal.

For the September 21, 2025, matchup against the New York Giants, she stunned in a white jacket and trousers paired with red shoes and a KHAITE “Elena” handbag in cream with raspberry-red rose details. Retailing for about $1,900, it was one of her more “casual” accessories, at least by Brittany’s standards.But the real jaw-dropper came months earlier when she carried a Louis Vuitton “Around Me PM” bag to a Chiefs-Ravens game, worth roughly $4,450.

NFL Trade Rumors: Is A.J. Brown’s future in Philadelphia uncertain as NFL GM drops bombshell prediction?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-trade-rumors-is-a-j-browns-future-in-philadelphia-uncertain-as-nfl-gm-drops-bombshell-prediction/articleshow/124485191.cms,"A.J. Brown trade rumors (Imagn Images)

Could the Eagles actually trade A.J. Brown before the deadline?



A.J. Brown’s role and relationship with Jalen Hurts under scrutiny



Six weeks into the NFL season, things don’t look quite right between A.J. Brown and the Philadelphia Eagles. The star wideout, usually the centerpiece of the team’s passing attack, has struggled to find rhythm with quarterback Jalen Hurts. Despite leading the team with 45 targets, Brown has managed only 25 receptions for 274 yards and a single touchdown. Those numbers, for a player of his caliber, are well below expectations — and they’re fueling trade rumors that refuse to go away.The question now is whether Brown could be on the move before the November 4 trade deadline. At least one NFL general manager believes it’s possible. “I think [Eagles general manager] Howie [Roseman] moves him,” an AFC GM told Russini. “It would have to be for the right player or pick, but (a trade) wouldn’t surprise me. Howie likes deals, especially if a player’s value overrides how Brown is being used.”If the Eagles do make that bold move, DeVonta Smith would become the clear top target in the passing game, while contenders like the Kansas City Chiefs, Indianapolis Colts, and Los Angeles Chargers could line up to make offers.Philadelphia insists there’s no intention to trade Brown, but the optics suggest otherwise.Underutilized and seemingly disconnected, Brown’s situation feels increasingly uncertain. As the trade deadline nears, one thing is clear — A.J. Brown’s future in Philadelphia hangs in the balance, and the next few weeks could decide everything.Thursday’s 34-17 loss to the Giants only added more tension. A misfire from Hurts on what could’ve been an easy touchdown to Brown ended in a costly interception, once again highlighting the duo’s ongoing disconnect. While the Eagles’ coaching staff has downplayed the issue, Brown’s visible frustration and cryptic comments tell another story.After the loss, Brown addressed reports of a supposed players-only meeting with Hurts and Saquon Barkley, dismissing the idea entirely. “I don’t recall a meeting,” he said, later clarifying that it was more of a casual conversation than a formal sitdown. NFL insider Dianna Russini echoed his words, saying, “Despite reports of a players-only sitdown… A.J. was, in fact, right. There was never a formal meeting. It was less player summit, more ‘hey, let’s talk for a second. ’”Still, the fallout from that misunderstanding only deepened the perception that something isn’t right in Philadelphia. One NFL source told Russini, “Brown doesn’t look frustrated or mad—he looks indifferent. And that’s not a good place to be.”Also Read: “It’s all sensational drama”: Bill Belichick sets record straight on UNC job drama, says quitting was never even a thought","Philadelphia Eagles wideout A.J.

Abby Summers’ viral TikTok exposes the tedious side of cheerleading glamour

Fans call out the Cowboys organization for outdated treatment of cheerleaders

A spotlight on the unseen realities behind the NFL’s most iconic cheer squad

The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders have long been considered the gold standard of NFL cheer squads — a mix of beauty, athleticism, and precision that defines America’s most famous sidelines. But a recent viral TikTok from cheerleader Abby Summers is challenging that glossy image, revealing the unseen labor that comes with keeping those iconic pom-poms performance-ready.Summers took to TikTok earlier this week, casually announcing, “Tonight starts pom pom fluffing time,” as she began the intricate process of tying and reshaping each strand of her cheer gear. “As I fluff, I’m going to catch up on the rest of my Love Island episode,” she added, showing fans just how hands-on the work really is.In the clip, Summers patiently demonstrated the process, explaining, “You just keep repeating the process of tying in different directions until it gets fluffy.” After a long stretch, she jokingly admitted, “We’re a fourth of the way done,” before calling it a night, a moment that left many viewers stunned by the amount of effort required for something most fans never think twice about.The lighthearted TikTok quickly turned into a heated online discussion.Many viewers criticized the Cowboys organization, arguing that the cheerleaders shouldn’t have to handle such menial tasks on their own — especially given the team’s multi-billion-dollar status.“DCC is literally so embarrassing what do you mean you have to make your own pom-poms and wash your own uniform that you literally don’t even get to keep when you retire?!?!?! It’s a multi-billion dollar organization,” one user wrote. Another fan added, “Imagine if the football players had to blow up the footballs themselves and make their costumes.”Others echoed the sentiment, suggesting that the team should have an equipment staff to handle such tasks. “Why don’t they have an equipment manager team for you all to ensure uniforms are washed and your poms are ready,” one commenter asked.The debate sheds light on a long-running conversation about how professional cheerleaders are treated within major sports organizations, often celebrated for their talent and image but under-supported behind the scenes.Also Read: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders director Kelli Finglass returns to the stage with an empowering message for Mississippi women While Abby Summers’ video may have started as a simple behind-the-scenes moment, it has now sparked a larger cultural discussion about respect, labor, and recognition for the women who bring energy, artistry, and tradition to the NFL’s biggest stages.",Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader Abby Summers' viral TikTok revealed the laborious process of preparing pom-poms.

The unseen struggle behind Gisele Bündchen’s success

Finding peace through balance, wellness , and gratitude

At a time when Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bündchen reigned as the highest-paid supermodel in the world, her life looked picture-perfect. She was the face of Victoria’s Secret, adored globally for her beauty, and earning millions in endorsements. Yet, behind the glamour, Bündchen was silently enduring crippling anxiety and panic attacks that left her feeling trapped and lost.Speaking in a candid interview with British Vogue, Bündchen revealed that her 20s, often considered the peak of her career, were also her darkest years. “From the outside, it looked like I had everything and I was just 22 years old,” she shared. “On the inside, I felt as if I’d hit rock bottom. I was starting my day with a mocha Frappuccino with whipped cream and three cigarettes, then drinking a bottle of wine every night. Imagine what that was doing to my mind.”At the time, she had been modeling since age 14 and was caught in a relentless cycle of travel, photo shoots, and pressure to maintain perfection. After suffering from severe anxiety for over a year, Bündchen knew she had to make a drastic change. Seeking guidance from a naturopath, she was advised to eliminate alcohol, caffeine, dairy, and cigarettes, a lifestyle overhaul that initially felt unbearable.“I remember him saying, ‘Well, do you want to live?’” she recalled. That moment became the turning point that set her on a journey toward healing.Within three months, Bündchen’s panic attacks disappeared. She began meditating at 5 a.m., embracing clean eating, and prioritizing her mental and physical health. “I think I feel better in my forties than I did in my twenties,” she said. “We’re all told that life is over at 40, and I feel like I’m just beginning.”Now, as a mother and wellness advocate, Bündchen champions a holistic approach to life, balancing family, mindfulness, and purpose. Reflecting on her marriage to NFL legend Tom Brady, she acknowledged, “It takes work to really be in sync with someone, especially after you have kids. [Tom’s] focus is on his career, mine is mostly on the kids. And I’m very grateful that he lets me take the reins when it comes to our family. He trusts my decisions.”Also Read: “Spiraling into sleepless nights”: Taylor Swift reportedly has her exes losing sleep over one eyebrow-raising song inspired by Travis Kelce For Gisele Bündchen, the journey from fame to fulfillment was not about perfection, it was about rediscovering herself beyond the spotlight and choosing peace over pressure.","Supermodel Gisele Bündchen shared her struggles with crippling anxiety and panic attacks during her 20s.

This potential reunion hints at Swift rebalancing her life amidst her relationship with Travis Kelce and her global tour.

Friendship whispers resurface after Blake Lively’s lawsuit drama

How Travis Kelce fits into Taylor Swift’s redefined circle



As Taylor Swift continues her global domination with The Life of a Showgirl, fans are now shifting their attention from her chart-topping music to her rekindled friendships and perhaps even her relationship balance with NFL star Travis Kelce . The latest whisper comes from Deuxmoi, where insiders claim Swift and her longtime friend Blake Lively may have quietly reunited after months of rumored distance.According to Deuxmoi’s October 9th Deux/U podcast, a discreet source revealed that Swift and Lively “may have allegedly seen each other in the last few weeks.” The insider described the encounter as “not strained, rather friends just being friends.” The rumor comes months after Lively’s public “It Ends With Us” lawsuit against actor Justin Baldoni, which narrowly brushed against Swift’s name.While details remain private, the speculation has sparked excitement among fans who feared the pair’s friendship had fizzled. Observant Swifties also pointed out that Swift was recently spotted wearing a Lorraine Schwartz bracelet—the same one Lively wore to the It Ends With Us London premiere in 2024. Was it a subtle nod of support, or just another of Swift’s famous Easter eggs?Adding another layer, Swift’s track “CANCELLED!” from her new album has stirred conversation for its apparent empathy toward a friend facing public backlash. Many believe the song was inspired by Lively’s experience, a move that would mark Swift’s quiet show of loyalty rather than shade.As Swift navigates her increasingly public relationship with Travis Kelce, some fans wonder whether her time in Kansas City and her global tour life have naturally distanced her from Hollywood friends. Yet, if reports of a Lively-Swift reunion are true, it could signal that the pop star is rebalancing her worlds, one where the NFL and Hollywood coexist peacefully.Also Read: “Shape of a….”: Taylor Swift’s ‘Wood’ sparks chaos as fans uncover steamy new hidden tour detail and Travis Kelce reacts Swift, who is the godmother to Lively and Ryan Reynolds’ children, seems unlikely to let that bond fade completely.

Assessing the Winners

My Final Thoughts on this Mock Trade

Theare reportedly exploring a potential trade with the Washington Wizards centered around sharpshooter, with young forward Jonathan Kuminga expected to headline the package heading to D.C. The rumored deal has generated considerable buzz around the NBA, as Golden State looks to strengthen its championship hopes, improve roster balance, and create more financial flexibility during the final stages of Stephen Curry’s title window.According to multiple reports, the proposed trade structure would see the Golden State Warriors send Jonathan Kuminga to the Wizards in exchange for Corey Kispert and a future 2030 first-round draft pick - a selection that originally belonged to Golden State.• Golden State Warriors receive: Corey Kispert, 2030 first-round pick (originally theirs)• Washington Wizards receive: Jonathan KumingaThis swap would immediately benefit Golden State financially, as Kispert’s projected $13.9 million contract is roughly $8.6 million less than Kuminga’s $22.5 million deal, easing the team’s growing luxury tax concerns.For the Golden State Warriors, acquiring Corey Kispert would address several needs simultaneously. The 26-year-old wing is a proven 3-and-D specialist who thrives in motion offenses, making him a seamless fit next to Curry, Jimmy Butler , and Draymond Green. His career 38.2% shooting from beyond the arc adds another reliable perimeter threat to a team that thrives on spacing and quick ball movement.Another key benefit is the reacquisition of their 2030 first-round pick, which increases the team’s flexibility for future trades. Moreover, the move reduces overall salary obligations, aligning with the front office’s strategy to trim costs while keeping the roster competitive.For Washington, this trade represents a classic rebuilding move. By landing 22-year-old Jonathan Kuminga , the Wizards secure a high-upside player with star potential. Kuminga’s athleticism, defensive versatility, and ability to create off the dribble make him an exciting addition to their young core. The Wizards can offer him a larger offensive role, providing the developmental environment he needs to unlock his full potential and become a franchise cornerstone.• Immediate upgrade in floor spacing and perimeter shooting.• A better positional fit in Steve Kerr’s offensive system.• Relief from financial pressure with reduced salary commitments.• Regained control of a valuable future draft asset.• Losing a young player with genuine star potential.• Corey Kispert’s defensive limitations and lack of elite athleticism could cap his ceiling.• Reduced long-term upside, as Kuminga’s best years may still be ahead.• Acquire a former lottery pick with elite athleticism and untapped potential.• Kuminga can grow into a featured role on a team focused on development.• Ideal move for a rebuilding franchise seeking future stars.• Loss of a key floor-spacer in Kispert, potentially affecting offensive balance.• Uncertainty over whether Kuminga can develop into a consistent, franchise-level player in a losing environment.Corey Kispert’s strength lies in his efficiency as a spot-up shooter and off-ball mover. Standing at 6-foot-7, he has improved his ability to find space within offensive schemes but remains limited as a creator and defender. Kuminga, on the other hand, offers elite athleticism, defensive versatility, and a far higher developmental ceiling, though he remains inconsistent and unproven as a lead scorer.• Golden State Warriors: This is a “win-now” move that prioritizes fit, shooting, and financial relief. The front office’s focus is clearly on maximizing Curry’s championship window, even if it means parting with a potential future star.• Washington Wizards: The Wizards get the long-term win by adding a potential franchise player in Kuminga, aligning perfectly with their rebuilding vision.• Jonathan Kuminga: Gains a larger role and more on-ball opportunities in Washington, but must prove he can thrive without veteran guidance in a rebuilding setup.• Corey Kispert: Lands in an ideal environment in Golden State, where his shooting and movement can shine alongside elite playmakers.The proposed trade between Golden State and Washington encapsulates the contrasting priorities of both franchises - one aiming to capitalize on its championship core, the other looking to secure its future. For the Golden State Warriors, it’s a calculated gamble that enhances shooting, chemistry, and flexibility. For the Wizards, it’s an investment in potential that could pay off massively if Kuminga fulfills his promise.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Utah Jazz Could Part Ways With $238 Million Superstar Ahead of 2025-26 Season; Exploring Possible Better Teams Ultimately, the deal will be judged by what Kuminga becomes. If he develops into an All-Star, Washington walks away with a clear victory. But if Corey Kispert helps the Golden State Warriors capture another title, Golden State’s decision to prioritize the present will look like a masterstroke.","The Golden State Warriors are reportedly exploring a potential trade with the Washington Wizards centered around sharpshooter Jonathan Kuminga.

My Two Cents: Who Wins the Trade?

Theare reportedly weighing a blockbuster trade proposal that could drastically reshape their roster ahead of the 2025-26 NBA season. With LeBron James ’ health being carefully managed and uncertainty surrounding his availability for the season opener, the Lakers appear open to bold moves to stay competitive.As the regular season approaches, LeBron James ’ readiness remains in question. According to his agent, Rich Paul, the Los Angeles Lakers have been advised to take a cautious route to ensure the veteran star is fully healthy for what could be one of the final runs of his storied career.“LeBron wants to compete for a championship,” Paul told ESPN. “He knows the Lakers are building for the future. He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all. We are very appreciative of the partnership that we’ve had for eight years with Jeanie [Buss] and Rob [Pelinka] and consider the Lakers as a critical part of his career.” (H/t: Sporting News)James, now entering his 22nd season, is prioritizing longevity and success over rushing back to the court. The Los Angeles Lakers, in turn, are reportedly exploring options to add more star power to their lineup and support their aging superstar.Reports suggest the Los Angeles Lakers are keeping a close watch on the Utah Jazz, particularly regarding two of their players - Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen. While Kessler’s availability remains uncertain, there are whispers that Utah might entertain offers for Markkanen if the right package is presented.“It’s unclear if Utah will be reasonable in its trade demands for Kessler, but the door appears at least slightly ajar for the Lakers to bring that value back to Los Angeles given the failed extension,” wrote Lake Show Life’s Max Ogden.Bleacher Report’s Andy Bailey proposed a hypothetical trade that has since gained traction among fans and analysts. The deal would send a significant haul from Los Angeles to Utah in exchange for All-Star forward Lauri Markkanen - who is currently on a $195 million deal.The deal is designed to give the Los Angeles Lakers another elite scorer who can stretch the floor alongside Anthony Davis, potentially forming a dangerous frontcourt duo.While landing Markkanen would instantly improve the Lakers’ offensive potential, the price tag is enormous. Losing young contributors like Reaves and Hachimura would strip Los Angeles of much of its depth and chemistry, while Knecht’s departure would mean sacrificing a promising long-term asset.For Utah, the return is far more appealing. The Jazz would receive multiple first-round picks, a mix of established talent, and Knecht - who could emerge as a cornerstone for their rebuild.• Gain a proven All-Star scorer• Improve frontcourt shooting and spacing• Risk depleting bench depth and future draft assets• Acquire young and versatile contributors• Stockpile valuable draft capital• Strengthen long-term rebuild potentialThe proposed trade certainly stirs excitement, but its benefits lean more toward Utah. The Jazz would gain both present and future assets, while the Lakers would risk sacrificing depth and flexibility for a single All-Star addition.As noted by Hunter Cookston, who reported the story, “The proposed trade would certainly shake up the NBA - but for the Lakers, it’s questionable at best. In this scenario, the clear winner would be the Jazz.”Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Potentially Eyeing $54 Million Washington Wizards Forward to Bolster Squad Around Stephen Curry With LeBron James nearing the twilight of his career and Anthony Davis in his prime, the Los Angeles Lakers face a challenging balance between contending now and safeguarding their future.

“missed test,”

Alica Schmidt shares her late-night anti-doping call

“Doping control called me last night while I was at the movies. I had to leave 30 minutes into the film, but luckily I saw the call!”

Alica Schmidt’s tough 2025 and move to 800 meters

German runner Alica Schmidt, known as the “world’s sexiest Olympic athlete,” says she was pulled out of a movie theatre late at night for a surprise anti-doping test. The 26-year-old was watching a film when she suddenly got a call from doping control. It was nearly 11 p.m. when the officials reached out. She left the theatre midway, thankful she checked her phone, because missing the call could have counted as asomething that can hurt an athlete’s career.Alica Schmidt, who ran in Germany’s 4x400m relay team at the 2024 Paris Olympics, posted the strange moment on her Instagram Story on Wednesday. She wrote,She said testers always call anonymously, which means she couldn’t call them back. According to World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) rules, three missed tests or filing failures in twelve months can lead to a violation. That’s why answering every test call is so important.Many athletes, including tennis star Naomi Osaka, have also shared their difficult experiences with surprise tests. Osaka once said she was woken up at 5 a.m. in her hotel room for blood testing.

The Man Who took the life of TikToker Yoon Ji-ah — The Dark Truth Behind “Black Cat”

The digital world in South Korea is mourning after losing Yoon Ji-ah who was known for being a TikToker and live streamer with more than 300,000 fans. On September 11, she was found dead on a secluded mountain in Muju County, North Jeolla Province, only a few hours after her last live stream. The terrifying circumstances of her passing have once again raised the issues of the dark side of fan communities and influencer security in the era of the internet.Police have indicated that Yoon Ji-ah met with her death about 30 minutes after cutting off her last stream. The 30-year-old digital star was pronounced dead with serious physical injuries inflicted on her body through beating, strangling, and asphyxias. Later, the medical examiner declared the cause of death to be suffocation from neck compression.Initially, the fan's affection reportedly transformed into obsession. Choi, who presented himself as a CEO enjoying success, was actually an individual who had gotten into deep financial trouble and lost his home through auction. He had created a fake persona and was financially supported which led him to create a close bond with Yoon and even convince her to go into business together.But there were reports about Yoon having recently sought to break the ties claiming controlling behavior and demanding schedule as reasons. The CCTV clips released by the detectives showed Choi kneeling and asking for forgiveness just before the tragic event. As per his later confession, he dragged her into her car before killing.After the murder, Choi made an effort to hide his actions, dressing up with a suitcase, and taking several stops to misdirect the police before he left Yoon's body on the mountainside. He was captured 12 hours after the incident. He first proclaimed his innocence but later admitted it when the police found the corpse.The death of Yoon Ji-ah has created a wave of nationwide protests and mourning compared to which the calls for more effective safety measures for content creators against the obsessive online behavior are stronger than ever. Her death serves as a grim reminder of the dangers influencers face, prompting urgent calls for stronger digital safety laws, mental health awareness, and accountability within online communities to prevent similar tragedies. Yoon Ji-ah’s story stands as a haunting reminder of love turned obsession, fame turned fear, and the urgent need to protect those who bring light to the digital world.","Yoon Ji-ah was found dead on a mountain in North Jeolla Province, South Korea.

Bill Belichick focused on rebuilding UNC amid early season struggles



Off-field controversies and docuseries setback add to Belichick’s challenges



Bill Belichick, one of football’s most storied coaches, is facing early turbulence in his first college season with the University of North Carolina. Despite a rough 2-3 start and swirling reports suggesting UNC had explored a buyout, sources close to the 73-year-old coach insist he was “never looking into buyouts for UNC. ” Belichick, they claim, was as blindsided as anyone when the speculation surfaced earlier this week.According to PEOPLE, the legendary former Patriots coach Bill Belichick was “surprised” to learn about the rumors that UNC officials were discussing his exit just five games into the season. “It’s all sensational drama,” the source added, emphasizing Belichick’s continued commitment to turning the program around.Belichick, who famously referred to North Carolina as “the 33rd NFL franchise” during offseason recruiting, has struggled to replicate his pro-level success on the college field. The Tar Heels’ disappointing performances—including heavy losses to TCU, UCF, and Clemson—have only intensified scrutiny. Still, both Belichick and UNC have dismissed any notion of a split, releasing a joint statement reaffirming that they remain “fully committed” to their partnership.Behind the scenes, however, tensions have reportedly brewed. A WRAL-TV report described the program as “an unstructured mess,” with claims of poor communication between coaches and players. In the wake of these allegations, assistant coach Armond Hawkins was suspended for violating NCAA rules by providing unauthorized sideline passes.Away from the gridiron, Belichick’s off-field life has been equally scrutinized. His relationship with 24-year-old Jordon Hudson, a former cheerleader who recently began acting as his publicist, has drawn public attention—and concern from some of his former players and friends. Their partnership gained further visibility after a CBS interview featuring the couple went viral, adding to the ongoing media frenzy surrounding the coach.To make matters more complicated, a former North Carolina official has filed a lawsuit alleging that Belichick was illegally hired by the university. Meanwhile, a Hulu-backed docuseries chronicling his first season at UNC has reportedly been put on hold, with insiders suggesting the streaming giant’s creative direction “wasn’t in alignment” with the university’s vision.Despite the chaos, Belichick remains steadfast. His focus, sources say, is still on leading UNC football forward—a challenge perhaps tougher than any he faced in his 24 years with the New England Patriots.Also Read: Bo Nix’s wife Izzy steals spotlight with touching four-word pregnancy reveal before Broncos face the Jets","Bill Belichick is facing early turbulence in his first college season with the University of North Carolina.

Mavericks vs Hornets: Final Prediction

Predicted Score:

Dallas Mavericks 115 – Charlotte Hornets 103

Thepreseason matchup promises to be an intriguing NBA contest, as both teams aim to bounce back from disappointing previous seasons. Scheduled to take place at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, this early exhibition provides valuable clues about roster chemistry and performance trends before the 2025-26 regular season officially begins. The Mavericks enter this contest as clear favorites. Current moneyline odds sit at Dallas -260 compared to Charlotte +180, reflecting strong confidence in the home side. The spread is set at Mavericks -6.5, while the total points line of 226.5 hints at a moderately high-scoring affair. Fans can tune in live through NBA League Pass, FuboTV, or KFAA broadcast.Based on preseason performance and depth, Dallas is well-positioned to secure a win and cover the spread, especially given Charlotte’s early struggles.The Mavericks have displayed encouraging preseason form. Their 106-89 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder highlighted solid defensive execution and improved teamwork. Following a major roster overhaul - headlined by the departure of Luka Doncic to the LA Lakers mid-last season - Dallas has retooled effectively with additions like D’Angelo Russell, Dennis Smith Jr., and rookie sensation Cooper Flagg.Currently holding a 5-5 combined record across preseason and summer league, Dallas has shown flashes of brilliance alongside moments of inconsistency.Anthony Davis and Klay Thompson have seen limited minutes so far but are expected to ramp up involvement as the season nears.Meanwhile, the Charlotte Hornets are off to a rocky start, losing both their opening preseason matchups against the Thunder. Despite significant offseason moves bringing in Pat Connaughton, Spencer Dinwiddie, Mason Plumlee, and Collin Sexton, the team is still seeking balance under second-year coach Charles Lee. LaMelo Ball continues to be the central playmaker and leader, though the squad’s lack of cohesion on both ends of the floor remains apparent.Statistically, Dallas holds a significant advantage over Charlotte in past meetings.Historically, Dallas’ fast-paced offense and disciplined ball handling have been decisive in overcoming Charlotte. The Hornets ’ recent revamp has introduced experience and scoring depth, but their defense still appears porous and disorganized.With several stars playing limited minutes, bettors should look toward rising contributors and efficient scorers.Given the odds and trends, Dallas -6.5 against the spread appears to be the most favorable bet. The Mavericks’ home advantage, deeper rotation, and improved shooting should give them a decisive edge over a Hornets team still finding its rhythm.Fans can expect a high-energy contest featuring a blend of star power and youthful promise. Cooper Flagg, the Mavericks’ prized rookie, will draw significant attention as he continues to adapt to NBA competition. Dallas’ coaching staff is also expected to give extended run to bench players to test rotation depth.For Charlotte, this game serves as a chance to experiment with new lineups and establish on-court chemistry. LaMelo Ball’s playmaking and Collin Sexton’s aggressiveness will be key in determining how competitive the Hornets can remain throughout the matchup.While both sides will manage star minutes carefully, the overall intensity should rise as the regular season approaches.Given Dallas’ preseason form, superior depth, and historical dominance, the Mavericks are projected to defeat the Hornets in this preseason encounter. Expect a high-tempo, offensively driven game where the Mavericks’ bench strength and home support make the difference.Also read: Dallas Mavericks vs Charlotte Hornets Preseason Game Injury Report: Who's In, Who's Out, and More Dallas’ revamped roster looks ready to make noise in the 2025-26 season, while Charlotte continues to navigate its rebuilding process under Charles Lee.

Shocking footage shows Mark Sanchez disoriented before confrontation

Legal charges mount as investigation deepens

Former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez is once again making headlines but this time, not for anything on the field. A disturbing video released by TMZ has surfaced showing the ex-New York Jets player stumbling through downtown Indianapolis shortly before a violent confrontation that resulted in his arrest. The footage paints a chaotic picture of a man seemingly spiraling, adding complexity to a case that has shocked both fans and law enforcement.According to reports, Sanchez was caught on surveillance video wandering aimlessly for nearly 20 minutes before the altercation took place near the Westin Hotel. Witnesses described him as “stumbling” and “visibly disoriented.” Moments later, he allegedly followed a 69-year-old delivery driver and aggressively confronted him.Police affidavits reveal the situation escalated quickly. The delivery driver reportedly tried to back away as Sanchez “chased and grabbed” him, forcefully throwing the older man against a wall before taking the scuffle into an alleyway. When the driver feared for his safety, he used pepper spray, but Sanchez appeared unfazed and lunged again, prompting the victim to pull a knife and stab Sanchez “two or three times” in self-defense.Sanchez has been charged with felony battery causing serious bodily injury, along with several misdemeanors connected to the incident. The delivery driver’s use of the knife is also under review, as prosecutors determine whether it constituted lawful self-defense.Following the stabbing, footage published by the New York Post showed Sanchez stumbling down the street, bleeding and visibly in distress. Authorities are now reportedly awaiting his toxicology results, as prosecutors probe whether substance use may have played a role in the erratic behavior.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders’ mom Pilar sends sweet gesture to ex-husband Deion amid his health struggles The once-promising quarterback, once celebrated for leading the Jets to back-to-back AFC Championship appearances, now finds himself at the center of a disturbing legal battle.

Can’t wait to tear through enemies as Logan? Same. After the teaser dropped for Marvel’s Wolverine, set to release in 2026, fans went crazy all over social media. But until Marvel’s Wolverine finally lands, there are some epic superhero games that’ll scratch that power fantasy itch. Here are 5 of the best games you should definitely play before Logan comes out slashing everything.Sometimes you need a break from all the stabbing. This game is less about perfect combos and more about the journey. It’s the superhero equivalent of a really good, really funny movie you can actually play inside of. A total vibe shift. And even if you’re not a fan of Guardians of the Galaxy, play this game. The story is unexpectedly deep and the jokes are actually funny. You just vibe with the crew on your ship. It's less about being angry and more about, like, feelings and cool 80s music. A total change of pace that somehow just works.The movie was a whole mess, we all agree. But the game? The game is pure, beautiful chaos. It’s just you, your claws, and guys getting turned into confetti. Raven Software made it insanely fun. The combat is wild, the finishers brutal, and Logan’s healing animations still hit hard today.The best part is you can literally get blown up into a skeleton and just… heal. It's so extra and we respect it so much.If there’s one game that completely changed superhero games, it was Batman: Arkham Asylum. This game is really good. It was the first to make people go crazy about superhero games. In this game, Batman felt very responsive, cool, and chaotic. The combat is intense, the atmosphere is dark (just how you would expect to be), and Batman is very smart. You can flow from one guy to another without even thinking.It wouldn’t do justice if we didn’t mention Batman: Arkham Knight. Launched in 205, this game is still reviewed in 2025. You get to maintain law and order in Gotham city and can do practically anything you want with the criminals. Gotham is a sight to behold at night, especially in the rain, and the combat is still smoother than anything. You just feel like a total predator. Definitely a must-play before Wolverine comes out.Spider-Man 2 is one of the best superhero games of all time. Insomniac refined the game so much after the 1st Spiderman game. This game is basically a preview of what Insomniac's gonna do with our favorite angry Canadian. The web-swinging is pure serotonin, the combat is perfect, and the Venom moments? Unhinged. It's the best way to see the studio's current-gen magic firsthand.Marvel’s Wolverine is shaping up to be Insomniac’s darkest and most brutal game yet, but while you wait, these five superhero titles offer plenty of action, story, and chaos to keep you hyped. So gear up, grab your controller, and unleash your inner hero (or anti-hero).",Marvel’s Wolverine is set to release in 2026. Here are five games you should definitely play before Logan comes out.

Jared Bednar breaks silence on facing former Avalanche star Mikko Rantanen in Avalanche vs. Stars clash



Mikko Rantanen finds new momentum while Colorado Avalanche move on



From January to March, Mikko Rantanen went through one of the most turbulent stretches of his NHL career. The 28-year-old forward, who had spent a decade with the Colorado Avalanche, was first traded to the Carolina Hurricanes before landing with the Dallas Stars after contract disputes. Now, as Colorado prepares to face Dallas, Rantanen’s former coach Jared Bednar is making headlines for his brutally honest remarks ahead of the highly anticipated clash.The Colorado Avalanche are gearing up to face the Dallas Stars for their third game of the 2025-26 NHL season, setting the stage for an emotional reunion between Rantanen and his former coach. Once the centerpiece of Colorado’s offense, Rantanen left a lasting legacy in Denver with his exceptional goal-scoring ability and leadership on the ice. But Jared Bednar seems to have moved on.When asked how long it took to overcome Rantanen’s departure, Bednar didn’t hesitate. “Once you play him in a playoff series, for me, it’s like you’re business focused and that’s it,” Bednar said. “He’s gone, he’s gone. For me, it took me about ten minutes. Not that I don’t like Mikko, but I’m not dwelling in the past on any of that kind of stuff. You have to move forward and move forward quickly.”His comments stem from last season’s bitter playoff loss, where Rantanen scored a stunning hat trick in Game 7 to knock the Avalanche out of the first round. The performance not only sealed Colorado’s elimination but also marked a new chapter in Rantanen’s career — one that turned admiration into rivalry.Since joining the Dallas Stars, Mikko Rantanen has made an immediate impact, boosting an already high-powered offense with his lethal scoring instincts. The Finnish forward continues to prove why he remains one of the NHL’s most feared wingers.Jared Bednar’s Avalanche have started the 2025-26 season with a perfect 2-0-0 record, demonstrating depth, resilience, and a renewed identity without their former star. The team appears ready to reassert itself in the Western Conference.Saturday’s clash is more than a regular-season game; with Rantanen facing his former team and Colorado showcasing a reloaded roster under Bednar, the matchup promises high intensity, emotion, and a clear indication of how both sides have moved forward since the trade. With Rantanen thriving in Dallas and Colorado hungry for redemption, this showdown could redefine early-season power dynamics in the NHL.Also Read: Inside the bond of Oilers stars Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl: How they celebrate and back each other’s success",Mikko Rantanen to face former coach Jared Bednar in Colorado Avalanche vs. Dallas Stars clash.

Rohit Sharma removed as India ODI captain, a glorious era comes to an end

Poll Do you agree with Mohammad Kaif that Rohit Sharma will play a key role in the 2027 ODI World Cup despite losing captaincy? Yes, I completely agree No, I disagree

NEW DELHi: Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif has made a bold statement about Rohit Sharma ’s future, asserting that the Mumbai batter will feature prominently in the 2027 ODI World Cup despite being relieved of his captaincy. Shubman Gill was recently appointed India’s new ODI captain ahead of the three-match series against Australia starting October 19, but Kaif believes Rohit’s leadership status will not affect his role as a key opener for India.“He will definitely play, boss. Look, the captaincy may have been taken away from him, but I believe that as an opener, Rohit Sharma will do his job,” Kaif said on his YouTube channel.The former cricketer highlighted the importance of experience in challenging conditions, particularly in South Africa, where the World Cup will be co-hosted alongside Zimbabwe and Namibia. “You need an experienced batter in the side. You can’t go to South Africa with an entirely young team. Sometimes in those seaming conditions, the ball moves a lot and the pitches are bouncy. If you take only new players there, they’ll get exposed.Kaif praised Rohit’s ability to handle pace and bounce, saying, “That’s why I feel you need a player who can handle the bounce, who can pull and cut the rising deliveries just like Rohit Sharma does. On those kinds of pitches, I believe Rohit Sharma will perform even better. His batting style as an opener suits such conditions perfectly. He plays the rising ball, the one that bounces from the front, extremely well. Among all the players you can name, Rohit Sharma is the only one who handles that rising delivery so effectively. ”He also emphasised the importance of combining youth with experience in crucial tournaments.“Just look at his numbers, his years of experience. On a big stage like the World Cup, you need players like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, players who have seen the world and experienced ups and downs. In a tournament like the World Cup, you’re going to lose a game or two in between, then you’ll need to make a comeback. You’ll face those do-or-die matches where you must win to reach the quarterfinals or top four. In such crucial situations, the roles of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli become absolutely vital.”",Mohammad Kaif believes Rohit Sharma will play a key role in the 2027 ODI World Cup despite being relieved of his captaincy.

IND vs WI 1st Test: Why West Indies' decision to bat first vs India backfired?

Poll Do you think Yashasvi Jaiswal can surpass Sachin Tendulkar's Test century record? Yes, he has the talent. No, Tendulkar's record is monumental.

NEW DELHI: Test cricket can be hard, brutal business if you lack penetration as a bowling unit. Coming into this game, the West Indies had the third worst win-loss ratio in Tests since 2020, having lost 23 of 41 matches, making them marginally better than Bangladesh and bottom-placed Ireland. That lack of aptitude and imagination showed at the Ferozeshah Kotla on Friday, in spite of periods of disciplined bowling, as the once-mighty Windies bowling unit seemed cannon fodder for a strong Indian top order on a dry, batting-friendly surface.For those who missed out in Ahmedabad, it was time to rack up the numbers — Yashasvi Jaiswal reminded the world of his penchant for daddy hundreds, becoming only the second Test opener after Graeme Smith to score seven Test tons before turning 24. Among Indians, he is now second only to the peerless Sachin Tendulkar , who had scored 11. Five of his hundreds are scores of 150 or more. Giving Jaiswal company for most of the day was the under-pressure Sai Sudharsan, who fell 13 runs short of the three-figure mark but played an important role in a 193-run second-wicket stand, the fourth-highest partnership ever by a lefthanded Indian pair in Tests.Jaiswal ended the day batting on 173 off 253 balls (22x4) and passed 3,000 runs across formats. India took stumps on Day One of the second Test at 318/2 after Shubman Gill won the first toss of his short captaincy career.It was all worthy pursuit for India — they are chasing the full WTC points at home and some have reputations at stake, so there were no half-hearted measures. For the West Indies, it was ceaseless toil, with only left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican coming away with some special moments, notably the dismissals of KL Rahul and Sudharsan, with some alarming turn offering a portent of what might be to come in this Test.West Indies had seemed despondent in the days leading up to the Test and must have been world weary by the end of Day One. None of that matters, of course, to Jaiswal, who played largely within himself, mindful of the need to take the game away from the opposition on the first day itself.Jaiswal scored only 10 off his first 36 deliveries, trying to increase the control percentage of the cut shots which have been both his boon and bane, as the West Indies seamers started off with controlled lengths and disciplined lines. A yard or two of extra pace would have gone a long way, though.Even before an hour was through, Jaiswal was heard on the stump mic telling his opening partner how nothing much was happening off the pitch, a typical Kotla phenomenon, and with little seam movement on offer, it was a matter of time before the bowlers’ lengths disintegrated and India’s batting found some fluency.There will be a lot of spin to be bowled yet, but the first wicket that fell to spinners in this game was a wonderful one — an unusually aggressive Rahul was left mystified, first beaten in the air and then off the pitch by one from Warrican which turned 84 degrees, having landed either on the seam or on a crack.The dismissal only strengthened the hungry Jaiswal’s resolve to leave his imprint on the game. He decided to adapt minimalism instead of expansive, ambitious strokeplay or bold footwork, playing crisp, clean cover drives, straight drives, threading open spaces behind square when available and rotating strike efficiently. By the second session, his trademark run-scoring square of the wicket was in full view as Jayden Seales started offering width.With no innovation or attempt to disrupt proceedings by Windies captain Roston Chase, all Jaiswal needed to do was exhibit restraint and then cash in on loose offerings. The Windies bowled no extras but Jaiswal reacted by not attempting any sixes throughout the day.Sure, the seamers could have bowled fuller, especially in the middle session, while the spinners could have made more effort to change the angles. The captain could have messed up the fields a bit more to plant doubts in the batters’ minds, but maybe Chase knew the Indian batters would just raise their game.Such is most of Test cricket these days, strangely lop-sided affairs which have largely alienated the cricket-loving masses. Not counting, of course, contests between the chosen top three or four teams, most of which have had robust first-class structures with strong financial backing in place for close to a century or more. For the others, there is perhaps little incentive remaining now to invest in building such infrastructure for the red-ball game.India’s expected dominance on Day One may further deflate the Windies, meaning there might be more to come from Jaiswal. Sudharsan, meanwhile, showed he deserved a longer rope at No. 3.","Yashasvi Jaiswal becomes only the second Test opener after Graeme Smith to score seven Test tons before turning 24.

Eagles fans demand OC Kevin Patullo to be fired after a disappointing 34-17 loss to the Giants



Also Read:

In Week 6 of the 2025 NFL season, the Philadelphia Eagles lost to the New York Giants by a disappointing score of 34-17. Some fans blame Eagles offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo—they want him fired. Amid growing online outrage over the Eagles' loss to the Giants, Eagles star quarterback Jalen Hurts’ views on Patullo resurfaced. Back in February, before the season began, Hurts shared, “His job is gonna demand something totally different of him.”Kevin Patullo, 44, has been with the Philadelphia Eagles since 2021. For two seasons, he served as their passing game coordinator. Then, in 2023 and 2024, he took on the role of passing game coordinator and associate head coach. It was only in 2025, after Kellen Moore left to become the New Orleans Saints head coach, that Patullo transitioned to (was promoted to) offensive coordinator, taking over for Moore’s previously dominant offense. Now, what is the difference between his two roles?On February 20, ESPN Eagles/NFL Reporter Tim McManus shared on X, Hurts said,“Kevin Patullo has never been…I mean, he’d have a different role. So, it’s hard to compare that role (as passing game coordinator) to this role (offensive coordinator) because his job is gonna demand something totally different of him.I have a lot of confidence in him and what he’s shown. However, I know over the years I’ve learned that it is out of my jurisdiction. So, kind of just taking things as they come. Try to go out there and be the best I can be and just learn.”These comments were made several months before the Eagles’ recent loss to the Giants and the ensuing backlash. But an X account named O.J. Spivey reshared it on October 10.Returning to the present—Eagles fans are fuming with fury over Kevin Patullo’s performance as offensive coordinator. Let’s check out their reactions.One brutally honest fan wrote, “If the Eagles don’t fire Kevin Patullo this week then you can probably write the rest of this season off.”Eagles Fan Central boldly posted this on X: “The defense can at least say they’re down Quinyon, Carter, and Nolan Smith. The offense? Once again scoreless for an entire half. Against the Giants. Orlovsky calling out their predictability. I doubt they do it, but Kevin Patullo is way in over his head and should be dismissed tomorrow. Get a grown-up play caller and stop wasting Saquon, AJ, and DeVonta’s primes.”The Eagle Times asked a straightforward question on X: “YES OR NO: Kevin Patullo needs to be fired.” Fans vehemently reacted to it with one saying yes in different languages: “Yes Si Oui Da Hai Ja.”Another wrote, “Couldn't get Barkley a TD. I have no idea what he's doing.”A third fan shared, “Well he needs to change the way he’s coaching because we are going down real fast.”A fourth fan commented, “I’m starting to think something needs to happen. This offence of all stars look lost.”A fifth fan said, “Yes. Absolutely. The Eagles also need to go out and acquire five or six new defensive players immediately.”","Kevin Patullo, 44, has been with the Philadelphia Eagles since 2021.

While the result wasn’t in their favor, the game offered valuable insights into the team’s strengths, young talent, and areas needing improvement. For a squad aiming for playoff contention, these early-season tests are crucial for growth and chemistry.Facing a seasoned opponent like the Avalanche is always challenging. Colorado’s goaltender, Scott Wedgewood, proved nearly impenetrable, turning away multiple scoring opportunities, including a critical save on a late game-tying chance. Head coach André Tourigny acknowledged the challenge, saying, “We had good chances, but Wedgie, the other side, did a good job.” Despite the loss, Utah consistently pressured Wedgewood and created breakaway opportunities, showing flashes of a capable and determined offense.The Mammoth’s young second line—Dylan Guenther, Logan Cooley, and JJ Peterka—showed potential but will require time to build cohesion. Guenther, known for his offensive firepower, also impressed on the penalty kill, intercepting passes and creating a shorthanded scoring attempt.His versatility suggests he could become a key impact player this season.Newcomers made their presence felt as well. JJ Peterka brought speed and dynamic playmaking, demonstrating the ability to generate offense independently. Dmitriy Simashev exceeded expectations in his NHL debut, stepping up after Olli Määttä’s early injury and handling the pressure with poise. “I was nervous, but it went about how I expected,” Simashev said. “I’ll remember this all my life. It was my first game in the NHL. It was unbelievable.” Brandon Tanev, Nate Schmidt, and Andrew Agozzino also integrated well, providing depth and stability.While Utah’s offense must refine shooting lanes and coordination, the game highlighted that the team can challenge elite competition. With additional experience, the Mammoth’s offensive units, combined with their talented young stars, are likely to become more dangerous and effective.Next up, Utah faces the Nashville Predators, offering another chance to strengthen chemistry and build confidence. If the Mammoth continue to learn from these early tests and harness the potential of their rookies and new signings, they could emerge as a genuine playoff contender in the NHL.Also Read: Oilers’ strategic signings secure core stars Connor McDavid, Mattias Ekholm, and Jake Walman – Is a Stanley Cup finally within reach?","The Utah Mammoth lost 2-1 to the Colorado Avalanche.
