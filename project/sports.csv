Dan Patrick on Tom Brady's 10-year Fox Sports broadcasting gig

Former SportsCenter anchor and host of The Dan Patrick Show, Dan Patrick, was concerned about Tom Brady two months into his 10-year Fox Sports broadcasting gig, calling the arrangement with the six-time Super Bowl winner ""problematic."" Patrick's warning was not designed to generate content for his listeners. The Las Vegas Raiders have indicated that Brady, who is a minority owner, will have a huge say in choosing the team's new head coach and the quarterback successor to the Aidan O'Connell, Gardner Minshew, quarterbacks room issue.Tom Brady's signing a 10-year deal with FOX to call NFL games on television led many to wonder if he'd ever coach again. Now that he's become a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, a team needing a new coach and a plan for the future, assimilation into his new announcing gig only fuels more doubt about his future.Dan Patrick recently discussed the common rumor that Brady will jump ship after announcing the upcoming Super Bowl in New Orleans, highlighting the increasing frequency of such speculations on his Wednesday show. “I just see Brady as a one-and-done,"" he said. ""He does the Super Bowl, and he decides he’s going to be more involved with the Raiders. I just don’t see Tom sort of one foot in and one foot out with the Raiders. He’s too much of a competitor. And it’s one thing, you can compete in this business, like I compete with myself every day. We compete with ourselves each day, but this is different.”Patrick added, “These are wins and losses with Tom. And creating something, building something. And I think that would probably intrigue him, as opposed to being a broadcaster. I mean, Tom can be at a certain level, and he knows that there’ll just be people who don’t like him just because he’s Tom Brady, or he beat their team, or whatever it might be.""Dan Patrick continued, “Tom is competing against Tom. And I don’t know if he gets the same kind of adrenaline rush. Now, he will. When you do a playoff game, when you do a Super Bowl, Tom’s gonna be like, ‘Oh my God, that was awesome,’ but it’s still not that awesome of playing in it or you’re part of a team. He’s used to winning and losing,” said Patrick. “And if you get done with a show, only you decide if you’ve won or lost. ‘Hey, how did I sound?’ ‘Was that good?’ This is different with the Raiders.”Also Read: The iconic quarterback-coach duo of Tom Brady and Bill Belichick might reunite, this time with the Las Vegas Raiders Tom Brady is expected to return for a second season on Fox, despite the potential stigma if he does all of his hype in one season.

NEW DELHI: Known for making controversial remarks, Yograj Singh , father of former India cricketer Yuvraj Singh recently made a shocking revelation, saying he once went to legendary all-rounder Kapil Dev 's house with a pistol to kill him.Yograj, a former India cricketer himself, said that he did so after the 1983 World Cup winner dropped him from the Indian team.Yograj, who played one Test and six ODIs for India in Australia and New Zealand in 1980-81, said that he spared Kapil’s life because of his mother.“When Kapil Dev became captain of India, North Zone, and Haryana, he dropped me for no reason,” Yograj said on “Unfiltered by Samdish.”“My wife (Yuvi’s mother) wanted me to ask Kapil questions. I told her that I would teach this bloody man a lesson.“I took my pistol out, I went to Kapil’s house in Sector 9. He came out with his mother.“I abused him a dozen times. I told him because of you I have lost a friend and what you have done, you will pay for it.“I told him, ‘I want to put a bullet through your head, but I am not doing it because you have a very pious mother, who is standing here.’ I told Shabnam, ‘Let’s go.’“That was the moment I decided I would not play cricket , Yuvi will play.”Yograj also slammed late Bishan Singh Bedi, saying that the former left-arm spinner plotted against him.“These guys, including Bishan Singh Bedi, plotted against me. I never forgave Bishan Singh Bedi. The man died on his bed,” he said.“When I was dropped I spoke to Ravindra Chadha, one of the selectors. He told me that Bishan Singh Bedi (the chief selector) didn’t want to pick me because they thought I was Sunil Gavaskar’s man and because I was playing cricket in Mumbai. I was very close to Gavaskar.”Yograj went on to say that he hasn't spoken to the former India captain in all these years.“In 2011 when India won the World Cup, there was only one guy who was crying, and it was Kapil Dev,” he said.“I did send him a paper cutting that my son did better than you in the World Cup,” he added.Yograj did say that Kapil has apologized to him.“Kapil sent me a WhatsApp text saying we will be brothers in the next life. We will be born from the same mother in the next life. He wanted to meet me. But there is a vengeance, and it still hurts,” said Yograj.","Yograj Singh once went to legendary all-rounder Kapil Dev's house with a pistol to kill him.

"“Screw it”: Travis Kelce reacts to the $14,069 NFL fine for paying homage to Tony Gonzalez after scoring a historic touchdown",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/screw-it-travis-kelce-reacts-to-the-14069-nfl-fine-for-paying-homage-to-tony-gonzalez-after-scoring-a-historic-touchdown/articleshow/117136230.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Travis Kelce opened up about the $14,069 NFL fine

Tony Gonzalez , a legendary tight end in NFL history, achieved 15,127 receiving yards, 1,325 receptions, and 111 touchdowns. His iconic goal post dunk celebration was banned by the NFL after his retirement, leaving fans nostalgic for a simpler era of celebratory football. Travis Kelce , who has redefined the tight end position with over 12,000 receiving yards and seven consecutive 1,000-yard seasons, decided to pay homage to Gonzalez with the move. As a result of the lighthearted moment that mixed two eras of NFL glory, Kelce was fined for the joke that came from Jon Runyan's adoration of the number 69.The Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce was expecting punishment after celebrating his Christmas Day Game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Kelce's 77th career touchdown on December 25 passed Tony Gonzalez for the most receiving touchdowns in Chiefs franchise history , surpassing Hall of Famer.The All-Pro tight end honored the Chiefs icon by dunking the football on the crossbar after scoring a historic touchdown, a gesture that was a special way to commemorate his historic feat. The league eventually fined Kelce $14,069 for his celebration. It was deemed unsportsmanlike conduct after the Chiefs star used the crossbar as a prop.Travis Kelce discussed an incident on his ""New Heights"" podcast with his brother, Jason Kelce, stating that he was ""of course"" punished by the NFL for his antics. He said, ""They said since I touched the goal post it was a fine."" Kelce admitted that his dunk did not go as planned and that it wasn't his best moment.""I was trying to get my (expletive) old ass up there, man,"" Kelce said. ""Fourth quarter of the game, my (expletive) legs are tired after a 10-play drive. ... I'm just like, 'Screw it, I'm gonna send it one time for old time's sake.'""... That was me slapping the backboard. That wasn't me actually flushing it.""In November, Tony Gonzalez offered Kelce a fine if he dunked the ball, but Kelce declined, stating that while he appreciated the gesture, there was no need for the same. ""Tony, you don't have to do that, dude,"" Kelce said on the podcast. ""It was so cool to hear you even say it, dude, but you don't have to help me pay that fine.""Also Read: “Dumb frat boy”: Fans trash Travis Kelce claiming he is out of his league to marry superstar Taylor Swift Tony Gonzalez set a record for the greatest tight end of all time, but Kelce is making a strong case for the title.

MUMBAI: This could be a major, major setback for India, if it comes true. TOI has learnt that ace fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah is in danger of missing the entire Champions Trophy next month due to a back injury.Bumrah, who has swelling on his back, will soon report to the BCCI 's Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru where his recovery will be monitored. It is learnt that he could be out of the game for a considerable period of time due to the injury.The Champions Trophy, which will have the world's top eight ODI teams, begins on February 19, with India playing their league matches in Dubai.The national selectors, who met in Mumbai on Saturday, rested Bumrah from the T20I series at home against England later this month. ""The selectors are yet to get the entire medical report about Bumrah, but at the moment, things don't look good for him.""It remains to be seen if the selectors name Bumrah in the squad of 15 or in the reserves for the Champions Trophy, but even if they do that, it will be more out of hope than anything else. The deadline to announce the squad for the Champions Trophy is Sunday midnight.It has been reported that the BCCI has sought an extension of the deadline, but TOI can confirm that at the point of writing this report, the BCCI has not requested the International Cricket Council to increase the deadline.In the recently concluded five-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in Australia, Bumrah delivered a stellar performance, claiming 32 wickets in 151.2 overs at an extraordinary average of 13.06 and an impressive strike rate of 28.3. He was named as the 'Player of the Series'. However, he couldn't bowl on the final day of the series in the fifth and final Test at Sydney because of his back injury, as Australia successfully chased down 162 and won the series 3-1.In the past, Bumrah has had to endure a long layoff from the game-he was on the sidelines for almost an year from September 2022 to August 2023 due to a back injury which required surgery, before making a comeback in a T20I against Ireland in Ireland.According to sources, chief selector Ajit Agarkar has had discussions with skipper Rohit Sharma and senior batter Virat Kohli about their ""future plans."" Both the batters have been in poor form since the last two series. While Kohli scored 190 runs in five Tests@23.75, Rohit, who opted out of the final Test, managed to score just 31 runs in three Tests@6.20.Explaining why the likes of Rishabh Pant, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill were missing from India's T20I team for the home five-match series against England, which was announced on Saturday, a source in the BCCI said, ""If you notice, apart from Harshit Rana and Nitish Kumar Reddy, all the other players who took part in the gruelling BGT series in Australia recently have been given a break, so that they are fresh for the ODI series against England and then the Champions Trophy.""","Jasprit Bumrah is in danger of missing the entire Champions Trophy due to a back injury. He has swelling on his back and will soon report to the BCCI's Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru. The Champions Trophy, which will have the world's top eight ODI teams, begins on February 19.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117166160,imgsize-38650,width-400,resizemode-4/117166160.jpg"

From Pakistan to UAE: Where cricketing dreams find wings

ILT20 CEO David White on the upcoming third edition, surge in New Zealand cricket

Chasing Shoaib Akhtar's pace

'I want to be the best bowler in ILT20'

NEW DELHI: ""Only 8 runs were needed in the last over. There was a lot of pressure because defending just 8 runs in the last over is very difficult. They had 2 wickets remaining,"" UAE southpaw Muhammad Jawad Ullah recalled. Just a fortnight ago, the pacer was tasked with what many considered nearly impossible. In the final over of the ILT20 Gulf Cricket Championship (GCC), Kuwait needed only a handful of runs to deny UAE their maiden title.Kuwait batter Meet Bhavsar, looking solid at 68 off 52, was the one many would have bet their house on to finish the game off. The start to the over was not suggestive of any late drama either.""The first ball was a wide, and the second delivery went for a four. At that point, I went to the captain, and he gave me a plan,"" Jawad Ullah shared in an exclusive conversation with TimesofIndia.com.What happened next? The answer lay in one name: Jawad Ullah.""I bowled based on the captain's plan and the batter got out,"" Jawad Ullah recounted, vividly remembering the defining moment as his teammate Nilansh Keswani pounced onto an incredible catch, sending dangerous Bhavsar back to the pavilion.The 25-year-old left-arm pace spearhead then smelt blood: ""That was the last wicket, which was easy for me. I bowled a yorker, and he got out too. So, this was an impossible match that we won.""""Getting Bhavsar out was very difficult because he was completely set. But I bowled according to the plan, and we won,"" a satisfied Jawad Ullah, who was named the Player of the Match for his heroics in the eleventh hour, smirked as UAE clinched their first GCC title under the Ring of Fire at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.Hailing from the Malakand district in Pakistan, Jawad Ullah, now 25, has been lulling his cricketing dreams since childhood. In a household of parents, four brothers, and two sisters, cricket was seen more as a tool of entertainment than a pursuit of professional ambition.""In Pakistan, I only played tennis ball cricket. There was no coach or experienced player to guide me. Many people told me to join an academy for hard ball cricket. My thought was that there are so many talented players who don't even get a chance, so I didn't know what it was at that time—maybe fear, or something else,"" Jawad Ullah shared.Life took a pivotal turn in 2020 when Jawad, burdened with family responsibilities, moved to the UAE and found a place to stay in Khor Fakkan, a scenic town in the Gulf of Oman.Thereafter, the twists and turns of life followed as he took up a physically demanding electrician's job. Working long hours from morning to late evening was somewhat nature's ploy to take him away from cricket.Amid the bedlam, a 20-year-old Jawad Ullah would get minimal time to sweat his arms. ""I didn’t get much time to play cricket—only about 1-2 hours. Even then, I played with a tennis ball because playing with a hard ball requires a lot of time, at least 5-6 hours.""Fate intervened when his skills with the tennis ball began catching attention.""There was a brother named Sadiq. He told me that I had talent and said, ‘You should start playing with the hard ball.’ I said, ‘Okay, I’ll start playing with the hard ball.’ So once, I was casually bowling with a hard ball, a man came up to me and said, ‘You bowl really well; play for our team.’ I said, ‘Okay, done.’ From there, I slowly started improving a lot,"" revealed Jawad Ullah.Now certain that playing cricket could be a full-time profession, the once-master of the tennis ball is making waves among his siblings back home.""The youngest of us has a great interest in cricket; he’s also a bowler. The one who is 2 years younger than me stopped playing cricket and focused fully on his studies. But the one who is even younger still plays cricket. He tells me to take him to the UAE, and I tell him, ‘Right now, it’s time for your studies!’ (laughs),"" quipped the 25-year-old, who eventually left his job in 2022 and then made his international debut in a T20I match against Afghanistan in February 2023.Having played 42 T20 matches across T20 leagues and with 60 scalps to his name, Jawad Ullah has already earned loads of plaudits.Recently, former Pakistan pacer Mohammad Amir lavished praise on the left-arm seamer, describing him as one of the most promising talents in UAE cricket during an interaction with TimesofIndia.com.ALSO READ: 'ILT20 is the toughest league in the world': Mohammad Amir| Exclusive ""Yes, Amir bhai and I played together in the Abu Dhabi T10. At that time, we had a conversation in the nets. He told me that if I mastered the slower ball, it would become very difficult for batters to read me. He also praised my inswing, saying that my inswing is really good,"" added the pacer.Reflecting on his debut at the iconic Abu Dhabi ground against Afghanistan, Jawad emphasised the invaluable experience he’s gained. ""Since I made my debut at the Abu Dhabi ground against Afghanistan, I have learned a lot. Playing with so many players, working with coaches and trainers, it feels like brothers teaching and guiding me,"" said Jawad Ullah before revealing his biggest aim.Growing up in Pakistan, a nation renowned for producing world-class fast bowlers, Jawad often found inspiration watching the legends, especially Shoaib Akhtar, on television.""During childhood, when we watched cricket on TV, seeing Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Amir bowl—this was around 2008 or 2009—I was always fascinated by fast bowlers, especially Shoaib Akhtar,"" admitted Jawad Ullah, who could easily clock 130-135 kmph on avarage these days. ""I remember thinking how fast he bowled and dreaming that one day I would also bowl as fast as him. Even today, after all the training and hard work, I haven’t reached his level yet, but one should keep trying.""Jawad Ullah's side Sharjah Warriorz will kick off their ILT20 tournament with a fixture against Gulf Giants on Sunday. Jawad admitted how he had been rigorously preparing for the upcoming season, leaving no stone unturned.""Right now, everything is going really great, and all the players and management are quite happy. Personally, I am training hard, so there's a lot of load on my body. I spend almost an hour in the gym, 4-5 hours bowling, and also have to work on fielding alongside that,"" he explained.For someone brimming with as much talent as this pacer, platforms like the IPL naturally represent a career pinnacle. However, in last year's auction, some unfortunate turn of events saw Jawad Ullah missing out on an IPL bid.""I had sent my name for the IPL, but then, there were some paper-related issues, so it didn't happen. There was some problem with the passport, which is why I couldn't go through.""A fan of former India captain MS Dhoni , Jawad Ullah has just one dream giving him sleepless nights: ""I want to be the best bowler in the ILT20 and win the trophy.""","Jawad Ullah, 25, has been lulling his cricketing dreams since childhood. In the final over of the ILT20 Gulf Cricket Championship (GCC), Kuwait needed only a handful of runs to deny UAE their maiden title. ""I bowled based on the captain's plan and the batter got out,"" he recounted.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117146202,imgsize-43354,width-400,resizemode-4/117146202.jpg"

Fans trashed Tom Brady for his major broadcasting mistake

Tom Brady's first season as Fox's lead NFL color commentator has been a disaster, as he seems unable to speak with any genuine insight without sounding stilted or awkward. The controversy over his ownership of the Las Vegas Raiders and potential conflict of interest as an announcer did not help matters. Despite hopes that Brady would be sharper in the NFC Wild Card game, he was not.The first NFC matchup of Wild Card Weekend saw the Philadelphia Eagles in action against the Green Bay Packers and Jordan Love. If they win, then the Eagles take on the Rams, Commanders, Buccaneers, or Vikings. If they pull off the upset, they'll meet the Detroit Lions. Tom Brady, former quarterback for the Patriots and Bucs, was among the first quarterbacks to call a playoff game, partnered with Fox Sports commentator Kevin Burkhardt and sideline reporter Erin Andrews.Tom Brady mistakenly called the Eagles the Phillies instead of the Eagles, causing a stir on social media. Fans were unhappy with his approach in the booth and took to Twitter to voice their dissatisfaction. ""Tom Brady calling the Eagles the “Phillies” Get him out of the booth!,"" one fan wrote. Another wrote, ""Just get rid of him already."" Another wrote, ""It's almost like he's trying to get fired.”In the first quarter, the seven-time Super Bowl champion made another mistake, discussing the Packers' pass rush and referring to Hurts as ""Love."" ""The challenge I'm seeing already is the lack of pass rush by Green Bay,"" Brady said. ""They just can't put enough pressure on Love. He's standing back there all day and surveyed the field, come back to Grant Calcaterra.""Fans immediately took to Twitter and trolled Brady. ""Tom Brady called Jalen Hurts Love lol,"" one fan said. ""The packer defense can’t get enough pressure on love according to Tom Brady,"" added another. ""Tom Brady just called Hurts 'Love' :(,"" wrote a third. ""Tom Brady just confused 'Hurts' with 'Love.' Oops,"" commented a fourth. ""Tom Brady calling Jalen Hurts 'Love,'"" posted a fifth.Also Read: “Never seen a referee huddle with a QB”: Fans trash Josh Allen and head referee Bill Vinovich after they were seen talking during Bills vs Broncos As reported following Brady's retirement after the 2022 NFL season, he would debut in broadcasting his games with Fox. However, he took off in the 2023 season and started anew in 2024. A broadcaster who comes as Brady, probably the greatest footballer of all time, certainly raises the stakes in terms of entertainment value by NFL games when in the booth, but on his part must mend his ways regarding quarterbacks.","Tom Brady's first season as Fox's lead NFL color commentator has been a disaster.

Cricket Australia has announced its preliminary 15-man squad for the ICC Champions Trophy , set to begin on February 19 . The squad includes fresh faces in Matt Short and Aaron Hardie, both earning their maiden call-ups for a global ICC event. The selection emphasises all-round capabilities, as the team aims to balance depth and versatility for the tournament hosted across Pakistan and the UAE.Nathan Ellis, whose stellar performances led the Hobart Hurricanes to the BBL 14 finals, also finds a spot in the squad. The trio of Short, Hardie, and Ellis replace David Warner, Cameron Green, and Sean Abbott from the team that triumphed in the ODI World Cup 14 months ago. Warner's retirement, Green's back surgery, and Abbott's omission have paved the way for these new entrants.Captain Pat Cummins will lead the side but remains uncertain for the tournament due to an ankle injury sustained during Australia's 3-1 Border-Gavaskar Trophy victory. Cummins is also skipping the Test series in Sri Lanka to be home for the birth of his second child. In his absence, vice-captain Steve Smith is likely to take charge.Australia's group-stage matches will be held in Pakistan, facing Afghanistan, England, and South Africa in Lahore and Rawalpindi. The squad's sole warm-up fixture is an ODI against Sri Lanka in Hambantota on February 16, three days after the second Test in Galle.Selector George Bailey highlighted the team's strategic depth, noting the squad comprises key players from recent successful tours, including the World Cup, West Indies series, and the Pakistan home series. ""This is a balanced and experienced squad offering flexibility based on opposition and conditions,"" Bailey said.Seam bowling has historically been more effective in Pakistan's ODIs, and the team structure reflects this. Adam Zampa is the lone specialist spinner, backed by three pacers and a cadre of all-rounders, including Marsh, Glenn Maxwell , Marcus Stoinis, Short and Hardie.Short has impressed since Warner's retirement, scoring consistently in ODIs and making a notable return in the BBL with a match-winning century for the Adelaide Strikers. Meanwhile, Hardie, who delivered key contributions during the UK tour, has been managing a quad injury but remains a vital inclusion for his dual skills.Selectors opted to omit Jake Fraser-McGurk after a string of low scores in the BBL and recent ODIs. Fraser-McGurk's form has been under scrutiny, with only a single half-century in domestic cricket this season.Australia's campaign will seek to claim the Champions Trophy for the first time since 2009. The format, last played in 2017, features the top two teams from each group progressing to the semi-finals. The final is scheduled for March 9 in either Lahore or Dubai.","Cricket Australia has announced its preliminary 15-man squad for the ICC Champions Trophy, set to begin on February 19.

Sharjah Warriorz 175/7 in 20 overs (Tom Kohler-Cadmore 83 not out, Rohan Mustafa 45, Mark Adair 2 for 23, Blessing Muzarabani 2 for 27)

A dramatic evening at the Dubai International Stadium ended with the Sharjah Warriorz securing a thrilling three-wicket victory over the Gulf Giants in a nail-biting finish on Sunday. The hero of the match was Tom Kohler-Cadmore , whose unbeaten 83 off 56 balls steered the Warriorz to their target of 175 on the very last delivery of the match.Kohler-Cadmore’s sublime knock, studded with six fours and four sixes, was complemented by a crucial contribution from UAE all-rounder Rohan Mustafa , who scored 45 off 33 balls. The duo forged a 105-run partnership that formed the backbone of the chase, propelling the Warriorz to a strong position despite some tense moments in the final overs.Chasing 175, the Warriorz had a shaky start, losing Johnson Charles in the opening over to Daniel Worall and Jason Roy in the second to Mark Adair. However, Kohler-Cadmore and Mustafa stabilised the innings with an aggressive yet calculated approach, guiding their team to 55/2 by the end of the powerplay.Kohler-Cadmore brought up his half-century off just 32 balls, showcasing his ability to find boundaries with ease. Mustafa provided steady support before falling to Blessing Muzarabani in the 13th over, leaving the Warriorz at 119/3.The middle order faltered under pressure, with Bhanuka Rajapaksa and Karim Janat departing cheaply. Keemo Paul offered a glimmer of hope with a brisk 11 off five balls, but his stay was cut short by Muzarabani. As wickets tumbled, the Warriorz needed 24 runs from the final two overs.Adil Rashid struck a vital six in the 19th over, which yielded 14 runs and brought the target within touching distance. With 10 runs required from the last over, Kohler-Cadmore held his nerve, smashing crucial boundaries to seal the victory.Earlier, Gulf Giants struggled to find momentum after being put into bat. Sharjah Warriorz captain Tim Southee led from the front, dismissing Adam Lyth and James Vince in the powerplay. Rehan Ahmed (46 off 27) and Jordan Cox (38 off 32) rebuilt the innings with a 57-run partnership, steering the Giants to 102/4 by the 14th over. Shimron Hetmyer provided a late surge, smashing 36 off 23 balls, including five fours and a six. Mark Adair’s quick-fire 20 not out off 10 deliveries and Saghir Khan’s cameo of 11 runs off four balls pushed the Giants to a competitive total of 174/7. Southee was the standout bowler for the Warriorz, finishing with 3/30.After the match, Kohler-Cadmore expressed relief and satisfaction, saying, “It is great to get off with a win. I would have been devastated had we not got over the line. The pitch played well once you got your eye in; it was easier to hit.”Gulf Giants skipper James Vince praised Kohler-Cadmore’s knock, admitting, “Having someone staying till the end was crucial. He is a quality player, a clean striker of the ball. It was a quality knock.”The result marked a memorable start for the Sharjah Warriorz, who showcased resilience and brilliance under pressure to claim victory in this electrifying contest.",Sharjah Warriorz secure thrilling three-wicket victory over Gulf Giants.

DUBAI: The participation of India's star pacer Jasprit Bumrah in the all-important ICC Champions Trophy 2025 remains uncertain as he continues to recover from a swelling on his back. A decision on his inclusion in the Indian squad is expected soon.Former Pakistan pacer Mohammad Amir believes that Bumrah's absence would put immense pressure on India during the mega tournament, scheduled to begin on February 19.India are placed in Group A alongside Bangladesh, Pakistan, and New Zealand. They will open their campaign on February 20 against Bangladesh in Dubai. Following this, India will face Pakistan and New Zealand on February 23 and March 2, respectively, in their remaining group-stage matches.""The way Pakistan has played recently — defeating Australia in Australia and then beating South Africa — shows their strength, especially in overseas conditions. Considering their recent performances, I think Pakistan will have the upper hand against India. However, India has always been my favorite in big tournaments. But the Indian team is under pressure and facing severe criticism due to their recent defeats,"" Amir told TimesofIndia.com during a group media interaction at the Dubai International Stadium.On Bumrah's potential absence, Amir emphasised his importance to India's bowling unit.""It will be a huge loss to India if Bumrah isn't there. He has been a top bowler for India, leading the pack from the front. Without him, the Indian bowling attack is reduced to 40-50 percent of its strength,"" he said.Bumrah, who has 443 international wickets in 204 games across formats, delivered a stellar performance in the recently concluded Border-Gavaskar Trophy, claiming 32 wickets in the five-match series — the highest by an Indian on foreign soil. His performances earned him the Player of the Series award.Bumrah bowled 151.2 overs or 908 deliveries in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, raising the question of whether this workload contributed to the injury of India's star fast bowler.India's ODI squad for the Champions Trophy is yet to be announced, and Bumrah's fitness remains a key concern.

This win marks the first trophy for Barcelona under manager Hansi Flick .Barcelona's impressive performance helped them secure a record-extending 15th Spanish Super Cup title. Kylian Mbappe gave Real Madrid an early lead. However, Barcelona responded with five goals before their goalkeeper, Wojciech Szczesny, received a red card in the second half.Real Madrid aimed to avenge their 4-0 home loss against Barcelona in La Liga back in October. Instead, they suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of their rivals in Jeddah.Following Mbappe's opening goal, Lamine Yamal equalised for Barcelona. Robert Lewandowski then put Barcelona ahead with a penalty kick. Raphinha scored twice, and Alejandro Balde also found the net.Rodrygo Goes managed to score a free-kick for Real Madrid, but they couldn't capitalise on their numerical advantage after Szczesny's sending-off. The defeat was a humbling experience for the European champions.""I think today is a good day because we beat one of the best teams in the world, for the second time this season, Real Madrid, and this is unbelievable. We won a title here and we are really happy... today is a day to look positively at this team,"" Flick said after the match.Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti attributed the heavy defeat to his team's defensive shortcomings.""We defended badly and that cost us the game -- they found their goals quite easily. We're sad, like all our fans, it's disappointing and we don't have to hide that... we have to look forwards, there's nothing else we can do,"" Ancelotti said.Despite Barcelona's strong start, Real Madrid took the lead in the fifth minute. Kylian Mbappe scored a brilliant counter-attack goal.The French forward, who had been frustrated by offside calls in the previous league defeat against Barcelona, broke free after Vinicius Jr . won possession. He then sprinted into the penalty area and chipped the ball past Szczesny.Lamine Yamal, the 17-year-old winger, scored a stunning individual goal to level the score. He cut in from the right and placed a low shot inside the near post, reminiscent of Lionel Messi.Barcelona continued to press forward and took the lead with a penalty kick converted by Robert Lewandowski. The penalty was awarded after Eduardo Camavinga's late and reckless challenge on Gavi.Raphinha extended Barcelona's lead with a header from Jules Kounde's cross. Barcelona then scored their fourth goal before halftime on a counter-attack. Yamal and Raphinha combined, and Raphinha set up Alejandro Balde, who calmly slotted the ball past Thibaut Courtois.Barcelona maintained their momentum in the second half. Raphinha scored their fifth goal with a skillful dribble and finish after being played in by Marc Casado.Barcelona was reduced to 10 men when Mbappe was brought down outside the penalty area by goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. Mbappe had rounded Szczesny, and after a VAR review, the goalkeeper was sent off.Rodrygo, who had earlier hit the post, converted the resulting free-kick past Szczesny's replacement, Inaki Pena.Mbappe created a chance for Jude Bellingham, but the English midfielder's shot was blocked by a superb challenge from Jules Kounde in stoppage time.Mbappe also came close to scoring again with a fine individual effort, but his shot was saved by Inaki Pena.","Barcelona beat Real Madrid 5-2 in the Spanish Super Cup Clasico final held in Saudi Arabia.

Concerns over squad composition

NEW DELHI: India's 15-member squad for the upcoming five-match T20I series against England, starting January 22 in Kolkata, was announced on Saturday. Suryakumar Yadav will lead the side, with spin bowler Axar Patel serving as his deputy.However, the squad announcement has sparked discussions, particularly over the exclusion of wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant and opener Yashasvi Jaiswal Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra , speaking on his YouTube channel, delved into these notable omissions and their implications for India's cricketing plans.Chopra raised eyebrows at the decision to pick Dhruv Jurel as the backup wicketkeeper while omitting Rishabh Pant. ""In the last T20I series [in South Africa], the team had Jitesh Sharma, who didn't get a game. Now Dhruv Jurel has been selected. Jurel has good temperament and potential, but in T20s, he is yet to make a name. He is picked purely on his potential, but he won't find a place in the playing XI,"" Chopra said.He expressed surprise at Pant's absence, calling him a ""generational talent"" and emphasising his value to the team. ""You picked Dhruv Jurel and not Rishabh Pant. That's very interesting. It's not like Pant is out of T20I schemes or considered unfit for white-ball cricket. So early in someone's career, should we make that call? I still believe Pant is an asset, the kind of player we should invest in,"" Chopra remarked.He suggested that clarity from the selectors is vital, especially for experienced players like Pant during transitional phases. ""Selectors should provide explanations to players. If not done, it weakens the foundation of the new setup during a transition period,"" he added.Chopra also addressed Yashasvi Jaiswal's exclusion, speculating that he might be in line for the upcoming Champions Trophy. ""Yashasvi's name is missing. I think they are considering him for the Champions Trophy and possibly the three-match ODI series against England. But he could've been in the T20I squad,"" Chopra said.He pointed out the competition between Jaiswal and Abhishek Sharma for a spot, questioning why the selectors didn't give Jaiswal a chance. ""Abhishek Sharma has already played 11-12 matches but hasn't scored enough runs or cemented his place. Yashasvi could have been given an opportunity in the playing XI. My question is, has Yashasvi's time not yet arrived in white-ball cricket?""Chopra also critiqued the lack of a third opener in the squad, highlighting potential risks in a five-match series. ""Why don't they pick a third opener? They didn't select one for the South Africa series either. If one opener falls ill, who will open? Tilak Varma or Washington Sundar? They could have gone for an extra opener,"" he questioned.","India's 15-member squad for the upcoming five-match T20I series against England, starting January 22 in Kolkata, was announced on Saturday.

DUBAI: Sharjah Warriorz have struggled in the first two seasons of the ILT20 , but the arrival of New Zealand legend Tim Southee as captain could turn the team’s fortunes around this year.In the inaugural season in 2023, the Warriorz managed to win only three of their 10 matches, finishing fifth in the standings. The following year, their performance dipped further, as they ended at the bottom of the table with just four wins in 10 matches.With Southee set to make his ILT20 debut and taking on the responsibility of captaincy, the seasoned New Zealander is optimistic about leading the team to its first title victory.caught up with Southee, a veteran of 107 Tests, 161 ODIs, and 126 T20Is, to discuss the third edition of the ILT20, the team’s composition, and much more.It's an exciting tournament.

We’re looking forward to the challenges over the next month, and hopefully, this year will be much better for Sharjah Warriorz.I'm really excited to work with JP. I've played a lot against him over the years and always admired the way he approached the game.

Jason Roy comes to mind immediately. He’s been exceptional in franchise cricket and for England over the years. Another is Adam Milne - his skill with the ball is incredible. Those are two players who I think can really make a difference.I think the responsibility is the same. As captain, you have a job to do - whether you're a batter or a bowler. From my experience, bowlers often appreciate having a captain who understands what it’s like to be in their shoes. It gives you a unique perspective as a leader. I’m looking forward to the challenge.

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

NEW DELHI: Gautam Gambhir 's tenure as India's head coach has been a topic of intense discussion, with mixed performances across formats drawing attention to his leadership. While his influence in T20 cricket has been widely praised, the results in Tests and ODIs have raised questions about the challenges he faced early in his stint.India began well under Gambhir in Test cricket with a 2-0 series win over Bangladesh, but things quickly turned difficult with a 0-3 defeat to New Zealand and a 1-3 loss to Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Reflecting on this, Dinesh Karthik , speaking on Cricbuzz, commented, ""The Bangladesh series was a success, and I think post that, things have gone downhill for him in Tests.""Karthik acknowledged the difficulties Gambhir faces, stepping into the role after Rahul Dravid 's successful stint. ""You've got to give Gambhir some slack. He has come in at a very tough time post the successful regime of Rahul Dravid. It's never easy to fill those shoes,"" Karthik said.Gambhir's remarks about the future of senior players Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli following the Australia series also sparked interest. On this, Karthik shared, ""He [Gambhir] wants them [Rohit and Kohli] to take a decision as to what they feel is best.""In the ODI format, India has played only a handful of matches under Gambhir, including a series loss to Sri Lanka. ""When it comes to ODIs, they haven't played too much, but also remember they lost the series against Sri Lanka. So, it hasn't been easy in Tests and a very small sample size for ODIs,"" Karthik noted.The coach's success in T20 cricket, however, has been a bright spot. ""He has found immense success in T20 cricket. He has a lot of young boys, and he has been able to have a massive influence over them,"" Karthik remarked, contrasting this with the struggles in Tests.When assessing Gambhir's impact, Karthik pointed to the importance of harmony between the coach's vision and the players' mindset. ""The biggest decision for him to make is: Is he very happy with this current set of players? Is he able to influence them over decision-making? Are they aligned with his thought process? If these players are fitting in, then great. If not, then we have to figure out what is the best way moving forward. Test cricket has been hard for Gautam Gambhir as the coach.""Karthik concluded by acknowledging the challenges Gambhir faces and the limited influence a coach can have during matches. ""The pressure is mounting. All he can do is give them freedom, give them the security they want in the dressing room, and try to keep a very nice and safe even sort of place there. But when the player walks out, he has to find a way to counter his demons and the opposition's questions,"" he concluded.",Gautam Gambhir's tenure as India's head coach has been a topic of intense discussion. His mixed performances across formats have raised questions about his leadership.

Haryana squeeze through

Brief scores:

NEW DELHI: Vidarbha secured a dominant nine-wicket victory over Rajasthan, while Haryana narrowly defeated Gujarat by two wickets in the Vijay Hazare Trophy semi-finals in Vadodara on Sunday.The thrilling matches have set the stage for exciting semi-final clashes. Haryana will face Karnataka on Wednesday, and Vidarbha will take on Maharashtra on Thursday.Karun Nair 's exceptional form continued with his fifth century of the tournament. He scored an unbeaten 122 off just 82 balls, smashing 13 fours and 5 sixes. This was his fourth century in the last five innings.Dhruv Shorey provided excellent support, also scoring an unbeaten century (118 off 131 balls). Their unbroken 200-run partnership for the second wicket propelled Vidarbha to victory, chasing down a target of 292 in just 43.3 overs.Nair's remarkable run has amassed him 664 runs in eight matches.The achievement places him alongside Devdutt Padikkal, Kumar Sangakkara, and Alviro Petersen, each having achieved four consecutive List A hundreds.Narayan Jagadeesan currently holds the record for most consecutive List A hundreds, scoring five in a row during the 2021-22 Vijay Hazare Trophy.Nair entered the crease at one down, joining Shorey and Yash Rathod, who had already established a strong 92-run opening partnership. He flawlessly continued the momentum, guiding Vidarbha to victory.Earlier, Rajasthan's batsmen struggled to convert their starts into substantial scores.Kartik Sharma (62) and Shubham Garhwal (59) were the top scorers for Rajasthan. Deepak Chahar (31), Deepak Hooda (45), and skipper Mahipal Lomror (32) also made contributions, but none managed to anchor the innings.Yash Thakur's impressive bowling figures of 4/39 helped restrict Rajasthan to a sub-300 total. His economical spell played a crucial role in Vidarbha's victory.Haryana clinched a victory against Gujarat, chasing down a target of 197. Their win wasn't easy, thanks to a compelling performance by Indian leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi, who took 4 wickets for 46 runs.Gujarat's Hemang Patel scored a respectable 54 runs off 62 balls. However, the efforts of Haryana's Anuj Thakral and Nishant Sindhu, each claiming three wickets, hampered Gujarat's innings.Himanshu Rana played a crucial role in Haryana's chase, scoring 66 runs off 89 balls. Other batsmen contributed smaller scores, enabling Haryana to reach the target.Gujarat's captain, Axar Patel, who is part of India's T20I squad against England, had a disappointing match.He only managed three runs and failed to take any wickets in his 10 overs, conceding 41 runs. Despite setting what seemed like a manageable target, Gujarat ultimately couldn't defend their total against a determined Haryana side.Bishnoi's impressive spell nearly tipped the scales in their favor, but Haryana's batting depth proved sufficient.Gujarat: 196 all out in 45.2 overs (Hemang Patel 54, Chintan Gaja 32; Anuj Thakral 3/39, Nishant Sindhu 3/40) lost to Haryana: 201/8 in 44 overs (Himanshu Rana 66, Parth Vats 38; Ravi Bishnoi 4/46) by 2 wickets.Rajasthan: 291/8 in 50 overs (Kartik Sharma 62, Shubham Garhwal 59, Deepak Hooda 45, Deepak Chahar 31; Yash Thakur 4/39) lost to Vidarbha: 292/1 in 43.3 overs (Karun Nair 122 not out, Dhruv Shorey 118 not out) by 9 wickets.","Vidarbha beat Rajasthan by nine wickets to reach Vijay Hazare Trophy semi- finals.

MUMBAI: Even as the International Cricket Council's deadline for all the eight teams to pick their provisional squads for the Champions Trophy in UAE & Pakistan expires at midnight on Jan 12 (Sunday), the BCCI is likely to seek an extension and announce India's provisional squad only on January 19, a month before the tournament, which begins on Feb 19. However, at the time of writing this, the BCCI had not requested an extension of the deadline in this regard from the ICC .""The Champions Trophy squad is likely to be announced on Jan 19,"" BCCI vice-president Rajiv Shukla told reporters on Sunday at the BCCI's headquarters, just after the Board's Special General Meeting, where Devajit Saikia and Prabhtej Singh Bhatia were announced as the new BCCI secretary and treasurer.On Saturday, the national selection committee, led by Ajit Agarkar , only picked the Indian side for the five-match T20I series against England, postponing the three-match ODI series against England—the ODIs are supposed to be played on Feb 6, 9, & 12—and the provisional squad for the ICC Champions Trophy later.TOI understands that as per the ICC rule, all the teams are supposed to submit their provisional squads by 23.59 pm on Jan 12, but the BCCI is likely to ask for an extension in that regard.Normally, all the teams are supposed to submit their provisional squads a month in advance, but this time the ICC has stretched that period to five weeks. Of course, the teams are allowed to change their squads later.","International Cricket Council's deadline for all the eight teams to pick their provisional squads for the Champions Trophy in UAE & Pakistan expires at midnight on Jan 12.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh fast bowler Tanzim Hasan Sakib found himself at the center of controversy during a Bangladesh Premier League match while representing Sylhet Strikers against Khulna Tigers .The incident occurred on the first ball of the 17th over when Tanzim dismissed Pakistan all-rounder Mohammad Nawaz . It was a clever slower delivery, and Nawaz was completely deceived, offering an easy catch to short third man.After the catch was taken, Tanzim exchanged words with Nawaz, and as they approached each other, the Pakistan star appeared to initiate a shoulder bump with Tanzim.The two players began arguing, leading to a heated altercation, with Tanzim pointing towards the dressing room. Nawaz appeared visibly frustrated, but other players stepped in to separate them and prevent further escalation.Earlier in the season, Tanzim had also been involved in a minor scuffle with Towhid Hridoy and had been part of some banter at the international level as well.Recently, star India batter Virat Kohli shoulder-bumped Australian debutant Sam Konstas during the opening day of the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Melbourne.The collision quickly escalated into a heated exchange between the two players. Australian opener Usman Khawaja and umpire Michael Gough intervened, stepping in to mediate and diffuse the situation.","Tanzim Hasan Sakib was involved in a scuffle during a Bangladesh Premier League match.

In an alarming coincidence, each of their three home losses in this ISL campaign have come by that very scoreline.In a game that took until the second half to come to life, it was Mohammed Sanan who set the visitors on their way in the 64th minute with a clinical finish.Just as Mumbai City so nearly drew level when Nikolaos Karelis's left-footed effort stung Albino Gomes's palms in the closing minutes, Jordan Murray (86th) sealed the three points for Khalid Jamil's side following a quick break after Jamshedpur had won back possession.There was time for one final dagger which arrived in stoppage time as Javi Hernandez (90+6) fired home from inside the box.The win saw Jamshedpur climb to third place, level on points with Bengaluru (27pts) with a game in hand. Mumbai, meanwhile, still occupy sixth spot and that final playoff berth, but were left to rue another bitter outing at home. Although they went into this game with a confidence-boosting 3-2 win at East Bengal last week, there is no doubt that the Islanders are finding goals hard to come by this season.Coach Petr Kratky has even resorted to switching captain Lallianzuala Chhangte from his favoured position on the right of their usual three-man attack to playing in the hole behind the front three.It would yield no dividends on this occasion, as Jamshedpur's backline were disciplined enough to deal with anything Karelis, Vikram Partap Singh or Bipin Singh were able to ask of them.To make matters worse, Chhangte was sent off after the game for dissent.","Jamshedpur beat Mumbai City 0-3 at the Mumbai Football Arena.

Altay Bayindir was the unexpected hero for Manchester United as they edged past Arsenal in a dramatic FA Cup encounter at the Emirates. The match ended 1-1 after 90 minutes, and United triumphed 5-4 on penalties, with Bayindir making crucial saves both in normal time and during the shootout to send the holders into the fourth round.United took the lead early in the second half when Bruno Fernandes unleashed a thunderous strike into the top corner, capitalising on a slip by Gabriel after Alejandro Garnacho's incisive run. However, the game turned when Diogo Dalot received a second yellow card on the hour mark for a reckless challenge, leaving United to defend with 10 men for over half an hour.Arsenal wasted no time exploiting their numerical advantage as Gabriel Magalhães scored the equaliser, with Bayindir failing to deal with Gabriel Martinelli’s cross, resulting in a deflected shot finding the net.Despite dominating possession and creating multiple chances, Arsenal failed to capitalise. Their woes were compounded when Bayindir saved Martin Odegaard’s penalty following a controversial decision against Harry Maguire, who was furious at the call and clashed with Kai Havertz during the ensuing melee.Bayindir redeemed himself further with a stunning stop to deny Declan Rice and another to keep Havertz at bay as Arsenal squandered golden opportunities to secure the win in regulation.In the penalty shootout, United were flawless. Fernandes, Amad Diallo, Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez, and Josua Zirkzee all converted their spot-kicks, with Zirkzee calmly scoring the decisive penalty. Bayindir’s save against Havertz in the shootout proved pivotal, capping a remarkable performance for the Turkish goalkeeper.The defeat deepens Arsenal’s recent struggles, coming on the back of a League Cup semi-final first-leg loss to Newcastle. Manager Mikel Arteta expressed his frustration, stating, ""We deserved to win based on performance, but the reality is we’re out.""Arsenal’s misery was compounded by the sight of Gabriel Jesus being stretchered off in the first half with a suspected knee injury, adding to their growing list of absentees.For United, the win was a testament to their resilience under manager Ruben Amorim, who praised his side’s character in a hard-fought victory.

Carlo Ancelotti calls on Real Madrid to avoid repeating Clasico mistakes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/carlo-ancelotti-calls-on-real-madrid-to-avoid-repeating-clasico-mistakes/articleshow/117146797.cms,"Carlo Ancelotti (AP Photo)

Real Madrid's coach, Carlo Ancelotti, believes his team can avenge their previous defeat against Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final on Sunday. He emphasized the importance of learning from past mistakes to secure a victory.Barcelona had convincingly defeated Real Madrid 4-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu in La Liga earlier in the season. However, Real Madrid managed to surpass them in the league standings before the winter break.“We have to think about that game obviously, they beat us, we had a clear evaluation of what happened.”Ancelotti acknowledged the significance of the previous encounter and the need to analyze their performance. He stressed the importance of replicating the positive aspects of their play while avoiding past errors.“We started the game well, then had problems in the second half, so we have to try and repeat the good things we did and avoid the mistakes we made.”The added pressure of a final against their rivals adds another layer of complexity to the upcoming match. Ancelotti acknowledged the unique nature of Clasico finals.“The Clasico is even more pressured when it's a final, we've played a lot against Barcelona and playing a final against them is always something special.”Real Madrid's challenge lies in finding a balance between their attacking prowess and defensive solidity, especially after Kylian Mbappe 's arrival. The attacking quartet of Mbappe, Vinicius Junior, Jude Bellingham, and Rodrygo Goes offers significant offensive firepower. However, their defensive contributions are crucial for team balance.“(In recent Clasicos) individual quality has prevailed over team balance.”Ancelotti highlighted the importance of collective effort and defensive stability in such high-stakes matches.“An important aspect tomorrow will be balance and collective work -- defending.”He firmly believes that a strong defensive performance increases their chances of winning.“If you defend well, there's more chance of winning.”Despite a successful 2024 season with La Liga and Champions League titles, Ancelotti admitted that the heavy defeat against Barcelona remained a low point.“We're close to another trophy, we're thinking positively, but we know that in football anything can happen, above all when the opponent is strong and competes well like Barcelona.”Ancelotti acknowledged the unpredictable nature of football, particularly against a strong opponent like Barcelona. He also highlighted Real Madrid's progress and improvement as a team.“Our team has improved, nobody can argue with that.”He expressed confidence in their continued progress regardless of the outcome of the Super Cup final.“A defeat wouldn't be good but the team is not going backwards, it will keep moving forwards.”Dani Olmo's availability for Barcelona after a controversial temporary license approval by the Spanish national sports council (CSD) presents a challenge for Real Madrid.“Olmo will play and we have to minimise his quality.”Ancelotti chose to focus on minimizing Olmo's impact on the game rather than commenting on the controversy surrounding his eligibility.Barcelona coach Hansi Flick confirmed Olmo's readiness to play but hinted at a possible starting role for Gavi.“Gavi had a great performance against Athletic, he's got confidence... I think he's is going to play, but I am not 100 percent sure of who will play.”The Super Cup final represents Flick's first opportunity to win a trophy with Barcelona. He acknowledged the importance of a victory for the team's confidence.“If we win, we will have more confidence for the rest of the season.”He further emphasized the significance of winning the game for everyone involved.“Winning the game would be something really big for everyone.”",Real Madrid face Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final on Sunday.

Aston Villa came from behind to end Graham Potter 's debut as West Ham United manager on a losing note in the FA Cup on Friday.West Ham squandered a 1-0 lead to concede twice and lose 1-2 in the third round of the tournament .Potter was appointed as Julen Lopetegui's successor just a day before the match, as West Ham couldn't build on the early advantage after Lucas Paqueta's strike.In bitter cold conditions, Unai Emery's squad demonstrated their resilience with a commanding second-half performance that highlighted West Ham's defensive weaknesses. Amadou Onana drew Villa level before Morgan Rogers struck the decisive goal, leaving Potter visibly dejected.The defeat marked Potter's return to management following his departure from Chelsea in April 2023. His tenure at Stamford Bridge had been brief and challenging, with 11 defeats in 31 matches and a disappointing 11th-place position in the Premier League.With merely one training session before travelling to Villa and the absence of crucial strikers Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio, Potter faced significant challenges.Despite these limitations, the attacking display from West Ham showed promise, though addressing their defensive vulnerabilities remains the primary concern.Lopetegui struggled to maintain the robust framework established by David Moyes, who secured the Europa Conference League in 2023 before departing at the season's conclusion.Potter demonstrated his ability to address these tactical concerns as West Ham displayed impressive attacking prowess against Villa in the first half.Paqueta nearly provided Potter with an ideal beginning when the Brazilian's attempt from the area's periphery narrowly missed the target.It was a warning Villa failed to heed as Paqueta opened the scoring in the ninth minute.Summerville displayed his skill by outmanoeuvring Villa's Maatsen during a decisive run into the box, before delivering a precise pass to Paqueta, who finished expertly past Olsen.The new manager's jubilant celebration was short-lived, as German forward Fullkrug had to leave the pitch with an injury shortly after the goal.Continuing his impressive performance, Paqueta tested Olsen again following another penetrating attack.Villa's persistence after the interval paid off in the 71st minute. A corner kick saw Mings direct the ball towards Maatsen, whose shot was parried by Fabianski into Onana's path, allowing him to score from close range.Villa, sensing an opportunity, pressed forward in the 76th minute. Watkins advanced into West Ham's penalty area and set up Rogers, who finished precisely into the bottom corner.",West Ham squandered a 1-0 lead to concede twice and lose 1-2 in the third round of the tournament. The defeat marked Potter's return to management following his departure from Chelsea in April 2023.
