Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders get hero’s farewell as Colorado honors duo in style



Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter , two of college football ’s brightest stars, will be immortalized in Colorado Buffaloes history this Saturday as their jersey numbers—No. 2 and No. 12—are officially retired during the Spring Game. The duo, who propelled the University of Colorado to a new era of national relevance under head coach Deion Sanders , will return to Folsom Field for a ceremony that is as symbolic as it is historic.Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter weren’t just teammates—they were the beating heart of a Colorado program that underwent a dramatic transformation in just two seasons. In 2022, the Buffs posted a dismal 1-11 record. But after the arrival of Coach Prime and his talented son Shedeur, along with two-way phenom Travis Hunter, Colorado surged to 4-8 in 2023 and finished 2024 with a stunning 9-4 record—their best season since 2016.Travis Hunter’s 2024 season was nothing short of legendary. Dominating on both sides of the ball, he hauled in 96 receptions for 1,258 yards and 16 touchdowns while also recording 35 tackles, four interceptions, and 11 passes defensed as a lockdown corner. His efforts earned him a clean sweep of college football’s highest honors. “He became the most honored player in the history of college football in 2024,” the school noted, as he claimed the Heisman Trophy, the Walter Camp Award, and both the AP and Sporting News Player of the Year accolades. He also won the Paul Hornung Award—again—and was named the nation's best wide receiver and best defensive player.But Hunter’s brilliance extended beyond the field. He was named to the Academic All-American First Team and was honored as the Academic All-American of the Year, becoming only the second Colorado athlete to achieve that distinction. Over his collegiate career, he totaled 153 receptions, 1,989 yards, and 20 touchdowns on offense, while adding 67 tackles and seven interceptions defensively.His quarterback, Shedeur Sanders, made an equally significant mark. Often compared to top NFL talents, Sanders threw for 4,134 yards and 37 touchdowns in 2024, cementing his status as one of the top quarterbacks in the nation. Despite some variance in draft stock discussions, he's widely projected as the No. 2 QB in the class behind Cam Ward and has reportedly drawn strong interest from teams like the New York Giants and New Orleans Saints. The Pittsburgh Steelers, picking at No. 21, are also said to be in the mix.Both Sanders and Hunter are expected to be first-round picks in the upcoming NFL Draft , with Hunter potentially going in the top three. The Cleveland Browns have reportedly shown interest in the versatile Hunter, underscoring just how coveted he has become.With their jersey retirement , Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter join a revered group of Buffaloes legends—Byron White (No. 24), Joe Romig (No. 67), Bobby Anderson (No. 11), and Rashaan Salaam (No. 19). Notably, Salaam and Hunter now stand alone as the only Heisman winners in Colorado’s storied history.Also Read: ""He will be the death of me"": Joe Burrow steals the spotlight at Sam Hubbard’s wedding as a clip of him goes viral and fans are going crazy over it",Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter will be immortalized in Colorado Buffaloes history as their jersey numbers are retired.

Chiefs' Christmas wish may go ungranted as NFL hesitates on making it a tradition



NFL and Buffalo Bills schedule hints and predictions with Broadcast VP | Always Gameday in Buffalo

The Kansas City Chiefs have become an integral part of the NFL Christmas Day game schedule over the past two years, thrilling fans with high-profile matchups during the holiday season. As the NFL continues to expand its holiday presence—once dominated by the NBA—Kansas City has made it known they want to be the league’s go-to team for December 25 games. However, the NFL seems reluctant to solidify any such tradition just yet.Much like how the Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys have long-standing Thanksgiving game traditions, the Chiefs recently submitted a formal request to the NFL, expressing interest in becoming a permanent host team on Christmas Day. The logic is simple: Kansas City is arguably the league’s most marketable franchise at the moment. Between their dominance on the field—frequenting Super Bowls—and the off-field buzz created by stars like Travis Kelce and his high-profile relationship with Taylor Swift, the Chiefs are ratings gold.Yet, despite the appeal, the NFL is not ready to tie itself to one team. On the “It’s Always Gameday in Buffalo” podcast, Mike North, the NFL’s Vice President of Broadcast Planning and Scheduling, addressed the Chiefs' request and explained the league’s stance.“For a team like the Chiefs to volunteer for Christmas while they’re busy winning every other Super Bowl or whatever it is, and their tight end is dating the biggest pop star on the planet, sure, the league office would love for the Chiefs to host every year, thanks for volunteering, boys,” North said.“I’m not sure that’s gonna become a tradition quite the way Thanksgiving is. Think about what it took for that tradition, right? The Lions since the ‘30s, the Cowboys since the ‘60s,” North said. “We didn’t commit to a third site on Thanksgiving when we brought that back about 20 years ago. We’ve rotated that around. I imagine we’re gonna keep rotating Christmas around too.”The NFL's cautious approach is rooted in its desire to remain agile. Committing to a team for annual holiday games requires considering both short-term popularity and long-term viability. While the Chiefs are currently a juggernaut, North highlighted that the future is unpredictable.“I know the Chiefs are raising their hands supposedly, but that’s a lot to ask your fans to come out every year on Christmas,” North said. “Certainly, while you’re good and you’re winning AFC West titles and fighting for Super Bowl, it’s an easy give. Five years from now, after Patrick Mahomes retires and they’re not the perennial champion and in every AFC Championship game, I’m not sure we’d want to be married to a site. There are other teams that have raised their hands to become permanent hosts of things like Black Friday or Christmas, thus far we’ve avoided to committing to something like that.”This year, the NFL is upping the ante with a Christmas Day tripleheader, split between Netflix and Amazon. Kansas City featured in the past two Christmas slates—losing to the Raiders at home in 2023, and bouncing back with a dominant 29-10 win over the Steelers in Pittsburgh last year. But despite their consistent appearances and undeniable entertainment value, they are not guaranteed a repeat slot.As the NFL prepares to release its official schedule post-draft, fans of the Kansas City Chiefs will be watching closely. Will the reigning AFC powerhouse get the holiday spotlight once again? While the league remains non-committal, one thing is clear: the Chiefs are eager to make Christmas football a Kansas City tradition. Whether the NFL allows it to happen remains a storyline to follow in seasons to come.Also Read: Jayden Daniels' dance with mom Regina Jackson steals spotlight at Brandon Aiyuk’s wedding","The Kansas City Chiefs have become an integral part of the NFL Christmas Day game schedule over the past two years.

Did Aaron Rodgers just get rejected by the Vikings?

Aaron Rodgers’ bold pitch: mentor J.J McCarthy, chase a ring

Steelers show interest, but no deal yet

Is the NFL moving on from its aging icons?

Aaron Rodgers is no stranger to headline-making decisions, but this offseason is shaping up to be one of the most unpredictable chapters of his storied career. Over a month into NFL free agency, the former Green Bay Packers and New York Jets quarterback remains unsigned — and his recent attempt to land with the Minnesota Vikings didn’t go as planned.According to sources close to the situation, Rodgers had his eyes set on joining the Vikings, a move that would have sent shockwaves through the NFC North. His plan? Serve as a mentor to the team’s young quarterback J.J. McCarthy while also leading a potential Super Bowl push. It was a strategic pitch — pairing his veteran leadership with the raw talent of a rookie in hopes of a deep playoff run.But the Vikings declined.Minnesota is choosing to go all-in on McCarthy, signaling confidence in the 2024 draft pick’s potential to grow into their long-term franchise QB. Rather than splitting the leadership or slowing McCarthy’s development, the Vikings opted to build around youth — a decision that many believe speaks volumes about the league’s shifting priorities.With the Vikings off the table, the Pittsburgh Steelers appear to be the only team showing serious interest in Rodgers. Still, no deal has materialized. The hesitation may be due to Rodgers’ injury history, high salary demands, or teams prioritizing long-term quarterback development over short-term wins.Rodgers, who threw for 3,897 yards and 28 touchdowns last season, clearly still has gas left in the tank. But at 41, he’s entering a market that seems more hesitant than ever to invest in aging superstars.The Vikings’ decision may mark a turning point in how NFL teams view older quarterbacks. Rather than chasing quick success with veterans, franchises are increasingly focusing on grooming young talent. It’s a tough reality for Rodgers, whose resume includes four MVPs and a Super Bowl title — but no current job.As the draft approaches and team strategies evolve, Rodgers could still find a landing spot. But for now, his future hangs in the balance, and one thing is clear: the league may be ready to move on, even if Rodgers isn’t.Also Read: New York Jets shock the NFL by cutting Aaron Rodgers and doubling down on Allen Lazard with $11M deal","The Minnesota Vikings declined to offer Aaron Rodgers a contract.

NEW DELHI: Yuzvendra Chahal once again proved why he's one of the most lethal spinners in IPL history, turning the game on its head as Punjab Kings (PBKS) pulled off a sensational win over Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in Mullanpur on Tuesday.After his dazzling four-wicket haul, popular radio jockey and social media personality RJ Mahvash took to Instagram and wrote, “What a talented man! Highest wicket-taker in IPL for a reasonnnn!!! ASAMBHAV!”Amid rumours of their relationship, screenshots of the post quickly went viral, capturing the sentiment of millions who watched the dramatic finish unfold.Defending a meager total of 111, PBKS looked all but out of the contest until Chahal stepped in.Introduced in the eighth over, the wily spinner immediately made an impact, dismissing Ajinkya Rahane with a controversial LBW.Although the replay suggested the impact was outside off-stump, Rahane opted against the review and walked back, later taking full responsibility for the dismissal.Chahal’s brilliance continued as he removed Angkrish Raghuvanshi in his very next over, followed by back-to-back scalps of Rinku Singh and Ramandeep Singh in his third, putting him on a hat-trick.Even though Andre Russell tried to spoil the party with some big hits in Chahal’s final over, the damage had already been done.Chahal wrapped up with incredible figures of 4/28.What made the performance even more remarkable was that Chahal was playing with a shoulder niggle.“He had a fitness test before the game,” revealed coach Ricky Ponting. “But Chahal told me, ‘Coach, I am absolutely fine.’ And then he delivered magic.”With this win, PBKS stunned everyone, etching this match into IPL folklore.

JD Vance mishandles Buckeyes’ championship trophy during White House event



JD Vance fumbles college football championship trophy as Ohio State visits White House

Vice President JD Vance stole the spotlight on Monday — not just for his speech, but for a slip-up that instantly went viral. While honoring the Ohio State Buckeyes ' national championship win on the White House South Lawn, Vance, a proud alumnus of the university, accidentally dropped the College Football Playoff’s national championship trophy in front of a crowd that included the team, President Donald Trump, and members of the media.The moment occurred as the ceremony drew to a close. In an enthusiastic gesture, Vance attempted to lift the impressive 3-foot trophy from a table onstage. TreVeyon Henderson, Ohio State’s standout running back, assisted by holding the top while Vance took the base. However, the trophy, a modular piece consisting of a 26.5-inch ""ascending virtual football"" made of 24-karat gold and stainless steel atop a 12-inch bronze base, unexpectedly split apart — and the base dropped with a loud thud.Gasps and laughter rippled through the audience as Henderson and another player managed to hold onto the top half of the trophy. Quick to recover from the embarrassing mishap, Vance picked up the base and later joined head coach Ryan Day in posing with the gleaming upper portion of the prize.True to form, the Vice President laughed off the incident online, quipping, “I didn’t want anyone after Ohio State to get the trophy so I decided to break it.” The moment, shared across social platforms, drew chuckles and headlines, and even drew comparisons to other infamous trophy blunders in sports history — from Maria Sharapova’s U.S. Open trophy toppling off in 2006 to Real Madrid's bus runover of the Copa del Rey in 2011.Despite the awkward turn, the event itself was filled with pride and celebration. Vance, who graduated from Ohio State in 2009 with a degree in philosophy and political science, welcomed the team alongside President Trump. The Buckeyes presented both with custom helmets and jerseys, adding a personal touch to their White House victory lap.As the U.S. Marine Band played “We Are the Champions,” the spirit of celebration never wavered — even if the trophy didn’t stay in one piece. The gaffe may have been unexpected, but it underscored JD Vance’s light-hearted persona, making the Vice President’s trophy fumble a uniquely memorable highlight of an already historic day.Also Read: “Coming soon”: With wedding bells in the air, Hailee Steinfeld’s cryptic post has fans guessing what's next","Vice President JD Vance accidentally dropped the College Football Playoff’s national championship trophy in front of a crowd that included the team, President Donald Trump, and members of the media.

Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) were cruising in their run-chase before Yuzvendra Chahal turned the game on its head with four quick wickets.

Chahal trapped Rahane, who didn't take the review and walked back. If Rahane had gone to the third umpire, he would have survived, as the impact was outside the off-stump.""I will take the blame as the captain of the team. I played the wrong shot; it was missing, but still, I will take the blame. Angkrish Raghuvanshi was not very sure; he said probably it could be umpire's call. I wasn't sure as well, and that was the discussion,"" Rahane said at the post-match presentation.In his next over, Chahal, who is battling a shoulder injury , got the wicket of the set batter, Angkrish Raghuvanshi.""What about Chahal? Simply outstanding. He had a fitness test before this game, with a shoulder injury he picked up in the previous game. I had a chat with him, and he told me, 'coach, I am absolutely fine,'"" said coach Ricky Ponting Chahal was on a hat-trick in his third over as he dismissed Rinku Singh and Ramandeep Singh.However, his spell was somewhat spoilt by Andre Russell , who hit two sixes and one boundary in his last over. Chahal finished with magical bowling figures of 4 for 28.Earlier, Punjab Kings were bowled out for a mere 111 in 15.3 overs. Skipper Shreyas Iyer's (0) early dismissal sparked the collapse after PBKS's bright start, which saw their openers Priyansh Arya (22) and Prabhsimran Singh (30) adding 39 runs in 3.1 overs.For KKR, India pacer Harshit Rana took 3/25, Varun Chakravarthy claimed 2/21, and Sunil Narine bagged 2/14.",Punjab Kings beat Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) by 16 runs.

""Nothing to express. We all saw what happened there.""

When we were batting, sweep was very hard to play. Let the ball come and then take your chances. Play cricketing shots and keep that intent going. We were a bit reckless and we need to take full responsibility as a batting unit,"" said Rahane.""Too many things going in my head. It's too early. It was an easy chase for us.

In just a handful of international matches — 2 ODIs and 7 T20Is — he has already notched up 19 wickets, including two four-wicket hauls in the 50-over format.Punjab Kings secured Bartlett for Rs 80 lakh in the IPL 2025 mega auction in Jeddah.","Xavier Bartlett made his IPL debut for Punjab Kings against Kolkata Knight Riders.

How Phillies’ Trea Turner helped Bryce Harper

“Pretty cool, pretty special day.”

“I was confused at first, but I think he wanted to share that moment with us, I think it was pretty cool. He’s a pretty creative guy. He let us know in our team meeting. He kind of wanted to share the moment with everybody. He was nice enough to ask me to do it. I thought it was a nice moment for him and his family. I think they were all watching here from up top.”

“I got a text message with the gender; I messed with him a little bit in the dugout. I picked up the pink one and swung it around a little bit. He thought he was having a girl, so I had to mess with him a little bit. Sure enough, it was a boy. I ended up handing him the blue one, and he was pretty happy.”

Trea Turner shares banter with Bryce Harper over gender reveal

“Like I said, he thought he was having a girl, so when I was messing with him, he was like, ‘I knew it was a girl.’ Then, I handed him the blue one. I said, ‘You’re not going to need that pink one.’ He was just excited. I think he would have been excited either way, but now, he’s got two of each. Kind of a complete family already, but like I said, anytime you can add another person to the family, I think it’s special. I think he was super excited.”

Why Jonathan Kuminga was benched for the LA Clippers game as well

head coachhas sparked debate after benchingin a crucial game against the Los Angeles Clippers. The Warriors lost 124-119, missing a chance to secure a better playoff position, and fans are questioning Kerr’s decision to leave the young forward out entirely.Steve Kerr defended his choice, saying he played the lineup he felt most comfortable with, and Kuminga wasn’t part of it. The decision raised eyebrows, especially with the Warriors facing another must-win game against the Memphis Grizzlies for the seventh seed in the Western Conference.Now, with the playoffs on the line, all eyes are on whether Kuminga will see the court this time. But Kerr isn’t giving any hints.Before the Grizzlies matchup, Kerr declined to answer whether he spoke with Jonathan Kuminga about his future role. His silence speaks volumes, especially given his history with the 22-year-old.Kerr has been known to challenge Kuminga, and opinions are split among fans. Some believe the coach is stifling the forward’s growth, while others think the tough approach will benefit him long-term.Sitting Kuminga in high-stakes games has led to speculation about his place on the team. But if the Golden State Warriors plan a deep playoff run, they’ll need every available player to contribute—meaning Kuminga could still have a role to play.For now, Kerr’s decisions remain under scrutiny, and fans will be watching closely to see if Kuminga gets his chance when it matters most.Coach Steve Kerr opted not to play Jonathan Kuminga in their must-win game against the Los Angeles Clippers , a decision that contributed to their overtime loss and Play-In Tournament fate. After the game, Kerr explained that he went with a rotation he felt more comfortable with, including Gary Payton II over Kuminga.Kerr acknowledged Kuminga’s impact this season but emphasized lineup fit as the deciding factor. “The lineup with Jimmy [Butler], Draymond [Green], and JK doesn’t work—we need spacing,” he said.

DC aim to bounce back against RR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/dc-aim-to-bounce-back-against-rr/articleshow/120329603.cms,"DC VS RR

Use of saliva and second ball rule has helped: Mohit

NEW DELHI: After two indifferent seasons, Delhi Capitals have been a force to reckon with in IPL-2025, showcasing a blend of youthful exuberance and seasoned expertise. Under the astute captaincy of Axar Patel , DC have won four of their first five matches.The recent 12-run defeat against Mumbai Indians, however, exposed some of DC’s vulnerabilities, particularly their batting depth. Despite Karun Nair ’s valiant 89, the loss highlighted the need for better game management. DC will be eager to bounce back on home turf, where they have a strong record, having won four out of five last year.There are fewer causes for concern for DC this season, but opener Jake Fraser McGurk ’s form is one of them. In five matches, he has managed only 46 runs at 9.2 (SR 100), a significant drop from the explosive season he enjoyed last year. Despite the management’s continued faith in the young opener, his time may be running out. Fraser-McGurk’s opening partner Faf du Plessis is likely still recovering from an unspecified injury, so DC may stick with the same playing XI they fielded against Mumbai Indians, with Mukesh Kumar coming in as ‘Impact Player’. Rajasthan Royals , on the other hand, have had a mixed campaign. After a sluggish start, RR showed signs of recovery but then lost two games on the trot. With two wins from the six games they’ve played, the Royals are desperate to find consistency. Their batting has relied heavily on Yashasvi Jaiswal and Riyan Parag, while their bowling has been spearheaded by Jofra Archer and Wanindu Hasaranga, both of whom have blown hot and cold.DC pacer Mohit Sharma believes allowing the use of saliva to shine the ball and the newly introduced “second ball rule” have provided bowlers with much-needed relief. “Saliva has made a big difference. In about 70% matches, the ball is tailing in, and that’s only because saliva adds more weight to the ball,” he said, adding: “The second ball rule is 100% helpful. We saw the impact in the last game.”Likely XIIs: DC: Jake FraserMcGurk, Abishek Porel, Karun Nair, KL Rahul (wk), Axar Patel (C), Tristan Stubbs, Ashutosh Sharma, Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Mukesh Kumar/Faf du Plessis.RR: Sanju Samson (C, wk), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Nitish Rana, Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel, Shimron Hetmyer, Wanindu Hasaranga, Jofra Archer, Maheesh Theekshana, Tushar Deshpande, Sandeep Sharma, Kumar Kartikeya/Shubham Dubey.","Use of saliva and second ball rule has helped: Mohit Sharma.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

HOW HOCKEY HELPED TRISTIAN STUBBS

NEW DELHI: If Tristan Stubbs wasn’t sending bowlers into the stands with his brute power, the 24-year-old might have been executing push passes, flicks, or drag flicks on the hockey turf. Had he not chosen cricket, Stubbs would likely have pursued a career in hockey - following in his father’s footsteps.Tristan’s father Chris Stubbs was a well-known name in South Africa’s hockey circuit. A former provincial player, Chris never got the chance to represent the national team. Despite that, he never discouraged his son from choosing cricket over hockey.In fact, Tristan began his sporting journey with hockey, but the allure of fame and financial stability eventually became key reasons for Chris to guide him towards the gentleman’s game. Having experienced the struggles and limitations of a hockey career firsthand, Chris didn’t want his son to face the same hurdles.Tristan grew up watching his father dominate with a hockey stick, and naturally picked up the sport. But over time, Chris gradually nudged him towards cricket — a move that would shape his future.""There's no money in hockey. Hockey is hard work and it's fun, but it's not a career,"" said Chris, who was watching his son practice from the stands ahead of the Delhi Capitals vs Rajasthan Royals clash at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, in an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com. Tristian plays for Delhi Capitals in the IPL 2025 .Chris still regrets not making it to the senior national team, but one milestone he proudly checked off was playing against India.""I played provincial hockey, but I wasn't good enough to play for South Africa. One of my biggest games was against India. They came to South Africa in the '90s, when they first came back — when we came out of isolation in '92. I played for Southern Transvaal and played against India. Southern Transvaal were quite a good team in South Africa. It was a warm-up game. And then, when they came on their tour to play against South Africa, they played a warm-up game. They played a game against Southern Transvaal.""India crushed us 5-0,"" Chris said with a big laugh.The dream of representing his country remained unfulfilled for Chris, but he hoped his son Tristan would go further — wearing the national jersey with the country’s flag proudly on his chest.Chris wanted his son to begin his journey with hockey — to build strength, timing, and ball control — and then channel that same brute power and hand-eye coordination into cricket.And that’s exactly what Tristan is doing now. He’s become a nightmare for bowlers across the globe.Stubbs walks in, picks the length in a flash, and sends the ball soaring into the stands. Pulls, sweeps, reverse sweeps, scoops, paddle sweeps, straight drives — you name it, they’re all in his arsenal.""Obviously, he always wanted to play cricket. Hockey was never really a thing. He played hockey because he loved it, but he loved cricket as well. So he wanted to, you know, basically go to university to try and play cricket — to try and play provincial cricket — and that was his main aim: to play cricket. Hockey was just to keep fit and have fun. He enjoyed hockey, and he was good at it, but he really wanted to play cricket from an early age,"" Chris said.""Playing both hockey and cricket helped him a lot. Some of his sweep shots clearly came from his reverse sticks. His reverse shots come from hockey. He was always on the side of the field when we played, and he grew up with a hockey stick in one hand and a ball in the other — he always had a ball in his hand,"" Chris added.","Tristan Stubbs grew up watching his father dominate with a hockey stick, and naturally picked up the sport.

CHENNAI: With the Federation Cup just a few days away, several high-profile athletes chose not to push themselves at the Indian Open here on Tuesday. Some events at the Indian Open witnessed upsets, while others were marred by injuries. Jeswin Aldrin , competing for the first time since the Paris Olympics, managed only one valid attempt and finished seventh with a best effort of 7.36m in men’s long jump. The 24-year-old struggled to adapt to the hot conditions and pulled his hamstring during the warm-up, just minutes before the competition.The national-record holder was unable to adjust to the heat quickly enough. Up-and-coming athlete Aditya Singh clinched the top spot with a best jump of 7.74m. He was the only Indian athlete to cross the 8m mark last year and has started this season on a bright note.“I was not happy with the way I ran in the runway. Had my approach been better, I could have jumped close to my best, even crossed the Asian Championships mark (8.07m),” Aditya said. The 23-year-old Aditya, who started his career as a long jumper in 2016, returned to the event in 2022 after a brief sojourn with sprinting.Shot putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor secured the top spot, recording 17.61m. The Olympian registered only one legal throw, commit- ting two fouls and opting not to attempt his final three chances. Tajinderpal was competing due to the AFI’s guideline of participation in at least one domestic meet be- fore the Federation Cup.Vithya Ramraj earned gold in women’s 400m hurdles with a sub-par timing of 56.90s, while R Anu (57.52s) gave a tough fight and bagged a silver",Long jumper Jeswin Aldrin pulled his hamstring during warm-up.

Yuzvendra Chahal was the star of the night, returning figures of 4 for 28, including the key scalps of Angkrish Raghuvanshi (37), Rinku Singh, Ramandeep Singh, and KKR captain Ajinkya Rahane.The collapse began early, with Marco Jansen (3/17) and debutant Xavier Bartlett (1/30) striking in the first two overs to remove openers Sunil Narine and Quinton de Kock.Although a 55-run stand between Rahane and Raghuvanshi briefly steadied the chase, Chahal’s double-strike opened the floodgates.Andre Russell (17) threatened late with two sixes in an over off Chahal, but Jansen bowled him to seal Punjab’s historic victory.*excludes rain-affected games",Punjab Kings beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 16 runs.

Chennai Super Kings:

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings snapped their five-match losing streak in the Indian Premier League 2025 with a much-needed five-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants at the Ekana Stadium on Monday. Despite the morale-boosting result, CSK remain at the bottom of the points table with just four points from seven matches.Opting to bowl first, CSK restricted LSG to 166 for 7, thanks to disciplined efforts from their bowlers. Rishabh Pant led the way for Lucknow with a fighting 63 off 49 balls, including four fours and four sixes, while Mitchell Marsh contributed 30 off 25 balls at the top.Ravindra Jadeja starred with the ball, picking up 2 for 24 in three overs, while seamers Khaleel Ahmed and Anshul Kamboj chipped in with early breakthroughs.In reply, CSK were wobbling at 111 for 5 after a solid start from Rachin Ravindra (37 off 22). But Shivam Dube held his nerve with a patient 43* off 37 balls. He found a perfect ally in MS Dhoni, who turned back the clock with a blistering 26* off 11 deliveries, sealing the win with three balls to spare. The two added a match-winning 57-run partnership in 4.3 overs.Youngster Shaik Rasheed also made an impression on debut with a handy 27 off 19 balls, providing CSK some middle-order stability.This win, while important for CSK’s confidence, does little to change their position at the foot of the table. Lucknow Super Giants, despite the loss, remain fourth with 8 points from seven matches and are still in the playoff mix.166/7 in 20 overs (Rishabh Pant 63; Ravindra Jadeja 2/24).168/5 in 19.3 overs (Rachin Ravindra 37, MS Dhoni 26 not out, Shivam Dube 43 not out; Ravi Bishnoi 2/18).",Chennai Super Kings beat Lucknow Super Giants by five wickets.

IPL: RCB mentor Karthik questions Chinnaswamy pitch after twin defeats

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals are set to host Mumbai Indians in their IPL 2025 clash at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday. The Hardik Pandya-led Mumbai Indians have already arrived in the capital and are currently training in the city.However, their preparations were affected as Delhi and surrounding NCR regions experienced a sudden dip in temperature on Friday, accompanied by dusty storms for the second consecutive day. The weather disrupted flight operations at the Delhi airport, leading to multiple delays and diversions — and even impacted Mumbai Indians’ practice session.In a video shared by the Mumbai Indians on their social media platforms, star batter Rohit Sharma is seen reacting humorously to the incoming storm. As strong winds hit the stadium, Rohit can be heard shouting “comeback” to his teammates. He then playfully tells the cameraman to focus on the storm instead of him.(Hey, why are you filming me? Shoot the storm instead),"" Rohit says in the clip.Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for Delhi on April 11, with temperatures expected to range between 23°C and 38°C.While the storms caused disruption, the overcast skies and cooler winds brought a brief respite from the heatwave that had gripped the region over the past week.Delhi Capitals remain the only unbeaten side in the tournament so far with four wins from four matches.Mumbai Indians, on the other hand, are struggling at the bottom half of the table — placed eighth with just one win and four defeats in five games.","Delhi Capitals host Mumbai Indians in their IPL 2025 clash on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings suffered a major setback as regular skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad was ruled out of the IPL due to an elbow injury — a development that has paved the way for Mahendra Singh Dhoni to return to the leadership role. CSK head coach Stephen Fleming confirmed the news on Thursday. Gaikwad sustained the injury after being struck by a short ball from Jofra Archer during CSK’s IPL 2025 clash against Rajasthan Royals."" Ruturaj Gaikwad ruled out of IPL with fracture on elbow.

We got an X-ray, which was inconclusive, and we had an MRI, which revealed a fracture in his elbow, in the radial neck. So we’re disappointed and feel for him. We appreciate the efforts that he’s gone to in terms of trying to play, but unfortunately, he’d be out of the tournament from now. We have an uncapped player, MS Dhoni, who will take over as captain for the remainder of the IPL,"" Fleming added at a press conference.Dhoni, who came out for the toss for CSK, also confirmed that Gaikwad was ruled out of the season. He made two changes to the Playing XI, bringing in Rahul Tripathi in place of Gaikwad and including Anshul Kamboj for Mukesh Choudhary.""We were looking to bat first. Quite a few occasions where we tried to chase it down and what we realised is that the wicket slows down a bit, so if you don't get a good start then the middle order comes under pressure.

So yeah, he will be a big miss,"" Dhoni said during the toss.""(On the importance of winning this game) It is important now, every game is important. We have lost too many matches and now it is important to do the basics right - have dot balls, take our catches. A couple of games we lost by big margins, but otherwise it was about the small things - about one over going for 20 runs. Our batters are more authentic as batters, they won't slog everything.

IPL record

Marco Jansen and Shreyas Iyer

IPL Points Table

Proving once again that lowscoring T20 games can be gripping, the Punjab Kings (PBKS) bounced back gallantly after being shot out for a paltry 111 in 15.3 overs at the Mullanpur Stadium on Tuesday. Punjab then dismissed Kolkata Knight Riders for a mere 95 in return, in 15.1 overs.The result was a sensational 16-run win that sets a new record for the lowest total defended in IPL history . The heroes of PBKS’ stunning win were legspinner Yuzvendra Chahal (4/28 in 4 overs) and South African leftarm pacer Marco Jansen (3/17 in 3.1 overs). Though no longer in Team India’s setup, Chahal served a stern reminder to the national selectors, showcasing his immense skill and temperament yet again.The 34-yearold removed KKR skipper Ajinkya Rahane, top-scorer Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Rinku Singh and Ramandeep Singh in a magical spell that completely turned the game. From a strong 72/3 in the 10th over, KKR collapsed catastrophically, losing seven wickets for just 23 runs in 36 balls. The defending champions were rattled. A desperate Andre Russell momentarily sparked hope, smashing Chahal for two sixes and a four in the 14th over. But the West Indian’s nightmare continued when he inside-edged a pull off Jansen onto his stumps to seal KKR’s fate.Ironically, in their previous match, Punjab had posted a mammoth 245/6 only to lose to Sunrisers Hyderabad in Hyderabad. Earlier, KKR’s bowlers, led by India pacer Harshit Rana (3/25 in 3 overs), had shot out PBKS for a paltry 111. The Punjab top-order collapsed after a brisk 39-run start in 20 balls by Priyansh Arya (22 off 12) and Prabhsimran Singh (30 off 15). They crumbled to 86/8 in 11 overs before Shashank Singh and Bartlett added a crucial 23 off 25 balls for the ninth wicket.All three top PBKS wickets claimed by Rana were caught by Ramandeep Singh, playing on his home turf, a unique feat in itself. Skipper Shreyas Iyer , facing his former team — which he led to the title last year — fell for a two-ball duck. His previous outing had seen him score a sparkling 82 off 36. KKR’s spinners then took over. Varun Chakravarthy (2/21) and Sunil Narine (2/14) applied pressure.Narine also broke an IPL record by taking his 36th wicket against PBKS, the most by any bowler against a single franchise in the tournament. PBKS’s Aussie recruits, Josh Inglis (2) and Glenn Maxwell (7), again failed with the bat. Maxwell’s horror run continues — 41 runs in six matches @ 8.20 — though he did take the wicket of Venkatesh Iyer (7). Shashank Singh was dismissed LBW for 18, while Suryansh Shedge, brought in as an ‘Impact Sub’, edged behind while trying to cut Narine, missing a golden chance to impress.",Punjab Kings beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 16 runs.

After a dream start to their IPL 2025 campaign, Delhi Capitals were jolted by a dramatic home defeat against Mumbai Indians. Riding a four-match winning streak, the Axar Patel-led side looked unstoppable until a shocking collapse derailed their 206-run chase on Sunday. Despite Karun Nair ’s scintillating 89, DC crumbled from 119/1 to 193 all out, slipping to second on the points table.They now face a faltering Rajasthan Royals side, who sit eighth with just two wins in six games. The Royals have battled inconsistency all season, with their batting unit misfiring despite flashes of brilliance from Yashasvi Jaiswal and Riyan Parag.Delhi’s spin duo — Kuldeep Yadav and youngster Vipraj Nigam — will again be central to their plans, having regularly outfoxed opposition batters. However, Axar Patel ’s personal form remains a concern. The all-rounder is yet to pick a wicket in six games and has had little impact with the bat.With Faf du Plessis still injured, Nair's return strengthens a middle order that includes KL Rahul, Tristan Stubbs, and Ashutosh Sharma. In contrast, the Royals’ bowling lacked bite, with Jofra Archer only just finding rhythm and most others struggling for control.In a clash of redemption, Delhi will aim to reset their title charge, while Rajasthan desperately seek stability.The square boundaries measure 60m and 66m, with a 72m hit straight down the ground. This is a high-scoring venue, with 235 being the highest total recorded here. The pitch has straw-colored grass and visible cracks — it's not as flat as usual, but that’s unlikely to impact run-scoring much.
