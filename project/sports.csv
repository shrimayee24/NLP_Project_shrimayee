MUMBAI: Two years ago, jockey Nirmal Jodha was fighting for his life. On Sunday, he was fighting for the finish line. He won both races.The 43-year-old, who battled third-stage colon cancer and dropped to just 27 kg during treatment, made a stunning comeback at Mahalaxmi Racecourse , guiding no-hoper Absolute Gorgeous past the winning post at The Star Shine Trophy .""Though I have ridden around 300 winners in my 25-year career in the saddle, this one was the sweetest of them all,"" Jodha told TOI.In Jan 2023, Jodha was diagnosed with third-stage colon cancer. ""I had been experiencing digestive discomfort for some time, and a routine clinic visit revealed an ulcer in my large intestine,"" he recalled. A biopsy confirmed it was third-stage colon cancer. ""I was completely blank. My first thought was - what will happen to my widowed mother, my wife and my three-year-old son? How will they survive if I die?""Jockeys’ Association of India and fellow riders helped him get in touch with Dr Mehli Nazir, who advised immediate admission to Ruby Hall Clinic in Pune. There, Dr Gajanan Kanitkar performed surgery in Feb 2023.What followed was a gruelling battle — aggressive chemotherapy and radiation in the months ahead brought his weight down to just 27 kg. Fortunately, his years as a jockey had trained him to handle a strict diet. A jockey’s typical weight ranges between 47kg and 55kg.Trainer Adhirajsingh Jodha, Nirmal’s employer and one of the leading names at Royal Western India Turf Club, played a crucial role in his comeback. “I asked him to keep coming to the stables just to get him out of the house and take his mind off things,” Adhirajsingh said. “At first, he just hung around, but soon, he asked for work.” By early last year, Nirmal was back at the stables. “He was so thin and weak that I only let him trot my horses — to help him regain confidence, ” Adhirajsingh said. But by the end of the Pune season in Oct, Nirmal had progressed to cantering horses.Early this Mumbai season — which runs from mid-Nov to mid-April — he secured a few rides that strengthened his resolve. Trainer P S Chouhan then entrusted him with Absolute Gorgeous. “I told him to take a good jump and do his best in the homestretch,” Chouhan said. Nirmal did not disappoint. While he’s back in the saddle, his medical journey isn’t over. “I have to go for periodic checkups to monitor for recurrence,” he said. “I’ll be on medication for the next five years.”","Two years ago, jockey Nirmal Jodha was fighting for his life.

“I would like to play”: Deion Sanders champions Colorado’s Spring Game as other programs abandon tradition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/i-would-like-to-play-deion-sanders-champions-colorados-spring-game-as-other-programs-abandon-tradition/articleshow/119215839.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

Colorado’s Spring Game set for April 19, nationally broadcast

Deion Sanders wants more than just a scrimmage



As many major college football programs move away from traditional spring games, Deion Sanders is taking a different approach at Colorado. While powerhouse programs like Texas, USC, and Nebraska have canceled their 2025 spring games, Sanders is doubling down on the importance of the annual showcase, ensuring that Colorado’s will not only take place but also receive national television coverage.Unlike Texas coach Steve Sarkisian, who prefers an NFL-style spring practice, and Nebraska’s Matt Rhule, who sees spring games as an opportunity for rival coaches to scout players in the transfer portal era, Sanders is keeping the event alive in Boulder.Colorado’s 2025 spring game is set for April 19 at Folsom Field and will air on ESPN2, ensuring the Buffaloes remain in the national spotlight. This marks the second time in three years that Colorado’s spring game will be nationally televised. The 2023 edition, Sanders’ first as head coach, was the only spring game that aired on ESPN’s main network, drawing an impressive 551,000 viewers.In true Coach Prime fashion, Deion Sanders isn’t just content with keeping the spring game alive—he wants to take it a step further by introducing a competitive element.""We got to sell this thing out and pack this thing, because the way the trend is going, you never know if this is going to be the last spring game,"" Sanders said at a press conference. ""I don’t believe in that, and I don’t really want to condone that, and I would like to play—I actually would like to play against another team this spring, that’s what I’m trying to do.""Syracuse head coach Fran Brown responded on Twitter, expressing interest in making Sanders’ vision a reality. However, current NCAA rules prohibit teams from playing against one another in the spring.Despite this restriction, Sanders remains focused on pushing for change. “I would like to style it like the pros,” he said. “I would like to practice against someone for a few days, and then you have the spring game. I think the public will be satisfied with that tremendously.”Under Sanders’ leadership, fan engagement in Colorado football has skyrocketed. In 2023, Colorado sold out its spring game for the first time, drawing more than 47,000 fans—an astonishing leap from the 1,100 fans who attended in 2022. Last year, the Buffaloes saw an estimated 28,000 fans attend, further solidifying the growing excitement around the program.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers could retire if his preferred NFL team doesn’t come forward with an offer: How it will impact the QB market As other schools move away from spring games, Sanders is not just keeping the tradition alive—he’s looking to elevate it. Whether or not the NCAA will allow teams to scrimmage against each other in the future remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Coach Prime is determined to keep Colorado in the national conversation.","Colorado’s 2025 spring game is set for April 19 at Folsom Field and will air on ESPN2.

Kelce Brothers keep fans entertained with their signature humor on New Heights Podcast

Jason Sudeikis on Future of Ted Lasso, Scoring on LeBron, Behind the Scenes at SNL50 & More | Ep 129

Popular NFL player brothers Travis and Jason Kelce have turned their New Heights podcast into a sports fan favorite where they mix professional commentary with their famous sense of humor. The brothers on the show typically discuss football at length but the latest episode shifted to discuss astrology before turning into friendly argumentation between them.During the Heights Hotline segment, a fan asked if the Kelce brothers believed in astrology or had ever had their zodiac signs read. Jason Kelce, known for his no-nonsense approach, quickly shut down the idea, responding bluntly, ""This will be a short one—no!"" His younger brother Travis, however, appeared more curious about the topic—though he initially confused astrology with astronomy, much to Jason’s amusement.After a brief moment of clarification, Jason made his stance on astrology crystal clear. He dismissed it as a set of “generalities” that could apply to anyone, questioning the legitimacy of zodiac traits.Travis, on the other hand, took the opportunity to humorously apply astrology to his brother’s personality. When Jason revealed that he is a Scorpio, Travis didn’t hesitate to tease him. ""Yeah, you’re a mean person,"" he quipped, leading Jason to surprisingly agree: ""I think that kind of tracks, actually.""While their back-and-forth had fans laughing, neither Kelce brother ultimately claimed to be a firm believer in zodiac signs. Jason went on to explain that horoscopes tend to be vague, making it easy for people to see themselves in any description. ""I think anybody could be all of them,"" Jason stated. ""That’s why it works.""As the debate wrapped up, the brothers shifted to a subject they could both agree on—astronomy. Travis enthusiastically declared, ""Big on astronomy,"" before the two attempted (and struggled) to recall the correct order of the planets, sparking another round of laughter.Also Read: “It’s a very painful disease”: Donna Kelce raises awareness for Shingles while supporting health advocacy The Kelce brothers managed to maintain their spot at the top of podcast charts despite not convincing listeners about astrology because they produced more of their beloved comedy routines along with their signature brotherly humor.

“Gafford doesn’t receive enough praise for his stable play on both ends,”

The Los Angeles Lakers are reportedly considering a bold move to bolster their frontcourt by trading star rookie Dalton Knecht for Dallas Mavericks ’ center Daniel Gafford. This potential trade, as suggested by Bleacher Report’s Eric Pincus , could address the Lakers’ ongoing struggles in the low post.Despite commendable efforts from Alex Len and Jaxson Hayes, the Los Angeles Lakers’ frontcourt has shown noticeable limitations this season. Gafford, an underrated but impactful player, could provide the stability and energy the team desperately needs. This season, the 26-year-old big man has been a reliable player for the Mavericks, shooting an amazing 69.9% from the floor and averaging 12.3 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 1.9 blocks per game.The move is made more questionable by Daniel Gafford's recent knee injury, which could keep him out for the rest of the 2024–25 season. His contributions to the Mavericks' march to the NBA Finals the previous season cannot be understated, albeit this setback. Gafford shot 63.4% from the floor and averaged 9.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks per game in 22 postseason games. Dallas' success was largely attributed to his rim-running prowess, defensive presence, and contagious intensity.Pincus noted. While he may not be the most skilled center in the league, his reliability and hustle make him a valuable asset for any team.For the Los Angeles Lakers, trading Knecht, a promising rookie, for Daniel Gafford represents a calculated risk. Knecht has shown flashes of potential, but the Lakers seem willing to part with him to address their immediate needs. Daniel Gafford’s $40 million contract, while significant, could be a worthwhile investment if he returns to full health and replicates his previous form.This potential trade could reshape both teams’ rosters. The Mavericks would gain a young talent in Knecht, while the Los Angeles Lakers would acquire a proven big man to strengthen their frontcourt.

KOLKATA: From being almost unsold to assuming the defending champions’ captaincy, Ajinkya Rahane ’s leap has been of more than just faith. Even though Kolkata Knight Riders would have felt they hit a jackpot when Rahane ended up as the best player in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 (SMAT) tournament, the veteran might have been more relieved than happy.One of the few players who have remained in the IPL since its inception, he almost missed the bus this time. If the IPL auction provided him a lifeline, SMAT gave him a new lease of life. Having accumulated 432 runs at a strike rate of almost 170, the batter who had gathered the red-ball tag like moss on decaying wood, had once again established his T20 credentials.Less than a month prior to that, KKR had pouched Rahane for his base price of Rs 1.5 crore, that too on a second calling. With Shreyas Iyer gone to Punjab Kings, KKR were perhaps hunting for a captain when the unsold Rahane was brought back under the hammer.The 36-year-old Rahane will also be expected to groom Venkatesh Iyer, six years younger and Rs 22.25 crore costlier, for his shoes. So far, Rahane and Iyer have shared the spotlight almost equally.“Have nothing to prove” and “Living in the moment” have been Rahane’s take since he accepted the KKR captaincy, but that cannot take away the hurt he would have endured when Rajasthan Royals removed him from the post middway in 2019. Rahane exuded confidence at a KKR event on Wednesday, when the team was introduced to the fans in a grand manner.“Great to be back, an honour to lead,” the skipper said, typically in a few words. “We have prepared well, and I am happy that everyone (in the team) is on the same page.”Head coach Chandrakant Pandit echoed Rahane’s sentiment. “It was a special moment to win the trophy (last year),” he said.Having been overshadowed by Gautam Gambhir last year, the coach is looking ahead to a new season, with some help from mentor Dwyane Bravo. The West Indian in his inimitable way, endorsed Rahane, saying that KKR is ready for another campaign.“KKR know how to win a championship, now the idea is to defend one,” said Bravo.Rahane has led 25 times in IPL, 23 of them being with the Royals, although his captaincy record in this tournament is not too flattering, having won only nine games. But the big question remains. Is batter Rahane’s place in the playing XI guaranteed? The issue is up in the air, but as long as he lets his bat do the talking, Rahane will be there. If not, Iyer is always there.","Kolkata Knight Riders captain Ajinkya Rahane won Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament. The 36-year-old was almost unsold at the IPL auction.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

BENGALURU: In March 2008, Royal Challengers Bangalore ( RCB ) cashed in on Delhi Daredevils’ lack of interest in signing Virat Kohli for the opening Indian Premier League . Seventeen seasons on, it’s still Delhi’s loss and Bengaluru’s gain. Perhaps, Delhi could be forgiven for the oversight.Teenager Kohli was explosive batting prowess, but all raw emotion. That hasn’t changed as the IPL enters its 18th edition this weekend. However, in the intervening period, the now 36-year-old has gone from unabashed teen to cricket great.Kohli has led the Indian teams across formats and RCB for several seasons. He is only the third player after Sachin Tendulkar and Jasprit Bumrah (both Mumbai Indians) to play for a single franchise. He insists RCB will be his only IPL team.Age and experience have failed to dim Kohli’s hunger. His appetite for excellence and success has not wavered. Kohli, at a RCB summit recently, said his emotions have sobered while his competitive spirit still bubbles.“Things are happening naturally with me; it’s getting tapered down. My competitiveness has not waned. A lot of people find it very difficult to process how competitiveness remains at the same level if the aggression does not. You can still be aggressive in your mind, but you don’t need to express it every now and then out of frustration, which I have,” he strove to explain.And while the batting star has nothing left to prove, one aspect would rankle: The lack of an IPL trophy in his chest of spoils. RCB have made it to the final thrice, yet the trophy has eluded them.This year, Kohli will play under captain Rajat Patidar. At a time when he was expected to lead himself, Kohli has thrown his weight behind Patidar. AB de Villiers, RCB’s lynchpin with Kohli till not long ago, believes Kohli’s leadership, sans the captaincy title, is crucial for this season.“All Virat needs to do is what he’s been doing for years: Control the game,” he told JioHotstar. “He should be the ‘captain of the batting department’ title this season.""",Virat Kohli will play for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 18th edition of the Indian Premier League.

The IPL is the engine that drives India’s might in world cricket. Over the last 17 years, it has generated mind-numbing revenues besides being a talent-spinning tool in Indian cricket. Yet, it’s hard to dismiss the franchise-vs-country debate every time the IPL season comes around. Jasprit Bumrah ’s half-walk-half-hop run-up and Mohammed Shami ’s smooth approach towards the bowling crease may be a pulsating viewing experience, but there’s persisting apprehension over their fitness.India’s Test cricket is at a crossroads currently. With a five-Test tour scheduled to start 25 days after the IPL final, all eyes will be on Bumrah, Shami and other prospective pacers over the next two months. The window would have been shorter had India qualified for the World Test Championship (WTC) final.First things first. Bumrah is yet to obtain a fitness certificate from BCCI medical team at the Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru. He hasn’t taken the field for India since he was forced out due to injury in the first innings of Sydney Test in the first week of Jan.Shami appears to have regained some rhythm during the victorious Champions Trophy campaign after having missed 14 months of cricket.There’s unease in BCCI over how the medical team has dealt with injuries in the last few years. The board is in process of overhauling its medical team once incumbent head Nitin Patel finishes his notice period this month. The concern is the medical team has been reluctant to be accountable while declaring a player’s fitness. It’s often left to selectors who are just told that the player is clinically fit. Whether the player is match-fit is not known.‘Workload management’ has been the catchphrase in Indian cricket in the last decade. Yet, the IPL becomes an exception when the players walk into their franchises. The franchises dole out huge money for two months of service. There’s very little wiggle room once the BCCI clears the players from its CoE (formerly the National Cricket Academy).It’s not just about Bumrah who is expected to start his IPL campaign for Mumbai Indians in the second week of April. There’s Akash Deep, who too is undergoing rehab at the CoE. Harshit Rana, identified as India’s next frontline pacer, has endured a long season going into the IPL.The core focus of workload management has revolved around injury management in the last three years. But the results of treating recurrent injuries have not been inspiring enough.When it comes to the IPL, BCCI’s role ends once they give all-clear to a player who had earlier reported with an injury. The franchise’s in-house medical team takes over once the players get into an IPL season. The question is, does BCCI lose all rights over the players? Not really.The introduction of standardised workload management SOPs and wearable devices keep providing all the data. The contracted BCCI players are given Athlete Management System (AMS) vests and the whoop bands (which are worn as watches on the wrists). These devices offer enough data about their physical activities, recovery and sleep cycle. The BCCI trusts its players.Bumrah, per se, has been through all kinds of rehab and training routines. BCCI’s medical team devises personalised routines according to data of a player. The players adhere to it and routines are usually shared with the franchise’ physios and strength and conditioning coaches.Sources close to India’s team management and selectors say they trust the judgement of a player whenever the player feels any kind of discomfort.“The players, especially the bowlers, are well educated. They understand what’s at stake for them. One has to go by the player’s instinct,” a BCCI source told TOI.For all the talk about whether a player of Bumrah’s stature should put his body through the thankless schedule of the IPL, the bottom line says it’s the BCCI medical team’s responsibility to ensure a player is always available to play if he is not injured.",Jasprit Bumrah is yet to obtain a fitness certificate from BCCI medical team at the Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru. He hasn’t taken the field for India since he was forced out due to injury in the first innings of Sydney Test in first week of Jan. Shami appears to have regained some rhythm during the victorious Champions Trophy campaign after having missed 14 months of cricket.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119236327,imgsize-58630,width-400,resizemode-4/119236327.jpg"

As the IPL 2025 season approaches, the excitement isn’t just about the familiar superstars, it’s also about the fresh wave of Indian talent ready to set the stage on fire. Every season, the league brings to light new heroes, young cricketers who grab the spotlight with fearless batting, breathtaking spells, and game-changing performances. This year is no different.TOI picks the hopefuls who are primed to make their mark in the showpiece T20 extravaganza.Musheer, a 20-year-old all-rounder, joined Punjab Kings for Rs 30 lakh, bringing versatility to the table with his right-hand top-order batting and left-arm spin. The younger brother of Sarfaraz Khan, Musheer shot to limelight in the 2024 U-19 World Cup. He began his Ranji Trophy career with a bang, hitting a double-century for Mumbai last year. His T20 numbers are modest but growing. Punjab Kings, under new captain Shreyas Iyer and coach Ricky Ponting, aim to rebuild and Musheer’s adaptability could see him slot into the middle-order or serve as a fifth bowling option on spin-friendly pitches. His multiple skills make him a sleeper pick for IPL 2025, especially if PBKS lean on youth to turn their fortunes around.Known for his explosive batting style, Minz can change the course of a game within a few overs. The left-handed wicketkeeperbatsman was acquired by Mumbai Indians at the IPL 2025 auction at a steal deal of Rs 65 lakh. MI’s scouting network identified his potential early on, and the franchise is optimistic about his impact in the upcoming season. With Ishan Kishan not there in the MI set-up this time, Minz’ power game aligns with MI’s tradition of big hitters and can be a like-forlike replacement for Kishan. The 22-year-old has played just two first-class matches up till now, but his exploits in agegroup tournaments for Jharkhand have marked him as a player with a high ceiling.Andre Siddarth, 18, has made heads turn in the domestic circuit, earning high praise from several quarters. In a podcast, former India offspinner R Ashwin couldn’t stop gushing about Siddarth. His consistent performances in the Tamil Nadu Premier League caught the attention of CSK talent scouts who brought him into their fold. Under Ruturaj Gaikwad’s captaincy and MS Dhoni’s mentorship, Siddarth could thrive in CSK’s supportive environment. While he might not get immediate game time given CSK’s strong batting lineup, his domestic performances suggest he’s ready to step up if called upon. His knack for playing spin could see him thrive on Chepauk’s turning tracks.A dynamic batsman known for his quick-scoring ability, Rizvi is a potential match-winner for the Capitals. The 21-yearold’s breakthrough moment came during the Uttar Pradesh T20 League in 2023, where he made headlines by scoring an impressive 455 runs in just nine innings at a staggering strike-rate of 188.80. He hit 35 sixes and scored the fastest century (off just 47 balls) of the tournament. This remarkable form led to a fierce bidding war during the 2024 IPL auction, culminating in CSK securing his services for a substantial Rs 8.4 crore. Although his debut season saw limited success with only 51 runs in five innings, his potential remained undiminished. As he transitions to IPL 2025 with the Capitals after being acquired for Rs 95 lakh, Rizvi’s explosive batting style could see him play a crucial role for DC this season.A promising right-arm pacer and allrounder from Haryana, Kamboj was signed by CSK for Rs 3.40 crore during the IPL 2025 auction – a significant increase from his base price of Rs 20 lakh. Standing at 6 feet 2 inches, the 24-year-old can swing the new ball both ways. His height allows him to extract extra bounce from the pitch, posing a significant challenge for the batters. A historic moment came in Kamboj’s career came in Nov 2024, when he made headlines by becoming the third bowler in the history of Ranji Trophy to take all 10 wickets in an innings. He achieved the feat during Haryana’s match against Kerala in Rohtak registering figures of 10/49 in 30.1 overs. Additionally, his lower-order hitting ability adds depth to the batting lineup.The 13-year-old cricketing prodigy from Bihar took Indian cricket by storm when he was picked by Rajasthan Royals for Rs 1.10 crore at the IPL mega auction in Nov last year. Suryavanshi made headlines as the youngest player ever in IPL history, sparking both excitement and scepticism. His meteoric rise includes remarkable feats like a 58-ball century for India U-19 against Australia U-19, the fastest by an Indian in youth Tests, and a blistering 71 off 42 balls in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. Vaibhav’s journey began in Tajpur village, part of Samastipur district in Bihar, where his father Sanjeev, a farmer, nurtured his talent with backyard practice. By age 9, he joined a cricket academy in Samastipur, and at 12, he debuted in the Ranji Trophy, becoming the second youngest player to participate in the tournament. An attacking lefthanded batsman, Vaibhav’s inclusion could depend on injuries or tactical shifts, possibly as an Impact Player.","The IPL 2025 season kicks off on February 14 in Mumbai. ToI picks the young stars who are primed to make their mark in the showpiece T20 extravaganza. Musheer Khan, Robin Minz, Sameer Rizvi, Andre Siddarth, Anshul Kamboj, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Haryana Rana are among the hopefuls.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119236904,imgsize-60482,width-400,resizemode-4/119236904.jpg"

‘All players have to play in domestic tournaments’

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

'Nitin Patel's contract extended for 3 months'

MUMBAI: Even as India's senior players have hinted at their reservations against the SOPs in the policy towards their family on overseas tours, the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) remains firm that the newly-formulated policy will stay in place.In a conversation with TOI on Wednesday, BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia asserted that the Board policy is not something which had been suddenly introduced, but something which was always around.""This policy has not been formulated overnight as it was in place for the past couple of decades, dating back to the playing days of our president, Roger Binny and maybe earlier thereto. The new policy is an amendment of the earlier one with some additions relating to presence of players practice sessions , course of the match, tours ; luggage, unison in team movements and other ancillary activities with an objective to achieve team cohesion and unity. In fact, under the new policy, the BCCI has enhanced the duration of the period of stay of the family members with players during an overseas tour with a handle for relaxation of the norms under special circumstances, however, through a process,"" Saikia told this paper.""The policy applies uniformly to all members of the team — players, coaches, manager, support staff and everyone in the team— and has been notified and implemented considering everyone’s best interests. The BCCI acknowledges that there may be some resentment or difference of opinions, as in a democratic setup, people are entitled to express their views. At this stage, the current policy will remain intact without any change, as it is of paramount importance for the nation and our institution, that is, the BCCI,"" said the BCCI secretary.The BCCI introduced the ten-pointer SOPs following India's 3-1 defeat in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia. Under the new policy, spouses and children (aged under 18) can accompany the members of the Indian contingent for up to two weeks if the tour lasts more than 45 days. This policy was first implemented during the recently-held Champions Trophy. However, some senior India players have expressed their displeasure regarding it.""If you ask any player, do you want your family to be around you all the time? You'll be like, yes. I don't want to go to my room and just sit alone and sulk. I want to be able to be normal. And then you can really treat your game as something that is a responsibility. You finish that responsibility, and you come back to life,"" former India captain Virat Kohli said in Bengaluru recently.Saikia also asserted that India’s contracted players will have to play in domestic cricket as and when they are available for them. “There’s another important point that we’ve added in our guidelines. All the players, when they are available, have to play in domestic tournaments. If any player wants to skip or avoid playing in any tournament or match in the domestic circuit, they have to take the approval of the (India) head coach (Gautam Gambhir) and the chairman of the selection committee (Ajit Agarkar). This has been done so that all the young players get a chance to play with the seniors. It will help the senior players in keeping in touch with the game, if they are not playing international matches,” the BCCI secretary said.Meanwhile, Saikia clarified that Nitin Patel, head of its Sports Science wing at the BCCI's new Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru did not resign, but is on a three-month extension, after his contract was over on Dec 31.""It has been wrongly reported by the media that Patel has resigned. His contract/tenure was over on Dec 31, 2024. Then we made him a special request to extend his tenure by three months, which he agreed to. His extended contract will be over by March 31, 2025. We are trying to get a new person (to replace him). We are in talks with a few people. We wanted Nitin to continue, but he's got a pressing personal (family) issue to attend to, so can't continue, so we will have an alternative person in his place,"" Saikia told TOI.","The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) remains firm that the newly- formulated policy will stay in place.

NEW DELHI: A small village, Budhana, in Uttar Pradesh was wrapped in an unfamiliar aroma of festivity. People turned up in numbers. Puja Tomar had become a queen overnight. Garland after garland was placed around her neck, flower petals showered down on her, and everyone pushed forward, eager for a handshake. It was as if she was a national hero. But, wasn't she?In June last year, Puja became the first Indian to win a UFC bout, beating Brazil’s Rayanne Amanda dos Santos in a razor-close split decision.For her, this wasn’t just a fight won in an octagon -- but a fight that began the day she was born.“My parents didn’t want me,” Puja tells TimesofIndia.com, not with bitterness, but a quiet defiance. “When I was born, my father fainted. They had already decided not to raise a third daughter. I was left in a pot, to die.”Puja Tomar was born in the village near Muzaffarnagar, where the value of a girl was often weighed against the eventual dowry.Her two elder sisters, Anjali and Anu, were already defying the odds: one became a nurse, the other an MBBS doctor. But Puja? She was the one nobody wanted.“I always felt I had to prove something. Not just to my family, but to the world. That a girl isn’t a burden.”Her earliest heroes, nevertheless, were not athletes or politicians -- they were the likes of Jackie Chan and the characters she saw on grainy YouTube videos.However, she didn’t watch them for entertainment. She watched to learn. By 12th grade, a local karate teacher came to her school. And that was all she needed.One day, in a karate match, seven-year-old Puja, always eager to throw a punch at boys, hit an opponent so hard they passed out. She was immediately disqualified.“This sport isn’t for you -- try something else,” she laughs. “But it felt like I was in a movie -- like Jackie Chan. I just knew I wanted to fight.”""I started off just wanting to beat boys up, but eventually realised this could be a proper sport,"" she adds.With Puja needing more freedom than karate could offer, her real break came through Wushu, a martial art that combines grace and combat.With her uncle’s help, she found her way to SAI Bhopal. She spent five years there, sharpening her craft.But when she was offered a job as a constable after years of training, it felt like an insult.“After everything, a constable’s job? I couldn’t accept that,” she says. “And my sister was in MBBS. She needed money. That’s when I heard about MMA .”No contracts. No pay. No guarantee. She fought anyway. Eventually, in Delhi, someone offered her money to fight. She said yes -- not for fame, but to pay tuition fees.From there, the 31-year-old puncher has now reached a point where she can easily spend around Rs 1.5 to 2 lakhs a month on her MMA team.Off the mat, she sketches. Her wall is covered in drawings and craftwork. “My hobbies are completely opposite of fighting,” she says, grinning. “But I love it. It keeps me grounded.”She prays before fights -- not to win, but to find clarity. Her training is brutal: two sessions a day, strict diet, intense drills. “Sometimes, the training is so hard I can’t even sleep. But I know it’s what it takes.”Her coach, Mike, helped her train through an ankle injury that delayed her upcoming fight. Now, she’s set to face Ireland’s Shauna Bannon on March 22 at UFC Fight Night 254 .“I’m mentally ready,” she says. “This is going to be a big year. My goal is to reach the top. I know I can bring the belt home.”Before her fight in Louisville, a Japanese interviewer asked her bluntly: “Do you really think Indian fighters can do anything outside cricket?”It stung.“I just smiled,” she says. “Because I wanted to show that India is not just cricket. We have fighters, too.”On June 8, 2024, she did just that. With a flurry of calculated strikes, relentless pressure, and heart, she edged out Santos in a historic decision. It wasn’t just her win, it was India’s.Back in her village, people wept in joy. Her mother now walks around proudly saying, “That’s my daughter.”ALSO SEE: The good and not so good about Sunil Chhetri's comeback ""My mom is proud and always excited to talk to the media,"" she adds.Her sisters -- one in scrubs, the other in a white coat -- cheered louder than anyone.Puja never got to prove herself to her father -- he passed away before she could. But in every punch, in every takedown, in every minute of every round, she carries that fire.“When I got older, my mom told me that when I was born, my dad fainted. They had kept me aside to let me die because they didn’t want another girl,"" she confesses. ""But when I cried, my mom pulled me out of that pot and decided to save me. I always carried that pain. I never imagined he (father) would pass away, but I always wanted to prove to him that the girl who made you faint, she’s capable of so much.""",Puja Tomar is the first Indian to win a UFC bout. She beat Rayanne Amanda dos Santos in a razor-close split decision. Puja was born in a village where the value of a girl was often weighed against the eventual dowry.

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

NEW DELHI: In a move that could potentially influence global cricket, the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is considering lifting the ban on applying saliva to the ball during the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) season, scheduled to commence on March 22.According to PTI, this proposal has been extensively discussed within the BCCI and will be presented to the captains of all IPL teams during a meeting in Mumbai on Thursday.The International Cricket Council (ICC) had initially prohibited the age-old practice of applying saliva to shine the ball as a precautionary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic.In 2022, the ICC made this ban permanent. While the IPL had adhered to the ICC's guidelines in the aftermath of the pandemic, its playing conditions are not bound by the sport's governing body.""Using saliva on the ball was part of the essence of the game until COVID hit. Now that we don't have that threat anymore, we feel there is no harm in lifting the ban on saliva in the IPL.""We understand that it makes a bigger impact in red-ball cricket but even if it can help bowlers a bit in the white ball game, it should be allowed in the IPL, which is a trend-setting tournament. Let's see what the captains decide tomorrow,"" a BCCI official told PTI.If the ban is revoked in the IPL, it could potentially influence the ICC to review its stance on the subject. Several prominent cricketers, including Mohammed Shami, Vernon Philander, and Tim Southee, have previously advocated for the use of saliva to aid reverse swing and maintain a balance between bat and ball.In addition to the saliva ban discussion, the IPL is set to approve the use of the Decision Review System (DRS) for height wides and wides outside the off-stump.This move aims to enhance the accuracy of wide ball decisions by utilising Hawk-Eye and ball-tracking technology.Teams will be allowed to review instances where the on-field umpire has signalled a wide ball for height, enabling them to challenge the decision if they believe the ball was not high enough to warrant a wide call.","The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is considering lifting the ban on applying saliva to the ball during the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) season.

NEW DELHI: It’s been 17 years since Virat Kohli lifted the U-19 World Cup trophy. From that team, only Ravindra Jadeja, Manish Pandey and Kohli are still active in the IPL. This season, they will be reuniting with one more of their teammates when Tanmay Srivastava makes his debut as a BCCI-qualified umpire.Incidentally, Srivastava was India’s top-scorer in the U-19 World Cup final against South Africa in 2008, which earned him a contract with Kings XI Punjab. Srivastava has been fast-tracked as an umpire by the BCCI after clearing the Level 2 course in two years. At 35, he is set to earn the distinction of becoming the first player to have both played and officiated in the IPL.For now, he hasn’t been given on-field duties this season. While most players from the batch have recently retired or are no longer active in top-level cricket , Srivastava decided to retire as a player in 2020 while he was captaining Uttarakhand after moving from UP at the age of 30.“I understood that was the best player I could be,” Srivastava told TOI. “I was nowhere close to playing the IPL. I had to decide if I wanted to prolong life as a player or have a longer successful second innings.”Srivastava admits it was about swallowing his ego. “I am still in touch with Virat, but I had to decide for myself and have a practical outlook,” he added.It was an honest discussion with current BCCI vice-president Rajiv Shukla, a UP cricket mainstay, that gave him clarity.“I told Shukla sir that I wanted to do something else in cricket other than playing. He was a bit taken aback since I was still just 30. Then we discussed what the options could be. I did my Level 2 course in coaching in NCA, but I knew the best I could become was fielding coach. I decided to focus on umpiring,” Srivastava said.In 2020, when he was preparing for the umpiring exams, Srivastava juggled cricketing jobs, a talent scout for RCB and fielding coach for U-16s at NCA and for Jammu and Kashmir.“Studying for umpiring is tough. I used to stay up at nights. You have to study a lot to understand the laws and its implications,” he said.Srivastava credits the BCCI’s umpiring programme, which has a players’ quota.“There is certain relaxation for players irrespective of the level of cricket they’ve played. The board is encouraging young players to take up umpiring rather than heavily depending on older people with bookish knowledge,” he said.",Tanmay Srivastava will make his IPL debut as a BCCI-qualified umpire.

As he prepares for his first match in 10 months, MS Dhoni is proving he still has what it takes to compete at the highest level during the Chennai Super Kings ’ training camp for the IPL 2025 season.At 43, Dhoni is one of the oldest players in this season’s IPL. In a recent training session, he reminded everyone of his classic skills, showcasing his signature shots. A video shared on social media captures him taking on fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana , reminiscent of his dominance over Sri Lankan great Lasith Malinga in his prime.During the session at MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chepauk, Chennai, Dhoni executed his famous ' Helicopter shot ', effortlessly sending a low-full toss from Pathirana flying down the ground.As he embarks on his 18th season in the league, having led CSK to five championship titles, Dhoni remains the team’s primary wicket-keeper. Thanks to the BCCI’s updated retention rules, CSK managed to retain Dhoni as an ‘uncapped’ player for just Rs 4 crore ahead of the IPL 2025 Mega Auction.Although CSK didn’t qualify for the playoffs last season, Dhoni continued to impress despite knee issues, scoring 161 runs off 73 balls with 14 fours and 13 sixes for an astonishing strike rate of 220.55.CSK are set to kick off their campaign at home against the Mumbai Indians this Sunday (March 23).",Chennai Super Kings are preparing for the IPL 2025 season.

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

NEW DELHI: India cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has praised the incredible depth of Indian cricket following the team's unbeaten run to the 2025 Champions Trophy title, achieved even without ace pacer Jasprit Bumrah . Reflecting on the triumph, Gavaskar made a bold claim that no individual player is indispensable in the current Indian lineup — not even veteran batters Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma Writing in his column for Mid-Day, Gavaskar remarked, ""The triumph in the Champions Trophy and that too without Bumrah also emphasises that nobody is indispensable in this game. In the past too, India has won without Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, but there’s not the slightest doubt that their presence in the team gives the team an even more invincible look.""Gavaskar lauded Team India ’s resilience after bouncing back from a dismal Test series defeat against Australia to clinch victory in the England T20Is and ODIs, followed by the Champions Trophy. He noted how the team’s ability to triumph without their key players showcased the immense talent pool in Indian cricket.""Very seldom has a team depended on one individual like the Indians depended on Jasprit Bumrah in Australia, and his absence from the bowling attack to defend the small target set by India tilted the scales Australia’s way,"" Gavaskar said. ""For the Indian team to bounce back the way they did with comprehensive wins in the ODI and T20 series against England that were played on the team’s return to India tells volumes of the talent that Indian cricket has.""The cricketing great also acknowledged the support from overseas players, who admitted that India would have emerged victorious regardless of the location, dismissing claims that the Dubai setting played a decisive role. ""It is good to see so many overseas cricketers now coming up and saying India would have won anyway wherever they played and not only because they were stationed in Dubai,"" Gavaskar added.Gavaskar’s remarks reflect a sense of confidence in the current Indian setup, asserting that while legends like Kohli and Rohit undeniably elevate the team, the core strength lies in the depth and talent of the entire squad.","India cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has praised the incredible depth of Indian cricket following the team's unbeaten run to the 2025 Champions Trophy title.

CHALLENGES FOR NEW CAPTAINS AXAR AND PATIDAR

NEW DELHI: The upcoming IPL season might give cricket fans another glimpse of MS Dhoni ’s brilliance, as the former Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) captain is expected to bat lower in the order at No. 7 or No. 8. According to former India batter Robin Uthappa , this strategy would allow Dhoni to maximize his impact in a limited number of deliveries.At 43, Dhoni has shown no signs of slowing down, proving his readiness for IPL 2025 during a CSK net session on Tuesday. In a display of his signature power-hitting, he launched a searing yorker from Matheesha Pathirana over the bowler’s head with his trademark helicopter shot.""As far as Mahi is concerned, I think we will get to see glimpses of his brilliance because I have a feeling that he might bat at number 7 or number 8. Very much like last year, and we will see him bat between 12 and 20 balls through the season,"" Uthappa said.However, when asked if this would be Dhoni’s final IPL season, Uthappa remained non-committal.""I don't think the passion ever dies. MS' love for the game has not dwindled at all. I think his passion for the game keeps him going. At 43, I think he's got the fastest hands in the world as a wicketkeeper.""And if you've got those skills and if you've got the passion to keep going, I don't think anything should stop you. I won't be surprised if he retires at the end of the season. But I won't be surprised if he even goes on to play for another four seasons after this,"" Uthappa, a JioStar expert, said while addressing the media before the start of IPL 2025.The IPL 2025 season will also mark the return of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma to the T20 format for the first time since India’s T20 World Cup triumph in 2024.Uthappa believes both veteran batters are set for an excellent season.""I don't think they'll have even an iota of issues to come out there and smash the living daylights out of bowlers. Virat has really come through in good form. He's familiar with conditions in Bangalore, and he's always going to thrive there,"" he said.""In the recent past, Rohit hasn't lived up to his potential as the incredibly dynamic batter that he is in the IPL. But it looks like everything is going his way at this point in time. So, I wouldn't put it past him to have one of his best seasons in the IPL,"" Uthappa added.This IPL season will also see first-time captains leading franchises, with Axar Patel taking charge of Delhi Capitals and Rajat Patidar captaining Royal Challengers Bengaluru.Uthappa acknowledged the challenges ahead for the two young skippers but expressed confidence in their ability to adapt.""Axar will be in a little bit better stead because even with the new-ish side, there are still a lot of familiar faces. With Rajat also, it's a similar situation. But Rajat will have to contend with the superstardom of Kohli within that side. So, he can lean on Kohli's captaincy skills a lot. Rajat is in a unique position to be able to take RCB forward.""Rajat being there at the helm right now, he will have to figure out his mode of leadership. He has done fairly well with leadership in domestic cricket.""Another major challenge for both captains will be managing their bowlers in high-scoring venues like Bengaluru and Delhi, where shorter boundaries often negate home-ground advantages.""The challenges would be home conditions. How do you win in home conditions? Especially both in these similar venues like Delhi and in Bangalore—small grounds, high-scoring grounds, no real home advantage.""So, they'll have to figure out a solution for that as leaders. For me, I think that would be one of the biggest challenges that they would face,"" Uthappa said.",Robin Uthappa says MS Dhoni will bat at No. 7 or No. 8 in IPL 2025.

SQUAD:

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals head into the IPL 2025 season with renewed hope under new captain Axar Patel , following Rishabh Pant’s move to Lucknow Super Giants. With fresh faces and a star-studded lineup, the team is determined to claim the elusive IPL trophy. Despite being a consistent contender, Delhi Capitals have reached the final only once—in 2020—when they fell short against Mumbai Indians, losing by five wickets.Can captain Axar change their fortunes?One of the standout signings for Delhi Capitals this season is the dynamic keeper-batter KL Rahul , who was bought for Rs 14 crores.The team’s pace attack has been bolstered by the inclusion of Australian pacer Mitchell Starc , making their bowling department a force to be reckoned with. Starc will be supported by T. Natarajan, Mukesh Kumar, and Mohit Sharma in the pace department.In the batting department, Delhi Capitals boast of hard-hitting veteran Faf Du Plessis, KL Rahul, Tristan Stubbs, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Karun Nair, and Ashutosh Sharma—who was a standout performer last year while playing for Punjab Kings.The spin department will be led by captain Axar Patel and Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav, both of whom were part of India's victorious campaign at the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, along with KL Rahul.The team has also made significant changes to its support staff, with Venugopal Rao as the Director of Cricket, Hemang Badani as the Head Coach, Kevin Pietersen as the Mentor, Matthew Mott as the Assistant Coach, Munaf Patel as the Bowling Coach, Anton Roux as the Fielding Coach, and Vijay Bharadwaj as the Head of Scouting.TimesofIndia.com presents a SWOT analysis of Delhi Capitals ahead of IPL 2025:Delhi Capitals undoubtedly boast an explosive batting lineup on paper. With Faf Du Plessis, Fraser-McGurk, KL Rahul, Abishek Porel, and Tristan Stubbs forming a powerful top order, they have the potential to make a strong start right from the first ball. The middle order, featuring Karun Nair, Sameer Rizvi, Ashutosh Sharma, and captain Axar Patel, has the ability to turn the game around at any given moment.The pace attack is equally formidable, with one of the world’s top left-arm pacers, Mitchell Starc, leading the charge.Alongside him, T. Natarajan, the death-overs specialist, Dushmantha Chameera, the rejuvenated Mohit Sharma, and Mukesh Kumar strengthen the pace department.However, Delhi Capitals' primary weakness lies in their spin options.While Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav are experienced, the team lacks depth in this department. To address this, they have signed uncapped Indian spinner Ajay Mandal, offering some potential for the spin attack.Jake Fraser-McGurk, Faf du Plessis, KL Rahul, Abishek Porel (wk), Axar Patel (c), Tristan Stubbs, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Mukesh Kumar, Mohit Sharma, T NatarajanFaf du Plessis, Karun Nair, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Sameer Rizvi, Ashutosh Sharma, Tripurana Vijay, Vipraj Nigam, Axar Patel, Darshan Nalkande, Ajay Jadav Mandal, Manvanth Kumar L, Madhav Tiwari, Tristan Stubbs, Abishek Porel, Donovan Ferreira, KL Rahul, Kuldeep Yadav, Dushmantha Chameera, Mitchell Starc, Mohit Sharma, T Natarajan, Mukesh Kumar","Delhi Capitals have reached the final of the IPL only once, in 2020.

Additionally, Sunrisers Hyderabad established new records by scoring 287/3 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru and achieving the highest power-play score of 125/0 when facing Delhi Capitals.“You constantly witness underrated talents delivering exceptional performances. The tournament's structure, with frequent matches and travel, keeps players engaged. If you're winning, the momentum carries you forward, with three, four, or even five consecutive victories. However, injuries can make things difficult,"" the GT captain added.Gujarat Titans will begin their IPL 2025 campaign against Punjab Kings at Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium. Gill discussed the capabilities of his squad, who clinched the IPL title in their inaugural appearance in 2022.""We have a strong fast-bowling attack. Rashid has been with us, and we have explosive batters like Rutherford, Philips, and Butler. Some talented Indian players like Mahipal and Sai add depth to our squad. The key to success in a long tournament like the IPL is maintaining balance,"" Gill said.""Losing two or three matches in a row isn't a major concern if you are playing the right way and making smart decisions. Consistency in team selection and strategy is important. The more you play based on probability and logic, the better your chances of qualifying (for the playoffs).""","Gujarat Titans' captain Shubman Gill predicts that the coming Indian Premier League IPL season could might well see one of the teams putting up a total of 300 on the board.
