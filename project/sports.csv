Aware of the political slugfest over Rahul's allegations, SC refrained from commenting on the merits of the issue and asked the petitioner to approach EC. ""We are not inclined to entertain this writ petition purportedly filed in public interest.

What happened to Joshua Palmer? Bills WR leaves Monday Night Football after painful hip-drop tackle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/what-happened-to-joshua-palmer-bills-wr-leaves-monday-night-football-after-painful-hip-drop-tackle/articleshow/124540712.cms,"Joshua Palmer injury (AP Photos)

What happened to Joshua Palmer?



Bills face uncertainty as Palmer’s status remains unclear



Joshua Palmer’s injury turned what was meant to be a redemption night for the Buffalo Bills into a cause for concern. Heading into Monday Night Football, the Bills were desperate to rebound from their loss to the New England Patriots, hoping to regain rhythm against the Atlanta Falcons. But just as their offense began to click, the spotlight shifted from the scoreboard to the sideline when Palmer went down in visible pain early in the second quarter.Joshua Palmer, who joined the Bills in the offseason to strengthen their receiving unit, looked poised for a breakout game. He opened with a spectacular 45-yard reception on Buffalo’s first offensive play and followed it with a 15-yard catch early in the second quarter. Just as he seemed ready to become a difference-maker, disaster struck.On that second grab, cornerback Dee Alford tackled Palmer awkwardly, his leg caught underneath him in what many described as a “textbook hip-drop tackle.” NFL Network’s Mike Garofolo reported, “#Bills WR Josh Palmer injured after what looked like a textbook hip-drop tackle. No flag.” The wideout limped off the field in visible pain before heading into the blue medical tent.Trainers taped his left ankle as fans held their breath, hoping the injury wasn’t serious.Before the incident, Palmer had already recorded 60 yards on two catches — nearly matching his season-high total from Week 1. His quick start had sparked optimism that he was finally finding rhythm in Buffalo’s offense. Unfortunately, his night — and possibly his momentum — was cut short.Palmer’s injury came at a time when the Bills needed all hands on deck. Known for their “everyone eats” philosophy, Buffalo had relied on a balanced passing attack through the first six weeks. While Palmer’s overall numbers weren’t flashy, his impact went beyond the stat sheet. He ranked among the team’s most efficient wideouts, second only to Khalil Shakir in WR Impact rating.If Palmer’s injury sidelines him for an extended stretch, the Bills will have to lean on Shakir, rookie Keon Coleman, and tight end Dawson Knox to fill the void. As of now, his official status remains questionable, but fans are hoping the promising receiver’s momentum hasn’t been halted for long.Buffalo’s offense, once again, finds itself at a crossroads — and Joshua Palmer’s health could play a major role in shaping what comes next.Also Read: Fred Warner injury update: 49ers lose their heartbeat as star linebacker set for season-ending surgery","Buffalo Bills wideout Joshua Palmer suffered an ankle injury against the Atlanta Falcons on Monday Night Football.

Bills fans drown out Falcons, forcing early communication breakdown



Bills Mafia proves their road dominance once again

Bills Mafia once again proved why they’re one of the loudest and most loyal fanbases in the NFL , this time, on the road. During Monday Night Football in Atlanta, the Buffalo Bills’ traveling fans turned Mercedes-Benz Stadium into a sea of blue and red, creating a noise level so deafening that the home team, the Atlanta Falcons, was forced to use a silent count, a stunning reversal of home-field advantage.The unusual scene unfolded in the first quarter with the game tied 7–7. On the Falcons’ second offensive drive, quarterback Michael Penix Jr. and his offensive line visibly struggled to hear the snap count as chants and cheers from Bills fans filled the domed stadium. The volume reached such a pitch that Atlanta had to switch to a silent cadence, a move typically reserved for visiting teams in hostile environments.The chaos didn’t stop there. Falcons left tackle Jake Matthews was called for a false start immediately after, a direct result of the crowd noise disrupting communication at the line of scrimmage. For a home team, it was a rare and humbling moment that highlighted just how far Buffalo’s fanbase will go to support their team.Buffalo’s fans are well-known for traveling in massive numbers, often taking over opposing stadiums from Miami to Los Angeles. But this latest display in Atlanta might be one of their most impressive yet. Social media lit up with videos showing waves of Bills fans filling entire sections of Mercedes-Benz Stadium, chanting “Let’s Go Buffalo!” with playoff-level energy.While the Falcons have been trying to rebuild momentum behind their young quarterback, Monday’s atmosphere served as a reminder that passion can tip the scales, even in a modern dome designed to neutralize noise.Also Read: Josh Allen’s heartwarming game-day ritual shows how deeply he’s in love with wife Hailee Steinfeld For Buffalo, it was another proud moment for one of football’s most devoted communities.

Friendship whispers resurface after Blake Lively’s lawsuit drama

How Travis Kelce fits into Taylor Swift’s redefined circle



As Taylor Swift continues her global domination with The Life of a Showgirl, fans are now shifting their attention from her chart-topping music to her rekindled friendships and perhaps even her relationship balance with NFL star Travis Kelce . The latest whisper comes from Deuxmoi, where insiders claim Swift and her longtime friend Blake Lively may have quietly reunited after months of rumored distance.According to Deuxmoi’s October 9th Deux/U podcast, a discreet source revealed that Taylor Swift and Blake Lively “may have allegedly seen each other in the last few weeks.” The insider described the encounter as “not strained, rather friends just being friends.” The rumor comes months after Lively’s public “It Ends With Us” lawsuit against actor Justin Baldoni, which narrowly brushed against Swift’s name.While details remain private, the speculation has sparked excitement among fans who feared the pair’s friendship had fizzled. Observant Swifties also pointed out that Taylor Swift was recently spotted wearing a Lorraine Schwartz bracelet—the same one Blake Lively wore to the It Ends With Us London premiere in 2024. Was it a subtle nod of support, or just another of Swift’s famous Easter eggs?Adding another layer, Taylor Swift’s track “CANCELLED!” from her new album has stirred conversation for its apparent empathy toward a friend facing public backlash. Many believe the song was inspired by Lively’s experience, a move that would mark Swift’s quiet show of loyalty rather than shade.As Swift navigates her increasingly public relationship with Travis Kelce, some fans wonder whether her time in Kansas City and her global tour life have naturally distanced her from Hollywood friends. Yet, if reports of a Lively-Swift reunion are true, it could signal that the pop star is rebalancing her worlds, one where the NFL and Hollywood coexist peacefully.Also Read: “Shape of a….”: Taylor Swift’s ‘Wood’ sparks chaos as fans uncover steamy new hidden tour detail and Travis Kelce reacts Swift, who is the godmother to Lively and Ryan Reynolds’ children, seems unlikely to let that bond fade completely.

CeeDee Lamb’s Week 7 status remains uncertain as Cowboys monitor WR’s recovery



George Pickens emerges as key player amid CeeDee Lamb’s absence



The Cowboys are striking fear across the NFC! - Michael Irvin reacts to CeeDee Lamb’s injury update

The Dallas Cowboys could see a potential boost in Week 7 as attention turns to star wide receiver CeeDee Lamb. Lamb has been sidelined for three consecutive games after suffering a high-ankle sprain in Week 3 against the Chicago Bears. While his absence has been felt, signs of progress have sparked hope for his availability against the Washington Commanders.Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones provided an update on Lamb’s status during an appearance on 105.3 The Fan. He revealed that Lamb, along with wide receiver KaVontae Turpin and right guard Tyler Booker, “have a chance” to participate in Week 7. The team’s first official injury report of the week, expected on Wednesday, will provide more clarity on Lamb’s playing chances.Lamb’s recovery has taken positive steps, with recent on-field activity signaling progress. Last week, he was seen working with resistance bands on a side field for the first time since the injury, showing that his rehabilitation is moving in the right direction. While the Cowboys remain cautious, Lamb’s potential return is creating anticipation for their upcoming matchup.In the absence of CeeDee Lamb, No. 2 wide receiver George Pickens has risen to the occasion, emerging as the Cowboys’ primary offensive weapon.Over the last three games, Pickens has recorded 19 receptions for 359 yards and four touchdowns, proving he can handle the responsibilities of a top receiver. He has now scored a touchdown in five consecutive games, and his 168 receiving yards in Week 6 marked a season-high performance. His consistency has given Dak Prescott a reliable target and kept the Cowboys’ passing game highly productive despite Lamb’s absence.If Lamb is able to join the lineup in Week 7 while Pickens continues his stellar play, the Cowboys’ aerial attack could become one of the league’s most formidable. Dak Prescott will benefit from multiple elite receiving options, making Dallas a tough team to defend through the air.As the Week 7 matchup with the Washington Commanders approaches, CeeDee Lamb’s status will be a critical factor for the Cowboys’ game plan. Whether he returns or continues his recovery, Dallas’ offensive firepower remains a key storyline, with George Pickens’ recent performances ensuring the passing attack stays strong and dynamic.Also Read: Brian Callahan Fired: Titans to seek new Head Coach amid disappointing start with rookie QB Cam Ward","Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones provided an update on wide receiver CeeDee Lamb’s status during an appearance on 105.3 The Fan.

On October 13, NFL Insider Ian Rapoport reported that the NFL will be reviewing the actions of Detroit Lions defensive back Brian Branch following last night's game against the Kansas City Chiefs, with a likely fine or worse awaiting him. In reaction to Rapoport’s news, one fan replied, “No excuses for what Branch did, but the NFL should review JuJu for discipline too.” Another fan clearly took sides, “Thing is….I can see Juju running his mouth in this situation. Branch reacting was lame, but Juju has been getting under people’s skin for years.” A third fan seemed angry, “Imagine getting blocked in the back and cheap shotted all game just for a TikTok Twat in Juju Smith-Schuster to come up to you and make a snarky remark (we know he did). You’d punch him in the face too. F*ck the refs and the chiefs.”The Chiefs defeated the Lions in the SNF game by a score of 30-17. After the game, Patrick Mahomes attempted a handshake with Branch, but Branch ignored him. Smith-Schuster then reacted, approaching Branch. Branch struck Smith-Schuster in the face, knocking him to the ground. Smith-Schuster got up and chased Branch, players and referees intervened, resulting in an on-field altercation.Branch later said, “It was a childish thing, but I'm tired of people doing stuff in between the play and refs don't catch it. They be trying to bully me out there. I should have never did it. It was childish.” The defensive back said that he was blocked by Smith-Schuster toward the end of the game in front of the referees but they didn’t respond: “I could’ve got hurt off of that play, I still shouldn’t have done that.” Smith-Schuster clarified, “I’m just doing my job. I play between the whistles.” There is a perception among some fans that referees often side with Kansas City . Discussing the incident, Smith-Schuster said, “He’s a great player and he’s huge for their team. After the game, I expected to shake his hand and say, ‘good game,’ but he threw a punch.”Infuriated fans supposedly knew what led to the scuffle between Lions LB and Chiefs WR—with one demanding, “Now show the dirty block in the back not called on juju.” Another reiterating, “Now show the cheap shot that led to that.” And a third fan declared, “The NFL needs to review their own actions while they are at it….” A fourth fan wrote, “The refs intentionally created this environment.

Chloe Kitts sidelined as Gamecocks star suffers ACL tear ahead of 2025-26 season opener

What makes ACL tears every athlete’s worst nightmare?

South Carolina women's basketball suffered a significant setback as the club revealed on Monday that senior Chloe Kitts will miss the 2025–26 season due to a torn ACL in her right knee. She is an outstanding player, and was voted an honorable mention All-American and the MVP of both the NCAA Birmingham 2 Regional and the SEC Tournament. However, she will now miss the entire season.Due to the torn ACL in her right knee, South Carolina women's basketball's Chloe Kitts won't be on the court at all during the 2025–26 season. She will also have to undergo surgery for the same this week. As a senior and a clutch Gamecocks starter, Kitts has helped lead the team to victory in the 2024 National Championship and other national championship finals. Announcing the news, the team’s head coach Dawn Staley said:“We hate this first for Chloe, who has worked incredibly hard to become the best version of herself on the court this season.. Her teammates are capable of stepping up, and I know that her competitive fire and tenacity will be felt from the sidelines as she pours what she can into them to ensure our team’s success.”It was announced only a few weeks before the South Carolina team's exhibition game against Anderson. Additionally, this is actually the team's unofficial 2025-26 season opener. The announcement further states that Kitts has helped the team make back-to-back national championship game appearances.She is a phenomenal player and posted 2.82 per game and eight offensive rebounds and ninth in the SEC. Her fans are all waiting for her planned surgery later this week and wishing him a speedy recovery.Last season, she averaged 7.7 rebounds per game and set career highs in both scoring and grabbing rebounds. With career-high averages of 10.2 points during the previous season, Kitts was named honorable mention All-America.She also won MVP awards at the NCAA Birmingham 2 Regional and the SEC Tournament, highlighting her outstanding play. The South Carolina Gamecocks, the current SEC regular-season and tournament champions, will play Anderson in an exhibition game at Colonial Life Arena on October 24 to unofficially begin the 2025–26 season The ACL is the most often injured knee ligament. It serves as the link between the thigh and shin bones. ACL tears are typically caused by sports injuries. A person will most likely require surgery to repair their ACL if they tear it. The majority of ACL tear victims recover completely and return to sports without any lasting effects. ACL tears often require six to nine months to heal.ACL injuries are among the more common knee issues that players sustain. People who participate in rigorous sports, such as football, basketball, netball, soccer, European team handball, gymnastics, and downhill skiing, are more likely to experience them. They might be severe, when the ligament is totally torn, or mild, like minor rips or sprains. Injuries may be non-contact or contact.Also read: Fred VanVleet suffers ruptured ACL, dealing a major blow to Houston Rockets’ 2025–26 championship hopes",South Carolina women's basketball's Chloe Kitts will miss the 2025–26 season due to a torn ACL in her right knee.

San Antonio Spurs and Indiana Pacers

San Antonio Spurs Injury Report (October 13, 2025)

Indiana Pacers Injury Report (October 13, 2025)

Thewill meet in a preseason matchup on October 13, 2025, with both teams dealing with a long list of injuries that could significantly influence player rotations and team chemistry. As both sides prepare for the upcoming NBA season, managing health and evaluating roster depth will be the main focus heading into this game.The San Antonio Spurs are facing a tough stretch with multiple key players sidelined or under evaluation. Star guard De’Aaron Fox remains out due to a hamstring injury and is not expected to return until early November, meaning he will miss the start of the regular season. Rookie guard Stephon Castle is listed as questionable after suffering a bruised knee, though early assessments suggest he’s on track for a full recovery without any long-term setback.Additionally, Jordan McLaughlin and Kelly Olynyk are both uncertain to play, with McLaughlin managing general soreness and Olynyk nursing a heel injury. Jeremy Sochan also joins the list of questionable players as he continues to recover from a left calf issue sustained during the offseason.On a positive note, rookie Dylan Harper is expected to be available. Harper’s recovery from a thumb ligament injury has been quicker than anticipated, allowing him to rejoin the rotation.However, the big question remains the status of Victor Wembanyama. The 7-foot-4 phenom has been dominant throughout the preseason, but there’s speculation that the San Antonio Spurs may rest him against Indiana to prioritize long-term health as the regular season nears.The Indiana Pacers are also entering this contest short-handed, most notably without their franchise cornerstone Tyrese Haliburton, who continues to recover from Achilles surgery. His absence is expected to last the entire season, forcing Indiana to rely on a mix of veterans and emerging talent.Veteran guards Kam Jones and T.J. McConnell will miss the game as well, with Jones battling a back injury and McConnell dealing with hamstring issues. Forward Pascal Siakam and guard Andrew Nembhard are listed as questionable, with the team likely resting them or managing minor ailments.Meanwhile, young guards Johnny Furphy and Quenton Jackson have recently suffered ankle and hamstring injuries, leaving their availability in doubt. These absences will push the Indiana Pacers to lean on their bench depth and younger prospects, offering them a chance to step up in expanded roles during the preseason.The Pacers are coming off a remarkable 2024-25 season that saw them reach the NBA Finals, but this preseason marks the beginning of a transitional phase without Haliburton. Pascal Siakam will be expected to take on a heavier offensive workload as Indiana explores new lineup combinations and evaluates its supporting cast.On the other side, the San Antonio Spurs continue their rebuilding process after missing the playoffs. The franchise remains committed to developing its young core, centered around Wembanyama and Harper, while integrating key veterans like Olynyk to provide leadership and experience.This game will serve as an important barometer for both teams - the Indiana Pacers testing their resilience amid major injuries and the San Antonio Spurs assessing their roster depth ahead of the new season. Despite several absences, the matchup at Gainbridge Fieldhouse is expected to offer intriguing storylines, particularly around how both coaching staffs adjust rotations and minutes to keep players healthy while maintaining competitiveness.Also read: San Antonio Spurs vs Indiana Pacers Preseason Game Prediction, Odds, Spread, Best NBA Prop Bets, and Betting Breakdown (October 13, 2025) Ultimately, the San Antonio Spurs vs. Indiana Pacers preseason showdown will not only highlight the progress of their developing rosters but also underscore the strategic importance of managing workloads and fine-tuning systems as the 2025-26 NBA season approaches.","The San Antonio Spurs and Indiana Pacers will meet in a preseason matchup on October 13, 2025.

Every NFL moment is memorable. For some, it’s touchdowns; for others, sacks. For the 30-year-old Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback, Jalen Ramsey, it’s about sacks—and some added bonuses. After the team’s crushing 23-9 win over the Cleveland Browns, Ramsey told ESPN’s Brooke Pryor, “I'm going to probably tell my kids about this—I played in a game with T.J. Watt and Myles Garrett, and I had two sacks. That's crazy.”In July, even before the season began, Steelers linebacker T.J. Watt praised Jalen Ramsey on The Pat McAfee Show, saying the cornerback can impact the game in many ways: “He’s a Swiss Army knife of our defense right now. You’re going to see him play in every position. And any time those guys lock down just for an extra half a second, we love it coz it allows us to get to the quarterback.” Myles Garrett and Jalen Ramsey are divisional rivals—and when the Steelers defeat a divisional rival? It becomes a story to tell the kids.Not once, but twice Browns rookie starting quarterback Dillon Gabriel was sacked by Pittsburgh’s cornerback, Jalen Ramsey—once in the first quarter when Ramsey blitzed off the left edge and ran unscathed towards Gabriel and again in the fourth when Ramsey dodged two Browns wide receivers, got missed by Browns tight end Blake Whiteheart and chased the rookie starter out of the pocket, dragging him down four yards shy of the line of scrimmage.Steelers safety DeShon Elliott was in awe of Ramsey’s on-field magic. The safety was in shock when he saw Gabriel being dragged down by Ramsey: “He’s a potential gold jacket. You kind of expect those things from somebody like that. When it happens, though, you’re like, dang—especially when I saw him track the quarterback down from one side, run to the other. I didn’t know his old self still had it. I didn’t know he had that speed on him still. But no, he’s a dog. I expect it out of him, but we’ve got a lot more to go, so it’ll be fun.”In the post-win conference, Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers expressed deep respect for the seven-time Pro Bowler, Jalen Ramsey: “I do want to make a point and talk about Ramsey, because what he did this week getting ready to play, I've been around the game a long time, and I've seen a lot of guys in a situation where you got a Sunday/Thursday, skip both games. Where maybe they're 85%, but they want to be 100%, because I think there's a fear of failure almost that can paralyze them where if I don't play my best game, then what does that say about me if I'm not 100%?I think some guys are scared to go out there and play, but for Jalen to go out there with everything he's accomplished in this league, I just can't say enough about the level of respect I have for him. He had what—two sacks and pass break-ups and tackles. If there was any question about the type of person that he is—take away the incredible player—but the person and teammate, I think he just showed all of us the kind of guy that he is by going out there and playing today. ”Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin emphasized one-time Super Bowl champion Jalen Ramsey’s value in the Steelers vs. Browns matchup: “We certainly wanted to make sure that he (Jalen Ramsey) could impact the game. I cannot say enough about Jalen Ramsey. This guy plays outside corner, he plays nickel, he plays free safety. He is exactly what we hoped he would be and certainly he was significant today.”",Jalen Ramsey was unstoppable in the Steelers vs. Browns Week 6 Sunday Night Football matchup.

Connor Bedard emerges as key force in Blackhawks’ early-season push



The Chicago Blackhawks are still searching for their first win of the 2025-26 NHL season, but there’s no shortage of determination inside the locker room. Despite an 0-3 start, Connor Bedard and his teammates have shown signs of promise in every outing. Each game has slipped away by a single goal, leaving the Hawks frustrated yet far from defeated.The start may not look good on paper, but there’s growing belief within the Blackhawks’ camp that their hard work will soon pay off. Head coach Jeff Blashill has introduced a system emphasizing structure and discipline, and while the team hasn’t found its finishing touch yet, the effort level has been undeniable. Veteran forward Nick Foligno has made sure that message stays clear.“The mindset in here has to be: ‘Be comfortable in uncomfortable situations,’” Foligno told the Chicago Sun-Times. “We’re going to be in a lot of these games this year. We’ve got to make sure our details allow us to win instead of watching them slip away.”That mentality is exactly what the young Blackhawks need. Chicago has battled tough opponents early, falling 3-2 to the Florida Panthers, 4-3 in overtime to the Boston Bruins, and 3-2 to the Montreal Canadiens after a heartbreaking goal with just 15 seconds left.Those narrow defeats show a team that’s competing hard but still learning how to close games at the highest level.Connor Bedard continues to be the focal point of Chicago’s rebuild. The 20-year-old forward has displayed flashes of brilliance, creating scoring chances and keeping the Blackhawks competitive even against top-tier opponents. His chemistry with linemates is improving, and his leadership by example is becoming more visible with every game.For a rebuilding team, progress isn’t always measured in wins. The Blackhawks are building a foundation based on resilience, discipline, and belief — qualities Foligno has been pushing since training camp. As the team continues to buy into Blashill’s system, it’s only a matter of time before the effort turns into victories.The Blackhawks may be winless, but the energy surrounding this group tells a different story. With Bedard leading the charge and Foligno guiding the mindset, Chicago finally has a ray of hope shining through the early-season struggles.Also Read: Oilers secured a Gem: Connor McDavid claims NHL’s fastest player title, proving Edmonton made the right call with contract extension","The Chicago Blackhawks are still searching for their first win of the 2025-26 NHL season.

From college athlete to NFL fiancée — Olivia Carter ’s inspiring journey

The love story that grew alongside an NFL dream

Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Penix Jr. is quickly becoming one of the NFL’s rising stars, but off the field, he’s already found his forever teammate, fiancée Olivia Carter. The two have been inseparable since his early college days, and their relationship has only grown stronger through his rise to NFL fame.Born and raised in Washington, Carter’s life has always revolved around sports and family. A standout student-athlete, she played soccer at the University of Nevada, Reno, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in biology in 2022.According to her high school interview with Kent Reporter, she came from an athletic household where “we all do sports.” Her mother was a track star, her father played basketball, and her brother Quincy went on to play football at Central Washington University.That competitive spirit shaped Carter’s own journey, both on and off the field. She played as both a forward and defender for Nevada’s women’s soccer team and dreamed of becoming an anesthesiologist. After graduation, she took time to travel and focus on family before entering medical studies but life had other plans when she met Penix Jr.Carter and Penix Jr. went public with their relationship in late 2023, sharing affectionate posts on Instagram. Penix once called her his “ride or die,” thanking her for “always being there for me through the ups and downs.” The bond only deepened as Carter stood by his side during every major milestone from his 2024 NFL Draft moment to his first start as the Falcons’ quarterback.Penix Jr. famously shared that he got the call naming him the team’s starter while “shopping with my girlfriend at Costco,” saying he was so shocked he “wasn’t hungry no more.”By December 2024, the couple was engaged in a romantic proposal surrounded by red roses and glowing candles. Penix captioned the moment, “I will love you forever. I can’t wait to do life with you.”Also Read: Ciara opens up about her journey of self-care and strength as Russell Wilson stands beside her every step For fans watching his career take off, it’s clear: Olivia Carter isn’t just Michael Penix Jr.’s fiancée — she’s been his foundation, cheerleader, and best friend since the very start of his NFL journey.","Olivia Carter is the fiancée of Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Penix Jr. The two have been inseparable since his early college days.

Fred Warner injury shakes the core of 49ers’ defense



Shanahan and teammates rally around Fred Warner’s leadership



An MRI confirmed the worst fears for the San Francisco 49ers — star linebacker Fred Warner suffered a fractured and dislocated right ankle. Head coach Kyle Shanahan announced that Warner will undergo season-ending surgery on Tuesday, effectively ending the defensive leader’s campaign and leaving a massive void in the heart of the 49ers’ defense.Fred Warner has long been the emotional and tactical anchor of San Francisco’s defense. He has missed just one game in his eight-year career, famously playing through a broken bone in his ankle last season. Losing him now, after a 30-19 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, is a crushing blow for a 49ers team already without Nick Bosa.Shanahan remains cautiously optimistic about Warner’s recovery. “I think, usually, things like this are around three months,” Shanahan said. “But I assume he’ll be good for the offseason workouts and stuff like that.”Still, the loss changes everything. Warner isn’t just a linebacker — he’s the quarterback of the defense, the one who directs traffic and sets the tone. “A ‘Mike’ linebacker directs the traffic just like a center or quarterback,” Shanahan explained. “You don’t have corners making the calls on your front and knowing where strengths and pressures come from.”In Warner’s absence, linebacker Tatum Bethune will step in. He showed promise with a team-high 10 tackles against Tampa Bay but also allowed a 34-yard touchdown that Shanahan admitted Warner likely would have prevented. It’s a tough position for Bethune, who now inherits both Warner’s responsibilities and expectations.Even while facing surgery, Warner stayed true to form — steady, humble, and team-first. He addressed teammates in the locker room and shared a heartfelt message with fans on Instagram. Shanahan couldn’t hide his admiration: “Not only is he as impressive as a football player I’ve been around, but as impressive a human as I’ve been around. You read how he’s looking at this, and it’s as real as can be. That’s why we know he’ll come back next year stronger than ever. ”The 49ers now face an uncertain path. Sitting at 4-2, they’ll need resilience and discipline to stay in the playoff hunt. “The reality is we lost another really good player,” Shanahan said. “What are we going to do about it? What type of team are we going to be going forward?”That’s the question lingering over Levi’s Stadium — and only time will tell if San Francisco can withstand the loss of its heart and soul, Fred Warner.Also Read: Who is Michael Penix Jr.’s fiancée Olivia Carter?

Travis Kelce hints at a WWE crossover with The Rock’s encouragement



Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson may have built a billion-dollar empire through Hollywood and wrestling, but deep down, he admits his heart once belonged to football. During a new episode of the New Heights podcast with Jason and Travis Kelce, the former WWE icon shared a rare moment of vulnerability, confessing that he once dreamed of living the very life the Kelce brothers now lead.Dwayne Johnson’s journey to superstardom wasn’t always lined with fame and fortune. Before conquering wrestling and film, he was chasing an NFL dream that never materialized. Reflecting on that chapter, he told the Kelce brothers, “I wanted your life. I wanted to be in the NFL. That was my goal, and it wound up being the best thing that actually never happened for me.”Before becoming “The Rock,” Johnson had a short-lived career in the Canadian Football League, where he struggled to find footing after going undrafted by the NFL. That disappointment, he says, ultimately redirected his ambition toward wrestling, a move that not only defined his legacy but made him one of the most recognizable figures in entertainment history.Still, his admiration for athletes like Jason and Travis runs deep. The brothers have built what Johnson calls “a legacy that defines brotherhood and excellence.” Jason, a retired Eagles center, has seamlessly transitioned into a major media voice, while Travis continues to dominate the NFL as one of the Kansas City Chiefs’ most valuable offensive weapons.In a lighthearted twist, Johnson asked Travis if he’d ever step into the wrestling ring. Without hesitation, Kelce said, “When the opportunity presents itself, you know, I’ll dive in there! I’ve been dreaming about this, been working on my moves in the living room for years trying to get my chance.”With his charisma, physicality, and fan-favorite charm, Kelce seems tailor-made for the WWE spotlight, a sentiment The Rock seemed to share. The conversation offered more than nostalgia; it was a full-circle moment where two worlds, football and wrestling collided through mutual respect, ambition, and the enduring belief that sometimes, the dreams that don’t come true can lead to even greater ones.Also Read: “We are not f**king fans of your boyfriend”: Swifties enraged and slam Taylor Swift over Travis Kelce’s signature on ‘The Life of a Showgirl’","Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson revealed on the New Heights podcast that his lifelong dream was to play in the NFL.

Oilers aim for fast start on challenging five-game road trip



Building momentum toward a Cup



The Edmonton Oilers are hitting the road for a five-game swing through the Metropolitan and Atlantic Divisions, just days after opening the season at home. With a lineup still settling in after training camp, the early road trip presents questions that are yet to be answered. Who will anchor the top line alongside Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl? How much playing time will backup goalie Calvin Pickard see? Most importantly, can the Oilers keep winning and avoid another early-season slump?After splitting their first two games, Edmonton sits at 1-0-1—a far better start than last season’s 0-3 or the 0-2 beginning the year before. While the sample size is small, the team is eager to turn early momentum into a strong foundation. After all, consecutive Stanley Cup final appearances have shown that slow starts can be costly.Reigning league-leading goal scorer Leon Draisaitl stressed the importance of early-season wins following a 3-1 victory over Vancouver. “You can build a lot of momentum and you can build a lot of confidence within your group if you get off to a good start,” he said. “You see it with a lot of teams, they get off to a really good start and then they just kind of carry it the rest of the way and they’re a playoff team.So, just give ourselves a better chance at that, and I think we’ll be good enough. ”Edmonton’s goal is simple: translate early victories into consistent performance that can sustain them through the Pacific Division grind. Every win now, however small it may seem, can add up later in the season. After narrowly losing back-to-back Stanley Cup finals, the Oilers understand the value of momentum, confidence, and even the smallest margins.Head coach Kris Knoblauch emphasized the team’s refreshed mindset heading into this season. “We’ve moved on from the previous season and playoffs, whatever happened,” he said. “Obviously, there’s still disappointment. But guys had done it once before, and (there is) no more feeling sore for ourselves. Let’s get to work. The attitude right from Day 1 has been upbeat, energetic.”While no one expects Edmonton to go 5-0 against the New York teams, New Jersey, Detroit, and Ottawa, the early road trip sets the tone. For a team that lost one Stanley Cup final by two goals and the next by two games, starting strong is more than symbolic—it’s essential. Every shift, every goal, and every win can contribute to a season-long push for the ultimate prize: bringing the Stanley Cup back to Edmonton.Also Read: Lane Hutson contract details: How much the Canadiens’ young star will earn from his massive new deal","Edmonton Oilers aim for fast start on challenging five-game road trip.

Bills safety Cole Bishop, defending in his hometown, attempted a diving tackle at the 45-yard line. Robinson, however, shook him off effortlessly and sprinted the remaining distance to the end zone. The touchdown wasn’t just a highlight reel moment—it showcased Robinson’s speed, vision, and balance.By halftime, Robinson had rushed for 138 yards on 12 carries and added 14 more on two receptions. This marked his 11th consecutive game with at least 90 yards from scrimmage, the longest active streak in the NFL. In a season already featuring three plays of 50 yards or more, Robinson has taken his game to a new level compared to last year.LeBron James, sidelined with sciatica but keeping tabs on Monday Night Football, celebrated the run on social media, writing, “Bijan so COLD!!!!!!!!! 🥶” His praise reflects the growing national recognition Robinson is earning for his electrifying style.Atlanta’s offense, powered by Robinson and Michael Penix Jr., has found new life this season. Robinson has rushed 64 times for 546 yards and four touchdowns through four games, adding 18 receptions for 270 yards and another score. His performance has helped Atlanta earn a solid RB Impact Score of 86.9 (B), ranking fifth among NFL rushers, while the team’s overall offense sits mid-table at 17th with an OFFi of 74.5.With the NFC South battle heating up, Robinson’s dominance gives Atlanta a legitimate shot at contending with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers or sneaking in as a Wild Card team. The Falcons’ upcoming schedule promises challenges, including games against Miami, New England, Indianapolis, and Carolina, making Robinson’s continued excellence crucial for Atlanta’s playoff hopes.Also Read: Tyler Biadasz’s soup stunt goes viral — Commanders center shows surprising reason behind the bizarre act","Atlanta Falcons running back Bijan Robinson ripped through the Buffalo Bills’ defense for an 81-yard touchdown.

Julie Hampton Cousins: From Georgia roots to NFL life



Family life and shared ventures



Kirk Cousins, now in his 13th NFL season, has taken on a new role as a backup quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons, a shift from his usual starting spot. While the move behind Michael Penix Jr. surprised many, Cousins’ journey off the field has been just as compelling. At the center of his life is his wife, Julie Hampton Cousins, whose support has been a steady anchor throughout his career. Their story blends love, family, and shared ambition, creating a partnership that has endured alongside the highs and lows of professional football.Born in 1989 in Alpharetta, Georgia, Julie Hampton grew up close to her family, alongside her two older brothers, Scott and Steve. She attended the University of Georgia, staying near her hometown before meeting Kirk through a mutual family friend in 2012, shortly after he was drafted into the NFL.Their connection was instant, and after 18 months of dating, Cousins proposed on a Capitol balcony. “I went down on a knee before it got too sappy, before it got too awkward. I don’t remember exactly what she said, but she said yes. That’s all I needed to hear,” he recalled to The Washington Post.The couple married in June 2014 in Atlanta, setting the foundation for a strong family life.Julie and Kirk have two sons, Cooper (born 2017) and Turner (born 2019), and a Labradoodle named Abe. Their home life combines the joys of parenting with shared commitments, including the Julie & Kirk Cousins Foundation. The charity collaborates with organizations like Bethany Christian Services, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and International Justice Mission, reflecting the couple’s dedication to giving back.In 2022, they expanded their partnership into business by purchasing the Clearbrook Golf Course in Saugatuck, Michigan. Beyond these ventures, the couple and their family have been featured in Netflix’s Quarterback, offering viewers a glimpse of their life off the field.Kirk has openly credited Julie for keeping him grounded, noting that he wears his wedding band even during games. Their relationship, built on early trust, mutual respect, and shared goals, stands as a testament to the power of partnership in both personal and professional spheres. Julie Hampton Cousins isn’t just the quarterback’s wife—she’s a devoted partner, mother, and philanthropist who has helped shape the life and career of one of the NFL’s notable players.Also Read: What happened to Josh Palmer?

Mohammed Siraj Press Conference: India pacer reflects on four-fer vs West Indies

NEW DELHI: The scorching Delhi heat proved too much for Indian pacer Mohammed Siraj , who dramatically collapsed from exhaustion during the second session on Day 4 of the second Test against the West Indies at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Monday. The alarming moment came after Siraj completed a grueling six-over spell post-lunch, pushing his physical limits under the punishing afternoon sun.Looking visibly drained, Siraj staggered into the Indian dugout and slumped onto a chair, prompting immediate medical attention from the team’s support staff. An ice pack was quickly placed on his head and face to lower his body temperature, while the physiotherapist massaged his feet to relax his muscles. The moment drew attention from all watching, though former India wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik lightened the mood, calling it “king-like treatment” on air.""What we see right now is the fast bowlers being treated like kings after a hard spell. It's the same case everywhere, by the way. I just need to let viewers know that it's not just on the ground, off the field, but also in the com box. We've got to be careful when you do that with Bish (Ian Bishop, who was also present in the commentary box), though. The ice (needs to be placed) straight on the head to calm him down at times. For Bish and for Siraj,"" Karthik said.The incident highlighted the brutal playing conditions as temperatures soared and India’s bowlers were made to toil.Earlier in the day, the West Indies resumed on 173/2 with overnight batters John Campbell and Shai Hope showing great resolve. Campbell converted his 87 into a maiden Test century, becoming the first West Indies opener to reach three figures since March 2023, while Hope followed with a ton of his own. The pair shared a commanding 177-run partnership before Ravindra Jadeja broke the stand.The visitors continued their fightback with captain Roston Chase contributing 40 runs and Justin Greaves completing his half-century to set India a target of 121 to complete the series sweep.For India, Kuldeep Yadav and Jasprit Bumrah took three wickets each to bowl out the Windies’ second innings for 390.West Indies had started Day 4 with a mountain to climb, forced to follow on after India declared at 518/5 and bowled them out for 248 in the first innings, securing a 270-run lead. Yet the visitors showed grit, and as their lead grew, so did the toll on India’s bowlers—none more visibly than on Siraj.",Mohammed Siraj collapsed from exhaustion during the second session on Day 4 of the second Test against the West Indies.

The Transformation

Two Bodies, One Soul





On June 12, two videos went viral. Both had a touch of the surreal. The first one was of a plane taking off, like planes routinely do, and then, within seconds, descending unhurriedly, unfathomably, like a giant suicidal bird. This couldn’t be real; except that it was. You could feel the heat and horror as the plane crashed into a building and became a ball of fire. These things don’t happen, till they do.The second video was equally surreal, maybe even more so. You can see black smoke curling up in greedy swirls, and the occasional tongue-lash of orange flames. This is the compound, about 1.7km from the Ahmedabad airport, where AI 171 had crashed within 40 seconds of takeoff. You can hear people screaming. You can hear sirens wailing. And then the screaming becomes even more hysterical. At the edge of the screen appears a figure, walking out of the black inferno. He is limping slightly. A man in a white tee and grey trousers. The cameras are zooming in on him. There’s some blood on his T-shirt. He’s holding a phone as he walks. He looks halfcrazed. He is saying something in Gujarati. The same thing over and over again.“Plane fatyo che ! Plane fatyo che ! (The plane has exploded.)”We had all seen the plane crash and explode, but coming from him, the words took on a different meaning. Because he was in the plane that exploded. There were 242 people on board the Dreamliner that day, including his brother Ajaykumar. Everyone else but him had died, some charred beyond recognition. And he was walking; bruised, but in his senses; sane enough to register that “Plane fatyo che !”That was four months ago. Everyone followed the story of 43-year-old Viswashkumar Ramesh’s miraculous survival in minute detail. Cameras chased him to Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, where he was admitted. His eyes were puffed, his left cheek badly bruised. But he spoke to reporters. He asked about his brother, who was dead. He met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who visited him. And then, after five days, he went home — to Diu.But if you try to reach Viswashkumar now, you will hit a wall. He won’t talk to anyone. Whenreporters reached his house in Diu two days ago, his father Ramesh Bhaliya said he had left for London a few days ago. In London, Viswashkumar has hired Radd Seiger and Sanjiv Patel as advisers and spokesmen. Seiger, who is a lawyer and a crisis strategy consultant, textedthat “we have nothing to say at this time”. He later also objected tohaving approached the family in Diu, saying “this is not the way and… they should not approach the family in Diu any further”.Viswash’s house is in Bhucharwada village, about 8km inland from Diu’s sandy beaches. Ramesh met these correspondents at the gate of his house. No one is invited in. The family, once known for their warmth and laughter, now lives behind closed doors.Ayub Usmani is an old friend of Viswash and his brother Ajay. “They loved company, loved parties,” says Usmani, who drove them to the airport to catch AI 171. “We were supposed to leave by 10pm on June 11 to catch the flight the next day. But the two partied and had so much fun that we got delayed by two hours. They were in a great mood — joking, talking, full of life.”And the irony is that Ajay wasn’t even supposed to be on that flight. “Viswash was the only one returning to London,” says Shantilal Bhikha, Ajay’s father-in-law. “Ajay decided at the last minute to join him. I wish he hadn’t.”In Bhucharwada, you realise how life can be transformed in the blink of an eye. And once transformed, how grief refuses to lift. “I wouldn’t wish this torment on my worst enemy,” says Viswash’s father Ramesh, standing at the gate of his house.Ramesh says Viswash now barely talks. He avoids calls. He left for London, probably in search of peace. “Only those who have suffered such a tragedy can understand this pain,” says Ramesh. “We have lost everything. I lost one son, and the other barely speaks. He is withdrawn. He does not even talk to his mother anymore.” Maybe distance will help him heal, he adds.Six weeks back, the family travelled back to the site of the crash, says Usmani. “They requested security to let them perform a small ritual. They go there again and again. It is their way of keeping Ajay close,” he said.Viswash is the eldest of Ramesh’s four sons. Ajay was the second eldest. And the two were very, very close. “They were inseparable… like ‘ do jism, ek jaan ’ (two bodies, one soul),” says Usmani.The brothers had lived in London for 15 years, running a garment business there and a fishing operation in Diu. Ajay had lost his two young daughters in 2021 and 2022. Viswash had been helping him cope.On the flight, Viswash was seated by the emergency exit in 11A. Ajay was in 11J. Luck, of the kind that no statistician can ever calculate, saved Viswash. Ajay stood no chance, like everyone else on that flight.Viswash would ask after his brother in the hospital. And then, once back home, would travel to Rajkot for therapy. His cousin Dhirendra Somabhai remembered how any talk of the crash would send him into panic. “He wanted to be alone most of the time.”Sometimes, surviving against all odds can also bring a sense of guilt. Viswash was seated by the exit in 11A. Ajay K., the kindest person one could know, checked on Viswash like everyone else would, asking about his hospital stay and how he was doing at home in Rajkot.","Vishwas Kumar Ramesh, 43, was the sole survivor of the Air India crash. His brother Ajaykumar was among the 242 people on board the plane. Viswashkumar has hired two London-based advisers and spokesmen. He barely talks to anyone and avoids calls for London.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124493645,imgsize-973663,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/viswash-occupant-of-seat-11a-staggered-out-in-the-moments-immediately-following-the-crash-right-viswash-at-the-funeral-of-his-brother-ajay-who-was-in-seat-11j.jpg"

Game details and how to watch

The Buffalo Bills are preparing for a crucial Week 6 Monday Night Football matchup against the Atlanta Falcons. With TE Dalton Kincaid being a key playmaker in the passing game, fans are asking: Will Kincaid suit up after an oblique injury, or will the Bills adjust their game plan without him?Dalton Kincaid is out for Monday’s game. He has been dealing with an oblique injury and has not been cleared to play. The Bills have officially listed him as out on the injury report, and the coaching staff is focusing on giving him enough recovery time to avoid further complications.Before his injury, Kincaid had been a reliable target for QB Josh Allen . Through five games this season, he has recorded 20 receptions for 287 yards and 3 touchdowns, averaging 14.4 yards per catch. His absence leaves a significant hole in the Bills’ tight end corps, especially with Dawson Knox expected to carry the primary load and Jackson Hawes providing depth.RB James Cook, who is fully healthy, may see an expanded role in the passing game to help balance the offense. QB Josh Allen is active and expected to start, meaning the Bills’ offensive plan will likely emphasize short passes, quick routes, and wide receiver involvement to mitigate the loss of Kincaid.Date: Monday, October 14, 2025Time: 7:15 PM ETVenue: Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta, GeorgiaTV/Stream: ESPNWhile Kincaid is out, his absence is a major test for the Bills’ tight end group. Dawson Knox and Jackson Hawes will need to step up in both the passing and blocking game, while Josh Allen may rely more heavily on his wide receivers and running backs to maintain offensive rhythm. Kincaid’s recovery will be closely monitored, and fans will be watching to see how Buffalo adapts without one of its key offensive weapons.Also read - Watch: Travis Kelce roasts Scott Van Pelt in the funniest post-game interview ever","The Buffalo Bills are preparing for a crucial Week 6 Monday Night Football matchup against the Atlanta Falcons.
