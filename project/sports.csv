Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

Poll Do you think Rohit Sharma should continue playing ODIs after his T20 retirement? No, it's time to retire. Yes, he should.

India's probable Test squad for England Tour

NEW DELHI: India‚Äôs white-ball captain Rohit Sharma has finally addressed questions surrounding his future in One Day Internationals (ODIs). In a candid conversation with senior journalist Vimal Kumar, Rohit made it clear that while he‚Äôs not done just yet, he‚Äôs very aware of when to walk away.The veteran opener emphasised his evolved approach to batting, saying, ""I used to play the way I used to, I took my time. Earlier, I would play 30 balls in the first 10 overs and be at just 10 runs. But if I play 20 balls now, why can't I score 30, 35, or even 40 runs? And on the days when I get going, hitting the accelerator, scoring 80 runs in the first 10 overs isn't bad at all. That's how I think now.""READ ALSO: 'Bekaar': Rohit Sharma makes shocking statement about naturally-gifted player ""I‚Äôve done it; I‚Äôve scored the runs I was meant to. Now, I want to play cricket in a different way. I‚Äôm not taking any of this for granted. Don‚Äôt assume that things will just keep going the same way, that I‚Äôll keep scoring 20 or 30 runs and just continue playing. The day I feel like I‚Äôm not able to do what I want to do on the field, I‚Äôll stop playing. That‚Äôs for sure. But right now, I know that what I‚Äôm doing is still helping the team,"" he added.READ ALSO: Rohit Sharma hits back at criticism: 'Defending myself is waste of time' Rohit has been a key pillar in India's ODI setup, with 11,168 runs in 273 matches at an impressive average of 48.76. Under his leadership, India clinched the T20 World Cup in 2024 and the Champions Trophy earlier this year, further cementing his legacy in white-ball cricket.While he called time on his T20 career after the Barbados final, the 37-year-old recently stepped away from Test cricket after an 11-year career, having played 67 Tests and scored 4,301 runs. His highest Test score, 212, came during a memorable series against South Africa in 2019.While he‚Äôs shut the door on red-ball cricket, just like his compatriot Virat Kohli, who hung his Test boots on Monday in an unexpected retirement call, both Kohli and Rohit remain committed to ODIs, for now. Perhaps the pair is keeping an eye on the upcoming 2027 ODI World Cup.Rohit‚Äôs message is clear: he‚Äôs still hungry, still driven, but when the moment comes to step aside, he‚Äôll do it on his own terms.","India's white-ball captain Rohit Sharma has addressed questions surrounding his future in One Day Internationals.

What‚Äôs Next for Golden State?

Theface an uncertain future after a challenging playoff run. Stephen Curry is nearing the end of his of his illustrious career and so is Draymond Green. Even though they acquired Jimmy Butler earlier this year, their path to the Western Conference could look bleak given the injuries that these players succumb to. Could a blockbuster move for a Lakers superstar change their fortunes next season? Sports Illustrated‚Äôs Alex Kirschenbaum recently suggested that the Golden State Warriors might pursue Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James this offseason. James, a four-time NBA champion, could provide Golden State with much-needed frontcourt size and experience.Kirschenbaum noted: ""(LeBron) James has long been linked to Golden State, in part because his rivalry against Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Draymond Green (they've played each other in five playoff series, during which James has gone 2-3) eventually blossomed into a bromance.""However, age and injury concerns loom large. A potential lineup featuring James (39), Curry (37), Jimmy Butler (35), and Draymond Green (34) would raise questions about durability.According to Caleb Hightower of the Sporting News 1. Championship Pedigree: James brings unmatched playoff experience and leadership.2. Fit with Curry: Their contrasting skill sets could create an unstoppable offensive duo.3. Lakers‚Äô Struggles: With L.A. failing to advance past the first round, James may seek a new challenge.- Injury Risks: James, Curry, and Butler all dealt with significant injuries this postseason.- Contract Hurdles: James holds a $52.6 million player option, complicating any trade or signing.- Lakers‚Äô Plans: His commitment to playing alongside Luka Donƒçiƒá could keep him in Los Angeles.If the Warriors exit the playoffs early and seek a roster shakeup, James could emerge as a high-risk, high-reward target.

Auston Matthews‚Äô hockey dream wasn‚Äôt cheap and his mom took the weight

‚ÄúI used to work in the morning for Starbucks, in the afternoon the restaurant, i was very fortunate to have two jobs. And believe me, if they would have more hours, I would have more jobs.""





Before Auston Matthews was an NHL superstar, his biggest supporter was clocking into two jobs, trying to make ends meet. His mom, Ema Matthews , didn‚Äôt just believe in his dream, she bankrolled it, penny by penny, from behind a Starbucks counter. For families without deep pockets, hockey can be financially brutal. But Ema‚Äôs resilience turned obstacles into opportunity and her son into one of the league‚Äôs brightest stars. Her story is the heartwarming reminder that every great athlete often has a real-life superhero cheering from the sidelines.Ice time, gear, coaching, travel, youth hockey isn‚Äôt just a sport, it‚Äôs a financial beast. For the Matthews family, especially with Ema being originally from Hermosillo, Mexico, the culture and cost of the sport were both daunting. But she took on the challenge without hesitation, picking up multiple jobs including a gig at Starbucks to ensure Auston never missed a chance to grow on the ice.Ema shared in a past interview that the cost of hockey often reached up to $20,000 a year, a heavy ask for any middle-class family. To make it work, she didn‚Äôt just cut corners, she picked up shifts and poured lattes while helping Auston stay focused on the sport. She even deposited small amounts of money in his account so he could grab food with teammates like a regular teen.Ema‚Äôs story also breaks stereotypes. In a sport dominated by players from Canada and northern U.S. states, Auston‚Äôs rise as a player of Mexican heritage makes his success even more impactful. It's not just about talent, it‚Äôs about trailblazing, especially for kids of color or immigrant families who rarely see themselves represented in hockey.Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs ‚Äô biggest stars and a face of the NHL. He‚Äôs not just known for his goal-scoring skills but also for his poise and work ethic, traits his mom likely helped instill.

Vomiting after head contact sparks concern from medical experts

As the Toronto Maple Leafs prepare for a critical Game 5 in their second-round playoff clash against the Florida Panthers, attention has shifted to the troubling injury situation surrounding goaltender Anthony Stolarz . Sidelined since suffering an upper-body injury in Game 1, the 31-year-old netminder‚Äôs status remains uncertain‚Äîand now, an NHL analyst is sounding the alarm on the nature of his symptoms.Anthony Stolarz sustained the injury during Toronto‚Äôs 5-4 Game 1 victory on May 5, following what appeared to be two separate hits to the head: a blistering shot from Sam Reinhart and a forearm to the side of the head by Sam Bennett. While the team has not confirmed the exact cause, the visible effects raised immediate concern.Speaking on TSN‚Äôs ‚ÄúFirst Up,‚Äù NHL analyst Dave Feschuk highlighted the gravity of Stolarz‚Äôs condition. ‚ÄúThe problem is... vomiting on the bench after a head hit, or potentially two head hits... That‚Äôs not normal concussion symptoms ,‚Äù said Feschuk. ‚ÄúIt could mean it was a more serious thing that we don't know what it is.‚ÄùCiting conversations with concussion specialists, Feschuk emphasized that vomiting post-impact isn‚Äôt commonly associated with standard concussion cases.‚ÄúThese guys... were very concerned that the vomiting thing, you know, it could indicate something more serious than a concussion. And obviously, a concussion is very serious, so who knows where Anthony Stolarz is at.‚ÄùDespite the alarming concerns, there was a sliver of optimism when Stolarz returned to the ice for light activity before team practice on Tuesday. Head coach Craig Berube provided a cautious update: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs doing much better,‚Äù Berube said. ‚ÄúBut no timeline for his return.‚ÄùStolarz is in his first season with the Leafs after signing a two-year, $5 million contract in the offseason.

Stephen Curry will miss Game 5 against the Minnesota Timberwolves



The Golden State Warriors are on the verge of elimination, and they‚Äôll have to face the remaining high-stakes game without their biggest weapon. Stephen Curry has officially been ruled out of Game 5 against the Minnesota Timberwolves as he continues to recover from a Grade 1 hamstring strain suffered during the second quarter of Game 1. Warriors head coach Steve Kerr recently confirmed that Curry will miss Game 5 as he is not medically cleared.Stephen Curry‚Äôs absence was confirmed by Anthony Slater of The Athletic, who posted on X sharing the update, ""Steph Curry is out tomorrow for Game 5 in Minnesota. The Warriors officially face elimination without their star guard."" As the Minnesota Timberwolves lead the series 3-1 and the Warriors are playing on the road with a thin red line from elimination.Curry‚Äôs absence is especially painful considering the timing. Golden State took Game 1 despite Curry‚Äôs early exit, but has since dropped three straight games. The offense has sputtered without the two-time MVP, and while others like Jonathan Kuminga and Brandin Podziemski have shown their playmaking abilities on the court, replicating Curry‚Äôs presence and production has proven close to impossible.Speaking with 95.7, Warriors head coach shared, ‚ÄúJimmy was under the weather last night. He really was not feeling well and that definitely impacted him‚Ä¶ Everyone knows who Jimmy is. He's one of the great playoff performers and I expect him to have a big game tomorrow.""Curry addressed his condition ahead of Game 5, telling ESPN‚Äôs Marc Spears: ""Even if I wanted to be Superman, I couldn't."" The quote was in reference to teammate Draymond Green‚Äôs earlier comment where he emphasized the team wouldn‚Äôt try to ""Superman this thing."" Green added, ""If he‚Äôs in a place where he can play, I‚Äôm sure he will.""But the reality is, Curry is still not ready. According to NBA insider Shams Charania, Curry‚Äôs progress over the weekend was limited to jogging and some light jump shooting. ‚ÄúUntil you get to that point, there‚Äôs not like a safe way to bring him back from a hamstring injury,‚Äù Charania explained.While Curry has traveled with the team, head coach Kerr confirmed he won‚Äôt suit up for Wednesday‚Äôs do-or-die contest. However, if the Warriors manage to steal Game 5 on the road, there‚Äôs a silver lining.

Mounting injury crisis threatens Tottenham Hotspur's European dream

Captain Son returns as Postecoglou faces tactical reshuffle

The bid of Tottenham Hotspur for European glory has received a massive blow after the creative midfielder Dejan Kulusevski went under the knife in a patella surgery days before their Europa League final clash with Manchester United. The Swedish international player picked up the injury while playing for Tottenham Hotspur against Crystal Palace in the Premier League last weekend when he came off the pitch after 19 minutes of play. The development comes as a major headache for manager Ange Postecoglou , who now has a huge decision to make going into the club‚Äôs biggest game in years.The 25-year-old Kulusevski has played a major role for Tottenham Hotspur this season, scoring 10 goals and setting up 11 goals in 50 games in all competitions. His absence is adding to Tottenham Hotspur‚Äôs woes, as they have already seen midfield playmakers James Maddison and Lucas Bergvall sidelined with knee and ankle troubles, respectively, for the rest of the campaign.Dejan Kulusevski had gotten injured in the recent Premier League match against Crystal Palace, according to the confirmation by Tottenham Hotspur. After consultation with a medical professional, the Swedish international has gone under the knife and will now start his rehabilitation process under the watchful eyes of the club‚Äôs medical staff.This is the second serious injury blow to Dejan Kulusevski this season, as he had missed seven matches earlier this year with a foot problem in March. Of special worry to the Tottenham Hotspur fans is the timing, as Kulusevski had just-recently found form, playing a key role during the game‚Äôs most crucial Europa League semi-finals against Eintracht Frankfurt and Bodo/Glimt that saw them qualify for the finals.The only bright spot for Tottenham Hotspur has been the return of captain Heung-Min Son from his own foot injury. The South Korean forward, who has not won any trophy with the North London club in ten trophy-less seasons, finds the final a way of completing his Tottenham Hotspur ‚Äúpuzzle‚Äù.Addressing an interview before the forthcoming final of the Europa League, Son Heung-min confessed that winning a major trophy has been the thing lacking in his career for the last decade. ‚ÄúIt feels like I‚Äôve been looking for that last missing piece for the last 10 years,‚Äù Son said. ‚ÄúThis time feels different. I really want to win it ‚Äî maybe more than anybody else.‚ÄùPostecoglou is likely to pair Rodrigo Bentancur, Yves Bissouma, and Pape Matar Sarr in the midfield against Manchester United, but Wilson Odobert is another alternative, even though he flopped when he replaced Kulusevski against Crystal Palace.The Tottenham Hotspur fans will get a chance to see their team try and win their first major trophy since the year 2008 when they face off against Manchester United on Wednesday, May 21, at San Mames Stadium, Bilbao.

With both Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma retiring from Test cricket, India's roadmap to the 2027 ICC Cricket World Cup enters a new phase. The legendary duo, who have served Indian cricket across formats for over a decade, will now focus solely on One-Day Internationals in the build-up to the next 50-over World Cup, to be hosted by South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia in October‚ÄìNovember 2027.India are set to play 27 ODIs across nine bilateral series against eight different nations before the tournament, offering both veterans ample match time to prepare for what could be their final World Cup appearances.Virat Kohli recently announced his retirement from Test cricket through a social media post, ending a red-ball career that spanned 123 matches and 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85. He also stepped away from T20 Internationals earlier this year, but remains committed to ODIs ‚Äî the format in which he was the highest run-scorer in the 2023 World Cup held in India.Rohit Sharma, who had already stepped away from T20Is after captaining India to the 2024 T20 World Cup title, confirmed that he will carry on in the 50-over format. Speaking recently, he stated,making his intentions clear ahead of what could be his final World Cup campaign.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? With both stalwarts moving on from the longer formats, India will rely on their experience to guide a younger core of players through the next ODI cycle.India's lead-up to the World Cup will include six home series and three overseas tours, allowing them to face varied opposition in different conditions. This sequence of games will also help the selectors assess combinations and build squad depth.If fit, both Kohli and Rohit could play in most of the 27 scheduled matches, balancing form, workload, and leadership roles. Even appearing in 20‚Äì22 games would allow them to contribute meaningfully while guiding emerging talent through this important phase.The next two years will be about transition, but also about legacy ‚Äî with India's two greatest modern ODI batters preparing for one final shot at World Cup glory in southern Africa.","Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have retired from Test cricket.

Max Scherzer's thumb injury continues to hamper recovery

Blue Jays explore alternatives amid Max Scherzer's absence

The Toronto Blue Jays‚Äô 2025 season has been dealt a major blow as the veteran right-hander Max Scherzer‚Äôs return has been delayed. Max Scherzer, a three-time Cy Young Award winner, has been out since he made his season debut on March 29 but could not pitch effectively with inflammation in his right thumb. Although there was hope for a quick return, Scherzer‚Äôs rehabilitation took longer than anticipated, and now he fears he might not play again this season.Scherzer‚Äôs thumb problems have been a lingering issue since spring training and have been impacting both his grip and overall arm health. He has described the thumb as ‚Äúabsolutely critical to your arm health‚Äù and said it was essential to correct the problem instead of attempting to pitch through it. Scherzer attempted to begin throwing again after getting a second cortisone injection in April, but still felt pain, especially after throwing around 50 pitches. His only outing this season was a three-inning start against the Baltimore Orioles in which he allowed two solo shots before leaving because of right lat soreness, a complication stemming from the thumb issue.The Blue Jays need pitching help with Scherzer hitting the 60-day injury list. They have considered internal candidates like Yariel Rodriguez, but are also looking outside the organization. The Blue Jays are rumored to be interested in picking up Mitch Keller of the Pittsburgh Pirates‚Äìa great pitcher who has put up numbers, as a replacement for Scherzer. Keller is pitching like a stud, and with his value at $77 million, it makes him a very nice trade candidate for Toronto if they want to stay competitive in the AL East.Max Scherzer‚Äôs rehabilitation will be progressed cautiously, and the earliest he can return is May 29. The Blue Jays hope he can help them later in the year, but his availability and readiness will determine that. In the meantime, Toronto‚Äôs front office has to make adjustments, bolstering its pitching staff to make way through the season without one of its top off-season additions.While Scherzer cannot be out there, he remains a leader in the clubhouse. The staff appreciates his leadership role and his ability to mentor the team's young pitchers, even in the run-up to the 18th inning of a game. Despite what he brought to the field, Max Scherzer‚Äôs impact off the field could yet prove pivotal as the Blue Jays fight to remain in playoff position.Also Read: Max Scherzer seen mocking umpire C.B.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

Poll What do you think is Virat Kohli's greatest achievement as a Test captain? Winning the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia Leading India to the top Test ranking Highest run scorer among captains Most Test matches won

Runs alongside captaincy armband

Virat Kohli's retirement announcement created quite the stir on Monday, even if it did feel like coming to some. Over the past few days, as TimesofIndia.com had reported, the right-hander had hinted at stepping away in Australia. Yet, he harboured hopes of leading in England with Rohit Sharma stepping down a couple of days ago. When that bid was turned down, with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) opting for Shubman Gill, the writing was on the wall.""As I step away from this format, it‚Äôs not easy ‚Äî but it feels right. I‚Äôve given it everything I had, and it‚Äôs given me back so much more than I could‚Äôve hoped for,"" wrote 36-year-old Kohli on Instagram.""I‚Äôll always look back at my Test career with a smile. #269, signing off,"" he added.With Kohli retiring, India lost not just a mainstay at No. 4 spot - a position that had Sachin Tendulkar first and Kohli next for over three decades - but one of the batting forces.Sure, his powers were on the decline in the last couple of years, but his overall tally of 9,230 runs puts him in fourth place among India's highest Test scorers. The list is helmed by Sachin Tendulkar (15,921 runs), Rahul Dravid (13,265 runs) and Sunil Gavaskar (10,122 runs).Above and beyond the pure run-scoring, Kohli's leadership skills is another aspect that will be sorely missed. He might not have led the team since 2022, but his presence, animated gestures and pumped up energy could not be ignored. Even in what turned out to be his last Test in Sydney, Kohli led the lines with Rohit Sharma not in the playing XI and Jasprit Bumrah off the field due to injury.Kohli‚Äôs relentless and assertive leadership, propelled India to become the top-ranked Test team. When India won the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 2018-19, Kohli became the first Asian captain to record a series win Down under. That was followed by a 2-1 series lead in England, which eventually finished 2-2 after a COVID-19 break.Beyond the passion and intensity, the statistics also reveal a story that aligns with what‚Äôs visible ‚Äî Kohli was undeniably the best Indian captain and stood out among his peers.As captain (2014-2022), Kohli racked up numbers that make him India's most successful Test captain. He led India in 68 matches, winning 40, losing 17 and drawing 11. Under him, India had a winning rate of 58.8% . Among Indian captains who led in at least 10 matches, that is the best number. Behind Kohli are Rohit Sharma (50%), MS Dhoni (45%), Sourav Ganguly (43%) and Rahul Dravid (32%).In terms of absolute numbers, India triumphed in 40 matches with Kohli wearing the captaincy armband. It was followed by Dhoni (27), Ganguly (21), Mohammad Azharuddin (14) and Rohit Sharma (12).Even at a global stage, Kohli's leadership numbers match up to the greats of the game. Of captains with at least 50 Test matches, only seven have a win percentage above 50%. Besides Kohli, this list features Graeme Smith, Ricky Ponting, Steve Waugh, Hansie Cronje, Michael Vaughan, Sir Viv Richards, and Mark Taylor.If you zoom in to his records, Kohli also led India to most matches won at home. He played a crucial role in India's unbeaten streak at home that ran from 2012 until 2024.Kohli-led India triumphed in 24 Tests of 31 played on home soil, only fewer than Smith's South Africa (30 wins in 53) and Ponting (29 wins in 39).Among Indians, MS Dhoni had won 21 home Tests ahead of Azharuddin (13) and Ganguly, Rohit (10).Another challenging aspect of a Test captain is to keep the flow of runs going. Even if they wear the captain's armband, the runs or wickets column cannot dry up. That is a hallmark of great players who become even greater leaders. And Kohli ticked both boxes during his captaincy reign.Despite the extra pressure, Kohli was the highest run scorer among the Indian Test captains. He scored 5864 runs as India Test captain, including 20 centuries and 18 fifties at an average of 54.80. His highest Test score - 254 against South Africa - came when he was the skipper.It is worth highlighting that 63% of Kohli's career Test runs came when he was captain of the Indian cricket team.Behind him in the list stand Dhoni (3454 runs), Sunil Gavaskar (3449 runs), Azharuddin (2856 runs) and Ganguly (2561). When looked at it from a batting average perspective, Kohli, once again, leads the charts followed by Tendulkar (51.35), Gavaskar (50.72), Dravid (44.51) and Azharuddin (43.93).Once again, when pitted against captains from all over the world, Kohli was right up there. The 36-year-old scored 20 centuries as Test captain, which is the second-most after Graeme Smith (28).He also scored seven double centuries - most among all captains. His 5864 Test runs as captain is the fourth-highest for any player, behind Smith (8659 runs), Border (6623) and Ponting (6542).Among Indian captains, Kohli scored the most runs on home soil. His 2907 runs from 31 matches, at an average of 67.60, is more than Gavaskar (2426), Dhoni (1863), MAK Pataudi (1481) and Azharuddin (1339).As Kohli walks off into the sunset, India will be poorer at No. 4, with the runs on the scorecard, the charged up attitude and the leadership, even if he had let go of the armband three years ago.","Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years as a player and captain. He led India in 68 matches, winning 40, losing 17 and drawing 11. Under him, India had a winning rate of 58.8%.

Jason Kelce mocks 'America‚Äôs Team' as Travis Kelce questions Dak Prescott‚Äôs health

In a fiery lead-up to the 2025 NFL season opener, Philadelphia Eagles legend Jason Kelce and his brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, ignited controversy by mocking the Dallas Cowboys and raising doubts about quarterback Dak Prescott's readiness to return. Their remarks, made during their popular ‚ÄúNew Heights‚Äù podcast, have added fuel to an already heated rivalry as the Eagles prepare to host the Cowboys on September 4.Jason Kelce, who retired earlier this year, didn‚Äôt hold back when taking a jab at the Cowboys‚Äô long-standing nickname, ""America‚Äôs Team."" ""Some still call them America‚Äôs Team, but it‚Äôs been a long time since they‚Äôve lived up to that,"" he said.Meanwhile, Travis Kelce turned the focus to the Cowboys‚Äô biggest question mark heading into the season Dak Prescott.The quarterback missed the second half of the 2024 season due to a partial hamstring avulsion, and while he has expressed confidence in his recovery, his actual readiness remains uncertain.""Is my guy Dak going to be back?"" Travis asked during the podcast, casting doubt on Prescott's condition and stirring speculation among fans and analysts alike.Prescott, in previous interviews, claimed he could play if necessary and expects to be ready for the season opener. However, he has yet to confirm his participation definitively, and the Cowboys have not released any official update on his game-day status.Given the Eagles‚Äô top-ranked defense and the emotionally charged environment expected at Lincoln Financial Field, Prescott‚Äôs potential return is under intense scrutiny. The Cowboys face immense pressure not only from their division rivals but also from years of postseason frustration and unmet expectations.The Eagles, by contrast, are riding high after a championship season and will enter Week 1 with momentum and a roster that remains largely intact. The game promises to set the tone for both teams' seasons.Jason Kelce‚Äôs retirement has not diminished his influence, as his comments continue to resonate across the league.With Travis Kelce adding his voice to the mix, the Kelce brothers have successfully stirred the pot ahead of what‚Äôs shaping up to be one of the most anticipated season openers in recent memory.Also read: NFL trade rumors: Could the Cowboys trade Dak Prescott?

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee ‚Äî Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match ‚Äî before the Nagpur ODI ‚Äî more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‚ÄòHitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

What‚Äôs the tile game Meghan Markle played on Netflix? A beginner‚Äôs guide to mahjong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/whats-the-tile-game-meghan-markle-played-on-netflix-a-beginners-guide-to-mahjong/articleshow/120736644.cms,"Meghan Markle played the game of Mahjong in her Netflix series

From the Qing dynasty to pop culture

How is mahjong played?

Connor Wan, a 29-year-old British-Chinese artist, learned mahjong while visiting family in Hong Kong. He enjoyed it so much that he started the Four Winds Mahjong Club in London, and later brought it to Toronto after moving there in 2024. ‚ÄúMoving countries is hard, especially when you don‚Äôt know anyone,‚Äù he said. The club became popular quickly, not as a place for gambling, but for making friends and celebrating Asian culture. Nicole Wong, a writer and audio producer from California, started playing mahjong as a teenager with her grandparents. She later began The Mahjong Project in 2019 to share the game‚Äôs cultural stories and organise pop-up game nights. This year, she published a book called Mahjong: House Rules from Across the Asian Diaspora. Nicole says the sound of the tiles is especially powerful. ‚ÄúMahjong is more than just fun,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt has a deep history and brings back strong memories.‚Äù In Toronto, Robyn Feldberg has taught over 250 people how to play mahjong through her courses. She donates all the money‚Äîabout $50,000 so far‚Äîto charities like Save A Child‚Äôs Heart. She says the game is especially popular with young mothers who want a fun way to relax and connect with others. ‚ÄúThey tell me, ‚ÄòWe want something that‚Äôs just for us,‚Äô‚Äù she said.

A centuries-old Chinese game called mahjong is having a modern revival across continents, from luxury cruise ships and trendy hotel lounges to Meghan Markle‚Äôs Netflix series.In the sixth episode of her docuseries With Love, the Duchess of Sussex invites friends for a cosy game night ‚Äì playing mahjong, reports the Globe and Mail.The four-person tile-based game, traditionally associated with Chinese culture, is now catching on with new generations across the globe. ‚ÄúThe game itself is really so fun,‚Äù says Markle. ‚ÄúBut what was so great was the idea of learning something new with your friends, together... the mahjong becomes the background of the expansion of friendship. It‚Äôs the feeling of community.‚ÄùMahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China. Traditionally played with 144 tiles, the game blends skill, strategy and a touch of luck. Players pick and discard tiles to form winning hands, much like the card game rummy.The game‚Äôs expansion across the world has now erupted into a full-blown trend. The World Mahjong Championship was recently held in Mississauga, Ontario ‚Äì the first time it‚Äôs been hosted in North America. Hotels such as the Ace Hotel New York and Thompson Hotel Dallas regularly hold mahjong-themed nights.Fans with money to spare are buying fancy mahjong sets from Herm√®s, Louis Vuitton, and Ralph Lauren. Some are even splashing out on luxury tables that shuffle the tiles automatically ‚Äì costing over $4,500.Even cruise ships have joined the trend, offering mahjong tournaments and special rooms just for playing the game.Mahjong is played with 144 tiles. Players begin by shuffling the tiles face down. Everyone rolls dice and the highest roller becomes the dealer. Each player picks 36 tiles and builds a wall‚Äîtwo rows of 18 tiles. The walls are pushed forward, creating a space in the middle for discards. Each player then draws 13 tiles (the dealer starts with 14), and the game begins.Players take turns drawing one tile and discarding one, always keeping 13 tiles in hand. You can draw a new tile or pick up someone‚Äôs discarded one. If a discarded tile helps complete a set (called a meld), you can grab it, announce the set, and show the tiles. To win, a player must have four melds (like three or four matching tiles or a sequence of three in a suit) and one pair (two matching tiles)‚Äîmaking 14 tiles total.There are five types of tiles: Bamboo, Characters, Dots (these are the three main suits), and special tiles called Honors (Dragons and Winds) and Bonus (Flowers and Seasons). Each suit goes from 1 to 9. Honors and Bonus tiles add extra excitement but aren't needed to win. Mahjong mixes strategy and memory with a bit of luck‚Äîand it‚Äôs all about building the right sets before your opponents do.For many mahjong fans, it‚Äôs not just a game but a deeply social experience.","Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China.

Uncertainty over Punjab Kings players

Australia opener Jake Fraser-McGurk will not be coming for the remainder of IPL 2025 , which will restart on May 17. The Delhi Capitals opener is still 'shaken up' after the Punjab Kings vs Delhi Capitals fixture in Dharamsala was halted midway due to security reasons . Mustafizur Rahman has already been named as his replacement.""I‚Äôm honestly not sure. He is still tossing up a decision. I spoke to him this morning, and he is still unsure,"" Shanon Young, coach of Fraser-McGurk, told TimesofIndia.com.Young, who was in Dharamsala, revealed that despite how well the Delhi Capitals management handled the situation, it was too much to handle for the 23-year-old.""He was shaken more than most. Not surprising given he is the youngest of the tourists, and he was quite uneasy the day before the game and then obviously after we were evacuated and then the subsequent trip back to Delhi,"" Young shared.""He wasn‚Äôt in a good way, and I am very thankful I was there to help guide him through that. It was hard enough for a 50-year-old well-travelled man, let alone a kid.""The Delhi Capitals staff and organisation as a whole were amazing and always had our safety as paramount as soon as all this happened. They really were incredible in a time of uncertainty,"" he added.Delhi Capitals will play their next match on Sunday against Gujarat Titans at the Arun Jaitley Stadium.Delhi Capitals have signed Bangladesh seamer Mustafizur Rahman as Jake Fraser-McGurk's replacement. Mustafizur Rahman has so far played 57 IPL matches and has 61 wickets against his name. He has played 106 T20Is for Bangladesh, picking up 132 wickets from the same. The left-arm medium pacer will join Delhi Capitals for Rs 6 Crore.It is also understood that left-arm quick Mitchell Starc is all set to pull out from the IPL 2025 as well.Australia's women's cricket team captain and Mitchell Starc's partner, Alyssa Healy, who was also there in Dharamsala, revealed in a podcast how panic gripped the overseas players of both the teams.""We weren't sure what was going to unfold in the next three days because all the Northern airports were shut,"" Healy said on the Willow Talk podcast.""Everything you heard was different. So what was actually taking place? No one really knew. Even the governments weren't really sure what was going on because no one could really understand unless you were quite literally living in these villages that were getting attacked.""So I think that probably created more of the anxiety. I think there was a lot of talk around why we shouldn't be playing. It's not a great time to be playing, first and foremost, but also we're quite close to what's being fought over.""A couple of days ago, Punjab Kings CEO Satish Menon was convinced that their Australian contingent, including Marcus Stoinis, Josh Inglis, Xavier Bartlett, and Aaron Hardie, who returned home, would return.However, it is now understood that they, too, are unwilling to come back. Punjab will take on Rajasthan Royals on Sunday at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur.It is also reliably learned that head coach Ricky Ponting, who stepped out after boarding the flight once he heard the announcement of a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, is trying to convince the Australian players to return to India.The Punjab Kings contingent reached Jaipur on Wednesday and will resume their training from Thursday.","Delhi Capitals have signed Bangladesh seamer Mustafizur Rahman as Jake Fraser- McGurk's replacement.

Melinda French Gates‚Äô dream which changed her life

Melinda Gates says she suffered panic attacks

Microsoft founder Bill Gates ex-wife Melinda French Gates has revealed that a recurring dream played an important role in her decision to end her 27-year marriage. The divorce, which was finalised in 2021, followed the surfacing of certain information that impacted the couple's relationship. In a recent interview French Gates revealed that she experienced recurring nightmares in late 2019. She claimed that the dream turned out be a turning point in her journey.In an interview with enterprenuer Jamie Kern Lima, French Gates described her symbolic dream. Melinda Gates described that in her dream, she saw that she was standing on a cliff along with Bill gates and their children. As the dream progressed, the portion of the cliff where she stood began to crumble and break away. This imagery had a profound effect on her, which she interpreted as a clear sign that she needed to separate and move forward on her own.‚ÄúI was going to have to make a decision‚Äîand I was going to have to make it by myself,‚Äù she recalled.""Some dreams will take me years to understand, but if they‚Äôre recurring, I know I need to pay attention to them,‚Äù added Melinda Gates.While the dream served as a catalyst, Melinda's decision was also influenced by other factors. While she did not disclose specific details, Melinda acknowledged that certain things came out publicly, reinforcing her decision to leave the marriage. She referenced Bill Gates‚Äô past meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, which she described as deeply disturbing. Bill has previously admitted that associating with Epstein was a mistake.In a recent candid interview with The Times, French Gates addressed Bill Gates‚Äô remarks about their divorce. She said, ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt live your values out inside your most intimate relationship, it was necessary.‚ÄùFrench Gates also opened up about the emotional strain of the divorce, sharing that she experienced panic attacks throughout the separation. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre leaving a marriage, it‚Äôs very, very hard. And the negotiations were tough,‚Äù she said.She shared that her first panic attack occurred in 2014 while having lunch with Gates, prompting her to begin therapy. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd heard of people having panic attacks and I didn‚Äôt know if it was a real thing,‚Äù she said.Initially skeptical of therapy, French Gates admitted she later came to understand its value. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm damaged,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúIt means I‚Äôve been through some difficult things that I need to figure out.‚ÄùFollowing the divorce, both Bill and Melinda Gates have continued their philanthropic efforts, though they are no longer working together as a couple. Bill Gates has publicly expressed regret about the divorce, acknowledging his role in the dissolution of their marriage.",Melinda French Gates has revealed that a recurring dream played an important role in her decision to end her 27-year marriage to Bill Gates.

The latest Cricket South Africa (CSA) directive of recalling its IPL-bound players by May 26 has come as a body blow for the franchises, who will chase different goals upon the resumption of the league on Saturday. Making life more difficult for the teams is the impact that the England-West Indies ODI series, beginning May 29, could have on them as well.SA, slated to face Australia in the WTC final at Lord's in London from June 11, have reiterated their desire to bring the players back by the original deadline. ‚ÄúOur initial agreement with the IPL and the BCCI was that our players would return on May 26. As it stands, we are not budging on this,‚Äù SA coach Shukri Conrad said when asked about the extended IPL, which will run until June 3.Eight players picked in SA's 15-member WTC final squad, including Ryan Rickelton (Mumbai Indians), Kagiso Rabada (Gujarat Titans) and Marco Jansen (Punjab Kings), are contracted to IPL teams. SA are set to land in England on May 31 and play a four-day practice match against Zimbabwe from June 3, meaning their players are unlikely to feature in the playoffs.Meanwhile, Cricket Australia (CA) has put the ball in the players' court, saying the team management will come up with fresh preparation plans for players ‚Äúwho choose to play‚Äù the rest of the IPL. Australia are scheduled to have a pre-final camp in Scotland from the end of this month, before travelling to England for the title clash. While Pat Cummins and Travis Head (both represent SRH who are eliminated) are likely to return, Josh Hazlewood (RCB) is set to give the final phase of IPL a miss.The Englishmen who have been named in the contingent for the home assignment against the West Indies are expected to fly out of India before the IPL playoffs. Among those selected are Jos Buttler (Titans), Will Jacks (Mumbai) and Jacob Bethell (Royal Challengers), leaving their top-four chasing franchises with lastminute work to do.The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), like the CSA, had provided assurance that its centrallycontracted players would be available for the entire IPL, but has been left with no other option because of the revised schedule. There is no clarity on whether Sherfane Rutherford (GT) and Romario Shepherd (RCB), picked in the Windies ODI squad, will stay for the playoffs in case their teams make the cut.The versatile wicketkeeper-batter will be badly missed as he has formed a nearperfect top-three with skipper Shubman Gill and B Sai Sudharsan. The top-order has done the bulk of the scoring for GT this campaign.The West Indian lends firepower to the Titans middleorder packed with uncapped Indians. He has delivered some crucial cameos and for now, GT do not have a like-forlike replacement in the squad, given Glenn Phillips too is out with injury.GT have performed well even in the absence of the ace South African pacer. If he doesn't return, Gerald Coetzee, who is not part of SA WTC Final squad, can take his place.The Englishman performed his duties after replacing the injured Phil Salt at the top of the order. With Salt expected to be back for the rest of the tournament ‚Äì as mentioned by batting coach Dinesh Karthik ‚Äì Bethell may not be much of a miss.The all-rounder has been a regular in the XII since the time he came in for the out-of-form Liam Livingstone. The West Indian played a match-winning knock against CSK. He reached Bengaluru late on Wednesday, ending all speculation.Could be the biggest miss. The Australian pacer has spearheaded the attack and been one of the standout bowlers this season. RCB do not have a quality back-up who can match the calibre of Hazlewood and may have to rely on Nuwan Thushara.Another probable big blow. The South African all-rounder has been the best-performing overseas player for Punjab. He picked up his bowling form, especially with the new ball, as the tournament progressed. Fast bowler Xavier Bartlett can replace him if the lanky paceman doesn't return.The Australian wicketkeeper-batter has been a floater in the line-up, but has not made a significant contribution yet. With Prabhsimran Singh being a mainstay, PBKS do not have an headache in the wicketkeeping department.Though not part of the WTC Final squad, there is a chance he may not return. The Aussie has not lived up to the expectations, barring the knock against SRH where he smashed four successive sixes. Azmatullah Omarzai, who broke back into the XII recently, can replace him.The southpaw has formed a formidable opening pair with Rohit Sharma and has been in fine nick. MI do not have an overseas replacement for him at the moment, neither do they have a wicketkeeper batter close to that quality.While the Englishman has not set the IPL on fire, he has been a utility player. With MI lacking a genuine off-spinner, he has chipped in with some crucial overs.The South African made it to the XII following the injury to leftarm spinner Mitchell Santner. Once Santner is back in the mix, Bosch may not be missed much.Though not part of WTC Final squad, opener has pulled out citing personal reasons. Poor returns from the Aussie opener meant that he was already dropped from the DC team with Faf du Plessis coming in place of him.The left-arm pacer lost steam in recent matches and did not provide the cutting edge at the start or death. Following his pull-out, Bangladesh's Mustafizur Rahman has been drafted in and he can be a decent back-up.The South African has been a vital cog in the Capitals wheel, taking up one of the toughest jobs of finishing the innings. His probable absence can be a massive blow for DC.They will not be missing any overseas players due to clash of schedules.Aiden Markram: The opener has been one of the top run-getters for LSG, who will need his services for all three remaining league matches if they are to keep faint playoff hopes alive. Super Giants have Matthew Breetzke, but he may not be able to match Markram's impact.* Sunrisers Hyderabad, Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings have already been eliminated from the IPL.","Cricket South Africa (CSA) directive of recalling its IPL-bound players by May 26 has come as a body blow for the franchises.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

NEW DELHI: Modern-day batting legend Virat Kohli ‚Äôs retirement from Test cricket has sparked an outpouring of admiration from across the cricketing world, with former England captains Michael Atherton and Nasser Hussain leading the chorus of praise. After a 14-year journey that reshaped Indian cricket‚Äôs approach to the red-ball game, Kohli announced his retirement on Instagram, ending a legendary career with 9,230 runs in 123 Tests, including 30 centuries.""I loved watching him play every day of his 123 Tests,"" Atherton said, speaking to Sky Sports. ""You couldn't take your eyes off Kohli. He put his heart and soul into Test cricket, and that energy and passion never seemed to dim.""Reflecting on Kohli‚Äôs retirement note, Atherton said it was significant that Kohli acknowledged the unique challenges of Test cricket ‚Äî a format he not only embraced but elevated with unmatched intensity.Kohli‚Äôs retirement leaves India facing a void at the crucial No. 4 position ahead of their five-Test series in England. ""You kind of pity the person who has to follow,"" Atherton remarked, noting the formidable legacy left behind by Kohli, much like his predecessor, Sachin Tendulkar Nasser Hussain echoed similar sentiments, hailing Kohli as a transformative figure. ""I‚Äôve been a massive Virat Kohli fan over the last 14 years,"" Hussain said on the Sky Sports Cricket podcast. ""But he was so much more than just the stats ‚Äî it was his aura, swagger, and passion. No one embodied the meaning of cricket in India more than Kohli.""Under Kohli‚Äôs leadership, India became the No. 1 Test side in the world, holding that position for a staggering 42 months. With 40 wins in 68 matches as captain, his aggressive style of leadership redefined India‚Äôs image in Test cricket ‚Äî fearless, fiery, and fit.""He is the ultimate winner,"" Hussain added. ""He can‚Äôt go on the field and not be 100 per cent. Everything for Kohli is about winning. That‚Äôs why he was so good in run chases and why India became such a formidable force.""As Team India prepares for the next World Test Championship cycle, all eyes will be on who steps into Kohli‚Äôs shoes. But for now, the cricket world stands united in celebrating a once-in-a-generation player who brought fire and flair to the longest format.","Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years.

Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman stirred the pot on social media with a cryptic tweet on Tuesday that read, ‚ÄúHeading to UAE to play against them. Keep me in your prayers.‚Äù While the tweet referred to his inclusion in the Bangladesh squad for the two-match T20I series against UAE on May 17 and 19, it came just hours after Delhi Capitals announced him as a replacement for Jake Fraser-McGurk in IPL 2025 triggering widespread confusion.Delhi Capitals confirmed Mustafizur‚Äôs return to the franchise, with the left-arm seamer coming in for Australian sensation Jake Fraser-McGurk, who has opted out of the remainder of the season due to personal reasons. Mustafizur, who has played for DC in the 2022 and 2023 seasons, was signed for INR 6 crore.However, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) cast immediate doubt on the move, stating that they had not yet received a formal request for a No-Objection Certificate (NOC). ‚ÄúI can't say (whether Mustafiz will join Delhi Capitals),‚Äù BCB CEO Nizamuddin Chowdhury told. ‚ÄúHe is with the team (flying to UAE), no? We haven't got any decision (joining Delhi Capitals) in this regard yet.‚ÄùQuiz: Who's that IPL player? The uncertainty leaves DC in a tricky situation, especially with the playoff race heating up. Mustafizur‚Äôs experience could be vital as Delhi prepare to take on fellow contenders Gujarat Titans, Mumbai Indians, and Punjab Kings in their final three games. They are currently fifth with 13 points from 11 matches, just behind MI who have played one more fixture.With 61 IPL wickets to his name and a reputation as one of the most deceptive T20 bowlers in the game, Mustafizur‚Äôs availability could make a big difference to DC‚Äôs playoff hopes ‚Äî but for now, his journey appears headed for UAE, not the IPL.Whether the pacer will switch his Bangladesh jersey for the DC blue later this week remains a waiting game.","Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman tweets he is heading to UAE for T20 series.

Poll Do you believe Carlo Ancelotti can successfully revive Brazilian football? No, I don't think so. Yes, absolutely!

Melbourne: Australian Open, MCG, Australian GP and lots more

When you are in trouble, hire a suit. And when Brazilian football is desperate, they go for the Harvey Specter of world football. We know him as Carlo Ancelotti . Armed with a truckload of well-cut Italian suits, a love for good cigars and vintage wine, and a serial winner's attitude, good ol' ‚ÄòDon' Carlo will travel some 8400 km across the Atlantic to give Brazil's flatterers some hope.It is the only fuel, though CBF president Ednaldo Rodrigues would say otherwise, that has forced Brazil to tear down the ‚ÄòBerlin' wall, finally.For good or bad, Brazil is known across the globe for the Amazon rainforest, a geographical accident, and football, a man-made epiphany. In 1894, an Englishman, Charles Miller, sailed across the ocean with a few footballs and, like they say, the world wasn't the same anymore. An Italian, over a century later, is tasked to do something similar ‚Äî reinvent the winning curve.The men in yellow and green had ensured the football sun rose from that part of the world. Most things adorable in the game, that triggers a thousand explosions in the mind, were of Brazilian make. Inimitable.As with most empires, the sun has also set on Brazilian football. After 23 years and five World Cup failures, Brazil football and its people, somewhat reluctantly, went for the last option available. Bring in foreign knowhow to stave off more ignominy.Once enjoying an embarrassment of football riches, Brazil has only made the World Cup semifinal once in the last five attempts. The outcome was eminently forgettable, a historical disaster. The most recent mortification, against neighbours and bitter rivals Argentina at the Monumental in the 2026 World Cup qualifier, was the final straw.Get Ancelotti to stave off recurrent humiliation if not for engineering a World Cup victory.Not all are happy with Ancelotti's appointment. President Lula da Silva said within 48 hours of the announcement, ‚ÄúHonestly, I have nothing against him being a foreigner... What I think is that we have coaches in Brazil capable of leading the Selecao.‚Äù Heads of the state expressing their innermost thoughts on football is not atypical in Brazil. Luiz Felipe Scolari, the 2002 World Cup winning team coach, had to survive presidential pressures to stick to his decision of excluding Romario from the Japan, Korea-bound squad in 2002.One can just hope that Ancelotti, winner of five Champions League titles and insurance of club success in Europe, can survive presidential displeasure for the next 13 months and disperse the dangerously fashionable idea that all migrants are detrimental to culture and society.Certain things are in Ancelotti's favour. Top six out of 10 teams from Latin America will automatically qualify for this 48-team World Cup starting next June. The Italian tactician will get some quiet time to study and fix what is broken without the accompanying anxiety of non-qualification.Secondly, in what is surely to be a Europe-based squad, Ancelotti's credentials will never be in question. His fame has escaped none and in this data-driven world, no current Brazilian coach worth his salt can hold a candle to Ancelotti . One can list some 40-odd Brazilian players who have helped Ancelotti put together an unputdownable CV. Under his leadership, two among them, Vinicius Junior and Kaka, have been voted the best players in the world. Kaka in 2007, while playing for AC Milan and, of course, Real Madrid's Vinicius in 2024.Vinicius, Rodrygo and Raphinha, Selecao's designated front-three, have grown into excitable commodities under his watch ‚Äì the arched eyebrow intact ‚Äî in Spain. One may see Casemiro, once Ancelotti's go-to man at Real, being recalled to cure the midfield anaemia that Brazil have suffered against France, Holland, Germany, Belgium and Croatia in the World Cups, once a tournament of their making and liking.Who's left in Europe, one may wonder?The challenges, too, are varied and complex. The issue of Neymar is a sore thumb for Brazil. Injuryplagued and forced back to the Brazilian ecosystem, Neymar was last seen in tears, limping out of the pitch in a Santos shirt a month ago. Getting the 34-year-old back to prime fitness to survive the rigours of international football seems to be an insurmountable task for Ancelotti. Else, he must find a new No. 10 in real quick time. A search for two wing backs and a consistent partner for centre-back and captain Marqinhos would also be a priority.Only three non-Brazilians have ever led the Selecao in its hallowed anthology, and they coached just seven games in all. Uruguayan Ramon Platero was the first in 1925 and managed four games, Joreca of Portugal managed two games in 1944, with Argentine Filpo Nunez the last foreign appointment, overseeing a single game in 1965. None among them was in charge of Brazil's World Cup destiny.Ancelotti ticked many successful firsts in his illustrious journey as a coach. Helming a national team, however, is going to be another matter, a point that was raised by President Lula in 2023 when Ancelotti's name began doing the rounds after Tite's failure in Qatar three years ago. ‚ÄúHe has never been Italy's national coach... Why does he not resolve the problems of Italy, which did not even qualify for the 2022 World Cup?‚Äù the President had pertinently pointed out.Not all are sceptical of the unprecedented choice, though. ‚ÄòO Galinho' Zico had been one of the pioneers to prescribe Ancelotti as the antidote to Brazil's woes. ‚ÄúIn fact, if I had to choose someone to replace Tite, a foreign coach, Ancelotti would be the first name on my list. Ancelotti likes Brazilian football, and he knows it well,‚Äù Zico, once a club rival in the 1980s Serie A, had said.Questions would irk Ancelotti throughout his time in the Brazilian theatre. The first of his on-field skirmishes is scheduled against Ecuador on June 6, just three weeks away, and Paraguay four days later. Taking charge on May 26, he will get a mere 10 days to put the right foot forward.Starting well may not be half the battle won for Ancelotti, but the buzz around Brazil will only grow exponentially. Cheers or jeers, only time will tell.","Carlo Ancelotti has been appointed as the new coach of Brazil's national football team. The Italian has won five Champions League titles and insurance of club success in Europe. President Lula da Silva said within 48 hours of the announcement, ‚ÄúHonestly, I have nothing against him being a foreigner‚Äù","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121176444,imgsize-100460,width-400,resizemode-4/Carlo-Ancelotti.jpg"

Delhi in race to host playoff ties

MUMBAI: Most overseas players, barring a few Australians and Englishmen, are set to return for IPL 2025 when the tournament resumes on Saturday (May 17), following a week-long suspension due to cross border tensions between India and Pakistan.According to a source, among those who have confirmed their participation are Australian captain Pat Cummins, who is set to lead Australia in the World Test Championship final at Lord‚Äôs from June 11, and opener Travis Head.While the return of Sunrisers Hyderabad captain Cummins and Head is good news, the team is already out of the playoff race. SRH have only two matches remaining.The teams currently best placed in terms of overseas player availability are Gujarat Titans, Mumbai Indians and Kolkata Knight Riders, who are all set to be back at full strength.On Tuesday, MI had their first training session at the Wankhede Stadium since the BCCI announced the league‚Äôs resumption. captain Rohit Sharma attended the session alongwith overseas players Mitchell Santner, Bevon Jacobs, and Mujeeb Ur Rahman ‚Äî all of whom had stayed back with the team during the break.The remaining overseas players, including England allrounder Will Jacks and wicketkeeper Ryan Rickelton, are expected to arrive from Thursday. MI restart their campaign against Delhi Capitals on May 21 which gives them ample time to reassemble their squad.In GT‚Äôs case, former England white-ball captain Jos Buttler and South African pacer Gerald Coetzee are expected to arrive on Wednesday, while Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada and Sherfane Rutherford had stayed back in India. The Titans are well-positioned to qualify for the playoffs.In a setback for Rajasthan Royals, their bowling coach Shane Bond is ‚Äúhighly unlikely‚Äù to return, TOI has learnt. The franchise also remains uncertain about the availability of England pacer Jofra Archer ‚Äî selected for the England vs West Indies ODI series starting May 29 ‚Äî and West Indies batter Shimron Hetmyer.Australian pacers Josh Hazlewood (RCB), who is injured, and Mitchell Starc will both skip the remainder of the tournament.Punjab Kings are still unsure about the return of Australian players Josh Inglis and Marcus Stoinis while South African pace all-rounder Marco Jansen remains stationed in Dubai. Inglis has also been picked in Australia‚Äôs squad for the WTC final.Meanwhile, a reliable BCCI source told TOI that Delhi is also in contention to host the four IPL-2025 playoff matches, along with Ahmedabad ‚Äî the likely venue for the final ‚Äî and Mumbai.‚ÄúThe final was moved out of Kolkata due to forecast of heavy rain around June 3, the scheduled date of the final.

NEW DELHI: In a historic milestone for Indian cricket Ravindra Jadeja has etched his name deeper into the sport‚Äôs legacy by maintaining the longest-ever reign as the No. 1 all-rounder in Test cricket history for 1,151 days.The star spinner and dependable lower-order batter continues to stand tall atop the ICC Men‚Äôs Test All-Rounder Rankings , an achievement no player before him has managed for such an extended period.Jadeja‚Äôs dominance at the top is not just a testament to his consistency but also his unmatched versatility across conditions. Whether it‚Äôs a gritty fifty on a crumbling pitch or a match-turning five-wicket haul, the 36-year-old has become a pillar of India's Test side.His reign as the world's best all-rounder underscores the rare balance he brings to the game, something few in cricketing history have achieved.But while Jadeja's place at the top remains unshaken, Bangladesh‚Äôs Mehidy Hasan Miraz is quietly making headlines of his own.Following a phenomenal Test series against Zimbabwe, where he scored 116 runs and claimed 15 wickets, Miraz climbed to No. 2 in the all-rounder rankings. His career-best rating of 327 puts him just 73 points behind Jadeja, adding an exciting edge to the next few Test series.The rankings also saw significant movement across the board. Bangladesh's Test win in Chattogram spurred leaps for players like Taijul Islam and Shadman Islam , while England's Joe Root remained the No. 1 batter. Jasprit Bumrah , meanwhile, retained his crown as the world‚Äôs top Test bowler.Still, the spotlight firmly belongs to Jadeja. In an era dominated by specialists, his prolonged excellence with both bat and ball has redefined what it means to be a modern all-rounder‚Äîand now, he's officially the greatest in that role Test cricket has ever seen.","Ravindra Jadeja has been the No. 1 all-rounder in Test cricket for 1,151 days.

The quiet grind, the long days, the small moments that no one sees but that stay with you forever.""He continued: ""As I step away from this format, it's not easy -- but it feels right. I've given it everything I had, and it's given me back so much more than I could've hoped for.

IPL 2025 suspended: What happens next?

Australia's women's cricket team captain and Mitchell Starc's partner, Alyssa Healy , shared her experience after the Dharamsala fixture between Punjab Kings (PBKS) and Delhi Capitals (DC) was halted midway due to security reasons; panic gripped the overseas players both the teams.""We weren't sure what was going to unfold in the next three days because all the Northern airports were shut,"" Healy said on thepodcast.Healy also pointed out how the "" misinformation "" created a ruckus among the Australian cricketers.""So yeah, there was a lot of anxiety around, especially probably the Australian group because we didn't have a whole heap of information as to what was going on, and that's probably been, and I'll say this has been the really interesting and probably the scariest part of this whole situation is probably the misinformation that's around the world and probably around life in general at the moment. There's a lot going on, but everything you read was different. Everything you saw was different,"" she explained.""Everything you heard was different. So what was actually taking place? No one really knew. Even the governments weren't really sure what was going on because no one could really understand unless you were quite literally living in these villages that were getting attacked.""So I think that created probably more of the anxiety. I think there was a lot of talk around we shouldn't be playing. It's not a great time to be playing, first and foremost, but also we're quite close to what's being fought over.""Healy also revealed the whispers that were going around among the teams and broadcasting crew.""There were 300 people, I believe. It was a travelling circus. Trying to get out. So there were a few whispers of pack a small bag. We're getting on a bus tonight. We're leaving. We're getting out of here,"" she said.""It was quickly shut down by some security briefing that said, look, if you go tonight, you're at a real risk of something happening because driving on the roads, first and foremost in that area, is not safe at night; the roads aren't great. It's quite hilly. And if your driver gets tired, you're in strife.So we'll go together tomorrow. I've got a plan in place. We'll get you out in the morning. Don't panic. Sit tight tonight. Help yourself to the buffet.""The wicketkeeper-batter also revealed the funny discussion the Australian contingent were having in the resort that was booked for the players in Dharamsala.""We're staying in this beautiful resort in Dharamsala that looks over the whole town, and you've got the mountain behind you. And it felt like you could be anywhere in the world on an exotic holiday. And here we are being told we're going to get evacuated. But yeah, don't panic.
