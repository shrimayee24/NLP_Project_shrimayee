'I've put an end to all fights': Uddhav says open to joining hands with Raj Thackeray,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ive-put-end-to-all-fights-uddhav-says-open-to-join-hands-with-raj-thackeray/articleshow/120429555.cms,"Uddhav Thackeray and Raj Thackeray (File photos)

NEW DELHI: In what could be another dramatic churn in Maharashtra politics , Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday expressed willingness for a political tie-up with his estranged cousin Raj Thackeray Uddhav Thackeray's remark suggesting thaw with his brother, who parted ways and formed his own Maharashtra Navnirman Sena party, comes when the election at India's biggest municipal body, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), is due to be held this year.""I am ready to come together (with Raj Thackeray). I am ready to come forward in the interest of Maharashtra, keeping aside minor incidents. I have put an end to all fights. The interest of Maharashtra is my priority,"" Uddhav Thackeray, who is also Maharashtra's former CM, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI during his address at the 57th annual general meeting of Bharatiya Kamgar Sena.Raj Thackeray echoed a similar sentiment, saying that ""coming together is not difficult"" and that differences between cousins are ""proving costly for the existence of Maharashtra and Marathi people"".""The disputes and fights between Uddhav and me are minor -- Maharashtra is much bigger than all that. These differences are proving costly for the existence of Maharashtra and the Marathi people,"" Raj Thackeray was quoted as saying by news agency IANS.He further said: ""Coming together is not difficult, it’s a matter of will. It’s not just about my desire or selfishness. We need to look at the bigger picture. All Marathi people across political parties should unite and form a single party.""The MNS chief further distinguished his past political decisions from the Eknath Shinde-led rebellion, saying: ""I left Shiv Sena when MLAs and MPs were with me. Even then, I chose to walk alone because I couldn't work under anyone except Balasaheb Thackeray. I had no objection to working with Uddhav. The question is -- does the other side have the will to work with me?""“If Maharashtra wants us to come together, let Maharashtra speak up. I don’t let my ego get in the way of such matters,” he added.Uddhav Thackeray’s move to ride the new political wagon comes at a time when the Maha Vikas Aghadi , formed to counter the BJP, has been reeling from a crisis ever since its humiliating loss in the Maharashtra assembly elections last year.Raj Thackeray and Uddhav Thackeray, two key figures in Maharashtra politics, share a long and complex history shaped by the towering legacy of the late Bal Thackeray , their uncle and father, respectively, who founded the Shiv Sena. Their political journeys, once aligned under the same saffron banner, gradually diverged into rivalry and competing visions.While both were groomed in the party’s ranks, Raj was long seen as the natural heir due to his oratory style and aggressive street politics that mirrored Bal Thackeray’s persona. However, in the early 2000s, Balasaheb chose Uddhav, his quieter and more organisationally minded son, to lead the party, ""sidelining"" Raj.This decision created a rift, culminating in Raj’s exit from Shiv Sena in 2005.He soon launched his own party, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), with a similar pro-Marathi ideology, but it failed to match the dominance of the original Sena. Since then, Raj and Uddhav have often found themselves on opposing sides of Maharashtra’s political battles, with sporadic talk of reconciliation but no real unity.While Uddhav led Shiv Sena into an alliance with ideologically divergent parties like the Congress and NCP under the MVA to keep the BJP out of power, Raj oscillated between supporting the BJP and positioning himself as an independent force, often attempting to reclaim his relevance through hardline rhetoric against Hindi and north Indian migrant workers in Mumbai or issue-based campaigns.Their relationship today remains politically distant, shaped more by competition and legacy than by family ties.","Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray expresses willingness for a political tie-up with his estranged cousin Raj Thackerays.

Bam Adebayo: The Ideal Frontcourt Upgrade

How Adebayo Fits with the Golden State Warriors

Thenarrowly escaped a Play-In disaster against the Memphis Grizzlies , securing the No. 7 seed in the Western Conference. But even with their postseason spot locked in, changes may be necessary this offseason—starting with moving on from Buddy Hield and pursuing Miami Heat star, as predicted by Caleb Hightower of Sporting News Buddy Hield’s early-season promise as a Klay Thompson replacement has faded. His three-point shooting, once reliable, has plummeted to concerning lows:- December: 30.5% from three- January: 31.5% from three- Play-In performance: 1-of-4 from deep against MemphisWhile Hield finished the regular season at 37.0% from beyond the arc, his inconsistency makes him a liability. As Caleb Hightower noted,If the Golden State Warriors exit the playoffs early, targeting Bam Adebayo in a trade could reshape their roster. The three-time All-Star has evolved into a complete two-way force:- 2024-25 Stats: 18.1 PPG, 9.6 RPG, 4.3 APG- Shooting Splits: 48.5% FG, 35.7% 3P- Versatility: Scores inside, handles the ball, and stretches the floorAdebayo’s growth from a defensive specialist to an offensive weapon addresses Golden State’s need for a dynamic big man.1. Scoring Boost: Provides interior scoring and mid-range efficiency.2. Playmaking: Adds a facilitator from the high post.3. Defensive Anchor: Complements Draymond Green’s versatility.The Trade ScenarioA Hield-Adebayo swap wouldn’t improve the Warriors’ outside shooting, but it would give them a proven All-Star to pair with Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. Miami, meanwhile, could benefit from Hield’s shooting if they retool their roster.Potential Trade Package- Warriors Receive: Bam Adebayo- Heat Receive: Buddy Hield, future draft picks, and/or young playersAlso read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Los Angeles predicted to acquire 6-foot-8 Brooklyn Nets forward to form Big 3 with LeBron James and Luka Doncic Golden State’s playoff run will dictate their urgency, but pivoting from Hield to Adebayo makes sense.

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings (PBKS) return home brimming with confidence after clinically dismantling Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in a rain-shortened clash at the Chinnaswamy just two days ago. But as both sides gear up for the rematch in Match No. 37 of IPL 2025 at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium in New Chandigarh, the stakes are significantly higher.With five wins in eight matches, PBKS are sitting pretty in second place. Another win here would further solidify their playoff push. RCB, on the other hand, despite a strong start to the season, now find themselves slipping to fourth after back-to-back losses. They'll be desperate to stop the slide and regain momentum on what promises to be a spin-friendly track in Chandigarh.In Saturday’s 14-over rain-affected clash, PBKS executed their plans to perfection. Their bowlers, led by Marco Jansen (2/10), Yuzvendra Chahal, and Harpreet Brar, skittled RCB for just 95. Arshdeep Singh’s early double strike -- including the prized wicket of Virat Kohli -- set the tone.While RCB showed brief resistance through Tim David’s unbeaten 50, it wasn’t enough to mask a middle-order collapse. Punjab chased down the target with 11 balls to spare, thanks to a calm, match-winning knock from Nehal Wadhera, who remained unbeaten on 33 off 19.Wadhera, still new to IPL stardom, is now pushing for a regular middle-order spot -- especially with Shashank Singh and Josh Inglis yet to find form.RCB will want to brush off that defeat quickly, knowing they simply didn’t show up with the bat. Josh Hazlewood (3/14) and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2/26) were bright spots with the ball, but RCB's batting fragility -- especially in the Powerplay -- has become a pattern.Phil Salt’s explosive starts haven’t lasted, while Kohli’s dismissal for just 1 in the last outing raised eyebrows. Captain Rajat Patidar is yet to truly stamp his authority, despite crossing 1000 IPL runs last game. They’ll hope Tim David can carry his late-innings form into a more prominent role.The big question for RCB is whether they stick with the same XI or ring in changes -- especially in spin, where PBKS clearly held the edge.The pitch in New Chandigarh is expected to play slow and low, especially in the second innings. Spinners have traditionally found grip here, making Harpreet Brar and Chahal crucial for Punjab. RCB, meanwhile, will likely rely on Suyash Sharma and Krunal Pandya to counter.If dew stays away in the evening, expect the toss to play a big role -- with both captains eyeing a chance to bowl first and exploit the early tackiness.The Maharaja Yadavindra Singh Stadium has favored spinners and slower bowlers this season. The dry surface tends to hold up, especially in the evening games, and scoring in the second innings hasn’t been easy.

Sonya responded to her son’s latest accolade with a heartfelt note.As Seth Curry has secured the NBA’s three-point percentage crown, finishing the season as the league’s most efficient shooter from deep, his mother, Sonya Curry, reacted with a heartfelt gesture. “I’m so proud of you @sdotcurry !

Yeah, it means a little bit something,” he continued.This season, Seth hit a career-high 45.6% from beyond the arc, knocking down 83 of his 182 attempts.“I think I check my numbers maybe two or three times a year. I’m just going out there, playing the right way, trying to lead this group on and off the floor. If I’m open, be aggressive, make plays, knock down shots. If I’m not, swing it to the open guy.

Just try to give confidence to the group.”Reflecting on his journey through a challenging season, Seth shared how constant communication with the coaching staff kept him mentally locked in. “The constant communication with coach was good,” he said, explaining how he stayed prepared despite fluctuating minutes. “My adaptability and being able to come in with a rhythm… that’s important,” Curry noted. “Come in, make shots right away – that’s important,” he added.Also Read: “Basketball Gods smiled down” – Magic Johnson sends clear message about NBA playoff matchups for fans Hornets Head Coach Charles Lee also reacted to Seth’s latest milestone. “Very excited for Seth,” Lee said adding, “It’s cool for our organization, but even cooler for him.

NEW DELHI: Saturday's IPL 2025 double-header served up two nail-biters, with Jos Buttler and Avesh Khan playing lead roles in contrasting fashion to guide Gujarat Titans and Lucknow Super Giants to memorable wins over Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals, respectively.In Ahmedabad, Buttler weathered cramps and unleashed a blistering unbeaten 97 off 54 balls to steer Gujarat Titans to a seven-wicket victory over Delhi Capitals.Chasing 204, GT overcame early hiccups with Shubman Gill and B Sai Sudharsan departing early, but Buttler anchored the chase alongside Sherfane Rutherford (43), the pair adding a match-turning 119-run stand for the third wicket.Buttler’s knock was a masterclass in timing and power; he famously took apart Mitchell Starc for five consecutive boundaries in the 15th over, blending classical strokeplay with brute efficiency.Despite missing out on a hundred, Buttler ensured the chase ended with four balls to spare as Rahul Tewatia finished things in style.Earlier, Prasidh Krishna’s 4/41 helped restrict DC to 203/8 despite fighting knocks from Axar Patel (39) and Ashutosh Sharma (37 off 19).In Jaipur, Avesh Khan delivered under extreme pressure, defending nine runs in the final over as Lucknow Super Giants eked out a two-run win against Rajasthan Royals.RR, chasing 181, were coasting at 156/2 in 17 overs with a blazing Yashasvi Jaiswal (74) and 14-year-old debutant Vaibhav Suryavanshi (34) setting the tone.But Avesh’s deadly 18th over, removing Jaiswal and Riyan Parag, turned the game on its head.With nine needed off the final six, Avesh dismissed Shimron Hetmyer and conceded just six runs, finishing with 3/37 and sealing a heist win for LSG.Earlier, Aiden Markram (66) and Ayush Badoni (50) helped LSG post a competitive 180/5, with Abdul Samad’s 10-ball 30 lifting them past 175.The wins saw Gujarat Titans climb to the top of the table, while Lucknow Super Giants revived their campaign with a gritty, last-over triumph that will be talked about for days.","Buttler weathered cramps and unleashed a blistering unbeaten 97 off 54 balls to steer Gujarat Titans to a seven-wicket victory over Delhi Capitals.

Rangers fire Head Coach, but front office missteps fuel deeper crisis



In a move that’s more scapegoat than solution, the New York Rangers fired head coach Peter Laviolette on Saturday and with it, tried to wash their hands of one of the most embarrassing collapses in recent franchise history. After a record-setting 2022-23 season, the Rangers didn’t just miss the playoffs in 2024, they imploded. And rather than admit the problem runs deeper than the bench, GM Chris Drury seems content pinning it all on the coaching staff.Let’s call it what it is: the Rangers' issues didn’t start or end with Peter Laviolette. Yes, the team underperformed. Yes, their power play was abysmal. But to act like the man behind the bench is the root of the problem is a convenient narrative that protects the real culprits, the ones in suits, not skates.Drury’s roster decisions were puzzling all season long. Trading captain Jacob Trouba mid-season raised eyebrows. Shipping off Kaapo Kakko and Filip Chytil while shuffling in new faces like J.T. Miller and Carson Soucy only added to the instability. And let’s not forget the March deadline moves that felt more like desperation than direction. The chemistry never clicked because the pieces kept changing and that’s not on Laviolette.Worse yet, the Rangers are now part of a not-so-proud club, one of only four teams in NHL history to win the Presidents’ Trophy and miss the playoffs the very next season. That’s not just a stumble. That’s a structural failure.Still, Drury insists his job is safe and that “it starts with me.” But if it truly started with him, he wouldn’t be dodging questions about ownership’s confidence. He wouldn’t be pushing the narrative that a new coach, whether it’s a recycled NHL name or an unproven college upstart, is the magic fix.Also Read: Penguins duo Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin set rivalry aside, celebrate Alex Ovechkin’s historic goal record with Rolex gift And where does this leave the locker room? A rotating door of coaches, a confused roster, and now a fanbase expected to trust that the next hire will right the ship. The truth is, the Rangers' problems won’t be solved with a new face behind the bench. Until the front office owns up to its missteps, New York is chasing shadows.The Rangers didn’t just fire Laviolette. They lit the fuse on a bigger crisis.","The New York Rangers fired head coach Peter Laviolette on Saturday.

The Rajasthan Royals management handed Suryavanshi his debut after their regular captain, Sanju Samson, was sidelined due to a thumb injury.Hailing from the Samastipur district of Bihar, the left-handed batsman sent a wave of excitement through the Sawai Mansingh Stadium crowd when he powerfully struck the very first ball he faced for a massive six.By hitting a six on his first delivery, Suryavanshi joined an exclusive club that includes players like Rob Quiney (RR), Kevon Cooper (RR), Andre Russell (KKR), Carlos Brathwaite (DD, now Delhi Capitals), Aniket Choudhary (RCB), Javon Searles (KKR), Siddesh Lad (MI), Mahesh Theekshana (CSK), and Sameer Rizvi (CSK).Suryavanshi played a quick and impactful innings, scoring 34 runs off just 20 balls. He also formed a strong 85-run opening partnership with Yashasvi Jaiswal against the Lucknow Super Giants .His impressive batting even caught the attention of Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who expressed his amazement on X, writing: ""Woke up to watch an 8th grader play in the IPL!!!! What a debut!""Suryavanshi had already made headlines in the IPL 2025 auction when, at the age of 13, he became the youngest player to secure an IPL contract, with the Royals acquiring his services for Rs 1.1 crore.He has also represented India Under-19, notably scoring a rapid 58-ball century in a four-day game against Australia U-19.Despite Suryavanshi's remarkable debut, the Rajasthan Royals narrowly lost the match by 2 runs.Aiden Markram and Ayush Badoni scored half-centuries and contributed a crucial 76-run partnership for the fourth wicket, helping Lucknow Super Giants reach a total of 180 for 5.In their reply, Jaiswal (74), Riyan Parag (39), and the young Vaibhav (34) put Rajasthan Royals in a promising position.

Seth Rollins wins the triple threat match at WrestleMania 41



Finally, the moment everyone had been waiting for arrived—the main event of the night: a colossal Triple Threat match featuring Seth Rollins Roman Reigns , and CM Punk .All three superstars made electrifying entrances, but it was CM Punk’s that truly stole the spotlight. Walking in alongside Paul Heyman, Punk's entrance marked the first time in years that Roman Reigns entered a match alone—without his ""Wiseman"" by his side.As the bell rang, Punk immediately rolled out of the ring, mocking Reigns by chatting with Heyman about both Roman and Seth. This made Roman furious, while Seth couldn’t help but laugh at the situation. Without wasting a second, Reigns lashed out and struck Rollins.Roman began asserting dominance, unleashing a number of strikes on both Punk and Rollins. But Rollins quickly recovered, launching a suicide dive onto Reigns at ringside and throwing him into the steel steps.The action spilled into the crowd, with Punk and Rollins brawling fiercely. Both superstars took full advantage of the No Disqualification stipulation, battling with steel chairs and trash cans. Punk even slammed Rollins onto a trash can, sending the audience into a frenzy.Just when it seemed like chaos couldn’t get any crazier, Roman Reigns leaped into the crowd, taking down both Rollins and Punk before clearing off the announce table to continue his assault.Back inside the ring, Reigns continued to dominate until Punk reversed a Superman Punch attempt. The momentum shifted in Punk’s favor as he began landing heavy shots on both opponents, even hitting simultaneous DDTs on Reigns and Rollins. Reigns charged in for a Spear, but Punk reversed it into a GTS—only for Reigns to counter, and the two exchanged a brutal series of strikes.Punk then locked Reigns in the Anaconda Vise, but Rollins broke it up with a top-rope splash.

Jos Buttler Exclusive Interview: I owe Jayawardene for letting me open in T20

Gujarat Titans vs Delhi Capitals

GT vs DC scoreboard

IPL points table

Gujarat Titans ’ Jos Buttler gave ample demonstration of his ball-striking powers and fitness standards in punishing heat on Saturday, exhibiting yet again why he is still one of the top-rated batters in the shortest format.The 34-year-old Buttler (97* off 54b; 11x4, 4x6) and West Indian Sherfane Rutherford (43 off 34b; 1x4, 3x6) shared a 119-run third-wicket partnership as the Titans chased down Delhi Capitals ’ 204 in 19.2 overs with seven wickets and four balls to spare. With the win, GT also moved to the top of the table.The pursuit of 204, however, began on a wrong note for the Titans as captain Shubman Gill (7) was run out by a Karun Nair direct hit after he went for a non-existent single. Sai Sudharsan (36 off 21b; 5x4, 1x6) and Buttler added 60 off 35 balls to put the chase back on track.Sudharsan caressed Aussie paceman Mitchell Starc for two boundaries through cover, showing why his batting is so highly regarded in the Indian cricket circles. He greeted Axar by sweeping him for six, but an attempt to smash left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav to the boundary saw him getting caught at deep mid-wicket.From there on, it was the Buttler and Rutherford show. Both were kept in check in the middle overs by Kuldeep and Vipraj Nigam but just as the pressure was building, Rutherford got going with a six off Kuldeep over extra cover before smashing Mohit Sharma for two consecutive sixes.Axar brought Starc back to break the partnership but the pacer was struck for five consecutive boundaries by Buttler in the 15th over. In the end, Rahul Tewatia smashed a six and a four off Starc’s first two balls of the last over to take the team over the line.Earlier, after DC were put in to bat, opener Abishek Porel began by smashing Mohammed Siraj for 14 in the opening over. However, he didn’t last long, bringing KL Rahul and Karun Nair together.The Capitals galloped to 74/2 in six overs and looked set for a huge total on the placid batting wicket, but just as Nair (31 off 18b; 2x4, 2x6) was beginning to break the shackles, Prasidh Krishna (4/41) cut his stay short.Axar (39 off 32b; 1x4, 2x6) and South African Tristan Stubbs (31 off 21b; 2x4, 1x6) steadied the ship with a 53-run alliance, with both hitting leg spinner Rashid Khan for a six each.","Gujarat Titans beat Delhi Capitals by seven wickets in the Indian Premier League.

Poll How impressed were you with Vaibhav's debut performance? Not impressed. Somewhat impressed. Very impressed!

Vaibhav Suryavanshi became the youngest cricketer to play in the IPL.

Last Nov, Rajasthan Royals caused a stir by bidding Rs 1.1 crore for 13-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi at the IPL mega auction. The RR talent scouts were no doubt impressed by his feats — a first-class debut for Bihar in Jan 2024, a 58-ball ton, the fastest by an Indian, against Australia U-19s in Sept. But many still wondered if RR wasn’t taking a massive gamble. Would he be able to make the huge leap into the IPL big league, or would he be embarrassed before an audience of millions?On Saturday night, the moment of reckoning arrived. At 14 years and 23 days, Vaibhav was the youngest to make his IPL de but by some distance — Prayas Ray Barman (RCB) held the previous record, of 16 years & 157 days.But how would Vaibhav fare? The answer arrived swiftly. Veteran Shardul Thakur delivered a length ball. Vaibhav made room and cracked the ball on the rise over extra cover. A six, off the very first ball he’d faced in his IPL career! Statements don’t get more emphatic than that.Vaibhav wasn’t done with his first-ball six. Facing another India player, Avesh Khan, he cleared his front leg and swung his third ball down the ground for six. Lady Luck beamed upon the gutsy teen—off his fifth ball, he earned a reprieve when Prince Yadav dropped a skier.An undaunted Vaibhav continued attacking and raced to 34 off just 18 balls, with three sixes and two fours. A maiden 50 seemed his for the taking, but Aiden Markram managed to rip a ball past him. Vaibhav’s back foot was in the air as he overbalanced, and Rishabh Pant whipped off the bails in a flash.The cricketing gods can be fickle, and one is reluctant to tempt fate. But in the course of a brief, dazzling cameo, the boy from Samastipur—a town about 100km from Patna—showed he belonged on the big stage.","Vaibhav Suryavanshi became the youngest cricketer to play in the IPL.

Did MI miss the trick?

Rohit Sharma in IPL

Ab unke jaane ka samay hain

Rohit Sharma has had a disastrous start to this year's Indian Premier League (IPL). The 38-year-old has scored just 82 runs in six innings at a dismal average of 13.66. The opener's 26 off 16 balls against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Thursday was his highest score this season.Rohit's lean patch has coincided with the Mumbai Indians ' inconsistent performance this season. The Hardik Pandya-led franchise are currently seventh on the points table.Call it a lackadaisical attitude on the part of five-time champions Mumbai Indians, but they are partly suffering because of Rohit's poor form.Mumbai Indians head coach Mahela Jayawardene has subtly mentioned that the powerplay struggle has been costing the team. ""The powerplay is a concern for us with the ball and the bat,"" he said in a press conference. With Jasprit Bumrah back, MI potentially have the best bowling unit in the tournament. However, the struggles are evident with the bat.Despite Rohit's failures, Jayawardene has publicly backed the ageing star. He said: ""I still back the senior pros and all the guys I put out there. They have the skill. It's just that we need to be a bit more ruthless. At times, we're missing out on those one or two overs where we lose our discipline.""Indeed, Rohit has led Mumbai Indians to five IPL trophies in 11 years, but since 2022, he averages just 22.89. That is the second-lowest of the 21 openers to play 20-plus innings.Rohit, who helped end India's 11-year ICC title drought with the T20 World Cup win in 2024 and the Champions Trophy title last month, has batted past the powerplay in only 12 of his 36 IPL innings since the start of 2023 and is yet to bat outside the powerplay this year.Among those aged 35 and struggling in this year's IPL, Rohit Sharma is second only to Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) all-rounder Andre Russell, who has scored only 34 runs in seven outings. Unlike Rohit, however, Russell bats down the order and generally faces fewer deliveries. Among all IPL openers this season so far, Rohit Sharma's figures are the second-worst, after Delhi Capitals' Jake Fraser-McGurk, who has managed 55 runs in six outingsOver the years, Mumbai Indians have taken some ruthless calls and at the same time have unearthed top talent through their extensive scouting network, be it the Pandya brothers -- Krunal and Hardik -- Jasprit Bumrah, Ishan Kishan, Ramandeep Singh, and Vignesh Puthur and Ashwani Kumar this season.Let's go down memory lane. In 2013, midway through the season, the franchise decided to sack skipper Ricky Ponting, and Mumbai Indians went on to win their first IPL title.But that ruthless approach hasn't been followed in dealing with Rohit. His 15s and 20s are celebrated like there is no tomorrow. But the fact is that he is letting his team down. He occupies a crucial spot in the order, and with his fitness concerns and the current knee issue, it is anyone's guess whether he will play two more IPL seasons.Did Mumbai Indians miss a trick by retaining Rohit last year? Before the auction, they retained a 37-year-old guy. With him, it clearly shows they are not looking five years ahead, and with his dismal form, he is letting his team down.Rohit has crossed 400-plus runs in only one of the last five seasons, and former India opener Virender Sehwag has said that the IPL's most successful captain is not doing justice to his legacy. ""It is your legacy that is getting hurt.(It's now time for him to retire),"" he told Cricbuzz.Rohit Sharma's legendary status may likely earn him a longer rope, but it would be interesting to see for how long Mumbai Indians, a franchise known for taking brave calls, will back the weakest link.",Rohit Sharma has had a disastrous start to this year's Indian Premier League (IPL) The 38-year-old has scored just 82 runs in six innings at a dismal average of 13.66.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Australian pacer Josh Hazlewood has been troubled by injuries lately. He missed three Tests against India and the tour of Sri Lanka due to a side and calf strain before a hip injury forced him to skip the Champions Trophy in Feb-March. Even before these injuries played out, the Royal Challengers Bengaluru splashed out Rs 12.5 cr for him at the IPL auction.The 34-year-old has repaid the management’s faith with 12 scalps so far at a strike rate of 12.41. The lanky pacer, whose rehab and gym work in the lead up to the tournament is bearing fruit, has bowled 72 dot balls in seven matches. His control over the new ball has been impressive. There is an air of confidence in the way he is running up.“I’ve just felt better as the tournament’s gone on. I’ve done quite a bit of work in the nets. I just feel better in my run up and at the crease with every game that comes, so hopefully that continues,” Hazlewood said after his team’s disappointing third straight home loss here to Punjab Kings in a rain-curtailed 14-over-a-side match.“I’m still doing a fair bit of work on the rehab side of things, but everything’s feeling good and hopefully will stay that way,” he said.Though Hazlewood (3-14) finished on the losing side on Friday, he was on the money once again. The pacer, who has been highly effective in the powerplay, put pressure with his disciplined approach. He reminds one of all-time Aussie great Glenn McGrath, who was known for his accuracy and consistency.To be fair, Hazlewood has also been helped with the presence of experienced Indian operator, Bhuvneshwar Kumar , a master craftsman with the new ball and at the death. ‘Bhuvi’ has taken eight wickets and the two have struck a solid partnership.“Just to bowl with someone like Bhuvi, who’s been around for so long, so skilful at the start and at the end, it’s great to learn from him as well,” Hazlewood said.",Australian pacer Josh Hazlewood has been troubled by injuries lately.

Jos Buttler Exclusive Interview: I owe Jayawardene for letting me open in T20

Gujarat Titans captain Shubman Gill has been fined Rs 12 lakh for maintaining a slow over-rate during their IPL 2025 match against Delhi Capitals at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Saturday, marking the team's first over-rate offense of the season.The penalty was imposed under Article 2.22 of the IPL's Code of Conduct, which deals with minimum over-rate offenses. Gill, who was run out for seven runs in the match, joins other captains who have faced similar fines this season.DC's Axar Patel, MI's Hardik Pandya, RR's Riyan Parag and Sanju Samson, and LSG's Rishabh Pant have all previously been fined for over-rate offenses in IPL 2025.Despite the penalty, Gujarat Titans emerged victorious in the match, successfully chasing down 204 runs with four balls remaining in challenging Ahmedabad heat conditions.Jos Buttler played a crucial role in the victory, scoring an unbeaten 97 off 54 balls. He formed significant partnerships of 60 runs with B. Sai Sudharsan and 119 runs with Sherfane Rutherford.The chase marked a historic moment for GT as it was their first successful pursuit of a 200-plus total in their IPL history. It was also the first time any team had chased such a target against Delhi Capitals.GT's bowling attack contributed significantly, with Prasidh Krishna taking 4-41. Mohammed Siraj, Arshad Khan, Ishant Sharma, and R. Sai Kishore each claimed one wicket.The victory has propelled Gujarat Titans, the IPL 2022 champions, to the top of the 2025 season points table with 10 points from seven games. Delhi Capitals currently hold the second position, separated only by net run rate.GT will next face defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders at Eden Gardens on Monday evening, which notably is Gill's former IPL team.","Gujarat Titans captain Shubman Gill has been fined Rs 12 lakh for maintaining a slow over-rate during their IPL 2025 match against Delhi Capitals.

Poll Do you believe a mentor's role is crucial for a team's success? Not really, players can manage on their own. Yes, absolutely!

In the buildup to the much-anticipated Indian Premier League clash between Gujarat Titans and Delhi Capitals at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Saturday, a light-hearted exchange between KL Rahul and Delhi Capitals mentor Kevin Pietersen stole the spotlight — and the internet’s heart.The Delhi Capitals' social media team posted a seemingly innocent video of GT skipper Shubman Gill greeting Pietersen during practice. The two exchanged pleasantries before Pietersen, with his trademark charm, posed a rhetorical question: “Bro, what’s a mentor? No one knows what a mentor is. Can you tell me what a mentor is?”Just as Gill chuckled, KL Rahul — who was nearby, gearing up for the session — chimed in with a zinger that had everyone in splits.“Mentor is someone who goes to Maldives for two weeks mid-season,” Rahul quipped, sending Pietersen into a smile as others around joined the laughter.The Capitals’ admin didn’t miss the opportunity to ride the wave, captioning the clip: “Thanks, KL, now we know what a mentor does.”After the video went viral, Pietersen replied to Rahul through a social media post explaining the role of a 'mentor' in a funny way.""Mentor - The wise and sagacious guide of a cricket team who, through a mysterious blend of tactical genius and holiday planning, ensures the team is as adept at swinging bats as they are at swinging in hammocks. Known for the rare ability to teach the art of the perfect switch-hit and the secret to finding the best vacation deals during mid-season breaks. Often spotted with a clipboard in one hand and a travel brochure in the other,"" Pietersen wrote.On the field, DC, under the captaincy of Axar Patel , will look to maintain their pole position on the points table, having won five of their six matches. Gujarat Titans, currently third with four wins from six, are hot on their heels and will hope to break DC’s winning momentum in front of a home crowd.","KL Rahul and Kevin Pietersen exchange light-hearted jibes during practice.

NEW DELHI: New Zealand’s batting icon Kane Williamson shared his vision for the next era of cricketing greatness during an exclusive conversation with senior journalist K. Shriniwas Rao on TimesofIndia.com's latest episode of Bombay Sport Exchange When asked to name his “next Fab Four,” Williamson chuckled and replied, ""The five players that come to mind would be Yashasvi Jaiswal (India), Shubman Gill (India), Rachin Ravindra (New Zealand), Harry Brook (England) and Cameron Green from Australia.""Also See: MI vs SRH Coming from a player who is himself part of the modern ""Fab Four"" alongside Virat Kohli Steve Smith , and Joe Root, this endorsement carries tremendous weight.With over 9,276 Test runs at an average of 54.9, including 33 centuries, Williamson’s words reflect not just respect but a keen eye for future legends.The young Indian opener is enjoying a meteoric rise in the longer format, having already scored 1,798 runs in 19 Tests at an average of 52.9, including 4 centuries.His calm temperament and aggressive shot-making have made him a force at the top of the order.He was also part of India’s T20 World Cup-winning team, showing his growing presence in white-ball cricket, although he is yet to make his ODI debut.Gill’s classical style and adaptability have seen him become a regular in all three formats.In Tests, he has scored 1,893 runs in 32 matches with 5 centuries, averaging 35.While he hasn't quite replicated his white-ball dominance in the Test arena, he is widely regarded as the future captain of India's white-ball sides, thanks to his maturity and consistency in ODIs and T20Is.One of the most consistent and dependable new faces in the New Zealand setup, Rachin has been a key figure across all formats.In Tests, he’s scored 1,057 runs in 15 matches, averaging 37.8, with 2 centuries, including a career-best 240.His ability to slot into any role and contribute with both bat and ball makes him an all-format asset for the Kiwis.Harry Brook has been a revelation in red-ball cricket for England.In just 24 Tests, he has amassed 2,281 runs at a stunning average of 58.5, with 8 centuries and a high score of 317.His explosive style and aggression align perfectly with England’s ""Bazball"" strategy.Recognizing his potential as a leader and limited-overs performer, Brook has now been appointed England’s white-ball captain, marking a new chapter in his career.Despite battling recent injuries, Cameron Green remains a crucial all-rounder for Australia, offering balance with both bat and ball.In Tests, he’s scored 1,377 runs in 28 matches at an average of 36.2, with 2 centuries and a top score of 174*.His 13 sixes and 152 fours reflect his ability to shift gears, and when fully fit, Green is a game-changer in all three formats.Williamson’s nod to these five reflects both current performance and future potential.As the ""Fab Four"" era edges toward its twilight, this ""Fab Five"" could well be the torchbearers of the next golden generation of Test cricket.","Kane Williamson names five players to watch out for in next generation of cricketers.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals (DC) take on Shubman Gill’s Gujarat Titans (GT) in Match No. 35 of the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Saturday. The Capitals currently sit atop the points table with 10 points from six games, while Gujarat trail just behind with eight points from eight outings.DC will walk in high on confidence after their edge-of-the-seat Super Over victory against Rajasthan Royals -- a game where Mitchell Starc turned the tide with his ice-cold death-over brilliance. The Aussie speedster, known for his pinpoint yorkers and late swing, was the architect of that heist and continues to lead the pace attack with authority.But Starc and co. will be up against a GT top order that’s looked ominous. Shubman Gill’s fluent strokeplay, Sai Sudharsan’s consistency, and Jos Buttler’s explosiveness have powered Gujarat’s batting thus far. Between them, they’ve notched up at least one fifty in every match — and DC will know that cracking that code early could unravel the Titans.On the flip side, all eyes will be on Mohammed Siraj, who’s found his groove after a testing season of international cricket. Siraj, fresh and firing, has bagged 10 wickets with a miserly economy of 8.50 — especially potent in the Powerplay. His matchup against Delhi’s young openers Jake Fraser-McGurk and Abishek Porel will be one to watch. The duo has shown flashes of potential but faces a stern examination under the Ahmedabad sun.And should early wickets fall, the Capitals will lean on veterans KL Rahul and Karun Nair to anchor the innings. Local lad Axar Patel, who plies his domestic trade for Gujarat, will be keen to shine at his home ground — especially now that he’s back in form with both bat and ball.Spin could prove decisive on a dry Ahmedabad deck. GT will back their seasoned duo of Rashid Khan and R Sai Kishore to keep things tight in the middle overs, while DC’s Kuldeep Yadav — if fit — will be their X-factor. His wrist spin has been Delhi’s trump card, ably complemented by the promising Vipraj Nigam. But Kuldeep’s availability remains in question after a shoulder niggle saw him leave the field in their last outing.Traditionally a true surface with pace and bounce, the Ahmedabad pitch this season has played slower than expected in afternoon games. Batters who apply themselves early can reap rewards later, but spinners and cutters into the surface have found assistance. With the match scheduled for 3:30 PM, dew won't be a factor, but dryness might.Jake Fraser-McGurk, Abishek Porel, KL Rahul, Karun Nair, Axar Patel (c), Tristan Stubbs, Mitchell Starc, Mukesh Kumar, Mohit Sharma, Dushmantha Chameera, Kuldeep Yadav (if fit) / Vipraj NigamAshutosh SharmaShubman Gill (c), B Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler (wk), Shahrukh Khan, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, R Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Kagiso Rabada, Washington SundarKarim JanatA dry and hot afternoon is expected in Ahmedabad, with temperatures hovering between 33°C and 41°C.

Bombay Sport Exchange Episode 3: Kane Williamson exclusive on NextGen cricketers to watch out for

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants edged Rajasthan Royals by just two runs in a dramatic IPL 2025 clash at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, thanks to a nerveless final over from Avesh Khan that turned a seemingly straightforward chase into a heartbreaker for the home crowd.Chasing 181, Rajasthan Royals were well in the hunt needing just nine runs off the last over with six wickets in hand.Set batters Shimron Hetmyer and Dhruv Jurel were at the crease, and with the dew settling in and umpires opting to change the ball, it looked like a formality.But Avesh Khan had other plans.The over began with a sharp yorker that Jurel could only flick for a single. Then came a wide, angled delivery to Hetmyer, yielding just two after a misfield.On the third ball, Avesh outfoxed Hetmyer with a full, straight delivery. The West Indian tried to flick it but picked out Shardul Thakur at backward square leg. It was a massive breakthrough that shifted the momentum.New batter Shubham Dubey was greeted with a toe-crushing yorker for a dot. Pressure mounted.The fifth ball, which was supposed to be a yorker, came as a full toss, and Dubey launched it high over long-on, but fortune favoured the batter as David Miller dropped a straightforward chance. Two runs were taken.With four needed off the final ball, Dubey drilled it straight back.The ball struck Avesh's hand and deflected away, but not far enough. Just a single was managed. Game over.LSG had pulled off a thrilling heist, winning by two runs and sparking wild celebrations.Avesh finished with figures of 3/37, but it was his final over -- full of composure, execution, and nerves of steel -- that will be remembered.

Playoffs Prediction

NEW DELHI: Ever since the retentions were announced, Rajasthan Royals (RR) became a hot topic of discussion -- but for all the wrong reasons.Almost everyone was surprised when they let go of star players like Jos Buttler , Trent Boult, and Yuzvendra Chahal, while choosing to retain the likes of Dhruv Jurel, Shimron Hetmyer, and Riyan Parag Now, after seven games, the Royals find themselves in the bottom half of the table. So how has their campaign gone so far? Jofra Archer had a nightmare start to the season, conceding 76 runs in his 4 overs against SRH. It was the most expensive spell in IPL history as he went wicketless in his first two games.But ever since then, Archer has looked close to his best. He’s bowled brilliantly in the powerplay and has been one of the few bright spots for RR in recent matches.Beyond Archer, the bowling lineup has looked all over the place.Tushar Deshpande has been leaking runs, and the Sri Lankan spin duo of Maheesh Theekshana and Wanidu Hasaranga hasn’t come close to replicating the success that Chahal and Ashwin brought to the team.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? In the batting department, inconsistency has plagued the top order.Openers Jaiswal and Samson have scored 233 and 224 runs respectively across 7 games.While Jaiswal has managed three fifties, Samson has struggled to convert his starts, with the exception of a strong knock in the season opener.Riyan Parag, who was expected to build on his form from last season, hasn’t delivered, and Jurel too hasn’t lived up to expectations.To realistically qualify for the playoffs, the Royals would need to win six out of their remaining seven matches — a tall task.While not impossible, the chances of such a turnaround are slim. As things stand, RR would need something close to a miracle to stay alive in the race for a playoff spot.","Rajasthan Royals are in the bottom half of the IPL table.
