After South Africa ended Afghanistan's fairytale run in the T20 World Cup with a nine-wicket hammering in the semifinal at Trinidad, all eyes are on the skies in Guyana where rain threatens to play spoilsport in the second semi-final between India and defending champions England.While the temperature is expected to remain in the early thirties through the day, it's the possibility of rain and thunderstorms that remains a cause of worry, especially since there is no reserve day allocated to the second semifinal.However, according to the tournament rules in case of a washout or no-result in the semifinals, India's top-place finish in Group 1 of the 'Super 8s' stage will take them through to the final against South Africa if rain and bad weather doesn't allow the game at the Providence Stadium to be completed.The 250 extra minutes allocated by the ICC to finish the second semifinal will give the match officials almost eight hours to constitute a game that provides a result and a winner. The scheduled start time is 10:30 am, which is 8 pm in India.The weather currently in Guyana, as shown in the below screenshot from accuweather.com, is ""partly cloudy"".However, the June 27 forecast reads ""intervals of clouds and sunshine with a couple of showers, mainly early in the day"".With extended hours of play possible in case of rain interruptions, the game may well go deep into the evening in Guyana, bringing the afternoon and evening weather into play.Here's how the Guyana weather forecast for June 27 looks like:",India face England in the second semi-final of the T20 World Cup in Guyana. There is no reserve day allocated to the second semifinal. India's top-place finish in Group 1 of the 'Super 8s' stage will take them through to the final.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111302885,imgsize-52408,width-400,resizemode-4/111302885.jpg"

Indian bowler ne cheating ki | inzamam ul haq latest on India vs Australia T20 world cup match

NEW DELHI: Responding sharply to former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq 's accusations of ball tampering by Team India during the Super 8 match against Australia, skipper Rohit Sharma emphasised that if it won’t reverse swing here, then where it will, as the Men in Blue are not playing in conditions like those in Australia or England.Rohit's remarks followed Inzamam's assertion that it's unlikely for the ball to reverse swing as early as in the 15th over of the game, hinting at suspicions that ""serious work had been done"" on the ball."" Arshdeep Singh , when he was bowling the 15th over, the ball was reversing. Is it too early (for reverse swing) with the new ball? This means the ball was ready for reverse swing by the 12th or the 13th over. Umpires should keep their eyes open (to spot) these things...If it was Pakistani bowlers (reverse swinging the ball) this would have been a big issue. We know reverse swing very well and if Arshdeep can come in the 15th over and start reversing the ball, it means some serious work had been done before,"" Inzamam had said on Pakistani news channel.Addressing the media, ahead of India's semifinal clash against England, to be played on Thursday, Rohit said: ""What can I say. Don’t you see the rough surfaces and the heat here? This isn’t Australia or England. Here the conditions will result in the ball reverse swinging in 12-15 overs. It’s happening for all teams and not us alone. Sometime people need to open their mind and think"".Not only Inzamam, but former player Saleem Malik also suggested that officials often overlook issues when it comes to India.""Inzy, I always say this, eyes are kept shut when it comes to some teams, and India is one of those teams. I remember in Zimbabwe, when Wasim (Akram) was bowling, he made it wet, and we all were surprised at it; as in how come one side was wet, and when I went and complained I was fined quite heavily,"" added Saleem Malik.India's 26-run victory over Australia played a crucial role in eliminating the Australian side from the Super 8 stage of the tournament.After avenging their 2023 ODI World Cup defeat against Australia with an impressive victory, India now aim for redemption against England as they meet in the rain-threatened T20 World Cup semi-finals at Providence Stadium in Guyana on Thursday.",Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq accused Team India of ball tampering. India skipper Rohit Sharma said the conditions in Guyana were not like those in Australia or England.

GEORGETOWN: In most parts of the West Indies, the old-fashioned way of walking down the runway to the plane still prevails. It's fun on most days, but at night with the rain lashing down, the walk to take the flight, or to deplane, can get a little tricky.On Tuesday night, a small flight of about 80 people, consisting mostly of people related to the T20 World Cup, landed in Georgetown and were greeted by persistent showers.As the passengers all dashed for the shade, one could see the tall figure of Australian umpire Rod Tucker running alongside. When somebody asked Tucker whether he would be officiating the game, he laughed: ""Well, yes, if it happens"".""If it happens."" That's the operative word on everybody's lips as India get ready to play England in Rohan Kanhai land on Thursday.It's been raining for the last couple of days in Guyana and it didn't stop through the morning on Wednesday. What the locals are hoping is that if it rains on one day, it doesn't on the other. But then, that's clutching at straws, especially when the forecast is as bad as it is for Thursday.Probably the only ones who don't care are the Indian fans who have tickets for the final in Barbados on Saturday but couldn't manage one for the semifinal here. India will make the final if it's a washout because they topped their Super 8 group.The ICC has extended the cut-off time for calling the game off by four hours than what it was earlier, but for all that to happen, the rain has to stop first. ""This is rain time in Guyana, why did they even schedule the game here? That too without a reserve day,"" mused a local in anguish.But the guys who will benefit the most if it keeps raining - the Indian team - are the ones who don't want it to happen this way. The sun came out here after the morning showers on match eve and after India completed a practice session at the quick drying Providence Stadium , captain Rohit Sharma said: ""We are not looking at a curtailed game. When we come tomorrow, we will hope that it is a full game, but if it is so, we will adapt.""This game has a lot riding on emotionally as well for the Indian team because it is their chance to get revenge on a team that had humiliated them in the 2022 T20 World Cup semis. Though the return of Jasprit Bumrah , who missed that World Cup with an injury, has been the single most important change that has happened since then, Rohit insists ""not much has changed"".""We have thought and discussed and thrashed out numerous times what needs to be done. It's about keeping it going,"" the skipper said.Bumrah apart, it's Kuldeep Yadav who has been another superb inclusion once India landed in the West Indies. His quality and guile have been difficult to deal with for most opponents and England shouldn't be any exception.The defending champions, though, have a bit of firepower with the likes of Jos Buttler , Phil Salt and the rest finding some form. They have three spinners - Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone - who can make use of spin-friendly conditions in Guyana, but the biggest England supporter would say that a curtailed game would be their best chance.Man to man, on current form, India are much superior, but if it's a shorter game, many of those things go out of the window. It becomes a bit of a shootout and with rain in the air and Messrs Duckworth, Lewis and Stern calling the shots, the toss, too becomes important.India know that they may have to deal with these variables, because that's the nature of the beast these days if it's a 365-day cricket season. Rohit and Co. will believe they are good enough for whatever comes in their way as they look to break their ICC silverware drought.It will be cloudy in Guyana on Thursday with 75% probability of rain. While forecast for match hours are slightly better, if it rains heavily before the starts, it can have an impact. With an inefficient stadium drainage system, many hours could be lost.There is no reserve day for this game. However, play can extend to 4 hours and 10 minutes to complete the game. India advance in case of a washout.Providence Stadium is a spinner's haven with low, sharp turn on offer. Spinners have conceded less than 7 runs per over here in recent times, good news for India's spin troika - Kuldeep, Axar and Jadeja. England too boast of Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone in their ranks for this day game.In the previous WC game here, West Indies struggled to chase down PNG's 137, with the variable bounce raising eyebrows. Don't expect the ball to come on to the bat and expect the surface to play a few tricks.This is precisely what India didn't do in Adelaide last time around. If Rohit Sharma can reprise his heroics against Australia, India will be home free.On paper, England have more six-hitters in the lineup but India's middle order enforcers like Suryakumar Yadav , Rishabh Pant and Shivam Dube will worry the England attack.India have been traditionally shaky in knockout rounds. But the current England white-ball dispensation too is under pressure after the failure to defend the ODI World Cup last year.",India face England in T20 World Cup semifinal in Guyana on Thursday. Rain forecast for Guyana with 75% probability of rain. ICC has extended the cut-off time for calling the game off by four hours.

Money in the Bank is presently the most eagerly anticipated PLE. This year's event promises to be spectacular, with all matches set to deliver high-octane wrestling action that takes the excitement to the next level. While Money in the Bank consistently features top-notch MITB ladder matches annually, there are unforgettable bouts that stand out as the very best in Money in the Bank history.Let's explore these standout matches below.In 2012, WWE Money in the Bank stands out as one of the greatest events due to its dual MITB ladder matches, one from RAW and one from SmackDown, each offering opportunities for championship contracts. The first match saw Dolph Ziggler triumph over seven rivals to secure the World Heavyweight Championship contract. Later that evening, Ziggler capitalized on his opportunity, defeating Del Rio to claim his second World Heavyweight Championship after nearly nine months of holding the briefcase.In the event's final match, John Cena secured the MITB briefcase. However, his attempt to capitalize on it was thwarted at Raw 1000, where interference from Big Show caused CM Punk to retain the WWE Championship via disqualification, leaving Cena unable to claim the title.In WWE Money in the Bank 2014, the highly anticipated MITB ladder match featured a lineup of memorable participants: Seth Rollins , RVD, Kofi Kingston, Dolph Ziggler, Bad News Barrett, Jack Swagger, and Dean Ambrose. Unfortunately, Bad News Barrett was sidelined due to injury, leading to Rollins stepping in as his replacement.Rollins ultimately emerged victorious in a thrilling contest, securing the coveted contract after Kane intervened on behalf of The Authority, thwarting Dean Ambrose's ladder ascent. The match itself was a spectacle, setting the stage for Rollins' later dramatic cash-in. At WrestleMania 31 in March 2015, Rollins made history by cashing in his briefcase during the championship bout between defending champion Brock Lesnar and challenger Roman Reigns, adding another layer of excitement to his MITB legacy.In 2016, the Money in the Bank ladder match was a thrilling event featuring top superstars. Among the six competitors were Kevin Owens , Alberto Del Rio, Sami Zayn, Cesaro, Dean Ambrose, and Chris Jericho. Dean Ambrose emerged victorious, earning a WWE World Heavyweight Championship match contract. Later that night, after Seth Rollins had claimed the title from Roman Reigns, Ambrose seized the opportunity and successfully cashed in his contract to become the new champion.WrestleMania 21 showcased the inaugural Money in the Bank (MITB) ladder match, featuring Edge , Shelton Benjamin, Kane, Chris Jericho, Christian, and Chris Benoit. This match is still hailed as an instant classic, known for its over-the-top moments and extreme wrestling style, with superstars executing high-flying, risk-taking moves from the ladder.Edge emerged victorious, holding onto the contract until New Year's Revolution in January 2006. There, he cashed in his MITB contract against WWE Champion John Cena, who had just defended his title in an Elimination Chamber match. Edge defeated Cena to become WWE Champion, quickly establishing the precedent of ""cashing in"" on a vulnerable champion.WrestleMania 22 featured the inaugural Money in the Bank ladder match, an intense and spectacular showdown where superstars gave their all, making it one of the best Money in the Bank matches ever. Rob Van Dam emerged victorious by pushing Shelton Benjamin and Matt Hardy off a ladder and retrieving the briefcase.In May 2006, Van Dam announced he would cash in his contract at ECW One Night Stand against Cena in an Extreme Rules match. The match concluded with Cena losing after Edge interfered with a spear, and Van Dam finishing with a Five Star Frog Splash.",WrestleMania 22 features the inaugural Money in the Bank ladder match.

This time they fell way short, as India braved the conditions to pull off a 68-run victory that will leave them mentally on top ahead of their final against South Africa in Barbados on Saturday.India scored 171-5 after being asked to bat first when the conditions were infinitely more difficult. The total was way over par on a pitch that had a lot in it for the bowlers. In reply, England folded for 103 in a mere 16.4 overs, with Kuldeep Yadav , Axar Patel and Jasprit Bumrah all causing major damage.Bumrah and Axar broke the back of England within the Powerplay, getting the dangerous Jos Buttler and Phil Salt out, and the rest was just one way traffic. England didn't have anything in their lineup which could make a match of this chase against the allround brilliance of this Indian bowling attack.The locals had stayed away from the game, the West Indies defeat and the decision to have a day game on a week-day were good enough to make them go about their lives instead of spending a day at the cricket ground. But there were a few thousand Indian fans who flew in from different parts of the world and they enjoyed every moment of this joy-ride which seemed like a marathon, courtesy, the rain.The first innings took a record four hours to be bowled amidst the numerous stoppages and that halted India's momentum significantly on a pitch that was as it is difficult to bat on. And when Virat Kohli failed again, getting bowled trying to hit a cross-batted shot, one felt that things might just get tough. But then, there was a Rohit Sharma.The skipper knows this will probably be his last chance to win a limited-overs ICC trophy --both as a captain and as a player. There's been an element of determination in every step that he has taken so far, and it wasn't any different on Thursday. Rohit showed during the course of his 57 off 39 balls his incredible ability to alter his style, and yet be effective. He knew that the game that he played in St. Lucia against Australia wasn't possible on this pitch, so he didn't try to throw his hands at every ball. Here he played the waiting game and the odd loose ball was dealt with.In Suryakumar Yadav , he got the absolute perfect man who could help him steady the ship through choppy waters without compromising on the speed of the boat. The two ran furiously and played the odd innovative shot against the likes of leggie Aadil Rashid (1-25), who used the conditions very well to keep the duo in check. It was Rashid's perseverance that helped him get the wicket of Rohit, when he tried to dispatch his googly out of the park.For the innings to get a final surge of momentum, it was necessary for Surya to carry on. But the best batsman in T20 cricket too was done in by the slowness of the track and Jofra Archer's change of pace, giving a catch at the deep.But by then India had enough in the bag.","India score 171-5 after being asked to bat first.

to be fairer

GEORGETOWN: The wait kept getting longer. The world's eyes were on the weather radar and as the clouds seemed to keep moving away, the smiles were back on the faces of the fans who have been trooping into Guyana from across the United States and other parts of the world. The toss got delayed, the super-soppers were on, but nothing mattered more than the hot sun that was burning in full glory after morning showers.But as the teams got on to the field and started to prepare themselves for a long day, quite a few questions about how the tournament has been scheduled surfaced.To start with, there is no reserve day between games in the knock-out stage, which is beyond belief for anybody who is associated with cricket in this part of the world. To compensate for that, the rule of the tournament was amended at the 11th hour, with two days to go for the match, allowing four hours of extra time.Pakistan, who had been knocked out in Lauderdale because their game could not be started despite a hot sun blazing through the day, are justified to ask a few questions after rules got amended before the semis.While that's one issue, the fact that India knew way before the World Cup started that their semifinal would be played in Guyana has also come up for discussion. India captain Rohit Sharma tried to shut it down saying that ""it's the same for all teams"" and that ""England have enough experience of playing in these conditions"", the theory that India got a bit of unfair advantage cannot be disputed.Former England captain Michael Vaughan didn't mince his words when he said that the T20 World Cup is ""purely set up for India"" and ICC should have been a bit more ""fairer"" to other countries because this is not a bilateral event.""Well, it's their tournament isn't it? Literally it's that. You know that. They get to play whenever they want, they know where their semifinal is, they play every single game in the morning so people can watch them at night, obviously in India on TV,"" Vaughan said during a podcast with Australian great Adam Gilchrist on the YouTube channel Club Prairie Fire.The Ashes-winning captain feels it is purely the financial might of Indian cricket that has led to such a situation. ""I get that money is a big play, and I get that in bilateral series but when you get to a World Cup, the ICC should be a little bit fairer to everybody. There can't be sympathy or any kind of sway towards one team and this tournament is purely set up for India,"" Vaughan said.","Former England captain Michael Vaughan says T20 World Cup is ""purely set up for India"" ICC should have been a bit more ""fairer"" to other countries because this is not a bilateral event, says Vaughan.

Worked very hard as a unit and it was a great effort from all. We adapted really well, conditions were challenging. That's been the success story for us so far. If bowlers and batters adapt, things fall in place. At one stage, 140-150 looked par. But we got runs in the middle, SKY and I were going and thought we can get 20-25 more. I didn't want to give that away, wanted to let the batters play on instinct. 175 was a very good score, bowlers were fantastic. Axar, Kuldeep are gun spinners.

Whether he'll continue to do that in the semifinal, because this is a guy who has taken up the responsibility on the big stage, he feels that he's the guy who's got to do it. Plus he's short of runs. The thing to look for is if he's hit a four or a six and if he picks a single, then you know that he's batting a little differently,"" Manjrekar said.Team India is looking to win their first major title in over a decade and bury any doubts about their backbone in the knockout rounds.Rohit's team head into Thursday's semis in Guyana on a six-match unbeaten streak in the tournament and determined to emulate the title success of the 2007 side in the inaugural edition.",India lost 10-wicket mauling at the hands of England in 2022 T20 World Cup semis.

NEW DELHI: India is on the cusp of a significant milestone as they prepare to face defending champions England in the Twenty20 World Cup semi-finals on Thursday in Guyana .A victory would not only propel them closer to their first major title in over a decade but also silence any doubts about their ability to perform in knockout rounds.Despite the backing of the world's wealthiest cricket board, India has struggled to achieve consistent success on the global stage, with their most recent triumph being the 2013 Champions Trophy.Rohit Sharma 's team enters the match against England riding a six-match unbeaten streak in the tournament, determined to replicate the success of the 2007 side that won the inaugural edition. Rohit, along with Virat Kohli, both of whom may be playing in their last World Cup, has found form with a blistering 92 off 41 balls against Australia in the Super Eight stage and has emphasized the team's aggressive approach.However, Indian fans remain apprehensive due to the team's inconsistent performances in the latter stages of major tournaments. They suffered semi-final exits in the 2019 50-overs World Cup against New Zealand and the 2022 T20 World Cup against England. Additionally, they faced heartbreak in the 2023 World Test Championship final and the 2023 ODI World Cup title decider, both losses coming against Australia.Despite these setbacks, India appears to be in excellent form with both bat and ball in this tournament. Rohit has amassed 191 runs in six matches, while pace bowlerJasprit Bumrah has claimed 11 wickets, and spinner Kuldeep Yadav, a late addition to the team, has taken seven wickets in three games.England's campaign, on the other hand, has been inconsistent, with losses to Australia and South Africa in the group stages. They narrowly advanced to the Super Eights due to a superior net run rate compared to Scotland. However, they now stand just two wins away from becoming the first team to successfully defend the T20 World Cup trophy.The pressure is on skipper Jos Buttler and coach Matthew Mott to deliver, and they will rely on the performances of West Indies-born pacers Jofra Archer and Chris Jordan in the knockout rounds. Buttler and opener Phil Salt have been England's top scorers, with 191 and 183 runs, respectively, and their form will be crucial to the team's success.The winner of the India-England semi-final will face the victor of the first semi-final South Africa in final, which takes place on Saturday.As the T20 World Cup 2024 approaches its climax, India (IND) is set to face England (ENG) in the second semi-final match. The game will take place on June 27 at 8:00 PM IST at the Providence Stadium in Guyana, West Indies.In their head-to-head T20I encounters, India and England have played 23 matches, with India holding a slight advantage of 12 wins compared to England's 11 victories.The Providence Stadium in Guyana has offered a balanced playing surface throughout the tournament. The pitch has favoured the batsmen, particularly in the first innings, while the bowlers have also played a crucial role in shaping the outcome of the matches.Providence Stadium has hosted five matches in the T20 World Cup 2024, with three matches won by the team batting first and two by the team batting second. The average first innings total at this venue is 146, while the average second innings total is significantly lower at 77. The highest recorded total is 183/5 by Afghanistan against Uganda, and the lowest is 39/10 by Uganda against West Indies.For fantasy cricket, it is advisable to wait for the toss and then select impactful batters from the team that bats first. Pacers have shown greater efficiency on this pitch, but spinners can also be effective.

NEW DELHI: Former India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh 's iconic six sixes still remain fresh in everyone's memory after 17 long years, and the man himself hasn't forgotten an inch of that epic moment when he smacked England pacer Stuart Broad half a dozen times out of the park.While recalling that historic feat in a video interview with ICC , Yuvraj said, ""In the last couple of innings I didn't do well so I was very keen to get out there and get some big hits and some kind of form.It was the 19th over and I had to swing everything.Freddie ( Andrew Flintoff ) bowled two really good balls actually and on the last ball of the 18th over I took a single. (Few words were exchanged between the two of them). And I was just like. I am sorry, what did you say? Obviously I was angry then the umpire came in. Anyways I was furious. I was so furious that I just wanted to hit every ball out of the ground. The first ball went out of the park. I remember hitting this one without even realising how big that hit is.""When the anchor asked Yuvraj that after hitting four sixes to Broad, do you have six sixes in mind at that point? To which he replied after taking a big breath,"" No, I have actually five sixes in my mind since I was hit for five sixes by Dimitri Mascrenahas in the final over of the 2007 Oval ODI. It was very demeaning as well. You don't want to get hit for five sixes. I had been in this place and getting hit for 5 sixes is not a good feeling.I was like Dimitri was standing at deep mid-wicket and Flintoff was at deep square leg. I know where he was standing. Here what happened was Broad actually switched to over the stumps at the last moment. When he did that, in my mind I was like I knew where he was going to bowl. I was ready that it was going to be a full yorker towards my legs, and I just wanted to get my bat on it.""On being nervous before the sixth and final six, Yuvraj said, ""I was not nervous at all. He (Broad) was the one who was nervous as I can see his body language. If you will see there was a smile on my face at that moment, and that smile was for Dimitri. I normally bat at No. 4 and MS Dhoni at No. 4 and after I hit the final six, MS said to me that everytime you come out to bat after me your strike rate is double.The great thing about Freddie is he talked about it after the game and shook hands, and that is why I have a lot of respect for Flintoff. (On Broad) I think that was a big moment of his career because he knew from here on he had to add more variety in his bowling. He just can't come and bowl yorkers. He has to bowl slower balls, bouncers. Obviously he was young and learning as well. And from there on he went on to take 600 Test wickets. I don't think without this moment, he would have ended up with 600 wickets. This moment probably made him work harder and realise how important it is to succeed. Definitely this is the moment that made him a legend.""""Ya, this was one of the iconic moments and I cherish it but if we wouldn't have won the World Cup, it wouldn’t have been that special I guess,"" concluded Yuvraj.Yuvraj's blistering innings came to an end when he was caught at long-on off the penultimate delivery of the final over, having amassed a stunning 58 runs from a mere 16 balls.

CHENNAI: It is over six months since the Indian women's cricket team wore the white flannels, while the South Africans have played red-ball cricket twice in as many years. Test matches for women are far and few in between, but that does not take the sheen away from it.The stage is set for the one-off Test match between the two sides starting at the MA Chidambaram Stadium from Friday.India-high on confidence after sweeping the ODI series-will assert their supremacy in the longest format, with spin being their trump card.The Chepauk surface is known to assist spinners and captain Harmanpreet Kaur expects the ball to turn from the final session of the opening day. ""We don't have much experience in Chennai. The last couple of practice sessions gave us ideas. We have watched men play here, but women's cricket is totally different. The pace of the ball and the way we bat vary. As the match begins, we'll see how the wicket behaves, adapt to it and make decisions,"" explained the top-order bat.India don't start favourites merely on paper. Instead, they will play to their strengths and look to exploit the chinks in the Proteas game.In India's last Test against Australia in Dec, opener Smriti Mandhana and spinners Sneh Rana and Rajeshwari Gayakwad starred in the eight-wicket win. Smriti heads into the contest after delivering a stellar show in the ODIs. In the three matches, the southpaw's scores read 117, 136 and 90. The line-up in bolstered by the presence of Harmanpreet, Shafali Verma and Jemimah Rodrigues.On the bowling front, Renuka Singh Thakur is expected to be incharge of the new ball. But the focus will be on how the spin troika of Deepti Sharma, Rajeshwari and Sneh turn it on the favourable red-soil track.The visitors will have more to worry about than the spin-friendly conditions. South Africa last played a Test match against Australia in February in which they were handed a heavy innings and 284-run defeat. To make matters worse, the visitors are still searching for their first win on this tour.South Africa skipper Laura Wolvaardt admitted to the team's lack of preparation.""We don't play domestic cricket. So, just coming straight into an international multi-day game is difficult. I guess the women's Test in general is a bit of an unknown for both teams. Neither of us have experience in it.

till now?

What do you think about the Indian spin-attack, and more specifically Kuldeep Yadav?

You were a top finger-spinner yourself. Do you think the role of finger spinners is diminishing in white-ball cricket?

Who according to you is the best white-ball spinner at the moment?

You played at a time when the West Indies pace quartet ruled the roost. How does it feel now to see spinners opening the attack for West Indies?

Who according to you was the best-ever player of spin?

What do you think of the modern-day trend of dishing out big turners in Tests, where it spins from ball one? Is the art of playing spin taking a beating?

How do you compare the two great modern-day offies

Nathan Lyon

and

GEORGETOWN: It wasn't easy to be a spinner in the West Indies when Roger Harper played his cricket. Those were the days of the famous pace quartet. The tall off-spinner from Guyana was seen more as a restrictive option. But he was more than effective, especially in ODIs where he got 99 wickets at an economy-rate of a phenomenal 3.97.In a chat with TOI, Harper spoke about the role of spinners in modern-day cricket, his admiration for Kuldeep Yadav and a lot more besides.Some of the pitches have turned a bit and the spinners have been able to make an impact. Some of the boundaries have been slightly bigger as well and the batsmen have not been able to dominate all the time, which I think has been a welcome relief.I think they have come here with the idea that they will have to play against a lot of right-handers. So they have taken three left-arm spinners in the playing XI. But they have been able to make an impact. As for Kuldeep, he is a left-arm wrist-spinner and there is a little bit of mystery about him. Batsmen find it difficult to read him. The fact that he is a left-armer helps him create more challenges and he can be a wicket-taker at times.The role of the finger-spinner is often to come in the middle of the innings, stop the runs and take wickets. Wrist-spinners provide more difficulty because they can probably be a little harder to read. But finger-spinners have bowled well in this World Cup, with Roston Chase of the West Indies being one of them. The finger-spinner still has a significant role to play, provided he knows how to adapt to different situations and bowl accordingly.Probably Rashid Khan . He has proven time and time again that he has the ability to take wickets. Batsmen sometimes get a hold of him, but he is difficult to hit and he takes wickets. So, he has to be up there.Firstly, I keep emotion out of it and see how conditions are and what can be done accordingly. In this World Cup, spinners are proving very successful at the top of the order, somebody like an Aiden Markram, who is a part-timer, bowls four overs at the top of the innings. It is about conditions, situations, and I am happy that spinners are playing a very big role. And don't forget this is not Test cricket. I don't think West Indies open too often with spin in Tests, unless they are playing on absolute turners.I always felt Sunil Gavaskar looked very broad but Javed Miandad was brilliant too. He had the ability to nudge the ball and find the single. Javed Miandad too was really challenging to bowl to.Back in our day too, there were pitches where the ball turned pretty early. What is more important is that the bounce has to be consistent so that it is a fair challenge between bat and ball. Now the approach has changed. Years ago the focus was about occupying the crease and accumulating runs. Some of the highly-skilled players could not score that fast. These days the urgency is to keep the scoreboard ticking, but having said that, some of the shots the England players played in India during the Tests a couple of months ago were horrendous. The mental attitude about playing spin has changed.Both have more than 500 Test wickets... I wouldn't want to say who is the better bowler. They are different and I admire both of them. Lyon is more the orthodox off-spinner who will plug away and bowl consistently, get turn and bounce and vary his pace. Ashwin spins the ball as well and gets turn and his carrom ball adds mystery and intrigue. Both have the ability to bowl long spells and can get on top of a team and run through the batting line-ups.","Former WI off-spinner tells TOI why it is important for offies to adapt to different situations.

He focused on delivering the ball in the optimal areas of the pitch to maximize his effectiveness.""I have bowled in the powerplay in the past, so I had to bowl in the powerplay, that was the plan. The wicket was stopping and keeping low, so tried to bowl in the right areas. The wicket was slow, so I tried to bowl slower in this match, it worked for me.

On the other hand, the defeat resulted in the Czech Republic's exit from the tournament.Despite their efforts and a history of reaching the quarter-finals in the previous tournament, the Czech team's aspirations were significantly hindered by the early dismissal of midfielder Antonin Barak , who received a second yellow card in the 20th minute.The match concluded with heightened tensions, leading to Tomas Chory of the Czech Republic receiving a red card during a post-game altercation. The game was notable for the high number of cards issued by the referee, totalling 18, including two red and 16 yellow cards, setting a new record for the Euros.The encounter was characterized by aggressive play from both teams, with the Turkish team enjoying substantial support from their fans, reflecting their large diaspora in Germany.The atmosphere was intense and the competition fierce, despite the challenging hot conditions. Hakan Calhanoglu , at 30 years old, scored his first goal in his third Euros participation in the 50th minute, a moment that ignited the Turkish supporters.His goal came from a low shot that not only bypassed the Czech goalkeeper Jindrich Stanek but also resulted in Stanek sustaining a shoulder injury, forcing him to leave the game.A missed opportunity by Turkey's Arda Guler to extend their lead was quickly followed by an equalizer from the Czech Republic, with Tomas Soucek scoring in the 66th minute amidst a chaotic scene following a long throw.The match's intensity continued to build until Cenk Tosun scored the decisive goal for Turkey in stoppage time, eliciting jubilant celebrations from the Turkish bench and fans alike. This victory was particularly meaningful for Turkey, helping to overcome the disappointment of their performance at Euro 2020, where they were eliminated in the group stage.Turkey, finishing second in Group F behind Portugal, are set to play Austria on July 2 in Leipzig.

They achieved this feat by defeating Portugal, a team that previously won the Eruo, with a scoreline of 2-0.The victory was primarily orchestrated through an early goal from Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and a penalty converted by Georges Mikautadze .Despite facing a Portugal side that fielded many of their reserve players, having already qualified for the next round, this triumph is considered Georgia's most significant achievement since gaining independence in 1991.Georgia's journey to Euro 2024 was not straightforward. After finishing fourth in their qualifying group, they had to navigate through the Euro Nations tournament, where they topped their group before overcoming Greece in a playoff.This backdrop makes their group stage performance and progression to the knockout rounds even more commendable. Under the guidance of Coach Willy Sagnol , a former defender for Bayern Munich and France, Georgia not only advanced but also secured a third-place finish in Group F, setting up a last-16 clash with Spain, a team that has won the Euro tournament three times.The implications of Georgia's victory extend beyond their own achievements. It has also determined the matchups for other teams in the round of 16, with England facing Slovakia, Romania taking on the Netherlands, and Portugal meeting Slovenia. Hungary, who were contenders for advancement, were ultimately eliminated.Georgia's assertive start in the match was highlighted by Kvaratskhelia's goal in the second minute, following a mistake from Portugal's Antonio Silva.Cristiano Ronaldo , despite his efforts and the historical significance of potentially becoming the oldest goal-scorer in Euro tournament history, could not influence the game's outcome.Georgia's defence remained impenetrable, effectively neutralizing Portugal's attempts to score, and their strategy to exploit counter-attacking opportunities was further validated when Silva's foul led to a penalty, confirmed after a VAR review. Mikautadze's successful penalty not only secured the win but also made him the tournament's leading scorer at that point.The match saw Ronaldo, visibly frustrated, receive a booking for dissent and later express his disappointment by kicking a water bottle following his substitution. Georgia's goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili played a crucial role in the final moments to preserve the lead, culminating in jubilant celebrations from the Georgian players and coaching staff at the final whistle, witnessed by thousands of their supporters.","Georgia secured their passage to the knockout stages in what is their inaugural appearance at the European Championship.

Andy Murray , a former Wimbledon champion, has returned to training following a recent back surgery as he prepares for the upcoming grasscourt Grand Slam. However, the 37-year-old stated on Thursday that he would carefully consider his participation and take as much time as needed before making a final decision.The ATP , the governing body for men's tennis, had initially announced on Sunday through a social media post that Murray would not be competing in the tournament.The post was later deleted, and Britain's Davis Cup captain Leon Smith clarified that ""no decision had been made.""""I'm going to wait until the last minute to see if I'm going to be able to play and I've earned the right to do that,"" Reuters quoted Murray's statement shared by his management team.""This isn't clearcut where I'm 100% going to be ready to play or there's a 0% chance I can play.
