NEW DELHI: As India prepare to take on New Zealand in their opening Group A match of the Women's T20 World Cup on Friday, the pressure is on skipper Harmanpreet Kaur and her senior stars to deliver a strong start. With past near-misses haunting the team, most notably their loss to Australia in the 2020 final, the Women in Blue are determined to overcome their mental fragility and aim for a deep run in the tournament.Harmanpreet, likely playing in her last T20 World Cup, has been central to India's rise but has also experienced heartbreak in pivotal moments.The Indian side, brimming with talent, stands toe-to-toe with top contenders like Australia, but unlike the six-time champions, India still lack a major ICC title.The key challenge for India has often been faltering at clutch moments in global events. To combat this, the team held a preparatory camp at the National Cricket Academy (NCA), including counseling sessions to address their mental toughness. However, as any seasoned athlete knows, external help only goes so far, and it will come down to India's ability to execute flawlessly on the field.In their opening match against New Zealand, a team that might not be as formidable as Australia but remains tough and competitive, India will need to be at their best. A victory could signal India’s tactical and mental readiness for the tournament, especially in a group that includes heavyweights like Australia, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan.For India to make a strong start, the contributions of senior players are essential. Skipper Harmanpreet, Smriti Mandhana, Jemimah Rodrigues, Shafali Verma, and Deepti Sharma are expected to lead from the front.India’s spin-heavy bowling attack could be their trump card, given the likely weariness of the tracks. With only three pacers — Renuka Singh, Pooja Vastrakar, and Arundhati Reddy — India will likely depend heavily on their variety of spinners.New Zealand, however, are no pushovers. Led by talismanic skipper Sophie Devine, with seasoned campaigners Suzie Bates, Lea Tahuhu, and Leigh Kasperek, the Kiwis boast a strong core. The presence of young all-rounder Amelia Kerr adds dynamism to their squad, though they might rely heavily on their more experienced players.The highly anticipated opening match of the Indian team will take place on October 4 at 7:30 PM IST at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium , Dubai.Throughout their T20I history , India and New Zealand have faced each other on 13 occasions, with New Zealand holding a statistical edge, winning nine of them. India have just four wins under their belt.On the current form, India have the edge as they have won seven of their last 10 matches, with one no result, whereas New Zealand have lost all their last 10 matches coming into the contest.The Dubai has historically provided a balanced track, with equal opportunities for both batters and bowlers. And for night matches, the Dubai pitch has favoured chasing teams, with dew often playing a role under the lights, making it tougher for bowlers in the second innings.From a fantasy cricket perspective, the pitch report indicates that batting conditions are optimal at the beginning of the innings when the ball is hard and new, more so while batting first. Therefore, selecting the top three batters from both teams can be a strategic advantage in fantasy contests. Additionally, new ball bowlers can use the conditions better before dews make their presence felt..India’s top-order batter is one of the consistent run-scorers in the game and is coming into the contest riding on good form.India’s swashbuckling opener is known for her big shots and can destroy any attack with his aggressive style of batting.the experienced New Zealand all-rounder and captain is a proven match winner and can contribute handsomely with both bat and ball.India squad: Harmanpreet Kaur (c), Smriti Mandhana, Shafali Verma, Deepti Sharma, Jemimah Rodrigues, Richa Ghosh, Yastika Bhatia (subject to fitness), Pooja Vastrakar, Arundhati Reddy, Renuka Singh Thakur, Dayalan Hemalatha, Asha Sobhana, Radha Yadav, Shreyanka Patil (subject to fitness), Sajana SajeevanUma Chetry (wk), Tanuja Kanwer, Saima Thakor.Sophie Devine (c), Suzie Bates, Eden Carson, Izzy Gaze, Maddy Green, Brooke Halliday, Fran Jonas, Leigh Kasperek, Melie Kerr, Jess Kerr, Rosemary Mair, Molly Penfold, Georgia Plimmer, Hannah Rowe, Lea Tahuhu.Smriti Mandhana, Shafali Verma, Suzie Bates, Harmanpreet KaurSophie Devine, Deepti Sharma, Amelia KerrRicha GhoshRadha Yadav, Renuka Singh Thakur, Leigh Kasperek.","India take on New Zealand in their opening Group A match of the Women's T20 World Cup on Friday.

Hilarious! Aussie players unanimously name Rishabh Pant as India's top sledger,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/hilarious-aussie-players-unanimously-name-rishabh-pant-as-indias-top-sledger/articleshow/113943872.cms,"NEW DELHI: Sledging has been a hallmark of the India vs Australia Test cricket rivalry, adding a layer of intensity to their encounters. Australian teams, known for their aggressive on-field tactics, often employed verbal exchanges to unsettle opponents.India, initially more restrained, began to respond in kind, especially under captains like Sourav Ganguly and Virat Kohli , who encouraged a more combative approach.India not only triumphed in their last two tours Down Under but also matched the Australians in the art of sledging. Rishabh Pant , in particular, gave the hosts a run for their own money, with his behind-the-wickets taunts aimed at Australian batters becoming major talking points of the tour.In a video shared by Star Sports on their X handle, Australian players were asked to name the Indian player who sledges and banters the most. The unanimous choice among all players was Rishabh Pant, leaving the anchor in splits.In the video, Pant clarified that he never sledges with a particular purpose but does it because he enjoys it. He also revealed that during the team's meeting with the Australian Prime Minister, even the PM recognized him, saying, ""You're the one who sledges.""The highly anticipated five-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy will begin in Perth on November 22, followed by matches in Adelaide (a pink-ball game), Brisbane, Melbourne, and Sydney.India's recent Test series win against Bangladesh has strengthened their position atop the World Test Championship (WTC) standings, with eight wins, two losses, and one draw, amassing 98 points and a points percentage of 74.24.If India goes on to defeat New Zealand 3-0 at home, they will secure their place in the WTC final at Lord's in June 2025 before even heading to Australia. The Border-Gavaskar Trophy will then be a contest of pride, with the world's No. 1 team aiming to retain the series.","Rishabh Pant named Australian player who sledges and banters the most.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Mohammad Kaif has expressed strong support for a new rule change in Indian Premier League (IPL) that could potentially benefit MS Dhoni , allowing the former Chennai Super Kings CSK ) captain to continue playing in the IPL beyond 2024.Under this rule, players who have not represented the Indian national team for five years will be treated as ""uncapped"" players, regardless of their past achievements.Dhoni, who last played for India in the 2019 World Cup, qualifies under this reclassification for the 2025 IPL season.Speaking on Star Sports, Kaif voiced his approval for this adjustment, emphasizing Dhoni's immense influence on the game.""You will get the chance to see MS Dhoni again. He is fit, batting at a strike rate of 200, keeping well, and that is why I believe the rules will keep changing till he wishes to play. If he wants to play in the IPL, he will play. He is such a big player, such a big match-winner, and has been a leader for CSK,"" Kaif said.Furthermore, Kaif noted how the financial aspect doesn't concern Dhoni.He referenced Dhoni's own words, “I believe the rule has been changed rightly. And Dhoni himself says, 'I don’t need money, I’ll adjust to whatever the team decides.' Even if he gets 4 crore as an uncapped player (Paise chahe 4 crore mil rahe ho as an uncapped player), it doesn't matter to him. It sounds strange to say because 4 crore isn't much for him. Everyone knows the rule has been changed for Dhoni sahab, and why not, you will want to change the rule for a player like Dhoni.""Earlier, the IPL governing council, in its recent meeting in Bengaluru, approved this rule change for the 2025-2027 cycle, allowing teams to retain up to six players before the auction.This move has raised excitement among fans as it paves the way for Dhoni’s possible return as an uncapped player.With the auction purse increased to Rs 120 crore, the new rule not only enhances teams’ strategic options but also gives CSK a chance to hold on to their iconic leader.","Former Indian cricketer Mohammad Kaif has expressed strong support for a new rule change in Indian Premier League.

NEW DELHI: Harmanpreet Kaur-led India are gearing up to face New Zealand in their opening Group A match of the Women's T20 World Cup at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Friday. This marks the ninth edition of the tournament, with India still chasing their maiden T20 World Cup title. Their closest opportunity came in 2020 when they reached the final but were defeated by a dominant Australian side at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.Determined to put past disappointments behind them, India will look for a strong start to their campaign as they set their sights on erasing the memories of previous near-misses.Ahead of India's opening clash against New Zealand in Dubai, TimesofIndia.com spoke with Harmanpreet during an event hosted by Puma India. The Indian captain shared her thoughts on the team's title prospects, potential combinations, and more. Edited excerpts:You are putting pressure on us by saying this (laughs). We are really excited and want to give our best. The team has done really well and prepared a lot for this big tournament. We will not leave a single stone unturned. We are positive, and I am confident we will come through with flying colors.Yes, hopefully. That's our aim. As I said, we are prepared, we are positive, and we just want to go out and give our best. We always talk in the dressing room about how this is a great opportunity for us. I tell my team one thing: go and enjoy your game. That's it.If you ask me as a captain, all players are equally important to me. They have different roles to play on the field, and I know what they can bring to the table. For me, every single player is important. Whoever is in the middle must take responsibility and win the game for us.Earlier, the tournament was going to be played in Bangladesh, and now it will be held in the UAE. The conditions will be tough, and I will adjust the combinations accordingly.That's quite natural. It's not something exaggerated or out of the box. The aggression in me is natural. It drives me forward, and that’s how I've always been. Whenever I'm on the field, I just want to see my team win. This is the mindset I’ve played with throughout.Yes. She is the heart of the team. She’s always cheerful and ensures the dressing room environment remains lively. She keeps a big smile on every single player's face. It's really good to have her on the side. It's always great to have such players who bring energy to the team and the dressing room.It’s helping us a lot, just like the IPL helps men’s cricket. We've been waiting for this league for so many years. It's a massive platform for all women's cricketers. The WPL is a great stage and has brought a lot of talent to Indian cricket. I really loved playing in the WPL. Personally, this is something I’ve been waiting for a long time.

ISL: Borja’s left foot to Goa’s rescue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/isl-borjas-left-foot-to-goas-rescue/articleshow/113949169.cms,"FC Goa players cannot hide their disappointment after missing a late chance to score the winner at Fatorda on Friday

Margao: During the pre-match media interaction, Manolo Marquez spoke fondly of Borja Herrera ’s importance to FC Goa , or the three other teams that they’ve been together, which includes Las Palmas in LaLiga. The coach said there were not many players with his quality, particularly the strong left foot.The praise came after the hat-trick against East Bengal for Goa’s first win in the Indian Super League ( ISL ) this season.Borja’s left foot came to Manolo’s rescue again as the hosts secured a last-gasp equaliser against NorthEast United FC in a 3-3 draw at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda.The end was entertaining for Goa after Borja struck in the fourth minute of added time. The hosts almost secured a win, forcing NorthEast goalkeeper Gurmeet into two good saves deep into stoppage time. But after a cold shower, there would be a reality check: Goa are winless in two home games, they’ve surrendered the lead in successive games at Fatorda, and they’ve rarely looked like a team that is built to challenge for top honours.Here on Friday night, it all started with Nestor Albiach handing NorthEast the lead in the sixth minute. Armando Sadiku then scored in first half added time and again early in the second – just two minutes after restart – to swing the momentum in Goa’s favour. The visitors, though, were not to be left behind as Nestor scored his second and Alaeddine Ajaraie added another one to make it 3-2 with two goals between the 51st and 56th minutes.There was still plenty of time left on the clock. Goa pushed forward, created openings, but only succeeded in the fourth minute of stoppage time with Borja scoring the equaliser.The draw left Goa with just a win from four matches before the international break.“We are not happy despite equalising in the last minute,” Manolo said after the game. “We made very big mistakes in defence, not just the defenders, but the whole team. The team though showed character as we drew and were close to scoring the fourth. I think we will get better once the (injured) players return after the break.”NorthEast should have grabbed all points on offer here. They played to a plan, capitalised on their chances and for long spells left Goa doubting themselves. For a side with limited resources who have repeatedly punched above its weight this season, the dropped points will hurt.Goa cannot say they weren’t sufficiently warned about the dangers of NorthEast. It is no secret that Juan Pedro Benali’s team is fine with not having too much of the ball; here, they had only 30% ball possession yet looked comfortable. Only the red card to Robin Yadav for a double booking in the end stuck out like a sore thumb.Goa didn’t look menacing enough. With Carl McHugh suspended, Manolo chose to start with Sahil Tavora and Ayush Chhetri in midfield, as Borja, deployed just behind the striker, had to often drop deep to take the ball forward. Dejan Drazic on the left wing was a constant threat, while Boris Singh picked up pace only after the change of ends.After Nestor virtually danced his way past almost all four defensive players to score the opener, Armando equalised from the spot as Dejan won a penalty, brought down inside the box by the outstretched leg of Mohammed Ali Bemammer.Armando – who has scored in every game he has played this season – then gave Goa the lead, scoring from inside the box soon after restart. He had missed a glorious chance from close range in the first half.Two goals from NorthEast, both stemming from defensive lapses, turned the match on its head, until Borja and his appreciable left foot gave Goa something to cheer.",Borja's left foot came to Manolo's rescue again as the hosts secured a last-gasp equaliser against NorthEast United FC in a 3-3 draw at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda.

BRIEF SCORES:

It's a tough group and this wasn't the start the Indian girls were looking for. Everything went wrong for them at the Dubai International Stadium on Friday evening as the Women In Blue crashed to a 58-run loss.While fielding wasn't up to the mark when New Zealand batted, the famed Indian top-order struggled miserably on a sluggish pitch, losing early wickets in a chase of 161.It was crucial for India to have a good start, but opener Shafali Verma gave a tame return catch to offie Eden Carson in the second over.The likes of Smriti Mandhana, Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues knew that it was mandatory to have a good Powerplay to stay in the hunt. But Smriti and Harmanpreet were dismissed within the first six overs — it seemed they were struggling to read the pace of the pitch.Jemimah departed soon after and the rest was just a walk in the park for the New Zealanders. It was only the third time that India were all out in a T20 game, their innings coming to a close in the 19th over for 102. In the lead-up to the World Cup, head coach Amol Muzumdar has repeatedly emphasised the importance of fielding and fitness.Despite all the hard work that had been put in, the girls struggled in these two departments as New Zealand put up a fighting 160-4. Openers Suzie Bates and Georgia Plimmer steadily built their partnership as Indians kept misfielding and even dropped a crucial catch early on.In the final over of the Powerplay, two glaring mistakes displayed India's early struggles in the field in hot conditions. First, Renuka Singh , stationed at deep square leg, misjudged a regulation stop to allow a boundary to Plimmer. Then, Bates enjoyed a huge slice of luck on 18. A top-edged sweep went high into the air, but wicketkeeper Richa Ghosh, attempting a reverse-cup, failed to hold onto the catch.There were errors at the backend of the innings as well that helped New Zealand give India a tough target on a sluggish pitch.After Plimmer and Bates were dismissed, the class of NZ captain Sophie Devine (57*, 36b; 7x4) took over. She brought all her experience into play and used her feet well in dealing with the Indian slow bowlers. She waited for the loose balls and played some strong shots which allowed New Zealand to push their run-rate up. Devine was rebuilding the New Zealand innings with Amelia Kerr, who came in at No. 3, when the latter was handed a lifeline on 13.Kerr and Devine were going for a second run when Harmanpreet, at long-off, fired a throw to the keeper's end. Kerr was run out by Richa, while at the same time, the umpire handed back Deepti's hat at the other end. The umpire deemed the action to be over before the attempted run-out happened, leaving Harmanpreet and the support staff unhappy.Kerr did not last long after the reprieve as she was caught by Pooja Vastrakar at mid-off off Renuka Singh. However, after Kerr's departure, Devine took charge and powered NZ to a strong finish along with Brooke Halliday. The duo plundered 46 runs off 4.2 overs on a pitch where stroke-making was far from easy, and it took the game completely away from India.New Zealand 160/4 (Sophie Devine 57 not out, Georgia Plimmer 34; Renuka Singh 2/27) bt India 102 in 19 overs (Harmanpreet Kaur 15; Rosemary Mair 4/19) by 58 runs.",India were all out for 102 in the 19th over against New Zealand. Sophie Devine (57) and Brooke Halliday (46) powered New Zealand to victory. It was only the third time that India have been all out in a T20 game.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113954064,imgsize-182388,width-400,resizemode-4/113954064.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In an unusual turn of events at the T20 World Cup 2024 match between India and New Zealand in Dubai on Friday, Amelia Kerr was declared not out by the on-field umpires despite being short of her crease, as they had already signalled the end of the over.The incident unfolded when Kerr hit the ball towards long-off for a single on the last ball of the 14th over.India's captain, Harmanpreet Kaur , picked up the ball and took a few steps into the circle without throwing it.Seeing this, New Zealand skipper Sophie Devine called for a second run. However, the umpire had already handed the cap to bowler Deepti Sharma , indicating the end of the over.Realising the situation, Harmanpreet quickly threw the ball to the wicket-keeper's end, where Richa Ghosh swiftly removed the bails, catching Kerr well short of the crease.As Kerr began walking back to the dressing room, the umpires - Anna Harris and Jacqueline Williams -intervened, stating that it was a dead ball and the review was not applicable.This led to an animated discussion between Harmanpreet and the on-field umpires, with the Indian captain arguing that she only threw the ball because the New Zealand batters had taken the run. However, her arguments did not sway the umpires' decision.Team India's head coach, Amol Muzumdar , also expressed his dissatisfaction with the decision and engaged in a lengthy and animated conversation with the fourth umpire.Despite the protests, the on-field umpires remained firm in their stance that the over had been called, and Kerr was allowed to continue batting.","Amelia Kerr was declared not out by the on-field umpires despite being short of her crease, as they had already signalled the end of the over.

BRIEF SCORES:

Mumbai:

Rest of India:

LUCKNOW: Rest of India 's Abhimanyu Easwaran and Dhruv Jurel seemed to be coasting towards their respective landmarks. Abhimanyu was eyeing a double century while Jurel was inching closer to his own ton. But a couple of not-so-perfect sweep shots led to their downfall and soon after, RoI's innings spiralled out of control as they lost six wickets for 23 runs in just 10 overs to be bowled out for 416 in their first innings, handing Mumbai a 121-run lead.At stumps on Day 4, riding on Prithvi Shaw 's gutsy 76 on a track that had started wearing and spinning sharply, Mumbai reached 153/6 to extend their lead to 274 in the Irani Cup at the Ekana Stadium here on Friday.Easwaran and Jurel continued from where they had left off on Day Three and went about hunting down the Mumbai total of 537 at a decent pace. Their fifth-wicket alliance had reached 165 and was threatening to chip away at the remaining deficit quickly.But against the run of play, with just 5.3 overs to go before lunch, Mumbai decided to try something different with left-arm spinner Shams Mulani (3/122) coming over the wicket from the pavilion end. Next over, offie Tanush Kotian (3/101) conceded just one run. The RoI batters fell into the trap and in their endeavour to unsettle the spin duo, decided to go after Mulani. On the first ball of the next Mulani over, Jurel employed the sweep, but the ball kissed his gloves enroute to lodging into 'keeper Hardik Tamore's gloves. Jurel scored 93 off 121 balls, with the help of 13 fours and one six. Then 12 balls later, Easwaran too tried to sweep Mulani but could only top-edge one to Kotian, who took a diving catch coming in from short fine-leg. The Bengal opener's marathon innings of 191 from 292 balls was laced with 16 fours and one six.Once Mumbai sniffed an opportunity, they went for the kill and the RoI innings was wrapped up in six overs after lunch with three wickets falling in the 110th over bowled by Kotian. He played a role in Yash Dayal's run out, had Prasidh Krishna caught at short-leg and then took Mukesh Kumar's catch to end the RoI innings. While Mulani and Kotian helped Mumbai take the first-innings lead, it was Shaw's 105-ball innings which included eight fours and one six that helped the Ranji champions maintain their advantage.Knowing that scoring will be difficult once the spinners start operating, Mumbai raced to 50 in just 6.2 overs. But then Saransh Jain (4/67) and Manav Suthar (2/40) ran through the top-order to spice up the encounter. Just 14 wickets fell on the first three days but Friday saw 12 scalps and most of them to the spinners.Shaw stood tall among the ruins and made sure Mumbai stretched their lead. He may have dropped down the pecking order for a role as India opener, but a good season could well turn the tide in his favour. Left-arm spinner Mulani called Shaw's innings a “crucial knock” as Mumbai look to lift their first Irani Cup since 1997-98. Sarfaraz Khan (9 batting) and Kotian (20 batting) played out a tense half-an-hour towards stumps to calm the nerves in the Mumbai dressing room.537 and 153/6 (P Shaw 76, T Kotian 20 not out; S Jain 4-67, M Suthar 2-40) lead416 (A Easwaran 191, D Jurel 93; T Kotian 3-101, S Mulani 3-122) by 274 runs.","Rest of India were bowled out for 416 in their first innings, handing Mumbai a 121-run lead.

She launched a bullet throw to the keeper's end, where Richa Ghosh swiftly removed the bails, catching Kerr well short of the crease.But to the dismay of the Indian players, Kerr was recalled after the umpires ruled the ball dead, despite Harmanpreet's visible frustration.Animated discussions followed between coach Amol Muzumdar and the fourth umpire, as play remained suspended for a few minutes. Harmanpreet even appeared ready to join the debate, but the fourth umpire eventually instructed them to resume the match, leaving the Indians visibly unconvinced by the explanation.Star India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin also reacted to the development and shared the clip of the event on his X handle.

DUBAI: A completely out of sorts India were trumped by opposition skipper Sophie Devine 's flamboyant batting and tactical astuteness as New Zealand powered to 58-run win in a lopsided Women's T20 World Cup game here on Friday.The 'White Ferns' also put an end to their 10-match losing streak with their biggest win against India in T20Is.On a pitch which was extremely difficult for batting, Devine's power-packed unbeaten 57 off 36 balls took New Zealand to an above-par 160 for 4 in 20 overs.The 35-year-old Kiwi legend then used her slow bowlers to first choke the 'Women in Blue' and then asked her seamers to take pace off deliveries blowing the opposition for a meagre 102 in 19 overs.The difference between two sides was brute power, a mandatory requirement on such surfaces, which Devine and her two openers Suzie Bates and Georgia Plimmer possessed. For India, most of their batters didn't have enough muscle to even clear the 30-yard circle.The game for all practical reasons was won and lost in the Powerplay. While Bates (27 off 24 balls) and young Plimmer (34 off 23 balls) added 55 in the first six overs, India lost their three potential game-changers, Shafali Verma (2), Smriti Mandhana (12) and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (15) in the Powerplay for only 43 runs.The best part about Devine was that the batter in her understood what the skipper required to do. She started with left-arm spinner Eden Carson (2/34 in 4 overs) from one end and Shafali, who is never comfortable if pace is taken off deliveries, closed her bat face and a simple return catch lobbed to the bowler.Mandhana, India's best and most consistent batter over the past few years, also tried to get going and was holed out in the deep while seamer Rosemary Mair (4/19 in 4 overs) bowled one that swung in to hit Harmanpreet on the pads.Such was the slowness that even Lea Tahuhu (3/15 in 4 overs) had Jemimah Rodrigues trying to chip it over mid-on but the stroke lacked power and Richa Ghosh chipped one to mid-off as the Indian challenge fizzled out in a jiffy.Earlier, on a sticky track where stroke-making was difficult, Devine muscled her way with seven boundaries as most Indian bowlers sans Deepti Sharma (0/45 in 4 overs) used the tackiness of the track to good effect for the better part of the innings.Devine, who dropped herself in the batting order, displayed excellent footwork to dismantle the length bowled by Indian bowlers with the standout shot being a bent on knee cover-drive off Shreyanka Patil to complete her fifty.One thing that stuck out like a sore thumb was poor ground fielding from India save Rodrigues, who was brilliant as usual in the deep.Veteran Bates and young Plimmer rode their luck and some shoddy fielding from India to race to 55 at the end of the Powerplay.However once leg-spinner Asha Sobhana (1/22 in 4 overs) started operating just after Powerplay, she immediately put brakes but once Devine started chancing her arms at the death, Indian bowlers were left with little option.",New Zealand beat India by 58 runs to win Women's T20 World Cup game.

Harmanpreet and multiple staff from the coaching team, including head coach Amol Muzumdar , were seen holding discussions over the controversial decision with the match officials.The incident has quickly become a hot topic of debate, with various theories circulating across social media platforms.Following the incident, Indian cricketer Ravichandran Ashwin fueled the discussion on social media, tweeting, ""The over was called before the start of the second run.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer and selector Jatin Paranjape lauded skipper Rohit Sharma for his attacking brand of cricket during the home Test series against Bangladesh, particularly the Kanpur Test .The 52-year-old, who has represented Mumbai at domestic level, said that the second Test of the series will be seen as an ""inflection point"" in Indian team's rich Test cricket history.India recently completed their 2-0 series win against Bangladesh at home. In the Kanpur Test, Team India missed two days of action due to rain and wet outfield after Bangladesh ended the first day at 107/3 in the first innings.When Bangladesh started day four with the same score, the match looked heading towards a draw with two days left and only the first innings being played. But Bangladesh was first skittled out for 233 and then India got some quickfire runs, posting 285/9 and taking two Bangladesh wickets at the end of day four. On the next day, India bundled out Bangladesh for 146 and were leading by 94 runs. They got a target of 95 runs and chased it down easily.Speaking to at the sidelines of the Indian Street Premier League (ISPL) season two Delhi trials, the head of selection in the competition said, ""Since Rohit has become the captain, the intent and DNA of the team have become attack-orientated. The captain himself is leading from the front. Since the 2023 World Cup, we have seen our players go out and attack the bowlers from the start. Rohit has done it himself. We saw that in the T20 World Cup and the Kanpur Test as well. They have decided that their DNA is to attack, their natural instinct has become attacking, and they would not abandon it. I think this is just a trailer of what we will see in Australia (during theBorder-Gavaskar Trophy ) later this year.""""You will look at it (the Kanpur Test) as an inflection point of the Indian team in Test cricket. We were always an attacking side. If you see our batting, right from Rohit to Ashwin, everyone has attack that comes first to them. They will play as per their natural instinct. It depends how the Border Gavaskar Trophy goes. But I think in such situations in the future, they will play such a way, irrespective of the opposition,"" he added.""Yes. You will look at it as an inflection point of the Indian team in Test cricket. We were always an attacking side. If you see our batting, right from Rohit to Ashwin, everyone has an attack which comes first to them. They will play as per their natural instinct. BGT depends how it goes. But I think in such situations in the future, they will play such way, irrespective of the opposition.""Speaking about the Mumbai cricket scene, Paranjape said that Prithvi Shaw is the most talented batter in India.Shaw last played for India in July 2021, has played five Tests, six T20Is, and an ODI for India. Though he had a lot of hype around him because of him being the youngest Test centurion on debut for India and the winning captain 2018 ICC U19 World Cup, Shaw lost his place in the side to the likes of Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Ruturaj Gaikwad due to injuries, poor run of form, technical weaknesses, etc.""I feel Prithvi Shaw is the most talented player in India. He will also be looking forward to the FC season with a lot of expectations, because it is going to be a big one for him. Shaw, Sarfaraz (Khan), Jaiswal and Iyer are Mumbai players whose DNA is to attack. That is how they will continue playing,"" he added.Notably, Paranjape himself played for Mumbai, scoring 3,964 runs in 62 first-class matches at an average of 46.09, with 13 centuries and 15 fifties in 95 innings. His best score was 218.Even though Sarfaraz became the first Mumbai player to smash a double ton in Irani Cup, Paranjape feels that Rohit will continue with the ongoing combination during the upcoming three-match home Test series against New Zealand from October 16 and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia from November 22 onwards.""Rohit's captaincy hallmark is he keeps formation consistent,"" he added.Sarfaraz made his much-anticipated international debut this year during Tests against England after years of fine performances on the domestic circuit. He scored 200 runs in his first three Tests with three fifties.

He levelled with Sri Lankan great Mutthiah Muralitharan to become player with joint-most 'Player of the Series' records, with a total of 11.In the Chennai Test, Ashwin scored a counter-attacking 113 in the first innings and took a six-wicket haul in the final innings to help his team win the game.This was the fourth instance of Ashwin securing a century and five-wicket haul in a Test. Only England legend Ian Botham is ahead of Ashwin in this aspect, having managed to do this feat five times.Also, this was Ashwin's 37th five-wicket haul in Test cricket.

We used to talk a lot about wicket-keeping, we used to talk a lot about batting and yeah, it was often good to talk to Dhoni.""Shifting focus to his relationship with Gautam Gambhir, Akmal referred to the former Indian opener as a close friend, saying, ""We share a good bond and are good friends.

(Pic credit: Mohun Bagan)

KOLKATA: The question came with a certain degree of obviousness and inevitability and Jose Molina couldn't help but play ball during his pre-match news conference at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday.""Are you under more pressure especially after the departure of Carles Cuadrat as East Bengal coach?"" Molina listened to the question intently, sought help from the team’s media manager seated beside him to get the drift behind such a poser and then flashed a smile.""It's not a worry,"" he paused, still smiling. ""The only thing I'm worried about now is tomorrow's match against Mohammedan Sporting. We'll try to play a good match and win. If something has to happen (to me), it will happen,"" the Spanish coach said, trying to put things in perspective.The contrast with which the two teams are preparing to set up this mini-derby has also heightened the sense of the occasion. The onus is clearly on Molina's Mohun Bagan to deliver the goods after the 0-3 humiliation at the hands of Bengaluru FC a week ago.Both Molina and his Australian striker Jason Cummings have called for patience from the fans. But this is something hard to come by in a trophy-driven club. In fact, the way the disgruntled fans reacted to his team's frustrating stalemate against Tajikistan's FC Ravshan in the AFC Champions League Two opener here with 'go-back Molina' chants couldn't have escaped the coach. Another setback and call for Molina's removal will be more pronounced from the stands.Seen from this perspective, Mohammedan Sporting are appearing in the horizon of Molina's Bagan posing an intriguing test to their hosts.By defeating Chennaiyin FC in their own den in the last game, Andrey Chernyshov 's debutants have proved that the so-called elite teams of the new league may take them lightly at their own peril.For Mohammedan Sporting's Russian coach, though, it's all about gaining experience and using them match by match to grow as a unit.""The ISL is a whole new experience for the team. We gained experience from the way we lost to NorthEast United (to a stoppage-time goal) and used to gain a point against FC Goa. Now that we have beaten Chennaiyin, the boys know that we can win also and we'll certainly use this experience in the match against Mohun Bagan,"" said Chernyshov, who guided Mohammedan SC to win the I-League last season and gain promotion to the ISL.Newly recruited French defender Florent Ogier, who landed in the city on the eve of the match, will have to watch it from the stands, but Chernyshov has everyone available for selection.The Russian coach, however, is expecting to face an opponent more hungry and determined to prove a point. The fact that they have lost a match will make them more dangerous coming into this game. There will be pressure on them from the fans and the management. They will be eager to come back stronger. We need to be ready for them,"" Chernyshov said.Aware of the threat from Mohammedan SC's youthful exuberance, Molina also reminded everyone that it won't be an easy match.As Cummings pointed out: ""This season is going to be tougher. We need to be patient. Goals will come, clean sheets will come and wins will come. We need to be at our best every week.""Manvir Singh and Sahal Abdul Samad are injured and doubtful starters but Ashique Kuruniyan may come back to action after a year.",Mohun Bagan take on Mohammedan Sporting in ISL opener on Saturday.

MARGAO: During the pre-match media interaction, FC Goa coach Manolo Marquez spoke fondly of Borja Herrera ’s left foot. The praise came after the hat-trick against East Bengal for Goa’s first win in the Indian Super League ( ISL ) this season.On Friday, Borja’s left foot came to Manolo’s rescue again as the hosts secured a last-gasp equaliser against NorthEast United FC for a 3-3 draw at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda.The end may have been entertaining for the hosts after Borja struck in the fourth minute of added time.They almost secured a win, forcing NorthEast goalkeeper Gurmeet into two good saves deep into stoppage time. But after a cold shower, there would be a reality check as Goa have remained winless in two home games, surrendering the lead in successive games at home. It all started with Nestor Albiach handing NorthEast the lead in the sixth minute. Armando Sadiku then scored in the first half and added time and again just two minutes after the restart to swing the momentum in Goa’s favour.The visitors, though, were not to be left behind as Nestor scored his second and Alaeddine Ajaraie added another one to make it 3-2 with two goals in the 51st and 56th minutes. There was still plenty of time left on the clock. Goa pressed, tried, and only succeeded in the fourth minute of stoppage time with Borja scoring the equaliser with his appreciable left foot.The draw left Goa with just a win from four matches before the international break. “We are not happy despite equalising in the last minute,” Manolo said after the game.","FC Goa draw 3-3 with NorthEast United FC in Indian Super League (ISL) Goa have remained winless in two home games, surrendering the lead in successive games at home.

But they have a chance now to get back to winning ways as they host East Bengal at JRD Tata Sports Complex in Jamshedpur on Saturday.The Kolkata giants have once again made a terrible start to the league having lost all their three opening games and are placed bottom of the table with no point. To make matters worse, their coach Carles Cuadrat resigned earlier this week and Bino George has been brought in as the interim coach.It will naturally be a big challenge for George, who, despite the current situation, sounded quite confident. ""We have a good team and we will stick to our plan. In the last three games we played well but lost because we made small mistakes. So we worked on those mistakes in our training session and I believe the boys will take the responsibility so that we have a good game here,"" said George during the press conference on Friday.Red and Gold captain Cleiton Silva, too, acknowledged the difficulty of the situation but is hopeful of a positive result which he believes will turn everything around.It's not going to be easy though.Playing against Jamshedpur at the Furnace is not an easy task especially when it's packed to the brim which is expected to be the case on Saturday evening. And Khalid Jamil, who had coached East Bengal in the I-League earlier, will be eager to get the better of his previous team and three crucial points.For now his primary focus is on making a good start which hasn't been the case in the last three games. Against all their three opponents — Goa, Mumbai and Odisha — Jamshedpur conceded early and then made a comeback.While they were able to win it on the first two occasions, they fell short against Odisha FC. ""We weren't up to the mark in the last match. But this is a different game and we have to bounce back and get a positive result,"" said Khalid.For that to be realised, a lot will depend on whether the team is able to make the moves down the wings with Imran Khan leading the charge on the right and Seiminlen Doungel or Mohammed Sanan on the left. As far as scoring goals is concerned, the trio of Jordan Murray, Javi Hernandez and Javier Siverio will again be in focus. Most importantly, their defence will have to do a better job along with goalkeeper Albino Gomes if the hosts are to grab some points.But whatever the result, an interesting thing about the fixture is that it will be the first time this season that the two teams facing off will be coached by Indians.

Odisha FC needed back-to-back goals by Kerala Blasters FC early in the first half to stoke the fire within and come out of the initial slumber with a burst of energy to draw level before the break in Bhubaneswar on Thursday. However, despite some quality moves and chances to break the deadlock on both ends in the second half, the scoreline stayed 2-2 as the sides shared spoils in their fourth game of Indian Super League at Kalinga Stadium.Man-in-form and Player-of-the-Match for the second game running, Noah Sadaoui, opened the scoring in the 18th minute before Blasters doubled the lead through Jesus Jimenez in the 21st. Odisha reduced the margin through an own goal by Alexandre Coeff (29’) as Diego Mauricio netted the equaliser for the hosts in the 36th minute.Starting the game with a shot on target by Mauricio in the opening minute, Odisha paid the price of a sloppy defensive display to concede two goals in a span of three minutes. Both the Blasters scorers were given ample space around the box and were allowed to run unchecked before scoring.First, it was Sadaoui who scored his fifth goal against the Kalinga Warriors in the 18th minute to open the scoring following an assist by Jimenez. The Moroccan winger continued his rich form this season to score with a right-footed shot from left of the box to right corner.Three minutes later, both combined again to double the lead but this time the roles were reversed as Sadaoui turned provider for the Spanish centre forward, whose right-footed shot from the right went to the top right corner. Sadaoui, with his electrifying presence on the wings, cut into the area from the left before passing it to Jimenez across the box.During the final move, the entire Odisha defence was standing in a line while centre-back Mourtada Fall stood still barely a few feet away from the scorer, unable to pose any challenge for Jimenez, whose shot was good enough to give Amrinder Singh absolutely no chance.The early setbacks made Odisha regroup and come back stronger thereafter. As their midfield play improved, Odisha got hold of the possession and Blasters goalkeeper Sachin Suresh’s sloppy work, again, helped them to reduce the lead with an own goal just before the drinks break.Ahmed Jahouh’s quick and short corner from left was sent back to him by Isak Ralte (Vanlalruatfela), and the Moroccan playmaker’s shot from left was saved by Suresh in front of the goalline with a volleyball-like technique. As Suresh failed to collect the ball it ricocheted off his teammate Alexandre Coeff’s legs from close range before crossing the goal-line despite the French midfielder’s attempt for a goal-line save.Six minutes after the drinks break, Mauricio played a 1-2 with Jerry Mawihmingthanga inside the box after receiving a through from Jahouh and scored from centre of box with a right-footed shot through the legs of Blasters centre-back Pritam Kotal and Suresh.With the draw Blasters, with five points, moved up a spot to fifth on the table while Odisha rose a rung above Mohun Bagan SG to ninth with four points.",Noah Sadaoui opened the scoring in the 18th minute before Blasters doubled the lead through Jesus Jimenez in the 21st.

TIEBREAK UPSET

BEIJING: Carlos Alcaraz rallied from a set down and held his nerve in a deciding tiebreak to beat defending champion Jannik Sinner 6-7(6) 6-4 7-6(3) in the China Open final on Wednesday and win his fourth title of the season.French Open and Wimbledon champion Alcaraz, who won both of his previous meetings with Sinner this year, recovered from a slow start to wrap up victory in three hours, 21 minutes and improve his head-to-head record with the Italian to 6-4.While the stage might not have been as grand as it was in some of their recent encounters, Sinner and Alcaraz pushed each other to the limit in the latest chapter of the burgeoning rivalry that has taken the ATP Tour by storm.""He could have won in two, I could have won in two, it was a really close match. Jannik once again showed that he's the best player in the world, with the level that he's playing,"" Alcaraz, 21, said.""It is unbelievable, it's a really high quality of tennis , physically, mentally, he's a beast.""I had my chances in the first set but didn't make it, but in general I'm proud of myself. The way that I dealt with the match, the way that I managed everything. For me, it was a really good match.""After both players defended break points in a cagey start, Alcaraz seized the early break for a 3-1 lead when Sinner's backhand went wide, before consolidating the advantage in the next as his Italian opponent netted a shot.World number one Sinner, whose last win over Alcaraz came in the semi-finals of this tournament last year, gradually found his range to level at 5-5 and save two set points in the tiebreak to clinch the first set.Alcaraz was on the ropes early in the second set and Sinner pushed him hard in a 15-minute game, but the second seed successfully held serve for 4-4.Sinner's failure to break in the lengthy game appeared to take the wind out of his sails, as Alcaraz sped through the next two games to level the match at a set apiece.The Spaniard cranked up the intensity on his forehand and broke for a 2-1 lead in the third set, but with victory seemingly in sight, he suffered a lapse in concentration and allowed Sinner to level at 4-4.In the deciding tiebreak, Sinner snatched control to take a 3-0 lead, but some excellent work at the net helped Alcaraz edge a couple of rallies and go ahead 4-3, before finally clinching the title with an emphatic cross-court forehand winner.The tiebreak defeat was uncharacteristic for Sinner, who had won 18 out of his past 19 tiebreaks.Asked if Sinner's record had caused him any doubt, Alcaraz said: ""I never lost hope, but honestly, I know that stat. Every time that Jannik plays (a tiebreak), it goes to his side.""I'm not going to lie, at 3-0 down and with two mini breaks for him, I thought, 'Okay, I have to give everything that I have just to try to give myself the opportunity to be close'.""I played great points just to make it 3-3 and after that, I just thought 'go for it'. If I lost it, at least I went for it.""The result denied Australian Open and U.S. Open champion Sinner becoming the first man to retain the crown at the China National Tennis Centre since Novak Djokovic won four straight titles between 2012-15.",Carlos Alcaraz beats Jannik Sinner 6-7(6) 6-4 7-6(3) in the China Open final.

Shades of Kylian Mbappe

BEIJING: Jannik Sinner ignored the bubbling controversy over his steroid case and a roaring home crowd to set up a China Open final against Carlos Alcaraz on Tuesday.The world number one and defending champion defeated the 96th-ranked Chinese wildcard Bu Yunchaokete 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) to avoid a major upset.The Italian faces Spanish second seed Alcaraz, who was in fine form in a 7-5, 6-3 victory over Russian third seed Daniil Medvedev in the other semi-final.In front of a packed house on China's national day, US Open champion Sinner was facing a player he had never met before and who was competing in the biggest match of his life.China's 22-year-old Bu was also in the form of his life, having similarly reached the semi-finals last week in Hangzhou.Bu had Sinner under pressure on the Italian's serve early in the first set, but Sinner staved off the threat and the storm gradually blew itself out as the set wore on.They went to the tie break in the second set, with Sinner serving an ace to convert his third match point after just over two hours.Nobody has won more matches on tour this season than Sinner, 23, who failed two doping tests in March but was cleared of wrongdoing and allowed to keep playing.Tennis authorities accepted Sinner's explanation that trace amounts of a banned steroid unintentionally entered his system from a physiotherapist who used a spray containing it to treat a cut, then provided massage and sports therapy.The World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) reignited the case on Saturday, saying it had appealed the decision and is seeking a ban of up to two years.Sinner has admitted to having sleepless nights over the issue.Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz reached his first final in the Chinese capital and is in ominous form, yet to drop a set.""I think I played really well. Obviously if I want to beat Daniil, I have to play really good tennis, high-quality tennis,"" said Alcaraz, who is chasing a 16th ATP Tour title -- which would equal Sinner.""I felt great on the court once again, so I'm really happy about it. I think I couldn't ask for a better semi-final.""The final is on Wednesday.In the women's draw, 595th-ranked home hope Zhang Shuai -- one of the storylines of the tournament -- rolled into the quarter-finals to make more history.Her 6-4, 6-2 victory over Magdalena Frech was her fourth win in Beijing and all in straight sets -- having come into the event after losing 24 singles matches in a row.The barren run lasting more than 600 days was the second-longest on the WTA Tour in the Open Era, which began in 1968.The 35-year-old Zhang, a former two-time Grand Slam quarter-finalist who has been plagued by injury, said she had come close to quitting singles tennis before coming to Beijing.""I had no idea how to win and I didn't want to lose another, especially with all the Chinese fans,"" she said.""Walking back to the locker room, I didn't know if I should continue or not before this tournament.""The former top-25 player will face Spain's 19th-ranked Paula Badosa in the last eight.Zhang is the lowest-ranked player to reach this stage of the China Open and struck a defiant pose -- a tribute to Kylian Mbappe -- after beating 31st-ranked Frech.Former world number two Badosa dumped out US Open finalist Jessica Pegula 6-4, 6-0 to make the second-seeded American the biggest casualty so far.","Jannik Sinner beats 96th-ranked Chinese wildcard Bu Yunchaokete 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) Italian faces Spanish second seed Carlos Alcaraz in the other semi-final.
