'A particularly special feeling': Andy Flower hails Virat Kohli, RCB after historic title win

Poll Do you think the break during IPL 2025 was beneficial for RCB? Yes, it helped players recover No, it disrupted the momentum Unsure





Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) head coach Andy Flower has admitted that ‘ Operation Sindoor ’ — the emergency situation that led to the one-week suspension of IPL 2025 on May 9 — turned out to be a blessing in disguise for the eventual champions.RCB captain Rajat Patidar recovered from a finger injury during the break, while the team’s leading wicket-taker Josh Hazlewood returned from a shoulder injury after undergoing rehab and training in Australia.""Even this evening while we were celebrating, a couple of guys mentioned to me that the break gave Hazlewood time to recover, and crucially, it gave Rajat time to recover with his hand,"" Flower told reporters after RCB lifted their maiden IPL trophy.""But we still missed Tim David and Devdutt Padikkal from our initial squad. They were huge parts of our campaign.""""For those who believe in fate, I’m sure they’ll find a story to tell. There were obviously bigger things at play than RCB winning the trophy at that time — and we all recognised that. But yes, it did give us a bit of breathing space. We were a little slow off the blocks before that,"" he added.Hazlewood, who finished as RCB’s top wicket-taker this season, bagged 22 wickets in just 12 games.“Absolutely, you won’t get a better experience than this,” Hazlewood told broadcasters when asked if returning mid-season was the right decision.Patidar, who missed a couple of games due to injury, ended the season with 312 runs in 15 matches at a healthy strike rate of 143.77.Head coach Flower was full of praise for Rajat — not just for his batting, but for his leadership in his debut season as captain.""I think one of the most impressive things about what Rajat has done this year is that, as an inexperienced captain, he hasn’t let it affect him. I don’t think it has impacted his batting at all,"" said Flower.""I’ve watched him closely as a character, and he is still the same lovely, gentle, polite Rajat Patidar that we knew last year. He hasn’t changed at all in that regard.""""Captaining RCB is a really tricky job. When I think back to how poorly I captained at his age, I’ve got tremendous respect for how he’s carried himself under such scrutiny — especially while leading some big players.""""You can't underestimate the calmness he showed in leading a star-studded franchise. He made good decisions under immense pressure, and that deserves a lot of respect,"" he added.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) head coach Andy Flower has admitted that ‘ Operation Sindoor ’ — the emergency situation that led to the one-week suspension of IPL 2025 on May 9 — turned out to be a blessing in disguise for the eventual champions.

Allen Iverson shares posts dedicated to son Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson and wife Tawanna Turner





Former NBA legend, Allen Iverson shares a heartwarming post for his son, Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson on his Instagram. The post contains photos from Isaiah’s childhood, teenage years, and graduation ceremony. Allen went on to praise him saying that he’s the true definition of what a son should be, and the way he always looks out for family is what makes him better than others. He goes on to say how proud of a father he is. However, this post came days after Allen dedicated an entire post for ex-wife, Tawanna Turner.Allen Iverson talks profoundly about his son Isaiah on his recent Instagram post. He talks about Isaiah’s qualities and how he is a son that every father will be proud of.“The true definition of a son,” says Allen as he starts the post, showing how proud he is of Isaiah.However, this post comes days after Allen dedicated an entire post to ex-wife Tawanna Turner, with whom he shares five children, Allen Iverson II, Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson, Dream Alijha, Tiaura, and Messiah Lauren. The post had a montage of the couple’s photos from prom, early court days, and as such. Allen captioned the photo as “HER” followed by heart and crossed fingers emoticons.Allen and Tawanna tied the knot in 2001, and had a happy marriage for quite some years. However, trouble entered their married life in the form of lavish expenditures, Iverson’s questionable parenting skills, and alcohol habits. In 2013, when Iverson retired from the world of NBA, his married life also came to an end. The couple called it quits in 2013 and agreed to co-parenting their kids.However, it seems Allen’s life turned upside down soon after his lady luck left. After retirement, Allen spent all of his fortune on expensive cars, and lavish lifestyle. Due to this, he became bankrupt by 2015. However, things have started taking turn for Iverson as he recently signed a deal with Reebok and agreed to be the Vice President of basketball division for the brand. He had earlier made a lifetime deal with Reebok back in 2001, which brought him $800,000 per year. The contract also had a clause that stated Iverson will get an additional $32 million at the age of 55. Will the new role help Iverson turn the course of events or will he fall back into old habits?

Is Travis Kelce done with football? Hollywood move sparks rumors of secret retirement plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/is-travis-kelce-done-with-football-hollywood-move-sparks-rumors-of-secret-retirement-plan/articleshow/121608617.cms,"Travis Kelce is strategically positioning himself for a post-NFL career in Hollywood (Getty Images)

From Super Bowl Sundays to silver screen stardom: Travis Kelce prepares for life after football

Podcasting power moves and a strategic agency shift signal serious career planning

Despite rising fame, Travis Kelce insists he’s not done with football — yet





Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce appears to be seriously paving the way for a post-football career, and it’s not just through endorsements or podcasting — he’s heading straight for Hollywood. With retirement discussions intensifying, Kelce is aligning his off-field presence with opportunities that suggest he’s gearing up for a full pivot into entertainment.Travis Kelce’s first major acting role will come in the highly anticipated Happy Gilmore 2, starring Adam Sandler. Sandler himself had high praise for the tight end: “We have a nice something for Travis... What a big handsome guy. Funny and cool as hell. He’s a stud, and he’s so funny.” This isn’t Kelce’s first brush with TV — he previously appeared in FX’s horror series Grotesquerie and the 2020 sci-fi comedy Moonbase 8. But this upcoming film marks his cinematic debut, and one that could launch him into a new stratosphere of stardom.Kelce and his brother Jason recently inked a massive $100 million deal with Amazon for their New Heights podcast, which has become a cultural phenomenon.The podcast not only expanded their fanbase but also cemented the Kelce brothers as media personalities beyond football. Behind the scenes, Kelce’s management team, A&A Management, was acquired by entertainment powerhouse 3 Arts Entertainment — a move that aligns with long-term plans to transition smoothly into film and TV.The Eanes brothers, who represent Kelce, have drawn comparisons between him and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, noting Kelce’s rare mix of charisma, athleticism, and on-screen potential. It’s a bold comparison, but not an unreasonable one. The NFL star’s personality, already beloved by fans, seems tailor-made for the screen.Though Kelce remains under contract with the Chiefs through 2027, he has openly acknowledged that the end of his NFL career is approaching. After the team fell short of a Super Bowl three-peat, many speculated that Kelce might hang up his cleats.

Steelers quarterback dilemma deepens as ESPN panel splits over Kirk Cousins vs. Aaron Rodgers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/steelers-quarterback-dilemma-deepens-as-espn-panel-splits-over-kirk-cousins-vs-aaron-rodgers/articleshow/121598221.cms,"Pittsburgh Steelers' quarterback situation remains uncertain (Getty Images)

Kirk Cousins presents a longer-term, yet expensive, solution for Pittsburgh

Aaron Rodgers could be a short-term fix with less financial risk





As the Pittsburgh Steelers continue to face uncertainty under center, a new twist in the quarterback carousel has analysts and fans buzzing. With Russell Wilson and Justin Fields no longer seen as long-term options, attention is now zeroing in on two aging but high-profile quarterbacks: Kirk Cousins and Aaron Rodgers.On ESPN’s Get Up, analysts Bart Scott, Mike Tannenbaum, and Peter Schrager debated who would be the better fit for the Steelers—and their perspectives couldn’t be more divided.Cousins, who inked a massive $180 million deal with the Falcons last offseason, has become a financial headache for Atlanta after being benched midseason. He’s missed OTAs, and his hefty contract may be too much for the Falcons to carry.Bart Scott believes Cousins may provide stability, saying, “Kirk Cousins offers you multiple years of a solution, but with his injury history and also his salary demands, what kind of deal does that mean going forward?” Scott also pointed to Pittsburgh’s lingering QB void after Kenny Pickett didn’t pan out: “The reason why there’s an opening there is Kenny Pickett was a bust… I believe so.”Mike Tannenbaum, former Jets GM, agreed—especially if Pittsburgh can negotiate down Cousins’ salary: “I’d much rather have Kirk Cousins than Aaron Rodgers.”Rodgers, meanwhile, is still undecided about playing in 2025 after missing most of last season with an Achilles injury. Scott acknowledged Rodgers’ potential value, saying, “I don’t think he’s a better play. I think Aaron Rodgers had a sneaky solid season coming back from the Achilles.”But he argued that Cousins offers more continuity for the team.Peter Schrager pushed back, calling a Cousins trade a “panic move”: “They could have traded for Kirk Cousins in March… To me, this seems like a desperate move.”Scott flipped the desperation narrative, saying it’s Atlanta that needs to act: “Desperate for who? Because last I checked the Atlanta Falcons were $13 million over the salary cap.”Also Read: Aaron Rodgers leaves Steelers hanging as potential signing remains shrouded in silence and speculation In the end, Pittsburgh's quarterback drama remains unresolved as the franchise waits for Rodgers to decide—and possibly eyes Cousins as a strategic backup plan. Either way, it’s clear the Steelers’ 2025 season hinges on solving this puzzle.","The Pittsburgh Steelers continue to face uncertainty under center.

Zaya Wade and Dwyane Wade turn a birthday into a moment of support





Zaya and Dwyane Wade speak from the heart about their bond





On the surface, it looked like a glamorous 18th birthday bash, bright lights, bold fashion, and a buzzing Hollywood venue. But behind the sparkle, Zaya Wade’s big night held a powerful secret. With just a $20 entry ticket, guests weren’t only stepping into a party, they were stepping into a movement. Just days before Pride Month, Zaya, alongside her father Dwyane Wade, revealed something far bigger than a celebration. This wasn’t just a birthday. It was a mission disguised in glitter and grace.The event was called The Venus Ascension Ball. It happened just two days before Pride Month started. The location was NeueHouse in Hollywood, California. Zaya planned the night with a clear goal. Tickets cost $20, and every dollar went to Translatable, a platform she created in 2023 with her dad, Dwyane Wade.Translatable is a digital space that supports LGBTQ+ youth. It offers tools, education, and personal stories. It helps young people feel seen and gives families guidance to support them.Many people came to the ball. Dwyane Wade was there. So was his wife, actress Gabrielle Union , and their daughter, Kaavia Wade.The family showed love and support the whole night.Big brands also helped out. MAC Cosmetics gave $100,000 to the Trans Wellness Center in Zaya’s honor. Other sponsors included H&M, the Utah Jazz, and Folx Health.The Trans Wellness Center, run by Marian Marroquin, was the nonprofit partner. It helps trans people in Los Angeles with health care, housing, and education.The party wasn’t just about raising money. It was a true ball. Guests dressed up. There were runway contests with $15,000 in cash prizes. Zaya wore a strapless beaded gown, then changed into a short lace dress. Her cake showed The Birth of Venus, a painting about beauty and new life.Zaya later said, “It was indescribable. Imagine an explosion of love and light wrapped up into one magical night.”Zaya’s family has supported her from the start. She came out as transgender in 2020, at just 12 years old. At the time, the Wades were living in Florida. But due to new laws against LGBTQ+ rights, they moved to California. Dwyane Wade said, “The community wasn’t here for Zaya, so the community wasn’t here for us.”In May 2024, Dwyane Wade shared a podcast where Zaya joined him as a guest. They talked about their close bond. Dwyane said people don’t see how much they work together.He also shared that they received the Elevate Prize Catalyst Award. This award supports their mission to helpLGBTQ+ youth. Dwyane explained that Translatable gives these young people a safe online place to connect. It also helps families learn how to support them.Zaya’s birthday looked like a party.

Corey Perry shuts down retirement rumors as Stanley Cup Final looms

Veteran forward wants more as he eyes free agency after playoff run





Corey Perry, one of the NHL’s most seasoned veterans, isn’t hanging up his skates just yet. As the Edmonton Oilers gear up for the Stanley Cup Final, the 40-year-old winger has silenced retirement rumors with a bold announcement. Despite nearing free agency, Perry confirmed he plans to return for a 21st season, proving he still has plenty left to give.As the Edmonton Oilers gear up for their first Stanley Cup Final appearance since 1990, veteran forward Corey Perry is already thinking ahead to what’s next—and no, it’s not retirement.Now 40 years old and in his 20th NHL season, Perry continues to defy expectations. He’s proven this postseason that he still brings tremendous value to a contending team. Despite being one of the league's oldest active players, Perry confirmed to reporters that he has “no intention of retiring just yet,” according to Chris Johnston of The Athletic. That clears up any retirement speculation—and adds intrigue to his pending free agency.Perry’s one-year deal with Edmonton will expire at the end of the 2024–25 season, setting him up to enter the unrestricted free agent market once again.While it’s unclear if the Oilers will offer a new deal, there’s no question Perry has shown he still has gas left in the tank.During the regular season, Perry skated in 81 games, notching 30 points—including 11 goals—while logging nearly 12 minutes of ice time per game. But it’s his playoff production that’s turned heads: seven goals and 10 points in 16 postseason contests, serving as a clutch performer in the team’s deep run.Though he’s no longer the nearly point-per-game player he once was during his peak with the Anaheim Ducks, Perry’s leadership and timely scoring are the kind of assets every playoff contender craves.Perry isn’t rushing his next move just yet. He remains focused on helping Edmonton capture its first Stanley Cup since 1990—a milestone that would give him his second career title, the first coming with Anaheim in 2007.Also Read: Why did Connor Bedard reject Team Canada’s World Championship invite — and what’s really behind his surprising decision?

Poll Do you think Vanessa Bryant handled the pregnancy rumors well? Yes, very cleverly No, she should have addressed them directly





After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.Also Read: Is Vanessa Bryant pregnant with her 5th child? The Internet speculates about her relationship with rumoured BF In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”Vanessa, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip.","Vanessa Bryant addressed her pregnancy rumors in a wild Instagram story.

The Indiana Pacers face a major threat heading into Game 1 of the NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder

2001 Lakers (-2000): With Shaq and Kobe in their prime, L.A. rolled through the playoffs 15-1, dominating the Sixers and claiming the title with ease.



2018 Warriors (-1075): Kevin Durant and company dismantled the Cavaliers in a clean 4-0 sweep.

1996 Bulls (-950): Michael Jordan’s record-setting 72-win team beat the Sonics in six games, cementing their dynasty.



2000 Lakers (-800): Shaq averaged a staggering 38 points per game as they defeated—ironically—the Indiana Pacers in six games.



2004 Lakers (-700): Despite a superteam lineup, they were shocked by the Pistons in a stunning 4-1 upset.

1986 Celtics (-700): Bird, McHale, and Parish outmatched the Rockets for a dominant win.







As the Indiana Pacers prepare for their first NBA Finals appearance in nearly a quarter-century, one unexpected challenge has emerged before even stepping onto the hardwood: the favorite and the odds. Additionally, Tyrese Haliburton and his squad, fresh off a playoff run full of upsets, find themselves battling delays caused by severe thunderstorms and tornado warnings that disrupted their travel to Game 1. In a series already stacked against them, Mother Nature has joined the opposition.Led by MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the Oklahoma City Thunder finished the season with a 68-14 record, one of the best in league history, and entered the NBA Finals as colossal -700 favorites, according to Yahoo Sports.The numbers place them among the most heavily favored teams in Finals history. To put things in perspective, consider these iconic comparisons—That last outlier, the 2004 Lakers, serves as a cautionary tale. Favorites don’t always finish the job, and this underdog Pacers team, led by Haliburton, is built to break narratives as they have so far in the playoffs.But the odds aren’t the only thunderous hurdle looming over the Pacers.According to Fieldhouse Files reporter Scott Agness, severe weather caused a major delay in Indiana’s flight to Oklahoma City.“According to flight data, the plane landed at Will Rogers International Airport at 7:58 p.m. ET — five hours after takeoff, about twice as long as the expected flight time,” Agness reported.While the Pacers are expected to hold practices before each Finals game, the extended travel time and turbulent arrival are far from ideal.

Controversy around the Imane Khelif’s gold medal at Paris Olympic



IOC calls findings misinformation



Response of World Boxing

Fairness and safety concerns from athletes and federations



Ongoing debate on gender and sport eligibility





A leaked medical report from the 2023 World Championships has revealed that Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelif is biologically male, according to chromosome analysis. The report, made public just days after World Boxing ordered Khelif to undergo sex testing for eligibility in future female competitions, shows she has a male XY karyotype. This revelation challenges the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) earlier dismissal of such tests and has intensified debate over fairness and safety in women’s boxing. The findings come amid ongoing controversy surrounding Khelif’s participation in women’s events, sparking calls for stricter verification procedures in sport.The report, published on the 3 Wire Sports website, states that Khelif’s chromosome analysis is “abnormal” and confirms a male karyotype. It was conducted by Dr Lal PathLabs in New Delhi, a lab accredited by the American College of Pathologists and certified by the International Organisation for Standardisation. This directly challenges the IOC’s spokesperson Mark Adams, who had described such test results as “ad hoc” and “not legitimate” during a press conference at the Paris Olympics.The controversy surrounding Imane Khelif’s Olympic gold medal run began as early as her first bout in Paris, where she faced Italy’s Angela Carini.Carini, an experienced and respected boxer, was visibly shaken during the match. Overwhelmed by Khelif’s strength and intensity, she appeared distressed and left the ring in tears after the fight, later telling media she had feared for her safety. The unease only deepened in the final bout, where Khelif defeated Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting in a dominant display that many felt was physically one-sided. The power difference between the fighters drew sharp criticism, with commentators and athletes calling it “uncomfortable to watch” and likening it to watching a man beat a woman in the ring. The moment became one of the most controversial of the Paris Games, fuelling an international debate over fairness and inclusion in women’s sport.IOC president Thomas Bach dismissed the report as part of a Russian-led misinformation campaign, citing ethical and financial issues within the International Boxing Association (IBA), which conducted the tests. Despite these claims, the legitimacy of the Indian lab’s certification has increased pressure on the IOC to clarify its position and respond to questions about Khelif’s eligibility.Following the leak, World Boxing has declared that Khelif must pass mandatory chromosome testing before competing in any future female events. The 26-year-old Olympic champion, who was allowed to compete in Paris due to her female passport status, has so far not provided evidence to confirm female chromosomes. World Boxing now requires all athletes over 18 in its competitions to undergo PCR genetic testing to verify their sex, a measure introduced in response to this controversy.The case has raised serious safety and fairness concerns within the boxing community. Opponents like Italy’s Angela Carini and Mexico’s Brianda Tamara have spoken out about the physical challenges they faced competing against Khelif. Latin American federations have been particularly vocal, urging that women’s competitions be restricted to athletes assigned female at birth, in order to protect fairness and athlete safety.The Khelif controversy highlights the complex and sensitive issues surrounding transgender and intersex athletes in competitive sport. It underscores the need for clear, consistent policies that balance inclusivity with fairness and safety. As governing bodies reassess their rules, the case remains a key example of the challenges faced in maintaining the integrity of women’s sports.The ongoing debate around Imane Khelif’s case brings to light just how complex and emotionally charged the conversation about gender and eligibility in sport has become. At the heart of it are real athletes — women who train for years and step into the ring expecting fairness. Many feel blindsided and unheard when competing against opponents whose physical attributes raise legitimate concerns about safety and equality. This isn’t about exclusion, but about protecting hard-won opportunities for women in sport. Khelif’s story reminds us that governing bodies must act transparently, thoughtfully, and with empathy for all athletes involved.","Leaked medical report from 2023 World Championships reveals Imane Khelif is biologically male, according to chromosome analysis.

However, in a surprising twist during the endgame, the Norwegian grandmaster made a rare error — one that D Gukesh was quick to seize upon.Staying focused under pressure, the 19-year-old Indian grandmaster capitalized on the opportunity, shifting the momentum and steering the match to a stunning win. It was Gukesh’s first classical win over Carlsen, making it a milestone moment in his already impressive career.With this win, Gukesh now holds 8.5 points in the Norway Chess 2025 standings, moving into third place. He is currently just one point behind co-leaders Magnus Carlsen and American grandmaster Fabiano Caruana, both of whom have 9.5 points.The tournament is still underway, and all eyes are now on Gukesh as he continues to chase the top spot.",D Gukesh defeated world champion Magnus Carlsen in the sixth round of the Norway Chess 2025 tournament. The 19-year-old Indian grandmaster is the youngest World Chess Champion in 2024.

IPL 2025 Final, RCB vs Punjab Kings: The wait will finally end in Ahmedabad

Check some reactions here:





NEW DELHI: The pressure ahead of the IPL 2025 final between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Punjab Kings was palpable — not just on the players, but also on fans, broadcasters, and everyone involved. And it seems even former India cricketer Ravi Shastri wasn’t immune to the nerves.Arriving as the presenter for the toss at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Tuesday, the ex-Team India coach and veteran commentator made a major blunder during the live broadcast.After Punjab Kings skipper Shreyas Iyer won the toss and elected to bowl first, Shastri conducted the post-toss interviews with both captains. But once Shreyas and RCB captain Rajat Patidar walked away, Shastri made a glaring error on air — he announced that Iyer had chosen to bat, even acting it out with a classic front-foot defensive stroke gesture.The goof-up didn’t go unnoticed. Within minutes, fans lit up social media, triggering a meme fest poking fun at Shastri’s comical mix-up on live television.Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer won the toss and elected to bowl first against Royal Challengers Bengaluru.With both teams hoping to win their maiden title in the league, the team managements decided to go in with the tried and trusted and remain unchanged for the final.RCB have decided to go ahead without Tim David, who had missed their last two matches with an injury.On the biggest occasion for the franchise, PBKS skipper Shreyas Iyer said his players are in a good mindset and will play it like a final.""I want to give positive signs to my mind and body. I feel it's an amazing day, here at the moment. Crowd here is electrifying, just want to cherish it. Boys in a brilliant mindset,"" he said at the toss.Asked what they discussed in the pre-match meeting, Iyer said, ""All we talked about in the meeting was about how keeping calm gives the best results. That's been the message throughout. We hope to embrace the occasion. I'm absolutely fine. We're gonna play it like a final. Have envisioned lifting the trophy.""RCB skipper Rajat Patidar said they would have also liked to bowl first on this wicket.""We also wanted to bowl. Surface looks hard. Will try to put on a good total. Till now we've played well, it's just another game for us. We'll give it our best.""It's a big stage but it's just another away game for us. Everyone's played well till now, will try to do the same now. Same team. Looks a good pitch, flat, mix of red and black soil. Should be good to bat,"" said Patidar.The match will be played on pitch number six which is a 25% black soil and 75% red soil surface.

IPL 2025 Final | Rishi Sunak Interview: 'I am a big Virat Kohli fan... RCB is my team'





NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s (RCB) star batter Virat Kohli leapt in celebration and hugged Romario Shepherd after the pacer dismissed Punjab Kings (PBKS) skipper Shreyas Iyer for just 1. Iyer was caught behind by Jitesh Sharma off a short-of-a-length delivery outside off. Though the umpire didn’t raise his finger, Iyer walked immediately, acknowledging the faint outside edge. Jitesh was ready to review, but the PBKS captain’s honesty spared the referral.Earlier, RCB huffed and puffed their way to 190 for 9 in the IPL 2025 final at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Tuesday. On a batting-friendly surface, the fourth-time finalists once again faltered on the big stage, unable to apply significant scoreboard pressure.While Kohli has long anchored innings with calculated composure, his approach backfired this time. He managed 43 off 35 balls, striking just three fours — two of which came after the ninth over — at a strike rate of 122.85, looking far too conservative in the high-stakes final.RCB were relatively brisk in the powerplay, reaching 55/1, but their momentum stalled thereafter. Between overs 6 and 11, they mustered only 42 runs, with the batters largely rotating strike rather than pushing for big overs.Phil Salt gave RCB a fiery start, smashing a six and a four in the first over. However, in the next, he mistimed a shot off Kyle Jamieson, offering a skier that was safely pouched by Shreyas Iyer after covering over 10 paces back at mid-on.Salt’s dismissal proved to be a turning point, as RCB lost momentum. Mayank Agarwal (24), Rajat Patidar (26), and Liam Livingstone (25) all got starts but couldn’t convert them into impactful scores.Jamieson (3/48) was instrumental, mixing his lengths cleverly. After removing Salt, he returned in the 11th over to trap Patidar LBW with a superb slower yorker. His figures took a slight beating in the 17th over when Jitesh Sharma (24 off 10 balls) and Livingstone launched a counter-attack, collecting 23 runs off the over with three sixes between them. But Jamieson had the final say, trapping Livingstone leg-before with a full toss.Arshdeep Singh, who had an expensive start — conceding 37 in his first three overs — produced a brilliant final over. He dismissed Krunal Pandya (4), Bhuvneshwar Kumar (1), and Romario Shepherd (17 off 9), who threatened to lift RCB past 200 with a six and a four late in the innings.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) reach 190 for 9 in IPL 2025 final.

Poll Was Krunal Pandya the key reason for RCB’s IPL 2025 title win? Yes, his bowling changed the game No, others contributed more





NEW DELHI: Krunal Pandya delivered a Player of the Match performance to guide Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) to their maiden Indian Premier League (IPL) title at the Narendra Modi Stadium on Tuesday.Picked up by RCB for Rs 5.75 crore in the IPL 2025 mega auction, Krunal brought out his full arsenal, refusing to let Punjab Kings gain control during their chase.His spell of 2 for 17, which included the crucial wickets of Prabhsimran Singh and Josh Inglis, proved to be a game-changer and played a key role in RCB’s six-run victory.Krunal later revealed that he had set his intentions clearly with the franchise during his very first conversation — he was there to win trophies — and he made good on that promise with a match-defining performance.“When we batted, we realised the slower you bowl, the better it is. In this format, you need guts to do it. I just backed myself and thought I'd vary my pace and keep it on the slower side more often. My biggest strength has been to learn what the situation requires. I knew I had to be brave to get wickets tonight. Thought I'd do that by bowling slow. If you'd have bowled quick, it'd have been a good wicket. But if you mixed it up, it was tougher.Pitch actually got easier in the second innings,” said Krunal while collecting the POTM trophy.“Have enjoyed my time with RCB so far. I told them on day one that I like to win trophies. I told Hardik too that the Pandya household will have nine trophies in 11 years,” he added.Krunal now has four IPL titles to his name — three with Mumbai Indians — and Tuesday's performance marked the second time he has won the Player of the Match award in an IPL final.The first came in 2017, when he scored 47 off 38 balls to help Mumbai Indians defeat the now-defunct Rising Pune Supergiant.",Krunal Pandya was named Player of the Match in Royal Challengers Bengaluru's IPL 2025 title win over Punjab Kings.

New York Knicks opt for new leadership after Thibodeau 's five-season tenure





The New York Knicks have announced that they are letting go of head coach Tom Thibodeau just days after the team had one of its best seasons in 25 years. He got the Knicks to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time in two decades and earned an impressive 51–31 record, yet he was let go abruptly. The signing proves that the organization is strongly committed to winning its first NBA championship since 1973.It is obvious that Tom Thibodeau is having a strong impact on the New York Knicks. Since he became a part of the team in 2020, he has turned a failing franchise into an important playoff contender. With his leadership, the Knicks finished the regular season with a 226–174 (.565) record and reached the playoffs in all but one of the five seasons, finally getting to the Eastern Conference Finals in the 2024–25 season.This season will remain in our memories for a very long time. The team finished the season with a 51–31 record which was their best record since 2012–2013 and was ranked third in the Eastern Conference. They won their first two matches in the playoffs: they eliminated the Detroit Pistons in six games and then beat the defending champion Boston Celtics in another six games to get to the Eastern Conference Finals. Sadly, the Pacers denied the Knicks their hopes for a championship and New York fell in six games.Despite these achievements, the Knicks' front office decided a change was necessary. Team president Leon Rose stated, ""Our organization is singularly focused on winning a championship for our fans. This pursuit led us to the difficult decision to inform Tom Thibodeau that we've decided to move in another direction"" . The decision has been met with surprise, especially given the team's recent success and Thibodeau's role in revitalizing the franchise.Players have expressed their support for Thibodeau. Star point guard Jalen Brunson, who had a standout season and was named the NBA Clutch Player of the Year, defended his coach, stating, ""Is that a real question right now? You just asked me if I believe that he's the right guy? Yes. Come on"" . Teammate Josh Hart also shared his appreciation for Thibodeau on social media, highlighting the strong bond between the coach and his players.Also Read: Tony Buzbee Says No to Moriah Mills’ Zion Williamson Case Amid NBA Star’s Ongoing Civil Lawsuit Tom Thibodeau's firing signals the close of an important era for the New York Knicks.

'Daring, Dynamic, Different': Ponting hails PBKS young guns despite final loss





At the pre-match press conference on Monday and again at the toss, Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) captain Rajat Patidar maintained that his team would treat this final like any other match. And true to their skipper’s word, they played it just like that.In a high-pressure game, RCB stuck to their strengths and defeated Punjab Kings (PBKS) by six runs. The win ended RCB’s — and Virat Kohli ’s — 18-year wait for the elusive silverware. Kohli, who has been with the franchise since its inception, finally lifted the IPL trophy.Before Tuesday, RCB had lost three IPL finals. A common theme in those defeats was their reliance on two or three individual performances. This time, however, they built a team — instead of just banking on their superstar.That superstar, of course, was Virat Kohli.Kohli wasn’t at his best in the final. But the rest of the RCB batters stepped up to carry the load.Phil Salt began the assault with a 9-ball 17, Mayank Agarwal maintained the tempo with a brisk 18-ball 24, followed by a composed knock from captain Rajat Patidar (26 off 16 balls).The much-needed impetus came from Jitesh Sharma (25 off 10 balls), whose two sixes off Kyle Jamieson in the 17th over turned the tide in RCB’s favour.Later, some lusty blows from Liam Livingstone (25 off 15 balls) and Romario Shepherd (17 off 9 balls) helped RCB post 190 — a score that was below par in Ahmedabad but ultimately enough.Another key facet of this year’s RCB team has been their bowling.After winning Qualifier 1 in Mullanpur, Josh Hazlewood had said RCB had all their bowling bases covered.“I think we’ve just got all bases covered. Any one of the five or six bowlers can bowl at any moment of the game — start, middle, or end,” he had said.Hazlewood’s words turned prophetic in the final.This time, it was Krunal Pandya’s moment to shine. The left-arm spinner bowled a high-quality spell, finishing with 2 for 17. It wasn’t just the wickets of Prabhsimran Singh and the dangerous-looking Josh Inglis — he bowled 11 dot balls, draining the momentum from Punjab’s chase.For Punjab, Shashank Singh (61* off 30 balls) fought valiantly. He smashed 22 runs in Hazlewood’s last over, and if he had connected that full toss on the first ball, it might have been a different story.But perhaps, it was written in the stars. The one-lakh-strong crowd — 90,000 of them wearing Kohli’s No. 18 jersey — desperately wanted the legend to lift the trophy after 18 long years.A couple of years ago, after a disappointing season for the Smriti Mandhana-led RCB team in the Women’s Premier League, Kohli had opened his heart to them, sharing the weight of his frustration over the years.“If we don’t win, I’m not going to go to my grave thinking — ‘Only if I had won the IPL, I would’ve been a happy man dying.’ It doesn’t happen like that,” he had said.June 3 will be remembered as the day Virat Kohli found redemption — when he couldn’t hold back his emotions, burst into tears, and was mobbed by his teammates. He will no longer carry that one unfulfilled wish to his grave.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) won their maiden IPL title. RCB defeated Punjab Kings (PBKS) by six runs.

'Daring, Dynamic, Different': Ponting hails PBKS young guns despite final loss





With the bat, ball, or in the field, Krunal Pandya has always produced magic for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in this year's IPL. Krunal was the engine on which the RCB team functioned throughout the season, and it was the 34-year-old who played a pivotal role in ending Bengaluru's long 18-year wait.Krunal picked up the crucial wickets of Prabhsimran Singh and Josh Inglis and gave away only 17 runs from his four-over quota. He was introduced after the powerplay and squeezed Punjab Kings' run flow, bowling 12 dot balls — which proved to be gold dust for RCB in their quest for a first title.The lone boundary Krunal conceded was the six Josh Inglis hit on the first ball of his third over, but he came back brilliantly in the next five balls, conceding just a single. He bowled flat, quick, and varied his pace to perfection, leaving the Punjab Kings’ batters at sea while facing him.""When we batted in the first innings, I was sitting outside and chatting with batters. I realised the slower you bowl, the better,"" he said at the post-match presentation.""But in this format, as a bowler, you need guts to do that because the margin of error is small. I just backed myself and thought that if I’m able to vary my pace and keep it more on the slower side, I’ll create chances rather than just coming and firing it in.""What has been my biggest strength is learning what the situation requires. I’ve always backed my gut and instinct. Today also, I realised if I have to take a couple of wickets, I have to be brave. If you bowled quick on that surface, it would’ve been a good batting wicket. But if you varied your pace, there was some help."" Virat Kohli showered praise on Krunal and called his spell game-changing in the final.""Krunal Pandya's spell will be remembered for a long time. He made the difference in this final.""Punjab Kings head coach Ricky Ponting pointed out that it was Krunal’s spell where his team lost momentum.""Krunal Pandya did an exceptional job with the overs that he bowled,"" Ponting told reporters after the match.""The game was starting to slip away around the 11th, 12th, and 13th overs, and the hole got too big,"" he said while referring to Krunal’s fantastic spell.Not only Ponting, Punjab skipper Shreyas Iyer also credited Krunal for his exceptional bowling performance.""They bowled brilliantly, especially Krunal. He carries a lot of experience; he has done it over a period of time. I believe that was the turning point,"" said Shreyas.This was Krunal's fourth IPL title, and he has played a significant role in winning two IPL finals.Interestingly, it was not the first time Krunal Pandya turned an IPL final on its head. In 2017, playing for Mumbai Indians against Rising Pune Supergiant, Krunal played an exceptional 38-ball 47 in a low-scoring final in Hyderabad. He now becomes the first player to win the Player of the Match award in two IPL finals.Krunal finished the season with 17 wickets and 109 runs. But those numbers don't tell the full story of his contribution to RCB.Let’s jog down memory lane. On April 27 in New Delhi, the southpaw was struggling. He was going nowhere in his innings, Mitchell Starc was troubling him with searing pace, and Dushmantha Chameera then cracked him on the helmet with a short ball. Krunal had 25 off 28 and looked utterly stuck, with RCB needing 84 off 46.He hit 48 off his last 19 balls and steered his team to a comfortable six-wicket win with nine balls to spare.RCB head coach Andy Flower called him a big-match player this season.""Krunal is a big-match player and a great competitor,"" he said at the press conference.Indeed, Krunal has been a warrior for RCB throughout this season and, in the truest sense, has been Bengaluru’s ""Man Friday.""","Krunal picked up crucial wickets of Prabhsimran Singh and Josh Inglis and gave away only 17 runs from his four-over quota. He bowled flat, quick, and varied his pace to perfection, leaving the Punjab Kings’ batters at sea. Virat Kohli showered praise on Krunal and called his spell game-changing.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121612204,imgsize-15354,width-400,resizemode-4/121612204.jpg"
NFL insider says Saquon Barkley may surpass his record-breaking 2024 season under new Eagles offensive coordinator in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-insider-says-saquon-barkley-may-surpass-his-record-breaking-2024-season-under-new-eagles-offensive-coordinator-in-2025/articleshow/121611986.cms,"Saquon Barkley's 2025 prospects (Image credit: Imagn Images)

Saquon Barkley is more than a running back—he's the Eagles’ offensive engine

Contract, Madden cover, and a championship mindset





Saquon Barkley is entering the 2025 NFL season with momentum, motivation, and a mission. After a record-breaking 2024 that saw him rush for 2,005 yards and 13 touchdowns, the Philadelphia Eagles star isn’t just running it back, he’s gearing up to level up.More than just a dual-threat back, Saquon Barkley has become the centerpiece of an offense that’s as dynamic as it is dangerous. With the Eagles chasing a second straight Super Bowl title, NFL insiders believe Barkley could play an even larger role this year.ESPN's Jeff Darlington put it best, ""The other component that could add to it is if teams do somehow decide to figure out... to stop the tush push, you could actually see Saquon's touchdown total go up even higher,"" Darlington said. ""So, to me, I know it sounds crazy but I don't necessarily know that we've seen Saquon's ceiling.""That quote says it all. Barkley, already at the peak of his powers, might still have room to grow, especially if the Eagles are forced to adapt their short-yardage game plan. If the controversial ""tush push"" quarterback sneak is neutralized by defenses, it opens the door for Barkley to dominate goal-line carries. That would significantly increase his red zone volume, making him an even bigger fantasy football RB1 and a prime MVP contender in 2025.Fresh off a $41.2 million extension, the largest deal for any running back in NFL history Barkley isn’t just motivated; he’s trusted. His value to the Eagles goes beyond stats—he’s a locker room leader and the heartbeat of their run-first strategy.Now the face of Madden NFL 26, Barkley has officially joined the NFL’s most marketable elite. While some fans worry about the infamous “Madden curse,” Barkley appears unfazed and laser-focused on the Eagles’ mission to repeat as Super Bowl champions.Also read: Trevon Diggs risks losing $500K for skipping Cowboys’ OTAs while rehabbing in Miami With Jalen Hurts under center, an elite offensive line in front of him, and a coaching staff that knows how to weaponize his skills, Barkley is set up for another monster year. If defenses key in on stopping Hurts' QB sneak, it only increases Barkley’s path to historic numbers.","Saquon Barkley is entering the 2025 NFL season with momentum, motivation, and a mission.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach. It became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118066912,imgsize-31572,width-400,resizemode-4/118066912.jpg"

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.
