T20 World Cup squad selection: Hardik Pandya in focus as Ajit Agarkar set to meet Rohit Sharma in Delhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-squad-selection-hardik-pandya-in-focus-as-ajit-agarkar-set-to-meet-rohit-sharma-in-delhi/articleshow/109653681.cms,"(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Chairman of the national selection committee Ajit Agarkar and skipper Rohit Sharma are set to hold an informal meeting in the national capital to discuss a potential 15-member squad for the T20 World Cup in the Americas.The official announcement is likely to take place in Mumbai on May 1, which is the cut-off date for the ICC event.It is understood that Agarkar specifically flew to Delhi for Saturday's IPL match between Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals, as this provided him an opportunity to have a discussion with Rohit and gain further clarity before meeting with his colleagues to finalize the team selection.Also See: T20 World Cup Schedule There are a couple of slots which will be up for discussion as most of the team picks itself. There won't be many surprises and the only thing that the selection committee and team management needs to be convinced about isHardik Pandya 's bowling fitness.If Hardik is slotted in the 15, then only one among Shivam Dube and Rinku Singh can be accommodated while it seems that KL Rahul, one of the favourites of the current coaching dispensation headed by Rahul Dravid, has left his nearest competitor Sanju Samson far behind.There is very little possibility of a left-field selection and one option could be Mumbai Indians batter Tilak Varma, who is a flamboyant southpaw and can also bowl handy off-spin in case opposition has more left-handers.However, it can't be ascertained how much is the possibility of that happening as Axar Patel and Ravi Bishnoi are fighting for the third spinner's slot.Yuzvendra Chahal, the country's most skillful white ball wrist spinner, is reportedly not a priority choice for an influential member of the coaching staff, who has a lot of say in selection matters.","The official announcement is likely to take place in Mumbai on May 1, which is the cut-off date for the ICC event.

NEW DELHI: Sanju Samson's blistering knock of 71 runs from just 33 deliveries, featuring four elegant maximums, overshadowed KL Rahul's comparatively sedate 76 off 48 balls.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad are set to clash in a pivotal encounter at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Sunday.SRH, known for their aggressive approach from the outset, will face off against CSK, a team that favours building a solid foundation before unleashing a late assault.Also See: IPL Orange Cap Under the guidance of coach Daniel Vettori and captain Pat Cummins, Sunrisers have embraced a ""brave"" batting philosophy, which they have adhered to even in challenging situations, such as their recent defeat against Royal Challengers Bengaluru at their home ground.CSK have every reason to be cautious, considering the formidable batting lineup of Sunrisers, who have amassed four scores exceeding 200 runs this season.With power-hitters like Abhishek Sharma , Travis Head , and Heinrich Klaasen , all ranked among the top-15 in the 'most sixes' category, SRH possess a daunting batting unit. The CSK bowling attack may need to deliver an exceptional performance to keep the visitors in check.The standout performer for SRH is undoubtedly Travis Head, who has the ability to single-handedly take the game away from the opposition if he gets going.In their recent match against RCB, off-spinner Will Jacks successfully dismissed Head early in the powerplay by pitching the ball well outside off-stump and turning it away from the left-hander. It will be intriguing to observe if CSK employs a similar strategy with Moeen Ali, who possesses the skill to turn the ball effectively.In the history of the IPL, Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad have clashed 20 times. The head-to-head record tilts heavily in favour of Chennai Super Kings, who have emerged victorious in 14 encounters, while Sunrisers Hyderabad have secured wins in 6 matches. This historical data underscores CSK's dominance over SRH in their IPL encounters.In the last 10 IPL matches at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, teams batting second have held a slight advantage, winning 6 out of 10 encounters. The average first innings score stands at 165 runs, with the average winning score in the first innings being 181.Teams have been scoring at an average of 52 runs in the powerplay overs and 48 runs in the death overs, indicating a balanced performance throughout the innings.In IPL 2024, the MA Chidambaram Stadium has witnessed 3 matches, where teams batting second have emerged victorious twice. The average first innings total recorded is 172 runs, while teams batting second have chased down an average total of 153 runs.This suggests that the pitch dynamics at the venue have favoured chasing teams slightly in the recent edition of the tournament, with competitive scores being posted by both batting first and second.The Chepauk pitch at the MA Chidambaram Stadium provides assistance to both spinners and pacers, posing challenges for batsmen to score freely. The conditions typically favor the bowlers, making run-scoring a tough task.Additionally, with dew expected to set in later during the match, the team batting second is likely to have an advantage, as the wetter conditions could make it easier to play shots and chase down targets effectively.1. Given the assistance provided to spinners on the Chepauk pitch, fantasy team managers may prioritize selecting quality spin bowlers who can exploit the conditions and pick up wickets. Spinners are likely to play a crucial role in restricting the opposition's scoring and accumulating fantasy points through wickets and economy rate.2. With dew expected to come later in the day, teams batting second could have an advantage due to the wetter conditions making it easier to play shots and chase down targets. Fantasy team managers may consider this factor when selecting their players, especially batsmen from teams likely to bat second, as they could capitalize on the dew and contribute significantly to their team's total.Ruturaj Gaikwad, Ajinkya Rahane, Daryl Mitchell, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali, MS Dhoni, Deepak Chahar, Tushar Deshpande, Mustafizur Rahman, Matheesha PathiranaShardul ThakurAbhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Aiden Markram, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Pat Cummins, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mayank Markande, Jaydev UnadkatT NatarajanIPL 2024 Stats: 325 Runs in 7 MatchesTravis Head presents an appealing fantasy prospect with his IPL 2024 performance statistics, having accumulated 325 runs in just 7 matches leading up to the upcoming fixture against CSK. With a commendable run-scoring record and consistency throughout the tournament, Head emerges as a valuable fantasy selection, offering the potential for significant contributions to the team's total and thereby accruing fantasy points.IPL 2024 Stats: 157 runs and 4 wickets in 8 MatchesRavindra Jadeja holds notable fantasy value based on his IPL 2024 performance statistics, having contributed with 157 runs and 4 wickets in 8 matches leading up to the upcoming clash against SRH. With his dual ability as a batsman and a bowler, Jadeja offers versatility to fantasy teams, capable of making impactful contributions across both departments and accumulating fantasy points.IPL 2024 Stats: 275 runs in 8 MatchesHeinrich Klaasen of SRH emerges as an enticing fantasy pick with his IPL 2024 performance stats, amassing 275 runs in 8 matches ahead of the upcoming fixture. Along with his traits with the gloves from behind the stumps, his consistent run-scoring ability positions him as a valuable asset for fantasy teams.Heinrich KlaasenRuturaj Gaikwad, Ajinkya Rahane, Travis Head, Aiden Markram, Shivam DubeNitish Reddy, Ravindra JadejaMatheesha Pathirana, Mustafizur Rahman, Pat Cummins","Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad face off at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.

"Yesterday IPL Match Highlights: Rajasthan take 'royal' stride towards play-off, beat Lucknow Super Giants by 7 wickets",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/lsg-vs-rr-ipl-2024-highlights-rajasthan-take-royal-stride-towards-play-off-beat-lucknow-super-giants-by-7-wickets/articleshow/109653861.cms,"(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: Sanju Samson 's unbeaten 71 off 33 balls, which included four stylish sixes, had a significantly greater impact than his counterpart KL Rahul 's more measured 76 off 48 balls as the Rajasthan Royals comfortably defeated the Lucknow Super Giants by seven wickets on Saturday. This victory was crucial for the Royals as they made a significant step towards the IPL playoffs.While Rahul remains the favorite to be Rishabh Pant's backup wicketkeeper for the T20 World Cup, Samson's performance, including hitting the winning six in a chase of 197, keeps him in contention for a spot on the flight to the US.Samson and Jurel came together when the Royals lost momentum after a strong start, forming a solid partnership of 121 runs in just 62 balls for the unbeaten fourth wicket, guiding their team to victory.Despite facing a challenging target of 197 with LSG using seven bowlers, including two leg-spinners, Rajasthan finished at 199 for three, securing the win with an over to spare.On his part, the young Jurel finally discovered his mojo to put behind a barren run, smacking five fours and two sixes to make a sturdy 52 not out off 34 balls.The win took top-placed Rajasthan to 16 points — six clear from the second-best Kolkata Knight Riders — and a step closer to become the first team to reach the playoffs in the 17th edition. The play-offs cut-off this year is likely to be 18 points if one goes by the current mid-table muddle.LSG remained on fourth spot with 10 points in bag.Rajasthan openers Yashasvi Jaiswal (24) and Jos Buttler (34) knocked off 60 runs from the target unscathed, but their side went through a slump in the following overs while also losing three wickets in quick succession.It began with Buttler walking across his stumps to miss an angled full toss from Thakur, who knocked down the leg-stump for the first breakthrough.Marcus Stoinis bowled an innocuous delivery outside off to invite a free-flowing Jaiswal to go for it. The left-hander obliged but did not connect well, finding Bishnoi at deep point.LSG's plans to tie the Royals down with leg-spin became evident when the 41-year-old Amit Mishra came on as impact substitute and got the priced scalp of Riyan Parag (11) in his first over.Rajasthan slipped from 60 for no loss to 78/3 after nine, and this was when Jurel and Samson began their recovery work to put Rajasthan back on track again.Jurel and Samson began with a six and a four respectively off Mishra to push the leg-spinner on the backfoot and took 17 runs off Thakur's second over.Krunal Pandya (0/24) did well on his part to send down a few measly overs in between but RR were back on charge again when Mohsin Khan came on in the 14th over.Jurel hit the left-armer for 20 runs including three fours and a six in Mohsin's third of the game and also enjoyed a reprieve when Thakur, placed at short third man, dropped a crucial catch when the RR batter was on 32.Bishnoi's introduction as late as in the 16th over had no impact whatsoever, with RR having grasped full control of the proceedings. The leg-spinner leaked another 16 runs as RR inched closer to the finish line.Earlier in the first half, Rahul (76 off 48 balls) dug deep with Deepak Hooda (50 off 31 balls) as Lucknow Super Giants managed a competitive 196/5 against Rajasthan Royals.Rahul and Hooda gave LSG a solid footing with a 62-ball 115-run stand for the third wicket after early blows, but the failure of others meant the hosts could not capitalise on the hard work by the two.Rahul's 48-ball 76 with eight fours and two sixes was his fourth fifty of the season while Hooda banished his poor string of scores to make his first big score this IPL.","Rajasthan Royals beat Lucknow Super Giants by seven wickets in IPL.

KOLKATA: The Kolkata Knight Riders dominated the Delhi Capitals recording a massive 106-run victory when the two sides last met in the ongoing IPL earlier this month. But things are unlikely to be the same when they clash again, this time at the Eden Gardens here on Monday.The Rishabh Pant-led side has since been on the rise recording four wins in their last five games to be on 10 points after as many games.In contrast, the Knights look a bit shaky after losing two and managing to pull off a narrow one-run victory in their last three games at home. Although still firmly in the playoff race with 10 points from eight matches, KKR know, in case of further slips, they might be in trouble.Bowling remains KKR's Achilles heel as they have struggled to defend high totals. All their bowlers, except Sunil Narine , are leaking runs. With Mitchell Starc 's availability is still uncertain, KKR desperately need to get their bowling combination right. As their assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate said, the bowlers need to show heart and develop anti-skill bowling.In the batting department, it's time their middle-order step on the gas as it will be expecting too much fromPhil Salt and Narine to get them off the block in such fine fashion every day.After Jos Buttler and Jonny Bairstow, both of whom hit centuries in winning causes against KKR at the Eden Gardens, all eyes will be on DC opener Jake Fraser McGurk who has lit up this IPL in recent times smashing 247 runs in five innings at a strike rate of 237.50.The visitors will hope the 22-year-old Australian, who was drafted in once Lungi Ngidi was ruled out of the tournament, will give another breezy start and provide the platform for Pant, regaining his own form, and Tristan Stubbs to fire down the order as DC will look for revenge. However, the side will continue to miss injured David Warner and Ishant Sharma.Interestingly, DC will have a lot of local input about the Eden track which is proving to be one of the high scoring venues of this tournament. The presence of city boy Sourav Ganguly as DC's Director of Cricket in the rival dugout can even split KKR's support base on Monday.On the ground, Bengal cricketers Abhishek Porel and Mukesh Kumar would love to make meaningful contributions in their 'home' match. While Porel is playing important cameo roles, Mukesh has emerged as a 'death' bowler for the Capitals.DC has been the most successful side in this IPL in terms of spin, with their slower bowlers claiming 21 wickets so far.The team's leading wicket-taker Kuldeep Yadav, who claimed to have some bitter experience with his old franchise side, will love to prove a point or two against them. The Chinaman bowler is getting good support from Axar Patel who has often kept things tidy.DC are likely to continue with pacer Rasikh Salam as an impact sub which has worked well for them.In all it will be a high-stake game for both.","Rishabh Pant-led side has since been on the rise recording four wins in their last five games to be on 10 points after as many games.

Third opener and second wicketkeeper

Sticking with tried and tested seam attack

Power game in the middle

NEW DELHI: With the deadline to announce the teams for the upcoming T20 World Cup fast approaching, the selection committee and the team management have been working overtime to strike the right combination.By no means, this is going to be a straightforward selection for the Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee.He was in the Capital on Saturday to watch the match between Delhi Capitals and Mumbai Indians. It is speculated that Agarkar had an informal meeting with Rohit Sharma about the team.According to sources, there are three major contentious issues that need to be resolved before BCCI secretary Jay Shah convenes the meeting to formally announce the 15-member team. The team is slated to leave for the World Cup on May 21 with the players who will be out of the IPL by then.TOI understands that the selectors are torn between Sanju Samson and KL Rahul for the second wicketkeeper-batsman slot with Rishabh Pant having done enough to prove his fitness and form to be the first choice for this position.Rahul's intent at the top of the order has always been debatable. However, as the ongoing IPL season has progressed, the picture has changed with two young openers - Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill - looking off the boil. Both Rahul and Samson's international records are not great. But Gill, with his struggling form in the IPL, doesn't command automatic selection yet.This is where Rahul could pip Samson in the race even though Samson has been having a dream season while leading Rajasthan Royals. Rahul's experience at the top of the order and his willingness to bat in the middle order gives him a chance.With Mohammed Shami injured, the Indian seam attack suddenly looks shaky. The IPL has been particularly cruel on the bowlers with team totals touching unprecedented highs. Sources told TOI that the team management wants to stick with the lot which has been part of the setup for the last two-three years even though. Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj have gone for around nine runs per over so far in the IPL.""The team management wants to trust the players it has groomed. There are concerns about Siraj and Arshdeep going for so many runs but one has to look at the context. In these matches, you have to think about defending the target set by your team-even if you do it by 10 runs. Jasprit Bumrah is different class. The others should not be compared with him. There won't be 'impact player' rule in the World Cup. Axar Patel, for example, has been exemplary with his economy rate,"" the source told TOI.Bowlers who could give them competition are Avesh Khan and Mukesh Kumar who have been growing into the role of bowling the tough overs. The selectors will have to decide if they want to go in with an extra spinner Ravi Bishnoi or the extra pacer because Hardik Pandya's seam bowling can't be ignored. Bishnoi is seen as someone who can bowl at any stage of an innings.The biggest challenge will be to have the power hitters in the middle order. Rohit and Virat Kohli have been steady run-getters but the onus to post humongous scores will fall on power-hitters in the middle and late middle-order. The striking abilities of Hardik and Ravindra Jadeja have not been very inspiring.The team management had groomed Rinku Singh for that role. Shivam Dube has also emerged as an option. But him not bowling enough may pull him down a bit. Sources say the selection committee isn't keen on getting swayed by IPL performances but someone like Tilak Varma can't be ruled out.",The deadline to announce the teams for the upcoming T20 World Cup fast approaching.

Hardik Pandya 's elevation to the Mumbai Indians captaincy has not gone down too well with the loyal fans of the five-time champions as he replaced the highly successful Rohit Sharma , a bonafide India legend and also the all-format national team captain.While some of the booing and hooting at the Wankhede has been toxic and unnecessary, the skipper has not done too much on the field to change the perceptions about him off it.Not bowling Jasprit Bumrah straight up, changing the playing XI repeatedly, changing his own batting slot constantly, he has shown all signs of a confused and a stressed leader. What's worse, it doesn't seem as if he has the dressing room pulling in one direction.What many felt was needless after the team's 10-run loss to Delhi Capitals was his criticism of Tilak Varma , the team's top run scorer with 63 off 32 balls, saying his lack of intent against Axar Patel cost MI the game.""Axar bowling to a left-hander (read Tilak), the better option could have been to go after him,"" Hardik told the official broadcasters after the game. ""I think it was just a little game awareness that we missed out. At the end of the day, that cost us the game.""Really? Let's analyse. Axar Patel bowled six balls to the promising left-hander off which he scored 14 runs. He had bowled to Tilak when MI had scored 72 for 3. Hardik was batting with Axar in the middle as MI had lost the wicket ofSuryakumar Yadav with the team score at 65.Tilak scored four off four balls off Axar in an attempt to momentarily consolidate till Hardik got his eye in. Once the partnership was set, he hit Axar for a six and a four prompting DC skipper Rishabh Pant to take him out of the attack.Moreover, if Hardik wanted Tilak to attack, wasn't he the best man to tell him as he was in the middle?If the skipper really wants to look at the reasons for MI's loss on Saturday, may be a closer look at his bowling figures 2-0-41-0 and the decision in sending an in-form Tim David out to bat at No. 7 on a small ground, may provide those.Picking on a youngster scouted and groomed by the franchise and an ex-skipper's favourite, won't help.",Hardik Pandya's elevation to the Mumbai Indians captaincy has not gone down too well with the loyal fans of the five-time champions.

NEW DELHI: Captain Ruturaj Gaikwad 's aggressive 98, paired with a precise bowling performance led by pacer Tushar Deshpande , guided the Chennai Super Kings to a 78-run victory over the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League on Sunday.After being invited to bat, Gaikwad's impressive 54-ball innings powered CSK to a formidable 212 for three. He was supported by Daryl Mitchell 's return to form, contributing a key 52 off 32 balls, while Shivam Dube added an unbeaten 39 off 20 balls to push CSK past the 200 mark.In response, SRH's overly cautious batting approach failed once again as they couldn't recover from Deshpande's (4/27 in 3 overs) early three-wicket burst and the subsequent pressure in the middle overs, ultimately being bowled out for 134 in 18.5 overs. This win ended CSK's two-game losing streak.With the victory, CSK climbed to third place with 10 points, the same as the Kolkata Knight Riders, Lucknow Super Giants, and Delhi Capitals. SRH, also with 10 points, fell to fourth after their fourth loss.Chasing 213 to win, Travis Head (13) and Abhishek Sharma (15) made rapid starts but Deshpande got rid of the former with a slower wide ball and then returned to remove impact sub Anmolpreet Singh with an outswinger on the stumps as the batter went for a golden duck.Abhishek was next caught at deep point as Deshpande broke their back, leaving SRH at 40 for 3 in the fourth over.Nitish Reddy (15) and Aiden Markram (32) tried to steady the ship but Ravindra Jadeja bamboozled the former with a bouncer, while Matheesha Pathirana produced a superb yorker to uproot the middle stump of the South African.At 85-5 in 10.5 overs, Heinrich Klaasen and Abdul Samad joined hands but runs were tough to come by as the bowlers executed their plans to perfectly.While Jadeja completed a superb spell of 4-0-22-1, Shardul Thakur kept bowling at wide outside off to frustrate the batters as CSK conceded just two boundaries in nine overs after the powerplay.With an improbable 104 needed off 30 balls, Klaasen, Samad, Pat Cummins and Shahbaz Ahmed all holed out as Mitchell claimed five catches in the outfield during the match.Earlier, Gaikwad missed out on a successive hundred by a whisker but his 107-run stand with Mitchell was the cornerstone of CSK's innings. It is CSK's 35th 200-plus total, the most by any side in T20 cricket.Gaikwad was the star of the CSK batting as he hit 10 fours and three sixes in his innings.Opening the innings, Ajinkya Rahane (9) perished early again with Bhuvneshwar Kumar earning his prized wicket in the third over but Gaikwad kept CSK going. The skipper did not back down and attacked the bowlers at will as the hosts ended the powerplay at 50 for one.In no time, the 27-year-old Gaikwad brought up his 17th IPL half-century off just 27 deliveries.Gaikwad and Mitchell batted sensibly as they managed to keep the boundaries coming, with the latter chipping in periodically too after a slow start (12 off 11).With dew setting in the 12th over, the batting duo tried to take advantage of it as Mitchell soon brought up his maiden IPL 50 off 29 deliveries in the 13th over.But the New Zealander failed to get going for too long and perished in the following over to Jaydev Unadkat after depositing a full-toss into the hands of Nitish Kumar Reddy in the deep mid-wicket.In-form Shivam Dube then joined Gaikwad and the two decided to up the ante. SRH skipper Pat Cummins was targeted by the batters, having been dispatched for 49 in his four overs.Gaikwad looked set to back-to-back tons but the heat and humidity of Chennai seemed to affect him as his vigil ended with a tired-looking shot as T Natarajan sent him back in the final over.Crowd-favourite MS Dhoni scored five off two deliveries that included a four, while Dube deposited a full toss in the stands as the final four overs yielded 53 runs.",Chennai Super Kings beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 78 runs. Captain Ruturaj Gaikwad top scored with 98 off 54 balls. Daryl Mitchell made 52 off 32 balls. Shivam Dube added 39 off 20 balls to push CSK past 200 mark.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109671448,imgsize-103520,width-400,resizemode-4/109671448.jpg"

However, the intriguing twist came with Doull's decision to assign Pant the No. 3 batting position, a move aimed at accommodating other players in the lineup.""I have flipped and flopped a lot about this, but I want Rishabh Pant at No. 3 because I can't see fitting the other players in without my keeper batting at No. 3.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) pacer Mohammed Siraj expressed frustration over the challenging conditions for bowlers in T20 cricket , lamenting the lack of assistance from smaller grounds and flat pitches.Siraj highlighted the trend of teams consistently surpassing the 250-run mark in this IPL season, a testament to the ultra-aggressive batting approach and the influence of the 'Impact player' rule.With batsmen capitalising on favourable conditions, bowlers face an uphill battle in containing high-scoring totals. Siraj's remarks shed light on the evolving dynamics of T20 cricket, where batsmen hold the upper hand in exploiting conducive playing surfaces to set daunting targets.""See, nowadays cricket is really different, now 250-260 is made in every second match, earlier 250 was a rare thing,"" said Siraj after RCB overhauled the 201-run target set by Gujarat Titans in 16 overs in Ahmedabad.""There is no help for bowlers, there are smaller grounds and flat wickets, there is no swing in the ball, so lots of changes. Bowlers can just keep playing and keep getting hit.""Life has indeed been challenging for bowlers, particularly in this IPL season, as teams prioritise aggressive batting to maintain high run-rates throughout the innings, even beyond the powerplay overs.""As a bowler, you have to keep the self-belief. I have seen lots of ups and downs in life, so I don't give up if 1-2 matches don't go my way. I look for a comeback,"" Siraj said.""After one month, there is the World Cup... so I tell myself that if I get hit on a good ball, it is fine but I need to keep bowling less bad balls. I have not really bowled too badly this IPL, now 40 runs (in quota of four overs) is normal in T20 cricket.""Siraj, with six wickets in nine IPL games this season, acknowledged the significant role of luck in T20 cricket.""T20 is all about luck, you don't get a wicket with good balls and sometimes even a full toss gets you a wicket. so luck matters a lot. I keep working on my flaws during training.""My mindset is always like I am the best bowler, when I go to the field, my attitude and mindset remains the same and it helps in my execution.""Despite Gujarat Titans enduring their third loss in four games, Sai Sudharsan maintained that there are no glaring issues within the team. However, he emphasised the critical importance of winning all remaining matches to bolster their chances of qualifying for the playoffs.""I don't think many things are going wrong. As a team we are doing well, definitely. It's just the result. If we had won this game, maybe many things would have been good. Getting better and just showing up (for) the next game is what is very important,"" said Sudharsan, who hit a 49-ball 84.GT are now at seventh place with eight points in the IPL standings.""I think winning all the games is the only possibility which we can see.

So, we just have to play the way we want.""The left-handed batter said the pitch eased out with time which helped RCB chase down the target without much ado.""Like 10-15 overs after when we were batting, it got a little better because when we started to play, the wicket was q little damp but eventually it got better under the lights.

Like losing their head coach Des Buckingham who left the club to take over at hometown club Oxford United last November.Like losing key players like Greg Stewart and Rostyn Griffiths , who both parted ways with Mumbai City in January.Like signing Spanish striker Iker Guarrotxena in the January window, only to then lose him for the remainder of the season to a knee injury. Each time, Mumbai bounced back to ensure their league form didn't suffer and eventually only missed out on becoming the first team in the competition to defend the League Winners Shield after a gutting final-day loss to Mohun Bagan Super Giant in Kolkata.It was that same resilience that surfaced at a critical juncture last Wednesday, as Mumbai stunned the hosts with three late goals to snatch an incredible victory that has now put them in a favourable position to reach the Indian Super League final next Saturday.Ahead of Monday's return leg at the Mumbai Football Arena, Kratky, who took charge in December, spoke glowingly about the character of his team, but made it a point to play down their one-goal advantage.""It wasn't easy, there were a couple of setbacks as everyone knows but we can be proud of ourselves how we have handled it and how we kept going,"" the Czech-Australian said at his pre-match press conference. ""What I really like in this group is they stick together in hard times and push through it, so I'm very proud of every single one of them.""That said, he was keen to remind his side about the importance of stepping onto the pitch on Monday with the right approach.
