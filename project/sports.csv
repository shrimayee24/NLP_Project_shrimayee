The Internet Reacts—Criticism, Defenses, and Calls for Saquon Barkley to Stay Focused

Timing is Everything—Why Is This Resurfacing Now?



Check out our live coverage of Super Bowl LIX and find details on how to watch Super Bowl live on Times of India.



The internet has a long memory, and right now, it’s turning against Anna Congdon , fiancée of Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley . Just as the NFL world shifts its focus to the upcoming Super Bowl, Congdon has found herself at the center of controversy.Old tweets from over a decade ago have resurfaced, and they’re sparking major backlash online. The posts, which reportedly contain racial slurs—including the N-word in Disney movie titles—have ignited a wave of criticism, with many questioning her past actions and calling for accountability. Social media users wasted no time in digging up the problematic content, leading to heated discussions about whether past mistakes should define a person today.Screenshots from 2012 and 2013, when Congdon was around 13 years old, have been making rounds online, showing her casually using offensive language in tweets. Some of the resurfaced posts include:A play on Kanye West’s “Gold Digger” lyrics, where she wrote,A hashtag game where she swapped words in Disney movie titles with racial slurs, such asWhen a friend pointed out she should add an “s,” she doubled down, replying,A tweet from 2013 where she said sheThis isn’t the first time these tweets have surfaced. Back in 2018, when the controversy initially blew up, Congdon swiftly deleted most of her Twitter history before 2015. However, with screenshots resurfacing now, the internet is once again divided. Some are calling her out for the language, while others argue that these were tweets from her teenage years and should be left in the past.Another major talking point? Her biracial children. Some commenters are now questioning whether she still uses such language in private, especially around her kids. Meanwhile, Barkley’s supporters are urging him to ignore the drama and focus on his Super Bowl run.Interestingly, the timing of this scandal isn’t random. It comes just as Congdon’s recent engagement to Barkley was revealed—though reports say the proposal actually happened six months ago. Whether the timing is a coincidence or calculated, the controversy is stealing headlines right before one of the biggest moments in Barkley’s career.For now, neither Barkley nor Congdon has publicly addressed the resurfaced tweets. But in the world of social media, nothing stays buried forever.Also read - Bill Belichick & Jordon Hudson Spark Engagement Rumors with Two Rings—She Addresses One, But What About the Other?","Anna Congdon’s old tweets from over a decade ago have resurfaced.

Super Bowl 59 Ticket Prices Are 17% Cheaper Than Last Year’s; Find Out Why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/super-bowl-59-ticket-prices-are-17-cheaper-than-last-years-find-out-why/articleshow/118090085.cms,"The stage is set for this year’s Super Bowl. Source: Getty

From Size Of The Venue to Fan Fatigue, A Few Key Factors Decide Super Bowl Ticket Prices

Super Bowl 59 may very well be one of the most talked-about and heavily publicised Super Bowls in NFL history. Not only is the Kansas City Chiefs aiming for a rare three-peat, but the team’s tight end Travis Kelce is in a relationship with the most popular pop star of her generation, Taylor Swift. However, ticket prices this year for Super Bowl LIX are down significantly ahead of Sunday's game.StubHub reported this week that the ""Get In"" price was $3,229 which is 5 per cent lower than the previous day and down 43 per cent compared to this time last year. However, StubHub spokesperson Adam Budelli recently broke down why there are a few practical reasons for this.According to reports, more than 4,700 tickets are available on StubHub on Wednesday night. The average ticket price has reportedly dropped to about $6,900, which marks a 17% drop from last year. However, Budelli explains that this is not unnatural since the price drop depends upon the Caesars Superdome’s ability to accommodate over 15,000 more fans, the availability of hotel rooms, and to some extent, fan fatigue.There are 74,295 seats and six levels in the Caesars Superdome. However, the two suite levels at the Superdome are privately owned and hence exclusive. 7 per cent of all tickets sold have been buyers from Kansas or Missouri, which is surprising since this is a big game for the Kansas City Chiefs.But Budelli shares, “They’ve seen their team win. It’s hard to justify spending $10,000, year after year, if you’ve already seen it.” Budelli told AP that some tickets are still available, but they are being sold quickly.Also Read: What is Super Bowl and why is everyone googling it? “Compared to last year, which was the most expensive Super Bowl in history on StubHub, that’s actually down 56%, making this Super Bowl much more approachable — I don’t want to say affordable — when compared to last year,” Budelli said.As per Ticketmaster, historically, the average resale ticket to the Super Bowl has ranged between $4,000 and $6,000; the platform has also pointed out that the ticket price “fluctuates drastically” based on the game's location, the lineup, seat location, and date of purchase.Budelli also pointed out that the venue for last year’s Super Bowl was a big reason for the inflated prices of its tickets. Last year, the game was held in Las Vegas and the three-hour game was turned into a week full of festivities for attending fans which hiked up the prices. Budelli shared that this year’s ticket prices are more in line with the 2023 rates.We’ve seen a 14% increase in ticket purchases from Kansas City Chiefs fans. Now, the gap is around 15% from Pennsylvania and about 9% from Kansas and Missouri. While it still favours the Eagles, the numbers may improve for Chiefs fans as the weekend progresses,"" he added.Typically Super Bowl tickets get cheaper from two weeks out, reaching their lowest price on game day. In 2024, Gametime's cheapest Super Bowl ticket declined from $9,400 two weeks out to $7,100 the day of the game, which marks a 24% drop.","StubHub reported this week that the ""Get In"" price was $3,229 which is 5 per cent lower than the previous day and down 43 per cent compared to this time last year.

Jon Batiste’s Musical Journey: From Street Performances to Grammy Wins



Super Bowl LIX: What to Expect



If there’s one thing we can all agree on, it’s that the Super Bowl isn’t just about football—it’s about the spectacle, the halftime show, and of course, that iconic national anthem moment. And this year, none other than the multi-talented Jon Batiste will be delivering the “Star-Spangled Banner” before the big game kicks off.Born into the legendary Batiste family in Metairie, Louisiana, Jon Batiste has been breathing music since day one. He started on drums, but by 11, the piano had stolen his heart. He trained at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts and later polished his skills at Juilliard in New York. From street performances (he calls them ""love riots"") to global tours, this man has lived and breathed music across more than 40 countries.If you don't know Batiste from his viral street performances, you probably recognize him as the former bandleader on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. But that's just one piece of his insane career. Now let's talk about the hardware: an Academy Award for his work on Disney/Pixar's Soul , a Golden Globe, a BAFTA, a Critics' Choice Award, and oh, just five Grammy wins in one night for his album WE ARE—including Album of the Year in 2022!Batiste's musical fingerprints are everywhere. He's worked with Stevie Wonder, Prince, Willie Nelson, Lenny Kravitz, and Ed Sheeran—to name a few. He's also the Creative Director of the National Jazz Museum in Harlem and the Music Director for The Atlantic. Basically, if it involves music and culture, Batiste has probably had a hand in it.Batiste isn’t just singing the national anthem; he’s bringing soul, jazz, and a whole lot of energy to the Super Bowl stage. Expect a rendition that’s powerful, heartfelt, and uniquely Batiste. If his past performances are anything to go by, we might even see a surprise twist or two.So as the players prepare for a battle of glory in the Super Bowl, Jon Batiste is going to be the one that sets the tone for this upcoming legendary performance. Whether this is your game or you're just here for the music, one thing is for sure—the moment when Batiste comes on will not soon be forgotten.Also read - “She’s a Trump Fan!” – Donald Trump Predicts Chiefs Will Win Super Bowl, Praises Patrick Mahomes’ Wife","Jon Batiste will be singing the national anthem at the Super Bowl.

With Super Bowl LIX on the horizon, one big question looms over Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce—will this be his final game? While Kelce hasn’t made an official decision, there’s plenty of speculation about whether he’ll hang up his cleats after the season or return for another year.Kelce signed a two-year contract extension in 2024, keeping him with the Chiefs through 2025. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean he’ll play another season. His $19.8 million cap hit in 2025 could impact the Chiefs’ roster decisions, and Kelce himself has admitted he’ll need time after the Super Bowl to think about his future before free agency begins on March 12.Several factors could determine whether Kelce retires or returns:If Kelce does retire, he has plenty of opportunities outside the NFL. He’s already a media superstar with his hit podcast,, and he could easily transition into TV, acting, or even sports broadcasting. Plus, with his high-profile relationship with Taylor Swift, he might enjoy having more free time to travel and support her career.For now, Travis Kelce’s future remains uncertain, but NFL insiders believe his decision will “hinge” on the Super Bowl’s outcome. Whether he’s back for one more season or calling it quits, all eyes will be on Kelce as the Chiefs take the field for Super Bowl LIX!Also read - “I wouldn’t give a s**t” – DJ Mustard Shuts Down Super Bowl Halftime Show Rumors, Won’t Perform with Kendrick Lamar","Travis Kelce signed a two-year contract extension in 2024, keeping him with the Chiefs through 2025.

This year, The World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and the National Football League (NFL) are reportedly collaborating on a custom WWE Championship title featuring Super Bowl 59 branding this weekend in New Orleans. The NFL and WWE have signed a multi-year licensing deal to create NFL-inspired WWE legacy title belts featuring the official branding of all 32 teams. Besides New Orleans has had a long relationship with WWE and has turned host for events like WrestleMania 30 and WrestleMania 34. This begs the question, how many WWE stars will be attending the Super Bowl 59?It has been reported that the Tribal Chief will be out of action in RAW. According to Dave Meltzer in the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, Reigns’ absence was planned to keep him out of the Elimination Chamber and might be a strategy on WWE’s end to protect its top talent from losses. This move comes after Reigns’ heated confrontation with Seth Rollins and CM Punk on Raw, which ended with Rollins hitting him with two brutal Curb Stomps. It’s possible that Reigns will catch the Super Bowl in his downtime considering he is a former football player.Moreover, he has rooted for the San Francisco 49ers in the past so he clearly keeps tabs on the league’s games and may just end up at the Super Bowl.The Deadman might actually go see the Super Bowl this year. Texas-based hat maker Ala Ancha Hat Co. has just unveiled the newest piece from Undertaker’s Deadman collection. The wrestling icon is pictured with the designer wearing the creation and the post is captioned “Hanging out with @undertaker as he wears his second creation by yours truly 🎩 🎩Taker🎩 . .

He recently announced that he will be competing in this year's Elimination Chamber Match to become a 17-time champion. Last year, Netflix's Christmas NFL Event featured Cena alongside CM Punk in a special pre-game show. Naturally, the fans are curious to know if Cena will show up this year as well.Cena is a Massachusetts native and has been a lifelong fan of the New England Patriots. He was named an honourary captain for the New York Jets. But it’s possible that this year he will be focused on prepping for his big match and could skip the big game.Jey Uso just shined at the latest instalment of WWE SmackDown where his performance impressed the WWE fandom. Although he has not talked about Super Bowl this year, it’s no secret that before he was ""Main Event"" Jey Uso, he was Joshua Fatu, a linebacker who harboured dreams of playing for the NFL.

A Promise Made to His Late Father: The Story of Mink Jacket



DeAndre Hopkins’ journey to the Super Bowl is one filled with heart, hard work, and an unbreakable bond with his late father. As the wide receiver for the Kansas City Chiefs , Hopkins arrived at the Super Bowl wearing a mink jacket that holds more than just style—it carries a lifetime of memories, love, and promises kept. The jacket, a gift from his father, who tragically passed away when Hopkins was just five months old, symbolizes a legacy that DeAndre honors with every step he takes on and off the field.When DeAndre was just a baby, tragedy struck his family as his father, Harris Steve Hopkins, died in a car crash. Despite this immense loss, DeAndre has always held onto the memory of his father, especially the mink jacket that was left behind. It became a symbol of a promise he made to himself: to wear it either at his wedding or when he reached the Super Bowl. With Super Bowl LIX now a reality, Hopkins has fulfilled that promise, honoring his father’s memory in the most meaningful way.Hopkins’ journey to the NFL wasn’t without its struggles. Raised by his mother, Sabrina Greenlee, who worked tirelessly to support him and his siblings after his father’s death, DeAndre learned early on about resilience. Sabrina, who survived a horrific acid attack that left her blind, became DeAndre’s rock and source of strength. She never let her blindness stop her from supporting her son, and DeAndre’s success in the NFL has been as much a tribute to her as it has been to his late father.DeAndre’s incredible rise to NFL superstardom is not just a story of athletic prowess but a testament to his determination to succeed against the odds. After 12 seasons in the league, DeAndre is now one game away from the ultimate prize: the Super Bowl. As he steps onto the field wearing his father’s mink jacket, the weight of the promise and the sacrifices of his family are with him every step of the way.When DeAndre Hopkins walks onto the field for Super Bowl LIX, he’s not just wearing a jacket—he’s wearing the memory of his father, the love of his mother, and the support of a family that has stood by him through thick and thin. This emotional moment is a reflection of the journey that has brought him here: from a boy who lost his father too soon to a man who will forever honor his legacy with every touchdown, every pass, and every victory.Also read - Best Ways to Watch Super Bowl LIX 2025 for Free – Streaming Guide & TV Deals","DeAndre Hopkins' journey to the Super Bowl is one filled with heart, hard work, and an unbreakable bond with his late father.

Super Bowl Overtime Rule: How the NFL Decides a Winner in Case of a Tie



Super Bowl Overtime: How It Works

The New Overtime Rule And How To Play It

1. Duration of Overtime Periods

Each overtime period lasts 15 minutes, unlike the regular season, where overtime is capped at 10 minutes. This extended period ensures there’s enough time to determine a clear winner.

If the score remains tied after the first 15-minute period—or if the team that received the second possession hasn’t completed its initial drive—another overtime period begins. This process continues until a winner is declared.

2. Guaranteed Possession for Both Teams

One of the most significant differences from the regular season is that both teams are guaranteed a chance to possess the ball at least once in overtime. This rule was introduced prior to the 2022 season to address concerns about fairness.

In the regular season, if the team that receives the opening kickoff scores a touchdown, the game ends immediately. However, in the playoffs, even if the first team scores a touchdown, the opposing team still gets a chance to respond. This ensures a more balanced competition.

3. Scoring and Winning the Game

4. Timeouts and Challenges

5. Multiple Overtime Periods

6. Coin Toss and Captain’s Choice

Key Takeaways for Fans

Overtime periods are 15 minutes long, and multiple periods are played if necessary.

Both teams are guaranteed a possession, unless the receiving team commits a safety on the first drive.

The next score wins after both teams have had their chance, but extra points are skipped if the game ends on a touchdown.

There are no coach’s challenges, and each team gets three timeouts per half.

The Super Bowl has been around since 1967, yet only two editions have needed overtime to crown a champion. The first came in 2017 when the Patriots miraculously erased a 28-3 deficit against the Falcons, with Tom Brady leading New England to victory. The second occurred in 2024 when the Chiefs and 49ers battled into extra time, with Kansas City prevailing. Could history repeat itself? If another Super Bowl heads to OT, here’s what you need to know about the rules.The NFL’s overtime rules have always been a hot topic, especially in the playoffs, where games cannot end in a tie. While the format remains largely the same in the regular season and postseason, there are crucial distinctions in playoff overtime—especially after the rule changes introduced in 2022. These adjustments were implemented in response to intense matchups like the unforgettable Chiefs vs. Bills 2022 AFC Divisional Round, where Kansas City secured the win with a touchdown on their first overtime possession, leaving Buffalo without a chance to respond.In the NFL postseason, including the Super Bowl, overtime is designed to guarantee both teams a fair shot at victory while maintaining the intensity of the game. Here’s a breakdown of the key rules:""Both teams must have the opportunity to possess the ball at least once during the extra period, unless the team kicking off to start the overtime period scores a safety on the receiving team’s initial possession, in which case the team that kicked off is the winner."" – NFL RulebookThe only exception is if the team that begins with the ball commits a safety. In this rare scenario, the game ends, and the kicking team is declared the winner, just as in the regular season.If the first team to possess the ball doesn’t score, or if the score is tied after both teams have had a possession, the game continues, and the next score—by any method (touchdown, field goal, or safety)—wins.Importantly, if a team scores a touchdown to win the game, extra points are not attempted, as the game ends immediately upon the score.Each team is allotted three timeouts per half (with two overtime periods counting as a half). This allows for strategic clock management during the extended play.There are no coach’s challenges in overtime.

Themay have a long-term master plan in the works, with an eye on signingin 2027 to create an unstoppable duo alongside. This bold strategy is gaining traction as the Lakers continue to build their roster around superstar talent and championship potential.Currently, the Los Angeles Lakers have a dominant pairing in Luka Doncic and LeBron James, with LeBron still performing at an MVP level, despite being 40 years old. Luka, at just 25, is expected to shoulder a lot of the burden for LeBron moving forward, which could give the 40-year-old forward the luxury of playing for a few more seasons. This arrangement not only secures the Lakers’ future, but it opens up the possibility for the team to remain competitive even after LeBron’s eventual retirement.When LeBron eventually steps away, the Los Angeles Lakers are setting themselves up to continue contending by bringing in another star player to complement Luka Doncic . That’s where Giannis Antetokounmpo enters the picture. The 32-year-old Milwaukee Bucks star has a player option for the 2027-28 season, and it’s possible that after a lengthy career in Milwaukee, he may seek a change of scenery if he feels his championship aspirations are better served elsewhere.says one expert, pointing out that the Los Angeles Lakers could be an ideal destination for the Greek Freak. His potential departure from the Bucks is especially likely if he fails to capture another title, even with the addition of Damian Lillard to the team. By 2027, Giannis Antetokounmpo may feel the time is right to move to a team with a better chance of securing a championship, such as the Lakers.The thought of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Luka Doncic teaming up would be a nightmare for opposing teams. Defensively, Giannis would cover many of the areas where Luka is still developing. Offensively, they would form one of the most dynamic duos in NBA history, with Giannis serving as an elite pick-and-roll threat alongside Luka, who is considered by many to be the greatest pick-and-roll passer of all time.Also read: NBA Trade Deadline News: Milwaukee Bucks land Kevin Porter Jr from Los Angeles Clippers in high-risk, high-reward move A team built around Luka Doncic and Giannis Antetokounmpo, with a solid supporting cast of floor-spacing shooters and defenders, could very well be the best in the league, and it’s a strategy that Los Angeles Lakers GM Rob Pelinka surely has on his radar as he looks to build a future dynasty.","Giannis Antetokounmpo has a player option for the 2027-28 season.

Theare eyeing a potential buyout acquisition to reinforce their backcourt and support their star-studded duo of Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler . With the Warriors recently adding Butler to the roster in a multi-team deal, they may look to bolster their guard depth after losing Dennis Schröder , who was valuable as a distributor and ball handler.The latest player to make waves on the buyout market is, a 34-year-old point guard who could be the perfect addition for Golden State. After winning an NBA championship with the Denver Nuggets in 2023, Jackson had a brief stint with the Philadelphia 76ers before being traded to the Washington Wizards. Shortly after the February 6 trade deadline, the Wizards waived Jackson, leaving the Golden State Warriors with a legitimate opportunity to sign him.As Clutch Points’ Brett Siegel highlighted,Reggie Jackson has previously played for several teams, including the Oklahoma City Thunder, Detroit Pistons , Los Angeles Clippers, and Nuggets, earning a reputation for his scoring ability and quickness to the rim as a primary ball handler.While Reggie Jackson may not return to his days with the Pistons, where he averaged 16.0 points per game, he brings valuable experience and leadership as a 14-year NBA veteran.

Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union first met at an event they were both hosting. It was a Super Bowl party back in 2007, and both were just coming out of a relationship at the time. Union had divorced her first husband, former NFL player Chris Howard, while Wade, on the other hand, had separated from his first wife, Siohvaughn Funches. Their divorce wasn't finalized until 2010, a year after Union and Wade would start dating.But all's well that ends well, and the couple has been together ever since, with a couple of hiccups so far.

And so, the day was very special.Which meant, Kaavia had to look her best for the special day. And that became a problem when she became adamant about having a red lip. As Union herself revealed later on the IPSY'S Hitting Pan podcast:""My husband got a statue and my child had a red lip and she’s not leaving until there’s a lip. Either we skip the whole thing entirely or let this child have a lip.""Finally, the parents thought it best to acquiesce to their daughter's demands, and the Wade family was on their way with Kaavia having gotten her red lip, a pink sequin dress, and a floral headband to celebrate her Daddy's big day.Every love story has its ups and downs, and the same was the case with D-Wade andactress. Their relationship started two years after they first met, as neither was ready to start something after having had some rough breakups. Then they split a couple of years into the relationship because of their busy careers, and Wade ended up fathering a child in the meantime. Thankfully, they solved their issues soon and were back together within the year.Then came another problem - the couple was married and trying for a child, but it wasn't easy for the actress. The doctors suggested surrogacy , but Union was not ready for that. But after multiple miscarriages, they decided that surrogacy was the best possible option for them. Thankfully, they now have a spritely little girl, who they love very much and who knows how to keep her parents alert and lively.Also Read: Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade: A Power Couple’s Combined Net Worth","Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union have a daughter, Kaavia, born via surrogate in 2018.

'ILT20 is great for UAE cricket': Sehwag anticipates thrilling finale

Team India Squad for ICC Men's Champions Trophy 2025

NEW DELHI: Jasprit Bumrah is all set to commence his rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru after he underwent scans and thorough assessment under the watch of Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) medical team. It is reliably learnt that the reports were internally discussed and now the seamer is likely to start physical activity - some gym work, even light bowling - in the next 24-48 hours.The International Cricket Council (ICC) deadline to make changes to Champions Trophy provisional squad is a couple of days away - February 11 midnight Dubai time as the support period starts February 12 - and it will not be a surprise if the Indian cricket board plays the waiting game with Bumrah. They followed a similar route even when Hardik Pandya was injured during the group stages of the 2023 ODI World Cup.""Even if there is a 1% chance, the BCCI is likely to wait. They did the same with Hardik Pandya as they waited for close to two weeks before getting Prasidh Krishna as a replacement. Even when Shubman Gill was down with dengue, they didn't have any thoughts of looking for a replacement. Yes those two incidents happened during the campaign but approach with Bumrah could well be no different. This is just the deadline to submit the squad and they could approach the Event Technical Committee at a later stage to seek a replacement if he fails to regain fitness,"" says a source close to developments.India's ace seamer was asked to off-load for five weeks after the Sydney Test vs Australia where he injured himself and didn't come out to bowl in the second innings. Since then, there has been no proper update from the BCCI on the nature and extent of his injury, and suspense around his return to competitive cricket has continued.Bumrah was named in the ODI squad for ongoing series vs England but his name was missing from the squad sheet when Varun Chakaravarthy was added to the set-up. With Harshit Rana already there and Varun added to the ODI squad, the Indian team management is clearly keeping the options ready if Bumrah doesn't get the all-clear from the NCA in time for the multi-nation tournament which starts on February 19.India captain Rohit Sharma had said that Varun, who even made his debut in the 2nd ODI, is also very much in contention.“Clearly during the series it presents us an opportunity to play him at some stage and see what he is capable of. Right now we are not thinking about whether we are going to take him or not but definitely he will be in contention. If things plan out really well for us and he does what is required then definitely there is something that we need to think about,” Rohit had said during the pre-series media interaction.Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill (vc), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja","Jasprit Bumrah is all set to commence his rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru.

Super Bowl rings aren’t just jewelry. They’re the ultimate flex in the NFL, a shiny reward for months of bruises, broken bones, and mind-numbing drills. Designed with diamonds, gold, and symbolism, these rings are status icons, bragging rights, and history all in one.Let’s take it back to January 15, 1967. The Green Bay Packers crushed the Kansas City Chiefs to win the very first Super Bowl. Their reward? A ring designed by Packers coach Vince Lombardi with Jostens. It had a clean, simple look—just a half-carat diamond in white gold. No over-the-top designs or endless bling like today.And that’s where it all began.But rings in sports weren’t new. Back in 1922, the New York Giants baseball team started the trend by choosing rings over traditional awards like pocket watches. The NFL eventually hopped on board after that first Super Bowl.These rings scream opulence. Yellow or rose gold? Check. Diamonds everywhere? Double check.Here’s the catch, though: every ring is different. The Los Angeles Rams put 20 carats of diamonds on their 2022 rings—a record. Some teams go all out with hundreds of tiny diamonds, while others go with larger stones.Mandatory features include:In 2010, the Green Bay Packers even ditched gold and used platinum for their rings.One thing’s for sure—the designs only get flashier every year.Believe it or not, the losing Super Bowl team also gets rings. No, they’re not as glitzy as the winner’s rings, but it’s still a ring. It honors their conference championship win (either AFC or NFC). Pity ring? Maybe. But you won’t see them throwing theirs away.Let’s talk money. A single ring costs between $30,000 and $50,000 to make. Yeah,Teams usually spend millions to cover everyone—players, coaches, staff, sometimes even the janitors. The NFL pitches in $5,000 per ring for the first 150 rings. But when you’re putting 14.8-carat diamonds on these things like the 2024 winners did, $5,000 doesn’t stretch far.Teams decide if they’ll pay the remaining costs or dock players' salaries. In 2023, Kansas City Chiefs players shelled out $11,000 each for their Super Bowl rings. But hey, that $157,000 Super Bowl bonus probably softened the blow.No one’s close to touching Tom Brady’s record. He owns seven Super Bowl rings—six with the New England Patriots and one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. His partnership with coach Bill Belichick wasdynasty of the 2000s and 2010s.The only player somewhat near his orbit? Charles Haley, who won five Super Bowl rings with the San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys.For context, the Pittsburgh Steelers’ entire legendary ‘70s roster—Terry Bradshaw, Franco Harris, Joe Greene, Lynn Swann, and others—each has four rings. Brady’s on a whole different level.Both teams have six Super Bowl victories. The Patriots’ dominance came under Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. The Steelers? They built a dynasty in the ‘70s under Chuck Noll, winning four titles in that decade alone.If you ever find a Super Bowl ring lying around (good luck with that), hold onto it—it’s a goldmine.Super Bowl rings are collector’s items, and some fans will drop millions to own a piece of NFL history.It depends on the team’s priorities. On average, 300 to 900 rings are made annually. The NFL provides funding for 150 rings, but teams often make extra for inactive players, support staff, and sometimes family members. The whole process—design to production—takes about four months.Some rings come with stories that live on in football folklore:Bill Belichick leads the pack with six rings as head coach of the New England Patriots.Chuck Noll won four with the Pittsburgh Steelers, while Bill Walsh and Joe Gibbs each have three. Andy Reid, coaching for the Kansas City Chiefs, now has three rings and is making a case for his spot among the all-time greats.","Super Bowl rings are the ultimate flex in the NFL, a shiny reward for months of bruises, broken bones, and mind-numbing drills.

Mekhi Becton Suffered a Knee Injury



Philadelphia Eagles star Mekhi Becton was quickly taken to the locker room after suffering a devastating knee injury in the first half of the Super Bowl. The team's starting right guard went down early in the highly anticipated matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday night. Shortly after, he was escorted to the locker room and officially listed as questionable to return.Becton's absence would be a significant setback for an Eagles offensive line that, through the first quarter of the Super Bowl, was performing at an elite level. This season, he played 903 snaps at right guard and finished as the 21st-ranked guard, according to Pro Football Focus. He also set career highs in both his PFF overall grade and run-blocking grade. In his first season with the Eagles—after spending three years with the Jets—Becton started all 15 games he played.Eagles starting offensive tackle Mekhi Becton is questionable to return after sustaining a knee injury. He was seen on the sideline attempting drills, visibly in pain. The injury occurred early in the second quarter, prompting an evaluation in the blue medical tent. In his absence, Tyler Steen has stepped in at right guard.The 25-year-old is in his first season with Philadelphia, having signed a one-year deal in April 2024. Now in his fifth NFL season, Becton was drafted 11th overall in the 2020 NFL Draft. Unfortunately, injuries have plagued his career. In 2021, he suffered a knee injury and was carted off the field, later diagnosed with cartilage damage that required surgery, sidelining him for 4–6 weeks.The following year, Becton sustained an avulsion fracture in his right kneecap, landing him on injured reserve and costing him the entire 2022 season. He remained healthy in 2023 but struggled in what became his final season with the Jets.Earlier this week, Becton was asked about the contrast between the Eagles and the Jets.""I would say that they're very confident. I would say that the Philly organization is very confident, they know what they're about to do, they know what they're gonna do, and they're gonna go do it,"" Becton said. Despite a turbulent tenure in New York filled with off-field drama, he chose to take the high road.","Mekhi Becton suffered a knee injury in the first half of the Super Bowl.

That's one that did not need to be called.""Tom Brady further emphasized his stance, stating, ""I always thought in these games you let the players play. It should be decided on the field. Don’t like that call to start the game.""The penalty, which negated a 32-yard gain, forced the Philadelphia Eagles to punt, effectively stalling their momentum and potentially altering the early trajectory of the game.

Super Bowl LIX Winner: Philadelphia Eagles Wins the Super Bowl 2025



Eagles fans are on the edge of their seats, watching the historic victory of the Philadelphia Eagles unfold. The current Super Bowl score stands at Eagles 40, Chiefs 22. Mahomes and his teammates gave it their all, but it seems fate had other plans, handing the win to Jalen Hurts and his team. Overall, the Eagles completely dominated the Chiefs.The Philadelphia Eagles triumphed in Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans, securing a dominant 40-22 victory over the two-time defending champions, the Kansas City Chiefs. This win allowed the Eagles to avenge their Super Bowl LVII loss to the Chiefs, marking their second Super Bowl championship.The match was thrilling, with the Eagles putting on an incredible performance against the Chiefs. Near the end, Mahomes connected with Worthy for a stunning 50-yard touchdown, followed by a two-point conversion with Hopkins. However, it was too late, and the Eagles emerged victorious in the 2025 Super Bowl.The 2024 season marked a step back for Jalen Hurts individually, following two consecutive Pro Bowl appearances, including a 2022 season where he finished as the MVP runner-up. The Eagles' offense leaned heavily on Saquon Barkley, making up for an inconsistent passing game and a less dynamic Hurts.However, it turns out Hurts was saving his best performance for the final stretch. Against a tough Chiefs defense that had slowed him down just enough two years ago (and had contained Barkley’s signature explosive runs tonight), Hurts delivered arguably his finest game of the season. He posted a solid 77.3 percent completion rate, going 17-of-22 for 221 yards and two touchdowns (with an ultimately inconsequential interception). On top of that, Hurts led the Eagles in rushing with 72 yards on 11 carries, averaging 6.5 yards per attempt.Two years ago, Hurts used the image of himself walking off the field amidst Chiefs-colored confetti as motivation to return to this stage. This time, he’ll finish the Super Bowl holding the Lombardi Trophy — and likely adding an MVP award to his collection.","The Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 in Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans.
