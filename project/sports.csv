He is very good at it and is a very shrewd tactician,"" Rathour, who played six Tests for India, added.""He spends a lot of time on the team's strategy. He is part of the bowlers' meeting, batters' meeting. He wants to sit with the bowlers and batters to try and understand what they are thinking. He invests a lot of time with the players.""Hailing Rohit as the players' captain, Rathour said that being a batsman with exceptional skills and consistency helps Rohit to lead by example and keep raising the bar for the rest of the team, especially batsmen.""His first quality is that as a batsman he is a phenomenal player. I think he is someone who understands his game really well. He always has a clear game plan,"" said Rathour.""Even as a leader, you will have to lead from the front, you have to perform to set the example; and since he has become the captain, he has always led by example.""Rathour said that while Rohit's on-field decisions have mostly been ""spot on"", some of those surprise you as a coach sitting in the dugout or inside the pavilion, and you only realise later that it was a master stroke.""His tactical decisions on the field are spot on. Sitting outside, it surprises you as a coach as well. We sometimes think what is he doing, but then you realise after a while what he has done,"" he said.Citing an example, Rathour mentioned one of Rohit's decisions during the T20 World Cup final earlier this year in June.""In the T20 World Cup final, he finished (Jasprit) Bumrah's overs early. A lot of people must have questioned the decision, but that decision put us in the situation where 16 (runs) were needed in the last over,"" said Rathour.India defeated South Africa by seven runs to lift their second T20 World Cup trophy.","Rohit Sharma has been praised by former India opener Vikram Rathour.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh's preparations for the upcoming two-Test series against Pakistan have been severely disrupted by the political unrest that has engulfed the nation. The foreign coaches of the team were confined to their residences, strictly adhering to the advisories issued by their respective embassies, while widespread protests prevented the team from gathering for training sessions.The composition of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) is also uncertain, following the departure of president Nazmul Hassan from the country due to his ties with the ousted prime minister, Sheikh Hasina.Despite the political upheaval, star allrounder Shakib Al Hasan , who served as a member of parliament for Hasina's party, has been permitted to participate in the Pakistan series by the interim government.""Because of the situation it was not possible to practice,"" spin bowling coach Mushtaq Ahmed told reporters.The Pakistan Cricket Board offered some relief to the visiting team by inviting them to arrive four days earlier to compensate for their lack of preparation.A second-string Bangladesh team, including six players from the national squad, had already been participating in practice matches in Islamabad since August 10.Further compounding Bangladesh's challenges, in-form opener Mahmudul Hasan Joy has been sidelined from the first Test due to a groin injury, although senior batter Mushfiqur Rahim is expected to recover from a finger injury in time for the match.Bangladesh will be determined to break their winless streak against Pakistan, having suffered defeats in 12 out of the 13 Tests played between the two nations, with only one draw. The two-match Test series is part of the third cycle of the World Test Championship , with Pakistan currently occupying the sixth position in the nine-team table, while Bangladesh sits in eighth place.The second Test, originally scheduled to be held in Karachi, has been relocated to Rawalpindi due to ongoing construction work at the Karachi stadium and will commence on August 30.Following a 3-0 defeat in Australia earlier this year, Pakistan has brought in former Australian paceman Jason Gillespie as their Test coach and hired Adelaide groundsman Damien Hough to improve the quality of their pitches. Pakistan is expected to field an all-pace attack for the first Test, a strategy they last employed five years ago against Sri Lanka at the same venue.In contrast, Bangladesh will heavily rely on their spin trio of Shakib Al Hasan (237 wickets), Taijul Islam (195 wickets), and Mehidy Hasan Miraz (164 wickets).Pakistan captain Shan Masood dismissed the notion that the Bangladesh team is underprepared, stating, ""You expect all international Test sides to come into a series well prepared and trying to play their best cricket.""Masood also expressed optimism about Pakistan's potential improvement under the guidance of their new coaching staff, saying, ""We are excited to see how they (coaches) help us to be better people, better cricketers and -- most importantly -- be among the top teams in the world.""Pakistan vs Bangladesh 1st Test match will be played from Wednesday, August 21 to August 25.Pakistan vs Bangladesh 1st Test match will be played at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium in Rawalpindi.Pakistan vs Bangladesh 1st Test live streaming will not be done in India.The upcoming Test series between Pakistan and Bangladesh will not be aired on any television channel. Indian viewers will be unable to watch the live telecast of the first Test match between the two nations on their TV sets, as no broadcaster holds the rights to televise the series.Cricket fans in India need not worry about missing out on the excitement of the game, despite the absence of a television broadcast deal.

Mayank Yadav: Remember Mayank Yadav? Former India bowling coach feels BCCI 'can't wrap the pacer up in cotton wool',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/remember-mayank-yadav-former-india-bowling-coach-feels-bcci-cant-wrap-the-pacer-up-in-cotton-wool/articleshow/112667918.cms,"Mayank Yadav (TOI Photo)

NEW DELHI: Mayank Yadav , the promising 22-year-old fast bowler for Lucknow Super Giants , emerged as one of the standout players in IPL 2024 , impressing with his sheer pace and taking seven wickets in just four games. However, his season was abruptly halted due to injury, leading to uncertainty about his return to competitive cricket.BCCI secretary Jay Shah expressed doubts about Yadav's availability for the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Test series scheduled for December.While recovering at the National Cricket Academy (NCA), former India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey insists on easing Yadav back into action, particularly focusing on first-class cricket.Yadav's blistering speed captured attention early in the IPL 2024 season, consistently bowling at speeds exceeding 150 kmph, and delivering the fourth fastest ball in IPL history at 156.7 kmph. Unfortunately, an injury curtailed his participation after just four games where he secured seven wickets.""I cannot give you any answer on Mayank Yadav as there is no guarantee whether he will be in the team or not. But he is potentially a good fast bowler, and we are looking after him. He is currently at the NCA,"" Shah told The Times of India last week.The concerns around Yadav's injury have sparked discussions about his immediate future and the appropriate path for his recovery. Former India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey advocates for a gradual reintroduction to competitive cricket, particularly in the longer format. Mhambrey argues that keeping Yadav sidelined out of caution may not be the best approach for the young pacer.""I don't agree that if he is not ready, just don't play him. This is the age where he has to bowl. A bowler should bowl. The more you bowl, the more you will have control, you will know your threshold as to how much your body can take. You can't wrap him up in cotton wool saying he will get injured,"" Mhambrey told The Indian Express in an interview.Mhambrey believes that Yadav's development and injury management would benefit from playing red-ball cricket. He emphasized that first-class cricket is crucial for gaining the necessary experience and for understanding individual physical limits.""We can't overbowl and burn him out, but we have to be smart about how much he should bowl. As a fast bowler, he needs to play first-class cricket,"" Mhambrey said.He stressed the importance of studying Yadav's background and training regimen to better manage his fitness and workload.""You have to check his background. How much cricket has he played? How much has he bowled? Everything adds up. We need to go in depth about him, what have been his training methods? How many overs he used to bowl, his history of injuries,"" Mhambrey noted.Mhambrey also highlighted the significance of understanding that Yadav is still in the developmental phase of his career, and proactive management of his workload and fitness is crucial.""He's only 22. His body is still developing. He is in that injury-prone age group. His body has not completely developed yet. His injuries can be controlled if we understand his background well.""As the BCCI deliberates on the best course of action for Yadav, the young pacer's return to full fitness remains eagerly anticipated by fans and selectors alike. His impressive performances in the IPL have shown glimpses of his potential, and managing his recovery effectively could be key to his future success in Indian cricket.","Mayank Yadav was one of the standout players in IPL 2024.

And when you talk to opposition batsmen about him (Bumrah) in particular, it's always, 'No, he's a nightmare!

He's getting better year on year. He would rank right up there.""When you've got that skillset and the consistency that he has, then you're going to be a great player.

In an interview last month, Bumrah expressed his belief that fast bowlers could make excellent captains, citing the successful captaincies of Kapil Dev and Imran Khan , who led India and Pakistan to World Cup victories, respectively.However, Basit Ali, in a video on his YouTube channel, disagreed with Bumrah's perspective. He emphasized that both Dev and Khan were appointed as captains only after they had established themselves as all-rounders, not just bowlers.""About Jasprit Bumrah's statement, it's just like how Babar Azam likes captaincy. In my opinion, he should not chase captaincy. He is a top-class bowler and should be focusing just on that,"" Basit said.Basit further clarified the distinction between a bowler and an all-rounder when it comes to leadership roles, stating, ""He gave the examples of Kapil Dev and Imran Khan's captaincy. However, they had become all-rounders, which is why they succeeded as captains. They were not appointed captains when they came into their teams as bowlers. This is the difference between a bowler and an all-rounder.""While acknowledging the success of Australian pacerPat Cummins as a captain, Basit pointed out that there are very few fast bowlers who have thrived in the role of a captain or coach.""He also spoke about Pat Cummins. Yes, Cummins is a good captain, but there are very few fast bowlers who can become a good coach or captain. My best wishes to Jasprit Bumrah. There is a chance that he could be made the captain after the Champions Trophy,"" Basit added.Bumrah has previously led India as a stand-in captain during the one-off Test against England at Edgbaston in 2022 and also captained India to a 2-0 victory in a three-match T20I series against Ireland last year.","Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has responded to Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah's comments regarding the lack of opportunities for pace bowlers in leadership roles.

However, East Delhi Riders, propelled by Rawat's late blitz, chased down the target in 16 overs.Purani Dilli 6's innings got off to a shaky start as they lost wickets at regular intervals. East Delhi Riders' bowlers, led by Simranjeet Singh (3 for 27) and Mayank Rawat, kept a tight leash on the scoring rate. Singh struck early, dismissing Arpit Rana leg-before-wicket in the second over. He continued his impressive spell by removing Manjeet and Keshav Dalal in quick succession.Rawat joined the party in the fifth over, claiming the crucial wickets of Sanat Sangwan and skipper Lalit Yadav. Harsh Tyagi further dented Purani Dilli 6's innings with two wickets in the ninth over.Despite the early setbacks, a crucial 70-run partnership between Yug Gupta (34 not out) and Mayank Gusain (35) rescued Purani Dilli 6 from a precarious position. Their partnership enabled the team to post a respectable total.In pursuit of 143, East Delhi Riders faced early hiccups.

It was almost perfect that night.Kolkata, 2001, when VVS (Laxman) and (Rahul) Dravid batted all day. They just shut us out of the game. When I reflect on it, you almost knew you were part of something special.Captaincy brings different pressures and expectations. Also, an element of excitement that you can have such an impact on the game. There are tough days, there are challenging days and then there are pleasing days.

The Serbian forward was puzzled by the decision, but Cambiaso's offside position earlier in the play negated the goal.Under Motta's guidance, Juve's playing style has become more attractive compared to the previous manager, Massimiliano Allegri. This transformation is ongoing, with some of Allegri's preferred players, such as Federico Chiesa, being benched to accommodate those better suited to Motta's approach.Como will have a clearer understanding of their chances of remaining in the division after their upcoming matches against Cagliari and Udinese. The ambitious club, managed by Cesc Fabregas, was outmatched on the night.""Today was a reality check. We need to be better,"" said Fabregas to DAZN.""What I sure was a difference in quality... They were devastating when they took the ball off us and we gave away too many easy balls. That's not tactics, that's down to individual quality.""Marco Brescianini and Mateo Retegui, recent acquisitions for Atalanta, delivered a remarkable debut performance in their match against Lecce. The Europa League champions have faced a challenging summer, dealing with significant injuries and players pushing for transfers.Brescianini, who joined from Frosinone just days prior, scored the opening goal by capitalizing on a rebound in the 35th minute. He later sealed the victory with a composed finish in the 66th minute, making it 4-0.Between Brescianini's goals, Italian forward Retegui showcased his prowess by scoring a powerful header just before half-time. He then earned and successfully converted a penalty kick shortly before the hour mark, contributing to Atalanta's dominant away display.""It's better than even I could have imagined,"" said Brescianini, who is from just outside Bergamo, where Atalanta are based. ""I'm really happy to be wearing this jersey and I hope to repay the faith the club and fans have shown in me.""Atalanta's squad has been severely impacted by injuries, with key players Gianluca Scamacca and Giorgio Scalvini among those currently unavailable. The team is also dealing with the absence of several other players due to various fitness issues.In addition to the injury woes, head coach Gian Piero Gasperini had to make tough decisions regarding his lineup. Teun Koopmeiners and Ademola Lookman, the latter of whom scored a memorable hat-trick in the Europa League final, were both omitted from the squad as they seek transfers before the window closes.""No-one expected to be in this situation,"" Gasperini told Sky Sport. ""I have to play it by ear right now... I don't know what's going to happen in the coming 10 days but our job is to build as much as we can.""Atalanta CEO Luca Percassi has suggested that the club may still be able to resolve the situation with the two players who have expressed their desire to leave, despite the imminent start of the match.Reports indicate that Paris Saint-Germain is keen on acquiring the services of Nigerian attacker Lookman.""Our idea is that for the first time in our history to not let our big players go,"" Percassi told Sky Sport.

This decision follows a hearing held on August 15th, where evidence and testimonies were presented.Sinner, who achieved a career-high ranking of world No. 1 in June 2023, provided an explanation for the positive tests.He claimed that a member of his support team unknowingly used an over-the-counter spray containing Clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid, to treat a minor wound on Sinner. The same team member subsequently administered massages to Sinner, inadvertently leading to the contamination.The ITIA, after reviewing the evidence and accepting Sinner's explanation, concluded that the violation lacked intent.This determination, supported by the independent tribunal's findings, resulted in a ""No Fault or Negligence"" ruling, effectively clearing Sinner of intentional doping charges.The incident occurred during the Indian Wells tournament, where Sinner initially tested positive for low levels of Clostebol metabolites.A second positive test from an out-of-competition sample collected eight days later led to a provisional suspension, which was later lifted following Sinner's successful appeal.Despite the investigation and its impact on his Indian Wells results, Sinner has continued to excel on the court.

This marks the first time either player has won the title at the prestigious tournament.In the women's final, Sabalenka triumphed over Jessica Pegula 6-3, 7-5, claiming her first title since her victory at the Australian Open earlier this year in January.Sinner, who celebrated his 23rd birthday on Friday, defeated American player Frances Tiafoe 7-6 (4), 6-2. With this win, Sinner becomes the youngest champion at the Cincinnati Open since Andy Murray's victory in 2008 at the age of 21.“I’m very happy to be in the position where I am,"" Sinner said, as quoted by AP. ""I'm just trying to keep going this way mentally. It's important to recover to be ready for New York. That's the most important thing.”The US Open is set to commence on August 26 in New York City.In Cincinnati, Sinner and Tiafoe both reached their maiden finals, surpassing their previous best performances of reaching the third round.Despite Tiafoe's efforts to force a tiebreak in the opening set, a series of three consecutive errors resulted in a 7-6 loss.Sinner established a commanding 5-1 lead in the second set, but Tiafoe managed to save three match points, narrowing the gap to 5-2. However, Sinner ultimately prevailed, successfully serving out the match to secure the victory.Tiafoe's journey to the final was marked by unusual circumstances. In the quarterfinals on Saturday, he claimed the first set before his opponent, Hubert Hurkacz, retired due to a calf injury. Subsequently, in the semifinals, Tiafoe showcased his resilience by saving two match points and defeating Holger Rune in a thrilling three-set encounter.An American male tennis player hasn't secured the championship in Cincinnati since 2006, when Andy Roddick achieved the feat.Sabalenka, who climbed to the No. 2 position in the rankings prior to the match, showcased her dominance by winning the tournament without dropping a single set.

The Belarusian player was forced to miss Wimbledon due to a shoulder injury but made her return to the tour two weeks ago in Washington.“I would say that I'm really playing great tennis,” Sabalenka said. “Probably not the best tennis I can play but I'm definitely getting there. Hopefully at the US Open I can reach even higher levels.”Sabalenka quickly established a commanding 4-1 lead in the opening set against Pegula, taking just 17 minutes to assert her dominance. Despite Pegula's efforts to mount a comeback, including breaking Sabalenka's serve for the first time to level the second set at 5-5, her five double faults proved costly.Sabalenka, however, remained focused and determined, claiming the next two games to secure victory in a match that lasted 1 hour and 14 minutes.“She was playing at a high level and never really came down,” Pegula said. “When she’s serving really well, it’s tough, especially on these fast courts.”Pegula, the sixth-ranked player, faced a tough journey to reach the final. Following her successful title defense in Toronto, the American had to play two matches on Friday due to delays caused by weather conditions. Additionally, three of her matches extended to three sets.“I'm proving to myself that I can play a lot of matches and overcome a lot of challenges,” Pegula said. “I'm looking forward to not doing anything for a few days.""Sabalenka joined top-ranked Iga Swiatek as the only players with 10 or more WTA titles since 2020.

Maharashtra government

to make amends & announce reward to boost shuttler's morale before Paris Games

MUMBAI: Badminton player Chirag Shetty 's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements while rewarding cricketers from the state for winning the T20 World Cup have stirred up a hornet's nest.Chirag along with Satwiksairaj Rankireddy - the No.3 ranked men's doubles team in the world - played a crucial role in India winning their maiden Thomas Cup in 2022. Chirag, though, wasn't recognised for his effort. After seeing the cricketers being feted, the aggrieved shuttler told TOI on Sunday that ""if the state government can honour World Cup-winning stars, they should also honour him and treat other sports equally"".Besides the Thomas Cup success, Chirag has also won doubles gold at Asian Games , Commonwealth Games and bronze at World Championships. The 27-year-old Malad resident has now found support from prominent sportspersons of the city, who urged the state government to resurrect the situation by rewarding Chirag. Uday Pawar , coach and mentor of Chirag, felt that his ward's achievement is on par with that of cricketers and he should have been rewarded for it.Former India hockey captain MM Somaya said that he had sympathy for Chirag as ""winning the Thomas Cup is a truly historic achievement"". He went on to add that the state government can make amends by announcing a reward for him just before the Paris Olympics begin which will be good ""for his morale as well"".Pawar, a former Asian Games medallist and a prominent badminton coach in the city, said: ""I am not comparing sports but like the cricketers who have brought honour to Maharashtra, so has Chirag. I feel his achievement is on par (with the cricketers). A person who has brought honour to the state shouldn't be demanding but the state should recognise his efforts on its own.""He added that players shouldn't ask for recognition and instead the state government should have a mechanism in place where once they have achieved something of national significance, they should be rewarded.""I think the state's sports ministry should be more active. They should do their own homework and should be aware of who the top players from Maharashtra are. If they don't know about his/her achievement, then the ministry is not functioning properly. They should have people who will keep in touch with the respective associations from state and take updates on how their players are performing,"" said Pawar.Somaya said: ""I would fully agree with Chirag and I would quite understand his position. Since he was the only player from Maharashtra, he deserves the recognition. Need not be such a huge amount that they have given to cricketers but in some manner, he should be rewarded. He is seeking recognition from the state government which I think is only natural and I think it will be fair even if the state govt does it now. He is one of the key players from Maharashtra to participate in the Olympics and has a good chance of winning a medal with Satwik.""He also urged the state government to have a ""consistent policy"" to reward the performers from other sports as well. ""They should reward the players as soon as they know that someone from the state has achieved something big. It should be a standard process. A person shouldn't be applying for it. You should make a person feel a sense of pride when a state government recognises a player on their own,"" felt Somaya.","Badminton player Chirag Shetty's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements have stirred up a hornet's nest.
