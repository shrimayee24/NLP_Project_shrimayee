NEW DELHI: The upcoming clash between Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Punjab Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL) pits two teams against each other, each fighting for survival in the tournament. RCB , after a dismal start, has mounted a remarkable comeback, securing three consecutive victories and climbing to the seventh spot in the IPL 2024 points table . Despite their resurgence, their path to the playoffs remains challenging, as they need to win all their remaining three fixtures to stand a chance.Similarly, Punjab Kings find themselves in a precarious position, occupying the eighth spot with the same number of points as RCB.With both teams vying for a spot in the playoffs, the upcoming match holds significant importance. Only one team can potentially reach the crucial 14-point mark, and RCB, buoyed by their recent wins and a previous victory against Punjab Kings, enter the contest with a sense of confidence.Also see: IPL live score Punjab Kings holds a marginally better head-to-head record against RCB in their IPL encounters, winning 17 out of 32 matches compared to RCB's 15 victories. However, RCB turned the tables in their most recent clash this season, powered by Virat Kohli 's 77 and Dinesh Karthik's explosive 28* off just 10 balls.Also see: IPL match result Moving to the venue, the HPCA Stadium in Dharamshala has hosted 12 IPL matches since March 2010. Known for its bounce-friendly pitches favoring fast bowlers and providing ample opportunities for batsmen, the average first innings total stands at a high-scoring 179. However, in the recent match between CSK and Punjab Kings, CSK managed 167 runs in their innings. Spinners took center stage in that game, with Rahul Chahar and Ravindra Jadeja both bagging impactful three-wicket hauls.In IPL 2024, the HPCA Stadium has hosted one match so far. In this solitary match, the team batting first emerged victorious, while no team managed to chase successfully. The average first innings total in this season stands at 167 runs, while the average second innings total is 139 runs. The highest total recorded at the venue was 167/9 by Chennai Super Kings against Punjab Kings, whereas the lowest total was 139/9 by Punjab Kings against Chennai Super Kings. These stats suggest that the pitch at the HPCA Stadium in IPL 2024 has favoured the team batting first.Considering the recent trends, spinners are likely to play a crucial role in the upcoming clash. Captains from both teams may opt to include at least two specialist spinners in their playing XI. Additionally, a strong batting line up will be crucial given the historically high-scoring nature of the pitch at Dharamshala.Virat Kohli has been in scintillating form, currently holding the IPL 2024 Orange Cap with 542 runs in 11 innings. His last encounter with Punjab Kings saw him scoring a brilliant 77 runs, undoubtedly boosting his confidence ahead of facing them again.He has been impressive, amassing 315 runs in 11 matches. Notably, he has played crucial innings in two 60-plus scores, both resulting in successful 200-plus run-chases for Punjab Kings. His quickfire knocks of 61* off 29 balls against Gujarat Titans and 68* off 28 balls against KKR were instrumental in his team's victories.He has been a standout performer, claiming 17 wickets in 11 matches in IPL 2024. He has already secured three three-wicket hauls this season, placing him second in the race for the IPL 2024 Purple Cap . Patel's consistent performances have been vital for Punjab Kings, bolstering their bowling attack and contributing significantly to their campaign.Sam Curran (c), Matthew Short, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Prabhsimran Singh (wk), Jitesh Sharma (wk), Sikandar Raza, Rishi Dhawan, Liam Livingstone, Atharva Taide, Arshdeep Singh, Nathan Ellis, Kagiso Rabada, Harpreet Brar, Rahul Chahar, Harpreet Bhatia, Vidwath Kaverappa, Shivam Singh, Harshal Patel, Chris Woakes, Ashutosh Sharma, Vishwanath Pratap Singh, Shashank Singh, Tanay Thyagarajan, Prince Choudhary, Rilee Rossouw.Faf du Plessis (c), Glenn Maxwell, Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar, Anuj Rawat, Dinesh Karthik, Suyash Prabhudessai, Will Jacks, Mahipal Lomror, Karn Sharma, Manoj Bhandage, Mayank Dagar, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Akash Deep, Mohammed Siraj, Reece Topley, Himanshu Sharma, Rajan Kumar, Cameron Green, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Tom Curran, Lockie Ferguson, Swapnil Singh, Saurav Chauhan.Dinesh Karthik, Jonny BairstowVirat Kohli, Faf du Plessis, Shashank Singh: Sam Curran, Cameron Green, Will JacksHarshal Patel, Rahul Chahar, Mohammed Siraj","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Punjab Kings face each other in IPL 2024.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals captain Sanju Samson's valiant effort of 86 runs off 46 balls, which included six sixes and eight boundaries, was not enough to secure a victory against Delhi Capitals. Nevertheless, Mukesh Kumar and Kuldeep Yadav have re-entered the race for the IPL 2024 purple cap.His dismissal in the 16th over, which sparked controversy due to a close call on the boundary line, led to Rajasthan finishing at 201-8, suffering their third loss of the season.Despite the defeat, Rajasthan Royals remain in second place on the points table with 16 points, behind leaders Kolkata Knight Riders on net run-rate. Delhi Capitals, with 12 points, are now tied with three other teams - Chennai Super Kings, Sunrisers Hyderabad, and Lucknow Super Giants - as the race for the playoffs intensifies.The turning point of the match came when Shai Hope took a brilliant catch on the edge of the boundary at long-on to dismiss Samson. The Rajasthan captain exchanged words with the on-field umpires after the television umpire, Michael Gough, declared him out, as replays from one angle suggested that Hope might have touched the boundary line.Following Samson's dismissal, Rajasthan's run-chase faltered, losing five wickets for just 39 runs, with left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav (2-25) striking twice in one over to seal the game for the home team.In the Purple Cap tally, Mukesh Kumar and Kuldeep Yadav have re-entered the top 10 after their impressive performances in Delhi Capitals' win over Rajasthan Royals. Mukesh currently occupies the sixth position with 15 wickets in eight matches, while Kuldeep, with 14 wickets, takes the eighth spot in the bowlers' leaderboard.SEE ALSO: IPL 2024 Orange Cap Standings Jasprit Bumrah continues to lead the Purple Cap table with 18 wickets in 12 matches, despite taking only one wicket against Sunrisers Hyderabad. Harshal Patel of Punjab Kings and KKR's Varun Chakaravarthy follow closely behind with 17 and 16 wickets, respectively.T Natarajan of Sunrisers Hyderabad has slipped from the top-three to fourth position with 15 wickets, while Arshdeep Singh of Punjab Kings rounds out the top five with 15 wickets as well.",The IPL Purple Cap 2024 will be the largest in the history of the Indian Premier League. The cap will be worth a total of $1.2 billion. It is the largest cap in the league's history. It will also be the most expensive in the world.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109940827,imgsize-31764,width-400,resizemode-4/109940827.jpg"

How we calculate the chances

With 13 games left to be played in the league stage of IPL 2024, there remain nearly 8,200 possible combinations of match results. No one is yet certain of making the playoffs, but one team ( MI ) is totally ruled out. We look at the chances of each team:The team currently topping the table have a 36% chance of finishing the sole toppers and they could do that even with just one win from their remaining three games.Their chances of finishing joint toppers on points are an impressive 62.5%. Yet, they are still not sure of making the playoffs. If they lose all their remaining games, they could end up tied fourth with DC or LSG depending on results in other games. But there's just a 0.2% chance of such a scenarioLike KKR, they have a 36% chance of being sole toppers at the end of the league phase and a 62.5% chance of being at least tied for the first spot on points. Yet, they too are still not sure of making the playoffs. If they lose all their remaining games, they could end up tied fourth with DC or LSG depending on results in other games. But there's just a 0.4% chance of such a scenarioWednesday's thumping win over LSG moved SRH up to third on the table and improved their chances of making it to the top four singly or jointly from 72% to nearly 94%. The best they can hope for is a joint first spot with one to three other teams and the chances of that are a little under 5%Currently in third place, CSK have a little over 73% chance of finishing within the top four slots either singly or jointly. Like SRH, the best they can do is tied for top spot with one to three other teams. And the chances of that are a mere 4%.Lying in fifth place at the moment, DC have no chance of finishing the toppers or even joint toppers. Their chances of ending up among the top four singly or jointly are just under 50%. Their best case scenario is joint second on points and there's a little under 4% chance of that happeningDespite Wednesday's rout, LSG remain in sixth place. But their chances of making the top four singly or jointly dropped from 70% to just under 50%. Like DC, the best they can do is tie for the second spot with one to three other teams. The chances of that happening are just under 4%Seventh-placed RCB can hope for not better than tied third or fourth and the chances of even that are just over 8%Punjab too can at best hope for tied third or fourth and the chances of that are just over 6%The title holders find themselves at the bottom of the table and their chances of progressing are slim at a little under 8%Currently ninth, but MI are now definitely out of the playoffs. None of the 8,192 possible combinations of match results can end up with them finishing better than 5th on points.Bet on KKR and RR making the playoffs to be joined by two out of CSK, SRH, LSG and DC, with the first two having a distinctly better chance. For any of the others to get into the mix would need a miracle.With 13 games remaining, there remain 8,192 possible combinations of match outcomes. We look at each one of those and what it would mean in terms of the final rankings of the teams. Then we work out the percentage of outcomes that would give team ""A"" a chance of finishing in the top four, or the first spot and so on. The underlying assumption is that any given match is a 50-50 game, not unreasonable given how the IPL has unfolded this year and in other years. For instance, of the 8,192 combinations, RR finish leaders singly or jointly in 5,120 combinations, which means a 62.5% chance of making the top spot singly or jointly.","With 13 games remaining, there remain nearly 8,200 possible combinations of match results.

Virat Kohli always wants to be in the thick of things when it comes to action on the cricket field, and Thursday was no different. First he played a sensational innings and then produced a 'Superman' moment on the field with a run-out off a direct hit in Royal Challengers Bengaluru's (RCB) big win over Punjab Kings at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala .Coming out to bat in his customary opening position for RCB, Kohli's bat sparkled to produced 92 runs off just 47 balls, including 6 sixes and 7 fours, which powered RCB to a mammoth 241 for 7, as Rajat Patidar (55 off 23 balls) and Cameron Green (46 off 27 balls) kept the momentum in the middle overs and towards the end.Kohli, however, had a lucky day on the crease as he was dropped twice -- on 0 and 10.Orange Cap-holder Kohli now has 634 runs in 12 innings, becoming only the second batsman after KL Rahul to score 600-plus runs in four IPL seasons.For Punjab, Harshal Patel led the bowling charts with his spell of 3/38, which also earned him the Purple Cap. His tally of wickets now tops the charts with 20 wickets in 12 innings.Punjab's run-chase folded up in 17 overs at 181 all out despite Rilee Rossouw's commendable knock of 61 off just 27 balls. The RCB bowling effort was led by Mohammed Siraj's 3 for 43. Swapnil Singh, Lockie Ferguson and Karn Sharma took two wickets each.The chase also saw a moment of brilliance in the field by Kohli when he ran out Shashank Singh , who scored a pacy 37 off just 19 balls.The delivery after Shashank's nasty collision with RCB skipper Faf du Plessis in the 14th over, the Punjab batsman played Lockie Ferguson towards the leg-side and tried to steal a second run as Kohli ran in from deep mid-wicket, picked up the ball one-handed and threw the stumps down in the same motion with a direct hit to celebrate straight away.The third-umpire found Shashank's bat short of the popping crase on replay and declared the batsman out.It was RCB's fourth straight win and fifth in total, which took them to 10 points and kept their faint playoff hopes alive.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Punjab Kings by five wickets in IPL.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli and Rajat Patidar delivered impressive fifties before the bowlers shone, helping Royal Challengers Bengaluru keep their playoff hopes alive with a dominant 60-run victory over Punjab Kings in the IPL on Thursday.Kohli's 47-ball 92 was the foundation of RCB's innings, as he excelled in two partnerships: 72 runs off 32 balls with Patidar (55 off 23 balls) and 92 runs off 46 balls with Cameron Green (46 off 27 balls), propelling RCB to 241/7.In response, Rilee Rossouw dazzled with a 27-ball 61, but Karn Sharma's twin breakthroughs sparked a collapse as PBKS were bowled out for 181 in 17 overs.This marked RCB's fourth consecutive win, bringing them to 10 points, while PBKS were eliminated from the playoff race with 8 points, as they can only reach a maximum of 12 points from their remaining two games.Swapnil Singh (2/28), Karn (2/36) and Lockie Ferguson (2/29) took two each, while Mohammed Siraj (3/43) claimed three wickets for RCB.Chasing a stiff target, PBKS lost Prabhsimran Singh (6) early but Rossouw looked unstoppable as left-arm spinner Swapnil Singh was carted for two fours before Siraj was belted for three fours and a six.Yash Dayal and Ferguson were then hit for 16 and 14 runs by Jonny Bairstow (27) and Rossouw as PBKS scored 75 runs in six overs.Once Bairstow was removed by Ferguson, Rossouw turned his attention on Green, blasting two fours and a six on way to his fifty off 21 balls.Jitesh Sharma was then cleaned up by Karn, while Swapnil got rid of Liam Livingstone (0) as Punjab slipped to 126 for 5 in 12th over.They couldn't recover from those blows and it was all over when Shashank Singh (37), Sam Curran (22) and Ashutosh Sharma (8) returned to the dugout.Earlier, Kohli, who was dropped on 0 and 10, timed the ball nicely, used his feet and wrists to bring up his sixth IPL fifty this season. He reached his mark in 32 balls, before slamming another 40 in his next 15 balls. He cracked seven fours and six maximums.Patidar, who was also given two lives, provided the early momentum as he slammed six maximums and three fours during his 23-ball 55.After Patidar's dismissal, Kohli and Green continued the onslaught to take RCB past the 200-mark. Green hit five fours and a six before being caught in the final ball as RCB scored 77 in last five overs.Pacer Vidhwath Kaverappa (2/36) picked up two wickets in the powerplay on his IPL debut but his figures could have been much better had the fielders not dropped three catches off his bowling.Kohli was dropped in the third ball but Kaverappa dismissed Faf du Plessis (9) and removed Will Jacks (12) but PBKS couldn't create pressure as Sam Curran (1/50) and Harshal Patel (3/38) leaked runs.Patel, who had dropped Patidar, conceded three boundaries in his first over as RCB scored 56 in the powerplay.It started raining sixes thereafter as Kohli and Patidar slammed a maximum each to spoil Kaverappa's bowling figures.Patidar then creamed spinner Rahul Chahar for three mighty maximums before depositing Arshdeep and Sam Curran for two more sixes, the last one bringing up his fifty in 21 balls.With Patidar on fire, RCB crossed 100 in the ninth over. Curran, however, got rid of Patidar in the 10th over, when rain halted play for a brief while.After resumption, Kohli completed his fifty and hit Livingstone for two fours.Green brought up the 150 with a four off Patel. Kohli then went berserk as he slog swept Livingstone for a six, while Curran was deposited over mid-wicket for a 94-metre maximum. He sent one over long-on for another maximum.Dinesh Karthik (18) played a cameo before Patel claimed three wickets in last over.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Punjab Kings by 60 runs in IPL.

Punjab could have dismissed Kohli without scoring and then on 10, but missed both the opportunities and the RCB opener sparkled to produced 92 runs off just 47 balls, including 6 sixes and 7 fours.

Kohli's knock powered RCB to a mammoth 241 for 7, as Rajat Patidar (55 off 23 balls) and Cameron Green (46 off 27 balls) kept the momentum in the middle overs and towards the end. The RCB bowlers, led by Mohammed Siraj's 3 for 43, then bowled out Punjab for 181 to complete a 60-run triumph.

Swapnil Singh, Lockie Ferguson and Karn Sharma took two wickets each.

After the win, 'Player of the Match' Kohli explained how he has re-introduced the slog-sweep in his game to counter spinners -- something he did against Gujarat Titans' spinners, before using it against Punjab's Rahul Chahar and Liam Livingstone on Thursday.

""I brought out the slog-sweep against the spinners. I didn't practice it, I know I can hit it as I have done in the past.

I am always looking to expose that side of the field against spin. I know I need to take risks, it needs a bit of conviction. I have been managing to stay ahead of that thought and trying to keep up with the strike rate for me and the team,"" said Kohli at the post-match presentation ceremony.

Orange Cap-holder Kohli now has 634 runs in 12 innings, becoming only the second batsman after KL Rahul to score 600-plus runs in four IPL seasons.

Kohli's strike rate, which is 153.51 after 12 innings so far in this IPL season, had been questioned earlier. Hinting towards that, Kohli remarked that for him it's ""still quality over quantity'.

""Still quality over quantity, more so at this stage of my career. Understading your game over so many years allows you to practise but still stay switched on and still aiming to improve aspects of your game that you want to get better on,"" he said.

The win, which is RCB's fourth in a row, took their points tally to 10, which means their faint hopes of reaching the playoffs stay alive.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Punjab by 60 runs in IPL.

WATCH VIDEO OF GOENKA TALKING TO RAHUL AFTER THE MATCH

After Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) got hammered by Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in an unbelievable run-chase pulled off by Hyderabad openers Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head, Lucknow skipper KL Rahul found himself at the receiving end of an animated discussion with franchise's owner Sanjiv Goenka near the LSG dugout but maintained his calm.Chasing LSG's below-par 165 for 4, Hyderabad openers launched an almost unreal attack on Lucknow bowlers to reach the target in a mere 9.4 overs and register a massive 10-wicket win.Hitting 14 sixes and 16 fours collectively, Head and Abhihsek smashed 89* off just 30 balls and 75* off only 28 balls, respectively.Before being clueless against SRH's attack as a captain, Rahul had a forgettable outing as a batsman, scoring 29 off 33 balls. It was only because of Nicholas Pooran's 48* off 26 balls and Ayush Badoni's 55* off 30 that LSG could put up a competitive total on the board.Scenes that unfolded on the sidelines after the match showed team's owner Goenka involved in a serious dicussion with Rahul on the outcome of the match.The defeat pushed LSG down to number six on the points table after their sixth defeat in 12 matches, thereby making the team's task of qualifying for the playoffs tougher. SRH moved up to number three with their seventh win in 12 matches.As the footage of Goenka talking to Rahul was being aired on live broadcast, the commentators said: ""You always feel these conversations should always be behind closed doors. There are so many cameras that miss nothing, and KL Rahul is not going to go at press conferences and various other things and probably potentially explain what is being discussed there.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) captain Faf du Plessis has forged a strong friendship with batting legend Virat Kohli , especially since the South African joined Kohli at RCB and both started opening for the team in the Indian Premier League IPL ).Still having an outside chance in the race to IPL 2024 playoffs, RCB will take on Punjab Kings at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamsala on Thursday, as both the teams face a must-win situation.Ahead of the game, Du Plessis spoke about his bond with Kohli on the 'Captains Speak' segment of Star Sports show.""We both love food. We both are really into our fashion. That's another thing we spend a lot of time talking about. The way we dress, what style of clothes.

The only way to go through a tournament is to be honest with ourselves. We had those losses on the trot, we just had an honest conversation. We needed to pull up our socks.

Olympiakos secured their place in the Europa Conference League final by defeating Aston Villa 2-0 in the second leg of the semi-finals, marking a historic moment for the club. Led by Jose Luis Mendilibar, Olympiakos sealed a commanding 6-2 aggregate victory, largely thanks to Ayoub El Kaabi's brace, who had also scored a hat-trick in the first leg.The atmosphere at the Karaiskakis Stadium in Piraeus was electrifying as Olympiakos, boasting a record 47 Greek championships, earned their debut in a major European final.This achievement places them alongside Panathinaikos as the only Greek clubs to reach such heights, with Panathinaikos falling to Ajax in the 1971 European Cup final.The upcoming final against Fiorentina at the AEK Arena adds to the sense of destiny for Olympiakos, as it lies just 10 miles away from their home ground, further emphasizing the local rivalry.Despite Mendilibar's recent appointment in February, he has quickly become an iconic figure for Olympiakos, turning around their European fortunes after several disappointments in previous seasons.Under the ownership of Evangelos Marinakis, Olympiakos had struggled in Europe, failing to progress past the group stage 14 times out of 16 attempts. However, this season presents an opportunity for redemption, with Olympiakos aiming to secure their first European trophy in their nearly century-long history, a feat that would rival Greece's memorable Euro 2004 triumph.It has been a remarkable year for Olympiakos, highlighted by their Under-19 team's success in the UEFA Youth League final against AC Milan in April.On the other hand, Fiorentina booked their spot in the final by overcoming Club Brugge in the semi-finals, setting the stage for a thrilling showdown.Villa's departure marked a painful end to their quest for their first European final appearance since 1982. After returning to European competition following a 13-year hiatus, Villa now face the challenge of regrouping and redirecting their focus towards securing a top-four finish in the Premier League to qualify for the next season's Champions League.Under the guidance of Unai Emery, currently occupying fourth place in the league standings, Villa hold a seven-point lead over Tottenham, who sit in fifth place with three games remaining, compared to Villa's two.Early in the match, Olympiakos's Chiquinho had a chance on goal after bypassing Villa's defense, but his shot missed the target. However, Villa failed to take heed of this warning as Olympiakos capitalized on their defensive lapses to take the lead in the 10th minute.Despite Villa's attempts to find their rhythm, they struggled to coordinate their efforts, exemplified by Leon Bailey's slip as he attempted a shot that posed little threat to Olympiakos goalkeeper Kostas Tzolakis, who showcased his skill with a remarkable save to deny Bailey's powerful strike just before halftime.With Olympiakos firmly in control of the match, they pressed relentlessly and defended resolutely to keep Villa at bay.

Moments later, he secured the win with a second goal, albeit controversially initially ruled out for offside before being awarded following a VAR review .Reflecting on the team's indomitable spirit, midfielder Jude Bellingham remarked, ""We've seen it a lot of times this season when it looked as though we're dead and buried ... it doesn’t matter who scores the goals but someone always manages it... that mentality of never say die.""Real Madrid's dominance throughout the game was evident, with Vinicius Jr leading the charge down the left channel and Neuer putting up a valiant defense for Bayern.

The 2018 World Cup winner, who is set to leave PSG when his contract expires at the end of the season, likely to join Real Madrid , had hoped to sign off by guiding the club to European glory at Wembley next month.Despite PSG's status as favourites and their 31 attempts on goal, they failed to overturn a one-goal first-leg deficit, with Mats Hummels scoring the only goal of the night to secure a 2-0 aggregate victory for Dortmund. Mbappe, one of four PSG players to hit the woodwork in the second half, admitted that they needed to be more clinical in front of goal.""I don't really like to talk about bad luck. When you are good, you don't hit the post, you score. I tried to help the best I could. When I say we needed to be more clinical, I am the one who has to be scoring. But this is life, we need to pick ourselves up,"" Mbappe said after the loss.The defeat marks the closest Mbappe has come to lifting the European Cup with his hometown team, for whom he is their all-time top scorer with 255 goals, including 42 in the Champions League. The French sports daily L'Equipe described the result as ""the end of his dream"" and gave a scathing assessment of Mbappe's performance, rating him just two out of 10.PSG's elimination by a team sitting fifth in the Bundesliga is seen as a significant disappointment for a club that has invested heavily since the Qatari takeover in 2011. It is the latest in a series of Champions League knockout round failures, with their 6-1 defeat by Barcelona in 2017 still the most notable.Despite the presence of Mbappe, this PSG side was not seriously expected to reach this stage of the competition, having undergone a major overhaul following the departures of Lionel Messi and Neymar. Coach Luis Enrique, brought in to oversee the new project, acknowledged that his objective was to compete as well as possible for every trophy. Mbappe's final game for the club will now be the French Cup final against Lyon on May 25.The lack of experience at this level may have ultimately cost PSG, with their starting line-up having an average age of just 24 years and 157 days, the youngest for any team in a Champions League semi-final since Arsenal faced Manchester United in 2009. Captain Marquinhos emphasized the need to focus on the positives, saying, ""We need to remember that it is a new project with a new coach, with lots of changes. There are lots of positives and good things to take forward into next season.""However, it remains to be seen how PSG can improve their chances of winning the Champions League without Mbappe, even with the likely significant investment in a replacement.The coach's strategy of resting Mbappe or substituting him in domestic league games over the past three months, apparently in preparation for next season, has not ultimately helped PSG secure the trophy they most desire. As Mbappe, now 25, prepares to leave Paris, he will hope to finally get his hands on the Champions League trophy with his next club.",Kylian Mbappe is set to leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season.

All of us have a lot of passion for playing in national colours.There is this feeling that we will give our lives to win the game for India. So that’s the feeling I get and get connected emotionally when representing India.”While the 21-year-old has chosen to stay low before the final squad selection, the Assam footballer is one of the new faces that head coach Stimac chose to give a shot ahead of India’s vital June fixtures in quest to progress to the third round of World Cup qualifiers. He will join NEUFC teammate and fellow first-time India probable Jithin MS for the four-week camp in Bhubaneswar set to begin this week.And if NEUFC’s only player to score in four consecutive games for his club makes it into Stimac’s final squad, it will be a milestone in Gogoi’s journey from his father’s football training centre in Assam’s Sivasagar to donning the jersey for the senior national team.“My idol is Sunil Chhetri . And if I get to share the dressing room with him, I can learn so much from him. If young players get a chance in the Indian squad, we can learn so much from the senior players. But it depends on the coach. If he picks me, I will give my best,” Parthib said during a freewheeling interaction with TOI.Parthib, along with Jithin this season, has been a bright spot in the Highlanders’ last two Indian Super League campaigns and has been getting better with time and experience. He had eight shots on target, of which three were goals, in 18 appearances in 2022-23 and continued the form at Durand Cup this year with his first hat-trick for NEUFC.Having extended his NEUFC contract till 2026-27, Parthib scored five goals for his team this ISL season while also providing two assists. But what captivated fans are three spectacular strikes from long range – against title winners Mumbai City, Chennaiyin and East Bengal.Parthib expressed his love for such piledrivers during the interaction. “That’s something I really love to do. Even while playing FIFA on Playstation, I always look for opportunities to shoot from distance,” he said.Having started his football journey as a two-year-old by following his brother Pragyan – also his teammate and “mental support” at NEUFC – to the field, Parthib has had the support of his entire family in his pursuit.“My father and his colleagues started a football training centre in 2005 that trains kids even today. My brother used to go there for training from 2005. My father, who was not a footballer but loves the game, used to carry me to the ground when I was two to watch my brother play and if I liked it, I could play it too. So that's how my football journey started in 2007. Also, papa used to get football clips on his phone, like those of Messi or Ronaldo, for us and watching these clips, I got attracted to the game,” Parthib said before adding with a laugh, “I have broken many doors in my house.”Having climbed through the ranks of Assam age-group teams, Bengaluru’s Ozone Football Academy and Indian Arrows, Parthib has also represented India at age-group competitions, the most recent being U23 AFC Cup Qualifiers in China followed by friendlies in Indonesia.But the bigger test begins for him this week as he looks to grab a place in Stimac’s scheme of things and add a goalscoring touch to the squad against Kuwait and Qatar.Asked about his future goal, the Messi fan and self-proclaimed “Barcelona boy” said, “I want to become one of the best footballers in India.”The dream bodes well for India, too, with the team in dire need of goal scorers as Chhetri approaches his twilight days with the team.",Parthib Gogoi named among probables for India's World Cup qualifiers.

Premier League: Manchester United thumped 0-4 by Crystal Palace amid uncertainty over Erik ten Hag's future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/premier-league-manchester-united-thumped-0-4-by-crystal-palace-amid-uncertainty-over-erik-ten-hags-future/articleshow/109901537.cms,"(Inputs from Reuters)

NEW DELHI: Michael Olise 's two goals propelled Crystal Palace to a resounding 4-0 triumph over Manchester United at Selhurst Park on Monday, marking the first time in their history that Palace have secured a league double over the Red Devils. The result will undoubtedly intensify the scrutiny on United manager Erik ten Hag .Palace's attack repeatedly exploited United's patchwork defence, which featured Casemiro playing out of position at centre-back.Jean-Philippe Mateta and Tyrick Mitchell also found the back of the net in the commanding victory.Despite the loss, United remain in eighth place with 54 points from 35 games, trailing sixth-placed Newcastle United by two points. Their chances of securing European football for the upcoming season are rapidly diminishing. Palace, on the other hand, sit in 14th place with 43 points from 36 matches.United's injury woes were compounded by the absence of Bruno Fernandes, who missed a match due to injury for the first time in his 230-game Old Trafford career. The ease with which they were defeated will be a significant concern for everyone associated with the club.This marks the first instance in the Premier League era that United have suffered 13 defeats in a single season, and the scoreline could have been even more lopsided.Under the guidance of new manager Oliver Glasner, Palace have found their rhythm, while United are stumbling towards the end of a season that cannot conclude soon enough for Ten Hag.","Crystal Palace defeated Manchester United 4-0 at Selhurst Park on Monday.
