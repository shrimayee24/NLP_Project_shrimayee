The 3rd Test of the ongoing five-match series between India and England is shaping out into an exciting affair. The Indian bowling attack reduced England to a total of just 192 in their second innings, with India reaching 58/4 at stumps on Day 4. As passion and rivalry take center stage, former India spinner and veteran Ravichandran Ashwin has issued sharp remarks against umpire Paul Reiffel, detailing how 'difficult' it was to deal with him during his playing days.India came close to dismissing England batter Joe Root on Day 4 in the 2nd session, as Mohammed Siraj's sharp delivery was completely missed by the veteran. While the visitors were thoroughly convinced that they had the wicket in the bag, they were forced to control their frurstration as the DRS returned ‘umpire’s call’ on impact. Reacting to the same, Ashwin went on a detailed rant about the umpire, while in conversation with Vimal Kumar on his YouTube channel """".""My experience with Paul Reiffel has been that you always have to talk to him. You have to set him up. I'm not saying that you have to tell him 'give me the wicket', said the 38-year-old. Ashwin then went on a rant about the umpire and his calls, saying, ""Whenever India bowls, he (Paul Reiffel) feels that its not out. When India bats, he feels that its always out. If this was the case with every other team and not just India, then ICC will have to take a look at it.Ashwin's complaints on the match official didn't end there, as he made a hilarious comment on another decision of his. Pointing to a picture of the ball passing past the bat in a DRS check without making contact, Ashwin said, ""From between the bat and the ball, I own a car, a sedan, which can pass through the gap. It is clear that its not out.""Further venting his frustration, Ashwin shared his father's comment that India can never win a match when Paul Reiffel is the umpire. ""Whenever Paul Reiffel comes, we never win,"" Ashwin recounted his father's words.As India edge closer to potential victory on Day 5, the England bowlers will be hot on their heels to get early wickets and derail India's efforts. A win for India in this Test will see the visitors hold a 2-1 series lead heading into the penultimate match at Old Trafford Cricket Ground in Manchester.","Former India spinner and veteran Ravichandran Ashwin has issued sharp remarks against umpire Paul Reiffel.

As the five-match Test series between India and England hangs in the balance, it is safe to say that tensions have boiled over. Among both Indian and English stars, there have been numerous back-and-forths, with either side trying their best to get on the nerves of their opponents and gain an advantage in the process.If it was Shubman Gill who previously went viral for labelling England's brand of batting as ""boring"" after their slow and cautious approach in the first innings, the English squad responded with tenacity when it was their turn to bat. Coming out to bat for India in the second innings, the captain found himself in hostile territory. A cheeky comment aimed at the skipper was caught on the stump mic, which immediately went viral on social media.In an effort to unsettle the skipper, England opener Ben Duckett unleashed a subtle jab at Gill:“600 runs and he is done for the series. 600 runs is enough for this fella.”However, Duckett's comment did not provoke a reaction from Gill, who maintained his composure at the crease. Still, despite his calm exterior, Gill was forced to walk back to the pavilion after scoring just six runs off nine balls.His lbw dismissal by Brydon Carse marked a rare low point in the series, after he had amassed a combined 585 runs across the first two Tests.The 3rd Test, however, saw him score just 22 runs over both innings — an underwhelming return given his record-breaking start to life as India’s Test captain.With the series perfectly poised at 1-1, a fierce battle is expected on Day 5, as the English bowling attack looks to grab early wickets and derail India’s push for a second win. The Lord’s Test has already produced several fiery moments across the four days, with Mohammed Siraj and Shubman Gill at the forefront.Earlier in the match, India were furious with Zak Crawley ’s alleged time-wasting tactics, prompting captain Shubman Gill to tell him to “grow some f---ing balls.”","England and India are locked at 1-1 in the five-match Test series.

Poll Do you think Vaibhav Suryavanshi will have a successful career in red-ball cricket? Yes, definitely No, unlikely Maybe, depends on future performances

NEW DELHI: He arrived with intent, played a few crisp strokes, found the boundary rope early, and was then sent back — that summed up Vaibhav Suryavanshi’s outing in the opening match of the Youth Test series against England Under-19s. Coming off a stellar run in the Youth ODIs, the young batter showed flashes of his talent but couldn’t turn his promising start into a meaningful score.Walking in with confidence, the right-hander immediately made his presence felt, cracking three boundaries in the very first over — all off England pacer James Minto — briefly putting the hosts under pressure.But just as he looked to settle, England’s Alex Green delivered the breakthrough.Vaibhav was dismissed for 14 off 13 balls — a short but eventful innings marked by three boundaries and a strike rate of 107.69.Caught by Ralphie Albert off Green’s bowling, the early dismissal was a setback for the 14-year-old, who had hoped to carry his white-ball momentum into the red-ball format.However, with one innings still potentially to come, Suryavanshi may get another opportunity to make his mark in the longer format.India U-19, meanwhile, failed to finish on a high, losing the fifth Youth ODI by seven wickets. They had already sealed the five-match series 3-1 with a 55-run win in the fourth game.Suryavanshi had made history in that match, smashing the fastest known century in youth ODIs — a stunning 143 off just 78 balls in Worcester.With youth ODI records not officially documented in detail, his 52-ball century is believed to be the fastest in the format.That knock, featuring 13 fours and 10 sixes, powered India to a formidable total.Suryavanshi finished as India’s highest run-getter in the series, amassing 355 runs in five matches at an average of 71.00 and an incredible strike rate of 174.02.",Vaibhav Suryavanshi was dismissed for 14 off 13 balls in the opening match of the Youth Test series against England Under-19s.

Shedeur Sanders reportedly starts NFL camp as QB4, behind Flacco, Pickett, and Gabriel



TalkSport

SI

NFL fans are stunned Shedeur is behind a guy no one was watching



“What happened to all the early reports that he was lighting it up? 😂”

NFL fans shocked as Shedeur Sanders trails Dillon Gabriel in Browns QB race

This Browns QB room isn’t built for comfort, it’s built for war



From viral college stardom to NFL wake-up call, it looks like Shedeur Sanders is starting his pro journey with a dose of humble pie. The Browns’ QB room is crowded, and rumors say Coach Prime’s son is sitting 4th on the depth chart behind Dillon Gabriel. Yep, the same Dillon Gabriel who no one had trending on draft night. NFL Twitter? In full meltdown mode.According to multiple reports and online buzz, Shedeur Sanders is currently fourth on the Browns’ depth chart. Ahead of him: veteran Joe Flacco, former Steeler Kenny Pickett, and yes, rookie Dillon Gabriel. The rumor started circulating after insiders like Jason Lloyd and outlets likeandnoted the unexpected camp rotation order.It’s not an official announcement from Cleveland, but insiders say Shedeur is “working from behind” while Gabriel has impressed early in camp.Let’s be clear: it’s July. Preseason depth charts shift like Cleveland weather. But even still QB4 wasn’t what anyone had in mind for one of college football’s most talked-about quarterbacks.This isn’t about disrespect to Dillon Gabriel, the guy was solid at Oklahoma. But Shedeur Sanders came into the league with more press than some actual first-rounders.He was a media darling, a Coach Prime product, and a social media machine.So when rumors broke that Gabriel is ahead of Sanders in Browns camp, fans instantly lost it.Some fans joked that Shedeur's already entering his “transfer portal” era. Others just dropped memes of Deion Sanders looking disappointed.What’s wild is that none of these QBs are guaranteed the job. Flacco’s 39. Pickett’s still finding his rhythm. Gabriel’s got speed and instincts but no pro snaps. And Sanders? He’s raw, flashy, and full of upside but now he has to earn it.The Browns knew this QB battle would be messy, but no one expected Shedeur to be trailing this hard out of the gate. Still, the league moves fast, and one strong preseason outing can flip the narrative in hours.The internet crowned Shedeur Sanders months ago but in the NFL, there are no coronations. Just competition. And right now, he’s fighting uphill.He’s got time, talent, and a chip on his shoulder. But if he’s going to make this league take him seriously, he’s going to have to do it the hard way. Because right now, QB4 is real and Dillon Gabriel’s eating his lunch.Also read - “He’s in the sunken place”: Travis Kelce’s post-Taylor Swift transformation has fans spiraling","Shedeur Sanders reportedly starts NFL camp as QB4, behind Flacco, Pickett, and Gabriel.

Friendship on ice: Taylor Swift and Blake Lively ’s once-close bond crumbles

Blake Lively reportedly blames Justin Baldoni—and has a new strategy

It seems not even Taylor Swift ’s most cherished friendships are safe from Hollywood drama. According to insiders, the pop icon has gone radio silent on her longtime best friend Blake Lively—and the catalyst may be actor-director Justin Baldoni. But with Swift’s focus shifting more toward Travis Kelce and her carefully curated inner circle, fans are questioning if the rift is beyond repair...For years, Blake Lively was part of Taylor Swift’s elite inner circle—frequently appearing in behind-the-scenes snaps, attending birthday parties, and even lending her children’s names to Swift’s music. But sources say the two haven't been on speaking terms since Lively’s connection to Baldoni’s It Ends With Us legal drama unexpectedly dragged Swift into the spotlight.“After months of radio silence, Blake has stopped trying to reach out,” one insider revealed. “There is no recovering from this. Their friendship is done.”Fans quickly noticed the silence when Lively failed to like or acknowledge Swift’s celebratory post about reclaiming her music rights—a moment typically met with enthusiastic support from her tight-knit group. Swift, known for being fiercely loyal, apparently took Blake’s perceived alignment with Baldoni personally.Behind the scenes, Blake Lively is said to be frustrated that her public image took a hit due to Justin Baldoni’s legal team’s aggressive tactics. “Blake’s image took a huge hit with all the mud that Justin and his legal team threw at her, she lost her best friend,” a source explained.And now, with Swift's world increasingly dominated by her high-profile romance with NFL star Travis Kelce, it’s clear who has her attention these days. The tight end has become a steady presence in Swift’s whirlwind life, traveling across continents to be by her side. Some insiders believe Swift has re-centered her personal world, pushing out friendships that no longer serve or align with her evolving brand.Still, Blake Lively reportedly isn’t staying quiet. “She’s also looking to build up more high-profile bonds so she can show Taylor she is still a Hollywood heavyweight—and part of that is bitter,” another source added.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s masters win went viral with Jack Antonoff and her cat Meredith—but Travis Kelce quietly made it unforgettable As Swift gears up for another leg of the Eras Tour and Kelce preps for his next NFL season, one thing is certain: there may no longer be space in their storybook romance for past dragons.","Taylor Swift and Blake Lively's friendship appears to have fractured.

As the Stamford-based promotion is back again with another major event this week, with Saturday Night’s Main Event (SNME) at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta, Georgia, it has recently witnessed an intense feud between Gunther and Goldberg, where Gunther won and defended the World Heavyweight Championship title.Interestingly, the segment was WWE Hall of Famer Goldberg’s last bout, as the legend hung up his boots in Atlanta, Georgia, tonight. However, fortune did not favor the veteran wrestler as he had to face a crushing defeat at the hands of his arch-rival, Gunther. Let’s take a look at the highlights of the match now.Goldberg’s retirement bout began with thunderous applause from the fans during his entry in the ring for one last time. Goldberg's chants filled the arena in Atlanta, Georgia, by his beloved fans who gathered to watch the WWE legend one last time in the ring.The match began with the WWE Hall of Famer pushing off Gunther, who tried to lock in chops. The Ring General attacked him with two thudding chest chops, but Goldberg felt nothing as he took down the Champion with a brutal clothesline. Following this, Goldberg went for a spear, but the Champion ducked tactfully, causing him to go crashing through the barricade.Gunther next targeted Goldberg’s left knee, which everyone knew as his weak point for the seasoned wrestler. Even though he faced a tough start, Goldberg managed to break free and executed a powerful back body drop, shifting the momentum in his favor.However, out of nowhere, disaster struck when Goldberg accidentally speared the referee, bringing the match to a sudden halt. Actually. Goldberg went for the spear, but Gunther managed to duck again, and this time it's referee, Charles Robinson, fell into the deadly spear.Seizing this opportunity, Gunther capitalized again, removing the knee brace and flaunting it in front of the fans. The Ring General attacked Goldberg with the brace, and he did not stop him, hurting him physically, but added a personal twist when he taunted his son, Gage, who was watching from the ringside.Gunther, showing off his brace, climbed back into the ring, but he was taken down hard by a huge spear from Goldberg, who was eyeing the finishing move with the Jack Hammer. Just then, another referee rushed into the ring as the legend went for the pin, but Gunther managed to kick out just in time.In the final attempt, The Ring General locked in the sleeper on Goldberg, who tried very hard to fight back, but could not break himself out of the hold. The legend goes to sleep as he is unable to break the hold.

LeBron James intrigued by the Los Angeles Lakers ' futuristic vision as trade season whispers grow louder



In the midst of swirling trade speculation and mounting questions about his future in Los Angeles, LeBron James ' longtime agent, Rich Paul , has finally addressed the rumors head-on. As the Lakers pivot toward a future built around Luka Doncic and new acquisitions like Deandre Ayton, James is reportedly taking a step back to evaluate where he fits into the franchise’s evolving blueprint. With just one season remaining on his contract, the four-time NBA champion finds himself at a career crossroads, and the tension between legacy and change is more real than ever.As the Los Angeles Lakers reshape their roster with an eye toward the next decade, LeBron James is facing the most uncertain offseason of his legacy-enriched career. While the addition of Luka Doncic has sparked hope for a bright future in Los Angeles, it’s also led to speculation that the franchise may be preparing for life after LeBron.In a revealing report by ESPN’s Shams Charania, James is said to believe the Lakers ""are more in a futuristic mindset,” adding that “some hard conversations will need to happen.” Though James recently picked up his $52.6 million player option for the 2025-26 season, the decision appears more about flexibility than finality.Speaking to Charania, Rich Paul commented on where James and his team stand amid the speculation.""We understand the difficulty in winning now while preparing for the future,"" Paul said. ""We do want to evaluate what's best for LeBron at this stage in his life and career. He wants to make every season he has left count, and the Lakers understand that, are supportive and want what's best for him.""Despite averaging 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 8.2 assists last season, James and the Lakers were bounced in the first round of the playoffs for the second straight year. As front office executives Rob Pelinka and JJ Redick reshape the roster around Doncic, James has remained notably quiet.The silence has only amplified speculation. According to ESPN’s Brian Windhorst, one Eastern Conference executive is ""convinced James wanted out of LA,” with teams like the Golden State Warriors actively exploring trade packages. A potential blockbuster deal could even include both LeBron and Bronny James heading to the Bay Area in exchange for young assets like Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody.Meanwhile, former teammate Udonis Haslem added fuel to the fire on ESPN’s NBA Today, joking about James joining Stephen Curry. “If chef cooking up something, I’m showing up for dinner. For sure. That’s for damn sure. If chef cooking, I’m showing.""Also Read: LeBron James' Final Act? Lakers Set the Stage for a Legendary Hollywood Farewell in 2026Whether James ultimately stays or joins forces with Curry for one last title push, James is all up for retaining his legacy and retiring like a king in his potentially final season. Loyalty matters. So does legacy. But as Rich Paul bluntly said on ESPN, James “values a realistic chance of winning it all.”And if the Lakers can’t offer that, the King may be ready to move on.","LeBron James is reportedly taking a step back to evaluate where he fits into the Los Angeles Lakers' evolving blueprint.

After leading the Florida Panthers to back-to-back Stanley Cup championships, Matthew Tkachuk is in no mood to show mercy. When asked if he felt bad for Connor McDavid and the Edmonton Oilers, Tkachuk dismissed the suggestion outright.He pointed out that no one offered the Panthers sympathy when they lost in 2023 despite their injuries.

Despite the Panthers having the upper hand with two straight Finals wins, the tension shows no signs of cooling.Tkachuk, a former Calgary Flames forward, has a long history with the Oilers, and his latest comments reflect a personal edge that keeps this rivalry burning.According to Tkachuk, fans from Western Canada have been hoping for a break for the Edmonton Oilers. But his message was clear: the Stanley Cup isn’t something to be handed out for pity. His competitive mindset has no room for emotional appeals.His time in Calgary made him all too familiar with Edmonton’s hunger for a Cup and even more determined to deny it.While the Panthers celebrate, Connor McDavid and the Oilers are left facing another tough offseason.

Solo Sikoa also defended his United States Title in a heated clash with his own brother, Jimmy Uso. Meanwhile, Drew McIntyre went head-to-head with Randy Orton in a fierce showdown. After a week of intense back-and-forth confrontations, Seth Rollins and LA Knight finally settled their score in a must-see encounter at the event.Randy Orton picked up a win over Drew McIntyre in a one on one match, thanks to Jelly Roll. As the match reached its final moments, McIntyre got distracted by Jelly Roll at ringside, giving Orton the perfect opening to hit an RKO and secure the victory.After the match Logan Paul stormed the ring and floored Orton with a right hand, unleashing a series of punches. Jelly Roll quickly entered the ring, pulled Paul off Orton, and retaliated with a massive right hand of his own. However, McIntyre blindsided Jelly Roll with a brutal Claymore Kick and warned him that stepping into the ring made him a target. Adam Pearce, Nick Aldis, and several WWE officials rushed down to check on Jelly Roll and escort McIntyre to the back.Solo Sikoa retained the United States Championship in a wild encounter against Jimmy Uso, with crucial help from Talla Tonga. Late in the match, Jimmy nailed an Uso Splash from the top rope, nearly getting the three-count, but Sikoa kicked out just in time.Sikoa followed up with a Spinning Solo, but Jimmy avoided a Samoan Spike and fired back with a pair of superkicks. Jimmy then launched himself off the ropes to take out Talla, Loa, and Mateo at ringside. As the referee began the ten-count, both competitors made it back to the ring. Jimmy landed a stiff kick to Talla, but Sikoa capitalized, rolling Jimmy up for the pin while Talla held him down from the outside, sealing the controversial win.The action kicked off with LA Knight launching a series of strikes in an attempt to take down Rollins. However, “The Architect” quickly countered and fired back with heavy offense of his own. Rollins even hit a high-impact Frog Splash, but Knight showed resilience by kicking out.Momentum shifted when LA Knight got back on his feet and unleashed some strikes, gaining control. He followed up with his signature flying elbow drop from the top turnbuckle, but Rollins again kicked out, refusing to stay down.Rollins retaliated with a Buckle Bomb and aimed to finish the match with a Curb Stomp, but Knight dodged just in time.

Tiffany Mitchell’s battle with sepsis

WNBA star Tiffany Mitchell has signed with the Seattle Storm as a free agent. The 30-year-old shooting guard was previously with the Las Vegas Aces before making the move to the Storm, a team in urgent need of experienced and dynamic players. Mitchell’s return to the court is nothing short of inspiring — just months ago, she was fighting for her life after being diagnosed with sepsis.Tiffany Mitchell revealed that during her health crisis, basketball was the last thing on her mind — her only focus was survival. In a video shared with her fans, she gave a raw and emotional glimpse into the harrowing journey she endured. She recounted how a routine surgery took a devastating turn.“I went in for a surgery that I was supposed to heal from in a week or two, but during that period, I could tell I wasn't getting better,” she explained. “I had to return to the hospital. I went back three times before they finally discovered I was septic. During that time, I just disappeared. I think it was during the All-Star break— I was supposed to rejoin the team afterward, but I never came back.”Detailing her symptoms and the severity of her condition, she continued, “I had an extremely high fever.It felt like I was being stabbed in my abdomen. Fluid began to surround my lungs, and breathing became difficult. I couldn’t do anything for myself. I was always in pain. As someone who’s always been strong, having all of that taken away was devastating. At that point, I wasn’t thinking about returning to basketball — I just wanted to live. There were days I truly didn’t think I’d make it through.”Ending the video on a powerful note, Mitchell declared, “I'm a fighter. I've always been a fighter my whole life.” The video was shared only after her return to the court this season. Fans and fellow athletes flooded the comments with support, praising her strength, resilience, and inspiring comeback.Also Read: WNBA star Angel Reese diverts attention towards her mother after a frustrating loss against the Washington Mystics This marks Tiffany Mitchell’s tenth year in the WNBA, and the star guard shows no signs of slowing down.

could be on the move. With the Los Angeles Lakers front office reportedly preparing for a future led by Luka Dončić, the 40-year-old superstar might have a better shot at adding a fifth championship ring elsewhere—specifically, with theAccording to a report by ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne and Brian Windhorst, the Golden State Warriors have reached out to the Lakers to discuss a potential trade for James. While the deal is still speculative, the possibility of pairing LeBron with Steph Curry and Jimmy Butler has sparked massive interest across the league.As Erik Beaston wrote in his July 13 article, “It is with that team, and stars Steph Curry and Jimmy Butler, that James has the best chance to win that elusive championship.”The Golden State Warriors are not strangers to chasing titles with superstar cores. Adding LeBron James to a lineup that already includes Curry and Butler would instantly form one of the most seasoned and intelligent big threes in NBA history. Each of them has championship experience and thrives under high-pressure scenarios.James has thrived in similar big-three dynamics before:- Miami Heat: LeBron, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh- Cleveland Cavaliers: LeBron, Kyrie Irving, Kevin LoveGolden State would be no different, offering a structured system and battle-tested teammates to maximize LeBron’s championship window.If the Golden State Warriors want to land LeBron, they’ll have to give up a hefty package. According to the same ESPN report, these players and assets could be included:While the cost may seem steep, James is far from your typical 40-year-old NBA veteran.Despite turning 40, LeBron James continued to put up elite-level numbers:- Points per game: 24.4- Rebounds: 7.8- Assists: 8.2- Field Goal Percentage: 51.3%- Minutes per game: 34.9- Games missed due to injury: 12His performance proves that he’s still one of the most impactful players in the league when healthy.Realistically, such a blockbuster deal remains a long shot. But in an NBA landscape where Dončić himself was recently traded in a move that shocked the sports world, it’s clear that no scenario is off the table.T he modern NBA is unpredictable, and if the Lakers are truly entering a rebuild while the Golden State Warriors want one last shot at a ring, LeBron-to-Golden State might not be as far-fetched as it once seemed.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: San Antonio Spurs Could Land $186 million Milwaukee Bucks Big Man in Massive Blockbuster Deal to pair with Victor Wembanyama LeBron James still has elite basketball left in him.

Johnny Gaudreau's arrival redefined the Columbus Blue Jackets' identity

A start with a spark, a season with struggles

July 13, 2022, was a watershed date that altered the narrative of the Columbus Blue Jackets. For a franchise long deemed to be outside the bright lights of major NHL free agency splashes, the signing of Johnny Gaudreau sent shockwaves not just across Ohio but throughout the hockey world. This must have been more than just an acquisition; it was a statement. From then on, ""Johnny Hockey"" choosing Columbus besides the big markets has been an indelible moment in the history books of the Blue Jackets.For decades, Columbus had a reputation as a city where NHL stars left, not landed in. The signing of Johnny Gaudreau went against every clichés the fans had reluctantly accepted. One of the league's most dynamic forwards, Gaudreau was no ordinary free agent; he was the free agent of 2022. An unlikely candidate for an offer this late into his career, he had nine years in the Calgary Flames and enjoyed a career year last season with 115 points in 2021-22. Players of this caliber usually never even hit the open market.The shock was caused not only by Gaudreau's decision to leave Calgary but also by the perceived underdog status of the team with which he signed. Some fans would even say the rumors of Gaudreau going to Columbus were just internet chatter, but the truth burst forth suddenly, sending shockwaves through the community.The hockey universe had already started buzzing by the time Elliotte Friedman took Twitter to confirm the news.For Gaudreau, partnering with Columbus was about more than just the contract. It was about fit, comfort, and opportunity. To the fans, it meant belief that Columbus could finally stand for a destination, not a detour.Johnny Gaudreau's first outing at Nationwide Arena on October 14, 2022, against the Tampa Bay Lightning was nothing short of cinematic. He scored his very first Blue Jackets goal in less than three minutes since the puck dropped. The roar from the nearly evening-starved venue confirmed the warm embrace of Columbus toward its new star.In his debut season, Gaudreau was an offensive force with 21 goals and 74 points in a year when the team lost more than 500 man-games to injury. Gaudreau missed two games all year while setting a personal best of 21 power-play assists, tying his career high.The next season was taxing for both the team and its star. With the roster inconsistent and missing key bodies for weeks on end, including Gaudreau's linemate Patrik Laine, his numbers slid to 60 points in 81 games. Yet throughout the struggles, he was there for the team, committed to the cause.Also Read: Christian Dvorak perceives an opportunity with the Philadelphia Flyers against opposing NHL teams, offering contracts Signing Johnny Gaudreau was more than just a free agency coup; it was a cultural awakening for the Columbus Blue Jackets. Since then, he has been through roadblocks and challenges, but from the day he put on that Union Blue sweater, the franchise has never looked at itself, or the NHL has never looked at Columbus in the same way.","Johnny Gaudreau's arrival redefined the Columbus Blue Jackets' identity.

Imagine winning a championship, earning Playoff MVP, and getting shipped out right after. That’s the exact plot twist Artūrs Šilovs just lived. Fresh off carrying Abbotsford to a Calder Cup win, the Vancouver Canucks sent their breakout goalie to the Pittsburgh Penguins and hockey fans are trying to make sense of it.Is it a rebuild move? A roster squeeze? A masterclass steal by Pittsburgh? Either way, Šilovs might be the hottest goalie traded this offseason.Šilovs wasn’t just good in the AHL playoffs, he was absolutely lights out. The 24-year-old Latvian brick wall posted a .931 save percentage and five shutouts in 24 games, tying an AHL playoff record and earning the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy as postseason MVP.He carried Abbotsford (Vancouver’s AHL affiliate) through every elimination game and stood tall under pressure. Fans were ready to see him as the next big name in Vancouver’s crease. And then, boom. Trade alert.The deal went down quietly:Not exactly blockbuster buzz, but the potential is huge. Šilovs had already played 10 NHL games with Vancouver but was stuck behind Thatcher Demko and backup Casey DeSmith. Now, in Pittsburgh, he gets a chance to compete for real NHL minutes and maybe more.Pittsburgh’s goalie situation isn’t locked in, which means Šilovs could carve out a legit role this season.He’s only 24, he’s signed through 2025–26 at a super team-friendly $850K cap hit, and he’s got playoff swagger built in.If he finds his groove in the NHL like he did in the AHL? This could look like one of those “how did they pull that off?” trades in a year. This wasn’t a headline-grabbing, flashy NHL trade. But it might be one of the smartest ones.Šilovs is coming in hot, literally MVP-hot and ready to prove he’s more than just AHL elite.

Katie Gaudreau walks down the aisle after postponing wedding due to brothers’ deaths



Nearly a year after the tragic loss of her beloved brothers Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau, Katie Gaudreau found a way to turn heartbreak into a tribute of love, resilience, and memory. On July 11, she finally walked down the aisle to marry her longtime partner, Devin Joyce — a moment that had once been filled with anticipation but became a symbol of strength following unimaginable grief.Originally planned for August 30, 2024, the wedding was postponed after the sudden death of Johnny and Matthew, who were struck and killed by an alleged drunk driver while cycling in their New Jersey hometown. Both brothers were slated to be groomsmen. Their loss devastated not only their family but also the hockey community — Johnny had been a standout for the Columbus Blue Jackets, while Matthew built his career across leagues including Boston College, the AHL, and ECHL.Despite the overwhelming sorrow, Katie and Devin, who first met in high school and got engaged in May 2023, chose to embrace love and healing. “And I know, deep in my heart, that they would have wanted us to feel love — not just their love — but all of it: the kind that surrounds us, uplifts us and reminds us that we are not alone in any of this,” Katie told People.Her wedding became a poignant blend of celebration and remembrance. From her veil stitched with personal messages in her brothers’ handwriting — “Love you — Matty” and “Love ya — John” — to socks worn by groomsmen bearing Johnny and Matthew’s jersey numbers (13 and 21), every detail was intentional. A moving video montage of the brothers’ joyful moments played during the reception to the tune of “Mr. Brightside,” a favorite of Katie’s.Planning the ceremony wasn’t easy. Katie admitted that the venue had to be changed to a more comforting environment. “I wanted a space where we could all be together the night before — somewhere we could sleep over, wake up together, and just be, without having to leave or be separated. I was having a lot of anxiety about everyone leaving the venue after the reception and something happening, so I wanted a space where we would all be together. ” she said, reflecting on her fears of being separated from loved ones again.Her bouquet, too, told a story — arranged with 21 standard roses and 13 spray rose blooms in honor of the Gaudreau brothers’ hockey numbers. Even her father, Guy Gaudreau, and Devin wore suits lined with photos of Johnny and Matthew — keeping their presence tangible in the most meaningful way.“It’s hard to put into words how much has shifted and how much I’ve carried in my heart since last August,” Katie shared.

Jimmy Butler backs Stephen Curry in heartfelt Tahoe appearance during offseason golf showdown



The Golden State Warriors teammates Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler have recently grabbed attention after a clip of the duo appeared online. Butler came to support Curry in Tahoe as the Warriors veteran having his best of time playing golf.Stephen Curry’s attempt to reclaim his American Century Championship crown certainly got a surprise boost from Butler. As Curry stepped into the final round of the celebrity golf tournament in South Lake Tahoe, Butler’s courtside energy followed him to the fairways. The four-time NBA champion was locked in and rising through the ranks on Sunday, and the presence of Butler, who joined the Warriors earlier this year, added to the moral support.Jimmy Butler’s unexpected appearance at Edgewood Tahoe showed the growing chemistry between two elite competitors. Despite being fresh off a playoff exit, Butler made the trip to stand behind his teammate during the ACC tournament’s final stretch. “Some familiar faces made it to Tahoe,” the Golden State Warriors posted on X, alongside a video of Butler patiently waiting for Curry on the course.Their growing friendship has been one of the more exciting developments for Warriors fans since Butler was acquired in a blockbuster five-team deal.The trade sent Andrew Wiggins, Kyle Anderson, and a protected first-round pick out the door in exchange for Butler.Butler and Curry, who last played together on May 14 in the Western Conference semifinals against the Timberwolves, are using this offseason to strengthen their off-court bond before heading into their first full campaign as teammates this fall. Butler’s late-season arrival already paid off in flashes, and now the duo looks poised to lead a new era for the Warriors.Curry, meanwhile, returned to the American Century Championship after missing last year’s tournament due to his Olympic commitments in Paris. The 2023 champion didn’t take his prep lightly, even if his words hinted at a relaxed approach. “So I’ve learned playing in this tournament for what, 10, 11 years, you have expectations, and you’re trying to, it’s almost like pulling an all-nighter for a test, trying to cram everything,"" Curry said. ""Because, you know, I play a decent amount, but nobody ever says, ‘I play enough golf or practice enough.’ So as long as I have a good idea of what I’m trying to do, I can just live with the results, which is where I’m now.”Though Curry couldn’t capture the title, finishing tied for third with 58 points, his Sunday surge, rising from T9 to T3, marked his best showing of the weekend. With Butler looking on, he even edged out former NFL stars and fan favorites like Tony Romo, Adam Thielen, and Taylor Twellman.It was not all.

James Prioritizing Contention

Balancing Dončić’s Future and LeBron’s Timeline

Despite a swirl of speculation surrounding’ future, thestar has not asked for a trade, according to his agent Rich Paul. As the franchise continues to balance long-term planning with immediate championship ambitions, the offseason noise surrounding LeBron has only grown louder. But according to both James’ camp and team insiders, it’s still business as usual in L.A.During ESPN’s Summer League broadcast on Saturday, Dave McMenamin reported key insights from a conversation with Rich Paul. Although four teams have expressed interest in acquiring LeBron James , Paul emphasized that no trade request has been made.“Paul also made it clear to me that LeBron has not asked for a trade. And Paul hasn’t even discussed the possibility of wanting a trade in the future with the Lakers,” McMenamin said.According to Paul, the Los Angeles Lakers have not received any formal trade request, nor has LeBron James himself initiated or even hinted at such a conversation. When approached by McMenamin before tip-off to discuss the rumors, LeBron replied, “I ain’t got nothing to talk about.”While the specific teams weren’t named, ESPN insiders Ramona Shelburne and Brian Windhorst reported that the Golden State Warriors were among those who “considered” making a move for LeBron this offseason.Though nothing materialized, the mere idea of a team trading for a 41-year-old in the final year of his contract, who also happens to be the league’s all-time leading scorer, added fuel to the rumor mill.LeBron James exercised his $52.6 million player option for the upcoming season, putting him on an expiring deal. That, combined with his age and the Lakers’ evolving roster, naturally creates some uncertainty. Here’s what the Lakers currently have in terms of potential trade assets:The Lakers also face a July 20 deadline to decide on Shake Milton’s contract, a smaller move that could still impact roster flexibility.Paul acknowledged earlier this offseason in an interview with Shams Charania that James is closely monitoring the Los Angeles Lakers’ moves and remains focused on competing for another title.“LeBron wants to compete for a championship,” Paul said. “He knows the Lakers are building for the future. He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all.”With the Lakers bringing in and Jake LaRavia, it remains to be seen whether those additions are enough to convince LeBron that the team can challenge contenders like the Nuggets, Celtics, or Timberwolves—the latter of whom ousted the Lakers in just five games during last season’s first round.L.A.’s current strategy appears to hinge on Luka Dončić, who is entering his prime at 26. While the team is motivated to build around the superstar guard long-term, that vision may not align perfectly with LeBron’s win-now mentality.Charania mentioned during an appearance on SiriusXM NBA Radio that James “feels clearly that the Lakers are more in a futuristic mindset” and suggested that “hard conversations” may soon be necessary.For now, there’s no trade request. LeBron remains with the Lakers as they attempt to bridge a championship window and a rebuild. However, with interest from around the league and ongoing questions about the team’s direction, it’s likely that LeBron James and the front office will need to revisit the conversation if things don’t click quickly next season.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors could sgin $52.6 million Los Angeles Lakers superstar, improving his odds at 5th Championship title Until then, as Rich Paul made clear, the King is staying put.","LeBron James has not asked for a trade, according to his agent Rich Paul.

Seth Rollins Has a History of Knee Injuries Amid the Latest Scare

In what was meant to be another pitstop in Seth Rollins ’ rise to the top of Monday Night Raw, a legit injury has supposedly halted the former World Champion’s momentum. In his co-main event outing against LA Knight at Saturday Night’s Main Event, ‘The Visionary’ suffered a legitimate knee injury while performing a routine Lionsault off the second rope.To avoid disaster, Knight moved out of the way. Rollins then landed awkwardly on his feet and, in turn, seemed to buckle his knee. The former Universal Champion immediately winced in pain and dragged himself to the corner of the ring while clutching it.At first, it seemed to be a method of deception from ‘The Architect,’ but just moments later, it was clear that Rollins was in legitimate pain. The Money in the Bank holder talked to the ringside doctor, Paul Heyman, with the referee trying to separate Knight from Rollins. Just moments later, Rollins tried to get up on his feet but was immediately planted with a BFT for Knight to pick up the win.This was an impromptu and early finish to the match as the cameras panned to commentators Michael Cole and Wade Barrett, who informed the fans that Rollins was indeed in trouble. During the commercial break, Rollins was assisted by the medical staff and escorted to the backstage area.For the unversed, Rollins already has had issues with his right knee as he tore his ACL, MCL, and meniscus back in November 2015 at a house show in Dublin and had to miss WrestleMania 32 due to the injury.In the latest update, Fightful Select reported that the injury scare was indeed legitimate and “it had at least not been planned for by medical personnel.” Moreover, original plans for the match had Rollins going over Knight, but plans were changed owing to the situation. Another insider wrestling account, WrestleVotes, stated that “the sense from a source just now is the Seth Rollins injury is legit.”This unfortunate incident occurred at a time when Rollins is primed to be the top heel on Raw and was expected to capture the World title in the next few months. Moreover, his alliance with Paul Heyman, Bron Breakker, and Bronson Reed was starting to pay dividends, with the faction garnering positive fan reactions from the WWE Universe. It will be interesting to see how WWE will respond and make changes to its existing storylines after this huge setback.Also read: WWE Saturday Night’s Main Event Live (July 12, 2025) Highlights and Results: Gunther beats Goldberg, LA Knight defeats Seth Rollins, and More",Seth Rollins suffered a legitimate knee injury against LA Knight at Saturday Night’s Main Event.

Poll Who was the standout player in the MLC 2025 final? Rushil Ugarkar Trent Boult Quinton de Kock

MI New York are the Major League Cricket 2025 champions after a nerve-wracking five-run win over Washington Freedom in the final. It was young Rushil Ugarkar who sealed the deal, defending 12 runs in the last over against the dangerous Glenn Maxwell and Glenn Phillips. The 22-year-old showed remarkable composure, mixing his pace smartly and sticking to his plans to finish the job for his team. Trent Boult gave MINY the dream start with two wickets in the opening over, reducing Freedom to 0 for 2. Rachin Ravindra (70) and Jack Edwards (33) fought back brilliantly, keeping their team in the hunt. Phillips’ late surge threatened to tilt the game again, but MI New York held firm. Boult’s spell (2/22) and Rushil’s nerveless final over proved decisive.Earlier, MINY had posted 180 for 7 after a flying start from Quinton de Kock (77 off 46) and Monank Patel. Despite a middle-order wobble, a useful contribution from Kunwarjeet Singh pushed the score past 175. Kieron Pollard was full of emotion after the win. “Everyone wrote us off. But there’s something in this franchise. The belief was unbelievable,” said the MINY captain.This win completes a hat-trick of titles for the MI franchise in 2025. After winning the SA20 and the WPL earlier this year, they now have the MLC trophy in the cabinet. It’s the 13th major trophy across formats for the Mumbai Indians group, highlighting their global dominance in franchise cricket.","MI New York are the Major League Cricket 2025 champions after a five-run win over Washington Freedom in the final.

The third Test of the five-match series between India and England is shaping up to be a fiery affair. From heated comments to cheeky jabs and passionate celebrations, the series has kept fans on edge. While Indian batters will take to the crease on Monday, they need 135 runs to take a 2-1 lead in the series.However, despite their best efforts, Jofra Archer, Brydon Carse, and then Ben Stokes ensured that India lost four wickets, including crucial players like Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, and Karun Nair.Of all the wickets that India lost after coming in to bat on Day 4, the most regrettable remains that of Karun Nair. The No. 3 batter’s 'brain fade' moment was highlighted on social media as fans lamented the 33-year-old's 'bad luck.'After initially appearing confident at the crease, a seemingly 'ordinary' delivery from Brydon Carse ended his innings at just 14 runs from 33 balls. After the umpire promptly raised his finger for LBW, the batter didn't even consider a review.Reacting to his dismissal, former India spinner and veteran Ravichandran Ashwin voiced his concerns.Speaking to Vimal Kumar on his YouTube channel ""Ash ki Baat,"" the 38-year-old discussed how Nair should not have lost his wicket so cheaply.""I really was hoping for Karun (Nair) to come good. He has batted well in pockets but hasn’t really put that spot to bed. Today as well, he left a rather straight delivery. It is about pressure. These mistakes will only come because of pressure.""Several others were disappointed with Nair’s showing, including the likes of Dinesh Karthik and Michael Atherton. Reacting to his wicket, Karthik said: ""I don’t know what he was thinking. Karun Nair expected the ball to probably swing away, but it didn’t—it just held its line, kept coming straight. Pretty ordinary leave. Brydon Carse loving it, it’s an important wicket.""Adding to Karthik’s observations, England legend Michael Atherton said: ""It’s a very strange leave from Karun Nair. Particularly at the end he’s batting—the pavilion end—so you know naturally the ball is going to run back in at you, down the slope. So it’s an odd leave.""""To make matters worse, he’ll have a big bruise there in the morning because it hit him on the inside of the pad, so he had to hobble off,"" Atherton observed on air.After an exciting return to the Indian Test side following an eight-year hiatus, the batter has failed to make the No. 3 spot his own, often struggling to get the runs flowing—as reflected in his numbers so far this series.","India lost four wickets after coming in to bat on Day 4 of third Test against England.

Why Shubman Gill, Jasprit Bumrah lost their cool in last five minutes of Day 3 vs England

Former England cricketer Jonathan Trott has slammed India captain Shubman Gill for gesticulating towards Zak Crawley and shouting an expletive in his direction in the last over of Day 3 of the Lord's Test.Opener Zak Crawley repeatedly delayed bowler Jasprit Bumrah and called for a physio after being hit on the finger, successfully ensuring that he and Ben Duckett had to face only one over before the close of play, instead of two. Crawley’s time-wasting tactics infuriated Gill and his teammates.Gill pointed his finger at Crawley and told him to “grow some f***ing balls.” Duckett quickly intervened, positioning himself between them, but the verbal exchange continued. A ball later, Gill rushed to Crawley and held his arms up in an X. Crawley responded by waving a finger at Gill.Trott compared Gill's antics to those of former India captain Virat Kohli.“We don’t know what went on when England were fielding, whether they were dishing it out. But I don’t like the acting from Shubman Gill; as a captain, you set the tone,” Trott said on JioHotstar.“Pointing fingers and getting very confrontational — very much like a previous captain — getting in the face of the opposition.“I’m all for being competitive and tough on the field, but sometimes you have to rise above it. It sets up nicely for tomorrow’s play.”The third Test between India and England is finely balanced, with no clear favourite at this stage.KL Rahul racked up his second hundred at the iconic Lord’s before India matched England’s first-innings total of 387 on an attritional day, leaving the game on an even keel on a deteriorating pitch.Besides Rahul’s high-quality effort (100 off 177), Ravindra Jadeja (72 off 131) and Rishabh Pant (74 off 112) propped up India’s first-innings total.It will be a challenge for India to bat last on a surface where the odd ball is taking off after pitching and is offering some turn.",Former England cricketer Jonathan Trott has slammed India captain Shubman Gill for gesticulating towards Zak Crawley.

Panthers push for three-peat with Marchand and Seth Jones; Mathew Tkachuk calls it ‘amazing’

Matthew Tkachuk Has Made Winning Stanley Cups Look Easy (Full Interview) | Stugotz

The Florida Panthers in order to retain core players like Sam Bennett, Aaron Ekblad, and Brad Marchand, successfully navigated salary cap challenges. Despite the potential to earn significantly more elsewhere, the team secured these players, with long-term, team-friendly contracts, influencing their championship success. Matthew Tkachuk expressed strong approval for these crucial roster moves.The Florida Panthers pulled off a magic trick with their team, keeping key players like Sam Bennett, Aaron Ekblad, and Brad Marchand even with a tight budget. How'd they do it? Their secret weapon, which convinced these guys to take a bit less money than they could've gotten elsewhere, was their winning spirit and two Stanley Cup championships.Aaron Ekblad, a top defenseman, signed an eight-year deal for $6.1 million a year. That's a steal when he could've easily charged over $10 million! And Sam Bennett followed suit, taking an $8 million AAV over eight years, turning down potential $10 million offers. Since both wanted to keep winning, they both chose to stay. Even Brad Marchand is sticking around for another six years at $5.33 million a year.Matthew Tkachuk, one of the Panthers' stars, even with the money crunch, was absolutely thrilled about these moves.When asked if he was upset about Marchand joining, he practically flared: ""I loved it. I knew that was a guy, with Seth Jones, who could put us over the hump. Now they’re here for the next five years — Marchy, six. Two culture guys and glue guys we’re lucky to have.""He even found it funny, inserting, ""No. I find it funny that hockey players want to stay in South Florida to play hockey — and will stay for less money. That’s amazing. It’s the greatest place to play in the NHL. Hopefully we’re not stopping at two.""It really indicates how much these players believe in the Panthers' winning formula and love playing in South Florida. Tkachuk himself is locked in for eight years at $76 million, and racking up points and helping them grab those two championships, he's been a huge part of their recent success.Also Read: “Just frustrating”: Ryan Reaves slams toxic Leafs fans, says they drove Mitch Marner out of Toronto after years of loyalty Being traded from the Calgary Flames, he's been with the Panthers for three seasons since in 2022.

Artemi Panarin’s future with the Rangers hangs in the balance as contract nears expiry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/artemi-panarins-future-with-the-rangers-hangs-in-the-balance-as-contract-nears-expiry/articleshow/122397170.cms,"Insider hints Rangers are preparing to move on from Artemi Panarin sooner than fans realize (Getty Images)

Rangers may lose Artemi Panarin amid rising speculation and behind-the-scenes tensions



The New York Rangers are at a crossroads, and all eyes are on Artemi Panarin. Despite an impressive regular-season performance from the star forward, the Rangers missed the postseason — an outcome the front office is determined to prevent moving forward. But doing that while managing the salary cap and aging roster has presented a complex challenge, especially as Panarin’s eight-year, $81.5 million contract nears its end in 2026.Still producing at an elite level, Panarin notched 89 points last season, following a stellar 120-point campaign in 2023-24. Yet, at 33 years old, he remains both an invaluable asset and a financial question mark. The team’s top brass, led by President and GM Chris Drury, has shown a willingness to part ways with veteran contracts that no longer justify their price tag — most recently seen with the trades of Chris Kreider and Barclay Goodrow.While Arthur Staple of The Athletic reported that Panarin is considered “one of the team’s only untouchables,” his age and cap hit are hard to ignore. The team may be reluctant to commit to another long-term deal that could age poorly — especially with an eye on building a younger, faster core to remain competitive in the coming seasons.According to Bleacher Report’s Lyle Richardson, “The Rangers can afford to re-sign Panarin on a short-term deal with a slight pay cut to around $10 million annually.However, his future in New York could depend on the Blueshirts' performance in 2025-26. Another missed postseason could lead to his departure to a Stanley Cup contender next July.”This raises a strategic dilemma for New York. Letting Panarin hit free agency without compensation would be a major loss, given his consistent production — 37 goals and 52 assists last season alone. Trading him now could recoup assets but might also derail their postseason hopes. Extending him would keep one of the league’s top point producers, but at a potential long-term cost.There’s no question Panarin remains a game-changer. But the Rangers know the window to win with their current core is narrowing. Whether they choose to trade him, extend him, or let him walk, the decision will shape the team’s trajectory for years to come.The writing may already be on the wall, and one thing is certain — the Rangers can’t afford to wait until next July to decide Panarin’s fate.Also Read: Connor McDavid's patience tested as Oilers trade key prospect amid rising 2025-26 expectations","Rangers may lose Artemi Panarin amid rising speculation and behind-the-scenes tensions.

From promising NHL talent to international shame

Criminal charges and fallout from the team

Dillon Dubé, once a rising star in Canadian hockey, is now at the center of one of the most disturbing scandals the sport has seen in years. The 26-year-old forward, formerly with the Calgary Flames, is one of several NHL players charged in connection with the 2018 Hockey Canada sexual assault investigation — a case that has sent shockwaves through both the league and the public.Dubé, born July 20, 1998, in Golden, British Columbia, was once viewed as a promising young forward with strong leadership qualities. He captained Team Canada to gold at the 2018 World Junior Championships and was drafted 56th overall by the Calgary Flames in 2016. After breaking into the NHL in 2018, he became a regular in the Flames’ lineup and signed a three-year, $6.9 million extension in 2021.But his career took a dramatic turn in early 2024.On January 21, 2024, the Flames announced that Dubé was taking an indefinite leave to address mental health issues. Just days later, the shocking news broke: “Representative for Calgary's Dillon Dubé confirm to The Athletic he's been charged with sexual assault by London Police,” tweeted Ian Mendes on January 30.The London Police Service formally charged Dubé on February 5, 2024, for an alleged sexual assault that occurred in 2018 in London, Ontario.The Calgary Flames immediately issued a statement distancing themselves, noting they “had no knowledge of pending charges at the time Dillon's request for a leave of absence was granted.”By the end of the 2023–24 season, the Flames declined to extend a qualifying offer, making Dubé an unrestricted free agent. On July 1, 2024, he signed a one-year deal with HC Dinamo Minsk in the KHL — a clear sign of his exile from the NHL amid the legal proceedings.Also Read: Who is Cal Foote?

BENGALURU: Battling through snow patches, rugged mountains, and 45 hours of non-stop running, Ashwini Ganapathi, a 39-year-old endurance athlete and coach from Karnataka, achieved a rare feat by finishing the Deep Japan Ultra 100, one of Asia's most demanding trail races.The ultra-endurance event, which began on June 27, saw 135 runners at the start line, including eight international participants. Only 63 managed to finish, and Ashwini stood out as the only non-Japanese athlete — across both men and women — to complete the 173km course, which also involved a punishing 9,000-metre elevation gain, higher than Mount Everest. She was the 10th woman overall to cross the finish line.""I completed the race in 45 hours and 42 minutes, carrying over 6kg of mandatory safety gear, plus food and water that brought my pack weight up to 8kg. As a vegetarian in Japan, I couldn't depend on local aid stations, so I carried everything I needed for the entire race. The dropout rate was huge — 72 runners did not finish — which shows just how brutal the course was,"" Ashwini shared.The Deep Japan Ultra 100 course featured three major mountain climbs — including Mount Asakusa and Mount Sumo — and was set on a treacherous terrain about 300km from Tokyo. ""There were snow patches on one summit that we had to cross three times, and several sections were so steep we needed ropes and chains to climb or descend,"" she said.The weather added to the challenge, swinging from humid and cloudy conditions on day one to blazing 33°C heat the next.There were no camps or sleep breaks — just aid stations sometimes spaced 28km apart, unlike the 10km intervals common in Indian trail races. ""I didn't sleep for two nights. I tried for five minutes in a nap room, but I just couldn't. We were on our feet the whole time,"" said Ashwini, who was funded by Tekion, an automotive retail tech company under its ‘Tekion for Good' CSR initiative.Full-time focus on fitnessAshwini is a full-time running coach. A former IT professional, she quit her corporate career after nine years to pursue fitness full-time. ""I was athletic all my life — I played field hockey in school — but realised I was better at endurance than speed. While others focused on minutes, I wanted to see how far I could go. That's how I got into ultrarunning.""Her passion for endurance races dates back to 2019, during the Malnad Ultra (110km) in Karnataka. ""I still had energy after running 100km. That's when I started dreaming about doing a 100-miler,"" she said.In preparation for Japan, Ashwini trained extensively. ""I was already preparing for a 100-miler in the US earlier this year. My weekly routine involved 70-90km of running, strength training at Invictus Performance Lab, and long weekend runs across different terrain. The team helped me work on uneven surfaces, muscle control, and injury prevention,"" she explained.One of her biggest mental boosts came during a training event — the Backyard Ultra — where runners completed 6.7km every hour until only one remained. Ashwini clocked 28 hours and 187.8km, setting an Indian women's record. ""It helped me mentally prepare for Japan — how to manage fuel, push through fatigue, and stay calm under pressure.""According to Ashwini, her family was her biggest support system. ""My husband and in-laws were incredibly supportive throughout this journey. My mother-in-law manages things at home when I'm away training or racing. It's been 14 years since I got married, and their encouragement means the world to me.""""With this accomplishment, I hope more women feel inspired to prioritise their health and take care of themselves. It's my wish to see more of us on the trails and in ultrarunning — because women are born with an unlimited supply of endurance. It's just about discovering our abilities,"" she added.","Ashwini Ganapathi, a 39-year-old endurance athlete and coach from Karnataka, completed the Deep Japan Ultra 100 in 45 hours and 42 minutes.

Minnesota Wild re-sign forward Michael Milne hoping for breakout NHL scoring in 2025–26

Michael Milne’s journey from AHL standout to NHL debut with Minnesota Wild

The Minnesota Wild are doubling down on internal development for the 2025–26 season, officially signing 22-year-old forward Michael Milne to a one-year, two-way contract worth $775,000 at the NHL level and $100,000 in the AHL. The announcement on July 11, 2025, reflects the organization’s growing confidence in Milne’s readiness to contribute after his first NHL appearance last season. Born in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Milne fought through injuries to make his debut at St. Paul’s Xcel Energy Center on November 16, 2024. Now, with the ink dry on this new deal, the Wild are giving the gritty scorer every chance to carve out a bigger role.Michael Milne’s hockey story is one of resilience and persistence across Canada and the U.S. Selected 155th overall in the 2017 WHL Bantam Draft by the Kootenay Ice, he began with a quiet rookie campaign before exploding with the Winnipeg Ice. His best junior season came in 2021–22, where he racked up 38 goals and 81 points, showcasing the offensive touch that eventually got Minnesota’s attention.Drafted by the Minnesota Wild in the third round (89th overall) of the 2022 NHL Entry Draft, Milne signed his three-year entry-level deal in October that same year.He launched his professional career with the Iowa Wild in the American Hockey League in 2022, steadily proving his worth over three seasons. In 157 AHL games through 2025, Milne delivered 60 points (30 goals, 30 assists) and seven power-play goals, while also tallying nearly 300 shots on net.The 2024–25 season didn’t begin smoothly for Milne. Injuries forced him to miss both Wild rookie camp and main training camp, delaying his chance to prove himself in front of Minnesota’s NHL staff. When he finally returned to Iowa’s lineup, he wasted no time making an impact: four goals and eight points in his first ten games earned him a call-up to the big club.He made his NHL debut on November 16, 2024, against the Dallas Stars in St. Paul, skating on the fourth line with Jakub Lauko and Marat Khusnutdinov. Reflecting on that milestone in Des Moines later that week, Milne said: “That start to the season was huge for me. I just wanted to prove I was ready to go.”Wild President of Hockey Operations and General Manager Bill Guerin, speaking at Xcel Energy Center after the signing announcement, praised Milne’s effort and upside: “Michael’s a player who really earned that first NHL game. He’s tough, works hard, and has the kind of scoring touch we think can keep growing.”Now, with a fresh one-year contract in hand, Michael Milne is set to fight for a permanent spot on Minnesota’s 2025–26 roster. For a team trying to balance veteran leadership with homegrown talent, Milne’s development symbolizes the Wild’s strategy of building from within. If he can translate his AHL scoring grit into consistent NHL production, he might just become the breakout threat fans in Minnesota have been waiting for.Also Read: Toronto Marlies Sign Gunnarwolfe Fontaine, Ben King, Nick Rheaume in bold roster revamp","Minnesota Wild re-sign forward Michael Milne hoping for breakout NHL scoring in 2025–26 season. 22-year-old forward signed one-year, two-way contract worth $775,000 at the NHL level and $100,000 in the AHL.

Charlotte Flair Hints at Acquiring the Women’s World Title After Naomi’s Iconic Money in the Bank Cash-In at Evolution 2,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/charlotte-flair-hints-at-acquiring-the-womens-world-title-after-naomis-iconic-money-in-the-bank-cash-in-at-evolution-2/articleshow/122428166.cms,"Image via WWE

Charlotte Flair Shares Naomi Holding the World Title on X

Evolution 2 proved to be a banger, and it is safe to say that the company’s decision to put Rhea Ripley vs. Iyo Sky last on the card paid off. For almost 25 minutes, the two veterans kept the high-paced action going with big moves piled up one after the other. Moreover, WWE has constantly pushed the storyline of Ripley never getting the better of Sky, and so ‘Mami’ was hellbent on destroying the Women’s World Champion and slaying her for good.In the dying moments of the match, Sky accidentally missle drop-kicked the referee with Ripley scoring a visual pinfall. However, the carnage continued outside the ring, where Sky executed a beautiful cross-body. The duo returned to the ring, and with the referee once again in motion, Sky connected with the moonsault for a razor-close kickout. While the two wrestlers lay on the floor, Naomi entered the fray for vengeance!The Women’s Money in the Bank contract winner ran to the ring to capitalise and immediately hit Sky with her finishing move to win the gold. And it seems that the veteran members of the locker room have taken notice. Among the first to subtly congratulate Naomi on her victory was Charlotte Flair. The 14-time Women’s Champion took to her X account to post Naomi’s picture holding her newly won Women’s World title. However, it could also mean that Naomi is next on The Queen's hit list, as she has been looking to win her 15th title for a long time.Despite losing to Jade Cargill earlier in the night in a No Holds Barred bout, Naomi took advantage to claim the belt for herself.Many fans were bummed to see the new World Champion taking a second consecutive loss to Cargill this year. However, what followed in the main event was comparable to the ending of WrestleMania 31 when Seth Rollins cashed in his briefcase to beat Brock Lesnar and Roman Reigns. In the same way, Naomi also capitalized by making a singles contest a triple threat and pinning the champ to etch her name in the history books.Naomi has consistently been the workhorse of the women’s division, and fans are certainly delighted to witness the veteran win her 3rd Women’s title in the WWE. For the unversed, Naomi turned heel earlier this year in February and was revealed to be the one who attacked Cargill.And with the switch, she brought in a new wave of emotion to her character, and although she lost at WrestleMania 41, her push for the Money in the Bank win was built strongly. Now heading into SummerSlam, it will be interesting to see her feud with both Ripley and Sky for the gold.Also read: WWE Evolution 2025 Quick Highlights: List of All Winners, Top Performers, and More","Charlotte Flair Shares Naomi Holding the World Title on X account.

Poll Do you believe this incident will ignite more drama in the remaining matches? Definitely Maybe Unlikely

TimesofIndia.com in London: A hundred, two gritty half-centuries, an excellent run-out and a fiery spell with the ball was not enough as it was six minutes of unadulterated drama in the dying stages of Day 3 which brought the Lord's to life. A fired-up India captain Shubman Gill was in England opener Zak Crawley 's face and had almost every Indian player converging towards the pitch during that moment.The umpires intervened to cool things down but the damage had been done. Gill had enough of the theatrics and the call for the physio was the moment he exploded. After a round of applause, he charged towards Crawley and did an impact player signal, and also fired some not so pleasant statements with aggressive hand gestures.The stump mic was alert enough to pick up the four words which went viral on social media. ""Show some fu*g b**s,"" yelled Gill as the right-hander did all he could to deny India an over from the pavilion end. He succeeded and Jasprit Bumrah , equally annoyed, stood on top of his run-up for the final delivery of the day's play.He bowled an absolute peach but Crawley survived. The opener immediately turned back and was brisk walking to the dressing room as the umpires flipped the bails to signal end of day's play.A good old fashioned Day 3 got a spicy finish and has now set-up the remaining two days, and the series very nicely.The series hasn't had any dramatic moment yet and the episode on the third day could well fire up proceedings, and lend some flavor and colour to action. Both camps were asked about the final over and KL Rahul understood why Crawley was doing what he did, and also explained why Gill was so fired in those few minutes.""I am an opener so I can understand what he was doing but Shubman Gill was fired up because we wanted to bowl two overs in the six minutes before stumps. Lot of theatrics and everyone was fired up,"" said Rahul at post-day presser.From the hosts camp, Tim Southee, part of the coaching set-up, felt this is part and parcel of the game, and reiterated both sides have played in the right spirit in the series so far.",Shubman Gill and Jasprit Bumrah lost their cool in last five minutes of Day 3 vs England.

Mavericks coach Jason Kidd and Mark Cuban speak highly of their star rookie Cooper Flagg

Despite losing against the San Antonio Spurs, Dallas Mavericks star rookie Cooper Flagg managed to steal the show with his impressive performance. He went on to contribute 31 points on 10-21 as a point forward. Flagg competed point-to-point against San Antonio Spurs’ Dylan Harper during the game, who secured 16 points on 5-of-12 shooting. According to a recent report by a reputed media outlet, Mavericks coach Jason Kidd and Mark Cuban are quite confident about Cooper Flagg’s potential and strongly believe that with time he will fit into the team roster.According to reputed media outlet The Athletic’s Kelly Iko and Jared Weiss, Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd and Mark Cuban have full faith in their newly minted star Cooper Flagg. The 18-year-old basketball athlete has been generating waves even before he was drafted by Dallas Mavericks for the upcoming NBA season. As reported by Jared Weis, Jason Kidd said,""We're looking at being unselfish, playing hard and playing the game the right way. When you talk about stock, we're looking at those things. We're not worried about makes and misses. Just making the right play. Oh, he's gonna fit right in. He's gonna be fine. He'll be perfect.""Whereas Mark Cuban mentioned""He's big. People don't realize that. And he's not just tall; he's thick. And he's only 18—he can still be growing and could end up being 7 feet tall for all we know. But he's not some skinny, wiry guy. He's physical, athletic.Might not be the quickest guy in the NBA, but for his size, he's going to be up there in that combination.""During the recent face-off against Spurs, Flagg went on to grab four rebounds along with perfectly handling the ball. He even shot 13 free throws while playing through contact. During his debut game against the Los Angeles Lakers, Cooper Flagg said,“I think I've been solid. I'm exhausted. I'm not used to bringing the ball up like that. I had somebody on my hip every time I brought the ball up the court 94 feet. I think I did a solid job of bringing it up against pressure and setting up different actions.""At 6'9"", his blend of size, athleticism, and ball-handling ability is bound to create major problems for opposing defenses. Mark Cuban also noted that Flagg is stepping into a far better situation than most top draft picks. With established stars like Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, Klay Thompson, and D’Angelo Russell on the roster, the Mavericks are clearly aiming to contend right away in the competitive Western Conference.Also Read: ""I'm so proud of you”- Cooper Flagg’s mother turns emotional after he was drafted number one in the 2025 NBA draft","Mavericks coach Jason Kidd and Mark Cuban speak highly of their star rookie Cooper Flagg.

Triple H Says Seth Rollins’ Injury Is Still Inconclusive

At the 40th edition of Saturday Night’s Main Event, the injury bug was back in business. And this time, it bit Seth Rollins. In his co-main event outing against LA Knight, ‘The Architect’ performed a Lionsault off the second rope and landed awkwardly on his feet. That was it for the Money in the Bank briefcase holder. Rollins clutched his leg in visible pain and dragged himself to the corner of the ring, talking to Paul Heyman, the ringside doctor, and the referee.Just moments later, Knight picked up the win after a new finish was planned on the spot. Many media outlets reported that Rollins’ injury was legitimate and that he would be out for a considerable amount of time. And it seems that the reports are true. WWE CCO Triple H gave the fans an update on Rollins and his knee injury.At the post-event presser after Evolution 2, Triple H addressed the media and informed that Rollins’ knee injury was still inconclusive and that the former WWE Champion would undergo an MRI scan on July 14 to have more clarity about his situation.“And I’m sure somebody here would ask about Seth. I would say a little bit inconclusive. Doesn’t look good. We’re in Birmingham tomorrow. He came here tonight, he was not going to miss his wife’s [Becky Lynch] performance tonight.He was here, and he’ll be in Birmingham tomorrow with Dr. (Jeffrey) Dugas. We’ll get an MRI, hope for the best, and see where we can go with that.”Rollins’ wife, Becky Lynch, defended her Women’s Intercontinental title against Bayley and Lyra Valkyria at Evolution 2, and ‘The Architect’ wouldn’t miss it for sure. However, Fightful reported that Rollins was seen on crutches backstage at the event, which points to a more grim situation.Moreover, Rollins has had issues with the same right knee. In November 2015, Rollins tore his ACL, MCL, and Meniscus during a house show in Dublin against Kane, forcing him to relinquish his WWE title and miss WrestleMania 32. If the injury is bad, then Rollins may have to miss this year’s 2-night SummerSlam, which will definitely prove to be a big bummer considering how his heel run has caught the attention of the WWE universe.Also read: WWE Evolution 2025 Quick Highlights: List of All Winners, Top Performers, and More",Triple H says Seth Rollins’ knee injury is still inconclusive. ‘The Architect’ performed a Lionsault off the second rope and landed awkwardly on his feet.
