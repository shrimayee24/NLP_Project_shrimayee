Poll Will RCB secure a top-two finish in IPL 2025? Yes No

'Chances are still there': Abishek Porel believes in IPL 2025 playoff miracle

NEW DELHI: Already assured of a playoff spot, Royal Challengers Bengaluru will look to secure a top-two finish in the league stage for the first time since 2016 when they take on Sunrisers Hyderabad in their IPL 2025 clash on Friday. The last time RCB finished in the top two was during the 2016 season, which saw them end up as runners-up.Currently second on the points table with 17 points from 12 matches, RCB can potentially seal a top-two berth with wins in their remaining two fixtures.Friday’s encounter, which was initially slated as a home game for RCB, had to be shifted due to the arrival of the monsoon season.Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra weighed in on the conditions expected at the new venue — the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow — and predicted a low-scoring contest.“Don’t expect a high-scoring game – Ekana won’t allow it. It’s a big ground, not Chinnaswamy. But it’ll still be a good contest. Don’t count out SRH. That said, the dice is loaded in favor of the team Virat Kohli plays for,” Chopra said on the JioHotstar Network.He further shared his thoughts on the playoff race. “A change is coming. RCB vs PBKS – I think one of them drops a game. MI vs PBKS is also crucial. Don’t rule out SRH – they beat LSG and have game-changers.One big innings, like Marsh’s today, can shake things up. I won’t be surprised if the top four look completely different,” he said.RCB’s form has been bolstered by the outstanding run of Virat Kohli, who has struck seven half-centuries in 11 innings, providing consistent starts at the top.The team was riding a four-match winning streak before the league was disrupted due to the India-Pakistan military conflict. However, their return match after a 20-day hiatus was washed out, halting their momentum. It remains to be seen if they can recapture the rhythm and intensity that marked their pre-break performances.Chasing a long-awaited IPL title, RCB are enjoying one of their most consistent seasons in recent years.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru will look to secure a top-two finish in the league stage for the first time since 2016.

Why the Los Angeles Lakers Would Do It

Why the Warriors Would Consider It

Theandare under pressure to make big moves this offseason. After disappointing playoff exits, both teams face tough decisions—and a surprising trade involvingcould be on the table.According to Colin Keane of Sporting News , the Warriors, led by Stephen Curry , Draymond Green, and Jimmy Butler, fell short in the Conference Semifinals against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Their lack of depth and youth was exposed, signaling a need for fresh talent.Built on LeBron James and Luka Doncic, the Lakers also had defensive issues and lost to the Timberwolves in the first round. The front staff has been compelled to explore significant retooling due to their roster imbalance.Here’s the potential deal that could shake up both franchises: Draymond Green (4-time All-Star, defensive anchor)- Dalton Knecht (young sharpshooting wing)- Rui Hachimura (expiring contract)- 2031 first-round draft pick LeBron James , now 40, is still elite, but the Los Angeles Lakers must maximize their championship window.Draymond Green’s defensive versatility and playmaking would immediately elevate their roster.- Defensive Upgrade: Green’s ability to guard multiple positions fixes a major Lakers weakness.- Leadership: His vocal presence and playoff experience would bolster the locker room.- Win-Now Move: Knecht’s potential doesn’t align with the Lakers’ urgency to contend.As writer Colin Keane noted: ""Green would be heartbroken to trade in his Warriors uniform and go somewhere else, but his positive relationship with LeBron has been well-documented.""According to Colin, trading Draymond Green would be emotional, but the Golden State Warriors must plan for life after Curry.- Future Assets: Knecht and the 2031 pick offer long-term upside.- Financial Flexibility: Hachimura’s expiring deal clears future cap space.- Youth Movement: Green’s departure accelerates a rebuild around younger talent.While this specific trade might not be enough, the Warriors should keep an open mind if better offers emerge.Both teams are at a crossroads. The Los Angeles Lakers get a proven winner in Draymond Green, while the Golden State Warriors secure assets for the future. Whether this deal happens or not, one thing is clear: major changes are coming for these franchises.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors could eye $70 million Boston Celtics point guard to boster squad after unfortunate playoff exit This trade scenario remains speculative, but it highlights the tough choices ahead for both teams.

Tony Romo weighs in on the Travis Kelce-Taylor Swift phenomenon



Tony Romo believes Travis Kelce 's relationship with Taylor Swift is beneficial, asserting ""he’s probably doing less than he used to when he was younger."" Romo suggests the increased media attention masks a quieter lifestyle, arguing, ""it can be a net positive if you look at it closely. ""Former Dallas Cowboys quarterback and current CBS Sports analyst, Tony Romo, offers a unique perspective on the highly publicized relationship between Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and pop superstar Taylor Swift. Far from viewing it as a distraction, Romo contends that the high-profile romance is a ""net positive"" for Kelce, both professionally and personally.Tony Romo, 45, who himself experienced the spotlight dating Jessica Simpson during his NFL career, suggests that the public perception of Kelce's social life might be misleading. ""People won’t even realize this, but he’s probably doing less than he used to when he was younger,” Romo exclusively told Us Weekly. He elaborates that the frequent photographs of Kelce and Swift dining out merely capture a routine activity, akin to a married couple.“If you get your picture taken going to dinner with your superstar girlfriend, it looks like you’re going out or something. No, he just went to dinner. Almost as if he’s married, going to dinner with his wife or something.He didn’t get photographed when he was going out with his buddies all the time.”According to Tom Romo, the increased media coverage actually belies a more settled existence for the athlete. “He’s far less out there. He’s doing far less things than when he was younger. It’s just the fact that if you’re written about a lot and it’s not about football, some people are always going to think that it plays a role. But the truth is that it can be a net positive if you look at it closely.”Addressing Travis Kelce's statistically modest 2024 season, which saw career lows in touchdowns and receptions, Romo believes it was a natural adjustment to the intense scrutiny. “That was his first whole season being under that microscope,” Romo noted, referencing the start of their relationship in September 2023. “It was the first full season and offseason where the public and the world knew. Like anybody, we all learn through experience and we get wiser. ”Romo expresses full confidence in Kelce's ability to navigate this new level of fame, drawing parallels to his own experiences. “Not that [Kelce] has to do anything,” Romo explained.“The guy is a [future] Hall of Famer who has played at the highest level. He’s won Super Bowls. He’s made some of the biggest plays in the most clutch situations ever. I think he’ll figure things out real quick, even if there was something to figure out. I think everyone should just put their trust in him.” He concluded by adding, “And I think he’s got himself a wonderful, wonderful girlfriend.”On a personal note, Romo, now a father of three, embraces a busy family life, finding comfort and convenience in his Skechers Hands Free Slip-ins®. “Me and my wife are taxi cab drivers these days,” Romo joked.“Going from practice to practice to pickup to games. It’s a blast. It’s really one of the great times in my life doing all of this. That’s where Skechers works because I have the slip-on shoe and can be like, ‘Oh, gotta go to the next one. Oh! Didn’t realize we had another one. Slip it on and go.’”Also Read: Did Travis Kelce just confirm he’s living with Taylor Swift?

Fans celebrate Jim Irsay’s city-wide legacy during Indianapolis’ ultimate weekend of sports and community pride,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/fans-celebrate-jim-irsays-city-wide-legacy-during-indianapolis-ultimate-weekend-of-sports-and-community-pride/articleshow/121372282.cms,"Indianapolis turns into a sports paradise as Jim Irsay’s influence echoes across the entire city (Getty Images)

Jim Irsay’s imprint turns Indianapolis into a vibrant hub of sports, music, and community spirit



Indianapolis is buzzing this Memorial Day weekend. From the roar of engines at the Indianapolis 500 to packed arenas cheering for the Indiana Pacers and WNBA’s Indiana Fever, the city has become a living testament to the dream one man helped build. As fans crowd the streets, it’s impossible to ignore the absence of Jim Irsay, the longtime Indianapolis Colts owner who passed away in his sleep at 65. His vision didn’t just transform a football franchise — it reshaped an entire city’s identity.Irsay arrived in Indianapolis in 1984, when the Colts made their dramatic midnight move from Baltimore. Back then, the city had yet to step into the sports limelight. The downtown area was a quiet place with little to offer beyond Market Square Arena. But Irsay saw more than just potential; he saw possibility. And in the decades that followed, his influence would stretch far beyond the gridiron.Mark Miles, CEO of IndyCar and Penske Entertainment, who has worked hand-in-hand with Irsay on countless city initiatives, captured the sentiment of many: “It’s incredibly sad, it’s a big ache in my heart… this weekend is sort of emblematic of what he helped build and I’m sorry he missed it,” according to AP.Indeed, this weekend isn’t just a spectacle — it’s a culmination of a vision that started with a football team and blossomed into a multi-sport renaissance. Saturday’s sold-out Fever game, headlined by rising star Caitlin Clark, Sunday morning’s Indianapolis 500 with over 350,000 expected fans, and Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals between the Pacers and the Knicks that same night all point back to the groundwork laid by Irsay.And his impact wasn’t confined to just owning a football team. “He was more than the owner of the Indianapolis Colts, he was a transformative figure in our city and state, a passionate advocate for the community,” said Indiana Pacers owner Herb Simon. “Jim helped shape our city into the sports capital it is today, and his legacy, both on and off the field, will continue to inspire us and generations to come.”During the early 2000s, as stadium talks heated up, Irsay never once threatened to leave Indianapolis. That unwavering loyalty spoke volumes. Miles, who also led the 1987 Pan Am Games and later the Super Bowl XLVI organizing committee, acknowledged that without Irsay’s backing, neither event would have found a home in Indy. “We would never have had a Super Bowl without Jim Irsay, without the Colts or Jim Irsay’s passion or commitment to getting it here and that never really wavered. ”Even in his final days, Irsay remained connected to the city’s heartbeat. His last tweet was a nod to another Indy sports team — a small but telling moment that reflected a man who genuinely loved the community he helped elevate.His daughter, Casey Irsay Foyt, will now carry the torch as she steps onto the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to serve as honorary starter for Sunday’s race. Along with her sisters, she represents not just the next chapter of Colts ownership but the continuation of a family deeply embedded in the city's cultural fabric.“To have his death heading into this epic sports weekend has us pausing to reflect on just how categorically he changed and enhanced the city’s skyline,” said Chris Gahl of Visit Indy. “That’s the culture he helped put in place in our city.”Jim Irsay didn’t just bring football to Indianapolis — he brought heart, ambition, and a vision that turned Indiana No Place into Indiana Some Place. And this weekend, every cheer, every footstep, and every celebration echoes his legacy.Also Read: Fans convinced Taylor Swift may move in with Travis Kelce after his luxurious Florida mansion hint","Jim Irsay’s imprint turns Indianapolis into a vibrant hub of sports, music, and community spirit.

Reinhart ’s injury threatens Florida Panthers’ Stanley Cup hopes



The Florida Panthers grabbed a commanding 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference Final with a dominant 5-0 win over the Hurricanes. But what should’ve been a perfect night took a sharp turn when star forward Sam Reinhart exited with an injury. As one of Florida’s top playoff performers, his absence now raises serious doubts about the team’s momentum just as they inch closer to the Stanley Cup Final.Sam Reinhart, the offensive engine behind Florida’s deep playoff push, exited Game 2 early after a heavy hit from Sebastian Aho left his left leg bent unnaturally near the blue line. Though he briefly returned to the bench, Reinhart was clearly in pain and didn’t step back onto the ice for the remainder of the game. This injury comes at a critical moment, Reinhart had been on fire throughout the postseason, tallying 11 points in 13 games, including key contributions in the Panthers’ first-round sweep of Tampa Bay.The exact severity of Reinhart’s injury remains unclear as the Panthers await medical evaluations, with head coach Paul Maurice stating, “We'll get him looked at Friday. We'll get an update Saturday.” This cautious approach reflects the serious nature of the situation and the uncertainty surrounding how soon, or if, Reinhart will return to the lineup.Losing Reinhart’s scoring prowess and playmaking ability could seriously disrupt Florida’s offensive flow, especially with the Hurricanes desperate to claw back into the series. Florida has obliterated Carolina’s defense in the first two games, outscoring them 10-2 and showcasing a balance of scoring from stars like Matthew Tkachuk, Aleksander Barkov, and even role players such as Sam Bennett, who netted two goals in Game 2.Also Read: Jordan Staal criticizes Hurricanes’ performance after devastating game 2 loss to Florida Panthers The Panthers’ strong start may hide a fragile truth, if Reinhart’s injury keeps him out, Florida’s offense could lose its edge.

Mike Tomlin has been the head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers since 2007. During all these years, he never had a losing season, which is very rare in the NFL. Nevertheless, he has never received the NFL Coach of the Year award. Numerous individuals within the football community now think that 2025 may be the year Mike Tomlin will at last receive that recognition. Next season is not shaping up to be an easy one for the Steelers , but that might just benefit Mike Tomlin's argument.This season, the Pittsburgh Steelers are not regarded as a strong team by most analysts. This past May of 2025, prior to the season beginning, analysts on NFL Network and ESPN were forecasting that the Pittsburgh Steelers could only go 9-8 this season.The team made some puzzling moves during the offseason. They traded wide receiver Diontae Johnson on March 12, 2025, for draft picks in the future. They did not bring in a definitive top quarterback either, though Aaron Rodgers rumors were the talk in early April.In spite of this, Mike Tomlin is unshaken. At a press conference on May 5, 2025, in Pittsburgh, he stated, ""Every season has new challenges. That's part of the job.But I believe in this group.""His optimism has players and fans anxiously observing.

Auston Matthews’ hockey dream wasn’t cheap and his mom took the weight

“I used to work in the morning for Starbucks, in the afternoon the restaurant, i was very fortunate to have two jobs. And believe me, if they would have more hours, I would have more jobs.""





Before Auston Matthews was an NHL superstar, his biggest supporter was clocking into two jobs, trying to make ends meet. His mom, Ema Matthews, didn’t just believe in his dream, she bankrolled it, penny by penny, from behind a Starbucks counter. For families without deep pockets, hockey can be financially brutal. But Ema’s resilience turned obstacles into opportunity and her son into one of the league’s brightest stars. Her story is the heartwarming reminder that every great athlete often has a real-life superhero cheering from the sidelines, sacrificing, hustling, and holding it all together so their child can chase the impossible.Ice time, gear, coaching, travel, youth hockey isn’t just a sport, it’s a financial beast. For the Matthews family, especially with Ema being originally from Hermosillo, Mexico, the culture and cost of the sport were both daunting. But she took on the challenge without hesitation, picking up multiple jobs including a gig at Starbucks to ensure Auston never missed a chance to grow on the ice.Ema shared in a past interview that the cost of hockey often reached up to $20,000 a year, a heavy ask for any middle-class family. To make it work, she didn’t just cut corners, she picked up shifts and poured lattes while helping Auston stay focused on the sport. She even deposited small amounts of money in his account so he could grab food with teammates like a regular teen.Ema’s story also breaks stereotypes. In a sport dominated by players from Canada and northern U.S. states, Auston’s rise as a player of Mexican heritage makes his success even more impactful. It's not just about talent, it’s about trailblazing, especially for kids of color or immigrant families who rarely see themselves represented in hockey.Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL. He’s not just known for his goal-scoring skills but also for his poise and work ethic, traits his mom likely helped instill. While fans celebrate his success on the ice, stories like Ema’s remind us of the sacrifices behind the scenes that made it possible.Ema Matthews’ story shows what’s possible when love, grit, and hustle lead the way.Also read - “From baptism to strip club”: Pete Blackburn’s unhinged NHL comparison is going viral and fans totally get it","Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL.

Spoiler: it's not about wellness or strength.Reflecting on the early days of her relationship with Matthew, which began back in college at the University of Georgia, Kelly jokingly pointed to her hair, specifically her signature messy bun as the feature that first caught his eye. But Winchester wasn’t buying it. He recalled a past conversation with Matthew and asked Kelly if she remembered what the NFL star really noticed first.With zero hesitation, Kelly replied, “My ass.”Confirming the claim, Winchester said, “That booty.” And Kelly doubled down: “That’s why I’m constantly in the gym right now—making sure the booty, among other things, looks better. All I do is legs and ass. That’s it.”Her unfiltered honesty immediately set off waves of reactions online.

LeBron James clinched a historic milestone, surpassing Michael Jordan



The 40-year-old LeBron James is still making waves in the NBA. In his 22nd season, the Los Angeles Lakers star achieved a feat no player, not even Michael Jordan , had accomplished. He became the oldest player in league history to receive regular-season MVP votes. Although the Lakers are officially out of the playoffs, James is not done making history in his name.This historic milestone of LeBron James came after LeBron finished sixth in the 2024–25 MVP race, a remarkable result considering his age and the sheer depth of competition this season. While Shai Gilgeous-Alexander rightfully earned the award, with 913 total points, and Nikola Jokic and Giannis Antetokounmpo rounded out the top three, James quietly edged past younger superstars like Stephen Curry, Anthony Edwards, and Jalen Brunson to claim a top-six finish. His final tally of 16 MVP points came from one fourth-place vote and several fifth-place nods.It wasn’t the most dominant statistical season of his career, but LeBron’s impact on the Lakers remained undeniable. Averaging 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 8.2 assists over 70 games, he led the Lakers to the third seed in the Western Conference. His elite-level gameplay is still hard to ignore.In the historical context, Michael Jordan, considered by many as the greatest of all time, previously held the record for being the oldest player to receive MVP votes, aged 39 years and 3 months, during his stint with the Washington Wizards in the 2001–02 season.LeBron, now 40 years and 4 months old, has surpassed that mark.LeBron James is now both the youngest (19 years, 4 months) and oldest (40 years, 4 months) player in NBA history to receive MVP votes. He first earned MVP recognition during his rookie season in 2003–04, finishing sixth with 93 points behind Steve Nash.Also Read: LeBron James' agent on Los Angeles Lakers star's future: ""It's not the physical aspect, it's where you're at mentally"" Of course, it was another great feat of the Lakers legend, directly standing in line with NBA icon Jordan. James seemingly has one or more seasons in his sleeves, and many records will be added to his name, making him one of the greatest of all time, if not the greatest. Despite retirement rumors after this season, James is holding on to his career as he dismissed the rumor.","LeBron James became the oldest player in NBA history to receive MVP votes.

Zoey Stark’s injury overshadows Rhea Ripley’s MITB victory

WWE Superstar Zoey Stark made her comeback to the limelight in a tragic manner on the recent episode of Monday Night RAW. What was supposed to be a critical milestone in her career, Stark got severely injured in her knee in a triple-threat qualifying match for the 2025 Women's Money in the Bank (MITB) ladder match. The incident has not only sidelined her from one of WWE’s most prestigious events but may also signal a prolonged absence from in-ring competition.The accident occurred at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, South Carolina, during a MITB qualifier bout between Zoey Stark, Kairi Sane, and Rhea Ripley. At its climax, Stark tried her characteristic springboard dropkick—a sportslike move that requires agility and accuracy. In targeting Kairi Sane, Stark slipped in executing the springboard, resulting in her awkwardly landing on her right leg.The blow caused her knee to bend in a distinctly unnatural manner, quite visibly startling both supporters and commentators. The match instantly became secondary as paramedics rushed onto the field to treat the hurt athlete. After the botched maneuver, Stark fell to the floor, cradling her right knee and exhibiting obvious signs of pain and distress. The referee stopped the match for a moment and motioned for medical attention. WWE ringside physicians made their way into the ring and evaluated her condition.Despite the extent of the injury, Stark first tried to leave the ring independently. She tried to stand, only to fall again, as she could no longer bear the weight of herself. Eventually, she was assisted backstage by medical personnel, affirming the severity of the ordeal.Veteran WWE play-by-play commentator Michael Cole guessed on-air that Stark may have re-aggravated an old injury. Stark had extensive knee surgery in 2021 to repair a torn ACL, MCL, and meniscus—injuries requiring months of rehabilitation.With the visual similarity and reaction of Stark, there is an increasing fear that her current injury is a recurrence or exacerbation of the same condition of the knee. But to date, WWE has not issued a formal medical diagnosis or recovery timeline. The wrestling fraternity came in support of Stark after the injury. AEW wrestler Thunder Rosa showed her concern with a heartfelt post on social media:""Wrestling is a lovely and risky sport. We leave everything on the table every time we go to the ring, and we also put a lot on the line when we do what we are passionate about. Zoey Stark, I love you, sister, and I hope that you heal soon."" — Thunder Rosa through X (previously Twitter)Zoey Stark's RAW match was her first on television since January. She had last remained an active member of the dissolved faction Pure Fusion Collective, after Sonya Deville and Shayna Baszler left. Stark was competing mainly in non-televised WWE house shows and sporadic Main Event tapings before this return.As a result of her earlier knee damage incurred during her stint in NXT, Stark was drafted to the main roster as part of the 2023 WWE Draft—a testament to how much the WWE believed in her promising future. The MITB qualifier was set to be a career-launching experience, which made her untimely injury so much more heartbreaking.With Stark out, the match went on between the remaining participants. Rhea Ripley took advantage of the situation, overpowering Kairi Sane and finishing the match with her characteristic Riptide finisher. The pinfall win earned Ripley a spot in the upcoming ladder match for Women's Money in the Bank, which is to be held on June 7. Ripley’s victory, however, was overshadowed by the concern surrounding Stark’s health, as WWE fans and analysts alike shifted focus to the severity of the injury.The extent of Stark’s injury remains unconfirmed by WWE, leaving her return date unknown. Given her history of severe knee damage, fans and medical experts fear that she could face another lengthy recovery process. This injury not only removes her from one of WWE’s most career-defining matches but also risks stalling the momentum she had just begun to regain. For now, Zoey Stark’s fans—and the WWE Universe as a whole—await official word from WWE’s medical team.","WWE superstar Zoey Stark suffers a painful knee injury during MITB qualifier match.

Poll Who was the standout player for Sunrisers Hyderabad in their match against RCB? Ishan Kishan Heinrich Klaasen Travis Head Pat Cummins

Sunrisers Hyderabad took to the pitch on Friday knowing well that a win will not change their standing in the table. The game however, had the potential to help Royal Challengers Bengaluru solidify their claim to booking a top-two spot ahead of the playoffs. Travis Head and Abhshek Sharma opened the game for SRH, although the RCB bowling attack took their wickets before either of them could put up a dangerous score on the board.Travis Head was dismissed for 17 by Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Abhishek Sharma fell at 34 thanks, after being caught by Phil Salt from a Lungi Ngidi delivery. While RCB mustered confidence from their dismissals, along came Ishan Kishan to spoil the party. A man down, Kishan did spectacularly well, as he dispatched boundary after boundary in the balls that followed.His tailblazing 94 from just 48 deliveries changed the game for Sunrisers as they put up a massive 231 runs on the board. Besides Kishan, Heinrich Klaasen and Aniket Verman put up brilliant cameos, adding another 50 runs in just 22 balls for SRH. Nitish Kumar Reddy, Abhinav Manohar and Pat Cummins also featured for SRH at the crease as they put up a total RCB had never chased before in the IPL . 232 from 120 deliveries was 206/1 against the Gujarat Titans in 2024.RCB took to the crease with Virat Kohli and Phil Salt opening the chase. While Kohli showed intent early on with his boundaries, he was dismissed while at 43 by Harsh Dubey. His opening partner Phil Salt marhed on for a bit more, racking up 62 runs in 32 deliveries.However, his dismissal by Pat Cummins, followed by the successive wickets of Mayank Agarwal, Rajat Patidar and Jitesh Sharma marked the starting of RCB's collapse. What followed was Bengaluru wickets falling like dominoes; not a single player that came in afterwards stood at the crease for more than 6 balls. With victory in sight, SRH bowlers showed no mercy to RCB.The Jitesh Sharma led squad was bowled out at 189, earning SRH victory by 42 runs. The win does not affect SRH's position in the points table. They remain in 8th spot with 11 points, below Kolkata Knight Riders who have 12 in 13. As for RCB, their net run rate took a massive dive to +0.255, pushing them below Punjab Kings. Prior to the game on Friday, RCB were second, and a win would have put them closer to a top-two finish. Now, a win for PBKS and Mumbai Indians, who have 17 and 16 points respectively, will push them even more behind in the race for top-two.",Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Royal Challengers Bengaluru by 42 runs.

Poll Do you think Neeraj Chopra can consistently breach the 85m mark in future competitions? Yes, he will surpass it consistently No, he might struggle at times

Melbourne: Australian Open, MCG, Australian GP and lots more

NEW DELHI: India's Olympic and World Champion javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra delivered a gritty performance in tough weather conditions to secure second place at the Janusz Kusocinski Memorial meet in Poland on Friday. Battling cold and damp surroundings at the Silesian Stadium, Chopra saved his best for last — an 84.14m throw in his sixth and final attempt — to climb from third to second.It was a rare sub-85m outing for Chopra, who has consistently surpassed that benchmark in recent years. This was only the sixth time since his Tokyo Olympics gold in 2021 that Chopra failed to breach 85m in an event. He began with a foul and managed just 81.28m in his second attempt. Despite consulting coach Jan Zelezny mid-competition, Chopra continued to struggle, recording two more fouls and a fifth-round 81.40m before his final effort saved the day.Germany’s Julian Weber, Chopra’s familiar rival and winner in the recent Doha Diamond League, again outperformed the Indian with an 86.12m throw in the second round — the best of the night.Weber went on to produce two more 85m-plus throws (85.03m and 85.11m), emerging as the standout performer.Grenada’s Anderson Peters, a two-time world champion, took third with 83.24m, replicating the top-three order from Doha.All three podium finishers were below their season’s bests, with slippery run-ups and overcast skies affecting rhythm and grip. The meet saw only four throws above 85m — all by Weber.Chopra, who had breached the 90m mark for the first time last month, will now focus on upcoming competitions in Paris (Diamond League, June 20) and Ostrava (Golden Spike, June 24).","India's Olympic and World Champion javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra delivered a gritty performance in tough weather conditions to secure second place at the Janusz Kusocinski Memorial meet in Poland.

Dinamo Zagreb title slip chance might influence Luka Modrić towards Major League Soccer spell



DAY ONE OF GREATNESS: Luka Modric’s FIRST DAY at Real Madrid back in 2012

Luka Modrić, one of the most iconic midfielders in world football, is coming to the close of his illustrious career at Real Madrid—and his next stop may be on the Atlantic. With Dinamo Zagreb struggling to win the Croatian league championship, Major League Soccer clubs such as New York City FC and Los Angeles FC are making increased overtures to acquire the Croatian legend.As Luka Modrić bids farewell to Real Madrid after 13 incredible seasons and more than 20 top honors, his next possible transfer is generating interest far outside of Europe. While many Croatians dream of watching him return to Dinamo Zagreb, the club where he began, Luka Luka Modrić's next stop might actually be the United States and Major League Soccer. New York City FC is reported to be leading the pack, continuing its tradition of bringing in European anchors onto the MLS stage—Frank Lampard, Andrea Pirlo, and David Villa being some of the most notable. Los Angeles FC is also heavily rumored with the midfielder, where fellow countrymen Olivier Giroud and World Cup winner Hugo Lloris are recent signings.Timing might just be perfect, as the 2026 FIFA World Cup is set to be staged in the United States, Canada, and Mexico; this move could give Modrić the exposure and competitive tempo he needs.Back home, for Dinamo Zagreb, things are much less clear-cut. Dinamo's hope rests above all on winning the Croatian league championship—something not at all certain this season.Without it, both the club's negotiating strength and the sentimental attraction of a return diminish considerably.For Modrić, the choice probably tips sentimental worth versus pragmatic possibility. The return to Dinamo Zagreb would be celebrated as a victorious return home, but the opportunity to become an MLS marquee name in an era of explosive league expansion might prove too pragmatic to pass up.Also read: Luka Modric to leave Real Madrid after 13 years, nearly 600 appearances Whether Luka Modrić concludes his legendary career in the city where it started in Zagreb or sets the new chapter under the American spotlight, his next step will have global importance.

American tennis player Coco Gauff, 21, is looking to transform her recent runner-up disappointments in Madrid and Rome clay tournaments into motivation for the upcoming French Open in Paris, where she previously reached the finals in 2022 and won the doubles title last year.Gauff enters the French Open following consecutive finals losses to world number one Aryna Sabalenka and Italy's Jasmine Paolini in Roland Garros warm-up tournaments.The 2018 French Open junior champion will face 93rd-ranked Australian Olivia Gadecki in her opening match on the red clay surface.Reflecting on her 2022 French Open final loss to Iga Swiatek, Gauff said: ""I think immediately after it was a tough feeling for me. I just felt like maybe I could never overcome that. Then I just turned it into motivation. I knew that, I don't know, just had a deep-down gut (feeling) that I was going to be in a final position again. I was like, I'm not going to go out like that.

I feel like at that time I didn't gauge surfaces or anything. I felt like I should just be good at everything. I definitely think it's something that I'm comfortable on. I mainly credit it to me probably sliding a lot on a hard court so when I go on clay it just feels a lot easier.""Her recent clay court performances have boosted her confidence heading into Roland Garros.Regarding her clay season results, Gauff stated: ""It definitely gives me a lot of confidence, but I think I'm just putting those results in the past and focusing on the next two weeks here.""Last year, Gauff claimed the Roland Garros doubles title partnering with Katerina Siniakova, further cementing her credentials on the clay surface.","American tennis player Coco Gauff, 21, is looking to transform her recent runner-up disappointments in Madrid and Rome clay tournaments into motivation for the upcoming French Open in Paris.

Tyrese Haliburton's playoff heroics challenge Jalen Brunson 's Clutch Player of the Year title

Tyrese Haliburton has emerged as the NBA's latest clutch player, shining when it counts the most. Even Stephen A. Smith, a long-time doubter and passionate New York Knicks fan, had to acknowledge Haliburton's brilliance after Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals. The Indiana Pacers' point guard not only leveled the score at the buzzer but also demonstrated a level of poise that compelled Smith to reconsider his views. As Haliburton's playoff performances continue to impress, the conversation about his superstar credentials is really heating up.In the 2024–25 NBA season, Jalen Brunson of the New York Knicks took home the Clutch Player of the Year award, leading the league with 156 clutch points and a 51.5% shooting percentage in those critical moments. Meanwhile, Tyrese Haliburton's performances in the playoffs are making a solid case for his own clutch status. In Game 1 against the Knicks, Haliburton made a game-tying shot at the buzzer, which sent the game into overtime, where the Pacers won 138–135.Haliburton really shines when the pressure's on. This season, he's hit 12 out of 14 shots (86%) to either tie or take the lead in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime, which is the highest percentage since they started keeping track in 1996–97.Plus, during the 2025 playoffs, he's gone 5-for-6 (83.3%) in those clutch moments, tying for the most in a single postseason since 1997.Stephen A. Smith, initially critical of Haliburton, acknowledged the guard's clutch performances, stating, ""So, again, clutch time is different since you're talking about the last five minutes or so. But that last shot? After we've seen what he's done against Cleveland? When we saw what he's done against the New York Knicks? When we saw what he's done throughout these playoffs? Against Milwaukee? In these playoffs, Tyrese Haliburton has been money. "" He highlighted Haliburton's 47% shooting against tight defenses in the postseason, surpassing Brunson's 45%.Haliburton's journey through the playoffs has been highlighted by significant moments: a game-winning layup against the Milwaukee Bucks, an important three-pointer to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers, and now, a critical shot against the Knicks.

The night following WrestleMania 41, ""The Maverick"" made an impression by throwing a challenge at the just-crowned champion.After Uso successfully defended against Seth Rollins, Paul ambushed the champion, making his intentions crystal clear.It will be interesting to see if the Maverick takes home the title. Will Jey Uso's run for the championship continue? Or could this be the time that the WWE undergoes a huge change?At Saturday Night's Main Event 39, R-Truth will be taking center stage against his childhood hero, John Cena , in a match that has been building for years. Although they had a long history of friendship and respect for one another, things took an ugly turn at the WWE Backlash PLE Cena wasn't exactly appreciative when Truth unexpectedly interrupted his bout with Randy Orton, stopping The Viper from making a game-ending punt and thereby giving Cena the win. In this edition of Saturday Night’s Main Event, this segment is going to be undeniably emotional, a mix of admiration, betrayal, and long-standing history.CM Punk, Seth Rollins, Sami Zayn, and Bron Breakker kicked off the May 12th Monday Night Raw show with a brawl, where initially Rollins and Breakker took control, but the numbers game was neutralized as Sami Zayn appeared, followed by Jey Uso.While the tension between Rollins and Punk is brewing well and is known to all, Rollins’ recent attack on Zayn, who had turned down his offer, has backfired.

Tennis Fan Pope Leo XIV Meets With Italian Player Jannik Sinner, But 'Refuses' To Play With Him

Poll What do you think is the main reason for the excitement around Alcaraz vs. Sinner matches? High quality of tennis Their rivalry's intensity Their contrasting styles Both are fan favorites

Carlos Alcaraz, the reigning French Open champion, welcomed his growing rivalry with world number one Jannik Sinner ahead of Roland Garros 2025, stating it benefits tennis while preparing for a potential final showdown. The two players have dominated recent Grand Slams, sharing the last five major titles between them, with Alcaraz speaking at a pre-tournament press conference in Paris on Friday.Alcaraz and Sinner have established themselves as the dominant forces in men's tennis. Alcaraz claimed the French Open and Wimbledon titles last year, while Sinner secured his first major at the 2024 Australian Open, followed by the US Open and successfully defended his Melbourne title in January.""I think for the people, for the tennis fans, I think it's great to have a match-up from some players that make them excited about watching that match. Right now I think the people are excited every time that I'm facing Jannik. Our matches I think are a really high quality of tennis. I think for the people and probably the people who don't like watching tennis, I think (our rivalry) is something that because of that (they have) started to watch tennis.The 22-year-old Spaniard remained modest about the rivalry's historical significance. ""I'm not gonna put myself or the great rivalry that I have with Jannik at (the) same level as those legends. Let's see in the future how it's gonna be. Right now for sure I'm not going to put ourselves into that table of that rivalries, but I think people are excited about watching our matches.""Their most recent encounter at the Italian Open final showcased their competitive spirit. Despite Sinner's three-month doping suspension preceding the tournament, Alcaraz emerged victorious with a 7-6 (7/5), 6-1 win, ending the Italian's 26-match winning streak.Alcaraz's performance in Rome elevated him to world number two, securing his position as second seed at Roland Garros behind Sinner.In the first round, Alcaraz faces former world number four Kei Nishikori, currently ranked 62nd.""Honestly, I'm really excited about facing Nishikori for the first time. I'm watching him play a lot when I was young. I was really happy when he came back again on tour. I know that he has been struggling physically the last year, a lot of injuries that kept him away from playing. I know when he plays good tennis, (he's) really tough to beat. So I have to be ready for that, for the first round... I'm excited to play against a legend like Nishikori. ""","Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have dominated recent Grand Slams.

Travis Kelce's retirement plans can change thanks to this new NFL rule,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-kelces-retirement-plans-can-change-thanks-to-this-new-nfl-rule/articleshow/121368870.cms,"Will Travis Kelce play in the Olympics? Source: AP

Will Travis Kelce retire in 2026? Will he be a part of the Olympics?

It was recently announced that NFL owners approved a plan permitting league players to take part in the flag football event at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. The proposal stipulates that each team can have only one player participate in the event. Under the rules, only one player per NFL team can compete on each national team, and teams' designated international players will be allowed to play for their home countries.While Patrick Mahomes is largely believed to be the designated international player and will likely be a part of the Olympics, Travis Kelce can’t be ruled out. Retirement is on the cards for Travis Kelce and within the next few years, the star athlete will retire; some reports suggest he may retire as early as 2026. Next season marks Kelce’s 13th year in the NFL. He has secured three Super Bowl titles and is undoubtedly destined for the Hall of Fame, though he has not surpassed 1,000 receiving yards in the last two years.Travis Kelce’s contract expires by the end of the season, and even if he retires, he can’t be excluded from the list of players who would be considered for the 2028 Olympic run. The only catch is that Kelce will need to be in good enough form to be considered.He’s 35 now and will likely be 38 in 2028, which makes peak fitness an uphill battle for the athlete. However, his showbiz connections may just come in play here. If Kelce does play in the Olympics, it’s very likely that his famous girlfriend, Taylor Swift will be in attendance to cheer for his team.In fact, if Travis and Taylor decide to tie the knot within the next three years, which is very likely, Taylor’s presence is almost guaranteed, and that will only mean more viewership for the NFL’s exciting new international venture. It remains to be seen how Kelce approaches retirement, if he goes the Tom Hardy way and pursues broadcasting seriously. In this case, he may be tied up with his work and unable to commit to the preparations for the Olympics and, in fact, could be reporting on his home team!","NFL players can take part in the flag football event at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.

Shedeur Sanders could be Browns’ surprising week 1 starter; Head coach Kevin Stefanski hints,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/shedeur-sanders-could-be-browns-surprising-week-1-starter-head-coach-kevin-stefanski-hints/articleshow/121368869.cms,"Shedeur Sanders turning heads in Cleveland’s QB race (Image via: Getty Images)

A closer look at Cleveland’s QB options



In a league obsessed with proven veterans and high draft picks, Shedeur Sanders’ rookie season with the Cleveland Browns promises to be one of the most intriguing quarterback stories of the year. After a surprising slide to the fifth round in the NFL Draft, Sanders finds himself in a rare position not just on the roster, but in genuine contention for the starting job. The Browns’ quarterback competition has suddenly transformed from predictable to wide open, and Sanders stands at the center of it all, ready to disrupt expectations.Cleveland’s quarterback room is unusually crowded with four healthy contenders: Joe Flacco, Kenny Pickett, Dillon Gabriel, and Shedeur Sanders. While Flacco’s experience and Pickett’s status as a recent first-rounder make them obvious frontrunners, the Browns’ head coach Kevin Stefanski dropped a tantalizing hint in a recent ESPN Cleveland interview: everyone on the roster will compete for a role. That statement, while typical coach-speak on the surface, is anything but routine in this situation.Sanders’ path to this moment has been anything but conventional.His college stats tell a compelling story, he completed 74 percent of his passes in his final season at Colorado, showcasing accuracy and poise that could translate well at the pro level. Yet, doubts linger due to his draft-day fall and questions about his ability to adjust quickly to NFL defenses. The Browns, however, are leaving the door wide open, signaling that performance in training camp and preseason could rewrite the script entirely.The initial plan appears to lean toward starting a veteran in Week 1, likely Flacco or Pickett, against the Cincinnati Bengals, a tough divisional rival and reigning playoff powerhouse. But the Browns aren’t closing the door on giving Sanders and Gabriel chances to prove themselves as the season unfolds. This is a rare scenario in the NFL, where rookie quarterbacks, especially late-round picks, rarely get immediate opportunities.Also Read: Kelly Stafford confesses she works on her “booty” just to keep Matthew Stafford interested In a league starved for fresh talent and exciting storylines, Shedeur Sanders might just become the quarterback everyone underestimated. If he seizes this chance, the Browns could have unearthed a gem in the unlikeliest of places and the NFL landscape could be altered in the process. The season is young, and the quarterback race in Cleveland is just heating up. Keep your eyes on Sanders, he’s not just competing for a spot; he’s competing to rewrite his narrative.","Shedeur Sanders is in contention for the starting quarterback job with the Cleveland Browns.

Tyrese Haliburton is turning doubt into dominance

Knicks vs. Pacers Chess Match, OKC Buzzsaw, Outlook for the Nuggets & Celtics | TICKET & THE TRUTH

Tyrese Haliburton was deemed overrated. Now, he’s the clutchest player still in the postseason. He is flipping every story that doubted him, and Paul Pierce is aware of it. As the Indiana Pacers move through one playoff round after another, the former Celtics icon believes no young talent has more to lose or gain than Haliburton. And with each game-winning shot, he’s making Pierce look like a seer.The 2025 NBA Playoffs have really been a stage for Haliburton to shine. After being labeled as the ""most overrated"" in a poll by The Athletic, the 25-year-old point guard for the Indiana Pacers didn't just talk the talk—he walked the walk with some incredible performances. He finished off Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks with a clutch layup in Game 5. Then, against the top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers, he nailed a game-winning three-pointer in Game 2 and followed it up with 31 points to clinch the series in Game 5.In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks, Haliburton dropped 31 points and dished out 11 assists. He nailed a buzzer-beater floater to push the game into overtime, then guided the Pacers to an exciting 138–135 victory. No other young star left—whether it’s MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Minnesota’s up-and-coming star Anthony Edwards , or New York’s cherished Jalen Brunson—has performed quite like Haliburton when it’s been crucial.On KG Certified, Paul Pierce said it best: “He got voted most overrated, which is ridiculous… If he win it? He got the most to gain.” Pierce emphasized that players like Edwards, Gilgeous-Alexander, and Brunson are already household names. Haliburton, on the other hand, still flies under the radar. No signature shoes. No major national marketing deals. Just basketball brilliance in a small market.If Haliburton leads a championship run, he’ll jump into a whole new level of superstardom. As he drives Indiana toward what might be just their second-ever NBA Finals appearance, his underdog tale is turning into the most captivating story in basketball.Also Read: “Clutch time is different” — Stephen A.

The Dodgers two-way sword, Shohei Ohtani has been quite useful for the Los Angeles Dodgers with his bat. However, his pitching skills were not put to use as he was still in rehab to recover from a Tommy John injury. However, Ohtani is all set to face the pitchers for the first time since 2023, even though it’s just a practice session.As per Dodgers manager, Dave Roberts, Shohei Ohtani is ready to pitch in a practice session, where he will be pitching to MLB hitters.Shohei Ohtani is one of the rarest baseball players due to his dually ability of pitching and hitting. In the 2025 season itself, Ohtani has had 197 at-bats, of which he scored 17 homers, and 31 RBIs, which increased his hitting average to .299, OBP to .396, and OPS to 1.041.However, the Dodgers’ star player has not been seen on the mound since 2023, due to an elbow ligament injury.The main reason as to why Shohei Ohtani was not on the mound was because he was in rehab after undergoing a Tommy John surgery in 2023. He had an elbow ligament injury, for which the surgery was important.After the surgery, it has been difficult for Ohtani to appear on the mound. However, after 2 long years, and continuous rehab sessions, Ohtani is finally ready to pitch in a practice session.If everything goes well, Ohtani might appear on the field soon.His pitching abilities speak volumes of his skills. Even though his ERA has been at 3.01 and WHIP at 1.08 since 2023, if Ohtani starts pitching right away, those stats are bound to change. What remains to be seen is how Ohtani pitches in the practice session on Saturday, and whether it goes smoothly, and without any complications.Though Ohtani has won multiple awards for his batsman skills, which include, MCP, Silver Slugger, and NL All-Star, he is yet to win the CY Young award.Also Read: What’s next for Shohei Ohtani after ramping up his pitching progression","Shohei Ohtani is one of the rarest baseball players due to his dually ability of pitching and hitting.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

What the Shoey represents





Shoey, the act of drinking alcohol from a shoe, is one of Australia’s most peculiar and iconic celebratory rituals. Recently, it made headlines again when outgoing Western Australian MP Kyle McGinn concluded his farewell speech in parliament by pulling off his shoe, cracking open a beer, and chugging it from the footwear. Known among his constituents for performing shoeys, McGinn explained the act as a nod to authenticity, proving that ""normal people"" can exist in politics. His farewell shoey wasn’t just a spectacle; it was a statement of identity, mateship and irreverent Aussie spirit.While today it is seen as a humorous and bold act, the shoey has deeper roots. German soldiers in World War I drank from boots for good luck. In early 1900s Chicago, sipping champagne from a woman’s slipper became a decadent trend among elites. The shoey's evolution from military hazing and upper-class indulgence to a beer-fuelled celebration reflects its odd journey through cultural history.The shoey surged in popularity thanks to Australian athletes like MotoGP’s Jack Miller and Formula One star Daniel Ricciardo, who celebrated podium finishes by swigging champagne from their shoes. These moments went viral, making the shoey a recognised symbol of triumph and Aussie pride across the globe.Other celebrities, from actors like Patrick Stewart to singers like Post Malone, joined in and further cemented its appeal.From UFC octagons to music stages and now even legislative chambers, the shoey continues to surprise. MMA fighter Tai Tuivasa has made it a post-fight signature. Harry Styles, Kurtis Conner and Awsten Knight have performed shoeys during concerts. In 2025, Kyle McGinn brought the tradition into Australia’s political arena, marking a new milestone, the shoey as a symbol of public service with a down-to-earth twist.To outsiders it may seem absurd or even unsanitary. But for many Australians, the shoey is a cheeky, heartfelt celebration. It is about authenticity, not elegance; solidarity, not status. When Kyle McGinn raised his shoe in parliament, he wasn’t just drinking, he was delivering a final message, that being genuine sometimes means raising a toast in the most unconventional way possible.The shoey is more than a party trick, it is a cultural expression unique to Australia. Over time it has crossed boundaries of sport, music and even politics. It speaks to a laid-back spirit, a willingness to not take things too seriously. Whether celebrated on a podium or in parliament, the shoey continues to symbolise unity, humour and bold individuality.","Shoey, the act of drinking alcohol from a shoe, is one of Australia’s most peculiar and iconic celebratory rituals.

NEW DELHI: In the absence of Olympic and world champion Neeraj Chopra , promising athlete Sachin Yadav will lead India’s contingent in the javelin throw competition at the Asian athletics championships, commencing in Gumi, South Korea on May 27.The event will mark the 25-year-old’s first international appearance in a senior meet following his notable performances in domestic competitions. Currently India’s second-best javelin thrower after Neeraj, Sachin achieved his personal best of 84.39m at the Uttarakhand National Games this year. His victory at the Federation Cup in Kochi last month, with a throw of 83.86m, secured his spot in the Asian meet.At the Asian event, Sachin aims to qualify for the World athletics championships to be held in Sep in Japan by achieving the qualification standard of 85.50m. His preparations for both the Asian meet and the Worlds got disrupted due to the installation of a new synthetic track at the main Jawaharlal Nehru (JLN) stadium and the warm-up area, ahead of the World Para athletics championships scheduled for Sept-Oct. The ongoing construction work has compelled the javelin thrower to relocate his training base from JLN to an NCoE facility in Faridabad.“It’s difficult to travel to Faridabad every day for training.It consumes a lot of time and affects my training badly. I can understand that new tracks are being laid at JLN for the para Worlds. But some alternative arrangements should have been made by authorities for track and field athletes who find it convenient to train at JLN because of the facilities available and also because it’s conveniently located,” Sachin said.“There are some training facilities in Delhi where athletes visiting JLN aren’t allowed. Chhatrasal stadium is too far from my place, so I can’t go there and prefer going to Faridabad.”Discussing his Asian meet prospects, Sachin said his primary goal is achieving his personal best and securing the Worlds qualification.“I was confident about qualifying for the Worlds from the ‘Neeraj Chopra’ (NC) Classic event in Bengaluru. I had prepared well for it and was looking to make the most of the home advantage. Unfortunately, it got postponed. Nonetheless, I will look to achieve the mark in Gumi. It will be my first international competition and I am confident about my chances,” he said.Hailing from Uttar Pradesh’s Baghpat, Sachin will compete alongside Olympic champion Arshad Nadeem from Pakistan at the Asian event, but he isn’t stressed.“I will be competing with myself. I never get scared by the presence of big names. I try to do my things and look to throw as far as possible. Arshad is a big name. Definitely, it will be tough (competing against him). I can only say, I’ll give my best,” said Sachin.","Sachin Yadav will lead India’s contingent in the javelin throw competition at the Asian athletics championships, commencing in Gumi, South Korea on May 27.
