Goa Club Fire Exposed Deadly Design Errors, Trapping Dozens As Only One Exit Functioned

The hunt begins

Rise of an empire built on speed — and cracks

A tragedy that cracked the façade

GOA: Within three hours of the inferno that tore through Birch by Romeo Lane in Goa’s Arpora — killing 25 people during a packed Saturday-night performance — owners Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra slipped out of the country through Delhi airport.By 5.30am Sunday, the brothers were airborne, headed to Phuket on IndiGo flight 6E-1073, Goa DGP Alok Kumar revealed on Monday, calling their swift exit “a clear attempt to evade investigation”.Even as Saurabh posted a sombre message on social media expressing “profound grief” and “unwavering solidarity” with victims’ families, the Bureau of Immigration issued a LookOut Circular for both brothers. Goa Police, coordinating with Interpol, says it now wants them in custody “at the earliest”.Also read: The 'burning' Luthra empire Goa police on Tuesday issued a blue corner notice through Interpol, aiming to track, identify, and provisionally detain the brothers while extradition proceedings are considered.A Goa police team reached Delhi on Sunday armed with an arrest warrant, searched the Luthras’ residences and offices — but found nothing. Hours later, immigration authorities in Mumbai confirmed the truth: the brothers had bolted.Delhi Police’s crime branch detained senior Romeo Lane executive Bharat Kohli from north Delhi and handed him to Goa Police on transit remand. Another Delhi-based partner, Ajay Gupta, is now on the radar.Meanwhile, four arrested Birch staffers — chief general manager Rajiv Modak, gate manager Priyanshu Thakur, bar manager Rajveer Singhania and general manager Vivek Singh — were remanded to six days' custody. Three suspended Goa government officials have also been summoned.Investigators say electric firecrackers, set off during a belly-dance performance, shot into the club’s wooden ceiling, triggering the blaze that ripped through the first-floor structure packed with 150 guests.To the Luthras, their empire was a decade-long dream that began in Delhi’s Hudson Lane with Mama’s Buoi — a cosy student-favourite.But it was Romeo Lane that turned them into nightlife royalty. What began as a modest Civil Lines spot exploded into a roaring, post-Covid success in Vagator, Goa, drawing tourists with sea views, fire dancers, Bollywood nights and big-budget spectacle.Their brand became so coveted that malls from Indore and Nagpur to Agra and Dehradun queued up to house a Romeo Lane outlet. Developers offered to cover construction. Franchisees paid hefty fees and royalties. Expansion was relentless: 25+ outlets in India, one in Dubai, and nearly 25 more in the works.Behind the scenes, Saurabh was the flamboyant, aggressive face; Gaurav, the quieter engineer-turned-operator. Their paralysed father, Vijay Luthra, remained the family anchor.But rapid growth came with strain. Franchisees complained of being left unattended after signing expensive contracts. Several outlets allegedly suffered losses. Industry insiders say the empire ballooned faster than the brothers could control.Local panchayat authorities have now flagged major violations at Birch — a property the brothers touted as ""India’s first island bar"".The outlet, functional since March 2024, reportedly lacked key safety clearances.Questions rage: Why were these not flagged earlier? Who allowed a kitchen in the basement? Why did enforcement wake up only after 25 people died?In Delhi, murmurs have grown louder. Some franchise partners say they may discard the Romeo Lane brand name entirely. Restaurateurs say the brothers owe the industry — and the families of the dead — an in-person explanation, not a social media statement.From a brand that once epitomised India’s booming nightlife, Romeo Lane now stands at a precipice — its future hostage to an escape in the night, a trail of unanswered questions, and a tragedy that India won’t forget soon.","Romeo Lane owners Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra slipped out of the country through Delhi airport.

NEW DELHI: Smriti Mandhana ’s old motivational words have resurfaced online after she and music composer Palash Muchhal announced that their wedding has been called off. The resurfaced clip, from an interview with Humans of Bombay, shows the India vice-captain speaking about how she deals with difficult phases in life, something fans feel resonates strongly with her current situation.In the interview recorded three years ago, Mandhana opened up about her journey in cricket, navigating expectations and criticism, and building resilience. She revealed that her coping mechanism is rooted in simplicity and routine rather than overthinking setbacks.She explained, “It's pretty easy for me. I have short-term goals. Say if I feel low today, I will just start writing what I have to work on for the next six days or for the next seven days, in my batting or in my fitness. So once I start doing that, I just forget what's happening. I just focus on what I have to do.”Mandhana added that shifting her focus to what lies ahead helps her regain motivation.“So when I change my headspace into what I have to do in the next 6-7 days, I don't know, I just feel like there's so much to look forward to,” she said.Reflecting on her evolution from a young aspiring cricketer to one of the most recognised faces in women’s cricket, Mandhana said the sport has shaped her personality and approach to life.“You have to always start your day as a new day because you start your innings on zero, even if you score a hundred,” she shared.She added, “So that's the biggest takeaway from what I have learnt. Whatever happens in your life the next day is a fresh day.”On Sunday, Mandhana finally addressed the speculation around her personal life, confirming that the wedding with Palash Muchhal had been ""called off."" In her statement, she wrote, ""I need to clarify that the wedding is called off. I would like to close this matter here and implore all of you to do the same.""Calling herself a “very private person,” Mandhana urged fans and the media to ""respect the privacy of both families"" and allow them the space to move on.Looking ahead, Mandhana emphasised her commitment to the sport, saying, ""I believe there is a higher purpose driving us all and for me that has always been representing my country at the highest level. I hope to continue to play and win trophies for India for as long as possible.""She ended her note with gratitude and closure: ""Thank you for all your support. It's time to move forward.""","Smriti Mandhana's old motivational words have resurfaced online. The India vice- captain spoke about how she deals with difficult phases in life.

Just when it seemed seamless scene transitions were a thing of the past, Ciara , Russell Wilson's wife, brought them back in style. She wowed fans with a video that glided from her twerking in laid-back terrace attire to strutting the same moves on bustling city streets in a striking black bodycon maxi dress. Sharing the video clip on Instagram , she set it to her own hit “Low” and enthusiastically captioned it, “Wind dat thang up one time real quick!” Now, where did she wear that gorgeous dress?Ciara recently graced the opening night gala of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater’s 2025 season, honoring Daria L.

The sleeves extended seamlessly into gloves, creating a sleek, uninterrupted line.The sweeping maxi dress, punctuated by the bold slit, lent drama to Ciara’s confident stride and sculpted a flawless silhouette. She chose understated nude makeup, a hint of shadow, bold kohl at the corners of her eyes, and a glossy, bare-toned lipstick for a look that was both sophisticated and striking. Her long, straight black hair, parted down the middle, flowed freely behind her, kept in place by the assertive shoulders of her gown.","Ciara recently graced the opening night gala of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater’s 2025 season.

Quarterback Patrick Mahomes and player Travis Kelce struggled on the field. Brittany Mahomes, wife of Patrick Mahomes, remained silent on social media after the game. This quiet response mirrored the disappointment felt by many fans. The team's playoff hopes are now uncertain.

Kelce struggles, Mahomes takes heat, and Brittany distances herself from the chaos

Brittany Mahomes has never been shy about showing love for the Kansas City Chiefs, especially when her husband Patrick Mahomes takes the field at Arrowhead Stadium. From stadium arrivals to postgame celebrations, her Instagram is often filled with glam snapshots, family moments, and behind-the-scenes excitement. But Sunday’s matchup against the Houston Texans brought a different kind of energy and this time Britney chose not to post at all.After the Chiefs’ 20–10 defeat, the atmosphere among fans turned tense, and the blame quickly fell on both Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce for their lackluster performance. Instead of sharing her usual reactions, Brittany went silent, leaving fans to interpret her disappointment without a word.Before kickoff, Brittany Mahomes seemed poised for another enthusiastic game day, sharing Instagram stories of the stadium buzz. Yet as the game unfolded, Kansas City faltered early and never recovered. Kelce dropped late-game opportunities and the offense struggled to find rhythm, a shock to a fan base accustomed to polished comebacks. Once the loss was sealed, Brittany’s social feed suddenly stopped. No postgame thoughts. No family shots. Just silence.This isn’t the first time her online presence has mirrored the team’s emotional highs and lows.When the Chiefs win, Brittany often floods social media with celebration. But when they lose, fans get nothing at all, a silent statement that speaks louder than her usual hype. Making the night even more unusual, she also wasn’t seen alongside Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez, who attended separately in support of Travis Kelce.With this defeat, Kansas City Chiefs suffers more than a bruised ego. Their playoff hopes are now hanging by a thread, and for the first time in nine seasons, they’ve lost the AFC West crown, a title now held by the Denver Broncos. Their next game against the Chargers could determine whether their season lives or dies.As frustration among supporters rises, Brittany’s silence reflects what many Chiefs fans are feeling: uncertainty. The once-unstoppable dynasty suddenly looks fragile, and if Mahomes and Kelce don’t turn things around fast, the quiet moment on Brittany’s Instagram may be the least of Kansas City’s worries.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes sends a clear message to fans as they question Patrick Mahomes’ legacy during tough season","Brittany Mahomes has never been shy about showing love for the Kansas City Chiefs.

Tee Higgins Week 15 status: Concussion protocol updates and team outlook



‘Uncomfortable’ to watch Bengals’ Tee Higgins after head injury | Pro Football Talk | NFL on NBC

Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins is back in the concussion protocol as the team heads into Week 15. After recently returning from a prior concussion, Higgins’ availability remains uncertain. While he played through Sunday’s high-scoring matchup against the Buffalo Bills, lingering health concerns have prompted the team to proceed cautiously.During the game, Higgins endured multiple hard hits to the head but cleared on-field concussion tests and was able to finish the contest. Post-game, however, he reported symptoms consistent with a concussion, leading to his return to the league’s concussion protocol. Updates on his condition are expected to emerge throughout the week as the team monitors his recovery.Head coach Zac Taylor confirmed that Higgins has re-entered the concussion protocol but did not provide a definitive update on his Week 15 availability. The Bengals will continue evaluating him closely, following strict NFL concussion guidelines that prioritize player health and full recovery. The first detailed update on Higgins’ status is expected Wednesday when Cincinnati releases its initial injury report for the week.Participation in limited practice would indicate progress, but nothing is guaranteed at this stage. The team has emphasized caution after Higgins’ recent concussion history, ensuring no risk is taken with his long-term health. How the Bengals adjust their offensive game plan may also depend on Higgins’ participation later in the week.This marks Higgins’ second concussion in recent weeks, which increases the likelihood that he could miss the upcoming matchup. His uncertain status could significantly impact the Bengals’ passing game, as other receivers may need to take on a larger role if Higgins is unable to play. Analysts and teams will be monitoring developments closely throughout the week to understand how Cincinnati may adjust its offensive strategy in his absence.For now, the Bengals are managing Higgins’ recovery carefully, ensuring he is fully cleared before returning to the field. Weekly updates will provide clarity on whether he can participate in practice or suit up for Sunday’s game, offering a clearer picture of the team’s offensive outlook without one of its key wide receivers.Also Read: Marvin Harrison Jr. injury update: Heel issue leaves Cardinals wide receiver’s week 15 return in doubt","Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins is back in the concussion protocol.

Shohei Ohtani vs Juan Soto: Who really has the highest net worth in 2025?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/shohei-ohtani-vs-juan-soto-who-really-has-the-highest-net-worth-in-2025/articleshow/125861466.cms,"Shohei Ohtani and Juan Soto (Image via: IG/X)

Shohei Ohtani is currently richer because of his growing net worth and massive endorsement income



Juan Soto becomes the highest yearly earner because he bet on himself and won the biggest contract

Shohei Ohtani and Juan Soto now headline baseball’s richest rivalry as their careers reshape how modern athletes earn and protect wealth. Ohtani is a Japanese megastar with an estimated net worth of 150 million dollars while Soto is a Dominican standout worth about 100 million dollars. Their new contracts changed the market yet their money flows differently which makes their comparison fascinating. One earns later through planning and global deals while the other takes home record money today.Ohtani rose in Japan as a two way star before joining MLB while Soto became a World Series hero at a young age. Both became must watch players but their financial paths were shaped by different choices. Ohtani signed a 10 year 700 million dollar deal with the Dodgers but gets only 2 million dollars over that span before the real money arrives from 2034. Soto signed a 15 year 765 million dollar deal with the Mets that pays him 51 million dollars yearly with no delays.Ohtani reached MLB with star status already built which helped him earn brands fast even when his salary was low. Between 2018 and 2022 he earned under 10 million dollars from baseball which is small compared to his value. His one year 30 million dollar deal in 2023 pushed him toward free agency and his record Dodgers deal followed soon after.His deferred plan gives security for later years while endorsements between 40 and 50 million dollars yearly build his wealth now.Ohtani is rare because he makes more away from baseball than on the field due to his worldwide following. His success in Japan and America made him a marketing face that few athletes ever reach. That combination lets him collect steady money today and huge checks in the future. His journey shows how fame plus patience can deliver long term financial power.Soto built his profile with confidence and production which earned the nickname “Childish Bambino”. He rejected a 13 year 350 million dollar offer and later turned down a 15 year 440 million dollar extension which shocked many. Those decisions led him to the largest baseball deal ever at 765 million dollars. From 2015 to 2024 he already earned 82 million dollars which added to his foundation.His contract with the Mets pays him now instead of later which makes him the richest player yearly in baseball today. His rise shows how the right gamble at the right time can change a career path. Soto proved that young stars can shape their own value instead of accepting early deals. His path gives the next generation a guide on how to chase true market worth.Ohtani and Soto are elite players who became the faces of baseball’s money era through different tactics. One built a brand empire while the other maximized guaranteed salary. Both approaches worked and changed how the sport sees contracts and long term planning. Their rivalry will play out not only on the diamond but also in the financial story fans follow next.Also read: Inside the fairytale life George Springer shares with his wife Charlise Castro who built her own path before the spotlight",Shohei Ohtani is a Japanese megastar with an estimated net worth of 150 million dollars.

The Twitch community is once again buzzing after popular streamer RaKai reacted strongly to a joke made about him by Blaire “QTCinderella” during The Streamer Awards 2025. The moment, which was meant to be lighthearted, quickly turned into a major online controversy after RaKai addressed it during a livestream.QTCinderella had teased several creators during a live segment at the awards.

Take his mic. Yeah, no, he’s learned his lesson. He’s not allowed to answer that.”RaKai spoke about the moment during his livestream. The 16-year-old streamer shared how angry he felt at the time.While venting, he used harsh language and said, “You want to know what I was going to say? I was going to say, ‘Listen, bch, what’s the coolest dk you’ve ever sucked?

Former NFL quarterback Philip Rivers built a remarkable legacy over his 17-year career with the Los Angeles Chargers and Indianapolis Colts. Known for his competitive spirit, durability, and impressive numbers - including 63,440 passing yards and 421 touchdowns, Rivers earned a place among the NFL’s most respected quarterbacks. But beyond football, Rivers often emphasised that his greatest pride is not found on the field, but at home.Philip Rivers married his middle school sweetheart, Tiffany, in 2001. The two met while growing up in Alabama and built their relationship long before Rivers became a household NFL name. Tiffany converted to Catholicism before marriage, and faith has remained central to their family life.The couple now has one of the largest families associated with an NFL star, 10 children in total. Their growing family has drawn curiosity from fans, but both Philip and Tiffany describe it as a blessing rather than a challenge.Tiffany, known for keeping a low public profile, co-founded Hermoza, a modest swimwear line. She also played a key role in the Rivers of Hope Foundation, which previously helped foster and orphaned children find permanent homes.Despite the chaos that comes with a family of 12, Rivers says their marriage works because they remain “best friends,” navigating life’s busy moments together.Faith played a major role in the Rivers family. Both Philip and Tiffany have spoken openly about raising their children with the same Catholic values they prioritise. Their home is described as energetic, structured and deeply rooted in family-first principles.After retiring from the NFL in 2021, Rivers shifted to coaching at St. Michael Catholic High School in Fairhope, Alabama. The move allowed him to spend more time with Tiffany and their children, and even coach their son, Gunner, who plays quarterback for the school.Philip Rivers attributes much of his work ethic to his parents, Steve and Joan Rivers. His father was a high school football coach, while his mother taught at the same school. Growing up in a football environment shaped Rivers from a young age, and his No. 17 jersey was worn as a tribute to his father, who wore the same number.Rivers has often said that while he inherited his athleticism from his father, his competitiveness came from his mother. Both supported his football journey from youth leagues to the NFL.","Former NFL quarterback Philip Rivers married his middle school sweetheart, Tiffany, in 2001.

‘Day-to-day’ or done for 2025? Where Drake London stands before Week 15 vs. Buccaneers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/day-to-day-or-done-for-2025-where-drake-london-stands-before-week-15-vs-buccaneers/articleshow/125872665.cms,"Drake London remains day-to-day with a PCL sprain as the Falcons enter Week 15 on a short week.

Drake London’s Week 15 status looks nothing like a player who is close to returning

What Drake London’s injury means for the Falcons’ offense and fantasy playoffs

Drake London has not played a snap since he crumpled to the turf in overtime of the Atlanta Falcons’ Week 11 loss to the Carolina Panthers with a knee injury. The team keeps calling him “day-to-day,” but the calendar, the injury report, and the standings are all saying something very different.With a short week before “Thursday Night Football” against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, every update on London has pointed in one direction. Another DNP, and a real chance that the franchise wideout is effectively done for 2025.The timeline on London’s knee has been messy from the start. He hurt it in overtime in Week 11 against Carolina after posting seven catches for 119 yards. He left that game and has not played since.Early on, the outlook was optimistic. ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that the injury was not believed to be serious and that London might not miss time. NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport echoed that early read, noting that the Falcons’ WR had avoided major structural damage. Both reports came before the full picture was clear.Rapoport later reported that London had a sprained PCL and would miss at least Week 12. That diagnosis changed everything.PCL sprains usually come with recovery windows in the four-to-six-week range, and they tend to get worse when players try to rush back.Since that update, the pattern has been the same. London has missed three straight games. He has yet to log a single practice rep. He keeps landing on Atlanta’s injury reports as a non-participant.Jack McKessy of USA TODAY noted that London was listed as a DNP on the Falcons’ first Week 15 report, which was estimated because the team did not hold a full practice on Monday, Dec. 8. That was the fourth time in a row he appeared on the report with that same status since the injury.Head coach Raheem Morris has tried to keep the language positive. Ahead of Week 14, he told reporters that London had been upgraded to day-to-day and that he was feeling better and moving around more. On Monday of Week 15, Morris stuck to the same line, telling reporters, “Drake is still day-to-day.”The problem is that the tape on the week does not match the quote. London still has no real practice work. The team is on a short week. And Atlanta is already out of the playoff race.Tori McElhaney of AtlantaFalcons.com laid it out bluntly. In her Monday injury report breakdown, she wrote that she does not expect London to suit up this week, adding, “If London can get some practice reps, maybe he will be a true game-time decision. However, I think it is more likely the Falcons continue to shut him down this week and hope to get him back to 100% after the mini-bye.”Mike Moraitis also pointed out that the Falcons did not put London on injured reserve, which means they originally expected him to miss fewer than four games. That bet has already lost. He has missed three straight, is tracking toward a fourth, and nothing about his current workload suggests he is close.When you add in the context PFSN’s earlier fantasy breakdown highlighted, a PCL sprain, no practice at all, and a team with “dead playoff hopes”, the reality is simple. The “day-to-day” label is technical. The actual status is “unlikely to play,” and the conversation is quietly shifting from Week 15 to whether it makes any sense to risk him again before 2026.The reason this story will not go away is because London is not just any wideout on this depth chart. He is the passing game.Even after missing three games, London still leads the Falcons in almost every receiving category: targets, receiving yards, touchdowns, 20-plus-yard receptions, and first downs. Before the injury, he went over 100 yards in three straight outings and has 810 receiving yards and six touchdowns in nine games. That is 13.5 yards per catch and exactly 90 yards per game, which puts him on pace for back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons if he were healthy enough to finish.Without him, the receivers room looks thin. Darnell Mooney has slid into the WR1 role by default, but none of the reporting suggests the Falcons suddenly see him as a true replacement for London. Kyle Pitts and David Sills have seen more work as well, yet the offense has clearly lost its top mismatch on the outside.PFSN’s fantasy analysis has already treated this like a long-term problem, not a one-week blip. That breakdown pointed out that London stacked 651 yards and six touchdowns in his last six full games, cementing himself as a WR1 for fantasy managers. Losing that level of consistency in November and December is brutal in any format.The same piece also made the hard call most fantasy managers do not want to hear. With a PCL sprain, zero practice participation since the injury, and Atlanta’s season “an absolute wash,” there is no logical incentive for the team to put London back on the field for what are essentially meaningless December games. The conclusion there was direct: if you need the roster spot for the fantasy playoffs, you can drop him.That stance lines up with the beat reporting coming out of Atlanta. McElhaney does not believe he plays in Week 15. Morris keeps saying day-to-day, but that has yet to translate into actual work on the field. The team itself has every reason to protect its franchise receiver, get him fully right for 2026, and avoid turning a PCL sprain into something worse.Barring a surprise spike in practice participation on Tuesday or Wednesday, London is trending toward another inactive. The Falcons will file two more injury reports before kickoff, but at this point, any practice designation short of “limited” or “full” would only confirm what the last month has already told us.For Atlanta, that means another game without the player who best stretches the field and bails out the quarterback in tight windows. For fantasy managers, it probably means facing the most important weeks of the season without the player they drafted to carry their WR room.Week 15 may give us the final word on London’s status for the rest of the year. Right now, all the evidence says the same thing. The tag might be “day-to-day,” but the situation is much closer to “see you in 2026.”","Drake London has not played a snap since he crumpled to the turf in overtime of the Atlanta Falcons’ Week 11 loss to the Carolina Panthers.

Rudy Gobert was ejected for a flagrant 2 foul



With Rudy Gobert off the court, Minnesota fought tooth and nail



A game that was supposed to extend Minnesota Timberwolves’ winning streak to 6, instead it served the Wolves with chaos and frustration involving their defensive anchor, Rudy Gobert. His third-quarter ejection became the defining moment of Minnesota’s 105–108 loss to the Phoenix Suns, who were missing Devin Booker, on Monday at the Target Center. This loss, having the home advantage, raised fresh questions about discipline, decision-making, and depth.The turning point arrived in the third quarter with 8:00 left on the game clock, when Phoenix big man Mark Williams attacked the rim while being defended by Rudy Gobert and Julius Randle. Rudy Gobert, late to the play, met him at the basket with a foul that went far beyond a routine contest. He elbowed Williams mid-air, sending the Suns center crashing to the floor, stopping the game as officials and players rushed towards the scene.Rudy Gobert’s decision to foul in that moment, while Mark Williams was already in the air and driving, just wasn’t a smart call. It was a dangerous situation that could’ve ended badly, and the officials clearly saw it the same way.They reviewed the play and swiftly determined that it satisfied the criteria for a flagrant 2. Gobert was ejected, overwriting what had been one of his strongest starts in recent weeks: 15 points, eight rebounds, and the kind of interior presence Minnesota leans on heavily.Tyler Ford, the match official, while announcing the decision said, ""There is wind-up and significant impact to the ribs of Williams, who is airborne and a vulnerable player with a high potential for injury. That contact is both unnecessary and excessive.""For the Suns, Williams bounced back with poise, shaking off the fall and turning in one of the most impressive performances of his young career, including his first-ever made three-pointer on the way to 22 points.But for all the individual brilliance, the Wolves couldn’t overcome the absence of their defensive anchor. Anthony Edwards , when asked how the Wolves can make up for Rudy Gobert’s absence, said, “You can’t make up for Rudy’s absence, when he’s in the game it’s like they don’t want to go down there and finish. So of course he’s truly missed when he’s not on the court.”Even with Gobert gone, Minnesota fought hard to keep its streak alive. Anthony Edwards delivered an electrifying 40-point outing, cruising through defenders with confidence and keeping the Wolves within reach until the final minutes. Julius Randle added 21 points and eight assists, showcasing a strong all-around performance.The Minnesota Timberwolves (15-9) need to buckle up as they are traveling to San Francisco next to meet the Golden State Warriors (13-12) before heading home for a five-game stand that stretches toward late December. With the Western Conference tightening, Minnesota will need to regroup quickly and ensure discipline doesn’t become its undoing again.Also Read: “I've wanted to punch them”: Stephen Curry’s wife Ayesha Curry opens up about the anger she feels when wo","Rudy Gobert was ejected for a flagrant 2 foul on Phoenix Suns center Mark Williams.

Why did Khamzat Chimaev criticize Alex Pereira after UFC title win

Khamzat Chimaev has once again spoken openly about a possible fight with Alex Pereira. The undefeated UFC contender believes the fight is not happening because neither Pereira nor the UFC truly want it. Chimaev shared his views during a recent interview with ESPN MMA, where he questioned Pereira’s intentions and the promotion’s decision-making.Alex Pereira, the current UFC light heavyweight champion, reclaimed his title in October at UFC 320 with a first-round knockout win over Magomed Ankalaev. Soon after that win, Khamzat Chimaev called him out for a high-profile fight. While fans showed interest, the matchup has not moved forward.After UFC 320, held in October 2024, Khamzat Chimaev publicly challenged Alex Pereira. Pereira knocked Magomed Ankalaev out in the opening round to reclaim the UFC light heavyweight title.Chimaev went on social media and challenged Pereira to a match after the fight, even advocating a heavyweight fight.Later, Alex Pereira set requirements for the match, which Chimaev claimed he agreed to. Still, no deal followed.Speaking to ESPN MMA in a recent interview released this week, Chimaev claimed the UFC does not want to make the fight happen.“Good fight for me. Everyone knows that,” Khamzat Chimaev said. “UFC knows that, but UFC doesn’t want to give this guy to me.”He also pushed back on Pereira’s comments about fame and popularity. Chimaev said his social media reach proves fans want to see him fight, not talk.Chimaev added that he feels Pereira is avoiding him. “I don’t think he wants that fight,” Chimaev said. “He knows about it, and UFC knows about it.”Chimaev has previously mentioned wanting to fight Alex Pereira. Chimaev expressed his candid perspective on the battle during an interview last year with ex-UFC middleweight champion Michael Bisping.In 2024, Chimaev was interviewed while still competing at the highest level across disciplines. Because of styles, Chimaev stated the battle would be simpler for him than others.However, he did not dismiss Pereira’s power.“I know the guy can knock me out,” Chimaev said. “He is one of the best strikers and hardest punchers.” Chimaev explained that his advantage would come from wrestling and grappling.He believes his ground skills set him apart. At the same time, he admitted respect for Pereira’s striking ability, calling it elite.For now, the fight remains uncertain.

Twitch Streamer Tekashi 6ix9ine sparks buzz with prison fitness plan amid supervision

“Gooba”





Tekashi 6ix9ine’s legal journey is heading into its next chapter, and this time, the controversial rapper and occasional Twitch streamer is planning for more than just time behind bars. The 29-year-old artist, known for his bold persona and rainbow-colored hair, will begin a 3-month prison sentence on January 6 next year. But he insists he’s not stressed about serving time. In fact, he claims he’s ready to use the isolation to focus on a major fitness transformation. His goal? Drop from 190 pounds to 120 while behind bars, using a highly unusual diet that’s already stirring social media chatter, one box of Oreo cookies a day.Alongside his jail stint, 6ix9ine is also facing 12 months of supervised release once he’s out. According to newly obtained court documents, the judge has mandated a strict mental health treatment program centered around anger management. Additionally, an outpatient drug treatment program will be part of his release conditions, a decision linked to authorities allegedly recovering drugs during a raid on his property earlier this year.His long-running legal struggles date back to his high-profile racketeering case involving the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods, where his cooperation with federal prosecutors earned him thelabel, and likely special housing arrangements when his sentence begins.Therapper told TMZ that due to his informant status, he expects to avoid the general prison population for his safety. But rather than viewing his potential seclusion as punishment, he says it will give him room to refocus and work on himself physically and mentally. Fans, skeptics, and fitness experts are already sounding off online, with many highly doubtful about the health risks of his extreme prison diet plan. Still, 6ix9ine appears motivated to turn the situation into a reset phase, especially after spending years under probation and navigating frequent controversy.As he prepares for the start of his sentence, the industry will be watching closely. Between mandated anger management, drug monitoring, and his bold weight-loss claims, Tekashi 6ix9ine continues to captivate headlines, whether for music or mayhem. If his transformation is successful, his release next year could mark yet another reinvention in a career defined by chaos and comebacks.Also Read: Everything you need to know about Dimz_live and the Twitch dog-abuse scandal",Tekashi 6ix9ine will begin a 3-month prison sentence on January 6 next year.

Edwin Díaz gives Los Angeles Dodgers needed ninth inning stability

Edwin Díaz is officially moving to Los Angeles. On Tuesday, during the MLB Winter Meetings in Orlando, Florida, the Los Angeles Dodgers reached a three year, $69 million agreement with former New York Mets closer Edwin Díaz. Sources confirmed the deal to ESPN reporters Jeff Passan and Jorge Castillo. The signing gives the Dodgers the top relief pitcher available in free agency.The move comes after a rough season for the Dodgers bullpen. Late leads disappeared too often, forcing the team to use starting pitchers in relief during key moments. By adding Edwin Díaz, the Dodgers now have a clear and trusted option to close games heading into the 2025 season.Edwin Díaz, now 31, enters Los Angeles as a three time All Star and one of baseball’s hardest throwers. Based on mean yearly value, the agreement establishes a new standard for a relief pitcher.He last pitched for the New York Mets during the 2024 season. With the Mets, Díaz had a 1.63 ERA and converted 28 of 31 save attempts.With just 14 walks, he struck 98 batters over 66 and one third innings. Despite past injuries, his fastball and crisp slider stayed excellent.Last year, the Dodgers had difficulty in late innings.Their bullpen finished with a 4.27 ERA and blew 27 saves, one of the highest totals in Major League Baseball.Due to the lack of relief depth, Los Angeles shifted pitchers like Roki Sasaki, Emmet Sheehan, Justin Wrobleski, and at times Tyler Glasnow into bullpen roles.Dodgers manager Dave Roberts spoke Monday in Orlando before the deal was announced. “Getting a high leverage reliever is never a bad thing,” Roberts told reporters.With Díaz closing, Tanner Scott is expected to handle setup duties, while Alex Vesia, Blake Treinen, Anthony Banda, and Brusdar Graterol round out the group.Edwin Díaz opted out of the remaining two years and $38 million on the five year deal he signed with the Mets in 2022. He declined the $22.025 million qualifying offer on November 18 to test the open market.Since Díaz signed with another team, the Mets will receive a compensatory draft pick after the fourth round. On December 1, New York signed Devin Williams to a three year, $51 million deal as bullpen insurance.Díaz experienced both highs and lows while playing for the Mets. Three times he published an ERA below 2.00, but in other years he fought. Suffering a knee injury while celebrating a save during the World, he also missed the whole 2023 season. Classic Baseball.ESPN Research claims that since his debut in 2016, Edwin Díaz has 253 career saves, tying Raisel Iglesias for second most in that span behind Kenley Jansen.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: Alex Bregman Race Puts Bo Bichette In Play As Blue Jays Eye Tatsuya Imai","The Los Angeles Dodgers have signed Edwin Díaz to a three year, $69 million deal.

The alleged perpetrator, reportedly from New York, made the remarks after Fanfan allegedly made jokes about Kai Cenat. The incident has sparked calls for improved security at influencer events.

Alleged bathroom threats described as violent and sexually abusive by livestream clip





The Streamer Awards 2025 was meant to be a celebration of the year’s biggest creators, from record-breaking Twitch personalities to viral gaming icons. But alongside the jokes, red carpet photos and fan excitement, a troubling story has emerged about an alleged threat made against streamer Fiona “Fanfan. ”Instead of post-event buzz being centered around winners and standout moments, one clip circulating on X has ignited concern about safety at influencer events. In it, financial creator Jason “TheStockGuy” recounts overhearing a violent conversation at the venue, one that included both physical and sexual assault threats directed at Fanfan, allegedly sparked by jokes she made about Kai Cenat.In a three-minute clip from his Just Chatting livestream, TheStockGuy claims the incident happened during intermission. He said he had gone to the restroom when he overheard an unidentified man raging: “Yo! F**k that bch! Man, f**k that bch! I’ll fking toss that bch! I’ll f**king knock her f**king teeth out! How she gonna s*ck d**k with no teeth?!”The language shocked him, but what followed was even more disturbing. The creator recalls the same man escalating the threats, turning them into explicit sexual assault remarks. “And then he started saying some s**t about… I don’t want to repeat it, about some things that are assault-wise that he's going to do her.”TheStockGuy continued by emphasizing just how serious the threats sounded: “This dude's in the bathroom talking about he's going to straight up f**king beat the s**t out of her.Do some horrible things to her.” He described confronting the man as he exited, asking, “Yo, man, are you okay? Like, you good?” The alleged threatener didn’t respond, and his companion dismissed it with, “‘Oh, man, he's just from New York,’” before they left.As of now, Fanfan has not publicly addressed the alleged incident, nor has the event organizer, QTCinderella. Online reactions are rapidly calling for investigation and stronger security at events where public figures are exposed to fans and critics alike. What was supposed to be a night honoring streamers has instead raised urgent questions about creator safety, harassment, and the growing hostility in influencer spaces.Also Read: ""A loser"": Zack Peter tears into Meghan Markle’s Netflix holiday special with blunt criticism","A financial creator overheard violent and sexually abusive threats directed at streamer Fiona ""Fanfan"" in a venue restroom.

Tyler Robinson’s parents helped turn him in after FBI photos, says Brian Entin





Megyn Kelly reacted strongly after new details came out about Tyler Robinson and his parents. Writing on X, Kelly shared the update and how Robinson was turned in. She wrote, “ICYMI: this is how Tyler Robinson was turned in. Also his parents are now conducting virtual visits.”According to The Post Millennial, this reaction came after NewsNation reporter Brian Entin shared new information in the case tied to the killing of Charlie Kirk . The report says Tyler Robinson’s parents are now having virtual visits with their son while he is in jail. These visits are not face to face. They happen on tablets inside the jail.The case has drawn wide attention because of how Robinson was identified and turned in by his own parents. Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, was shot and killed on September 10 while hosting a campus event at Utah Valley University. Two days later, on September 12, police took 22-year-old Tyler Robinson into custody. Investigators say his parents played a major role in alerting police.According to The Post Millennial, NewsNation Senior National Correspondent Brian Entin confirmed that Tyler Robinson’s parents are now in touch with their son through virtual jail visits.Entin said, “Now, I’ve confirmed through sources that his family has been having virtual visits with him in jail, with Tyler Robinson in jail.” He added that in-person visits at the Utah jail “don’t really happen very much” and when they do, “they happen behind glass. ”Entin also explained how Robinson was identified. Court documents show Robinson confessed to his father after FBI photos of the suspect were released. Entin said Robinson’s father told police that when his wife showed him the surveillance image on the news, “he agreed it looked like their son.” The father also believed the rifle police were looking for matched one he had given his son as a gift.The father then asked Tyler Robinson to send a picture of the rifle, but Robinson did not reply.

Blogger Zack Peter led the backlash, questioning the show's value and Markle's talent. While some viewers find the content warm and cozy, critics argue the lifestyle inspiration falls flat, despite the show generating significant discussion.

Meghan Markle’s latest Netflix project, With Love, Meghan: Holiday Celebration, arrived with cozy intentions; festive recipes, warm conversation, and a dose of lifestyle inspiration from the Duchess of Sussex. But instead of being greeted with holiday cheer, the special has become a new target for online commentators who question whether the series has any meaningful value.While Markle’s cooking-and-chat format aims to show a more relatable side of her life, critics argue the execution feels confused and uninspired. One of the loudest voices in the backlash is blogger and podcaster Zack Peter, who didn’t hold back during an appearance on Don’t Let It Stu, hosted by Chef Stuart O’Keeffe.Peter slammed the show for lacking purpose, delivering one of the harshest critiques yet. “Like I just, I don't understand the value of this show. I don't get it. Who is watching it? Why are you watching it?” he said before moving into a fiery assessment of Markle herself.“It's not like you're watching it because she's pretty. It's not like you're watching it because she's talented. It's not like you're watching it because you're really learning anything.It's like, why are we watching this show? What are you selling me? A jam?” He went on to call Markle “a f**king loser,” a comment that has since circulated heavily online.Peter and O’Keeffe then mocked moments from the episode, especially Meghan reacting to her own ingredients as though she was reading them for the first time. O’Keeffe joked, “And then she’s like, and so there’s 2 cups of powdered sugar. Wow. That's a lot of sugar.” Peter responded with equal sarcasm: “You don't even know what we're f**king making. Why am I here?”Not all reactions have been hostile. Italian chef Francesco Mazzei recently weighed in on Talking Royals, suggesting Meghan’s recipes might still produce great food, even if her technique is questionable. He admitted, “I don't think so,” when asked if he enjoyed her show, but added, “maybe she did an amazing dish.”Despite the backlash, some viewers say the special feels “warm and cosy,” proving that Meghan’s lifestyle approach may appeal more as comfort content than culinary instruction. Whether critics like it or not, Markle’s holiday show has clearly achieved one goal, everyone is talking about it.Also Read: ""A MAGA"": Perez Hilton calls out Sydney Sweeney’s 'new stance' as she finally addresses American Eagle ad outrage","Critics question purpose, execution, and Meghan Markle’s presence on her own show.

Owens argues the organization rushed leadership during profound grief, potentially placing Erika in an overwhelming role. She suggests an interim CEO would have been a more appropriate transition, allowing time for healing and reassessment.

Candace Owens Explodes; Claims Tpusa Staffer Hid Charlie Kirk’s ‘Death Text’

Candace Owens argues TPUSA blurred grief with leadership and mishandled a sensitive transition





Turning Point USA has been in the spotlight ever since the tragic assassination of Charlie Kirk in September 2025, but the controversy isn’t limited to the late conservative figure’s death. His widow, Erika Kirk, stepped into his CEO role just days after the tragedy, a decision that political commentator Candace Owens believes was rushed and mishandled.During a recent discussion with Russell Brand, Owens questioned whether the organization made the right leadership choice amid profound grief and chaos. Russell Brand uploaded the exchange on December 9, quoting Owens’ blunt reaction: “I think they made a managerial error.” What followed was Owens’ sharp critique of Erika’s abrupt appointment and how it may have set TPUSA up for deeper turmoil.According to Owens, the decision to elevate Erika so quickly placed someone who was still processing trauma into a spotlight she didn’t freely choose. Owens suggested that Erika might be facing either “the greatest evil that ever happened” or simply “terrified” to suddenly be leading an established conservative powerhouse.She warned that the organization’s rush created a situation where Erika was expected to defend TPUSA while still mourning. “She should never become the CEO and chairman overnight,” Owens said, adding that rapid promotion meant “now when people have questions, you got to answer them, right?”Owens argued that the organization should have installed an interim CEO. She insisted that “any company would do” this, allowing time to grieve and reassess rather than trying to mimic Charlie’s leadership style immediately. “You’re not just a grieving widow, but you very quickly decided that you were equipped to be Charlie,” she continued, calling Erika’s new role a “trial by fire.”The tension between Owens and TPUSA has only amplified due to a recent livestream dispute, in which Owens accused the organization of misleading her about timing and location. She further questioned why Erika was reportedly directing decisions behind the scenes, posting, “Did she approve of the letter Blake read?”Still, Owens maintained she is open to a transparent discussion, saying, “We can still make this work… and I would especially like to make this work if you are saying or implying that Erica Kirk is going to be there.”The debate now raises deeper questions: Was TPUSA honoring Charlie’s legacy, or rushing to contain its future? Candace Owens clearly believes the answer matters, now more than ever.Also Read: Candace Owens alleges Charlie Kirk predicted his own murder in message sent a day before his death","Candace Owens criticizes Turning Point USA's swift appointment of Erika Kirk as CEO after Charlie Kirk's assassination.

Shedeur Sanders ends the “thonggate” talk



The Cleveland Browns found themselves at the center of one of the strangest viral moments of the week, and it had nothing to do with playbooks or game plans. Instead, rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders became the focus of an unexpected debate that spread across social media faster than any highlight. Viewers paused their screens, zoomed in and argued over one simple question: was he wearing a thong under his uniform? The clip dominated timelines, leaving fans confused and amused in equal measure.While the noise grew louder online, Shedeur was shaking off none of it. He had just delivered his strongest performance so far, throwing for 364 yards and three touchdowns in a tough loss to the Titans. His play was so sharp that head coach Kevin Stefanski immediately named him the Browns’ starter for the final four games. Yet even on a night filled with promise, the internet turned its attention to a mystery that only one person could clear up.The answer came straight from a family conversation when his brother, Shilo Sanders, decided to address the topic head-on. Shilo didn’t waste time and asked, “Let's cut to the business, bruh. Did you wear a thong or not?”Shedeur couldn’t help but laugh. He explained, “Come on, bruh… You forgot I had a little back injury, right? So I get my back taped.But that is crazy that it did look like that. That's funny, though.” For anyone still unsure, he added one final line: “Yes, bro. There's not no thong, bruh. That’s just weird.”With that, the mystery turned out to be nothing more than medical tape. The rookie later posted “Yall trippin” on Instagram, a short message that captured his disbelief at how quickly the story blew up.Still, the moment offered a glimpse into how fast a sideline clip can become a cultural topic. Fans joked about rookie hazing, theories piled up and memes flooded feeds. Through it all, Shedeur stayed focused on football, not fashion.Now that “thonggate” is settled, Sanders and his taped-up back head into their next challenge against the Chicago Bears, hoping the conversation shifts back to the one thing he controls: his performance on the field.Also Read: Drake Maye’s wife Ann trades “Bakemas” videos for unforgettable glam moment at Patriots’ big holiday gathering","Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders was the focus of an unexpected debate.

Bill Belichick family drama erupts as daughter-in-law takes public jab at his 24-year-old girlfriend Jordon Hudson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/belichick-family-drama-erupts-as-daughter-in-law-takes-public-jab-at-his-24-year-old-girlfriend-jordon-hudson/articleshow/125879682.cms,"Bill Belichick's relationship with his 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, is facing family opposition. His daughter-in-law, Jennifer Belichick, publicly supported Bill's ex-girlfriend, Linda Holliday, after reportedly issuing an ultimatum to choose between family and Hudson. This public display intensifies the drama surrounding the coach's personal life.

Daughter-in-law’s message and public appearance with Bill Belichick’s ex sparks deeper conflict

Bill Belichick has spent decades navigating tough decisions on the football field, but the latest storyline surrounding him isn’t about X’s and O’s, it’s about his personal life. His relationship with 24-year-old girlfriend Jordon Hudson has been under intense public scrutiny from the start, and now the tension appears to be coming from his own inner circle.Belichick, who recently began a new era at North Carolina after leaving the Patriots, moved to Chapel Hill with Hudson, a former college cheerleader. Their romance, which began after meeting on a flight, has been a constant topic online. However, a recent move from Belichick’s daughter-in-law has ignited a new round of drama, suggesting the family isn’t exactly embracing Hudson with open arms.According to reports, Steve Belichick’s wife, Jennifer, previously issued an ultimatum to Bill, forcing him to “choose between his family and his girlfriend.” The New York Post revealed that Jen not only accused Hudson of being controlling, but also criticized her “body and fashion choices.”If that friction wasn’t clear enough, Jen recently made her stance public. Over the weekend, she posted an Instagram Story proudly hanging out with Belichick’s ex-girlfriend, Linda Holliday, at the Nantucket Christmas Stroll.“Jennifer, the wife of Bill’s son Steve Belichick, posted a photo with Holliday via her Instagram Story over the weekend from the iconic Nantucket Christmas Stroll,” an Us Weekly report stated. She even added a festive caption, calling Holliday “The Stroll queen,” and highlighted Linda in a Mrs. Claus-style outfit. The post wasn’t subtle, it seemed like a direct jab at Hudson, especially given the timing and the family tension.Belichick and Holliday dated for roughly 16 years before separating in 2023. Hudson and Belichick were seen together soon after, which fueled speculation that the relationship moved forward quickly. Now, with the family visibly siding with Holliday, the situation has shifted from private tension to public messaging.Whether Belichick addresses it or not, the off-field spotlight isn’t dimming anytime soon. And as Hudson remains a polarizing figure, the real question may be whether the legendary coach can keep peace off the sidelines as easily as he once controlled a locker room on game day.Also Read: “Mentally off”: Fans erupt after Jordon Hudson files FOIA request on behalf of Bill Belichick amid Pablo Torre controversy","Belichick's relationship with 24-year-old Jordon Hudson has been under intense public scrutiny.

Despite personal grief, he remains a staunch supporter of his son Travis, defending him against criticism amid the Chiefs' challenging season.

Papa Kelce ’s new hobby arrives as he remains a fierce defender of Travis Kelce

Grief doesn’t end when life keeps moving. Instead, people often learn to carry their loss while finding new reasons to look forward. That is exactly the path Ed Kelce, father of Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce , appears to be embracing months after losing his longtime girlfriend, Maureen Maguire, who passed away at 74.Widely known as “Papa Kelce,” he has always been a visible and spirited presence in the football world. But his latest step isn’t tied to stadium lights or game-day cameras, it’s a small, personal leap toward healing. Ed recently joined Threads, choosing a creative, lighthearted hobby as a way to reconnect with everyday joy.Ed Kelce’s first post on Threads showcased something more wholesome than football talk. He shared a photo with a young boy named Suleymon, proudly showing off a jacket made at the Ignition Lab by Operation Breakthrough.“My new jacket from the Ignition Lab at Operation Breakthrough, made by Suleymon,” he wrote, giving followers a warm snapshot of community support and creativity. Within an hour, he posted again, this time sharing a quirky photo of a beer-themed trash bin, suggesting he might be using social media to document everyday curiosities rather than big life stories.Even as he grieves, Papa Kelce’s familiar protective side remains intact.With the Chiefs struggling this season and Travis Kelce facing heavy criticism, Ed stepped in with stats to shut down the noise. “If anyone questions how good Travis is playing; through week 10 he leads all tight ends in total yardage,” he posted on Instagram. The message was a reminder that while he is learning to rebuild personally, his loyalty to his son hasn’t dimmed.Travis recorded a career-low 823 yards in 2024 and currently sits at 727 yards with five touchdowns after Week 14, making this one of his toughest stretches. Still, whether the Chiefs claw their way to a playoff spot or fall short, Ed Kelce remains locked in, cheering from the stands and now, sharing life’s smaller moments online.Perhaps his next Threads post won’t just be about a jacket or a clever trash bin, but a proud moment with his son as they weather this season together.Also Read: “Call off the marriage”: Frustrated Chiefs fans urge Travis Kelce to dump Taylor Swift amid growing blame for Kansas City collapse","Ed Kelce, the father of Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis, recently joined Threads.

Why A’ja Wilson chose the Infinity Gauntlet look



A new level of championship energy from A’ja Wilson



A’ja Wilson arrived at the Las Vegas Aces championship parade carrying more than a trophy haul. She walked into Toshiba Plaza with a gold Infinity Gauntlet on her left hand, turning the moment into a bold visual summary of a season that rewrote record books.The accessory captured the scale of her dominance and offered a snapshot of an athlete finally willing to embrace the noise that followed her unmatched run. Every stone represented a milestone, and each one told the league exactly where she now stands.Her celebration quickly became one of the most replayed images from the Aces’ third title run. It stood out because it distilled her year into something fans could instantly understand. A’ja Wilson ruled the moment, collected her achievements at historic speed, and wanted the world to see the truth of her rise. TIME later named her its 2025 Athlete of the Year, and she explainedthe real reason behind wearing the Marvel comic’s villain Thanos’ Gauntlet.Wilson labeled each stone with an honor earned across an unprecedented stretch, starting with her second scoring title, becoming the fastest player in WNBA history to hit 5,000 points, her third Defensive Player of the Year award, a fourth MVP, her second Finals MVP, and a third championship.No player in WNBA or NBA history ever pulled off that full slate in a single season. Even her father, Roscoe, joked about it, saying, “I’m waiting on them to call for the Academy Award and the Emmy. ”The image mattered because Wilson wanted the symbolism to match the reality. Speaking about the choice, she explained, “When you’ve collected everything, that’s Thanos. And this year, I collected everything.” She admitted she rarely leans into self-promotion, preferring her play to take the lead. That changed at the parade. “This was my biggest moment of doing it, because no one’s ever done what I’ve done. And I think people really needed to understand that. ”The moment wasn’t a gimmick. It signaled a superstar stepping into her full power after pushing the Aces through a season that nearly slipped away. Vegas hovered around .500 midseason, then stormed into the playoffs with sixteen straight wins before sweeping Phoenix for another title.TIME’s honor marked her second recognition from the magazine this year, after being named one of its Women of the Year in February.Also Read: ""This is my life partner""- A'ja Wilson drops a massive update about her future wedding plans with Bam Adebayo",A'ja Wilson wore a gold Infinity Gauntlet at the Las Vegas Aces championship parade.
