NEW DELHI: Former England captains Michael Atherton and Nasser Hussain are in awe of Virat Kohli 's impressive ODI statistics and think the Indian mainstay is likely the greatest batsman in the history of the sport.In a Champions Trophy encounter in Dubai on Sunday, Kohli led India to a resounding six-wicket victory over bitter rivals Pakistan with a masterful performance of unbroken 100, his 51st century in ODIs.""Virat Kohli in a run-chase in 50-over cricket, there's been nobody better in the history of the game, really. 51 century is an unbelievable number,"" said the 56-year-old Atherton, who captained England in 54 Test matches, on 'Sky Sports Cricket Podcast'.Kohli joined the select company of Sachin Tendulkar (18,426 in 452 innings) and Kumar Sangakkara (14,234 in 380 innings) as the fastest batter to reach 14,000 ODI runs while en route to his century in his 299th 50-over outing.""I mean, he's got 51 and he passed 14,000 runs, which only Tendulkar and Sangakkara have got past that mark in one-day cricket,"" Atherton continued.""And he got them in 60-odd innings quicker than Sachin, and I think about 90-odd innings quicker than Kumar.""So, I mean, ODI is probably his best. You know, he's been a great all-format player, clearly, but you'd probably say that ODI is his absolute best format.""Hussain, England captain from 1999 to 2003, echoed similar remarks saying, ""He's been an incredible player. Yeah, and you'd have to say probably the best player in ODIs of all time, really, with those stats you mentioned.""You'd have Tendulkar in the same conversation. Kumar, you'd have AB de Villiers . They've been some great ones, but he's right at the top of the tree.""",Former England captains Michael Atherton and Nasser Hussain are in awe of Virat Kohli's impressive ODI statistics.

“Annoying dealing with the media”: Elias Pettersson delivers fiery response to the media after Vancouver Canucks' consecutive losses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/annoying-dealing-with-the-media-elias-pettersson-delivers-fiery-response-to-the-media-after-vancouver-canucks-consecutive-losses/articleshow/118551965.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Elias Pettersson’s performance falls short after major extension



The Vancouver Canucks are facing a significant drop in the 2024-25 NHL season, with Elias Pettersson 's lackluster year being a major factor in their inefficiency. However, Pettersson has grown tired of the constant questioning and is determined to step up consistently.Pettersson recently acknowledged his struggles with a blunt response, showing both frustration and determination as he works to improve during the Canucks’ tough season.Elias Pettersson, who signed an eight-year, $92.8 million contract extension in March 2024, has not lived up to expectations this season. Through 34 games, he has recorded just 10 goals and 18 assists (28 points), a significant dip compared to his usual output. His struggles have raised concerns, especially as the team looks to remain competitive in the playoff race.“It’s more annoying dealing with the media,” Canucks forward Elias Pettersson said, following a question from a Sportsnet reporter about confidence influencing scoring issues.The distractions surrounding the locker room have clearly impacted Pettersson’s performance, and Rick Tocchet ,head coach of Vancouver Canucks, hopes to see his star player regain confidence. Tocchet has observed Pettersson hesitating and overanalyzing his decisions on the ice.“I think he’s waiting for something. I don’t know if it’s a lack of confidence in his shot, but as soon as he has room, he’s got to take it and just got to blast it,” Rick Tocchet admitted after the 2-1 loss at Utah, via Sportsnet. “I’d rather him just rip a puck right now. He’s not moving his feet. I thought today, some shifts he was moving his feet and it looked like we had some glimpses. I don’t know if it’s a mental block right now, all year, but he’s got to move his feet.”With the March 7 trade deadline nearing, speculation about Pettersson’s future is growing. Analysts debate whether the Canucks should trade him for less than his value or keep him, hoping for a rebound.Also Read: Anaheim Ducks' Trevor Zegras suspended for 3 games without pay for interference on Detroit Red Wings' Michael Rasmussen Despite his scoring slump, Pettersson excels defensively, leading forwards with 237 defensive plays and 164 blocked passes, highlighting his two-way impact. As the Canucks push through the second half of the season, Pettersson's performance will be crucial in determining the team’s success and his long-term future with the franchise.","Elias Pettersson signed an eight-year, $92.8 million contract extension in March 2024.

Justin Tucker’s sexual misconduct allegations spark debate over equal treatment with Browns' Deshaun Watson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/justin-tuckers-sexual-misconduct-allegations-spark-debate-over-equal-treatment-with-browns-deshaun-watson/articleshow/118562550.cms,"Image via Ric Tapia/Getty Images

Fans Question Why Is Justin Tucker Not Being Treated Like Deshaun Watson When He Was Accused Of Similar Sexual Misconduct Charges



Justin Tucker Has Denied All The Sexual Misconduct Allegations That He Has Been Accused Of



Justin Tucker, the star player of the Baltimore Ravens, has found himself in a huge controversy after massage therapists working at luxury spas accused him of inappropriate sexual behaviour, as per The Baltimore Banner. The Baltimore Banner reports that as many as sixteen women have accused the player of sexual misconduct and this seems like a flashback to when the Cleveland Browns’ Deshaun Watson was accused of a similar crime a few years back. Fans have questions about how the Justin Tucker situation is being handled as compared to Deshaun Watson’s.A fan took to X and wrote, “I’m still waiting on the world and sports media to drag Justin Tucker as they did Deshawn Watson keep that same energy!”, while another fan wrote, “Why is this not on the news like Deshawn Watson was. Deshawn was on national and local news on the reg. Why is Justin Tucker not being talked about more on national, local news and social media? Maybe he kept missing them field goals cause he was too ‘relaxed’ 🤷🏽‍♂️”A third fan wrote, “the fact the nfl allowed deshawn watson continue playing football is disturbing. now you’ve got justin tucker who has allegations that are getting near deshawn’s numbers. what number of women will be enough?”In 2021, Deshaun Watson was accused by more than twenty massage therapists of inappropriate sexual misconduct. It caused a huge uproar on social media and became a topic for debate. At that point in time, Deshaun Watson was playing for the Houston Texans.While his contract with the Houston Texans was not officially terminated, he did not play in any of the matches during the 2021 season of the NFL.By 2022, Deshaun Watson was traded to the Cleveland Browns but he was suspended for the first 11 matches during the 2022 season of the NFL and was fined a whopping $5 million. By November 2022, he was back to playing for the Cleveland Browns.The accusations against Deshaun Watson are oddly similar to the accusations against Baltimore Ravens’ Justin Tucker. After the women approached The Baltimore Banner with their story, Justin Tucker issued a statement regarding the controversy and denied all the allegations levied against him.In a social media statement, Justin Tucker said, “In accusing me of misconduct, the article takes innocuous, or ambiguous, interactions and skews them so out of proportion they are no longer recognizable, and it presents vague insinuations as fact. This is desperate tabloid fodder.”As per The Baltimore Banner, the NFL has started their investigations into the matter and is interviewing the women who have accused the Baltimore Ravens’ player.Also Read: Travis Kelce breaks his social media silence amid Taylor Swift's follower drop and gives fans hope","Justin Tucker, the star player of the Baltimore Ravens, has found himself in a huge controversy after massage therapists working at luxury spas accused him of inappropriate sexual behaviour.

In 2024, he had 255 carries, 1,138 rushing yards, five rushing touchdowns, and 51 receptions for 408 yards and two touchdowns.""The big thing for me is we loved having Aaron Jones, the impact he had,"" coach Kevin O'Connell told SiriusXM earlier this month. ""For the better part of his career, he had kind of been a part of backfield committees, but for the most part, Aaron Jones was the feature back [in 2024]. ... So I would love to have Aaron back. And then we just continue to grow in that room, whether it's infusing a young player in the draft or maybe another player in free agency alongside Aaron Jones, hopefully.""O'Connell's vision for the 2024 season was evident in a Week 1 victory over the New York Giants, where quarterback Ryan Jones played 52% of snaps and carried the ball 14 times for 94 yards and a touchdown. However, the Vikings lost faith in Chandler and Jones became more of an every-down player, playing 63% of offensive snaps and taking 67% of carries by running backs.Aaron Jones expressed his desire to return to Minnesota in 2025, following the Vikings' wild-card loss to the Los Angeles Rams. ""We'll see how it plays out,"" he added, ""but this is where I want to be."" Jones, despite being best suited for rotational roles, is a top option in a presumptive free agent class alongside Najee Harris, J.K. Dobbins, Rico Dowdle, Javonte Williams, and Akers. His $7 million contract ranked 14th among running backs in average per year, and he could attract multiple suitors.Also read: Former New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers has shared two key qualities he is seeking in his next team ESPN's Field Yates ranks Boise State's Ashton Jeanty, Iowa's Kaleb Johnson, North Carolina's Omarion Hampton, Ohio State's TreVeyon Henderson, and Georgia's Trevor Etienne as the top five available running backs in the draft, with the Vikings having the lowest total draft capital in the NFL.","Vikings plan to reduce Aaron Jones’ playing time if he returns to Minnesota. Jones set career highs in touches, carries, and offensive snaps in his first season. Despite injuries, Jones managed to play all 18 games and had the most rushing yards and second-most yards from scrimmage.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118506798,imgsize-48622,width-400,resizemode-4/118506798.jpg"

Also read:

The Rock's return and recent confrontation with Cody Rhodes on SmackDown has possibly changed the trajectory of the road to WrestleMania 41.The road to WrestleMania 41 took a surprising turn with the return of The Final Boss, The Rock, on the February 21st edition of SmackDown. He made the announcement a day before the show and teased what the fans could expect from his shocking re-emergence.The Final came back to SmackDown, taking place in New Orleans, Louisiana, first to deliver the big gift he teased by announcing that the city will be the host to WrestleMania 42 next year. Right after, he called out the WWE Champion, Cody Rhodes. The American Nightmare came down to the ring and embraced The Rock in a show of respect.The Rock revealed that he had a deep respect for Cody Rhodes' remarkable reign as champion and his rise as the face of WWE. Witnessing that, The Final Boss made an offer to Cody to become ""his champion.""

Cody Rhodes is set to deliver his answer to The Rock at the WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 event.During the segment, Cody Rhodes said that he was the champion of fans but still did not give a nod of refusal to The Rock's offer. Regardless, their confrontation reignited the conversation of a match between The Rock and Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 41.

While the match seems very unlikely, it does not rule out the fact that The Rock can be involved in some capacity in the title picture at The Show of Shows.Should Cody Rhodes refuse his offer at the Elimination Chamber, The Rock could use his power as a TKO Board member to extend the same offer to another star and insert him into the WWE title.

Houston Rockets injury report for tonight’s game against the Milwaukee Bucks (February 25, 2025)

When and where to watch the Milwaukee Bucks play tonight against the Houston Rockets (February 25, 2025)?

Theare gearing up for a crucial matchup against the Houston Rockets on Tuesday, February 25, at the Toyota Center, but all eyes are on’s injury status. The two-time MVP is listed as probable due to a calf issue, raising questions about his availability and potential impact on the game. Giannis Antetokounmpo , who leads the Bucks with 31.0 points and 12.0 rebounds per game, has been a cornerstone of Milwaukee’s success this season. His probable status suggests he is likely to suit up, but the calf injury could limit his minutes or effectiveness. The Bucks, currently 32-24, will need their star at full strength to counter a Rockets team that boasts a strong defensive record, allowing just 109.0 points per game (fifth in the NBA).The injury report also highlights other key absences for Milwaukee. Pat Connaughton remains out with a calf injury, while Gary Trent Jr. is probable with a knee issue. These setbacks could test the Bucks’ depth, especially against a Rockets squad that has been dominant on the boards, leading the league with 47.9 rebounds per game.For Houston, injuries are also a concern. Fred VanVleet (ankle), Jae’Sean Tate (back), and Dillon Brooks (illness) are all questionable, while Cody Zeller is out for personal reasons. Despite these challenges, the Rockets have been formidable, outscoring opponents by 3.9 points per game, thanks in large part to Jalen Green’s team-leading 21.5 points per game.The Bucks, however, have their own strengths. They rank 12th in the NBA in scoring (114.2 points per game) and sixth in three-pointers made (14.4 per game), with Damian Lillard contributing 3.5 threes per contest. Giannis Antetokounmpo’s presence will be critical in maintaining this offensive rhythm, especially against a Rockets defense that has been stingy all season.Also read: Will Kevin Durant play tonight against the Memphis Grizzlies? Latest update on the Phoenix Suns star's injury report (February 25, 2025) As tip-off approaches, the Bucks’ medical staff will likely monitor Antetokounmpo’s condition closely.

Jimmy Butler ’s integration into the Golden State Warriors’ system has been nothing short of spectacular.

Remarkably, he’s been able to put up these numbers despite struggling from beyond the arc, shooting only 10% from three.

Warriors’ star player Stephen Curry also hailed the management’s decision to acquire the former Heat star.""There's a sense of urgency just because you're not going to be able to do it at this level forever. We talked about that pre-trade, which is why Jimmy is here, and we all love the expectations, we love playing for something meaningful, and the only energy you're putting out there is to try and get it done. That's it. We're in a moment where we still can win.""Also Read: Did Jimmy Butler Take a Dig at Miami Heat?

Steelers face crucial decision on George Pickens’ future



George Pickens' Top Plays of 2023 | Pittsburgh Steelers

Steelers offseason moves make way for crucial 2025



The Pittsburgh Steelers are heading into a crucial offseason with big decisions on the horizon. Among them, the future of wide receiver George Pickens stands out as a top priority. With his rookie contract nearing its end, the Steelers must decide whether to secure their dynamic playmaker long-term or take a wait-and-see approach.The Pittsburgh Steelers are entering a defining offseason, and one of the biggest storylines revolves around George Pickens. As the explosive wide receiver heads into the final year of his rookie contract, the burning question is; will Pittsburgh lock him in for the long haul, or could they risk losing one of their most electrifying playmakers?Steelers GM Omar Khan wasted no time shutting down any doubts about Pickens’ future in Pittsburgh.“He has a desire to be great. He has a desire to be great here. We have a desire for him to be great and to be great here,” Khan stated in a recent press conference, making it clear that both sides are aligned in their vision for success. (Via: EssentiallySports)Pickens has already established himself as a difference-maker, racking up 59 catches for 900 yards and three touchdowns last season. His ability to stretch the field and make jaw-dropping catches has made him a fan favorite. However, while his talent is unquestionable, concerns about consistency and maturity have surfaced. Despite that, the Steelers remain fully committed to his development and keeping him in black and gold beyond 2025.Now, the pressure is on. Do the Steelers secure Pickens with a lucrative extension, or let him play out his deal and risk losing a rising star? Given his impact and sky-high potential, locking him in seems like the smart move. But with salary cap limitations and other priorities in play, Pittsburgh faces a major decision,one that could shape the franchise’s future for years to come.Also Read: Falcons GM’s $10M decision signals Kirk cousins’ future as Michael Penix Jr. gets clear QB1 message The Steelers have more than just George Pickens’ contract to sort out. A major quarterback dilemma looms with Russell Wilson and Justin Fields both in the mix. Wilson, who joined on a one-year deal after Denver cut him, posted 2,482 yards, 16 touchdowns, and five interceptions in 2024. Solid, but not elite.Wilson wants to stay, and reports suggest team owner Art Rooney II favors him over Fields. Fields, who spent most of last season as a backup, managed 1,106 yards, five touchdowns, and one interception in limited action. Now, the Steelers must choose between the proven veteran or the younger option.Pittsburgh is also making key roster moves. Cutting linebacker Preston Smith hints at a defensive shift, while signing defensive back Cameron McCutcheon and running back Jonathan Ward adds depth. These moves may not make headlines but strengthen the roster.Then there’s T.J. Watt. Entering the final year of his contract, he remains a dominant force, though an ankle injury slowed him late last season. His future is a major storyline. Will the Steelers extend him or let things play out?The Steelers' offseason is far from quiet. With Pickens’ contract talks, the QB battle, and roster adjustments, the front office has big decisions ahead. Every move will be closely watched as they gear up for 2025.",Pittsburgh Steelers are heading into a crucial offseason with big decisions on the horizon.

Travis Kelce: Travis Kelce's Future: Chiefs GM Brett Veach Confirms He's “Fired Up” for 2025 Season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-kelces-future-chiefs-gm-brett-veach-confirms-hes-fired-up-for-2025-season/articleshow/118565450.cms,"Credit: Imagn Images

Travis Kelce's Competitive Fire Still Burning, Says Brett Veach

""He’s got one year left on his contract, and I know he's still fired up. There's no timeline for him to decide, but as far as we're concerned, we're planning to have him back and ready to roll.""

Travis Kelce Is All Set to Make a Comeback After Super Bowl Setback

""I owe it to my team to give 100%.""

What's at Stake for the Chiefs?

Looks like Travis Kelce isn’t ready to ride off into the sunset just yet! According to Kansas City Chiefs General Manager Brett Veach, the star tight end is pumped about returning for the 2025 season — and the team is just as excited to have him back.Fresh off the Chiefs' tough 40-22 Super Bowl LIX loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, there were whispers about Kelce possibly retiring. But Veach quickly put those rumors to rest during the NFL Scouting Combine, revealing that Kelce still has the hunger to play.Veach told the reportersTravis is also pumped up to make a comeback. Speaking on his ""New Heights"" podcast earlier this month, Kelce admitted he's taking time to figure things out.Kelce’s 2024 season was solid, but by his high standards, it wasn’t his best. He notched 97 catches for 823 yards and three touchdowns in 16 regular-season games — his lowest numbers since his rookie year. The Super Bowl itself was a quiet night for the veteran, with just four receptions for 39 yards.Despite that, Kelce still showed flashes of brilliance, including a standout performance against the Houston Texans in the divisional round, racking up 117 yards and a touchdown.Financially, Kelce’s decision carries weight. He has a $19.8 million cap hit for 2025, with an $11.5 million roster bonus due on March 15. If he retires before then, the Chiefs could save $17.25 million in cap space.But money aside, the Chiefs know Kelce’s value goes far beyond stats. His leadership and chemistry with Patrick Mahomes are crucial as they gear up for another championship run.For now, it seems all signs point to Kelce running it back for another season — but with the March 15 roster bonus deadline looming, his final decision could come sooner rather than later.Also read - He shouldn’t: Rob Gronkowski’s possible NFL return leaves fans with mixed emotions and strong opinions","Travis Kelce has one year left on his contract with the Kansas City Chiefs.

Trevor Zegras: NHL Fans Slam Officiating After Trevor Zegras’ Brutal Hit on Michael Rasmussen Leads to Suspension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-fans-slam-officiating-after-trevor-zegras-brutal-hit-on-michael-rasmussen-leads-to-suspension/articleshow/118560189.cms,"NHL: Anaheim Ducks at Detroit Red Wings

NHL Hands Trevor Zegras a 3-Game Suspension Without Pay

“Players who are not in possession of the puck are never eligible to be checked… Contact is made outside the window where a check may be legally finished. In addition to the lateness, what causes this hit to rise to the level of supplemental discipline is the significant head contact on this play, combined with the force.”

NHL Fans Slam Refs for Ignoring the Hit During the Game

So he’s going to have a “hearing” about the hit, but none of the refs called a penalty on it?! Is that how we want the games to be reffed? Trust me, I’m all for a physical game, but aiming for a guys head with him not looking? That’s unsportsmanlike behavior

“There wasn’t even a call on this. That ref crew was atrocious.”

Sunday night at the Little Caesars Arena was anything but ordinary. The Detroit Red Wings may have clinched an overtime win against the Anaheim Ducks , but all eyes were glued to one incident — Trevor Zegras ’ brutal hit on Michael Rasmussen . The shocking shoulder-to-head blow left hockey fans reeling, and now, the NHL has stepped in with a decision that’s only fueled the fire.The controversy peaked when Ducks forward Trevor Zegras delivered a high hit to Red Wings center Michael Rasmussen during the second period. Rasmussen, clearly not in possession of the puck, was blindsided by Zegras — a move that instantly sparked outrage.The NHL’s Department of Player Safety didn’t hold back. Zegras has now been slapped with a 3-game suspension without pay, a punishment accompanied by a fine of $89,844 — a dent in his nearly $6 million salary. The league clarified their stance, stating:While this marks Zegras’ first suspension since being drafted in 2019, the ruling hasn’t exactly settled the storm.Despite the vicious hit, what really ignited fan fury was the referees' failure to call a penalty during the game. Many fans didn’t hold back, accusing the refs of dropping the ball. One fan fumed on social media:.”Another questioned how the refs let it slide even after reviewing the replay:Zegras himself seemed to deny the severity of the hit, visibly shaking his head after the replay aired. But fans weren’t buying it — and their anger has now shifted not just toward the player, but the officials.With Trevor Zegras benched for the next three games, the Ducks will have to push forward without one of their key forwards. But the bigger issue seems to lie ahead for the NHL. Fan distrust in officiating is growing, and this latest incident only adds more fuel to the fire.For now, all eyes remain on how both the league and the referees handle future controversial plays — because fans are clearly watching every move.Also read - Player Injuries at 4 Nations Tournament Raise Red Flags for NHL’s 2026 Olympic Participation",Trevor Zegras has been suspended for 3 games without pay for a high hit on Michael Rasmussen.

NHL Fans Are Frustrated With Commissioner Gary Bettman for Reducing Ryan Hartman’s Suspension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-fans-are-frustrated-with-commissioner-gary-bettman-for-reducing-ryan-hartmans-suspension/articleshow/118562209.cms,"Image via Getty images

Gary Bettman draws heavy criticism from NHL fans.



What Message Is the NHL Sending?

The NHL is bruised once again as Commissioner Gary Bettman stands neck-deep in the storm. Minnesota Wild forward Ryan Hartman received the original 10-game suspension following his reckless play in slamming Ottawa Senators’ Tim Stützle’s head to the ice during a face-off. The NHL’s Department of Player Safety condemned it as a dangerous and unacceptable act. Then came the shocking twist: Bettman cut the suspension to eight games after an appeal, sending fans into an uproar for what they see as leniency for a repeat offender.Hartman is no stranger to NHL punishment. Throughout his career, even numerous suspensions and fines have welcomed him, including one early in 2024 for high-sticking another player and a two-game suspension for tripping Alex DeBrincat in 2023. Hartman's many instances of reckless play have often drawn many fans and analysts' interest in giving Hartman another nickname: the most penalized player in the NHL. The Wild organization and its fan base did not argue against that suspension.Regardless, Bettman's decision to temper the punishment after an appeal did not sit well with the hockey community. Fans went on social media to vent their anger. One fan noted, “This is a terrible look for the NHL. Even Wild fans agreed with the 10-game suspension. Hartman hasn’t learned anything!” Others chimed in about inconsistencies in the way the league hands down punishment, one going so far as to say, “Good thing he didn’t break Stützle’s neck, or they might’ve reduced it to six games.”Bettman, while acknowledging Hartman had a long list of past bad acts, opted nonetheless to lessen the suspension. This does raise serious questions about his view of player safety and only increases the chorus of critics suggesting the NHL is not consistent in its punishment calls.Also read: NHL's 4 Nations Face-Off, featuring Team USA and Team Canada, stole the show from the NBA's All-Star weekend, drawing a record-breaking TV audience With Hartman’s history of reckless behavior, many feel that this ruling sends an incorrect message—that repeat offenders may still have their penalties rolled back. At a time when the league is trying to emphasize player safety, Bettman's decision surely casts doubt in fans' minds on that account.",Minnesota Wild forward Ryan Hartman received the original 10-game suspension following his reckless play in slamming Ottawa Senators’ Tim Stützle’s head to the ice during a face-off.

Brennan Othmann is promoted by the Rangers as Chris Kreider's condition remains unclear,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/brennan-othmann-is-promoted-by-the-rangers-as-chris-kreiders-condition-remains-unclear/articleshow/118559248.cms,"Image via Getty Images



Brennan Othmann Looks to Make an Impact

Rangers Hunting Down Playoff Push In Major Stretch

A young prospect called up on Chris Kreider's injury site. The Rangers have called Othmann from AHL Hartford Wolf Pack as they await updates on veteran forward Chris Kreider's availability. Kreider, who was an unlucky scratch for the team's Sunday match against the Pittsburgh Penguins because of an upper-body injury, is marked as day-to-day. As the Rangers fight a playoff race, they are ensuring they will have at least one extra forward available heading into Tuesday's clash with the New York Islanders. The next series of transactions on opponents will keep the team rolling during the important weeks left in the season.The 22-year-old first-round selection for the Rangers in the 2021 NHL Draft has been one of the best players in the AHL this season. He has not yet got on the scoresheet in three games with the Rangers early in January but has 12 goals and 8 assists over 27 games, showing off his offensive side. It gives him one more opportunity to show himself at the top level, especially if Kreider remains out.Along with this, Othmann's ascent quickly changed the face of the Rangers' defense, calling Zac Jones from his AHL conditioning assignment while sending Matthew Robertson back to Hartford. Jones, 24, has played 28 games with the Rangers this season, averaging over 16 minutes per game and strengthening the blue line for the final stretch of regular-season games.The Rangers have 25 remaining games in the season, and at the moment, they are two points away from a wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference. Generally, the latest spell in this season has been pretty scattered, such as the previous thunderous loss of 8-2 against Buffalo, followed by the successful comeback against Pittsburgh. Naturally, the concern over the health of Kreider adds to the hurdles, but it opens the door for more young flames, such as Othmann.Also read: NHL insider reports that multiple teams, including the Toronto Maple Leafs are interested in Carolina Hurricanes forward Mikko Rantanen Every game becomes a must-win as his team battles for a place in the postseason. Othmann's recall is a clear signal of a need for reinforcements, but it also serves as an opportunity for him to etch his name in the history of the NHL. If he can capitalize on the opportunity afforded by this case, it may very well be a defining moment for both of them amid the push for postseason glory.",Brennan Othmann has been called up by the Rangers from the Hartford Wolf Pack.

Stephen A. Smith’s blunt take on Nick Nurse’s tough season

Stephen A. is CONCERNED about the 76ers 👀 ‘THERE IS NO HOPE!’ 🗣️ | First Take

The Philadelphia 76ers entered the 2024-25 season with championship aspirations, bolstered by the addition of nine-time All-Star Paul George . With a strong roster, expectations were sky-high. However, reality has been far less kind. Instead of competing for a title, the Sixers find themselves in freefall, suffering an eight-game losing streak capped off by a crushing 142-110 loss to the Chicago Bulls on Monday night.The struggles have drawn concern from analysts and fans alike, and none more vocal than ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith . On ""First Take,"" Smith didn’t hold back in expressing sympathy for head coach Nick Nurse , even suggesting some unconventional coping methods for the embattled coach.After yet another demoralizing defeat, Stephen A. Smith couldn’t help but empathize with Nurse, who took the Sixers’ job hoping to lead them to contention. Instead, he’s been dealt a nightmare season riddled with setbacks.""I'm getting concerned about Nick Nurse,"" Smith admitted. ""You have heard me say, 'Stay off the weeeeed!' But at this point, I’m encouraging him to get on some based on everything I’ve heard it does… Damn it, go ahead and use it.""Smith, in his signature comedic yet pointed style, went on to emphasize just how dire things have gotten for the Sixers’ head coach.""Let him drink, let him smoke some weed. Let him do whatever because this coach right here—you can't be more depressed than this man is.""While Smith’s words were lighthearted, the Sixers’ issues are no joke. Much of their downfall can be attributed to the absence of reigning MVP Joel Embiid , whose knee injury has significantly derailed the season.Philadelphia 76ers’ playoff hopes hang by a thread as Joel Embiid’s injury and Paul George’s struggles take a toll Joel Embiid has only appeared in 19 games this season, and his availability moving forward remains uncertain. The Sixers’ star last played on Saturday against the Brooklyn Nets, logging just 31 minutes and scoring 14 points. He was absent against the Bulls, and after the game, Nurse was asked whether Embiid might have already played his last game this season.""Not at that point at all,"" Nurse responded. ""We are playing and testing and trying to figure it out and go from there.""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSN6zTmL6D8&t=2sNurse added that Embiid has multiple tests scheduled to evaluate his knee, leaving the team in limbo. If he doesn’t return, it would mark a new career-low in games played for Embiid, surpassing the 31 games he played as a rookie.Meanwhile, Paul George , the marquee offseason acquisition, has yet to live up to expectations. The veteran forward is averaging just 16.2 points per game—his lowest since his second year in the league (excluding the injury-shortened 2014-15 season). With Embiid sidelined and George underperforming, the Sixers’ offense has lacked the firepower needed to compete at the highest level.The Sixers are at a crossroads. While Nurse remains hopeful about Embiid’s return, uncertainty looms large. If their MVP is forced to sit out the remainder of the season, Philadelphia will need to find solutions fast to avoid an even deeper collapse.Also Read: Paul George Reacts to Los Angeles Lakers’ Failed Mark Williams Trade: ""Thank God It Didn’t Happen"" As the losses pile up, frustration continues to mount. But if one thing is clear, it’s that the Sixers’ season has not gone according to plan—and as Stephen A. Smith humorously pointed out, Nick Nurse may need all the help he can get to weather this storm.","The Philadelphia 76ers entered the 2024-25 season with championship aspirations, bolstered by the addition of nine-time All-Star Paul George.

India dominate Dutch as Savita heroics win bonus point,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/hockey/top-stories/india-dominate-dutch-as-savita-heroics-win-bonus-point/articleshow/118570497.cms,"BHUBANESWAR: The Netherlands women's hockey team is not only the undisputed world No. 1 side, but they are also the current two-time Olympic champions. Their loss against Argentina in December was only their second loss in 2024 and just their 20th loss since the Athens Olympics.The numbers are quite mind boggling and they continued their domination after coming down to India. In their first two matches, they hammered England 5-1 and 6-0 respectively and one couldn't help but be a little worried about what awaited the Indian side.But India's women's hockey team put on a show to remember to hold the Netherlands to a 2-2 draw before Savita helped them earn the bonus point thanks to winning the shoot-outs 2-1 at Kalinga Stadium here on Tuesday.It came a day after they went down 2-4 to the same opponents despite a top-notch performance.On Tuesday, India were trailing 0-2 at half-time but first Deepika and then Baljeet Kaur scored two brilliant goals to help India hold the Dutch.It was five minutes into the third quarter when Sunelita Toppo released Deepika on the left and she turned on the afterburners and made a run down the flanks. Upon entering the D, she made good use of some 3D skills to get the ball past the defender and finally put the ball above the goalkeeper and into the net.It was marvellous and the crowd erupted with joy.Eight minutes later, the second goal came. This time Sharmila Devi collected a long through pass, made a run down the right and played the ball to Baljeet. She sprinted towards the goal and played it past the Dutch goalkeeper and into the net.The Dutch turned on the heat in the final quarter, but India kept them at bay and won the shoot-outs where Savita saved four of their five shots on the night.India down England: Harmanpreet Singh scored twice from the penalty corners as India beat England 2-1 in the last game of the FIH Pro League mini tournament at Kalinga Stadium here on Tuesday night.It was the first time that the Indian captain scored in the tournament, and he was pumped after finding the net on both occasions. Conor Williamson converted a penalty stroke at the stroke of half-time for England's lone strike.Meanwhile, the game came to an end in what was a comedy of errors. There was a small tussle between the players, and it seemed the match was over. But the umpires went for a video review even as the fireworks went off. The players waited amid all this as the entire stadium was engulfed in a blanket of smoke. Finally, nothing came off the review and India bagged their fifth win of the tournament.",India's women's hockey team put on a show to remember to hold the Netherlands to a 2-2 draw.

Alex Ovechkin reaches 30-goal milestone

Alex Ovechkin has reached 30 goals for the 19th time in his 20-year NHL career , building on the record he established last season. Washington Capitals captain reached the milestone Tuesday night against the Calgary Flames when he scored a power-play goal in the first minute of the third period.

The Washington Capitals captain reached this milestone in a 3-1 home defeat to the Calgary Flames on Tuesday evening.He shot a one-timer by Dan Vladar on the power play midway through the third period, sparking chants of ""Ovi! Ovi!"" from the crowd. With this milestone, Ovechkin becomes part of an elite group of players, including Teemu Selanne, Johnny Bucyk, and Gordie Howe, who scored 30 goals in a season at age 39 or older, with Howe doing it three times.As per ESPN Research, Ovechkin hit the 30-goal mark in only 42 games this year, which is fifth-quickest in his career. He has now moved even further ahead of other 30-goal ers in NHL history. Second on the list is Mike Gartner with 17 seasons at the milestone, and in third is Jaromir Jagr with 15.With his 883rd goal, Ovechkin is 12 shy of tying Wayne Gretzky's all-time mark of 894, which once was considered impenetrable.

Champions Trophy: 'Any victory against Pakistan is sweet,' says Shreyas Iyer

While Group A of the ICC Champions Trophy has already confirmed its two semi-finalists in the form of India and New Zealand, things are heating up in Group B after the washed-out Australia vs South Africa match on Tuesday, which has kept the race to the semis wide open.The winners of the match between the Proteas and the Aussies would have given Group B one of its two semi-finalists, but with the two teams splitting points in Rawalpindi, where rain didn't even allow the toss to happen, hopes have renewed for England and Afghanistan who will face off on Wednesday at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore.Both England and Afghanistan are without points after defeats in their opening games against Australia and South Africa, respectively, who have three points each.But as things stand currently in Group B, England and Afghanistan have a game more in hand and the result on Wednesday will keep the winning team close on the heels of the Australians and the Proteas. On the other side, curtains will come down on the campaign of the losing team.That makes match number eight of this Champions Trophy a knockout fixture for the Afghans and the English team.A couple of factors that could decide the winner on Wednesday could be the flat deck in Lahore and the late-evening dew.With runs on offer on a placid track, the team winning the toss would want to chase. The other reason for batting second in Lahore is the dew factor that makes bowling under the lights a difficult task, as was seen in the match between Australia and England that saw the Aussies chase down a formidable target of 352 runs.","England and Afghanistan will face off in the Champions Trophy on Wednesday.
