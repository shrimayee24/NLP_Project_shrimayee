Rams Vs. Eagles Game: An NFL Player Misbehaves with Matthew Stafford’s Wife Kelly Stafford During Rams vs. Eagles Game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/an-nfl-player-misbehaves-with-matthew-staffords-wife-kelly-stafford-during-rams-vs-eagles-game/articleshow/117563441.cms,"Kelly Stafford, wife of Rams' quarterback, faced taunting from an ex-NFL player during a divisional round game against the Philadelphia Eagles. The behavior included disrespectful mocking gestures, even in front of her daughter, leaving her visibly disturbed. Despite the negative encounter, Kelly acknowledged the support from other Eagles fans and stressed the importance of respect, especially when children are present.

From Where It All Started



""I fully thought this was a fan that was acting a certain way,"" Kelly said. [5:30] ""He was in the suite next to us and he was kind of just taunting a little bit, which, you know, you understand. But then, when I was told that he was an ex-player, it really baffled me. I expected it from a fan, I didn't really engage. But to get it from an ex-player and a supposed legend, I don't know what that means. Philadelphia has, like, Philadelphia legends, I guess.""

The Morning After Detroit Will Smith

""He was taunting the whole suite, which was honestly again, if you're a fan, I got it. We were all in LA gear, like totally understand it. But then he was doing the loser sign and my girls were sitting right there,""

""I did not expect this from an ex-player,""

The Los Angeles Rams’ divisional round game against the Philadelphia Eagles wasn’t just a loss on the scoreboard for Kelly Stafford—it turned into a deeply unsettling experience thanks to a former NFL player’s behavior. In the midst of the Rams not doing much better on the field, Kelly suddenly found herself confronting the ex-player, whose action quickly escalated what she thought could be just some aggressive fan behavior and turned into much more offensive in nature.As though that would be enough, it all started turning bad very soon when the player continued to disrespect the family. At one point in front of an entire suite, he mimicked her and also her family in a mock that even involved a ""loser"" sign—a thing Kelly did not like so much since there was her daughter beside her.she continued. It's one thing to mess with people who know what they are getting themselves into, but to include kids in that, NOT COOL.Kelly was visibly disturbed by the whole incident and showed her frustration over the ex-player's actions.she said. It is a game, but there is a level of respect you should have for others, especially when kids are involved.The confrontation didn't end there, but Kelly made it clear that she was more focused on her family's well-being than engaging in the drama. Though she didn't name the former player, she made it known that his behavior was completely out of line. This incident shed light on the fact that how players and their families had to face criticism publicly, how their mental health gets ignored and no one gives a shit about their privacy.Despite the bitter encounter, Kelly took a moment to highlight the bright aspects of her experience. She thanked the majority of the kindness shown by many Eagles fans who embraced her and her family with open arms. Respect and thoughtfulness on game day left a great impression, showcasing the true spirit of sportsmanship. But the unpleasant episode stayed in her mind because, this time it had come from where she least expected. This duality of emotions, feeling gratitude for the good and disappointment over the bad, seemed to encapsulate the complexities of belonging to such a passionate sports culture.Also read - To Avenge Travis Kelce, You Won’t Believe Who His Ex Kayla Nicole is Supporting in the NFL Now—It’s NOT the Chiefs!","Kelly Stafford, wife of Rams' quarterback, faced taunting from an ex-NFL player during a divisional round game against the Philadelphia Eagles.

""I don’t think you’re going to be able to take a breath anywhere.

Brandon Nimmo with Joe Benigno & Sal Licata

""And I think what I did is I made too many adjustments from that point. So I think one of the things is, um, you know, again, you continue to learn, uh, from being in this game ... And so, um, trying to be a little more consistent with that and stay the course rather than pivot after, you know, a couple of weeks of not seeing the results that we want.""

Travis Kelce’s dramatic flop sparks controversy in AFC Championship game



The Kansas City Chiefs and the Buffalo Bills have always shared a fierce rivalry, and their AFC Championship game was no exception. Tensions flared in the second quarter when Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, known for his trash talk, engaged in a heated exchange with Bills defenders after a Chiefs touchdown.The AFC Championship game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Buffalo Bills delivered intense action and a moment of unexpected theatrics. During the second quarter, the Chiefs turned a three-point deficit into an 11-point lead with back-to-back touchdowns, sparking frustrations on the Bills’ sideline. The tension escalated into a heated scuffle involving Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce, Bills safety Damar Hamlin, and defensive lineman Jordan Phillips.The altercation began after Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes executed a one-yard touchdown run with 1:55 remaining in the half, electrifying the Arrowhead Stadium crowd. Kelce, known for his fiery on-field persona, confronted several Bills defenders, appearing to exchange words with Hamlin. As the verbal sparring continued, Phillips stepped in to defend his teammate.In a move that drew widespread attention, Phillips lightly shoved Kelce in retaliation. Kelce, however, made the moment unforgettable by selling the contact with a theatrical backward fall, his hands flailing in dramatic fashion. The “flop” instantly drew a flag from the officials, who penalized Phillips for unnecessary roughness, resulting in a 15-yard penalty enforced on the ensuing extra point. Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker converted the chip shot, extending Kansas City’s lead.This incident was reminiscent of similar accusations aimed at Mahomes during the divisional round against the Houston Texans, where he was accused of embellishing contact during a sideline play. While Kelce’s flop didn’t significantly impact the game’s outcome, it added fuel to the already intense rivalry between the two teams.The penalty didn’t faze the Bills for long. Instead, Buffalo channeled their frustrations into a determined offensive response. On the very next drive, they marched down the field to score, trimming the Chiefs’ lead to five points just before halftime. The touchdown momentarily silenced the raucous Arrowhead Stadium crowd and reignited hope for Bills fans.Also Read: Eagles Smash Playoff Records With 55-23 Victory Over Commanders, Secure Fifth Super Bowl Berth in Franchise History Although Kelce’s dramatic performance may not win him an Oscar, it undoubtedly became a talking point in the game.

fans are keeping a close eye onas the team prepares for a crucial stretch in the season. The star guard, who has been a key player for the Kings, is currently dealing with an undisclosed issue that could impact his availability for upcoming games. De'Aaron Fox , who is averaging 25.1 points per game this season, ranks 13th in the league in scoring. His absence would be a significant setback for Sacramento, which is looking to maintain its playoff position in the Western Conference. Despite the concern, the Sacramento Kings remain optimistic about his recovery timeline.According to recent reports, Fox's injury status is being monitored on a day-to-day basis. The team has not yet provided a definitive timeline for his return, but sources close to the situation suggest that he may miss a few games as a precautionary measure. Sacramento's coaching staff has emphasized the importance of De'Aaron Fox's long-term health over short-term gains.In Fox's absence, the Sacramento Kings will rely heavily on Domantas Sabonis, Malik Monk, and DeMar DeRozan to step up and fill the scoring void. Sabonis, who leads the league in rebounding with 14.4 boards per game, has been a crucial presence in the paint, while Monk's ability to knock down three-pointers and create plays has provided additional support.Sacramento currently sits with a 23-22 record, ranking sixth in the NBA in scoring with an average of 117 points per game. The team has managed to stay competitive despite facing various challenges throughout the season. However, with De'Aaron Fox potentially sidelined, the Sacramento Kings will need to tighten up defensively, as they currently allow 115 points per game, ranking 21st in the league.Fans are hopeful for Fox's swift return, given his importance to the team's offense and leadership on the court. Sacramento's upcoming schedule includes tough matchups that will test their depth and resilience.

""The first thing I did was start crying right after we won. I just felt like my team's hard work had finally paid off, just four years of working so hard towards a common goal. I think it's so special to have a group of young women all have a common goal in mind and then work to reach that goal and then win. That is so rewarding.""

""Being a young girl going through puberty, it’s hard to be in a leotard. The whole sport of gymnastics is having people judge you, and I just think that’s something not a lot of people talk about. Yes, I’m confident in myself, but it’s something I still struggle with to this day,""

WWE Royal Rumble is the first major event of 2025 which will kick off the company’s spectacular yearly PLE calendar. Apart from the two Royal Rumble matches at the event, a few championship matches will also be featured at this year’s PLE.Considering that the event is an important one, it’s worth noting that major storyline shifts can be expected at the Royal Rumble. So here’s a list of all the matches that have been announced for this PLE on February 1, 2025 and our predictions for who’s set to win them.The following matches have been announced for the event so far:The Women’s Royal Rumble is an interesting mix and it is hard to predict the winner because a lot of big names might just end up appearing at the event. With Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair’s return imminent, it’ll be interesting to see if they make it to the match to begin with.Considering that Tiffany Stratton’s being pushed for a match at WrestleMania, it’s likely that Charlotte Flair picks up the win, should she show up at the Rumble. Bianca Belair is also being considered for a win, but she’s still involved in a tag team scenario so she might have to sit out on this victory.Charlotte Flair wins.One of the most anticipated matches of the night, the Men’s Royal Rumble will see some of the biggest names of the company fighting it out for a championship shot at the Show of Shows, WrestleMania.Ideally, if The Rock does end up showing in the match, then he’s walking out of the event with a WrestleMania title shot, which will in turn reignite his feud with Cody Rhodes. That however, might not be the case at all, and Cena might pick up the win here, securing the WrestleMania main event spot for himself. John Cena wins.Motor City Machine Guns have set an exemplary record in the Stamford-based promotion, ever since they were called up to the main brands from NXT. While they’re yet to pick up their titles from DIY, there’s a chance that they’ll finally do it at Royal Rumble.Although this is a 2 falls out of 3 match, it’s going to be a long drawn match, and will all boil down to the team with the most amount of stamina. They’ve got a lot of steam behind them, and this title victory could do them a world of good.Motor City Machine Guns win.Probably the most important match of the night, Kevin Owens and Cody Rhodes will face off in a Ladder Match for the Undisputed WWE Championship. While Kevin Owens has proved his mettle and could win the title, it’s likely that he won’t walk out with the belt in hand.With John Cena back in the company, there’s a high chance that he’ll want to take a shot at the top wrestler in the company, and with Roman Reigns not holding any title right now, Cody Rhodes is the best bet.Cody Rhodes retains the title.","WWE Royal Rumble is the first major event of 2025 which will kick off the company’s spectacular yearly PLE calendar.

Jalen Hurts leads his team into the Super Bowl LIX! Looks like, history is going to repeat itself! Remember the Super Bowl LVII against the Kansas City Chiefs?

So much speculation revolved around the Washington Commanders and their rookie quarterback, Jayden Daniels, and look what the result turned out to be. The Philadelphia Eagles set a unique record in the playoffs, breaking a 10-year-long mark! All this while quarterback Jalen Hurts of the Eagles kept quiet. He was dealing with his knee injury, but the wounded knight was preparing himself against the Washington Commanders, who were on a deadly streak!Beating the Washington Commanders in the NFL Conference Championship was way too personal for the Philadelphia Eagles. They scored 55-23 against the Washington Commanders on their home ground, Lincoln Financial Field. The Eagles have surpassed the score of Carolina Panthers who scored 49-15 in the 2015 NFL Conference Championship against the Arizona Cardinals.The NFL Insider wrote,“The #Eagles now have scored the most points in a Conference Championship game in NFL history, surpassing the 49 points Carolina scored with Cam Newton in 2015.”, and shared victory pictures of Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton and Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts.By winning against the Washington Commanders, the Philadelphia Eagles also set another record!

Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand believes that Marcus Rashford's future at the club is uncertain following comments made by manager Ruben Amorim .Amorim stated that he would rather have his goalkeeping coach, Jorge Vital, in his matchday squad than Rashford.Rashford has not played for United since December 12, with Amorim leaving him out of the squad for every game since, apart from one in which he was an unused substitute.When asked about Rashford's absence from the squad for Sunday's 1-0 win at Fulham , Amorim made a pointed reference to the player's effort in training.""The reason is the training, what I think a footballer should do in training, in life and every day... I will put (in) Vital before I put (in) a player who doesn't give the maximum every day,"" said Amorim.Ferdinand, who had a successful 12-year career at Old Trafford, said he would be embarrassed by such a statement.""If I was that player that the manager said that about... embarrassment,"" he said on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast.""We all have days off or moments when we're not performing well, lacking confidence, but effort isn't really one of the things I would want to be hearing a manager say is lacking in my makeup.""That's a damning comment, because I think he knows what the reaction is after that comment. He's not saying that without thinking, 'Where does this go after?' There's really no way back for Marcus after that, I don't think, with that type of comment.""Ferdinand believes that there is ""really no way back for Marcus"" after Amorim's comment, despite acknowledging that everyone has off days or moments of lacking confidence.Rashford expressed his desire for a new challenge in December, but he is currently in limbo with one week remaining in the January transfer window.Several European clubs, such as Barcelona, Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan, have shown interest in the 27-year-old, who has scored 138 goals in 426 appearances for United.However, any potential move is complicated by Rashford's reported £300,000-a-week salary on a contract that runs until 2028.","Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim said he would rather have his goalkeeping coach, Jorge Vital, in his matchday squad than Marcus Rashford.

Charlotte Hornets guard LaMelo Ball exited early during the game against the Los Angeles Lakers due to a left ankle injury. The incident occurred in the first half, and Ball did not return to the court for the remainder of the game. The latest left ankle injury added as another setback for the young star, who has dealt with multiple injuries this season. The Hornets have yet to provide an update on the severity of the injury, leaving fans concerned about his availability moving forward as the team navigates a challenging season.

The injury occurred in the second quarter, and the Hornets confirmed he would not return to the game. Before exiting, Ball had recorded seven points, one assist, and one rebound.The Hornets have not provided additional details on the severity of the sprain, leaving his status for future games uncertain. Ball's injury occurred after he made a one-footed 3-pointer. He stepped on Jarred Vanderbilt’s foot, causing him to fall backward and hit his head hard on the floor.After the fall, Ball quickly got up and fouled intentionally to stop the clock. Later, limped toward the locker room on his own. The injury added to the concern surrounding Ball's health, as the Hornets await further updates on his condition.Ball has struggled with ankle injuries since joining the Charlotte Hornets. To protect his ankles, he has been wearing braces this season. Despite these precautions, the latest injury raises further concerns about his long-term health and ability to stay on the court.""I'm going to see over the summer, try some stuff,"" Ball said (per Reed). ""My favorite thing to do is play basketball and to not be able to do it is just horrible... That fact that I got this summer (to be healthy), I'm going to take it and get it as strong I can to get out there and play,"" he added.Two years ago, the 23-year-old's season ended early after a right ankle fracture that required surgery. He struggled again last season, playing only 22 games due to a right ankle issue. Now, his left ankle is the problem, and the timing couldn't be worse.

Career and personal life

Bonnie Blue , a 25-year-old OnlyFans creator from Derbyshire , claims to have set a world record by having sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours, reports Daily Mail.The event took place in London, allegedly surpassing the previous record of 919 men in 24 hours set by adult actress Lisa Sparks in 2004, with Bonnie claiming she ""bedded 1,057 in 12 hours.""In a video shared on TikTok, Bonnie thanked those who participated, saying, “Thank you to all the barely legal, barely breathing and the husbands.”She added that her skin looked better after the event and described the experience: “The room was absolutely full. We did groups of five, like one after the other. It was a rotating circle.”Her PR team confirmed the tally, stating, “She slept with 1,057 people. As she hit 1,000, there were still 57 left in the queue who Bonnie wanted to pleasure before ending the 12-hour day.” Calculations suggest she averaged 41 seconds per partner.The stunt sparked outrage online, with comments such as “How embarrassing” and “Sad that men would want to do that too—all for fame and money.” Bonnie is no stranger to controversy, having previously defended her claims of sleeping with “barely legal” 18-year-olds and encouraging men to cheat on their wives.Bonnie's real name is Tia Billinger , who says she earns up to £750,000 a month from her OnlyFans content. Despite criticism, she insists her work is educational. “I can’t think of one situation where an 18-year-old has had sex where they’ve had to bring a passport, sign consent forms, and do a breathalyser,” she said on ITV’s This Morning.She also addressed criticism for sleeping with married men, arguing, “If wives aren’t going to pleasure husbands, let them go elsewhere. It’s just an act; the husbands mean nothing to me.”Bonnie transitioned to sex work after moving to Australia in 2022 with her now ex-husband, Oliver Davidson. Formerly a recruitment professional, she launched her career as a cam girl and later joined OnlyFans.She claims her family now supports her career, with her mother even assisting her business by booking appointments and handing out condoms for marketing. “It’s changed their life completely for the better,” she said.Bonnie defended her actions, stating, “These 18-year-olds can go to the army, they can drive, they can drink… If they want to use their own bodies to come and sleep with me, that is their decision.”","Bonnie Blue, 25, claims to have had sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours.

Stuart Broad on India's challenge in the Champions Trophy

Cricket fans in South Africa have been flocking to the stadiums on regular basis and being thoroughly entertained with some incredible cricket. At the forefront of it is the spin-bowling approach employed by many teams but none have used it as effectively as the Paarl Royals .In their last home game against Pretoria Capitals at Boland Park, the Royals employed a unique strategy of using a five-man all-spin attack, making it the first time a team has bowled 20 overs of spin in a SA20 match This tactic has proven to be highly successful, with the Royals securing three consecutive victories this past week (five in a row overall), placing them at the top of the SA20 points table and securing their spot in the playoffs. Bjorn Fortuin , the Royals' left-arm spinner who has become their leading wicket-taker, attributes the team's success to the diversity within their spin bowling arsenal.“We're quite diverse as a spin group. We've got myself and (Dunith) Wellalage that both bowl left-arm spin, but different left-arm spin if that makes sense,” said Fortuin.As Bjorn Fortuin, Dunith Wellalage, Mujeeb Ur Rahman , Joe Root and Nqaba Peter shared the bowling responsibilities between them, the batters struggled. Bar Will Jacks (56) and Kyle Verreynne (30), no one reached double digits that day.“Mujeeb (Ur-Rahman) bowls liquorice allsorts, you never know what's going on there. (Joe) Root is just trying to keep things quiet. You've got Nqaba (Peter) that joined us, so we complement each other well, but I think we adapt well as well. Root could do my job in the powerplay, for instance.“Mujeeb could bowl at the death like Root did. So it was quite interchangeable. Anyone could have bowled at any point and fortunately it worked out well for us.”The Royals also boast the league's top run-scorers, with opening duo Joe Root (279 runs at an average of 69.75) and Lhuan-dre Pretorius (258 runs at 36.85) leading the way, while mystery spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman is the joint top wicket-taker with 12 scalps at 15.83.Meanwhile, the Royals' neighbours, MI Cape Town , have also been on an unbeaten streak, making history by securing back-to-back victories - with an abandoned match in between - for the first time in the competition's three-year history, placing them second with 21 points.""There's a different vibe in the camp. (Captain) Rashid (Khan) knows the players well, and you can see the hunger to succeed, especially after the tough past seasons. We owe it to ourselves and the fans,"" said MI Cape Town all-rounder George Linde.Paarl Royals are the only team to have booked their place in the playoffs so far. With six wins in seven, they've collected 24 points, and have looked stellar so far.Right behind are MI Cape Town with four wins in seven and after two consecutive years of bottom place, they are primed to qualify for the next stage in the competition. But will it be in second, third or fourth remains to be seen.A competitive battle is playing out in the middle of the table with defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape (19 points) having won three consecutive matches at home last week before facing a resurgent Joburg Super Kings (15 points) on Sunday.After suffering three defeats on the coast, the Super Kings were delighted to be back on the Highveld and stormed to a nine-wicket bonus point victory over Sunrisers to reignite their push for the playoffs.The clash at the Wanderers also marked Joburg Super Kings captain Faf du Plessis’ 400th T20 appearance.Pretoria Capitals (9 points) and Durban’s Super Giants (8 points) both have one win so far this season and find themselves out of qualification contention.","Paarl Royals are the only team to have booked their place in the playoffs so far.

MI Emirates ' batters Tom Banton and Andre Fletcher took apart the Desert Vipers ' bowling attack to set up a big win for their team, which was completed in an emphatic fashion by their bowlers in the ILT20 match in Abu Dhabi on Monday.A 55-ball 105 by Banton and 96 off 50 balls by opener Fletcher deflated the Vipers' bowling attack, with only Mohammed Amir (1/36) among the seven bowlers used able to take a wicket when he dismissed opener Muhammad Waseem for 19.But after that, Banton and Fletcher added 198 runs for the second wicket in 16.5 overs to take the total to a huge 228 for 2. The demolition job by the two batters saw Banton hitting 9 fours and 7 sixes, while Fletcher smashed 10 fours and 3 sixes.The partnership was broken off the penultimate ball of their innings by way of Banton's run-out.The Vipers' chase never took off as they lost half the side for just 32 runs inside the Powerplay.Captain Sam Curran (11) and wicketkeeper-batter Azam Khan (12) were the only two batters to score in double digits, while pacers Muhammad Rohid (3 for 24) and Alzarri Joseph (3 for 17) ran through the Vipers' batting lineup with three wickets each.Fazalhaq Farooqi and Dan Mousley also bowled commendably, finishing with figures of 2 for 10 and 2 for 8, respectively.","MI Emirates beat Desert Vipers in ILT20 match in Abu Dhabi.

Champions Trophy Squad: Chief selector Ajit Agarkar and skipper Rohit Sharma PC

Rajkot: India's Test & ODI captain Rohit Sharma , star opener Yashasvi Jaiswal and ODI middle-order batter Shreyas Iyer will all not be available for Mumbai's last league match of the season against Meghalaya, which will start from January 30 at the Sharad Pawar Cricket Academy in BKC, TOI has learnt.Allrounder Shivam Dube will also miss that must-win match for the defending Ranji Trophy champions as he has been added to India's squad for the ongoing home T20I series against England.""Rohit, Jaiswal and Iyer are all likely to attend the BCCI's Naman Annual awards in Mumbai on February 1. Next day (February 2), they are supposed to report for a short camp to Nagpur before the three-match ODI series against England,"" a reliable source in the BCCI told this paper.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 The India-England ODI series will begin with the first ODI in Nagpur on February 6.Playing his first Ranji match in a decade, Rohit endured a forgettable outing as he only managed to log scores of six and 28, while Jaiswal made just four and 26 as Mumbai suffered a stunning five-wicket defeat to Jammu & Kashmir at BKC last week.Iyer was out for scores of just 11 and 17, but overall, with 480 runs in five matches at an average of 68.57, and two hundreds, he's been Mumbai's top run-getter in the Ranji Trophy this season. Dube, meanwhile, was out for a 'King Pair' (0 & 0) in the match.Also See: Champions Trophy Fixtures 2025 Mumbai, who have 22 points, still have a faint chance to go through to the knockouts. They need to beat Meghalaya, ideally by a bonus point, and hope that Baroda (27 points) would lose outright to J&K at home or concede the first innings lead if the match ends in a draw.The exit of so many India stars means that in-form talented opener Ayush Mhatre (408 runs in five matches at 45.33 with two centuries), who missed the last match, and allrounder Suryansh Shedge could return to the XI for the key game.On Sunday, Shedge smashed a 71-ball ton, while Mhatre hit 34-ball fifty for the Mumbai U-23 team against Bihar in a Col CK Nayudu Trophy match. Pragnesh Kanpillewar (177 not out, 195b, 16x4, 4x6) too did well in that match.","Rohit Sharma, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shreyas Iyer will miss Mumbai's last league match.

Sachin Tendulkar’s contribution in ISPL is invaluable, says League Commissioner Suraj Samat

NEW DELHI: As Indian cricket holds its breath over Jasprit Bumrah ’s fitness, it has emerged his back injury is due to be assessed by orthopedic surgeon Dr Rowan Schouten in New Zealand, with a consultation visit also planned depending on his report and feedback.TOI understands that the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) is already planning a backup since Bumrah could be cutting it very fine to get fit in time for ICC Champions Trophy next month The ace bowler has been picked for CT and also named in the team for the third ODI against England in Ahmedabad on Feb 12, but there are no high hopes around him.The changes to the CT team can be made till Feb 11. The selectors have already named Harshit Rana for the first two ODIs against England. It will be interesting to see if they continue with Rana should Bumrah fail to get fit for CT.Sources said given the experience he has, Mohammed Siraj could be back in contention in such a scenario.“The BCCI medical team is in touch with Schouten in New Zealand. The board had also planned a visit for Bumrah to New Zealand. But that hasn’t happened yet. The selectors know it will be a miracle if Bumrah turns up 100% fit in the given timeline,” a BCCI source told TOI.Schouten had operated on Bumrah after he missed the T20 World Cup in 2022. He didn’t take the field in the second innings of the Sydney Test in the first week of this month when he complained of discomfort in his back.Bumrah and the rest of the fast bowlers who played most Test matches during the Test season were advised to take a three week offloading process. The offloading process dictates a player to not undertake any strenuous physical activity which includes basic fitness training as well. BCCI’s medical team was due to evaluate Bumrah’s condition after the offloading process which was due to end last week.Also See: Champions Trophy Full Scheudle “The reports will be shared with his doctor in New Zealand. Sending Bumrah to New Zealand will depend on the feedback. The board and Bumrah himself are not willing to push hard given his significance over a long period of time,” the source said.“The selectors will only be informed if he is ready to take the field after the entire process is complete. The selectors will need to keep a backup plan ready for him. It will be a miracle if Bumrah makes it,” the source added.It may be recalled that the Indian team tried to rush Bumrah back in action in a home series against Australia in 2022 which resulted in him breaking down again and he subsequently missed the T20 World Cup. Mohammed Shami’s comeback in international cricket is held back as the team management has not opted to play him in the first two T20Is against England.However, TOI understands that the team management is saving him for the ODI season, and is happy with how Shami is shaping up after a long injury layoff.“Shami has shed two kgs from what he weighed before his injury. He is bowling at full tilt. He is not needed as much in the T20 matches. But he should be good to go once the ODIs come around,” the source added.",Jasprit Bumrah's back injury is due to be assessed by orthopedic surgeon Dr Rowan Schouten in New Zealand.

Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin recently took a jibe at England batter Harry Brook for his unusual excuse of 'smog' affecting their performance in the first T20I in Kolkata.England have struggled in the series so far, being bowled out for 132 in Kolkata and then restricted to 159/9 in the second T20I in Chennai.After the first match, Brook claimed that the smog in Kolkata made it difficult for them to see the ball properly. However, following Brook's second consecutive dismissal to Varun Chakravarthy in Chennai, Ashwin pointed out the clear visibility conditions.On his YouTube channel 'Ash Ki Baat', Ashwin addressed Brook directly: ""There was no smog there in Chennai. Harry Brook had earlier stated that there was smog in Kolkata, so picking Varun Chakravarthy was difficult. I want to say one thing to Harry Brook: 'Please understand that Varun Chakravarthy doesn't bowl leg spin that much. It is [a] googly'.""Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy Ashwin further analysed Brook's dismissals in the series, emphasising that the England batter's inability to read Chakravarthy's deliveries was the main issue, regardless of the lighting conditions.""You moved to the leg stump and couldn't read the delivery, so you got bowled. Then you covered the stump and took a big stride, but couldn't read the googly, you got bowled again. No matter how the light is, if you are not reading the googly out of his hand, you are just not reading the delivery out of his hand,"" said Ashwin.Varun Chakravarthy has been in excellent form since his return to international cricket in October 2024, leading the series with five wickets at an average of 12.20 and an economy of 7.62.

CHENNAI: Tilak Varma may only be at the nascent stage of his T20I career, but the versatile India batter is moulding into a bankable resource.In the tour to South Africa late last year, the left-hander, who was promoted to No. 3, activated his destructive mode, especially during his twin unbeaten centuries. While Tilak has carved a niche for himself with positive intent-filled knocks, the fast-rising 22-year-old on Saturday displayed another key facet of his game.Up against a pace-heavy England attack on a tricky Chepauk track in the second T20I, Tilak showed excellent awareness in the successful 166-run chase and did just what the doctor ordered when the match seemed to be drifting away from the hosts. The southpaw expertly blended caution and aggression besides taking up the lead role in tough circumstances.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy “The pitch was double-paced and it was quite challenging to bat on. Wickets were falling continuously, and I was thinking that I should bat till the end. I wanted to show intent and I was looking for the gaps as well. I did that,” said Tilak after delivering a spectacular unbeaten 72, for which the ‘Man of the Match’ deservedly received a standing ovation.“I know that I can play both types, hitting at a good strike-rate and scoring at six or seven runs per over. During the drinks break, Gautam Gambhir (head coach) told me that I can show everyone that I can play over 10 and under 10 (run-rate). He asked me to be flexible. I got a chance to prove myself in this game,” added Tilak.The youngster operated with a simple yet effective mantra. He met fire with fire, targeting pacer Jofra Archer , whom he smacked for 30 runs off just nine deliveries.“I wanted to take on their (England’s) best bowlers. If I take on the best bowlers, it will put pressure on the others. When wickets were falling, I wanted to take on their best bowler. I felt that it would make the job easier for the batters at the other end. I backed myself and took chances. I was mentally prepared for it, having played those shots at the nets,” he said.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy Fixtures 2025 Brimming with confidence after producing yet another effective knock, Tilak is prepared to perform a different role if required. “Before the South Africa series, I had not batted much at No. 3, maybe two or three times. I am ready to bat anywhere, and I am flexible. I know how to manage while batting at Nos 4, 5 or 6, but I like batting at No. 3. What the team needs, I am ready for that,” Tilak went on to add.",Tilak Varma was named Man of the Match in the second T20I against England.

The Uzbek player later issued an apology, clarifying that his action was due to ""religious reasons"" and was not meant to disrespect her.In a video shared by ChessBase India on social media, Vaishali is seen extending her hand before their fourth-round match, but Yakubboev sits down without reciprocating, leaving the Indian visibly uncomfortable.Yakubboev, 23, who became a GM in 2019, lost the match and currently has three points after eight rounds in the Challengers' section.After the video went viral, Yakubboev posted a detailed response on 'X,' stating, ""I want to explain the situation that happened in the game with Vaishali. With all due respect to women and Indian chess players, I want to inform everyone that I do not touch other women for religious reasons.""""I respect Vaishali and her brother as the strongest chess players in India. If I have offended her with my behavior, I apologise,"" he added. ""I do what I need to do. I do not insist others not to shake hands with the opposite gender or for women to wear hijab or burqa. It is their business what to do.""Yakubboev, a practicing Muslim, noted that he did not have an opportunity to inform Vaishali about his beliefs before their game.Vaishali did not extend her hand again after defeating Yakubboev. She currently has four points after eight rounds, with five more to play.To prevent further misunderstandings, Yakubboev said he informed Romania's Irina Bulmaga about his beliefs ahead of their eighth-round match. ""Today (Sunday), I told Irina Bulmaga about it. She agreed to it. But when I came to the playing hall, the arbiters told me that I should at least do Namaste as a gesture. In the games with Divya and Vaishali, I couldn't tell them about it before the game, and there was an awkward situation,"" he explained.Another Uzbek player, Nodirbek Abdusattorov, is competing in the 'Open' section of the tournament.","Grandmaster Nodirbek Yakubboev's decision not to shake hands with Indian GM R Vaishali sparked controversy at the Tata Steel Chess Tournament.

NEW DELHI: The second day of the Indian Street Premier League ( ISPL ) Season 2 delivered electrifying action with Falcon Risers Hyderabad and Srinagar Ke Veer kicking off their campaigns in spectacular fashion after a mesmerising performance by playback singer Sonu Nigam at the Dadoji Kondadev Stadium in Thane.In the first match, Falcon Risers Hyderabad secured a comfortable eight-wicket victory against Chennai Singams.The Falcons chased down the target of 69 runs with ease, losing just two wickets and finishing the game with three overs to spare.Chennai Singams, opting to bat first after winning the toss, had a shaky start as opener Ketan Mhatre was dismissed in the first over. Jagannath Sarkar, the other opener, showcased his power-hitting skills, smashing 22 runs off just 8 deliveries before being run out due to a miscommunication with Prashant Gharat.Sarkar's brief but impactful innings proved to be the only dominant period for the Singams, as the rest of their batters struggled against the Falcons' bowling attack.

Adding to their woes, they failed to score the minimum requirement of 10 runs during the 50-50 over, resulting in a deduction of three runs from their total.The Falcons' chase began steadily, with openers Padmesh Mhatre and Kisan Satpute keeping the scoreboard ticking.Although Chennai briefly fought back, dismissing Satpute and Shreyash Kadam in quick succession, Hyderabad regained control as skipper Sambhaji Patil joined Mhatre to seal the victory in style.Srinagar Ke Veer too kicked off their campaign with a resounding 10-wicket win over KVN Bangalore Strikers.The Strikers were held to their lowest ISPL score of 61/6.In response, Sagar Ali and Mangesh Vaity chased down the target in just 5.3 overs.Sagar became the first batter this season to score a half-century, reaching the milestone in only 23 deliveries.

ILT20: Rovman Powell lauds Farhan Khan for stopping Kieron Pollard

NEW DELHI: Desert Vipers celebrated a commanding eight-wicket victory over the Sharjah Warriorz at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Saturday, bolstered by standout performances from both seasoned internationals and emerging local talent.Among the heroes was UAE debutant Khuzaima Tanveer , whose remarkable spell of 4/22 earned him accolades and put him in the spotlight.Reflecting on the young pacer’s stunning debut, Vipers star Sam Curran was full of praise: “Special day when you see a local UAE debutant coming and get 4 for 20 on debut. I think (it is) a perfect dream start (for him). And what an exciting, exciting future he's got. He's obviously very young, has got really good pace and such skill. So it was great to see. The whole point of this competition is to keep expanding the UAE players and giving them that exposure.”The Vipers’ triumph began with their bowlers delivering a disciplined performance. David Payne set the tone early, removing Johnson Charles and Avishka Fernando inside the powerplay.Tanveer then capitalised on the momentum, dismantling the middle and lower order with surgical precision, claiming the scalps of Tim Seifert, Rohan Mustafa, Luke Wood, and Tim Southee.His exceptional performance not only contained the Warriorz to 151/8 but also earned him admiration from teammates and fans alike.In reply, the Vipers' chase was a spectacle.

Brydon Carse makes his case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/england-tour-of-india-2025/brydon-carse-makes-his-case/articleshow/117607934.cms,"Brydon Carse

CHENNAI: Once England all-rounder Brydon Carse was brought in as replacement for Gus Atkinson in the second T20I against India , he wasted no time making his mark. On Saturday, Carse first helped turn the tide with a cameo and later delivered the breakthroughs that gave England a glimmer of hope.Carse’s performance was as much about seizing the moment as it was about making a case for his place in England’s crowded fast-bowling lineup.“I think the current English stock of fast bowlers is pretty high, the competition for places is good. So, every time you put on an England shirt, you try and put in a good performance. You know that there are guys waiting in the wings,” said Carse, whose cricketing journey has been punctuated by a knee injury and a 16-month suspension for betting on matches.First, Carse with the bat. Walking in at No 8 with England struggling against spin, the 29-year-old launched a quick-fire 31 from just 17 balls (1x4, 3x6) to pad up the total. He even took on mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy, striking back-to-back sixes, including an audacious one-handed hit over deep backward square-leg. While his stay ended with a run-out, his cameo lifted England’s total beyond what seemed possible before his arrival.“I felt in good rhythm, and I was always going to be trying to be positive towards the spinners and pick my strong areas. On Saturday, that paid off. It is always frustrating to get run out, but those things happen, a little bit of miscommunication from both of us but I spoke to Jof (Jofra Archer). He is fine and the game goes on,” said Carse.It was with the ball that Carse truly stood out. On a fresh surface offering good bounce, the right-arm quick hit the hard lengths that sent back three key India batters – skipper Suryakumar Yadav , Dhruv Jurel and Washington Sundar.“I think we are always going to take that aggressive approach like how we bowled today … we are always trying to get wickets and setting fields to try and continually pick up wickets. On another day, a chance here or there and we (may) come out winners,” he declared.",Brydon Carse made 31 from just 17 balls in second T20I against India.

‘Surya playing for team, is a selfless cricketer’

Stuart Broad on India's challenge in the Champions Trophy

RAJKOT: A critical part of India's new batting coach Sitanshu Kotak ’s role will, of course, start after the ongoing India versus England T20I series. Somehow, he has to help the two stalwarts of Indian batting — skipper Rohit Sharma and star batter Virat Kohli , who have been going through a bad patch — rediscover their touch.Ahead of the third T20I at the Niranjan Shah Stadium, asked if he had identified where he would help them rectify any minor weaknesses that may have crept into their game, Kotak said, “See, Rohit and Virat are very senior players, but even the players we have now, it is a lot more about sharing, a lot to try and understand how they are planning their games, where they think and then if we can add something, that is how I think.”A regular head coach with India for the last three years and a domestic cricket warhorse for Saurashtra, Kotak didn’t shy away from saying that even he could learn a few things from Rohit and Virat, two modern-day greats of the game.“If I can add value to 2%, 5%, that is a great thing, because the amount of cricket they have played and the way they have performed, it would not be unfair to say there might be a lot of things that I can also learn from them. That is the way this game goes, you have to be open and you have to be ready to learn,” he said.He made it clear that if he had any suggestions about their batting in his mind, he would speak to them at the opportune time. “If they are in a mindset, during that point of time, if they are ready to take any inputs, yes, I would have certain things in my mind and I will say it, but it has to be at the right time and they should feel that yes, they are ready for that,” the 52-year-old former left-hander said.Meanwhile, Kotak attributed Suryakumar Yadav 's dry run in the last few months to huge expectations. Considering that Suryakumar was playing “selfless and fearless cricket” for the benefit of the Indian team, there would be times when he and the other Indian batters would get out while trying to play a risky shot.“Sometimes, I feel (that) we also expect a lot. The game has become so aggressive and that is the intent (with which) we have to play T20. There will be a time when the batters will get out because they are playing fearless and selfless (cricket), because if you want to score 200, 225 and if you are careful and trying to save your wicket, both the things won't go hand in hand. So, he is definitely a person who is playing for the team. He is very, very selfless and that is what he is telling the whole group of batters that we have to be selfless,” Kotak explained.“The way he is batting, he is in the same flow as he was before, I think. Nothing (wrong with his batting) really I would say that. But yes, plan-wise, the opposition will try and plan to bowl in some areas and obviously we read that, and he is very smart. So, he comes up with things which he knows we can add something and according to that, he keeps practicing. I don't really think that his form or runs have been dry or anything,” Kotak added.India’s batting coach concluded by saying that he was hoping for Surya to bounce back into form on Tuesday night. “I think, touch wood, this game!”",Sitanshu Kotak is India's new batting coach. The 52-year-old has been with the national team for the last three years. Kotak says he can learn a lot from the likes of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.
