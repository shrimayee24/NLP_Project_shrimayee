India Playing XI for Adelaide Test: Big selection headaches for India

Australia suffered a huge blow when Josh Hazlewood was ruled out of the pink-ball Test against India in Adelaide , which put the focus on right-arm pacer Scott Boland to replace him for the second Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy . But India got a good look at Boland with the pink ball in the warm-up fixture at Canberra, which many in Australia believe has put India at an advantage.Boland was named in the Australian Prime Minister's XI squad well before Hazlewood's side strain made him unavailable for the day-night Test in Adelaide. But cricket experts and the Aussie media believe that Cricket Australia could have withdrawn him and not let India warm-up against the 35-year-old seamer.Australian journalist Tom Morris questioned if the CA selectors have done the ""right thing"".Speaking on SEN radio, Morris said: ""Did the Australian selectors do the right thing playing Scott Boland against India? Would it have been better for him and Australia to go into this game with India not having seen him with a pink ball?""Boland has played 10 Tests in his career so far since his debut in the Boxing Day Test of the 2021 Ashes series. But he has been out of the side since the Leeds Test of the Ashes in July last year.""I probably expected to play at some stage last summer with seven Tests because of the New Zealand tour as well,"" Boland was quoted as saying by yahoo.com. ""Obviously with those guys (Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc) being so resilient, they don't miss too many and no one wants to give up their spot at any stage.""They were so dominant last summer, they weren't bowling a heap of overs. We were able to win most of those games, so I probably thought maybe the opportunity had passed. I've worked really hard during the off-season to get my body in a spot where I'm confident that if I get another chance I'll be able to perform for Australia again.""Cricket Australia has added fast bowlers Sean Abbott and Brendan Doggett in the squad, but Boland remains the front-runner to replace Hazlewood.",Australia suffered a huge blow when Josh Hazlewood was ruled out of the pink- ball Test against India in Adelaide. Right-arm pacer Scott Boland will replace him for the second Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy. Cricket experts and the Aussie media believe that Cricket Australia could have withdrawn him and not let India warm-up against the 35-year-old seamer.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115915495,imgsize-83266,width-400,resizemode-4/115915495.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The two-day Indian Premier League (IPL) auction concluded in the port city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia on November 25, with Rishabh Pant emerging as the costliest buy, breaking the record of biggest price tag with a pay-cheque of a staggering Rs 27 crore from the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).Batter Shreyas Iyer came a close second with a bid of Rs 26.75 crore, shelled out by the Punjab Kings.Rishabh Pant, who was not retained by Delhi Capitals (DC) and is currently playing the Test series in Australia, was bought by the LSG after an intense bidding war with Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Delhi -- taking his base-price of Rs 2 crore to a record rise. It will be the first time that Pant will move out of his hometown Delhi to play for another IPL side, and it required LSG to empty their pockets, breaking the record set by Australian pacer Mitchell Starc last year with his Rs 24.75 crore bid from Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). In all likelihood, Pant will lead the LSG side, especially because KL Rahul is no longer with the Lucknow team.Shreyas Iyer took home a whopping Rs 26.75 crore pay-cheque from Punjab. Released by KKR ahead of the auction, Iyer had led the franchise to their third IPL title in 2024, after missing the entire 2023 season due to a back injury. However, he was still not retained by Kolkata. The 29-year-old was originally bought by KKR for Rs 12.25 crore in 2022, taking on the role of captain following seven seasons with Delhi Capitals. Punjab, who were also looking for a marquee player to lead the side, might appoint him as their skipper for the 2025 season.Venkatesh Iyer turned out to be a surprise star at the IPL 2025 mega auction, with reigning champions KKR splashing a massive Rs 23.75 crore to bring him back into the fold. The left-handed Iyer was not retained by KKR ahead of the auction. Iyer entered the auction with a base price of Rs 2 crore, with KKR making the first move for the star performer of their title-winning run in the last edition and eventually winning the bid after an intense battle with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB).England white-ball captain Jos Buttler laughed his way to the bank as he raked in a jaw-dropping Rs 15.75 crore from 2022 champions Gujarat Titans (GT). After an intense three-way bidding war, GT secured the services of the England superstar for a whopping price. Buttler, who was not retained by Rajasthan Royals ahead of the auction, was part of the franchise for the last seven editions. Before joining Royals in 2018, Buttler had represented Mumbai Indians in 2016 and 2017 editions. Buttler also brings with him valuable experience and leadership qualities.KL Rahul was part of the marquee list at the auction and had a base price of Rs. 2 crore. He had entered the IPL auction after not being retained by LSG despite being their captain last season. Rahul has been a vital asset for multiple franchises over the years, including the Lucknow, Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings), Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Sunrisers Hyderabad. With Pant no longer with DC, Rahul is the most likely candidate to lead the Delhi team in the 2025 season.Rajasthan Royals (RR) snapped up England pacer Jofra Archer for Rs 12.50 crore. The Royals, known for their strategic picks, brought back Archer, adding a world-class bowler to their roster. Archer, who played his last IPL season in 2020, was added back to the shortlist three days before the auction. The right-arm pacer made his comeback this summer after a lengthy injury layoff, featuring in England's white-ball series against Pakistan, Australia and the West Indies, as well as the T20 World Cup.MI bagged veteran New Zealand pacer Trent Boult, known for his early strikes with the new ball, for Rs 12.50 crore. The move will reunite the Kiwi left-arm pacer, who took 16 wickets in last IPL season but was still released by Rajasthan, will reunite with India’s ace fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah at MI. The pair was instrumental in Mumbai's title-winning campaign in 2020. It was their fifth and last crown. Overall, Boult has represented as many as five teams: Sunrisers Hyderabad, Kolkata Knight Riders, Delhi Capitals, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals in the cash-rich league.Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) has successfully re-acquired the Australian right-arm pacer Josh Hazlewood for Rs 12.5 crore. Having previously contributed to RCB's impressive 2021 season, Hazlewood is set to lead their pace attack once again. His proven skills in generating bounce and movement will significantly enhance RCB's fast-bowling department.Ishan Kishan will be turning up for a new franchise in the IPL as the youngster was sold to SRH for Rs 11.25 crore, which is 26% less than Rs 15.25 crore MI paid to buy him in the 2022 auction. Mumbai started the bidding for Kishan at his pace price of Rs 2 crore but didn't go beyond Rs 3.20 crore. Delhi Capitals, looking for a wicketkeeper-batter after Rishabh Pant wasn't retained, were in an intense bidding war with Punjab Kings before SRH joined the action late and got his services.Chennai Super Kings secured Afghanistan's young talent Noor Ahmad for Rs 10 crore after a fierce bidding contest ensued between Mumbai Indians and Chennai for the left-arm Afghanistan spinner's services. Initially acquired by CSK for Rs 5 crore, Ahmad's price doubled when GT's attempt to get him with the 'Right to Match' card was thwarted by CSK's elevated bid of Rs 10 crore. Chennai's acquisition of Ravichandran Ashwin, the retention of Ravindra Jadeja from IPL 2024 and the addition of Ahmad has established a formidable spin-bowling unit that appears well-suited to their home-ground conditions.","Indian Premier League (IPL) auction concluded in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia on November 25.

NFL fans attribute the struggles of Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker to a moment with Kansas City Chiefs Travis Kelce last season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-fans-attribute-the-struggles-of-baltimore-ravens-kicker-justin-tucker-to-a-moment-with-kansas-city-chiefs-travis-kelce-last-season/articleshow/115916935.cms,"Image via Getty Images

NFL fans claim that Justin Tucker has experienced a significant change since the Travis Kelce moment

Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker has surpassed Justin Tucker and Eddy Piñeiro in career field-goal percentage, according to Pro Football Reference, a record set during his three-week injury absence, with a career percentage of 89.21%. Piñeiro and Tucker missed field-goal attempts in Sunday's loss to the Buccaneers and Ravens' 24-19 loss to Eagles, respectively.Tucker has missed eight field-goal attempts this season, a career high. Among possible reasons is a kerfuffle between him and the Chiefs before the AFC Championship Game in Baltimore. Former Chiefs wide receiver Gehrig Dieter has been on social media a couple of times writing about how tight end Travis Kelce ""broke"" Tucker from that stormy exchange.The Ravens are facing their toughest season for kicker Justin Tucker ever, with an unprecedented eight misses for the season- including an extra point and two field goals in Week 13 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. ""The Ravens are going along at 8-5, and this time they might be doing it off an unusual struggle from Justin Tucker"".Last season, it was during the pregame warmups in Kansas City's designated area during the AFC Championship Game that Tucker's struggles began. When neither of the players gave up space, Kelce allegedly threw Tucker's equipment aside to make way for Patrick Mahomes. In the game, Tucker did not do badly, making a field goal attempt and extra point, but fans believe this incident had a lasting effect.""The Chiefs devil magic is real because Justin Tucker hasn't been the same since [the Kelce incident],"" one fan commented online. Another joked, ""My man needed to get baptized after that moment.”Sunday's game against the Eagles marked a new low for Tucker, whose first miss in the opening quarter turned a potential 10-0 lead into a 9-0 scoreline. In the third quarter, Tucker missed two more attempts-a 47-yarder and a 53-yarder, both at critical moments as the Ravens tried to rally. After the game, Ravens head coach John Harbaugh defended his star kicker. ""Justin is definitely capable of making every kick... Nobody wants to make those kicks more than Justin,"" he noted. ""If you're asking me are we going to move on from Justin Tucker, I'm not really planning on doing that right now.”Also Read: Are the Kansas City Chiefs favoured by the referees? Fans and critics have highlighted instances where referees favored the team The Ravens will have a bye week next week, so they can give Justin Tucker rest and get him back focused. Head coach Jeff Harbaugh said the team will take most of the week off, and he does not plan to move on from Justin Tucker at this time. They will play the 2-10 New York Giants in Week 15. The Ravens stand at 8-5 and are 1.5 games behind the Pittsburgh Steelers, who are currently atop the AFC North.","Tucker has missed eight field-goal attempts this season, a career high.

Jamal Adams’ grateful return to the NFL stage



Detroit Lions News: Lions Sign Jamal Adams, Jonah Williams, and Kwon Alexander + Vikings Win

After parting ways with the Titans in October, safety Jamal Adams was given a fresh start, signing with the Detroit Lions ’ practice squad. With injuries piling up on their defense, the Lions saw the potential for Adams to add much-needed depth. Though Adams didn’t anticipate joining a Super Bowl contender like Detroit, he’s thankful for the opportunity.“It’s been a crazy ride, but I’m just grateful to be on a team that’s on fire right now,” Adams said, reflecting on the Lions’ dominant season. “So I’m fortunate enough to, again, just to be on a team that’s rolling like that. And whatever I can do to help, that’s what I’m here for.”Adams couldn’t hide his appreciation for the chance to join such a well-run organization. “It’s a dream come true,” Adams continued. “They didn’t have to call me. They didn’t need me — they’ve been doing phenomenal. So just to get that call from a first-class organization like the Detroit Lions, it’s a no-brainer for me. I’m just grateful for my opportunity, and wherever they want me out there, whenever they call my name and call my number, I’m there.” (Via: NBC Sports)Before his release, Adams played in just three games with Tennessee this season. A versatile safety who has frequently lined up closer to the line of scrimmage, Adams brings a unique skill set that could be crucial for Detroit’s banged-up front seven.“I just feel like I can do a little bit of everything,” Adams said. “Whatever they ask me to do, I’m definitely going to do it to the best of my ability and just fly around and continue to make plays.”At 29, Jamal Adams has faced his fair share of setbacks, having played in just 13 games since 2022 due to injuries. Despite his limited appearances, Adams showcased his potential last season with Seattle, registering 48 tackles, seven tackles for loss, two QB hits, and two passes defensed in just nine games. Those performances served as a reminder of his versatility and playmaking ability. Now, with a fresh start in Detroit, Adams hopes to bring that same level of impact to a team on the rise. As the Lions gear up for their playoff push, Adams is eager to prove he can still be a difference-maker and help propel them to greater success.Also Read: Finalists for the Hall of Fame 2025: Mike Holmgren, Sterling Sharpe, Maxie Baughan, Jim Tyrer, and Ralph Hay",Jamal Adams was released by the Tennessee Titans in October.

What India need to do to qualify for World Test Championship final

Should India continue with KL Rahul-Yashasvi Jaiswal as openers?

NEW DELHI: Two iconic cricketers from Mumbai Sachin Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli reunited at the unveiling of a memorial for their childhood coach, Ramakant Achrekar , at the historic Shivaji Park on Tuesday.The visuals of their meeting quickly went viral on social media, capturing the attention of cricket enthusiasts worldwide.While the audio of their conversation was unclear, the meeting appeared to end on an awkward note, with Kambli seemingly wanting to sit with Tendulkar before being asked to leave.This incident raised concerns among fans about Kambli's well-being.Watch:The reunion brought back memories of their legendary partnership in a Harris Shield match, where they scored a staggering 664 runs together for their school, Shardashram Vidyamandir, against St Xavier's.Kambli scored 349 runs, while Tendulkar amassed 326 runs, both remaining not out, cementing their status as prodigies at a young age.Tendulkar's illustrious international career spanned over two decades, during which he played 200 Tests and 463 ODIs for India.He holds the record for the most runs scored in both formats and is the only player in cricket history to score 100 international centuries, solidifying his reputation as one of the greatest players of all time.Kambli, on the other hand, had a relatively shorter international career, playing 17 Tests and 104 ODIs for India.He scored 1084 runs in Tests, including four centuries (two of which were double centuries), at an impressive average of 54.20. In ODIs, he amassed 2477 runs at an average of 32.29, with two centuries to his name.","Sachin Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli reunited at unveiling of a memorial for their childhood coach, Ramakant Achrekar.

Sunil Gavaskar vs Sachin Tendulkar vs Virat Kohli: And the verdict is...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/sunil-gavaskar-vs-sachin-tendulkar-vs-virat-kohli-and-the-verdict-is-/articleshow/115955415.cms,"Virat Kohli back among the runs with a solid hundred vs Australia in Perth

NEW DELHI: Comparing Sunil Gavaskar Sachin Tendulkar , and Virat Kohli is like comparing legends from three distinct eras of cricket. Each has left an indelible mark on the game in their unique way.Sunil Gavaskar played at a time when the format of Test cricket was predominant and ODIs were limited. Gavaskar's mastery against fast bowling in an era without helmets, exceptional technique, and consistency is stuff of legends.Gavaskar was the first player to score 10,000 runs in Test cricket and he retired with 34 Test centuries to his name, a world record at that time.Gavaskar played a pivotal role in earning respect for Indian cricket in the 1970s and '80s and was the bedrock of India's batting during a time when pitches were bowler-friendly, and helmets were unheard of. His performances against the fearsome West Indies pace attack were iconic.Sachin Tendulkar excelled in both Tests and ODIs; saw the advent of T20 cricket. Tendulkar's versatility, adaptability, and unmatched ability to dominate bowlers across conditions and formats made him one of the greatest batsmen to play the game.Tendulkar retired with most runs in both Tests and ODIs and became the first cricketer to get to 100 international hundreds and was also a key player in India's 2011 World Cup victory.Tendulkar became the face of Indian cricket during the 1990s and early 2000s, inspiring an entire generation. He was revered for his consistency and longevity in a highly demanding cricketing landscape.Virat Kohli has excelled in all three formats: Tests, ODIs, and T20Is. Known as the chase master, Kohli's aggressive mindset, and ability to adapt to the modern demands of fitness and power cricket make him a modern-day great.With over 25,000 international runs across formats, most centuries in ODI chases, Kohli revitalized India's Test cricket ethos with aggressive leadership and redefined modern cricket standards with his fitness and intensity.Under Kohli's captaincy, India became a dominant Test side. His dominance in limited-overs formats, particularly in chasing, is unparalleled.And now a video is viral on which Gavaskar is asked during a talk show who was better Sachin Tendulkar , Virat Kohli or him (Gavaskar).Gavaskar replies after pausing for a moment, ""I think everybody was very good, but I think Gary Sobers was the best.""With a puzzled look and a smile, the co-host who had asked the question says, ""Yeah I'm glad, but I didn't give him that as an option.""Gavaskar adds, ""Yeah, I know that, that's where the dry comes in.""Another co-host chips in light-heartedly, ""Don't get frustrated with the guest on Drip Tray. He gave you his answer and that's his answer.""The first co-host adds, ""Well, I'm not coming to dinner now."" And his reply even invokes a beaming smile from Gavaskar.For the record, Sir Garfield Sobers is often regarded as the greatest all-rounder in cricket history, who transcended his era with his incredible versatility and match-winning ability.Sobers scored 26 Test centuries, including a then-world record unbeaten 365 against Pakistan in 1958, which remained unbeaten for 36 years.Sobers was the ultimate all-rounder, equally adept at winning matches with bat, ball, or in the field and in 1968, became the first cricketer to hit six sixes in an over in a first-class match, playing for Nottinghamshire.Sobers was one of the first truly global cricketing superstars, admired for his sportsmanship and grace on and off the field.","Sunil Gavaskar was the first player to score 10,000 runs in Test cricket.

Rishabh Pant created history at the IPL 2025 Auction, becoming the most expensive player in the league's history. The dynamic left-handed wicketkeeper-batter was snapped up by Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) for a record-breaking Rs 27 crore. Pant's credentials as a proven match-winner and natural leader made him LSG's obvious choice to spearhead their campaign.For a brief moment, Shreyas Iyer held the title of the most expensive IPL player after Punjab Kings secured his services for Rs 26.75 crore. Iyer, who led Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to the championship last season, was a hot commodity at the auction following his release by KKR.While Pant and Iyer were expected to fetch eye-watering bids, the third-highest bid of the IPL 2025 Auction was a surprise. KKR made headlines by bringing back Venkatesh Iyer for Rs 23.75 crore, highlighting their commitment to retaining their core players.Another standout moment of the two-day auction was the signing of 13-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi. Starting with a base price of Rs 30 lakh, the teenager became a sensation when Rajasthan Royals secured him for Rs 1.10 crore, making him one of the youngest players to ever feature in the IPL.Out of the national team setup for over two years, Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s experience found high demand among IPL franchises, with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) securing his services for Rs 10.75 crore on Monday.The second day of the mega auction turned out to be lucrative for several Indian pacers, while some big names, including Shardul Thakur, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, Kane Williamson, and Glenn Phillips, went unsold.Set to turn 35 before the start of the next IPL season, Bhuvneshwar boasts an impressive record of 300 wickets in 287 T20 matches with an economy rate under eight.Other notable deals included Deepak Chahar, who fetched Rs 9.25 crore from Mumbai Indians despite his injury history, and Mukesh Kumar, retained by Delhi Capitals for Rs 8 crore through the RTM card. Lucknow Super Giants also invested heavily, signing Test pacer Akash Deep for Rs 8 crore.Among the all-rounders, Krunal Pandya earned Rs 5.75 crore from RCB, who were in need of an experienced spin-bowling all-rounder. Rajasthan Royals made significant bids for Tushar Deshpande (Rs 6.50 crore) and Nitish Rana (Rs 4.20 crore), while Delhi Capitals secured former RCB skipper Faf du Plessis at a bargain base price of Rs 2 crore. Gujarat Titans acquired Washington Sundar for Rs 3.20 crore in another smart move.The scarcity of quality Indian seam-bowling all-rounders worked in favor of South Africa’s Marco Jansen, who secured a Rs 7 crore deal with Punjab Kings. Also making a major gain was veteran New Zealand pacer Trent Boult who was bought by Mumbai Indians for Rs 12.5 crore -- highlighting the demand for quality fast bowlers.Meanwhile, the auction reflected the high demand for Indian talent despite the limited options, ensuring lucrative deals for even fringe players.On Sunday, the first day of the auction, most of the high-profile names raked in the moolah as the franchises virtually emptied their pockets to bag the priority players in their respective shortlist.Led by Rs 27 crore Lucknow Super Giants spent to buy star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, the sum of money splurged by the franchises came to a whopping INR 467.95 crore.Pant edged past Shreyas Iyer, who fetched Rs 26.75 crore from Punjab Kings, as teams went all out for marquee Indian stars. Venkatesh Iyer took home a whopping Rs 23.75 crore from KKR.A total of 84 players from the roster of 577 were presented on the opening day at the Abadi Al Johar Arena. Out of these 68 got sold, while four were retained through the Right-to-Match card.Among other big buys, leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal attracted Rs 18 crore from Punjab Kings, who also used the Right-to-Match card to bring back paceman Arshdeep Singh for Rs 18 crore. KL Rahul was picked up by Delhi Capitals for Rs 14 crore.Meanwhile, the BCCI has taken a significant step by announcing the schedules for the IPL for the next three seasons. This is a departure from the usual practice of releasing schedules closer to the tournament.The 2025 IPL will commence on March 14 and conclude on May 25.The IPL Auction 2025 showcased a dramatic and competitive bidding war, with several franchises securing high-profile talent to strengthen their squads for the upcoming season. The second day saw Indian pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar topping the chart with a hefty price of INR 10.75 crore, reflecting the high demand for experienced fast bowlers despite his long absence from the national team. This influx of Indian talent demonstrates how IPL franchises value local players, often resulting in hefty bids even for those not part of the national setup.Franchises made smart moves by picking up key players based on specific team needs. Deepak Chahar, for example, fetched Rs 9.25 crore despite a history of injuries, highlighting the increasing reliance on proven seamers. Meanwhile, Mumbai Indians, who often make shrewd investments, secured both Mukesh Chahar and Deepak Chahar, bolstering their pace attack for IPL 2025. Lucknow Super Giants also impressed with strategic buys like Akash Deep, further reinforcing their depth in bowling.Notably, there was also a surge in the prices of all-rounders like Krunal Pandya (Rs 5.75 crore) and Washington Sundar (Rs 3.20 crore), whose versatility adds immense value to their respective teams. This indicates that franchises are looking for players who can contribute with both bat and ball, especially in the high-pressure, multifaceted environment of the IPL.The auction was also marked by some surprising omissions. Players like Shardul Thakur, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, and Kane Williamson, who are usually regarded as top performers, went unsold, pointing to the shifting dynamics of IPL team strategies. While these players' exclusion may have shocked fans, it underlined the intense competition for spots and the changing nature of what franchises are looking for in their squads.Overall, the 2025 auction was a testament to the evolving nature of IPL strategies—teams focused on a mix of experience, youth, and flexibility. As the season nears, fans can look forward to an exciting and unpredictable tournament, with new combinations and fresh talent ready to light up the IPL stage.","Bhuvneshwar Kumar, out of India's national team for two years, fetched a hefty Rs 10.75 crore from RCB in the IPL 2025 auction. Deepak Chahar and Mukesh Kumar also secured lucrative deals. Rishabh Pant became the most expensive player on Day 1, going to LSG for Rs 27 crore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115654073,imgsize-87934,width-400,resizemode-4/115654073.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) are gearing up for the 18th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) with a revamped squad, assembled during the auction held at the Abadi Al Johar Arena in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.Still in search of their elusive maiden IPL title, RCB will aim to break their championship drought in 2025, building on years of near misses and promising campaigns.Ahead of the auction, the franchise retained three key players: Virat Kohli (Rs 21 crore), Rajat Patidar (Rs 11 crore), and Yash Dayal (Rs 5 crore). This left them with Rs 83 crore—the second-largest purse among the 10 franchises—to strengthen their squad.RCB made some impactful additions during the auction, notably acquiring all-rounder Liam Livingstone for Rs 8.75 crore and wicketkeeper-batter Phil Salt for Rs 11.50 crore, significantly boosting their batting lineup. Indian wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma was another high-profile signing at Rs 11 crore.In the bowling department, RCB brought back Australian pacer Josh Hazlewood for Rs 12.5 crore, ensuring experienced leadership for the pace attack alongside Bhuvneshwar Kumar. To complement their spin options, they added Indian spinner Suyash Sharma for Rs 2.60 crore, rounding out a well-balanced squad with both firepower and depth.""It was really great to get Bhuvi today, that level of skill, along with Krunal's level of skill, will complement Hazlewood coming back to RCB. It'd be great to have him back at back at the club. Yash Dayal, we saw what he did last year and we've got a Rasikh, vying for a place as well.

The NFL announced that Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair has been suspended for three games

The NFL has suspended Houston Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair for three games for repeated infractions of player safety rules after a hit on Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence. The NFL has suspended Al-Shaair for violating rules governing player safety, stating that the league deemed the incident unacceptable and would not tolerate his continued disregard for these rules.Al-Shaair was thrown out of the second quarter of Houston's win Sunday over Jacksonville after his vicious hit on the face mask of Lawrence as the quarterback slid to the ground, leaving Jaguars star Trevor Lawrence with a concussion.The NFL announced that Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair has been suspended for three games for a hit that concussed Trevor Lawrence in a 23-20 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. This altercation sparked a melee that resulted in two players being ejected from the field, one of whom is Al-Shaair.NFL vice president Jon Runyan has announced a suspension for quarterback Al-Shaair for delivering a contact to the head/neck area that he sidestepped. Jon Runyan described Al-Shaair's actions after the contact including participating in a fight, dragging down a man by his facemask, and then continuing to fight with Jags men in the end zone once he was tossed.""You were involved in a play that the [NFL] considers unacceptable and a serious violation of the playing rules,"" Runyan wrote Tuesday. ""Video shows you striking the head/neck area of Jaguars' quarterback Trevor Lawrence after he clearly goes down in a feet-first slide. ...

How India are preparing for the Pink-Ball Test vs Australia in Adelaide

ADELAIDE: The delayed red-eye flight to Adelaide seemed in limbo on its Singapore tarmac. The snaking queues had long passed their state of agitation and quieted down to uneasy repose when the momentary sighting of Gautam Gambhir made heads turn.India's coach was heading back to the scene of the action in Australia after a brief visit back home. Glances met, pleasantries exchanged and brief handshakes later, he retreated into his own world, down the vast corridors of one of the world's busiest airports, but not before sending everyone's cricketing pulse racing.A few hours later and into the next day, in another continent, Gambhir stood quietly, first in the background and then in the second pacers' nets, as India's batters hit the ground running ahead of the crucial second Test against Australia.Only, this wasn't an ordinary nets session. Heaving hordes tumbled in to catch a glimpse of their stars in action at a rare arm's length. Adelaide, the city of vibrant colours, seemed tickled pink by the presence of India's star cricketers.It was a goodwill gesture, an open nets session to stimulate interest, but the practice session turned into concert-level frenzy. Security had to be called in at times to clear restricted areas. A thousand selfies were clicked. Excited teenagers called up friends asking them to rush over. Beating drums rent the air, and, of course, Virat Kohli soaked in all the hero worship.""Sab mazey le rahey hai (Everyone's having fun),"" Rishabh Pant told Rohit Sharma in the adjacent nets at one point after having a rather hard time coping with Jasprit Bumrah , Akash Deep, Mohammed Siraj and Harshit Rana breathing fire with the pink ball. Rohit himself warned Abhishek Nayar at one point to not talk tactics in such a public view after explaining some front-foot trigger movements to the assistant coach.Every block was cheered, every hit elicited a roar. Every victory for the bowler was celebrated. This was training as spectacle, nets as performance art.Such is the level of frenzy the Indian team arouses away from home that Australia's own open training session a couple of hours earlier seemed tepid in comparison, apart from minor injury scares to their struggling star batters Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne.Even without all the attention and cheery chaos, this would have been an important session, the team's first with the pink ball in moist twilight conditions, that dreaded time when the lacquer-coated, fancy-coloured orb wobbles unpredictably to raise the fear of leaving batting collapses in its wake.In Adelaide, where Australia have never lost a pink-ball Test, the surface tends to add fuel to the pink fire. No wonder India's batters want more time out in the nets to size up the challenge. The first Test of the 2020-21 series saw them collapse to their lowest-ever Test score of 36 in the second innings, but it's unlikely that the sour taste lingers, especially since India came back to win that series. This time it's about consolidating the advantage after the remarkable comeback win in Perth.Questions still linger about the team's opening plans, and no doubt these will gain ground over the next few days. On Tuesday evening, Rohit Sharma and Rishabh Pant took first strike, even before the warm-ups. When nets resumed, though, Perth openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul began proceedings, and Rohit and Pant again batted in tandem. India's captain may not be averse to batting in the middle order for the first time since 2019, but time - and conditions - will tell.Also on Tuesday, Australia's wicketkeeper Alex Carey took great pains to point out why the pink ball is so tough to spot, saying, ""At times when the lights come on, it can be a little bit of a depth perception. You have to watch the ball as closely as possible, adapt as quickly as possible. At times from behind the stumps, it (the ball) can seem to have a bit of a (pink) glow... sort of a tail. They have a comet tail.""Given the weird patterns of pink-ball Tests and the increasing uncertainty in players' minds, it may be fair to term it a format all on its own, another oddity in modern cricket's blend of styles. Here at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday, though, the practicality of pink Tests didn't seem to matter. Nothing did. The only star trails were left by India's cricketers.Will the festive air last if the team doesn't do well starting Friday? Gambhir, standing quietly in the corner, seemingly unmoved by all the noise, may have been thinking the same thing.",India's first training session under lights is an occasion to savour but important decisions await team ahead of crucial second Test against Australia.

Pakistan's wrist spinner, Sufiyan Muqeem , led his team to a resounding 10-wicket victory against Zimbabwe in the second T20I at Bulawayo, securing the series win. The match took place on Tuesday.Muqeem's exceptional spell of bowling saw him claim five wickets for just three runs in his four overs. Zimbabwe's innings rapidly unravelled as they were bowled out for a mere 57 runs in 12.4 overs. They had initially started promisingly.The 25-year-old’s remarkable figures are now the best ever recorded by a Pakistan bowler in T20I cricket. He surpassed Umar Gul 's previous record of 5 wickets for 6 runs. Gul achieved this feat twice, against New Zealand and South Africa.This five-wicket haul is Muqeem's first in T20Is, placing him in an exclusive group of Pakistani bowlers alongside Umar Gul and Imad Wasim Pakistan comfortably chased down the target in just 33 balls, reaching 61 without losing any wickets. Openers Saim Ayub (36) and Omair Yousuf (22) made light work of the chase. This victory followed their 57-run win in the first T20I on Sunday.Zimbabwe's opening batsmen, Brian Bennett (21) and Tadiwanashe Marumani (16), provided a solid start, putting on 37 runs for the first wicket in four overs. They were the only Zimbabwean batsmen to reach double figures.The dismissal of both openers within five balls triggered a dramatic collapse, with Zimbabwe losing their remaining wickets for only 20 runs. Muqeem’s devastating spell was the primary cause of this collapse.Marumani was caught by Tayyab Tahir at cover point, while Bennett was dismissed by Irfan Khan at deep square leg at Queens Sports Club.Sikandar Raza, Zimbabwe's experienced all-rounder and often their key batsman, was dismissed for only three runs. Abbas Afridi bowled him, uprooting his off stump.Raza was one of the four Zimbabwean bowlers who struggled to contain Pakistan's opening batsmen, Ayub and Yousuf. The Pakistani openers struck ten boundaries, including a six each, during their short but effective partnership.Ayub's boundary past backward point sealed the comprehensive victory for Pakistan.The third and final T20I between Pakistan and Zimbabwe is scheduled for Thursday.

NEW DELHI: A talented young cricketer, Prithvi Shaw has been facing challenges in his career recently. At the age of 25, he found himself unsold in the IPL auction , with no franchise showing interest in bidding for him, even at a base price of Rs 75 lakh.This situation has raised concerns about his future prospects and the factors contributing to his current predicament.Former England batter Kevin Pietersen , recognizing Shaw's talent, has offered his perspective on the matter.Pietersen believes that Shaw should focus his energies on getting super-fit and, more importantly, distance himself from social media distractions if he wants to regain his previous success.""Some of the greatest sports stories are COMEBACK stories. If Prithvi Shaw has decent people around him who care about his long term success, they'd sit him down, tell him to get off social media & train his absolute backside off in getting super fit. It'll get him back into the correct path where past success can return. Too talented to throw it all away. Love, KP!,"" the former England skipper wrote on 'X'.The issue of Shaw's off-field persona and its potential impact on his on-field performance has been highlighted by former Indian cricketer Mohammad Kaif and others.They suggest that Shaw's activities outside the game may have adversely affected his ability to consistently deliver on the field, leading to unfulfilled potential.Pietersen's advice to Shaw emphasizes the importance of surrounding himself with supportive individuals who genuinely care about his long-term success.He recommends that Shaw should temporarily disengage from social media and dedicate himself wholeheartedly to rigorous training and achieving optimal fitness levels.Pietersen believes that this approach could help Shaw rediscover the path that previously led him to success.Recently, Shaw's lack of fitness resulted in his exclusion from the Mumbai Ranji team . Although he has made a comeback in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament, his performances have been underwhelming so far.","Kevin Pietersen gives no-nonsense advice to Prithvi Shaw.

NEW DELHI: Pakistani bowler Sufiyan Muqeem achieved a remarkable feat in the second T20I against Zimbabwe on Tuesday in Bulawayo.His exceptional bowling performance earned him a place in an exclusive club of bowlers from Full Member nations who have taken a five-wicket haul in T20Is while conceding fewer than five runs.Muqeem's success can be attributed to his effective use of pace variation, top spin, and googly, which dismantled Zimbabwe's batting line-up.In a remarkable 2.4-over spell, he claimed five wickets for just three runs, recording the best-ever bowling figures for Pakistan in T20I cricket. His figures of 5/3 surpassed former pacer Umar Gul's record of 5/6 against New Zealand in 2009.Muqeem joined an elite group of bowlers who have achieved this rare feat, including Sri Lanka's Rangana Herath (5/3 against New Zealand in 2014), Afghanistan's Rashid Khan (5/3 against Ireland in 2017), and India's Bhuvneshwar Kumar (5/4 against Afghanistan in 2022).Muqeem's heroics ensured Zimbabwe's lowest total in T20I history, a mere 57 runs.

On this day 17 years ago, Muttiah Muralitharan etched his name in cricketing history by surpassing Shane Warne ’s record for the most Test wickets. The legendary Sri Lankan off-spinner achieved this milestone during a Test match against England in Kandy on December 3, 2007.Muralitharan’s record-breaking wicket came when he dismissed England’s Paul Collingwood , marking his 709th Test wicket, overtaking Warne's tally of 708.The moment was celebrated with immense joy, both on the field and in the cricketing world, as the Lankan wizard became the highest wicket-taker in Test history — a record he still holds to this day.Muralitharan’s achievement was remarkable not only for surpassing Warne but also for doing so in just his 116th Test match — 29 fewer than the Aussie leg-spinner.Known for his extraordinary ability to extract turn and bounce, Muralitharan’s artistry with the ball made him a nightmare for batters worldwide.His incredible work ethic, precision, and consistency enabled him to dominate across all conditions. By the time he retired in 2010, Muralitharan had taken800 Test wickets in just 133 matches, a feat considered nearly unbreakable.Beyond the numbers, Muralitharan's achievement symbolised his relentless dedication to the game and his ability to thrive under pressure. His record-breaking journey was also a source of pride for Sri Lanka, as he elevated the country's stature in international cricket.Seventeen years later, Muralitharan’s legacy continues to inspire budding cricketers, reminding the world of his unparalleled contributions to the sport and his status as one of the greatest bowlers in cricket history.","Muttiah Muralitharan took his 709th Test wicket on December 3, 2007.

How a change in batting position could well help Rohit Sharma in Tests

#LIVE: India vs Australia, Pink-Ball Test: Rohit Sharma's batting position, the ideal attack & more

NEW DELHI: Former England captain Alastair Cook has commended India's bold decision to exclude veteran off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin from their playing XI for the opening Test in Perth.Cook described the move as 'brave' given Ashwin's stature as one of the world's premier spinners and his ability to make an impact in any conditions. Cook also lauded India's decision to bat first on the bouncy Perth wicket.While some criticised the exclusion of Ashwin, Cook praised India for showing clarity in their tactics, emphasising that such calls reflect the evolving dynamism of modern cricket.Cook, the first England batter to surpass 10,000 Test runs, hailed India for their remarkable comeback after being dismissed for just 150 in the first Test.""I thought India was so brave. I thought that first, you know, they win the toss and bat on that wicket, you look there, even though there's only 150 they got, the thought process to say, 'we're going to take Australia on there. We know it's going to be hard, but we think it's going to be hard for both sides only, and then it'll be a one-innings game',"" Cook said on TNT Sports.""I think most captains would have bowled first, certainly would have done and probably got the end of a bad result, like normally in Australia. But India took it on brilliantly. It was just an all-round fantastic performance.""You think... bowled out for 150, you think we're struggling here, but to bounce back when you've got Boomer ( Jasprit Bumrah ) up with the new ball on those kinds of wickets, he's always going to be outstanding and backed up by the team,"" Cook added.Leading the side in Rohit Sharma's absence, pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah delivered a stellar performance, claiming eight wickets, including a first-innings five-for, to guide India to a memorable victory.Commenting on India's decision to exclude senior off-spinner Ashwin from the playing XI, Cook said, ""... Just think of how brave they were? They didn't bother playing Ashwin who has got 500 Test wickets. They've kind of played a couple of like, not makes you spinners, but you know, I thought Ashwin would have been outstanding, but you know, great thinking by them.""And isn't it nice to see Australia get thrashed?""","Alastair Cook hails India's bold decision to exclude Ravichandran Ashwin from playing XI for the opening Test in Perth.
