Rankireddy and Shetty, previously ranked number one globally, advanced as the leaders of Group C, setting up their encounter with Chia and Soh, who were the runners-up in Group A, trailing behind the world's top-ranked pair from China, Liang Wei Keng and Wang Chang.The Malaysian team, which once dominated the head-to-head record against the Indian shuttlers with eight consecutive wins, has recently faced three consecutive defeats in their latest matchups.A victory in this quarterfinal would potentially pit the Indian pair against the tournament's top seeds, Liang and Wang, assuming the latter triumphs over the Indonesian team of Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto in their quarterfinal match.The competition between the Indian and Malaysian pairs has always been fiercely contested, with both sides aspiring to clinch their country's first badminton gold medal in the Olympics.The Malaysian pair is recognized for their strategic prowess, precision, and fast-paced gameplay. In contrast, Rankireddy and Shetty are known for their aggressive playing style, which they will need to employ effectively from the start to overcome their opponents.Having previously experienced several defeats against Chia and Soh, the Indian pair managed to secure their first victory against the Malaysians at the Indonesia Open Super 1000 final in the previous year, followed by wins at the 2022 Asian Games individual event and the India Open.Elsewhere in the tournament, the second half of the draw features a match between the second-seeded Danish pair of Kim Astrup and Anders Rasmussen and the fourth-seeded Korean team of Kang Min Hyuk and Seo Seung Jae.Furthermore, Thailand's Supak Jomkoh and Kedren Kittinupong will compete against the Tokyo Olympic gold medallists Lee Yang and Wang Chi-Lin from Chinese Taipei, promising a series of compelling matches in the men's doubles category.","Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty to face Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik in quarterfinals.

CHATEAUROUX: ""No time to celebrate. My work is unfinished. There's a lot to play for,"" Manu Bhaker had said after winning her first Olympic medal on Sunday. There indeed was a lot more at stake. There was a date with history too. The belief that it was around the corner could be seen in the glint of her eyes, in the clenching of teeth when she smiled.Manu wanted another medal badly and she got it on Tuesday: a second bronze medal, which made her the first Indian after Independence to win two medals at the same Olympic Games.Norman Pritchard , a sprinter born in 1875 in then Calcutta, bagged two silver medals in the 1900 Games, which incidentally was also held in Paris . But that was 124 years ago, lost in the pages of India's Olympic history. While IOC lists him as an Indian, World Athletics credits his medals to Britain.Manu's second bronze came in the company of another 22-year-old, a first-time Olympian - the shy Sarabjot Singh - in 10m air pistol mixed team event.For Manu, it was a reward for believing in herself when she was going through a dark period. It was the karma thing she has been talking about here. ""Do your work - the hard yards - the result will come,"" she again said on Tuesday.The two medals… it is all sinking in, yes, but I must keep my emotions in check. I have one more event left to play,""Manu said. Two in the bag, but she is not done yet. Manu has been shooting well and a third medal one now looks a real possibility. The 25m pistol individual is her pet event.Manu showed her form again in the mixed battle for bronze. She looked composed when she walked in 30 minutes before the competition to set up her station. She did some shadow shooting, took a deep breath and walked out as if lost in thought. When she returned with Sarabjot for the competition, she looked ready. No sign of nerves. Sarabjot's face showed nothing, but he said later that he was feeling the pressure.The South Korean pair consisted of Lee Wanho and women's 10m air pistol individual gold medallist Oh Ye Jin. The way the Indians and the South Koreans shot was an interesting contrast to watch. Manu shot consistently. She had seven consecutive 10s. Sarabjot struggled a bit. Wanho shot like a dream, Jin had a night mare of a time. That made the difference.Manu started well with a 10.2. Sarabjot had a terrible 8.6. India was down 0-2. The winner needed to get to 16 first, which meant eight wins.Manu got 10.7 in the second try and Sarabjot shot a 10.5. The Koreans were way behind this time. 2-2. The Indians then hit a purple patch with both hitting 10s in their third and fourth tries to go up 6-2. Manu again shot a 10.5, Sarabjot managed just 9.6 but Jin's poor form helped. The Indians were up 8-2.That was when Wanho decided to find a rare zone. 10.8! It was 8-4 now. But the Koreans slipped again in the seventh shot and the Indians were cruising at 10-4.Then Manu had her first bad shot - 8.3. The Koreans had reduced the gap to 10-6. From there, it was 12-6 and 14-6. Jin's meltdown was surprising, not pretty to watch. The Indians were not complaining. They needed just two more points.Wanho staged a late comeback. He had not given up. He shot two consecutive 10.8s, which helped the Koreans reduce the gap again - 14-10. The 13th shot sealed the issue. Wanho shot a miserable 9. Manu had a 9.4, but Sarabjot shot 10.2. That was enough.India took two timeouts in between when the pressure seemed to mount. It helped them calm their nerves.Job done, Manu and Sarabjot stood on the stage with the Tricolour wrapped around their shoulders, and posed, as a small contingent of Indian supporters made quite some noise in the stands. It was the fans' time to get trigger happy.While the celebrations were on in the stands, Jaspal Rana was long gone. The medal assured, Manu's coach picked his bag, put on his shades and got up to leave. He accepted a hug and a handshake. ""Salute to you, Jaspal. You gave the girl confidence and courage."" He smiled, struggling to control his emotions and walked away swiftly.",Manu Bhaker becomes first Indian post-1947 to win 2 medals at 1 Olympic Games.

The two players displayed exceptional court movement, countering each other's shots and keeping the score tight throughout the match.In the opening game, Sen initially lost some points on his forecourt returns but adjusted his strategy by incorporating more cross-court shots. The game remained close, with the score fluctuating from 2-5 to 5-5 and later to 15-15.Sen then managed to secure a three-point lead when Chou made errors, including a long backhand and a netted return. Chou quickly rallied back, leveling the score at 18-all with three aggressive returns.Although Sen saved one game point, Chou clinched the first game with a powerful overhead smash.The second game continued the intense back-and-forth dynamic. Both players adapted their strategies to outmaneuver each other continuously. At 7-7, play was briefly interrupted when Sen requested a review on a close line call, which was ruled against him. Despite a brief conversation with the umpire, Sen maintained his composure and surged from 13-all to score five consecutive points.The third and final game saw a notable shift in momentum in favor of Sen. Chou began making uncharacteristic unforced errors, and his returns lost their precision. Sen, on the other hand, increased his pace and kept executing successful returns, smashes, and drop shots.Sen quickly amassed a 16-11 lead, outpacing Chou's attempts to close the gap.A superb cross-court smash gave Sen eight match-point chances and he sealed it when Chou hit the net after a flat exchange.","Lakshya Sen becomes the first Indian male shuttler to reach the semifinals at the Olympics.

WWE Survivor Series 2024 WarGames is the latest buzz in the wrestling community. Triple H recently announced that this year's event will be held on Saturday, November 30, at Rogers Arena in Vancouver, marking the first time Survivor Series will take place in the city. Following the announcement, fans began speculating about potential matches for the event.Many are particularly eager for a Brand Warfare showdown between Raw and SmackDown, along with other exciting faction matches.Survivor Series WarGames 2024 is set for Saturday, Nov 30, at Rogers Arena in Vancouver, and fans are already anticipating some epic clashes. Enthusiasts on X and Instagram are demanding for a classic Survivor Series Brand Warfare match under WarGames stipulations. They want to see one team from Raw and one from SmackDown face off in a brutal WarGames match. This idea has gained traction, and it seems WWE might indeed book a Brand Warfare match between Raw and SmackDown. The new WWE Survivor Series WarGames 2024 logo features red and blue colors, hinting at a possible Raw vs. SmackDown showdown. If this match happens, Survivor Series 2024 could be one of the greatest events in history.Beyond the Raw and SmackDown Brand Warfare, some fans are calling for a Bloodline Civil War at Survivor Series WarGames 2024. Fans are eager to see a clash between the Bloodline and Bloodline 2.0 in a WarGames match. Setting aside fan demands, a Bloodline Civil War in a WarGames match appears more logical due to the ongoing storyline. It's plausible that family members might collide against each other, and there's no better event than Survivor Series to settle scores.The rumors of a Bloodline Civil War is coming from the speculation about Roman Reigns ' rumored return. Roman is expected to make a comeback at this year's SummerSlam. If he returns at SummerSlam 2024, fans might witness a once-in-a-lifetime clash between the Samoan brothers. Roman is expected to return during the WWE Undisputed title match between Cody Rhodes and Solo Sikoa.In Roman's absence, Solo has been managing the Bloodline faction and is currently the Tribal Chief. Solo has done horrible things, including attacking Paul Heyman and mocking Roman Reigns on several occasions. Roman might return at SummerSlam to teach Solo Sikoa and other members Tama Tonga, Tanga Loa, and Jacob Fatu a lesson. Additionally, Roman might bring some of his cousins, like Zilla Fatu and Hikuleo, to collide against Solo Sikoa and his team, ultimately leading to a Bloodline Civil War at Survivor Series WarGames 2024.Furthermore, if Roman does not return at SummerSlam, he might make his comeback at Survivor Series later this year. However, if WWE aims to make this year's Survivor Series a standout event, they should bring Roman Reigns back at SummerSlam to kick off a Civil War storyline.","WWE Survivor Series 2024 WarGames is the latest buzz in the wrestling community.

NEW DELHI: In 1928, Indian hockey embarked on a journey that got written and rewritten in 'golden' words, where the team won medals for 10 Olympics in a row. The 44-year run of consecutive podium finishes included a period of 28 years that saw a couple of World Wars, India getting independence and six Olympic editions where the hockey team won six successive gold medals without losing a match.At the 1952 Helsinki Games, wrestler KD Jadhav won India's first post-independence individual medal, a bronze.It was the first occasion when the hockey team's medal had company. But what hockey kept waiting for, since winning its first medal on 26th May 1928, was an Indian 'team' from another sport to join it as an Olympic medal winner.That wait ended after 96 years on July 30th 2024, at the Paris Games when the shooting duo of Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh became the first Indian 'team' apart from hockey to win an Olympic medal.is how hockey legend and three-time Olympic medallist Harbinder Singh reacted in surprise when Timesofindia.com reached out to him over the phone for his reaction on the unique parallel of Manu and Sarabjot's bronze-medal win. The Indians defeated their South Korean opponents, Oh Ye Jin and Wonho Lee, 16-10 on Tuesday in the third-place playoff in the10m air pistol mixed team event.It was Manu's second medal of the Games, after she opened India's account in Paris with a bronze in the women's 10m air pistol individual event.""These two young kids have done well. Good for hockey to have company now with another team, as you pointed out. It never struck me,"" he added.""It still gives me goosebumps when I think of winning the gold medal by beating Pakistan in the (Tokyo) 1964 final, after we had lost to them in the final of the (Rome) 1960 Olympics,"" Harbinder recalled. ""I remember we landed at the Palam airport in Delhi and the entire airport was packed with fans who had come to welcome us.""Talking about similarities to hockey's 96-year wait for an Indian 'team' from another sport to win an Olympic medal, it took 44 years after KD Jadhav's 1952 bronze to have another individual Olympic medal winner from India. Tennis legend Leander Paes ended that wait with his men's singles bronze at Atlanta 1996.It took India 100 years to have a woman win an Olympic medal, a historic feat achieved by weightlifter Karnam Malleswari, who won a bronze at the Sydney Olympics in 2000. She waited 12 years for company in the form of badminton great Saina Nehwal and boxing legend Mary Kom as the next women Olympic medal winners from India.

Calcutta Boy

Football Hero

Hollywood Calling

Manu Bhaker made history as the first Indian athlete , post Independence, to win two medals in the same Olympic Games by securing a bronze medal in the 10m air pistol mixed team event with Sarabjot Singh. Two days earlier, she had claimed India's first medal at the Paris Olympics , becoming the first Indian female shooter to win an Olympic medal.Before that there was another ‘Indian’ who managed that task, even though the history records have a minor quibble over whether he qualified as British or Indian.What is not in dispute is that he won two silver medals at the Paris Games 1900, the same venue where Bhaker made history. He was also the first person to score a hat-trick in an official football match on Indian soil and also the first Olympian to become a star in ‘silent’ Hollywood. And he did it in Paris as well. Of course, pedantic folks could argue that Bhaker won her second medal in a mixed team event while Pritchard won his medals in individual events.Pritchard’s nationality also remained a prickly affair. In 2000, British Olympic historian, the late Ian Buchanan, had claimed that the silver medals Pritchard won (in 200m and 200m hurdles) should be awarded to Great Britain. While it’s true that Pritchard was chosen to represent Great Britain after competing in the British AAA championship, the International Olympic Committee credits India for the medals.Norman Pritchard, born on June 23, 1875, in Calcutta (now Kolkata), India, holds a unique place in the annals of Olympic history . He was the first Indian and Asian-born athlete to win an Olympic medal, achieving this feat at the 1900 Paris Olympics. He was also the first person to score a hat-trick in a professional football game, a founding member of the Indian Football Association and later the first Olympian to participate inPritchard was the son of George Petersen Pritchard, an Englishman who managed a family business in India. He grew up in a well-to-do family, which provided him access to excellent education and opportunities in sports. His athletic talents were nurtured at St. Xavier's College in Calcutta, where he excelled in sprinting and hurdling, quickly gaining recognition in regional athletic meets. His speed and agility were unparalleled at the time, setting the stage for his future successes.In 1900, Pritchard travelled to Paris to compete in the Summer Olympics, a groundbreaking moment as he became the first athlete from India to participate in the Olympics. He competed in the 200 meters, 200 meters hurdles, and 110 meters hurdles. His performance was outstanding; he won silver medals in both the 200 meters and 200 meters hurdles, marking the first time an athlete from India had won Olympic medals. In the 200 meters hurdles, Pritchard set a then Olympic record of 26.8 seconds in the semi-finals, and in the final, he clocked 26 seconds to win silver, behind USA’s Alvin Kraenzlein, who set a new Olympic record.Beyond his Olympic feats, Pritchard also had a notable football career. He is credited with scoring the first hat-trick in an open football tournament in India while playing for St. Xavier's College against Sovabazar in July 1897. He served as the Secretary of the Indian Football Association from 1900 to 1902, contributing significantly to the development of the sport in India.After his Olympic success, Pritchard moved to England and later to the United States, where he transitioned into a career in the entertainment industry. Even how he transitioned to Hollywood is a remarkable story.In December 1906, during a dinner in London, Norman Pritchard was asked to recount the grandeur of the 1899 durbar in Delhi, held to welcome Lord Curzon as the Viceroy of India. His vivid and dramatic description was so compelling that Sir Charles Wyndham, a prominent figure in theatre, mistook him for an actor and invited him to play a minor role in ""The Stronger Sex"" at the Apollo Theatre in 1907.Pritchard's performance was successful, prompting Sir Charles to encourage him to pursue acting seriously. Pritchard made his Broadway debut in the United States with ""The Elder Son"" at the Playhouse Theatre on September 15, 1914. In 1919, he played a significant role in a strike action at the Schubert Theater in Washington, leading a boycott as a member of the trade union, The Equity, to demand better wages for actors.Adopting the stage name Norman Trevor, he found a niche in Hollywood as a character actor. He appeared in numerous films and Broadway productions, gaining moderate success. His Broadway debut came with ""The Elder Son"" at the Playhouse Theatre in 1914. He went on to act in 26 plays and 27 movies, making his big screen debut in silent movies with ""After Dark"" in 1915 and ending with ""Tonight at Twelve,"" released in 1929, the year of his death.Pritchard passed away on October 31, 1929, in Norwalk, California, under tragic circumstances. His obituary stated that he died of a ""brain malady,"" and it is now speculated that he may have been suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Despite his relatively early death, his legacy endures, particularly in India, where he is celebrated as a pioneer in athletics. His accomplishments paved the way for future generations of Indian athletes, inspiring them to compete on the world stage.","Norman Pritchard was the first Indian and Asian-born athlete to win an Olympic medal, achieving this feat at the 1900 Paris Olympics.

If she faces any fertility issues, Vance said he would try anything to help her because he is pro-family. Vance defended that what he said about 'childless cat ladies' remark was not for those who can not conceive but those who are anti-child ethically -- like Democrat politicians.Megan also criticized Jennifer for not speaking out against gender ideology and transgender issues. She asked why Jennifer did not take a stand for little girls whose breasts were chopped off. She continued the attack after prominent voices across the world spoke out against the transgender 'boxing row'.The International Olympic Committee said it was not a transgender issue and condemned the abuse directed at Imane Khelif.

'We are in Paris to give India its 9th Olympic hockey gold': Captain Harmanpreet promises the nation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/we-are-in-paris-to-give-india-its-9th-olympic-hockey-gold-captain-harmanpreet-promises-the-nation/articleshow/112237660.cms,"Every time adrenaline gushes through Harmanpreet's forearms to send those drag-flicks whizzing past defenders and bring the opponent post crashing down in Paris, mind goes back to the January evening of 2023 in Bhubaneswar. A dejected India skipper, carrying the nation's hopes on his penalty-corner skills, appeared clueless. The ball almost refused to roll up his stick on those flicks.The New Zealanders sent India out of the World Cup.It was not even the quarterfinal. Dream dusted in the crossovers, a desperate D-top flick by Harmanpreet during one-on-one shootout against the Kiwi custodian defined the tournament for India and its skipper.Head hung in disappointment, Harmanpreet dragged himself to the mandatory press conference along with Graham Reid, who almost knew it was his last meeting with the media as the India coach.It was about a year and half to go for the Paris Olympics then. Hockey India brought in a new coach in Craig Fulton, and his partnership with Harmanpreet as the team's think-tank has not just won India titles, including the Asian Games gold, but also saw Harmanpreet returning with his lethal short-corner skills that have taken India to the quarterfinals of theParis Games .With six goals in five matches, Harmanpreet is playing like Rocky Balboa returning to the ring.India's two slightly nervous opening matches were salvaged by Harmanpreet's last-minute goals, resulting in a 3-2 win over New Zealand and a 1-1 draw against the 2016 Olympic champions Argentina. The clean sheet in the 2-0 win over Ireland, courtesy Harmanpreet's brace, was comforting. But the real test at the pool stage was always going to be defending Olympic champions Belgium and nemesis Australia.With a place in the quarterfinals sealed before the two big games, India gave the Belgians a run for their money before losing 1-2. But the story of the men's hockey competition so far was written in the match against Australia.After 52 years, India finally managed to bell the cat and beat the Aussies in an Olympic match -- the last instance being a 3-1 win at the Munich Games in 1972.Harmanpreet's stick continued to fire, scoring two goals in India's 3-2 win, taking the tally of his international goals to 190 in 224 matches.Opposite to the trend against the Aussies over the years, it was India who led 2-1 at half-time, showing the promise that the team wants to deliver on in Paris.“That's what we are looking for -- to give India its ninth (hockey) gold. We are giving (it our) everything to win that gold medal,"" Harmanpreet told FIH (International Hockey Federation) after the win over Australia.""But the main tournament is starting now. So the quarterfinals, the semifinals, those matches are very crucial. So we're just looking to give our best,” said the two-time FIH Men’s Player of the Year.Having finished second in Pool B with 10 points, India will take on Pool A's third-placed team, Great Britain. The match is scheduled for 1:30 pm IST on August 4.Decoding the historic win over Australia, Harmanpreet said: ""We started (the Paris Olympics by) winning, and we decided we were going to finish with a winning match. We put them under pressure and the pressure was so good from the frontline. And our motto was to score the first goal. So we did it and I think after that we managed very well. Because everybody knows that the Australians come full press, so the positioning and scanning was good today, the way we managed the ball.""The real tournament, though, begins with the knockouts, where the losing team packs its bags to go home. And Harmanpreet summed it up in few and precise words.""There's no room to make mistakes.""","Harmanpreet scored two goals in India's 3-2 win over Australia. India finished second in Pool B with 10 points. India will take on Pool A's third-placed team, Great Britain, on August 4. India beat Australia for the first time in 52 years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112237765,imgsize-61570,width-400,resizemode-4/112237765.jpg"

India's run-chase in the first ODI against Sri Lanka at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Friday ended 13 balls early when they needed just one run to win the game with two wickets in hands.Sri Lanka skipper Charith Asalanka (3 for 30) took matters in his hands and struck twice off successive deliveries to end the game in a stange and dramatic tie with the wickets of Shivam Dube and Arshdeep Singh , who tried to hit a boundary when all he was required to do was to tap it around to find the single run needed for victory.Sri Lanka scored a competitive 230 for 8 after opting to bat first, led by half-centuries from opener Pathum Nissanka (56) and Dunith Wellalage (67) lower down the order against a disciplined Indian bowling attack that shared the spoils and was led by left-arm spinner Axar Patel's 2 for 33.Arshdeep, who took 2 for 47 earlier, ended the game on the wrong note when he tried a big heave on the leg-side down on one knee, but missed connection and was hit on the back leg to be adjudged out lbw. He went for the review, but all the parameters were in bowler's favour on replays.The left-arm Indian pacer's effort with the bat led to fans trolling him for trying to go for glory, when he was expected to keep a cool head and find a single.India's run-chase was set up by skipper Rohit Sharma's 47-ball 58 and his 75-run opening partnership with Shubman Gill (18), but Wellalage (2 for 39) removed both the Indian openers with his left-arm spin in quick succession to bring the hosts back in the game.Wanindu Hasaranga then kept India on the backfoot with his spell of 3 for 58, which included the important wickets of Virat Kohli (24) just when he looked to have got his eye in and KL Rahul, who was also well set at 31.Axar (33) and Dube (25) then kept India in the chase, but it didn't prove enough. Dube was the penultimate wicket to fall, after which the last-wicket pair of Arshdeep and Mohammed Siraj needed to score just one run. However, Arshdeep tried to hit Asalaka for a boundary and faltered in the process.He was heavily trolled on social media by the fans after the match.However, there were also fans who came out to support Arshdeep, who was India's highest wicket-taker in the T20 World Cup triumph earlier this year in June.",India's run-chase in the first ODI against Sri Lanka ended 13 balls early.

beats

Australia

in Olympics for first time since 1972, ends 2nd in Pool B

PARIS: This was a match to decide where India would finish on the points table in Pool B of the hockey competition - a match against a team India have suffered against over the years. In fact, India had not beaten Australia since the 1972 Munich Games in the Olympics.One would not have blamed the Indian supporters for being a bit apprehensive at the Yves-du-Manoir Stadium here on Friday afternoon.For the Indian team, there was nothing to look back at. It was a clean slate. Ahead of them, on Pitch 2, was a rival they had to beat. They were ready, they were motivated, and they won it 3-2, fighting till the last second.It was a long time coming. 52 years to be precise, and it felt good to have witnessed that.What stood out in India's victory was their outstanding defence - when the Aussies counter-attacked or when they got the penalty corners. Their off-the-ball running was spot on. They tried to close the channels in the midfield, which was manned well by veteran Manpreet Singh and Hardik Singh. If the Aussies attacked through the flanks, the defenders, midfielders and even the strikers fought together to thwart them.""We knew that they could be very dangerous in counter-attacks. We had decided that we would win the one-on-one battles, concede penalty corners but not give them a free run at our goal. We have a good penalty corner defence. We also kept changing our strategy according to the situation. We kept calling each other out when we needed man-to-man marking or zonal marking. It worked,"" Manpreet said later.The defence was the platform which the strikers used very well to hit the Aussies hard. In fact, India's first goal came through field play in the opening quarter. On an attack from the left in the 12th minute, Lalit Upadhyay hit hard at the goal and Abhishek slammed the rebound off the goalkeeper Andrew Charter's pads.This came after Indian goalkeeper PR Sreejesh had made two superb saves in the initial minutes. The 36-year-old- playing in his last Olympics- like always was a rock in the goal.Even as the Kookaburras were looking to hit back, came the second goal. In the very next minute (13th minute), the Aussies tried to clear a long ball in their circle and conceded a penalty corner. Skipper Harmanpreet Singh , who already had four goals in his bag here, got his fifth one, hitting flat and straight through the middle to slam the board.In the second quarter, Australia pulled one back Craig Thomas' penalty corner conversion. It was an indirect combination. A string of five passes beat the Indian defenders. At 2-1, India knew they needed to score more to ensure they got full points.It came just minutes into the third quarter. India won a penalty corner, their third, which was saved on the goal-line by an Aussie player. India asked for a video referral which revealed a foul and a penalty stroke was rewarded. Harmanpreet had no trouble slotting it home. At 3-1, India had a cushion.In the last quarter, India seemed to have gone up 4-1 as Abhishek scored in a goal-line melee. The Aussies called for a video referral which showed a foul by Mandeep Singh before the final finish.Relieved, the Aussies pressed and got their second when a penalty stroke was given for a foul inside the Indian circle. Blake Govers scored to make it 2-3. It stayed that way as Sreejesh made a valiant save in the dying seconds.The goalkeeper later said that the strategy worked. ""We played well against Belgium too on Thursday but failed to take our chances. Today, our forwards seized the opportunity. That worked for us. Yes, we defended very well.""When asked about the 'Win it for Sreejesh' campaign, he said: ""It feels good. I am trying my best not to disappoint fans back home. I got a couple of knocks in the end; my ribs are swollen but I am happy.""",India had not beaten Australia since the 1972 Munich Games in the Olympics.

She has already won two bronze medals in the 10m air pistol and 10m air pistol mixed team events, partnering with Sarabjot Singh.Bhaker's performance is particularly noteworthy as she is the reigning world champion in the 25m event. If she secures a podium finish on Saturday, she will become the first Indian athlete to achieve three successive Olympic medals in a single edition.Star shuttler Lakshya Sen achieved a significant milestone in the evening, defeating Chinese Taipei's Chou Tien Chen 19-21, 21-15, 21-12 to advance to the semifinals.With the win, Sen became the frst Indian male badminton player to enter Olympic semis. Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu previously reached similar feat in women's game.Lakshya's next match will be against the winner of the clash between 2021 world champion Loh Kean Yew from Singapore and Olympic champion Viktor Axelsen of Denmark. If Lakshya wins, he will be guaranteed at least a silver medal. If he loses, he will still have an opportunity to compete for a bronze medal in the playoff.The day also saw disappointment as the mixed archery team of Ankita Bhakat and Dhiraj Bommadevara finished in fourth place.They lost to the USA 2-6 in a closely contested bronze medal play-off.The pair initially showed promise to secure India's first-ever Olympic medal in archery but faltered in the critical moments after losing to defending champions Korea in the semifinals.India's hockey team defeated Australia 3-2 at the Olympic Games, marking their first win against the formidable opponents since 1972.The victory secured India the second position in Pool B.Harmanpreet Singh, the team captain, scored twice in the match, contributing significantly to India's victory over the Tokyo Games silver medallists in their final pool game.Despite having already secured a spot in the quarterfinals, the Indian team played with determination and controlled most of the game, surprising the Kookaburras, who they last triumphed over in the 1972 Munich Olympics ""It was an important match. We needed a match like this before the quarterfinals. From the start we put them under pressure. It's a proud moment to beat Australia,"" a proud Harmanpreet said after the match.Veteran goalkeeper PR Sreejesh, playing in his last international tournament, was instrumental in the win, making crucial saves to prevent the Australians from scoring.Shubhankar Sharma delivered two eagles in his second round but lost four shots mid-game, resulting in a two-under 69, placing him 25th in the golf competition.Combined with his first-round 70, he stands at three-under after two days at Le Golf National near Paris.The other Indian participant, Gaganjeet Bhullar, improved on his first round score of 75 with a two-under 69 and is now tied for 52nd.Asian Games-medallist shooter Esha Singh ended 18th in the 25m pistol qualification at the Paris Olympics.Judoka Tulika Mann lost in her opening round against London Games champion Idalys Ortiz, while rower Balraj Panwar finished 23rd in the men's single sculls event.Esha scored a total of 581, with 291 in precision and 290 in rapid, finishing 18th out of 40 shooters.

India captain Rohit Sharma was in full flow with the bat during the practice sessions in Sri Lanka after joining the ODI squad for the three-match series beginning on Friday, and one of his big hits in the nets got even head coach Gautam Gambhir looking skywards to see where the ball was headed.After announcing his retirement from T20Is following India's T20 World Cup triumph in the Caribbean on June 29 this year, a well-rested Rohit is back to lead India in 50-over internationals.Also returning to the squad is Virat Kohli, who also decided to retire from T20Is after India became the T20 world champions.But it didn't take time for the two seasoned pros to get back in the groove for the longer version of white-ball cricket , as both Rohit and Virat had a good feel of the Sri Lankan conditions, which, however, are not much dissimilar to India.During one of the training sessions in Colombo , with Rohit facing the bowlers in the nets, the skipper launched himself into a big aerial shot. With head coach Gambhir close by, the shot drew his attention instantaneously as he watched it sailing with an emotion of awe writ large on his face.The first ODI of the three-match series will be played on Friday at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, followed by the second and the concluding game on July 4 and 7 at the same venue.In the T20I leg of the tour, India were led by Suryakumar Yadav who inspired the team to a 3-0 whitewash of the hosts, which the visitors completed with a dramatic 'Super Over' win in the last match of the series.",Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli return to India's ODI squad for Sri Lanka tour.

NEW DELHI: Imane Khelif ’s Olympic journey in Paris began with a victory shrouded in controversy, setting the stage for a dramatic and polarizing narrative.The Algerian boxer , who had been reinstated for the Games despite a previous disqualification from the 2023 World Championships due to a failed gender eligibility test, found herself at the centre of a storm before she even stepped into the ring.In her opening bout, Khelif faced Italy’s Angela Carini , a seasoned fighter with high expectations.However, the match ended abruptly after just 46 seconds, a rare occurrence in Olympic boxing .Carini, visibly distraught and bleeding from her nose, cited intense pain from the initial exchanges as the reason for her sudden withdrawal.She vehemently denied any political motivation behind her decision, saying, ""If an athlete is this way, and in that sense it’s not right or it is right, it’s not up to me to decide. I just did my job as a boxer. I got into the ring and fought. I did it with my head held high and with a broken heart for not having finished the last kilometre.”Yet, the tension was palpable when Carini refused to shake Khelif’s hand after the fight.Carini’s refusal to engage in the customary post-fight handshake was seen by many as a silent protest, though she insisted it was merely a result of her physical distress. The incident, however, intensified the scrutiny on Khelif’s presence at the Games.Khelif is not a transgender athlete .She was born female but has a disorder of sex development (DSD) that results in XY chromosomes and testosterone levels similar to those of male athletes.The IOC's Framework on Fairness, Inclusion, and Non-discrimination based on gender identity and sex variations provides guidelines for sports federations to promote inclusion and fairness, particularly for athletes with Differences of Sexual Development (DSD).DSD encompasses a group of rare conditions that affect genes, hormones, and reproductive organs.Individuals with DSDs may be raised as female but possess XY chromosomes and testosterone levels typically found in males.Despite the controversy, Khelif, a silver medalist at the 2022 IBA World Championships, remains undeterred in her Olympic aspirations.Her next challenge is a quarterfinal bout against Hungarian trailblazer Anna Luca Hamori, a match that holds significant weight. A victory would not only secure Khelif an Olympic medal but also potentially reignite the ethical and sporting debates surrounding her eligibility.",Algerian boxer Imane Khelif is not a transgender athlete.

Hopefully, we will get to listen to several more one-liners,” Surya was heard saying with a smile in a video shared by the BCCI after India's T20I series win.Surya was appointed India's full-time T20I skipper ahead of allrounder Hardik Pandya, a topic that became a hot debate in India before BCCI announced the white-ball squads for the Sri Lanka tour.India whitewashed Sri Lanka 3-0 in the T20I leg of the tour.In the last match of the series, Surya was celebrated as a bowling hero when he decided to bring himself on to bowl the last over when Sri Lanka required just six runs to win. The 33-year-old Surya not just picked up two wickets in the over but also restricted Sri Lanka to five runs, which took the match to a 'Super Over' tie-breaker.It was Surya's boundary that won India the match in the 'Super Over'.With Rohit and Virat Kohli back in the squad for ODIs, India will look to continue the winning momentum.

Andre Russell says more than money behind West Indies stars' Test absence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/andre-russell-says-more-than-money-behind-west-indies-stars-test-absence/articleshow/112232320.cms,"NEW DELHI: London Spirit's Andre Russell has asserted that the primary reason some prominent West Indies cricketers have turned away from Test cricket and focused on limited-overs formats is a lack of interest rather than a lack of financial incentives.The West Indies, once a dominant force in cricket, recently suffered a 3-0 Test series defeat against England.Notably, several current Caribbean star players were absent from the series, instead preparing for their lucrative participation in the English domestic cricket competition, The Hundred.Russell is among five West Indian players in the highest £125,000 ($160,000) salary bracket for this year's edition of The Hundred. He is joined by his Spirit teammate Shimron Hetmyer , Nicholas Pooran at Northern Superchargers, Rovman Powell at Trent Rockets, and Kieron Pollard at Southern Brave.Despite their reputations as dynamic batsmen in franchise cricket, Pooran, Powell, and Pollard have never played a single Test match, while Russell's sole appearance in the red-ball format came back in 2010.For a considerable time, it has been widely believed that the limited financial resources of Cricket West Indies have made franchise cricket a highly appealing choice for players from the Caribbean. However, according to Russell, there are other factors at play when examining the reasons behind the decision of many regional players to curtail their first-class careers prematurely.""I don't think it's the money, I don't think money is the issue,"" he told Britain's PA news agency, as quoted by AFP.""Based on the amount of T20 and leagues around the world, I think a lot of players are just not interested in playing Tests.""The 36-year-old added: ""I'm always excited watching the other West Indian batters, especially when they're hitting boundary after boundary.""As long as you can do well from contracts outside your nation I think they are going to grab that opportunity but everyone wants to play on the big stage.""So, if the big stage comes in Test cricket, I know youngsters will be happy to play. I just don't think it's about money or anything like that.""Russell expressed his empathy towards his compatriots after their devastating 3-0 defeat against England in the recently concluded Test series. The entire series lasted a mere 10 days, despite being originally scheduled for 15.""Red-ball cricket is not my cookie, I don't think my body will keep up with Test cricket,"" Russell explained. ""But those in the team at the moment are fit enough and taking on the challenge.""They had a few moments in the Test series where they could have turned things around.

We batted well in patches but there was no consistent momentum. We started well but knew the game would start once spin comes on. We lost a few wickets and fell behind,"" skipper Rohit said, as quoted by PTI, at the post-match presentation ceremony.India staged a recovery with a 57-run partnership between Rahul and Axar Patel, who contributed 33 runs.

Indian batters choke as Sri Lanka earn a dramatic tie in ODI series opener,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/sri-lanka-in-india/indian-batters-choke-as-sri-lanka-earn-a-dramatic-tie-in-odi-series-opener/articleshow/112231396.cms,"NEW DELHI: The first ODI between India and Sri Lanka at Colombo ended in a thrilling tie, highlighting India's vulnerability against quality spin bowling despite a dominant performance from skipper Rohit Sharma .Chasing a modest target of 231, India were propelled by Rohit's blistering 58 off 47 balls. His innings, studded with powerful strokes and aggressive intent, contrasted sharply with the struggles of his teammates against a disciplined Sri Lankan spin attack.Rohit's dismissal, adjudged leg-before off Dananjaya, exposed India's fragility against spin.The pitch, which seemed benign during Rohit's innings, began to offer turn and variable bounce, troubling the Indian middle order.KL Rahul (31 off 43 balls), known for his measured approach, struggled to rotate the strike, putting pressure on the incoming batsmen. Virat Kohli (23), Shreyas Iyer (24), and Axar Patel (33) all got starts but failed to convert them into substantial scores.Sri Lanka's spinners, led by Wanindu Hasaranga (3/58), Akila Dananjaya (1/40), Dunith Wellalage (2/39), and skipper Charith Asalanka (3/30), bowled with discipline and guile, choking the run flow and picking up wickets at crucial junctures. Asalanka, in particular, turned the tide in Sri Lanka's favour with two wickets in two balls, pushing India on the back foot.Earlier, Sri Lanka, opting to bat first, were bolstered by crucial half-centuries fromPathum Nissanka (56) and debutant Dunith Wellalage (67*). Nissanka anchored the innings with a composed knock, while Wellalage displayed maturity and confidence beyond his years, guiding Sri Lanka past the 200-run mark.The Indian bowlers, despite the eventual tie, performed admirably on a helpful surface. Mohammed Siraj struck early, while Shivam Dube , returning to ODIs after a five-year hiatus, impressed with a wicket. Kuldeep Yadav, though wicketless, bowled economically, keeping the pressure on the Sri Lankan batsmen.The match, ultimately ending in a tie thanks to late hitting from Shivam Dube, exposed India's over-reliance on Rohit Sharma and their susceptibility against spin. It served as a timely reminder that despite boasting a formidable batting lineup, India needs to address their vulnerability against spin bowling to achieve consistent success in the ODI format.","India and Sri Lanka play out thrilling tie in first ODI in Colombo.

Mohammed Shami eyes India return through domestic cricket,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/mohammed-shami-eyes-india-return-through-domestic-cricket/articleshow/112231109.cms,"KOLKATA: Mohammed Shami is still not sure when he would be able to wear the India jersey again, but the pacer has decided to make his comeback through domestic cricket. Shami, who is recuperating from an ankle surgery which he underwent in February this year, has already started bowling at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru. However, he is yet to bowl at full throttle.“It’s difficult to say when I will be back. I am trying hard but hopefully you will get to see me in Bengal colours before I don the India jersey again,” he said while being felicitated by the East Bengal club in Kolkata.“I will come to play two-three matches for Bengal and will come fully prepared for it,” he added, making him available for the upcoming domestic season.Interestingly, BCCI secretary Jay Shah has also asked centrally-contracted India players to “prove” themselves in domestic cricket if they aspire to play for the country.The 33-year-old pacer said the injury came to hurt him at a time when he was trying to recover from India’s ODI World Cup final defeat.“We never thought the injury would be this serious. The plan was to address it after the T20 World Cup since we had the IPL and the ICC T20 mega event coming almost back-to-back after last year’s World Cup. But it turned worse during the ODI World Cup itself and I also did not find it right to risk playing on with it,” he recalled. “Even the doctors could not fathom that the injury will take such a serious turn and will take so much time to heal,” the pacer said.India’s highest wicket-taker in the 2023 World Cup, Shami thus had to miss this year’s IPL and also watched India’s T20 World Cup triumph sitting at home.“To tell you frankly, I got tense when South Africa were pulling things back in the final. For a moment memories of our 2023 WC final loss returned to haunt me. But luckily Suryakumar Yadav took that great catch to fetch us the Cup and it took time to sink in that India have actually won it,” Shami stated.Former India skipper Sourav Ganguly , who was also honoured in the evening, also looked forward to Shami’s comeback.“I am actually surprised to see Shami has played only 101 ODI matches. Somebody with his calibre and talent should have played many more,” Ganguly said.The former BCCI chief remembered seeing Shami first while playing for Bengal in late 2000s.“Laxmi (Ratan Shukla) was the Bengal skipper then and I immediately told him that this boy (Shami) is an exceptional talent. I am happy to see him converting that talent into performance,” he added.“It’s said that (Jasprit) Bumrah is the best pacer, but Bumrah has become the best because he got Shami at the other end. So you have pressure from both ends,” Ganguly pointed out.","Mohammed Shami is still not sure when he would be able to wear the India jersey again.

NEW DELHI: Virender Sehwag , one of India's greatest Test openers, expressed his approval of youngsters starting their cricket journeys with T20, if it helps them develop an aggressive streak that enhances their Test performances.Speaking at an event in New Delhi on Friday, where he was revealed as the Brand Ambassador for the inaugural Delhi Premier League (DPL), Sehwag acknowledged that the allure and financial viability of T20 cricket are strong attractors for young players.Sehwag highlighted the evolving nature of Test cricket by referencing England's current style of playing Test matches, where they score at a rate of five runs per over. He reminisced about how Australia scored at four runs per over during his own playing days. He emphasized his belief in the value of attacking play in Test matches, saying it presents more opportunities to secure wins for the team.""The manner in which England is playing Test cricket, scoring at five runs an over. In our playing days, Australia used to score at 4 runs per over. I have always believed that if you can attack, then you give your team more chances to win the Test matches,"" Sehwag was quoted as saying by PTI.When questioned about the potential of numerous T20 leagues diverting youngsters' focus away from red-ball cricket, Sehwag mentioned his personal experience with his 17-year-old son, who has played three-day cricket for Delhi U16. He noted that without the presence of IPL during his own youth, the aspirations then were different compared to now when youngsters have the IPL and DPL as platforms.""Look, my elder son is 17 and he played three-day cricket for Delhi U16 but there are a lot of boys who might be waiting for that opportunity. When we were 18, there was no IPL. But, now, a youngster might think of playing IPL, and DPL gives you that opportunity,"" he mentioned.Sehwag further explained his outlook on aggressive gameplay benefiting Test cricket by saying, ""So, if anyone develops an aggressive game that can suit Test cricket, then why not? After all, we would like people to come and watch Tests.""Addressing his own aggressive style of play in Test cricket even before the start of IPL, Sehwag responded humorously when asked about his approach.
