PATNA/KOLKATA: A 13-year-old teen who doesn't talk much but lets his bat do all the talking was snapped by Rajasthan Royals for Rs 1.10 crore after an intense bidding at the IPL auction, making him the youngest player to play the world's biggest cricket league.On Monday evening, at faraway Jeddah, the young Bihar prodigy's name, Vaibhav Suryavanshi , was engraved on the annals of Indian Premier League (IPL) when he became the youngest player ever at the age of 13 years and 243 days to land an IPL contract.Vaibhav entered the 2025 IPL mega auction at a base price of Rs 30 lakh as the youngest ever to be listed in the 16-year history of the league. The southpaw was finally bought by the Royals, who outbid intense fight from Delhi Capitals to get the talented teenager with a staggering price.""He is a kind of player who has come on earth to play cricket and go back. He settles for nothing else,"" said Bihar Ranji coach Pramod Kumar.Kumar, under whose watchful eyes Vaibhav is honing his cricketing skills, said the young southpaw is curious to learn various aspects of the game and has a sharp mind.""He can hardly talk. But ask him about cricket and he can go on day and night. He never takes any rest on the ground. Even during lunch or tea break, he is with me for fielding practice or knocking away or stretching with a senior player,"" he said.Records came hand-in-hand with Vaibhav as he recently made headlines after becoming the youngest international centurion in the 170-year history of competitive cricket at 13 years and 188 days in September this year.The opener scored a 62-ball 104, studded with 14 hits to the fence and four towering sixes, in the 1st youth test for India Under-19 against Australia Under-19 in Chennai.Vaibhav reached the three-figure mark in just 58 balls, which made him the fastest Indian youth test centurion, too, and the second-fastest in the world.Hailing from Samastipur, Bihar, he was the youngest debutant in Ranji Trophy history when he played against Mumbai at just 12 years and 284 days. With this feat, the rookie broke records held for years by the likes of Yuvraj Singh and Sachin Tendulkar.""He has always been getting attention from the crowd where he went to play Ranji trophy for being the youngest player and his enthusiasm on the ground,"" the coach says, adding he has no fear of fast bowling despite being the youngest in the team.Sanjeev Suryavanshi, a small farmer in Tajpur, Samastipur, and a part-time journalist with Hindi daily, was on cloud nine when his son Vaibhav called up from Dubai, where he is playing Asia Cup U-19 championship. His first match will be against Pakistan on November 30.""Rajasthan Royals (RR) and Delhi Capitals (DC) both had called him up for trial in Nagpur and Delhi. In Nagpur, he was asked to score 17 runs in one over. He hit three huge sixes in first three balls itself, making him a strong contender for RR team. He performed excellently in DC trials also. That's why DC was also interested in buying my son,"" the proud father said, while talking to TOI.Sanjeev recently sold his one kattha of land in Tajpur for the better future of his son's dream.Vaibhav is also the fourth youngest in the country to make first-class debut and the second youngest from Bihar when he played against Mumbai in Patna on January 6.Vaibhav played for Bihar in the 2023 edition of the Cooch Behar Trophy . In one of the matches against Jharkhand, he scored 151 runs off 128 balls with the help of 22 fours and three sixes. In the same match, he also scored 76. He also played in a quadrangular series involving India U-19 A, India U-19 B, England U-19 and Bangladesh U-19. He got scores of 53, 74, 0, 41 and 0 in the tournament. So far he has played 5 first-class games.Suryavanshi's meteoric rise in the last couple of years is more incredible in the backdrop of the controversy-ravaged Bihar cricket , which has made more news for wrong reasons ever since coming back into BCCI domestic fold from oblivion ahead of the 2018-19 Ranji Trophy.","Bihar prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi, 13, becomes youngest player to play in IPL. Rajasthan Royals snapped him up for Rs 1.10 crore after intense bidding at auction. He is the youngest player ever to be listed in the 16-year history of the league. He was the youngest debutant in Ranji Trophy history when he played against Mumbai.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115682182,imgsize-28070,width-400,resizemode-4/115682182.jpg"
World Chess Championship: Gukesh gets early wakeup call as Ding Liren takes exciting win in Game 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/world-chess-championship-gukesh-gets-early-wakeup-call-as-ding-liren-takes-exciting-win-in-game-1/articleshow/115686808.cms,"D Gukesh and Ding Liren during game one of the WCC on Monday. (Photo by Roslan Rahman/AFP via Getty Images)

THE MOVES:

D Gukesh was ready to pounce, but he was not fully prepared for the counter-attack.Reigning world champion Ding Liren , 32, gave the 18-year-old Indian challenger a 'wake up and smell the coffee' moment in the opening battle of the 14-game World Chess Championship match in Singapore on Monday.The world No. 23 Chinese, who had accepted that he was an underdog, won in 42 moves of French defense Steinitz variation against an opponent who is world No. 5 and in red-hot form.It was a nervy contest, rich in nuances and high on spirit. For almost five hours, the followers were glued to their gadgets and apparently so was Ding, supposedly recovering from mental cobwebs. In the process, it was Gukesh's turn to get trapped.The winless run of 300-plus days didn't stop Ding from scoring his third career classical win against Gukesh - and all of them have come with black pieces. Gukesh is yet to score a classical win against the Asian giant and if he wants to avoid tiebreaks of shorter time controls, he has to win at least twice now to seal the deal. Gukesh did not make any dramatic mistakes or blunders; but there were oversights. Ding was more accurate and alert and raised the bar with good moves that his younger opponent didn't envisage at clutch moments.Once a regular opening, the French defense became extremely rare at the World Championship level since the 1978 Match onwards. And Ding last tried it against Nepo last year in the seventh game, also with black, and lost it. But this specific line - Classical Steinitz variation (named after the first ever world champion) was the first occurrence at this stage.Only one pawn and a knight were off the board till the 25th move as the players tried to wrest control. Though Ding castled late (31st move), his two knight moves (18..Nb2 and 32..Nd3) had precision written all over. Ding acknowledged it was a great win, but he was lucky too. ""I was worse out of the opening but overall, I played well. I thought he (Gukesh) might get nervous at the start of the match and hence I tried to play something unusual that I have not tried recently. And it worked to perfection.""Gukesh accepted that it's not a great start in his bid to become the youngest monarch of the sport. ""All depended on alertness,"" he said at the press conference later. ""I made a tactical oversight (GM and commentator Judit Polgar thought the mistakes were strategic). It can happen. I expected nothing else but the best version of Ding. Now, it gets more exciting since I am trailing.""Saying that he was playing on his own (out of the book) after Ding's 10th move that led to his first long thought, with stretched for almost 21 minutes, the Indian emphasised that his gameplan for the remaining contest won't change much. He intends to play with good energy and according to the positions and not be ultra-defensive.For the first 10 moves, Gukesh took just 90 seconds and Ding almost 50 minutes - the pawn move needing 28 minutes and a queen-push a further 15. But 12 moves later, Ding had the clock advantage (29 mins in hand for 28 moves to Gukesh's 24). And finally, it led to Gukesh needing to make seven moves in 45 seconds to reach the 40-move mark.1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nce2 Nc6 7.c3 a5 8.Nf3 a4 9.Be3 Be7 10.g4 Qa5 11.Bg2 a3 12.b3 cxd4 13.b4 Qc7 14.Nexd4 Nb6 15.0-0 Nc4 16.Bf2 Bd7 17.Qe2 Nxd4 18.Nxd4 Nb2 19.Qe3 Rc8 20.Rac1 Qc4 21.f5 Qd3 22.Qe1 Bg5 23.Rc2 Rc4 24.h4 Bf4 25.Qb1 Rxc3 26.Rxc3 Qxc3 27.fxe6 fxe6 28.Ne2 Qxe5 29.Nxf4 Qxf4 30.Qc2 Qc4 31.Qd2 0-0 32.Bd4 Nd3 33.Qe3 Rxf1+ 34.Bxf1 e5 35.Bxe5 Qxg4+ 36.Bg2 Bf5 37.Bg3 Be4 38.Kh2 h6 39.Bh3 Qd1 40.Bd6 Qc2+ 41.Kg3 Qxa2 42.Be6+ Kh8 white resigned.","Reigning world champion Ding Liren gave the 18-year-old Indian challenger a 'wake up and smell the coffee' moment in the opening battle of the 14-game World Chess Championship match in Singapore on Monday.

NEW DELHI: The two-day Indian Premier League (IPL) auction concluded in the port city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia on November 25, with Rishabh Pant emerging as the costliest buy, breaking the record of biggest price tag with a pay-cheque of a staggering Rs 27 crore from the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).Batter Shreyas Iyer came a close second with a bid of Rs 26.75 crore, shelled out by the Punjab Kings.Rishabh Pant, who was not retained by Delhi Capitals (DC) and is currently playing the Test series in Australia, was bought by the LSG after an intense bidding war with Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Delhi -- taking his base-price of Rs 2 crore to a record rise. It will be the first time that Pant will move out of his hometown Delhi to play for another IPL side, and it required LSG to empty their pockets, breaking the record set by Australian pacer Mitchell Starc last year with his Rs 24.75 crore bid from Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). In all likelihood, Pant will lead the LSG side, especially because KL Rahul is no longer with the Lucknow team.Shreyas Iyer took home a whopping Rs 26.75 crore pay-cheque from Punjab. Released by KKR ahead of the auction, Iyer had led the franchise to their third IPL title in 2024, after missing the entire 2023 season due to a back injury. However, he was still not retained by Kolkata. The 29-year-old was originally bought by KKR for Rs 12.25 crore in 2022, taking on the role of captain following seven seasons with Delhi Capitals. Punjab, who were also looking for a marquee player to lead the side, might appoint him as their skipper for the 2025 season.Venkatesh Iyer turned out to be a surprise star at the IPL 2025 mega auction, with reigning champions KKR splashing a massive Rs 23.75 crore to bring him back into the fold. The left-handed Iyer was not retained by KKR ahead of the auction. Iyer entered the auction with a base price of Rs 2 crore, with KKR making the first move for the star performer of their title-winning run in the last edition and eventually winning the bid after an intense battle with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB).England white-ball captain Jos Buttler laughed his way to the bank as he raked in a jaw-dropping Rs 15.75 crore from 2022 champions Gujarat Titans (GT). After an intense three-way bidding war, GT secured the services of the England superstar for a whopping price. Buttler, who was not retained by Rajasthan Royals ahead of the auction, was part of the franchise for the last seven editions. Before joining Royals in 2018, Buttler had represented Mumbai Indians in 2016 and 2017 editions. Buttler also brings with him valuable experience and leadership qualities.KL Rahul was part of the marquee list at the auction and had a base price of Rs. 2 crore. He had entered the IPL auction after not being retained by LSG despite being their captain last season. Rahul has been a vital asset for multiple franchises over the years, including the Lucknow, Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings), Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Sunrisers Hyderabad. With Pant no longer with DC, Rahul is the most likely candidate to lead the Delhi team in the 2025 season.Rajasthan Royals (RR) snapped up England pacer Jofra Archer for Rs 12.50 crore. The Royals, known for their strategic picks, brought back Archer, adding a world-class bowler to their roster. Archer, who played his last IPL season in 2020, was added back to the shortlist three days before the auction. The right-arm pacer made his comeback this summer after a lengthy injury layoff, featuring in England's white-ball series against Pakistan, Australia and the West Indies, as well as the T20 World Cup.MI bagged veteran New Zealand pacer Trent Boult, known for his early strikes with the new ball, for Rs 12.50 crore. The move will reunite the Kiwi left-arm pacer, who took 16 wickets in last IPL season but was still released by Rajasthan, will reunite with India’s ace fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah at MI. The pair was instrumental in Mumbai's title-winning campaign in 2020. It was their fifth and last crown. Overall, Boult has represented as many as five teams: Sunrisers Hyderabad, Kolkata Knight Riders, Delhi Capitals, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals in the cash-rich league.Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) has successfully re-acquired the Australian right-arm pacer Josh Hazlewood for Rs 12.5 crore. Having previously contributed to RCB's impressive 2021 season, Hazlewood is set to lead their pace attack once again. His proven skills in generating bounce and movement will significantly enhance RCB's fast-bowling department.Ishan Kishan will be turning up for a new franchise in the IPL as the youngster was sold to SRH for Rs 11.25 crore, which is 26% less than Rs 15.25 crore MI paid to buy him in the 2022 auction. Mumbai started the bidding for Kishan at his pace price of Rs 2 crore but didn't go beyond Rs 3.20 crore. Delhi Capitals, looking for a wicketkeeper-batter after Rishabh Pant wasn't retained, were in an intense bidding war with Punjab Kings before SRH joined the action late and got his services.Chennai Super Kings secured Afghanistan's young talent Noor Ahmad for Rs 10 crore after a fierce bidding contest ensued between Mumbai Indians and Chennai for the left-arm Afghanistan spinner's services. Initially acquired by CSK for Rs 5 crore, Ahmad's price doubled when GT's attempt to get him with the 'Right to Match' card was thwarted by CSK's elevated bid of Rs 10 crore. Chennai's acquisition of Ravichandran Ashwin, the retention of Ravindra Jadeja from IPL 2024 and the addition of Ahmad has established a formidable spin-bowling unit that appears well-suited to their home-ground conditions.","Indian Premier League (IPL) auction concluded in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia on November 25. Rishabh Pant broke the record of biggest price tag with a pay- cheque of a staggering Rs 27 crore from the Lucknow Super Giants. Shreyas Iyer came a close second with a bid of Rs 26.75 crore, shelled out by the Punjab Kings.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115684676,imgsize-63190,width-400,resizemode-4/115684676.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Having retained the core of their team for 2025 and beyond, Chennai Super Kings brought back R Ashwin after 10 seasons at the IPL Auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and reunited him with Ravindra Jadeja. They also bolstered their spin attack and created backup in the form of Noor Ahmed.The five-time IPL champions also signed players who have the experience in domestic cricket but their IPL careers haven't created headlines in the years gone by. That list includes Rahul Tripathi, Vijay Shankar, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Deepak Hooda and Shreyas Gopal.Out of the total purse of Rs 120 crore, which each franchise had before retaining players, CSK spent Rs 65 crore to retain five players, including the uncapped MS Dhoni (Rs 4 crore).The re-introduction of a rule in the IPL Player Regulations allowed CSK to retain Dhoni. The rule states that any player who hasn't played international cricket for five years or hasn't had a central contract for that period is considered uncapped.1. Moeen Ali2. Deepak Chahar3.

NEW DELHI: Star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant on Sunday made history at the IPL 2025 mega auction in Jeddah, becoming the league’s most expensive player with a record-breaking Rs 27 crore bid from Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).Pant edged past Shreyas Iyer, who fetched Rs 26.75 crore from Punjab Kings, as teams went all out for marquee Indian stars.Both Pant and Iyer entered the auction after parting ways with their previous teams. Iyer, who led Kolkata Knight Riders to the IPL title earlier this year, briefly held the record as the costliest IPL player before LSG swooped in for Pant. Delhi Capitals used their Right to Match (RTM) card for Pant at Rs 20.75 crore but opted not to match LSG's staggering bid.Former DC teammates Iyer and Pant have had to deal with adversity in the past couple of years but have shown remarkable resilience and courage to bounce back.Iyer is expected to captain Punjab Kings, while Pant is likely to lead LSG in the upcoming season. Among other big buys, leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal attracted Rs 18 crore from Punjab Kings, while former LSG skipper KL Rahul was picked up by Delhi Capitals for Rs 14 crore.Sunrisers Hyderabad secured India pacer Mohammed Shami for Rs 10 crore, while left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh earned Rs 18 crore through Punjab’s RTM card.South African speedster Kagiso Rabada went to Gujarat Titans for Rs 10.75 crore, highlighting an auction filled with record-breaking bids and tactical moves.","Rishabh Pant becomes most expensive IPL player after he goes to LSG for Rs 27 crore. Shreyas Iyer, Venkatesh Iyer fetch Rs 26.75 crore each at IPL mega auction.

Rishabh Pant became the most expensive player at IPL 2025 Auction and in the history of the league after the flashy left-handed wicketkeeper-batter was taken by Lucknow Super Giants for Rs 27 crore. Pant became LSG's obvious choice as team leader as they broke bank for his credentials.Shreyas Iyer had become the most expensive IPL player for a brief period when Punjab Kings spent Rs 26.75 crore on him. He had played his cricket for defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders last season and led them to the title.Another notable signing over the two-day IPL Auction was that of 13-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi. From a base price of Rs 30 lakh, the teenager went to Rajasthan Royals for Rs 1.10 crore in a deal that captured the attention of many.Out of the national team setup for over two years, Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s experience found high demand among IPL franchises, with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) securing his services for Rs 10.75 crore on Monday.The second day of the mega auction turned out to be lucrative for several Indian pacers, while some big names, including Shardul Thakur, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, Kane Williamson, and Glenn Phillips, went unsold.Set to turn 35 before the start of the next IPL season, Bhuvneshwar boasts an impressive record of 300 wickets in 287 T20 matches with an economy rate under eight.Other notable deals included Deepak Chahar, who fetched Rs 9.25 crore from Mumbai Indians despite his injury history, and Mukesh Kumar, retained by Delhi Capitals for Rs 8 crore through the RTM card. Lucknow Super Giants also invested heavily, signing Test pacer Akash Deep for Rs 8 crore.Among the all-rounders, Krunal Pandya earned Rs 5.75 crore from RCB, who were in need of an experienced spin-bowling all-rounder. Rajasthan Royals made significant bids for Tushar Deshpande (Rs 6.50 crore) and Nitish Rana (Rs 4.20 crore), while Delhi Capitals secured former RCB skipper Faf du Plessis at a bargain base price of Rs 2 crore. Gujarat Titans acquired Washington Sundar for Rs 3.20 crore in another smart move.The scarcity of quality Indian seam-bowling all-rounders worked in favor of South Africa’s Marco Jansen, who secured a Rs 7 crore deal with Punjab Kings. Also making a major gain was veteran New Zealand pacer Trent Boult who was bought by Mumbai Indians for Rs 12.5 crore -- highlighting the demand for quality fast bowlers.Meanwhile, the auction reflected the high demand for Indian talent despite the limited options, ensuring lucrative deals for even fringe players.On Sunday, the first day of the auction, most of the high-profile names raked in the moolah as the franchises virtually emptied their pockets to bag the priority players in their respective shortlist.Led by Rs 27 crore Lucknow Super Giants spent to buy star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, the sum of money splurged by the franchises came to a whopping INR 467.95 crore.Pant edged past Shreyas Iyer, who fetched Rs 26.75 crore from Punjab Kings, as teams went all out for marquee Indian stars. Venkatesh Iyer took home a whopping Rs 23.75 crore from KKR.A total of 84 players from the roster of 577 were presented on the opening day at the Abadi Al Johar Arena. Out of these 68 got sold, while four were retained through the Right-to-Match card.Among other big buys, leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal attracted Rs 18 crore from Punjab Kings, who also used the Right-to-Match card to bring back paceman Arshdeep Singh for Rs 18 crore. KL Rahul was picked up by Delhi Capitals for Rs 14 crore.The IPL 2025 auction held in Jeddah saw some surprising exclusions, with several renowned players remaining unsold. Leading the list is David Warner, the former Australia opener and Sunrisers Hyderabad’s 2016 title-winning captain. At 38 and post-retirement from international cricket, Warner failed to attract any bids. Similarly, seasoned players like New Zealand's Kane Williamson, England’s Jonny Bairstow, and India’s Shardul Thakur and Umesh Yadav also went unsold, despite their proven track records.The quality of the unsold players is so strong that a hypothetical ""Unsold XI"" could challenge any of the ten IPL teams. This lineup, captained by Kane Williamson, includes big names like Prithvi Shaw, Sikandar Raza, and Chetan Sakariya, among others.Meanwhile, the BCCI has announced IPL schedules for the next three seasons. The 2025 edition will be held from March 14 to May 25, with future seasons similarly structured.Meanwhile, the BCCI has taken a significant step by announcing the schedules for the IPL for the next three seasons. This is a departure from the usual practice of releasing schedules closer to the tournament.The 2025 IPL will commence on March 14 and conclude on May 25.The IPL Auction 2025 showcased a dramatic and competitive bidding war, with several franchises securing high-profile talent to strengthen their squads for the upcoming season. The second day saw Indian pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar topping the chart with a hefty price of INR 10.75 crore, reflecting the high demand for experienced fast bowlers despite his long absence from the national team. This influx of Indian talent demonstrates how IPL franchises value local players, often resulting in hefty bids even for those not part of the national setup.Franchises made smart moves by picking up key players based on specific team needs. Deepak Chahar, for example, fetched Rs 9.25 crore despite a history of injuries, highlighting the increasing reliance on proven seamers. Meanwhile, Mumbai Indians, who often make shrewd investments, secured both Mukesh Chahar and Deepak Chahar, bolstering their pace attack for IPL 2025. Lucknow Super Giants also impressed with strategic buys like Akash Deep, further reinforcing their depth in bowling.Notably, there was also a surge in the prices of all-rounders like Krunal Pandya (Rs 5.75 crore) and Washington Sundar (Rs 3.20 crore), whose versatility adds immense value to their respective teams. This indicates that franchises are looking for players who can contribute with both bat and ball, especially in the high-pressure, multifaceted environment of the IPL.The auction was also marked by some surprising omissions. Players like Shardul Thakur, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, and Kane Williamson, who are usually regarded as top performers, went unsold, pointing to the shifting dynamics of IPL team strategies. While these players' exclusion may have shocked fans, it underlined the intense competition for spots and the changing nature of what franchises are looking for in their squads.Overall, the 2025 auction was a testament to the evolving nature of IPL strategies—teams focused on a mix of experience, youth, and flexibility. As the season nears, fans can look forward to an exciting and unpredictable tournament, with new combinations and fresh talent ready to light up the IPL stage.","Bhuvneshwar Kumar, out of India's national team for two years, fetched a hefty Rs 10.75 crore from RCB in the IPL 2025 auction.

'Yashasvi Jaiswal ne aisa kya kiya...': Former coach explains why Prithvi Shaw went unsold at IPL Auction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/yashasvi-jaiswal-ne-aisa-kya-kiya-former-coach-explains-why-prithvi-shaw-went-unsold-at-ipl-auction/articleshow/115749806.cms,"Prithvi Shaw, base price Rs 75 lakh, failed to attract a bid at IPL 2025 mega auction

NEW DELHI: Prithvi Shaw faced a major setback at the IPL 2025 mega auction as the opening batter went unsold, with no franchises showing interest in acquiring him.Shaw's struggles with form and fitness have significantly impacted his value, leading to his exclusion from the bidding process.This development marks a significant blow to Shaw's efforts to reignite his career, especially after being released by Delhi Capitals ahead of the auction. With this disappointment, questions loom over Shaw's future in both the IPL and international cricket.In a podcast, Shaw's former coach Jwala Singh explained the reason for the batter's downfall and why he remained unsold at the IPL auction in Jeddah.On being asked by the host that why Shaw disappeared from the scene even though he was extremely talented, Jwala Singh said, ""Prithvi came to me in 2015 and was with me for three years. And when he came he had not played Mumbai Under-16 matches and his father asked me to guide him. Then in next year, he played the Under-19 Cooch Behar Trophy and scored big in selection matches. And I worked very hard on him. Basically he was talented from the beginning, I will not take full credit because many coaches have worked for him, but at that time it was only me. I was excited when he played the Under-19 World Cup because he was my first student to do so. Before leaving for the Under-19 World Cup, he had celebrated his birthday with me. But after that I have not seen him, that was 2017, we are in 2024, I have not seen him, he has not come to me.""On being again asked by the host that when Shaw was emerging on the scene he was compared to legends like Brian Lara Sachin Tendulkar , he made a hundred on Test and then started his problems with the incoming delivery and that grew so much that there are questions raised about his weight, confidence, attitude, so what has Yashasvi Jaiswal done that Shaw couldn't do because both were equally talented?Jwala Singh, who was also the coach of Yashasvi Jaiswal, replies, ""I think the process, which we call work ethic, so I feel if you are talented, talent is just a seed, to make it a tree, consistency is very important in that journey and that consistency comes from your lifestyle, your work ethic and discipline, so what I feel is that consistency is not with him. One can make great start which he did but to stay at the top in international cricket, one has to improve his game all the time. Even Sachin Tendulkar refined his game consistently, fine-tuned his game, worked on his fitness and mental toughness. So I feel a player goes off track only if he gets away from the process. You will not fall back if your process and work ethic is fine, so I feel players fail because of that. As far as Yashasvi is concerned, is work ethic is superb, he really works hard and he knows what to do. That is the main difference.""Following disappointing performances in the first two rounds of the 2024 Ranji Trophy, Shaw was dropped from Mumbai's squad for the third round.Reports indicate that the decision was influenced not just by his poor form but also by disciplinary concerns, including missed training sessions, adding to his struggles.Shaw's journey has been a rollercoaster of highs and lows. In 2018, he was named by the ICC as one of the top five breakout stars in men's cricket, showcasing immense potential.However, his career hit a stumbling block in 2019 when he received a doping ban from the BCCI, ruling him out of action until November that year.",Prithvi Shaw failed to attract a bid at IPL 2025 mega auction in Jeddah. Delhi Capitals released Shaw ahead of the auction. Questions loom over Shaw's future in both the IPL and international cricket.

Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Wasim Akram explains why Jasprit Bumrah is a terror with the ball,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/watch-wasim-akram-explains-why-jasprit-bumrah-is-a-terror-with-the-ball/articleshow/115751351.cms,"Jasprit Bumrah compared to Indian great Kapil Dev

NEW DELHI: Arguably the greatest fast bowler in the history of cricket, Wasim Akram 's influence extends beyond his records.The former Pakistani cricketer and captain has inspired generations of fast bowlers globally, especially in Pakistan, where his reverse swing mastery set a template for many bowlers.After retiring as one of the greats of the game, Akram is working as a commentator, cricket analyst, and nowadays is commentating on the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the Test series between India and Australia.Star Sports, the official broadcaster of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in India, shared a video of Akram decoding the bowling of Jasprit Bumrah , who led India to an emphatic victory in the first Test in Perth.Explaining his wrist action and skidding of the ball, Akram says, ""Bumrah's bowling arm comes from behind (the shoulder) the hyper-extension and in the end as we say in Punjabi ""tunka"" flick of the wrist that makes the ball skid which as a batsman you don't expect specially on the wickets where the ball is keeping low, he has troubled the batsmen of that action which is natural and it is very tough to flick the wrist in the end.""India defeated Australia by 295 runs to take a 1-0 lead in the five-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy as stand-in captain Bumrah returned with outstanding match spell of 8/72.Bumrah almost defies the laws of physics with his ability to release the ball about 34 cms ahead of the popping crease, when most bowlers release it within 10 cms ahead of the line. These extra 24 cms that Bumrah gets from his release point makes him a terror as he gets the ball to hurry on to the batter like nobody else.Akram adds, ""The release point of Bumrah's delivery also differs by almost 40 cms and that makes a quite a big difference at this pace and that's why his deliveries skid after pitching.""Bumrah is not a natural athlete, but it is his ability to surpass the obstacles that has made him the match-winner that he is.",Wasim Akram is commentating on the Border-Gavaskar Trophy between India and Australia. Star Sports shared a video of Akram decoding the bowling of Jasprit Bumrah. India defeated Australia by 295 runs to take a 1-0 lead in the five- match series.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115751340,imgsize-56060,width-400,resizemode-4/115751340.jpg"

Liverpool vs Real Madrid kick-off time

Real Madrid's key attacking player for their Champions League match against Liverpool on Wednesday will be Kylian Mbappe , due to Vinicius Junior's injury.Real Madrid will face Liverpool at Anfield on Thursday in a crucial Champions League match, but they will be without Vinicius Junior. In addition to Junior's absence, Real Madrid has struggled in the tournament, losing two out of four games and currently sitting in 21st place.The French captain has had a difficult start in the Spanish capital, both on and off the field. However, he finally scored his first goal in five matches during Sunday's La Liga game against Leganes.Coach Carlo Ancelotti started Mbappe in his preferred left-wing position, and Mbappe rewarded him by scoring the opening goal at Butarque.It's worth noting that Vinicius created the scoring opportunity for Mbappe. With the Brazilian player sidelined for over three weeks, Mbappe will have to take on the responsibility of leading Real Madrid's attack, starting with the game at Anfield.Liverpool currently leads the Champions League group, while defending champions Real Madrid are in 18th place after surprising defeats to Lille and AC Milan in their first four matches.In those four matches, Vinicius scored four Champions League goals, while Mbappe has only scored once in the European competition.Mbappe has scored seven goals in 12 La Liga appearances, which isn't a poor record. However, given his superstar status, his overall performances have been somewhat underwhelming.The French forward, who was left out of his national team's squad for the last two international breaks, believes he is gradually finding his form.Real Madrid will be looking to improve their standing in the Champions League group table. Liverpool, on the other hand, will aim to maintain their lead.Sony Sports Network is the official broadcaster of the UEFA Champions League in India. The highly anticipated clash between Liverpool and Real Madrid will be telecast live on Sony Sports Ten 2 and Sony Sports Ten 3 channels, available in both SD and HD formats.Liverpool vs Real Madrid match will take place at Anfield and is scheduled to kick off on Thursday, November 28, at 1:30 AM IST.","Real Madrid will be without Vinicius Junior for their Champions League match against Liverpool.

(Photo by James Worsfold/Getty Images)

Ignored by Delhi cricket in junior cricket, pacer turned to Bhandari to learn art of fast bowling; shed weight to make grade

Where will KL Rahul bat when Rohit Sharma returns to Playing XI for Adelaide Test

Harshit Rana 's inclusion in India's squad for the Australia sojourn was not without controversy. There was debate whether he was being fast-tracked into the Test team, that too on such a high-profile tour. A Test match in Perth later, Rana's emergence as a credible pace option must have calmed a few nerves in the Indian dressing room.Rana isn't new to selection debates. For all the promise he showed at an early age, Delhi cricket mostly felt he wasn't good enough to play for the state side. In fact, he made his IPL debut for Kolkata Knight Riders in April 2022, seven months before he made his debut for the Delhi senior team. There were a couple of rejections at the U-19 level as well.It was just before the second Covid-19 wave in 2021 - after being overlooked at the U-19 level in the state - that Rana went to former India pacer Amit Bhandari to find answers.""Harshit played all his cricket in Rohtak Road but one day he came to Gyan Bharti School in south Delhi. I was there, since my son trained there. He walked up to me and said, please teach me the art of fast bowling,"" Bhandari told TOI.Bhandari claims the desire to learn was unmistakable in him. Since fast bowling came naturally to him, they started focusing on game sense rather than technique.""He has a strong upper body which is not built in a gym. His upright seam position came naturally to him. He is someone who will not get injured because of his action. We ignored all discussion about his action. He is not express fast but bowls a heavy ball. He will bowl consistently above 135 kmph but can touch 140 and more when he is in rhythm. We started working on bowling areas in different situation of a game. We did single-stump bowling with new and old ball. He was curious about setting up a batter with an old ball. There were a lot of discussions on how a ball behaves in different conditions in various situation of a game,"" said Bhandari.""What stood out for me was that he was willing to go through any amount of workload. He had the discipline to turn up in whites when we practiced with the red ball. One has to have the complete feel of what he is practising for. From there, he went to Gujarat Titans as a net bowler. He is so eager to be in such a rich environment that he started working very hard,"" Bhandari stated before adding: ""He may have struggled in the second innings in Perth but let me tell you he will not want let go of the Indian dressing room. He will work harder to learn how to bowl in tough situations.""Former India selector Devang Gandhi , who coached Rana in the Delhi team last year, pointed out the clarity in his mind.""Harshit was with us just for the white-ball season since he was picked for India 'A' before getting injured. I had very little discussion with him because he knew what he wanted to do. I told him he needed to shed a few more kgs to be sharper and he assured me that he will do that. By the time IPL 2024 came, he was leaner and bowling quick at above 140 kmph,"" Gandhi told TOI.It's his willingness to plough through adversities that has seen Harshit rise rapidly through the ranks. Gandhi reckons with a few more games under the belt, he will be a complete bowler.",Harshit Rana made his Test debut for India against Australia in Perth. Former India bowler Amit Bhandari says Rana turned to him to learn the art of fast bowling. Rana was overlooked by Delhi cricket in junior cricket. He made his IPL debut for Kolkata Knight Riders in 2022.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115753159,imgsize-84598,width-400,resizemode-4/115753159.jpg"

Other winners of the evening included Borussia Dortmund, last season's runners-up.Real Madrid tried to extend their winning streak against Liverpool to eight games at Anfield.Alexis MacAllister gave Arne Slot's Premier League leaders the lead early in the second half, but they were too powerful.After an hour, Kylian Mbappe wasted a chance to equalize for Madrid after his penalty was saved, capping a disappointing evening.On minute 76, Liverpool's second goal was headed in by substitute Cody Gakpo after Mohamed Salah missed from the penalty spot at the opposite end.They are the only team in this redesigned Champions League with five straight victories, and they are now assured of making it at least to the February knockout stage play-offs.""You know how special it is to play against a club that won this Champions League so many times, are the reigning champions and were a pain in the ass for Liverpool many times as well,"" said Slot.Real Madrid is now in 24th place, the final qualifying berth for the knockout stage, with six points after losing three of their last five games.Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti had words of comfort for their star French striker, saying: ""This is a difficult moment for Mbappe. We will support him and give him love.""With a 3-0 victory over Dinamo Zagreb in Croatia, Inter Milan is in second place with 13 points, ahead of Barcelona and Dortmund with 12 each.Dortmund took the lead thanks to a fantastic goal from English teenager Jamie Gittens in the first half.

'Bindaas khelne ka': How Suryakumar Yadav's pep talk helped Urvil Patel create history,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/exclusive-bindaas-khelne-ka-how-suryakumar-yadavs-pep-talk-helped-urvil-patel-create-history/articleshow/115737416.cms,"Urvil Patel and Suryakumar Yadav

NEW DELHI: November 27 holds immense significance for Gujarat's young wicketkeeper-batter Urvil Patel . On this day in 2023, just a day after being released by the Gujarat Titans , Urvil smashed an unbeaten 41-ball 100 for Gujarat in a Vijay Hazare Trophy match against Arunachal Pradesh in Chandigarh. That century became the second-fastest by an Indian batter in List A cricket.Exactly a year later, Urvil achieved another remarkable feat, this time in the shortest format.Urvil on Wednesday blasted a 28-ball century in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy against Tripura in Indore. The whirlwind knock is now the second-fastest century in T20 cricket overall and the fastest by an Indian.The 26-year-old’s extraordinary effort -- 35-ball 113, featuring seven fours and 12 sixes -- comes a couple of days after going unsold in the IPL 2025 auction.Despite not being picked by any franchise, Urvil remains undeterred and is focused on his game.""I did expect an IPL deal, to be very honest. But I am happy that I am playing, performing, and taking my game forward. I was watching the auction, but I simply got up and immediately shifted my focus towards my game after not being picked by any franchise. I am not disappointed. This is something not in my hands,"" Urvil told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.""I just went normally and tried to play my natural game. When I saw some loose deliveries coming, I started hammering them. I got pumped up when the ball was coming right onto the bat. I was enjoying it, and then I went into brutal mode,"" added Urvil, who has represented Gujarat in six first-class and 14 List A matches.The record for the fastest T20 century still belongs to Estonia’s Sahil Chauhan, who achieved it off 27 balls against Cyprus in June 2024.Among Indians, Rishabh Pant held the previous record -- a 32-ball century for Delhi against Himachal Pradesh during the 2018 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.Hailing from Kahipur village in Mehsana in Gujarat, Urvil was part of Gujarat Titans in the IPL 2023 season.Bought for Rs 20 lakh, Urvil shared the dressing room with stalwarts like Hardik Pandya, Shubman Gill, David Miller, Kane Williamson and Matthew Wade. The experience at Titans helped him hone his power-hitting skills.Urvil draws inspiration from Suryakumar Yadav and tries to emulate the Indian T20I captain’s dynamic approach in white-ball cricket.""I met Surya bhai during the IPL. I went up to him and straight-up told him that I admire him. He was very happy. He put his hand around my shoulder and said, 'Chal, baat karte hain.' [Let's go and talk]. He gave me a lot of batting tips. He said, 'Bindaas khelne ka. Ball ko dekhna, but pehle bowler ko, uske action ko, uske hand aur finger movement ko. And be confident. Apne aap ko hamesha back karna' [Play fearlessly. Focus on the ball, but first observe the bowler—watch their action, their hand, and finger movements. And be confident. Always back yourself],"" Urvil shared, recalling his interaction with SKY.""I always recall his words whenever I go to the middle. We both bat with the same approach, and it doesn't matter who the bowler is,"" Urvil said.The Gujarat batter also credits Hardik for his guidance.""I have learned from Hardik bhai as well. He is very cool and down-to-earth. You can approach him at any point in time and ask him anything. He is always there to help. I like his aggressive approach.

Where will KL Rahul bat when Rohit Sharma returns to Playing XI for Adelaide Test

NEW DELHI: Former India batting icon Sunil Gavaskar drew a comparison between the period when tennis greats Roger Federer Rafael Nadal , and Novak Djokovic were without titles with Virat Kohli 's struggles before the former captain struck a magnificent hundred in the first Test in Perth in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .""I said in commentary that Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, and Rafa Nadal, they are title winners. If they lose in the semi-finals, people say, 'Oh, they're not in form.' Anybody else getting into the semi-finals, you would say, 'Oh, what a wonderful performance.'""Similarly, with Virat Kohli, because everybody is so used to him scoring so many hundreds quite regularly, when he doesn't score 100, even if he's getting 70-80 -- which a lot of guys will be very happy to get -- people say, 'Look, he's not scoring runs.' And that is the reason why there was that feeling.""But then again, Indian fans, they're greedy fans. They're not going to be happy with their idol scoring only 60-70s. They want their icons, their idols, to score hundreds, and that is the reason there was this little talk about, 'Oh, he hasn't got a hundred since July 2023.' July 2023 is just about a year ago,"" Gavaskar said on Star Sports.Kohli neutralized the Australian assault and regained his former form in the second innings of the Perth Test thanks to a minor change in batting stance, according to Gavaskar.Following a poor run of form in all formats in recent months, Kohli traveled to Australia. His inability to control spin on turning tracks cast doubt on his team position.But in the first Test at Perth, he hushed his critics by scoring his 30th Test ton. After the 121 he scored against the West Indies at Port of Spain in July 2023, this was his first century.""His body was completely relaxed when he came into bat in the second innings. In the first innings, because of the fact that India had lost two wickets early, he would have also been under pressure,"" Gavaskar added.""In that second innings, you could sense apart from changing that stance, I think he also got his legs, which were maybe just a little bit wider at the start. Just a little bit, maybe I'm thinking too much, but that little thing might have given him that height he wanted. Well, in Australia, on the bouncier pitches, you need that edge.""I liked that mid-wicket boundary that he hit off Hazlewood. That, to me, was not the easiest of shots. A straight drive is a little easier because your stance is like that, but just to open up a little bit and play that - that was all magic.""In the second essay, when Australian bowlers desperately tried the off-stump line, short ball tactic, and even attacking the line of stump to get the seasoned batter out after he was dismissed on five in the first innings, Kohli used all of his technical skills to deal with the whims of variable bounce.In his comments on Kohli 's stance changes in the second innings, former Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden said that Kohli was successful in being more upright on a ground with varying bounce.""It's a very good point because the reverse can be said also to someone touring to India and having to lower their stance. I know I certainly did that. But being able to be a little more upright means that your head position has to stay on top of the bounce so that it starts to work in your favour.""I said right from the start that I actually liked his move, batting in more line with the ball. I thought that was a good strategy. I think he loves to play like that, and we saw some classic cases where he just eased the ball through mid-wicket. But you can't do that from outside off stump, so getting into the line, I thought, was important.""""The other little adjustment that you mentioned, being a little more upright, so he could stay on top of the bounce, was also really important. If you're getting closer to the ball like he was -- another thing, I think, was probably playing the ball later.""When he's not in his best form, he goes quite hard, feeling for the ball. He wants to feel the ball on the bat, particularly on the front foot. But he just seemed to give himself a little more time and be a little softer.""",Sunil Gavaskar compares Virat Kohli's struggles with tennis greats Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.

Yashasvi Jaiswal and Jasprit Bumrah stole the show in India's Perth win

NEW DELHI: Australian batter Travis Head has dismissed claims of a rift within the Test team following comments made by fast bowler Josh Hazlewood , which sparked speculation about a potential divide in the dressing room.Hazlewood addressed the media after day three of the match and was questioned about Australia's approach to day four, given their daunting position at 3-12, chasing an improbable target of 534. His remarks were interpreted by some as hinting at a split within the side, prompting rumours of discord.Responding to a query, Hazlewood stated that he's looking forward to the second Test rather than stressing about the current situation.“You probably have to ask one of the batters that question. I’m sort of relaxing and trying to get a bit of physio and a bit of treatment, and I’m probably looking mostly towards the next Test and what plans we can do against these batters,"" Hazlewood told mediapersons on Day 3.""That to me tells me there is potentially a divided change room. I don’t know if there is. I might be reading too much into that,"" reacted Adam Gilchrist on the situation.Former England captain Michael Vaughan said he was “staggered” by Hazlewood’s comments.""Publicly, I’ve never heard an Australian come out and divide the camp as batters and bowlers,” Vaughan told Fox Cricket.However, reacting to the matter, Head quashed such speculations, emphasising the unity and camaraderie within the Australian camp despite the challenging circumstances.""I think (people have) picked the bones out of a comment on the back of a poor week, which is fine. All the boys hung out together last night, nothing changed in the way we were as a group,"" Head told 7NEWS.""We stuck together, had some good conversations as we always would, win or draw. It’s a pretty level group. No doubt there was a lot of disappointment around the room but definitely no fractions,"" he added.After Hazlewood's comments, Australian skipper Pat Cummins has emphatically denied any split within the team's dressing room.""It’s a really tight unit. It’s probably one of the tightest teams I’ve ever played with. We really enjoy playing cricket together,"" Cummins said.","Travis Head has dismissed claims of a rift within the Australian Test team.

LUCKNOW: Lucknow girl Chandani Sharma , daughter of a barber, on Wednesday secured a spot in the India 'A' Under-19 team for the triangular series featuring India 'B' Under-19 team and South Africa. Four other girls from Uttar Pradesh — Supriya Arela (Agra), Bharti Upadhyay (Aligarh), Sonam Yadav (Firozabad), and Parshvi Chopra (Gautam Budh Nagar) — were selected for the India 'B' team.The Indian team for the under-19 cricket world cup would be selected after this series.Chandani Sharma (18), hailing from the busy bylanes of Bangla Bazar in the state capital, showed a natural inclination towards cricket from the age of five, playing enthusiastically in the streets and at home. As she grew older, her passion for cricket intensified, often at the expense of her studies. When she was in class 8, she told her family she wanted to pursue cricket full-time and leave her studies. Her brother advised her to at least complete class 10 to meet the requirements for cricket admissions. Following his advice, after her Class 10 board examination, she rushed home and declared that she wouldn't eat until she was allowed to join a cricket academy. Her father eventually enrolled her at the Northern Railway Stadium .Talking to TOI, right-arm leg-break bowler Chandani said, ""I am happy to be part of the Under-19 India 'A' team. This achievement is the result of my family's and my coaches' hard work. My father never held me back despite our financial struggles, even though he couldn't afford my academy fee at first. When he finally took me to the Northern Railway Stadium, he told coaches Priyanka Shaili and Saima Ali that he couldn't pay but wanted me to learn cricket. Since then, I have been playing at the stadium, and my coaches have been a tremendous help. I consider Yuzvendra Chahal my idol and try to emulate his bowling. I also admire Rohit Sharma's batting style.""""The NR stadium is about 10 kilometres from my home, and I commute daily by bicycle, which was gifted to me by my father's friend. I have been training there for the past five years. Coach Saima Ali has worked tirelessly with me, teaching me the nuances of the game that are helping me today. I hope to perform well in the future,"" she saidChandani's brother, Vikas Sharma, said, ""I have three sisters, and I am the only brother. Despite financial hardships, my father ensured we were educated and encouraged my younger sister to pursue cricket. Her passion for cricket is unmatched.""Assistant sports secretary of NR and chairperson of the women's cricket wing in Lucknow, Priyanka Shaili, said, ""Chandani has been training at our ground since the beginning. My colleague, Saima Ali, has groomed her despite her poor family background. I have arranged meals for her and permitted her to stay at the stadium for morning and afternoon practice sessions. Recently, in the Under-19 league matches in Haryana, she claimed 19 wickets in 9 matches, making her the highest wicket-taker in UP. When a child performs like this, selectors cannot ignore them.""","Chandani Sharma (18), hailing from the busy bylanes of Bangla Bazar in the state capital, Lucknow.

Though India player Ishan Kishan remains the biggest grosser among the three Jharkhand cricketers sold at 2025 IPL mega auction in Jeddah, all eyes will be on two other young wicketkeeper-batters from the state – Robin Minz and Kumar Kushagra. Both got richer by Rs. 75 lakh each on Sunday evening, while Kishan moved to Sunrisers Hyderabad from Mumbai Indians with Rs. 11.25cr in his kitty.Getting sold for 'just' Rs. 75 lakh to Mumbai Indians during the 2025 IPL mega auction might look poor compared to what Minz attracted at the 2024 mini auction. The first Adivasi (indigenous) player in IPL history was bought by Gujarat Titans for a whooping Rs 3.6 cr a year ago.However, a freak bike accident ahead of the 2024 season ruled Minz out of any IPL action. As Minz gets ready to take his flamboyance in domestic cricket to the biggest stage in franchise cricket in the upcoming season, there is much more to the price tag.Currently, Minz is busy playing in Syed Muhstaq Ali Trophy with his Jharkhand teammates. So repeated calls to the 22-year-old went unanswered. But his father, Francis Xavier Minz's phone was busy talking to relatives and well-wishers since Sunday evening.Talking to TOI from the Ranchi airport, where the former Army man works as security guard, Xavier said, ""We are incredibly happy that Robin has again got the chance to prove himself at the biggest stage (IPL). Robin had called yesterday right after his deal, he was very happy, too. We are not at all bothered that he has been sold for Rs. 75 lakh this year. Even if he was sold for Rs. 20 or 30 lakh it was okay for us. It is always good to rise after a fall, that brings more happiness and satisfaction.""Pointing at his son's prospect of facing Jasprit Bumrah at the Mumbai Indians nets, Xavier further added, ""MI is a very big team, they have so many big players. Robin will get chance to play, practice alongside the likes of Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah. I think, getting the chance to play Bumrah at the nets for 2-3 months will be the biggest learning experience for Robin this season. He's the best bowler in the world now, so there's lot to learn from him. We just hope Robin gets to play as many matches as possible.""A day after being bought by MI, Minz underscored his credentials as a big-hitting wicketkeeper-batter with a brisk, unbeaten 36 off 12 balls with five fours and two sixes in Jharkhand's 88-run win over Manipur in Mumbai on Monday.",Robin Minz and Kumar Kushagra both got richer by Rs. 75 lakh each on Sunday evening.
