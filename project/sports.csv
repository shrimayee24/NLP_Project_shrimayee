Despite playoff struggles, he’s confident in the team’s potential, especially with new offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer. The rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles remains intense, and Dak Prescott sees progress.Dak Prescott praised the Philadelphia Eagles for earning their championship but emphasized that the Dallas Cowboys are close to matching their level. He acknowledged the Eagles' success while expressing confidence that Dallas can compete with them.""I feel like we compete with the Eagles and beat them for the most part when we play them. I don't want to say check the record when they're the guys holding the trophy right now, so credit to them, they've earned it and they deserve it by all means. But yeah, very close,"" said Prescott.In the 2024 season, the Cowboys were beaten badly by the Eagles in both games, with losses of 34-6 at home and 41-7 away, totaling a 75-13 point difference. Prescott was injured and missed both matchups, so the Cowboys played without their star quarterback.

In his last 20 games, Ball has averaged 12.0 points, 2.6 rebounds, and 3.8 assists per game, showcasing his playmaking ability despite the team’s overall struggles. His absence will likely place additional pressure on Miles Bridges, the team’s leading scorer, who is averaging 20.7 points and 7.6 rebounds over the same stretch.The Hornets’ injury report also includes Moussa Diabate (questionable, eye), Isaiah Wong (probable, foot), and Mark Williams (out, personal). With so many key players sidelined, the Hornets face an uphill battle against the Magic, who are fighting to stay in playoff contention with a 26-29 record.Orlando’s injury situation is less severe, with only two players listed: Moritz Wagner (out for the season, knee) and Jalen Suggs (day-to-day, quadricep). The Magic have relied heavily on Franz Wagner , their leading scorer, who is averaging 25.4 points per game. Despite their offensive struggles, ranking 30th in the league with 104.0 points per game, the Magic boast a strong defense, allowing just 105.8 points per outing, the second-best mark in the NBA.For the Hornets, LaMelo Ball’s absence is a significant blow as they look to salvage what remains of a difficult season. His dynamic playmaking and scoring have been bright spots in an otherwise disappointing campaign. As the team navigates a growing list of injuries, the focus will shift to developing younger players and building for the future.In the meantime, Hornets fans will be eagerly awaiting updates on LaMelo Ball’s recovery timeline.

Did Serena Williams disrespect her sister by performing Cripps walk at Superbowl?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-serena-williams-disrespect-her-sister-by-performing-cripps-walk-at-superbowl/articleshow/118177460.cms,"Serena Williams has sparked controversy after performing the Crip Walk during Kendrick Lamar ’s Super Bowl halftime show , with critics questioning whether she disrespected her late sister, Yetunde Price , who was murdered by a Crip gang member in 2003.Williams, 43, was seen dancing to Lamar’s hit “Not Like Us” during the show, which took place at New Orleans’ Caesars Superdome. Her appearance immediately drew attention, as she executed the signature footwork associated with the Crips, a gang with deep ties to Compton, California—the same city where her sister was killed in a drive-by shooting.Yetunde Price, the oldest half-sister of Serena and Venus Williams, was shot and killed on September 14, 2003, in Compton. A personal assistant to the Williams sisters and a nurse, Price was caught in gunfire by Robert Maxfield, a known Crip gang member. She was just 31 years old. Maxfield was later convicted of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to 15 years in prison.Williams’ Super Bowl performance was met with mixed reactions, with some praising her participation in Lamar’s high-energy set, while others condemned her for what they saw as a thoughtless gesture. The Crip Walk, or C-Walk, has long been associated with the Los Angeles-based gang, making her decision particularly controversial given her family's history with gang violence.American columnist Jason Whitlock on his 'Fearless' podcast lashed out at Serena calling her a ""clown"".Speaking about her appearance, Williams revealed that Lamar personally invited her to join the performance. “When @kendricklamar and team called and was like ‘we’ve been trying to do something forever, what about this? We loved your Crip Walk at the Olympics after you won the gold medal,’” she wrote. “I’m like Super Bowl? Are you serious? When in the world would I ever be able to dance at a Super Bowl? (Never) let’s do it!”Williams had previously performed the Crip Walk after her victory over Maria Sharapova in the 2012 London Olympics, which had also drawn criticism at the time. Reflecting on her Super Bowl appearance, she joked, “Man, I did not Crip Walk like that at Wimbledon. Oh, I would’ve been fined.”However, not everyone saw it as lighthearted. Sports analysts and social media users pointed out the uncomfortable link between her dance and her sister’s murder. One ESPN commentator accused Williams of “trolling” her reported ex, Drake, who was the target of Lamar’s diss track “Not Like Us.” Others, however, believed Williams was simply celebrating her Compton roots and supporting Lamar, another Compton native, in a career-defining moment.","Serena Williams sparked controversy after performing the Crip Walk during Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime show.

Theare set to face the New York Knicks in their final game before the All-Star Break, but all eyes are on’s status as he deals with a lingering injury. The Hawks released their injury report ahead of tomorrow’s matchup at Madison Square Garden, revealing that Young is listed as probable with right Achilles tendinitis.Trae Young’s availability is crucial for the Atlanta Hawks, who are riding a three-game winning streak and looking to solidify their position in the Eastern Conference standings. Despite his probable status, Young’s recent performance has raised some concerns. In the Hawks’ recent win over the Orlando Magic, he struggled offensively, scoring 19 points on 6-17 shooting, including a dismal 1-8 from beyond the arc.It was not easy last night though vs the Orlando Magic. However, the Hawks received significant contributions from their bench, with Caris LeVert (18 points, eight rebounds), Terance Mann (12 points), and Dyson Daniels (10 points) stepping up to secure the victory.While Trae Young ’s injury is a focal point, the Hawks are also dealing with other key absences. Vit Krejci (lower back contusion) and Larry Nance Jr. (right knee injury) have been ruled out for tomorrow’s game after sustaining injuries in the fourth quarter against the Magic. Additionally, Clint Capela’s status remains unclear. Though not listed on the injury report, Capela has been inactive for the past two games, leaving questions about how the Hawks will manage their frontcourt against the Knicks.The Atlanta Hawks ’ recent success has been fueled by their revamped bench, which contributed 54 points in the win over Orlando. The additions of LeVert, Mann, and Georges Niang have provided much-needed depth, helping Atlanta stay competitive in a tightly contested Eastern Conference.Trae Young's play and health will be crucial as the Hawks get ready for a difficult game against the Knicks.

From Setback to Spring Training Sensation: Drew Thorpe’s Comeback is On!



This Tuesday made things a little brighter in terms of Chicago White Sox spring training , because of the unexpected turns around the story of Drew Thorpe's elbow injury. It began as something to get disappointed over, but by the end of the evening, it was sounding more like a cliffhanger-maybe a comeback?Initially, the statement was true enough for White Sox fans to reach for their nearest stress ball. Early Tuesday, news broke that Thorpe, one of the team's former top pitching prospects, had suffered a setback with his elbow this offseason and may likely begin the year on the injured list. A bummer by itself when fans had just begun to ready themselves for the return to the mound.“Drew Thorpe is feeling good,” Getz said. “He’s playing catch right now. He’ll be on a mound here shortly. We do expect him to be a little behind some of these other starters, but with that being said, we feel like he’s going to be active throughout Spring Training.”Bring on the collective sigh of relief. So where do we stand now? It seems Thorpe will not be at the front line of the rotation just yet—he'll be a little behind his fellow starters as the team moves through spring camp. However, things are looking good as it doesn't appear that he will miss the entire season opener after all. Getz's words are encouraging, making it sound like the 24-year-old pitcher will fully recover and see action with the team through the exhibition season. That's a bit of a turn from earlier ""injury list"" talk.This elbow setback was a little concerning, but did not racket Thorpe too far off track and that's a relief to a team that is looking to inject some youthful exuberance into its pitching staff. The former top prospect acquired in the 2021 trade with the Yankees has long been in the cards for the White Sox future pitching staff, and fans are eager to see what he brings to the mound once healthy.While the precise date of a return to throwing within full capacity still hangs in the balance, the latest news has opened up a glimmer of hope for anxious followers dreaming about Thorpe's coming to the majors. During the camp, fans might be struggling with patience against getting more news in hopes that the youth star will soon be back at it instead of later.So, while it was not exactly all chocolates at the beginning, it seems that there is still some hope for Drew Thorpe. And in the world of baseball, sometimes even the most outrageous roller coaster of emotions can drop to the ground in a safe place. For now, straight ahead into spring training.","Drew Thorpe suffered a setback with his elbow this offseason and may likely begin the year on the injured list.

His presence on the court has been sporadic due to ongoing injury concerns, though the latest injury report does not list him among the sidelined players.

'We don't look at averages and stats': Gautam Gambhir on sending Axar Patel at No. 5

Sachin Tendulkar Exclusive Interview: On ISPL, memories of tennis ball cricket and more

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli is unlikely to lead the Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) in the upcoming edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL). It is reliably learnt that Kohli, who earlier held discussions with the management during the time of leadership vacuum, may not take up the role for IPL 2025 .With Kohli giving strong indications to the management, the think tank have been in a huddle for the last few weeks. Their entire auction strategy seemed to have revolved around Kohli and now that he may not take the job, the franchise has no option but to look within the group as they didn't show any desire to get a captain at the mega auction.It is further understood that the management has already had multiple discussions with senior India players in the RCB camp and Rajat Patidar has emerged as the frontrunner to lead the franchise from the 2025 edition. Krunal Pandya, who has proven captaincy credentials, is also an option as he always has been in the ""leadership plans"" of the franchise.It is learnt that the RCB management rates Krunal's leadership acumen very highly too and the all-rounder, who has been doing a stellar job as Baroda captain in the domestic circuit, continues to be part of the leadership group.RCB have sent an invite for a ""special media gathering for key announcement"" on February 13 and a captaincy announcement is likely. Director of Cricket Mo Babat, Head Coach Andy Flower and some key representatives of the franchise will be in attendance.There is also a possibility of mentor and batting coach Dinesh Karthik being present as he, too, played a key role in solving the captaincy puzzle.Patidar led Madhya Pradesh to Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy final this year where they lost to Mumbai in the title clash. He was the second-highest run-getter this season with 428 runs in nine innings.","Virat Kohli is unlikely to lead the Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) in the upcoming edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) It is reliably learnt that Kohli, who earlier held discussions with the management during the time of leadership vacuum, may not take up the role for IPL 2025.

Chad ""Ochocinco"" Johnson believes Travis Kelce might take a pay cut to stay with the Kansas City Chiefs next season. He pointed out that Kelce's off-field earnings and his relationship with billionaire Taylor Swift could make a lower salary more manageable for him.The Kansas City Chiefs ended their 2024 season with a tough 40-22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LIX. Throughout the year, 35-year-old tight end Travis Kelce showed signs of slowing down, finishing with 97 catches for 823 yards and just three touchdowns—his lowest numbers in years.Looking ahead to 2025, Travis Kelce carries a $19.8 million cap hit, the highest among NFL tight ends. This has sparked speculation that the Chiefs might release him to free up cap space.However, former NFL star Chad ""Ochocinco"" Johnson believes Kelce could take a pay cut to stay with the team. Johnson pointed out that Kelce’s off-field earnings, along with his relationship with billionaire Taylor Swift, could make it easier for him to accept a lower salary.“Trust me, he's good. He’s dating a billionaire. I think he has no worries… To come back and keep the band together, to be able to get some other key offseason acquisitions, I have no problem with doing that, and coming back, and giving this thing another go. He can do that, so he’s not one that’s hurtin’, so he’ll be fine,” Ocho said on Nightcap.Chad Ochocinco Johnson and co-host Shannon Sharpe also emphasized that Kelce doesn't just depend on his future spouse and football earnings. He has effectively leveraged his athletic achievements to generate income in other industries, earning $35 million from endorsements last year—more than double his $17 million NFL salary for 2024.Travis Kelce's net worth saw a significant boost, rising from an estimated $40 million in 2023 to $52 million by the start of the 2024 season. His impressive earnings aren't just from football—Kelce has secured lucrative endorsement deals with major brands across various industries. These include Nike (athletic apparel), Old Spice (grooming), Experian (financial services), State Farm (insurance), and Bud Light (beverages). His diverse portfolio reflects his ability to capitalize on his athletic success and expand his influence across multiple sectors of the business world.Travis Kelce has expanded his wealth through investments in fitness, real estate, and his production company, 1991 Productions, along with owning Kansas City restaurants. With his diverse income, he’s financially secure and could take a pay cut to stay with the Chiefs in 2025, especially given his recent performance.“Travis Kelce’s a team player… He’s making so much money off the field, he’s not going to have a problem taking a pay cut. He’s not gonna have a problem doing that. Because he’s gonna make up whatever he doesn’t get off the field, because he has so much going on. It’s the same situation with Tom Brady. In Tom Brady’s day, he was taking pay cuts in New England to make sure they kept the team around him,” Johnson continued.Travis Kelce, once the best tight end in the NFL, has seen a decline in his production over the last few seasons. In 2024, he posted career lows in receiving yards (823), yards per reception (8.5), and touchdowns (3). While his 97 receptions ranked third and 823 yards ranked fifth among tight ends, they marked noticeable drops for him.The Chiefs hoped to unleash him in the playoffs, but despite a strong Divisional Round performance (117 yards), Kelce struggled in the AFC Championship and Super Bowl, combining for just 58 yards—his worst two-game playoff total.Also Read: FOX news anchor Erin Andrews accidentally ignored a big NFL star during a live broadcast, requiring her to extend an apology Travis Kelce’s $17.125 million salary in 2024 made him the highest-paid tight end, based on his past success. However, with his recent drop in performance, it’s likely the Chiefs will need to restructure his deal. Tying up over 6% of the salary cap in an aging player who’s no longer reaching 1,000 yards is a burden for a championship-contending team. To maintain flexibility and stay competitive, the Chiefs may need to renegotiate his contract or seek a pay cut.","Chad ""Ochocinco"" Johnson believes Travis Kelce might take a pay cut to stay with the Kansas City Chiefs next season.

Houston Rockets injury report for tonight’s game against the Phoenix Suns (February 12, 2025)

Theface uncertainty as they prepare for their February 12 matchup against the Houston Rockets , with star guard’s status under scrutiny. Booker, who leads the Suns with 26.2 points per game (eighth in the NBA), has been a critical piece of the team’s offense, but recent developments have raised questions about his availability.The Suns’ injury report lists three players, excluding Devin Booker . This means that we can expect to see him in the starting five for the Suns tonight. His presence will significantly impact Phoenix’s performance. The team is dealing with injuries of Bradley Beal (day-to-day, toe) and Vasilije Micic (day-to-day, trade pending), leaving their backcourt depth in question.Booker’s recent form has been stellar, averaging 28.4 points, 4.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists over the last 20 games. His ability to stretch the floor with 2.6 three-pointers per game (29th in the NBA) has been vital for the Suns, who rank seventh in the league with 14.2 threes per game. Without him, the team’s offensive firepower would take a significant hit.The Rockets, meanwhile, are dealing with their own injury concerns, including Alperen Sengun (questionable, lumbar) and Fred VanVleet (out, ankle). Houston’s defense, ranked sixth in the NBA, could exploit a Booker-less Suns lineup, especially given Phoenix’s struggles on the boards (25th in rebounds per game).Booker's health is still a crucial consideration as the Suns want to move up the Western Conference standings. Ahead of the 8:30 PM ET tip-off at Toyota Centre, fans will be closely monitoring the situation for any updates. The issue remains for the time being: Will Devin Booker play, or will the Suns need to find a way to win without their top scorer?Also read: Will Kevin Durant play tonight against the Houston Rockets?

Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s $400 Million Gamble: Will the Jays Cash In or Swing and Miss?

Blue Jays’ $400M Gamble: Will Vladimir Guerrero Jr. Stay or Walk Away?""

This Is A GOOD Sign! Latest Vladimir Guerrero Jr. & Bregman Updates (Toronto Blue Jays News)

People in Toronto speak of baseball, but not home runs, or a bonehead play; this is all about the money-the big bucks. Our Blue Jays must work against the clock with Guerrero Jr. reaching the last year of arbi­trational eligibility. Perhaps this means they will have him under control for the last time in the season of 2025! Cue dramatic music!Since his debut, Guerrero Jr. has become the face of the team, and he hopes to sign a long-term deal with the Jays before spring training starts, which is fast approaching. However, it seems the Jays are keeping their purse strings extremely tight. Guerrero is apparently looking for a figure in the neighborhood of $400 million or more, and that is considered a low ball by baseball standards.And here lies the irony in the situation. The Blue Jays had opportunities to corner Shohei Ohtani and Juan Soto- the two superstars, who renewed themselves into free agency and walked away with $1.465 billion combined. While those names went on to play for other franchises, their decisions speak volumes: the Blue Jays can throw money at generational talents, but will they do it for Guerrero Jr.?Unanswered, and thus leaving some discomfort in the air, Guerrero Jr. could be looking for a huge payday, and while the Blue Jays might not act soon enough, they could lose him to some other suitor next year. While the team has shown competitive quality over the years and an interest in snaring other big names, Guerrero might feel more like being a backup option since they have been sluggish to respond to his financial expectations.If the Blue Jays indeed hand out any funds, they will soon lock one of the game's most exciting players. On the darker side of the coin, if he walks, that will definitely leave the Blue Jays pondering over what just went wrong while seeing his success somewhere else. By 2025, there's going to be a lot of drama around this contract negotiation, and the stakes just went up.","Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hopes to sign a long-term deal with the Jays before spring training starts.

Yankees’ Spring Training Shock: Jake Cousins’ Injury Throws Bullpen Into Chaos!



Jake Cousins on his exit in the 6th

Jake Cousins 2023 Highlights!

Spring training for the New York Yankees is now a reality, except that among the pitchers and catchers headed for Florida sunshine, a key reliever is pretty much taking more than just his glove; he is carrying an injury. And now enters one Jake Cousins, the subject of great honor concerning his arm instead of fastball.Last season, Cousins was making his mark with devastating stuff out of the bullpen; however, he faces an unforeseen hiccup after reporting to camp with a forearm strain. While it's not necessarily a curveball in the world of professional baseball; it certainly gives Yankees fans a little more reason to grip their seats. His status is already in question for Opening Day, and let's say the team is just a little bit jittery about it.From day one of camp, Manager Aaron Boone didn't quite ease those waters. Boone, however, did try to paint a silver lining, saying, “Concern? I guess a little bit, but also feel like we’re 15 days into a three-four week no-throw, and he seems to be doing well and progressing how he should,”Sure, it’s not the most endearing endorsement ever given, but it is a valid point. Cousins was himself very instrumental in the Yankees bullpen during 2024, pitching with that mix of velocity and control that made him a go-to option late in games. His slider was sharp, fastball reaching the high 90s, and he integrated into what could already be called an impressive bullpen setup.But with this injury, everything is up in the air. The Yankees have created a safe haven in what would normally pass for an airtight bullpen, only to see the chance of starting the season without one of its key members suddenly becoming a possibility. It could create a ripple effect, forcing other arms to step up early or even making the team go into considerations for an external addition to fill the void.So who is Jake Cousins? And what's the big deal? Well, the right-hander at 29 years was first drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in 2017 and raised eyebrows pretty high during his fast rise through the ranks. After gaining some time in the Brewers organization, he was finally acquired in a trade towards the end of last season by the New York Yankees. Almost instantly, Cousins has earned quite an inquisitive fanbase with his pitch and performance at the plate in those close-out moments.The biggest question now: Will his arm heal in time for the season opener? The New Yorkers are holding their breath and hoping Cousins comes out of this setback as strong as ever, for it seems the success of the bullpen may hinge on it. So stay tuned, Yankee fans-this could be a wild ride to recovery.",Jake Cousins was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in 2017. He was traded to the New York Yankees at the end of last season. Cousins was a key member of the Yankees' bullpen last year. He is currently in spring training with a forearm strain.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118187640,imgsize-48468,width-400,resizemode-4/118187640.jpg"

Theare reportedly considering a surprising move to strengthen their roster by targeting. Currently playing for Selene Bogdons in the Mongolian Basketball League, Cousins could provide the Lakers with a much-needed boost in the paint alongside Luka Doncic and LeBron James The Los Angeles Lakers secured their first win of the Doncic era on Monday night with a 132-113 victory over the Utah Jazz, improving their record to 32-19 and solidifying their position as the No. 4 seed in the Western Conference. Both Doncic and James showcased their dominance in the paint, frequently connecting with center Jaxson Hayes through lob passes. However, this performance has sparked speculation about whether the team could benefit from a more experienced center.NBA insider Brian Windhorst recently floated the idea of the Los Angeles Lakers pursuing DeMarcus Cousins. During an appearance on ESPN’s First Take, Windhorst said,This suggestion has reignited discussions about Cousins’ potential return to the NBA.At 34, Cousins is no longer the dominant force he once was, but his skill set could still make him a valuable asset. The former No. 5 overall pick in the 2010 NBA Draft, DeMarcus Cousins enjoyed a stellar career with the Sacramento Kings and New Orleans Pelicans, earning four All-Star selections and two All-NBA nods. His peak came during the 2016-17 season, when he averaged 27.0 points, 11.0 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game. Known for his versatility, Cousins was also a capable three-point shooter, boasting a career average of 33.1% from beyond the arc.If Cousins were to join the Los Angeles Lakers, he could serve as a reliable rim-runner and floor-spacing option in limited minutes. His ability to set screens and finish plays would complement the playmaking brilliance of Doncic and James.

However, his presence on the injury report raises questions about his performance and potential limitations on the court.The Lakers' injury report is lengthy, with nine players listed. Alongside James, Austin Reaves (elbow) is also probable, while key players like Gabe Vincent (knee) and Dorian Finney-Smith (ankle) are ruled out. Rookie Bronny LeBron James (forearm) and Luka Doncic (calf) are questionable, adding further uncertainty to the Lakers' rotation.On the Jazz side, injuries have also taken a toll. Collin Sexton (ankle) and Kenyon Martin Jr. (trade pending) are out, while Taylor Hendricks (fibula) is sidelined for the season. Despite their struggles, the Jazz have shown resilience, with Lauri Markkanen leading the team in scoring at 19.2 points per game. The Lakers enter the game with a slight edge, outscoring opponents by 1.1 points per game this season. LeBron James has been instrumental in their success, ranking 14th in the league in scoring and 28th in rebounds with 7.8 per game. However, the team’s three-point shooting remains a concern, ranking 24th in the NBA with 12.2 made threes per game.Fans can catch the action on SportsNet LA and KJZZ or stream it live on Fubo.

I was a communications major in my college. I love to be behind it. That’s my bread and butter. But at the end of the day, if it creates opportunities like this where we can leverage my network and figure out how to impact a community that has been so kind to the entire Kelce family, I’m so happy to be able to give back to the Kansas City in this way.”“She’s such a wonderful human being!”“Humble, supportive, well-spoken, classy, and down-to-earth- she’s even a “stands kinda girl!” Sign me up for Kylie Kelce fan club!!”“She’s a breath of fresh air♥️”“Jason married up, love the Kelce fam but Kylie is definitely top tier Kelce.”“She is so gracious.

DeShon Elliott Has Savage Jibe Over Rumours Of Aaron Rodgers Joining Steelers



The Pittsburgh Steelers are facing a crucial moment regarding their quarterback situation and they do not have a clear long-term solution under center at the moment. And insider Jay Glazer recently reported that Russell Wilson will not return to Pittsburgh, and the team may be eyeing Aaron Rodgers since the latter is reportedly not returning to the Jets. And now Steelers safety DeShon Elliott has shared a scathing remark over the possibility of Rodgers signing with the Steelers.Glazer, who is close to Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin, reported last week that he sees Wilson looking for a new team this offseason. This poses problems for the Steelers because, without a high first-round draft pick, Pittsburgh is unlikely to land either Cam Ward or Shedeur Sanders; this means the team brass may be looking to the free agent market. And with Rodgers available, rumours are swirling over the possibility of him signing with the Steelers.Elliott, a sixth-year safety for Steelers commented on a post made by an aggregator account on Instagram which stated Steelers was a potential landing spot for Rodgers. “Leave his ass at the retirement home,” Elliott commented.Also Read: Super Bowl Rings: Cost, History, Winners and More Rodgers will be 42 next season, and has not yet confirmed whether he does intend to play should he be released from the Jets. Jets head coach Aaron Glenn reportedly had some clear demands for Aaron’s return. According to sports journalist Dianna Russini, the franchise was open to him returning, but Glenn wanted full involvement in the offseason and, notably, a step back from his media appearances, including his role in The Pat McAfee Show.","Pittsburgh Steelers safety DeShon Elliott has shared a scathing remark over the possibility of Aaron Rodgers signing with the Steelers.

The Bills need help on the interior of their defensive line after they struggled this season. Much like off the edge, they need to find a way to generate consistent pressure from the interior as well and Williams can help that.

He just racked up two sacks and a strip-sack in the Super Bowl against a stout Chiefs interior offensive line.

Ed Oliver and Williams would form a nice pass-rushing duo from the interior. At just 25 years old, Williams is projected to fetch a three-year $36 million deal with a $12 million average.

LA Chargers Head Coach Jim Harbaugh Slammed For Coaching Blunder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/la-chargers-head-coach-jim-harbaugh-slammed-for-coaching-blunder/articleshow/118188874.cms,"Jim Harbaugh was recently slammed for a hiring decision. Source: Reuters

Did Jim Harbaugh’s Hiring Blunder Cost Chargers A Super Bowl Win?

After a challenging phase, the LA Chargers seemed to have found stability under Jim Harbaugh . And though fans and team brass have been largely happy with Harbaugh, a single blunder has miffed the fans after he chose not to retain Kellen Moore from the previous staff and instead hired Greg Roman , who he worked with during his time with the San Francisco 49ers.It’s no secret that Moore just helped guide the Philadelphia Eagles to a Super Bowl, whereas the Chargers' offense struggled quite a bit in 2024, as they finished 20th in the NFL. And now Jason Reed of Bolt Beat has slammed Harbaugh over the wrong hiring decision.""The Chargers had the chance to keep Moore around under the new coaching regime,"" Reed wrote. ""Harbaugh did that with special teams coordinator Ryan Ficken. The team could have blocked Moore from interviewing for other offensive coordinator positions. However, Harbaugh had his guy who he had prior ties to and that was that. Roman was brought in while Moore quickly took the offensive coordinator job with the Eagles just four days after the Bolts hired Harbaugh.""Reed then went on to explain that LA Chargers ’ offense looked great under Moore back in 2023 and that Harbaugh should have considered that. ""In a perfect world, Harbaugh would have seen that nuance and would have given Moore one more year to give his star quarterback some play-calling consistency,"" Reed continued.Also Read: Davante Adams Eyeing a Move to LA? Rams and Chargers on His Radar ""Moore would not have solved the personnel issues on the interior offensive line or at wide receiver, but he definitely could have squeezed more out of the Chargers' offense than Roman did.""However, it’s important to remember that The Chargers’ offense faced numerous setbacks during the 2023 season, from key injuries to staffing issues which left fans wondering about the coaching team and their choices. However, back then it became quite evident that good coaching decisions were largely responsible for the team’s success","Jim Harbaugh was recently slammed for a hiring decision.

Anthony Rendon’s Long History of Injuries Continues to Frustrate the Angels and Hinder His Impact on the Team

Yoan Moncada Steps in as a Temporary Solution but Raises Concerns About His Own Durability and Performance

Another setback has struck the Los Angeles Angels and their huge investment into Anthony Rendon. The third baseman is set for surgery on his hip, which will rule him out for a long time. This most recent injury continues a troublesome compilation of injuries, raising the question whether the Angels' $245 million deal with Rendon belongs among the worst contracts in the team's history.When the Angels decided to sign former Nationals' star Anthony Rendon to a seven-year deal following his 2019 season, they envisioned him as a long-term cornerstone at third base. Yet, injuries have gradually unstrung those expectations. Since coming on board in 2020, Rendon has appeared in a mere 257 games, averaging just over 50 games a season. That period saw him smashing a .242/.348/.369 line for 3.7 WAR, far too below the elite production the Angels had envisioned from him.It's recently reported that Angels GM Perry Minasian has just stated that Rendon will need hip surgery and be on the shelf for a ""long-term"" basis. Perhaps there's also a bigger concern as he just seems to have suffered so many injuries. Since 2021, Rendon has been placed on the injured list 12 times and has missed substantial parts of each season. Another major setback is now on the plate that raises the question of whether he will ever regain his All-Star form.To fill the gap at third base, the Angels have signed Moncada to a one-year contract for $5 million. While 29-year-old Moncada has shown flashes of potential, however, there are some durability woes attached. He hasn't played above 100 games in a season since 2022, and his recent offensive numbers—.236/.291/.387 over the past three years—don't exactly suggest a clear solution.The Angels' front office has aggressively reshaped the roster this winter—the additions of Jorge Soler, Travis d'Arnaud, Tim Anderson, and Kenley Jansen are highlights. To further worsen the minority problems, Rendon would be out for the long-term and Moncada would join in a rookie capacity.Anthony Rendon’s latest injury is yet another reminder of how unpredictable long-term contracts can be. The Angels bet big on him being their franchise third baseman, but ongoing injuries have made that vision nearly impossible to achieve. As Rendon faces another lengthy rehab process, the Angels are left scrambling for answers—wondering if this $245 million gamble will ever pay off.Also Read: Barry Bonds Says No, Dodgers Say Yes—Should Ohtani Pitch Again?","Anthony Rendon is set for surgery on his hip, which will rule him out for a long time.

The Eagles Defeated The Chiefs On Super Bowl; What Can They Teach NFL Teams?

Invest in a Versatile Offense

Draft and Develop Wisely

Defensive Adaptability

The Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl, thwarting their aspirations for a historic ""three-peat.” Though some fans are shocked, analysts agree that the Eagles’ win is not exactly shocking considering their form. As the focus now shifts to the rest of the NFL, teams will need to find ways to build their own championship aspirations for the 2025 season.Every NFL season presents unique challenges, many of which can’t be anticipated, such as changes in player rosters and coaching staff, significant injuries to crucial positions, and scheduling difficulties. Moreover, replicating the skill and mindset of elite quarterbacks like Jalen Hurts or Patrick Mahomes is difficult. A team thrives on the chemistry of its players which develops over time and is honed by team-building and smart plays. The Super Bowl 59 was even deemed a ‘one-sided’ game owing to the Eagles’ domination and needless to say, other NFL teams can gather some insights from this win.The Eagles played a smart, offensive game plan that effectively utilized the strengths of their players. Quarterback Jalen Hurts is known to be an exceptional passer but on Sunday, he showed off his ability to run the ball and added a dynamic element to the Eagles' offense. This kept the Chiefs' defense guessing and allowed the Eagles to exploit mismatches. NFL teams should consider developing an offense that can adapt to various strategies and also come up with defensive schemes to challenge the other team. This includes investing in multi-dimensional players who can contribute in creative formations and play designs.Also Read: Philadelphia is getting ready for Super Bowl parade with over 1 million expected fans: All you need to know Many of Philly’s key players from Jalen Hurts to defensive star Haason Reddick, were players who had been cultivated within the organization. Their ability to identify prospects that fit their system has paid off, as they are not only skilled but also aligned with the team's approach from the beginning. NFL teams need to prioritize smart drafting and develop players so they can grow within their team.This would mean exploring every player’s strengths and not pigeonholing them from the beginning. This also involves looking for players who not only possess raw talent but also fit the team’s strategic objectives and culture.The Eagles’ defense has a lot of important lessons for other teams. The Eagles consistently disrupted Patrick Mahomes' rhythm which also affected the flow of the team. It’s crucial for NFL teams to have a flexible defensive strategy that can adjust to various offensive threats. This includes studying opponents closely to anticipate their game plan and being willing to tweak approaches for important games which can sometimes make players nervous but can pay off on the field. Developing a deep talent pool on defense can make it easier for the coaching staff to strengthen the team.","The Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl, thwarting their aspirations for a historic ""three-peat"" The Eagles played a smart, offensive game plan that effectively utilized the strengths of their players.

Goa end 13-game winless run against Mumbai in style,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/goa-end-13-game-winless-run-against-mumbai-in-style/articleshow/118199431.cms,"MUMBAI: It was the moment which summed up Mumbai City's miserable night. Already trailing 2-0 - not for the first time at the Mumbai Football Arena this season - any faint hopes of a comeback against an FC Goa side oozing confidence were killed after a terrible blunder by centre half Mehtab Singh in the 64th minute.Goa winger Udanta Singh, who had already tormented Mumbai's lacklustre backline a fair bit by then, picked up a clearance by Islanders goalkeeper Phurba Lachenpa and sent in a cross. Seemingly unsure what to do with it, Mehtab ended up heading the ball perfectly into the path of the lurking Borja Herrera Gonzalez who calmly slotted past Lachenpa at the near post. 3-0, game as good as over!In a fixture where pre-match story lines revolved around players facing their past, Spanish striker Iker Guarrotxena , who had an unfortunate short-lived stint at the Islanders last season, returned to haunt his former team, scoring twice for Goa in the first half. An injury-time penalty put away by captain Lallianzuala Chhangte was all Mumbai could console themselves with in the end.For the visitors, the 3-1 result was an emphatic way to end a horrendous 13-match winless streak against Mumbai in the Indian Super League . It also helped Manolo Marquez 's side consolidate second place (39 pts) in the standings, and perhaps, keep alive their faint hopes of catching runaway leaders Mohun Bagan SG (46 pts) in the race for the League Winners Shield.For the hosts, who remain fifth (31 pts), it was another evening to forget at the Arena. They did go into the game having beaten Mohammedan SC 3-0 before playing out a goalless draw with East Bengal in their last two outings here. But whenever they have taken on teams above them in the table, it's often been a struggle, and sure enough, Petr Kratky's side sank to their fourth home defeat of the season.The absence of the injured Greek striker Nikolaos Karelis does seem to be weighing on the reigning ISL Cup holders as Kratky decided to give Jan signing Jorge Ortiz his first start.Barring one effort on target late in the first half and a couple of moments in the second, the Spanish forward wasn't quite able to inspire Mumbai against his old team. For that matter, neither could Brandon Fernandes, who switched to Mumbai after seven seasons with his hometown side last summer, and was loudly jeered by his old fans in the away stand every time he touched the ball.Guarrotxena, though, had the most enjoyable evening of the three men on the pitch who were taking on their former teams. After picking up an Udanta pass across the edge of the box and placing a right-footed finish through a crowd of blue shirts into the bottom right corner for his first (24th), he then neatly turned in the winger's cross on the half volley to double Goa's lead in the 41st minute.",Goa end 13-match winless streak against Mumbai with 3-1 win. Iker Guarrotxena scores twice for Goa. Borja Herrera Gonzalez and Lallianzuala Chhangte also on target for visitors. Petr Kratky's side suffer fourth home defeat of season.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118199392,imgsize-46182,width-400,resizemode-4/118199392.jpg"
