Tom Brady admitted to one Lamar Jackson record that he could never complete

Lamar Jackson 's MVP performance in the Baltimore Ravens ' 41-38 overtime win over the Cincinnati Bengals was a standout. The two-time and reigning league MVP completed 26 of 42 pass attempts for 348 yards and four touchdowns, while rushing for 55 yards on 12 carries. His team erased a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter, securing their third straight win and a spot on Fox Sports analyst Tom Brady 's '3 Stars of the Week' list.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes Shared a Heartwarming Moment With His Daughter Before their Upcoming Game Against the New Orleans Saints Tom Brady acknowledged that there is one Lamar Jackson record, he would have no chance to complete.

Brady praised the Bengals vs. Ravens game as an ""incredible game,"" where the Ravens overcame a 10-point deficit in the last six minutes. He complimented Lamar's statistical analysis of the Ravens QB's performance. “Lamar’s been unbelievable this season. This is one record that I would have no chance to ever complete. He’s the first player in history to have 300 pass yards, 50 rush yards, and 4 touchdowns in multiple games"", Brady said.Brady has a career record of 132 games with at least 300 passing yards and 41 with four or more touchdowns. However, he never had a game with 50 rushing yards. Jackson, on the other hand, is one of the greatest dual-threat quarterbacks in NFL history, having only gone past the 30-yard mark once in his career.Lamar Jackson became the first NFL quarterback to finish a game with 300+ passing yards, 50+ rushing yards, and 4+ passing touchdowns in Week 5 of the 2021 season. He completed the game with 442 passing yards, four touchdown passes, and 62 rushing yards on 14 carries. Only eight other players have achieved this feat, including Josh Allen, Mitchell Trubisky, Alex Smith, Deshaun Watson, Michael Vick, Bobby Hoying, and Steve Young.

SKY to play in second match

MUMBAI: Keen to revive his Test career and running out of time to make a case for inclusion in India's squad for the big tour Down Under in November, Shreyas Iyer will be eager to score runs and remind the national selectors of his potential.Mumbai, riding the rare high of being the reigning Ranji Trophy and Irani Cup champions, begin their Ranji title defence against Baroda at the brand-new Kotambi International Cricket Stadium in Vadodara on Friday.In a topsy-turvy year, Iyer has seen ups and downs. He lost his BCCI contract due to a perceived reluctance to play Ranji Trophy matches but also enjoyed success, playing a crucial part in Mumbai's Ranji triumph and leading the Kolkata Knight Riders to an IPL title.However, his red-ball form this season has been modest-he scored two fifties in three matches (six innings) during the Duleep Trophy , and 57 and 8 in the Irani Cup tie in Lucknow.This season, Mumbai will have a new-look team. Young batsman Angkrish Raghuvanshi, who impressed for Knight Riders in the IPL but is recovering from a back injury, is likely to play at No. 3 in the absence of the injured Musheer Khan. Teenager Ayush Mhatre , who scored 19 and 14 on his first-class debut in the Irani Cup, is set to make his Ranji Trophy debut as well.Meanwhile, India T20 skipper Suryakumar Yadav is expected to feature in Mumbai's second Ranji match, against Maharashtra, at the MCA's Bandra-Kurla Complex ground from October 18.",Mumbai begin their Ranji title defence against Baroda on Friday.

NEW DELHI: When Rinku Singh top-edged a fast full toss off Tanzim Sakib for a six over the wicketkeeper to bring up his half-century on Wednesday night, he animatedly pointed at his left forearm. There's a tattoo on that forearm which reads 'God's plan'.It has never been easy to be Rinku Singh - right from his humble beginnings to making a name in Indian cricket through a stellar IPL 2023 .Yet, for once, it seemed he was speeding along on a freeway till Jan 2024. His initiation in international cricket made him the toast of Indian cricket. The selectors said leaving him out of the first 15 for the T20 World Cup was one of the toughest decisions.However, he has struggled to be in the driver's seat since the last IPL. The game time with the bat in hand has come down significantly. He has faced just 67 balls in the last 10 T20Is. In the IPL he played just 113 balls compared to 317 in IPL 2023. With cut-throat competition in Indian cricket, the fear of being forgotten is real.""If you look at the IPL, our team was winning consistently. As long as the team is doing well, I have n o complaints,"" Rinku said with a sheepish smile after the second T20I win on Wednesday. ""When I come to bat with 2-3 overs left, my aim is to hit more fours and sixes. My main aim is to collect more and more runs for the team,"" was his rather generic reply.""At the position I play, I get batting at different junctures of the game. Whenever I get batting earlier, my aim is to take singles and doubles and attack the bad balls,"" he said.Credit to the team management, it ensured Rinku got time to face more balls on Wednesday. Hardik Pandya and Riyan Parag were held back, giving him the responsibility to rebuild the innings at 41/3 with another rookie Nitish Reddy at the other end.It's the culture in Indian cricket that gives these boys the license to kill. That probably helps them shed any inhibition that could impact their batting. ""The coach and captain have asked us to play our game and whatever the situation (is), the message from them is maarte jao ball ko (just keep hitting the ball),"" said Rinku.Opportunities do come by frequently in Indian cricket but they disappear very quickly too if one fails to pounce on them.

England had a record breaking first innings where they plundered 823/7 declared with Harry Brook slamming a triple century and a double ton for Joe Root The duo took England past the 600-run mark in the opening session on Thursday (Day 4) as they brought up their individual double centuries.They helped the visitors overtake Pakistan's first innings total of 556. Babar Azam put down a simple chance early on day four, dropping a catch from Joe Root at mid-wicket.Speaking during the TV coverage, Raja expressed his sympathy with the Pakistan bowling attack: ""I'm sure bowlers will be questioning the quality of this track because they bend their back and nothing has happened,"" said Raja. ""You start questioning why such a surface was provided and why are we playing on such a surface at home.""As England piled on a jaw-dropping 823 runs, they became the first team to score 800-plus runs this century. It became the fourth instance of a team scoring over 800 runs in Test cricket history.Raja has turned to commentary since serving as the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) between September 2021 and December 2022.He came under criticism when he declared that Pakistan were ""years away from preparing a good five-day pitch"" during England's win in Rawalpindi in 2022. The surface in that Test was rated 'below average' and given a demerit point.Among Raja's critics on the topic was former seamer Wasim Akram, who - during Pakistan's series against Australia in 2022 - denounced Raja's influence over the types of Test match pitches prepared in Pakistan.The second Test between Pakistan and England, which will begin next week, will also be played in Multan, before the final Test shifts to Rawalpindi.Given the amount of runs scored on this wicket and the difficulty bowlers have had in taking wickets, the groundstaff may well undertake significant work during the gap days to ensure a repeat of the first Test doesn't take place in the second.","Raja questioned why the pitch in Multan for the first Test match against England was not created to assist the hosts' bowling attack.

Yes, they are youngsters in terms of age and the amount of cricket they have played. But, I think overall, mentally and in their development as a cricketer, I think they have the leadership qualities that are required. You don't need to have a vice-captain that should be designated,"" Nayar had stated when asked about the red-ball vice-captaincy.""I think overall, the thought process of these youngsters is of a senior player. It's someone who has played a lot of cricket.""",Rohit Sharma could miss one of the first two Test matches in Australia due to personal reasons. The Indian team will embark on a tough five-Test series in Australia starting November 22.

Terceros stunner

Argentina were held to a 1-1 draw by Venezuela on Lionel Messi 's return as Brazil got their 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign back on track with a last-gasp 2-1 victory over Chile on Thursday.The return of Lionel Messi to Argentina's starting line-up looked to have put the world champions on the way to victory after the Inter Miami superstar's free-kick set up an opening goal for Nicolas Otamendi after 13 minutes.But a battling performance by Venezuela in front of their home fans in Maturin was rewarded midway through the second half when the 35-year-old Rondon met Yeferson Soteldo's cross with a header that flew past Argentina goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli.Despite the dropped points, 2022 World Cup winners Argentina remain firmly on course for a place at the 2026 finals, which are being staged in the United States, Canada and Mexico.With the tournament expanded to 48 teams, the top six finishers in South America's 10-team round-robin qualifying competition will earn a ticket to the finals.Argentina lead the standings with 19 points from nine games, three points clear of second-placed Colombia, who suffered a shock 1-0 defeat to Bolivia in other qualifying action on Thursday.Yet while Argentina look poised to qualify comfortably, rivals Brazil continue to make hard work of their qualifying campaign.Chile, who are one place off the bottom of the standings, rocked Brazil after just two minutes when veteran striker Eduardo Vargas steered a looping header over Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson to make it 1-0.But Brazil drew level in first-half stoppage time after Savinho worked himself into space before crossing for Botafogo forward Igor Jesus to head home.The match looked destined to finish in a draw until the 89th minute, when Brazil substitute Luiz Henrique arrowed in a low shot from the edge of the area to make it 2-1.The win moves Brazil into fourth place in the standings with 13 points from nine games, six points adrift from leaders Brazil.Bolivia recovered from the first-half dismissal of midfielder Hector Cuellar to dig out victory in a game played in the thin air of El Alto, which is situated at around 4,150m (13,600 feet) above sea level.A superb individual goal from Miguel Terceros handed the Bolivians their fourth victory of qualifying and vaulted them up into the automatic qualification positions.Bolivia's fortunes have taken a dramatic upturn since the team started playing home qualifiers in El Alto, which is just over 500m higher than the Bolivians' usual home venue of the Estadio Hernando Siles in nearby La Paz.Bolivia opted to move fixtures to El Alto after losing two out of their opening three home qualifiers in La Paz last year.The move has paid off, with Thursday's 1-0 win coming after a 4-0 rout of Venezuela at the same venue in September.After claiming a shock 2-1 win away to Chile last month, Bolivia are now sitting in fifth place in the South American standings with 12 points from nine games.Bolivia last qualified for the World Cup at the 1994 finals in the United States, and played at the 1930 and 1950 tournaments after receiving invites to compete.Terceros's winning goal arrived in the 58th minute, with the 20-year-old winger who plays for Brazilian club Santos cutting in from the right flank, shimmying past Colombian defenders Jhon Lucumi and Kevin Castano and unleashing a left-footed thunderbolt that flew into the top corner.Bolivia are level on points with Ecuador, who moved up to fourth place in the table on Thursday after a 0-0 draw with Paraguay in Quito.In Thursday's other game, struggling Chile — who are one place off the bottom of the standings with just five points from eight games — host sixth-placed Brazil.","Argentina were held to a 1-1 draw by Venezuela on Lionel Messi's return.

Nitish Kumar Reddy made a significant impact on the international stage with a stellar half-century in just his second T20I match. The 21-year-old rose to the occasion when India found themselves under pressure after losing three wickets early during the powerplay in the second T20I against Bangladesh on Wednesday (9 October).Reddy exhibited composure and strategically navigated the challenging phase at the start of his innings.Once presented with a free-hit opportunity, he unleashed his aggression, sending the Bangladesh bowlers to all corners of the field.He formed a crucial partnership with Rinku Singh, adding 108 runs for the fourth wicket, which propelled India into a commanding position.During the second T20I, which India won by 86 runs, Reddy showcased his striking ability, securing his first half-century off just 27 balls. He was in exceptional form, hitting seven sixes and four fours to finish with an impressive 74 runs off 34 deliveries.His innings exemplified high-quality cricket - combining powerful hitting with an astute ability to find gaps, leaving the Bangladesh spinners at a loss for answers at times.Adjudged the Player of the Match, Nitish said, ""Feels great to represent India, feel so proud about this moment. Grateful for everything. I should give credit to captain (Suryakumar Yadav) and coach (Gautam Gambhir). They gave me the licence to play fearless cricket.

Tennis, a sport steeped in history and tradition, has produced some of the most remarkable athletes and extraordinary feats. While numerous records have been set and broken over the years, a few stand out as nearly unbeatable due to the sheer dominance and consistency required to achieve them.Here are the top five near-unbeatable records in tennis history that might never be surpassed.Rafael Nadal's dominance on the clay courts of Roland Garros is a story of unrivaled excellence. Nadal has clinched the French Open title an astounding 14 times, making it the most titles ever won by a single player at one Grand Slam tournament. Known as the ""King of Clay,"" Nadal's mastery of the surface is unmatched, as he has shown both skill and stamina year after year.Wimbledon, the oldest and most prestigious tennis tournament, has seen countless legends, but none quite like Martina Navratilova. Between 1978 and 1990, Navratilova secured nine singles titles at Wimbledon, the most by any player, male or female, in history. Her dominance on grass courts was unparalleled, and her ability to adapt and evolve her game over 12 years ensured her place as the queen of Wimbledon.In 1988, Steffi Graf accomplished a feat that no other player, male or female, has ever replicated: the Calendar Golden Slam. That year, she won all four Grand Slam titles (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open) and capped it off with a gold medal at the Seoul Olympics. This achievement, known as the ""Calendar Golden Slam,"" remains a singular milestone in tennis history.Roger Federer's 237 consecutive weeks at world No. 1 is one of the most impressive records in tennis. From February 2004 to August 2008, Federer held onto the top spot for nearly five years, a period of unparalleled consistency and dominance. No other player, past or present, has managed to maintain such a stranglehold on the No. 1 ranking for such an extended time.Margaret Court’s record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles remains the highest tally in tennis history for 50 years, till Novak Djokovic matched it in 2023. Achieved between 1960 and 1973, Court dominated across all surfaces, winning multiple titles at each Grand Slam event. Her versatility and consistent excellence set a benchmark that has proven incredibly difficult for subsequent generations to match.Novak Djokovic’s achievement of winning 24 Grand Slam singles titles is a monumental feat in tennis history. Spanning from his first title at the Australian Open in 2008 to his most recent at the 2023 US Open, Djokovic has consistently dominated across all surfaces and venues. His record not only cements his status as one of the greatest players in tennis but also highlights his unmatched adaptability and resilience over nearly two decades.",Roger Federer's 237 consecutive weeks at world No. 1 is one of the most impressive records in tennis. Rafael Nadal has clinched the French Open title an astounding 14 times. Steffi Graf won all four Grand Slam titles in 1988. Margaret Court's 24 Grand Slam singles titles remains the highest tally in tennis history for 50 years.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114039463,imgsize-57604,width-400,resizemode-4/114039463.jpg"
Ranji Trophy: All eyes on Manav Suthar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ranji-trophy-all-eyes-on-manav-suthar/articleshow/114135947.cms,"left-arm spinner on national selectors' radar

JAIPUR: Among the senior and junior players that Rajasthan have included in their squad for the first two Ranji Trophy 2024-25 matches, one exciting talent everyone will have their eyes on is Manav Suthar . The national selectors are taking keen interest in the 22-year-old left-arm spinner who has impressed with his all-round ability whenever made to take the field.The youngster's latest exploits were on exhibition at the recently concluded Duleep Trophy .In his debut game at the domestic championship, the Sri Ganganagar bowler impressed with his classical spin, registering figures of 7-59 in the second innings against India D in Anantapur. He followed it up with 19 not out that proved decisive in India C's win. The leg-spinner also notched up 82 in the first innings against India B in the second game.Looking back at the 2022-23 Ranji season when he made his First Class debut, he was the standout performer for Rajasthan and ended the tournament being the highest wicket-taker for the state with 39 wickets in 6 matches. His overall wicket tally in the season was 90 which included 10 wickets playing for India A at the Emerging Asia Cup held in Sri Lanka.Former Rajasthan batsman Vineet Saxena , under whom Suthar made his First Class debut, pointed out his 'rare ability'. ""It is the turn and bounce he gets at the pace at which he bowls is something rare to see. Generally to get that turn and bounce, one bowls slower but Manav gets it at a rather quicker pace. That is his big strength. This quality of his caught my eye when I first saw him. And during the season what I saw of him was his ability to pick wickets when the batsmen were defending,"" Saxena stated.The veteran also underscored the bowler's keenness to learn and work on his batting. ""That season he got two half centuries which included an unbeaten 96 which he scored in trying conditions in Pondicherry. Rajasthan didn't get a good start and his contribution in that situation helped. He has got the temperament to bat long. He works hard on his batting as well,"" the former Rajasthan head coach added.Another instance when Suthar the batsman showed up was while representing India A against England Lions in Ahmedabad at the start of the year. While chasing 490, India A were tottering at 219/5 and the 22-year-old clubbed with KS Bharat to stitch an unbeaten 207 runs partnership. Suthar chipped in with 89 not out off 254 balls, helping the team draw the match.Is there any advice for Suthar? ""He is in India reckoning and it's crucial for him to be consistent in his performance. He has it in him to achieve that consistency. Bowling on flat pitches is one area where he needs to work on,"" Saxena said.No doubt, there will be expectations from the young bowler and he will be keen to make most of the home conditions.",Sri Ganganagar bowler Manav Suthar is on national selectors' radar. The 22-year- old has impressed with his all-round ability whenever made to take the field. The youngster's latest exploits were on exhibition at the recently concluded Duleep Trophy.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114135935,imgsize-25248,width-400,resizemode-4/114135935.jpg"
Ranji Trophy: Test of character as UP face Bengal in season opener,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ranji-trophy-test-of-character-as-up-face-bengal-in-season-opener/articleshow/114135896.cms,"LUCKNOW: A new Ranji Trophy season brings a fresh challenge for the Uttar Pradesh team as they take on Bengal in their opening Elite Group C match at the Ekana Stadium starting Friday. It will be a test of their character and ability over the next four days, which will determine their prospects in the long-drawn tournament, scheduled to conclude in Jan next.UP will play three out of its seven matches in Lucknow, while Chandigarh, Kerala, Bihar, and Indore will host their away matches.The top two teams from the group will qualify for the knockouts. Bengal has always proved to be a tough opponent as in their 16 face-offs, UP has clinched three wins while Bengal has registered five victories. The remaining matches ended in a draw.UP's most famous win over Bengal came in 2006 at the KD Singh 'Babu' Stadium, when Mohammed Kaif led the team to lift its maiden Ranji Trophy based on the first innings lead.Over the last 80 years, UP have played 401 matches, winning 99 and losing 94, while 208 matches have been drawn. This means that if they beat Bengal outright, it will be their 100th win in the Ranji Trophy.UP has a strong batting line-up led by skipper Aryan Juyal , who scored 600 runs in the last Ranji season. Recently, he also scored 216 runs in three matches at the UPT20 league. In-form Swastik Chikara, who will make his first-class debut, also performed well in the UPT20 league, becoming the highest run-scorer with 499 runs to claim the Orange Cap.Top-order batter Priyam Garg has also been in good form. Opener Madhav Kaushik has played 17 first-class matches and scored 601 runs in 26 innings. Akshdeep Nath and Nitish Rana both have rich experience in first-class cricket, and they will provide solidity to the batting line-up.In the pace bowling department, UP has a strong unit led by the experienced Ankit Rajpoot, Aaqib Khan, and Yash Dayal. They will be supported by spinners Shivam Sharma and Vipraj Nigam, along with the seasoned all-rounder Saurabh Kumar , who has 72 matches under his belt. Saurabh scored more than 2,000 runs in 92 innings and also bagged 312 wickets in his first-class career.Led by Anustup Mazumdar the Bengal team is also very experienced with seasoned campaigners like Abhimanyu Easwaran, Sudip Chatterjee, and wicketkeeper Abhishek Porel. With the likes of Team India 's pacers Akash Deep and Mukesh Kumar along with all-rounder in Shahbaz Ahmed, they looked a formidable bowling attack too.Last year, UP could not advance to the knockouts as many of their games were affected by bad weather and rain. This season, fortunately, there are no matches scheduled from mid-November to late January, meaning there will be no games during the period when weather conditions in North India are severely impacted by fog and rain. The team is hopeful they will get to play all their matches without disruptions due to bad light or rain.Talking to TOI, UP team head coach Sunil Joshi said, ""We will go into the match with a balanced bowling attack. For me, all the bowlers-whether in the spin unit or the pace unit-will fight together. Every match is important for us. If we win this match, it will mark the 100th win for UP in the Ranji Trophy, and it will be a matter of great joy.""""We expect the pitch to be sporting, and we will play our best game on it. Moreover, the pitch will be the same for the opposition, so we have to be on our toes always. We have a very talented batting lineup and we are well prepared not only for this match but for the entire season ahead. Our first goal is to make it to the knockouts, and from there, we will see where we end up. But as a team, we are full of confidence,"" he added.","UP will play three out of its seven matches in Lucknow, while Chandigarh, Kerala, Bihar, and Indore will host their away matches.

KOLKATA: Finishing seventh among the eight teams in Elite Group D of Ranji Trophy last season, Odisha , under new coach Surendra Bhave , will hope that their season unfolds in a much better way as they kick start their 2024-25 campaign with an away game against Tripura in Agartala starting Friday.Veteran Govinda Poddar has been given the responsibility of captaining the side for the first two rounds of games and the top-order batter believes that they are much better prepared this time than the last few seasons.""As captain of the side I feel very confident of our chances this season. We are much better prepared than the last four-five seasons may be. Pre-season has been very good this year, we played a lot of tournaments outside Odisha. We participated in the KSCA invitational tournament after seven years. Then we played Services and Andhra in Visakhapatnam. During the rainy season, it's difficult to practise in the eastern part of the country, and we lose valuable time here. But this season, since we played a lot outside our state, we could prepare well,"" Poddar told TOI from Agartala ahead of their opening match.Stressing on the important coaching staff engaged by Odisha Cricket Association (OCA) ahead of the season, the right-hand batter added, ""Bhave sir has been very good for us, in my opinion he's the best coach from outside for Odisha in recent times. The way he's handling the players it's amazing, he has great communication skills. Then Narendra Hirwani sir joined us as spin bowling consultant in the pre-season which has helped the seniors as well as budding spinners of the state.""Asked about the importance of sessions by famous mental condition coach Dr Swaroop Savanur ahead of the season, Poddar said, ""It's been very helpful for all the players. We have been thinking about getting the help of a mental conditioning coach maybe for the last couple of years, so it's great to have one finally. Sometimes it's very difficult to overcome personal problems when you are playing, so it was great to learn how not to let that affect you when you are playing.""About playing Tripura at their home ground, the skipper said, ""It's foolish to take any team lightly these days and Tripura are a good team with three professionals (batters Mandeep Singh and Jiwanjot Singh and wicketkeeper-batter Srinivas Sharath ) in the side. We have our core team intact and batter Anil Parida is the only new member in the 17-member squad. So we are confident to do well this season. I only hope that the rain stays away during the match and the ground stays good as the condition of the outfield is pretty bad because of the continuous rain in recent days here.""",Odisha kick off their 2024-25 campaign with an away game against Tripura in Agartala starting Friday.

campaign against MP, will look to regain lost ground

The 2014-15 domestic season was all about team triumphs and personal milestones for Karnataka. They won the Vijay Hazare Trophy , the Ranji Trophy and the Irani Cup. There was an aura of invincibility about the team, of the kind generally only associated with the Mumbai team.Thereafter, the slide began, not a free fall, but a steady decline. Karnataka hasn't won the Ranji Trophy in a decade, and their last BCCI senior title win was in the 2019-2020 season.Every team goes through a transitional phase, but for Karnataka, it has stretched with the light at the end of the tunnel hardly in sight. The previous season, when Karnataka bowed out in the quarterfinals, witnessed eight debutants. This season too, when they begin their Ranji Trophy campaign against Madhya Pradesh in Indore on Friday, there is bound to be the injection of more fresh blood. However, the season will be as much about rookies proving their mettle as it will be about seasoned stars reinforcing their relevance.It wouldn't be out of place to assume that the title may be a tough reach, but what will be expected of them is performance and growth. While winning should still be the focal point, they should not sidetrack from the primary goal of building a team for the future and playing a fearless brand of cricket, which they were known for not so long ago.The onus will be on skipper Mayank Agarwal and his seasoned teammate, Manish Pandey . A big part of the golden era of Karnataka cricket, both haven't been at their best over the past few seasons and that has had a telling impact on the team. They, along with the talent of Devdutt Padikkal , should shoulder the responsibility of putting the team in a position of strength. With the exit of R Samarth, the opener's position is up for grabs. With Padikkal eyeing the No. 3 slot, youngsters like Nikin Jose and R Smaran could be in contention to open with Agarwal.The absence of an injured Vidwath Kaverappa notwithstanding, Karnataka will go into the season with a formidable pace attack led by Prasidh Krishna , who has a lot riding on the season as he returns from injury and looks to reclaim a spot in the national side. Vyshak Vijaykumar , V Koushik, and Vidhyadhar Patil offer plenty of options.The same cannot be said about the spin attack. Although the Karnataka think-tank made tall claims about ushering in a new era, they have given 30-year-old leggie Shreyas Gopal, who turned out for Kerala last season, a fresh start. He will have to justify his place, especially with young talents Hardik Raj and Moshin Khan keen to showcase their wares.Karnataka has gone back to Yere Goud to lead the coaching staff. The former Karnataka and Railways skipper has helmed the team for almost half the duration in the past decade, and it will be interesting to see if Goud, who was put in charge of the U-23 team midway through last season, can orchestrate a much-needed turnaround.",Karnataka begin their Ranji Trophy campaign against Madhya Pradesh on Friday. They haven't won the trophy in a decade and last won in 2019-2020 season.

KOLKATA: What is boon for a team, may turn out to be bane for another.As Assam begin their Ranji Trophy Group D campaign with a home game against Jharkhand at Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati starting Friday, they will miss their current best batter Riyan Parag for sure. The youngster, who was the captain last season, is away on national duty as he is part of the India squad for the three-match T20 International series against Bangladesh.In Riyan's absence, another youngster Denish Das is set to lead Assam.Middle order bat Das, now just 22, made his Ranji Trophy debut in the 2022-23 season and has played seven first-class matches for Assam. He also led the team in some matches last season.A new-look Jharkhand, on the other hand, will get a huge boost with the return of their explosive opening batter Ishan Kishan , who failed to turn up for the state team due to personal reasons last season. Kishan, who fell out with Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) for his absence from domestic cricket last season, will return to lead the Jharkhand team this season as he has been named the captain for the first two games.After the retirement of players like batter Saurabh Tiwary, spinner Shahbaz Nadeem and pacer Varun Aaron, it will be interesting to see how Jharkhand manage to fill in the void left by their long-serving veterans in every department of the game. Kishan's leadership ability, apart from his batting exploits, will also be tested in those stalwarts' absence.In the last edition, Jharkhand played seven matches, winning two, losing two and drawing three while Assam managed only a win. For both teams, the 2023-24 Ranji Trophy was clearly a disappointing one.Assam have seen a rise in white-ball cricket in recent years with semis finishes in Vijay Hazare Trophy in 2022 and in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy last year. But in the longest format of the game they are yet to taste much success and have never appeared in the knockouts.

Cricket Australia have unveiled plans for three Sheffield Shield matches to be played under lights this season. This initiative aims to provide domestic players with experience in day-night conditions, especially as Australia are set to host at least one pink-ball Test each summer going forward.The matches are strategically planned for Adelaide Oval, the Gabba, and Bellerive Oval, with Adelaide and the Gabba having been recent venues for pink-ball Tests.However, due to the scheduling, Australia’s current Test players will not have the opportunity to practice with the pink ball before the Test summer, despite most of them participating in at least one Shield game prior.On 23 November, South Australia and Western Australia will play a day-night pink-ball match at Adelaide Oval. This match occurs just two weeks before the day-night Test between Australia and India at the same venue in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, but none of the current Australian Test players will participate since it coincides with the first Test in Perth.The following day, Queensland will take on Victoria at the Gabba. This match may see one or both of Michael Neser and Scott Boland, who have experience playing with the pink ball, as potential selections for Australia this summer, subject to the fitness of the regular pace bowlers.In a late-season fixture, Tasmania will face New South Wales in a day-night pink-ball match at Bellerive Oval in Hobart starting on 15 March. It’s unlikely that Australia’s ODI players will be available for this match because they will have just returned from the Champions Trophy, but Nathan Lyon may be fit to play after his commitments with India and Sri Lanka.Ben Oliver, Cricket Australia's head of national teams, commented, ""We are always exploring opportunities to further enhance the experience for domestic players and best-prepare them for the challenges of international cricket,"" CA's head of national teams Ben Oliver said.""Playing first-class matches at Test venues is important, and so too is exposure to day-night conditions which have become a feature of the Australian Test summer over the past decade.""With that in mind, we felt it was the right time to re-introduce day-night Sheffield Shield matches for our next group of international cricketers.""CA consistently scheduled day-night Shield rounds between 2013-14 and 2017-18 and first experimented with day-night first-class cricket in the 1990s using yellow and orange balls. Since then, pink-ball matches have mainly been reserved for Australia A, the Prime Minister's XI, or CA XI games against touring teams.",Cricket Australia have unveiled plans for three Sheffield Shield matches to be played under lights this season.

Rajasthan amass 499 for 3 against Arunachal Pradesh to create new national record in Vinoo Mankad U-19 One-Day Trophy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/rajasthan-amass-499-for-3-against-arunachal-pradesh-to-create-new-national-record-in-vinoo-mankad-u-19-one-day-trophy/articleshow/114128436.cms,"Mohd Anas (L) and Kartik Sharma were involved in a record-breaking partnership of 484 runs for the third wicket in New Delhi on Thursday.

JAIPUR: It rained fours and sixes at the St. Stephen’s cricket ground in New Delhi on Thursday as Rajasthan literally sent Arunachal Pradesh fielders on a leather hunt to create a new national record in the Vinoo Mankad One-Day Trophy.Rajasthan colts piled a huge 499 for the loss of three wickets in their allotted 50 overs in their Group B penultimate league match against the minnows.Rounding up a perfect day, Rajasthan then bundled out Arunachal for a paltry 161 in 43.3 overs to post a thumping 338-run victory.In compiling nearly 500-run score, Rajasthan bettered the previous best team total of 466 for 6 achieved by Maharashtra against Meghalaya last season.Rajasthan skipper Kartik Sharma led from the front and remained unbeaten on 225. The wicketkeeper-batsman was involved in a record 484 runs partnership for the third wicket with Mohd Anas, who made a blistering 247 before getting dismissed in the last over. It was the highest partnership for any wicket in the Vinoo Mankad Trophy history.Surprisingly when the match started Rajasthan were reeling at 9 for 2 in the second over after opting to bat. Arunachal Pradesh pacer Sagar sent both the Rajasthan openers back to the pavilion cheaply in his opening over.However, Rajasthan recovered quickly after the double blow and launched a severe counterattack through Kartik and Anas, which floored their opponents. The right-handed duo milked the bowling attack of Arunachal to register their individual highest scores. Kartik was the more aggressive of the two as he raced to an unbeaten 225 off just 131 balls. He smashed 22 fours and 12 sixes during his 216-minute stay at the wicket.Anas also hammered 12 sixes, but he hit three boundaries more than his skipper (25 fours) on his way to 161-ball 247. Together the pair of Kartik and Anas put on a record stand of 484 runs off just 288 balls in 211 minutes.Thanks to double hundreds by Kartik and Anas, Rajasthan batsmen have now so far scored 4 double tons out of total six in the Vinoo Mankad Trophy history.Around a decade ago, Aditya Garhwal struck a couple of double hundreds in a single season when the tournament was held in Ghaziabad. Aditya’s 263 not out against Railways is still the highest by any batsman in the Mankad Trophy. He also slammed 212 against Vidarbha in the 2014-15 season.“Both Kartik and Anas were trying to break Aditya’s record of 263 but could not do it. Both the batsmen played perhaps their best innings today. The ground was big enough as it hosted senior tournaments including Ranji Trophy. It was a feast to watch for all of us when they complimented each other during their record-breaking partnership,” said Rajasthan team manager OP Sharma.Brief scoresRajasthan 499/3 in 50 overs (Kartik Sharma 225 not out, Mohd Anas 247; Sagar 2-93) beat Arunachal Pradesh 161 in 43.3 overs (Rahul Rawat 52, Sagar 33, Karan Drall 25; Toshit Bhatia 5-13, Naved Khan 2-38, Parve Jhalani 1-15) by 338 runs.","Rajasthan colts piled a huge 499 for the loss of three wickets in their Group B penultimate league match against the minnows.

Babar Needs To Takes Rest from Cricket | Brooks Aur Root Nay Pakistani Batters Ko Dikhaya Aaina

NEW DELHI: Former cricketer Basit Ali on Thursday came down heavily on the Pakistan cricket team after their disappointing performance against England on the fourth day of the Multan Test.Pakistan batters excelled in the opening two days of the Test, but England quickly seized control and maintained their dominance. Pakistan, trailing by 267 runs, then faced a tough challenge in the second innings, slumping to 82 for six on the penultimate day.As the top six batters failed to go past the 30-run mark, including Babar Azam , who was dismissed for 5, fans and pundits were left stunned by the batting collapse.Star Babar, who was hoping to regain form after a period of poor performances, was once again dismissed cheaply as his woeful run in the traditional format continued.Observing another below-par performance from Babar and other batters, Basit suggested it might be time for the 29-year-old to take a break. He emphasized that other players in a similar situation would have been dropped from the squad.""Babar Azam needs rest. Babar should say that I need to rest. It has been 18 innings since he has performed. If some other player was playing, then he would be out of the squad after three games, like Fawad Alam. This is the bitter truth,"" Basit said on his YouTube channel.While talking about the flaw in the former Pakistan skipper's technique, Basit expressed his frustration and added, ""Babar should reduce his stance. It is a lot now. The whole world is laughing. Is this how to play?""Basit then shifted his focus on Test skipper Shan Masood , reaffirmed his stance on the experienced southpaw to open and stated that he doesn't know how to captain the team.""I have been saying that Shan is an opener he should open. But he played at number three. Now, what will happen? Who will you drop? He should play at his number. He doesn't even know captaincy. What has happened to this cricket team? It is shameful,"" Basit added.The 454-run partnership between England's Harry Brook and Joe Root toppled numerous records on the fourth day and it forced Pakistan's back against the wall. Pakistan's heads dropped, and confidence went down as they waited for England to make its next move.England eventually declared on 823 for 7, putting Pakistan to bat in the final session. Pakistan ended the day with 152/6 on the board and still trailing by 115 runs.","Former cricketer Basit Ali came down heavily on the Pakistan cricket team after their disappointing performance against England.

Pellegrini sees red

A 94th-minute winner by Vangelis Pavlidis gave Greece a 2-1 victory on Thursday against England in a Nations League clash overshadowed by the death of Greek player George Baldock on the eve of the game, while Italy were held to a draw by Belgium.Greek striker Pavlidis netted a brace, either side of a late Jude Bellingham goal, to send Greece top of Group B2.Greece's first-ever victory against England came in an emotionally-charged evening at Wembley, which started with a minute's silence prior to kick-off for Baldock, an English-born Greece international who drowned in his swimming pool in Athens on Wednesday.""It was a really special day for us because of George. We are people and it's a special night because of him,"" Pavlidis told ITV.""A difficult moment for us because George was part of the team. Special guy. We have to play for him and it doesn't matter the score today. We gave everything for him.""The Greeks took a deserved lead in the 49th minute when Pavlidis danced through flimsy defending in the England box, before driving the ball past Jordan Pickford.The visitors had three disallowed goals in the match -- the last of which came just minutes before Real Madrid's Bellingham hammered in an 87th-minute equaliser for England.However, Greece were not to be denied a third win in three Nations League matches as England failed to clear the danger in their area and Pavlidis took full advantage and drilled home a late winner.In Group A2, Italy and Belgium played out an eventful 2-2 draw in Rome.The Italians raced into the lead inside 60 seconds when Andrea Cambiaso got his first international goal by bundling home from close range.Mateo Retegui doubled the hosts' lead on 24 minutes, sweeping home with his left foot after a spilled save.Italy looked comfortable and were dominating the encounter until they suffered a double blow inside the final 10 minutes of the first half.Lorenzo Pellegrini initially picked up a yellow card for his late lunge on Arthur Theate in the 38th minute but, after a VAR review, the Italy playmaker was instead shown a straight red.Belgium then duly halved the deficit from the resulting free-kick, with Maxim De Cuyper finishing emphatically from 25 yards following a clever set-piece move.Arsenal forward Leandro Trossard completed the Belgian comeback on 61 minutes.A deep corner was nodded back across goal and Trossard ghosted past the static defence to prod the ball past Gianluigi Donnarumma from close range.""There are episodes that can change a game, like their goal immediately after we went down to ten men,"" said Italy coach Luciano Spalletti.""A result doesn't always depend on the football you play and your tactics. Certainly, we could have played better in the second half after a very good first half.""Italy remain top of their group with France sitting second after they beat Israel 4-1 in Budapest.Eduardo Camavinga gave France a seventh-minute lead when the goalkeeper fumbled his tame effort, allowing the ball to bounce over the line.Omri Gandelman levelled on 24 minutes, before Christopher Nkunku restored France's advantage four minutes later with a sharp finish.As the clock wound down, the visitors added two more goals to their tally via Matteo Guendouzi and Bradley Barcola.Erling Haaland scored a brace as Norway eased past Slovenia 3-0 in Oslo to sit top of Group B3, three points ahead of Austria who beat Kazakhstan 4-0.Republic of Ireland came from behind in Helsinki to beat Finland 2-1, they sit third in Group B2 behind England.On Friday, Germany visit Bosnia and Herzegovina and Hungary host the Netherlands in Group A3, while Iceland take on Wales in Group B4.","Greece beat England 2-1 in a UEFA Nations League clash at Wembley.

Reports suggest Al Nassr's plea to move the game to Dubai as been approved.Similarly, Mohun Bagan’s participation in the AFC Champions League Two was halted when the Indian club declined to travel to Iran for their 2 October match against Tractor FC.Their refusal was driven by escalating security issues amid political unrest in Iran, notably after the passing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, which led to widespread protests and a five-day mourning period. The safety of players and officials was a paramount concern for the Indian team.Despite multiple requests to either reschedule the match or move it to a neutral venue, the AFC dismissed Mohun Bagan’s appeals. As a result, the AFC announced the club’s withdrawal from the tournament, nullifying all their matches. Many viewed this decision as an unjust penalty, particularly given the valid safety concerns raised by the team.The AFC’s handling of Mohun Bagan’s case raises concerns of bias and inconsistency in its decision-making processes.

PARIS: Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer 's rivalry started in the sweltering heat of Miami and ended almost two decades later in tears and hand-holding in an emotional London farewell.In between, the great friends met 40 times, battling out epics on European clay, London grass and hard courts from the United States to Australia.Nadal edged their head-to-head count 24-16, coming out 9-3 on top in Grand Slam finals including his stunning Wimbledon triumph in 2008, widely regarded as one of the greatest finals at the majors.However, the statistics only scratch the surface.""When Roger leaves the tour, an important part of my life is leaving too,"" admitted a tearful Nadal as he played Laver Cup doubles alongside 41-year-old Federer in the Swiss star's final appearance in September 2022.The two clasped hands as Federer hobbled into retirement.""Very proud to be part of his career but even for me happier to finish our career as friends after everything we shared on court as rivals,"" said Nadal.When Nadal equalled Federer's haul of 20 Grand Slam titles by lifting his 13th French Open in 2020, the Swiss described it as the ""greatest achievement in sport"".Federer never begrudged Nadal moving past him to 22 majors.""I can call up Rafa and talk about anything,"" said Federer at his emotional farewell in London.""We enjoy each other's company. We have a million topics to cover.

PARIS: Rafael Nadal announced his retirement from tennis after the Davis Cup finals in November on Thursday after a career which yielded 22 Grand Slam titles.Fourteen of those majors came at the French Open where he won 112 matches and suffered just four defeats since his 2005 debut.Here's a look at the Spaniard's 14 finals' triumphs in Paris:-- At just 19, Nadal became the youngest winner of a Grand Slam title since Michael Chang also at Roland Garros in 1989 at 17.He was the first man since Mats Wilander in 1982 to win the French Open on his debut. Puerta was to later fail a drugs test and handed an eight-year ban, eventually reduced to two years.-- Nadal became the first man to beat Federer in a Slam final, ending the Swiss star's hopes of holding all four majors at the same time. It was Nadal's 60th win in a row on clay.-- The 21-year-old Nadal became the first man since Bjorn Borg in 1980 to win three successive titles at Roland Garros.-- Nadal condemned his great rival to his worst ever loss in a Grand Slam event. The Spaniard also won the title without losing a set, becoming the third man to do so in the Open era after Ilie Nastase and Borg.-- Nadal avenged his defeat to the Swede at Roland Garros 12 months earlier. Again, Nadal finished the tournament without having dropped a set. He also regained the world number one ranking for the first time since July 2009.-- Nadal claimed his sixth French Open to equal the record of Borg, also taking his Slam total into double figures at 10. Federer had ended Novak Djokovic's 43-match undefeated run in the semi-finals.-- Nadal goes past Borg's record of six titles in Paris and ends Djokovic's bid to be the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four majors at the same time. Rain meant that the final was completed on Monday which was tough on Djokovic who was a break up in the fourth set when the match was halted on Sunday night.-- Nadal comfortably beats his compatriot for an eighth French Open but the hard yards were achieved in the semi-finals when he defeated Djokovic 6–4, 3–6, 6–1, 6–7, 9–7 in a 4-hour 37-minute epic.-- Title number nine in his ninth final for Nadal and his 14th Grand Slam success on an afternoon where temperatures nudged 30 degrees. It was his 45th career clay-court title.-- Nadal coasts to a record 10th French Open title, demolishing Wawrinka in a brutally one-sided final which also earns the Spaniard a 15th Grand Slam crown. Nadal, 31, becomes the first man in history to win the same major 10 times. It is his most one-sided final win since allowing Federer just four games in the 2008 final.-- Nadal moves to 17 Grand Slam titles with a straightforward victory over Thiem. Nadal endured a nervy conclusion to the final, however, when he needed treatment in the third set for a finger injury.-- Nadal overcomes dropping the second set by racing to victory over Thiem for the second successive year. The 33-year-old, seemingly angered by losing a set in the final for the first time since 2014, crushes the Austrian in the third and fourth sets to make it 12 titles and take his win-loss record at Roland Garros to a staggering 93-2.-- In a final played in front of a smattering of fans in a tournament delayed by four months due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Nadal demolishes Djokovic to win his 13th French Open and equal the all-time record of 20 Grand Slam titles held by Roger Federer who hailed the victory as ""one of sport's greatest achievements"".-- Nadal arrived at Roland Garros hampered by a left foot injury, despite having won his second Australian Open title earlier that year.He had to come through tough matches against Felix Auger-Aliassime, Djokovic and Alexander Zverev, but thrashed Norwegian Ruud in a one-sided final to become the oldest male Roland Garros champion.Nadal, 36, claimed his 112th match win at Roland Garros against just three defeats since his 2005 debut.","Rafael Nadal announced his retirement from tennis after the Davis Cup finals in November on Thursday.
