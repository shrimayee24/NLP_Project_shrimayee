Poll Do you believe Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma should continue playing ODIs until the 2027 World Cup? Yes, they should play. No, it's time to retire. Only if they are performing well.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is in no rush to make decisions about the ODI futures of cricket stars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , despite ongoing speculation. The matter has gained attention as India's next ODI series against Australia approaches in October, with questions arising about whether the duo, who have collectively scored 83 ODI hundreds and over 25,000 runs, can continue playing until the 2027 ODI World Cup.India's scheduled ODI series against Bangladesh in August has been canceled, making the Australia series from October 19-25 their next one-day international commitment.The age factor has become a significant talking point, as Kohli and Rohit would be 39 and 40 years old respectively by the 2027 ODI World Cup.""Obviously, if they (Rohit and Kohli) have something in mind, they would tell the BCCI brass like they did before the England Test tour. But from an Indian team's perspective, the next big assignment is the T20 World Cup in February and preparations before that. The immediate focus will be on sending the best team for the Asia Cup T20 tournament, hoping all players are fit and available,"" a BCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity.The BCCI is known for its measured approach to sensitive decisions, particularly considering the massive fan following of both players.The last tournament featuring both players was the Champions Trophy in Dubai, where Kohli scored a century against Pakistan in a group stage match, and Rohit contributed with a crucial half-century in the final.Neither player has participated in competitive cricket since the Indian Premier League concluded.Kohli, now residing in London, has shown signs of returning to training, posting an Instagram story of an indoor nets session.Rohit, who was also in the UK post-IPL, has returned to Mumbai and is expected to begin training soon.While some media outlets have reported about BCCI potentially offering the duo a farewell game in Sydney on October 25, the BCCI source indicated no such discussions have taken place yet.""Even if they play Vijay Hazare, before that there would already be six ODIs that will be played. In between the Australia ODIs and the South Africa ODIs, there is an India A series against South Africa A where three List A games (50 overs) will be held at Rajkot on November 13, 16 and 19 respectively.""""Now, will the duo want to play those three A games, or possibly two, before the South Africa series is the question. Even more important is whether Ajit Agarkar and his colleagues would want that,"" the source added.The national One-Day Championship, Vijay Hazare Trophy, is scheduled to begin on December 24, 2025, preceded by a three-match ODI series against South Africa starting November 30.""Overlapping the Vijay Hazare Trophy (December 24, 2025 - January 18, 2025) will be the three ODIs between India and New Zealand (January 11, 14, 18). So even if they play the Vijay Hazare Trophy, it can't be for more than two to three games,"" the source concluded.","Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have scored 83 ODI hundreds and over 25,000 runs. The duo would be 39 and 40 years old respectively by the 2027 ODI World Cup. India's scheduled ODI series against Bangladesh in August has been canceled.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123218480,imgsize-148776,width-400,resizemode-4/123218480.jpg"

A mother's instinct kicks in as symptoms spark a race against time

Inside the emergency room where doctors worked swiftly to stabilise baby Capri

Family turmoil, NFL commitments, and the one update fans needed to hear

Global fanbase rallies around the family as messages of support pour in

A late-night dash to the emergency room turned into a wave of relief for Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill’s family when his eight-month-old daughter, Capri, was admitted with sudden alarming symptoms. The little girl, shared with Hill’s estranged wife Keeta Vaccaro, had grown unusually warm, lethargic, and “not herself.” Quick-thinking calls and faster medical hands helped her bounce back, with doctors now calling her recovery a ‘positive turn’.Keeta Vaccaro shared the moment every parent dreads — the instant one knows something isn’t right. In her Instagram update, she described noticing Capri’s heavy eyes and warm skin before rushing to phone pediatrician Dr. Jared Friedman. Within minutes, hospital doors swung open and nurses had her baby hooked up for tests. “Last night was scary,” she admitted, her words carrying the weight of those anxious hours.Hospital photos showed Capri, wrapped in a light orange gown, clutching her blanket like a shield. Keeta thanked Dr. Friedman for calming her in the chaos, recalling his text: “We got this. We are a Team!” Blood work and viral panels were done swiftly, each step explained gently so a worried mother could breathe.By sunrise, Capri’s temperature had settled, and she was responding to treatment with more alertness and strength.The scare comes just months after Keeta filed for divorce in April, with Capri’s November 2024 birth marking a bright chapter in an otherwise turbulent year. Hill, sidelined from a Dolphins practice by an undisclosed injury, has not confirmed if he was at the ER. Still, Capri’s life has been well documented on Keeta’s feed — from six-month milestones to Sunday church visits — proof that love can remain the anchor when life turns rough.As Keeta’s post spread, thousands of followers jumped in to comfort her. “Glad she is ok!” one wrote, while another shared, “Oh no!!! I’m glad she is feeling better!” A third simply said, “Thank God she’s ok.” For many parents, it was a story that hit home — that late-night terror, the helpless waiting, the relief of seeing your child smile again.From a panic-filled midnight to a hopeful morning, Capri’s quick recovery has become the only headline that matters for the Hills. And for those who have followed Keeta’s journey, the sight of her daughter resting peacefully is more than news — it’s a shared moment of gratitude. In times like this, the power of family love and the kindness of a supportive community feel more real than ever. Across the globe, fans continue to send prayers and warm wishes, reminding the young family they're not alone in this fight.Although Tyreek Hill and Keeta Vaccaro are separated and navigating a difficult divorce, their shared love for Capri remains the unbreakable bond that keeps them connected as family above all else. In every whispered prayer and hopeful glance toward the future, that love shines through- reminding us all that even in hardship, family endures.And for Keeta, that night will forever be proof that a mother's strength rises highest when her child needed her most. For Tyreek, it was a quiet remainder that fatherhood's truest measure came in moments of presence and care. Capri's smile the next morning was perhaps the clearest sign yet that brighter days were on their way- and that both her parents, despite everything, would always stand guard over her heart. In that shared love, they found a fragile but unbreakable hope that would guide them through whatever lay ahead.Together, they learned that love, even in its quietest forms, holds the power to heal wounds, mend fears, and light the darkest paths with unwavering faith. And in that simple truth, they discovered a strength deeper than any hardship-a love fierce enough to carry them through every storm. Their bond stood strong, a light through every storm.Also read: Disney’s ESPN strikes landmark deal to buy NFL Network — league grabs 10% stake in blockbuster swap","Tyreek Hill's daughter, Capri, rushed to ER with 'unusual' symptoms.

Launching a podcast that turns vulnerability into collective connection

Creating ripples beyond the game with films and representation

Kylie Kelce isn’t settling for the sidelines. Married to Philadelphia Eagles legend Jason Kelce, she’s stepping into her own arena—where motherhood meets empowerment, sports meets self-worth, and authenticity meets action. Her “Not Gonna Lie” podcast and advocacy work signal a shift in how women in her position can lead. This isn’t just celebrity—it’s real influence, redefined.Kylie refuses to be reduced to a plus-one. “If you’re going to talk about me, you should talk about things that matter,” she insists—shaping public attention around substance over spectacle.

For her, visibility in the NFL spotlight isn’t vanity—it’s influence.Her “Not Gonna Lie” podcast wasn’t born from comfort—it was a leap. She admits, “It was terrifying letting people into my world,” yet she leaned into that fear to spark honest dialogue.

She’s producing Fans of Confidence, a short film that flips the fan-athlete script by having professional players cheer for young girls on the field.

Photo by Chris Jackson/Getty Images for Buckingham Palace





Princess Anne is marking her 75th with a fresh look and a familiar sparkle. A new portrait released ahead of her birthday shows the Princess Royal standing with her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence. The image was taken before the French state banquet at Windsor Castle in July.The first thing people will notice is her hair. Anne has worn a similar bouffant style for about five decades. In this portrait she switches to a smooth chignon. It is elegant, neat, and suits the formal setting. The change is rare for her, which is why the photo drew quick attention.The second talking point is the tiara. Anne chose the Festoon Tiara, a long-time favorite in her rotation. She received it as a gift in 1973 after christening a ship for the Worldwide Shipping Group. The design sits low and balanced, which works well with the new hair. Together they create a cleaner frame around her face.The portrait also doubles as a quiet nod to partnership. Sir Tim stands with her, as he often does at major state events. The two married in 1992 and keep a low profile. Their presence together in the birthday image sets a warm tone as family plans take shape for the coming weeks.There is context behind the timing. The palace shared the photo one week before her August 15 birthday to start the celebrations. It was shot by royal photographer Chris Jackson. He captured it at Windsor before the banquet held for the French state visit from July 8 to 10. The result is formal but relaxed, a look that fits Anne’s usual style.Fashion notes aside, the image also lands after a busy and challenging year. Anne remains one of the most active working royals by engagement count. Last year she briefly stepped back after a horse-related incident near her home. She returned to duties and later said the experience was a reminder that each day is a bonus. The new portrait, bright and composed, underlines that message without a single word.Reactions so far focus on two themes. Many like seeing a small style reset that still feels like Anne. Others appreciate the continuity of the Festoon Tiara, a piece linked to her early twenties and worn across decades. It is a simple mix of new and old. That balance is what people expect from her.As the birthday week begins, more pictures and appearances are likely. For now, one frame does the job. New hair. A classic tiara. Her husband at her side. It is a quiet portrait that still says a lot about how Anne works, dresses, and shows up for the role she has held for most of her life.","Princess Anne is marking her 75th with a fresh look and a familiar sparkle.

"NHL Trade Rumors: Montreal Canadiens eye Mason McTavish, but Anaheim Ducks’ asking price for star center is steep",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-montreal-canadiens-eye-mason-mctavish-but-anaheim-ducks-asking-price-for-star-center-is-steep/articleshow/123244737.cms,"Ric Tapia/GettyImages

Anaheim Ducks set high asking price for Mason McTavish, targeting Canadiens prospect David Reinbacher

Why Mason McTavish could be the perfect addition to the Montreal Canadiens’ roster

Trade chatter is swirling around Anaheim Ducks center Mason McTavish, with the Montreal Canadiens emerging as a frequent link. While Ducks general manager Pat Verbeek has made it clear he wants to keep the 22-year-old, reports indicate he’s open to moving McTavish if the return is right. That return, however, comes with a high price tag, one that could force Montreal into a tough decision.According to multiple reports, including Jimmy Murphy’s, Verbeek would only consider parting with McTavish for a young, right-handed defenseman capable of playing in a top-four role immediately, with the potential to grow into a first-pairing cornerstone.Within the Canadiens’ system, that description points directly to David Reinbacher, the fifth overall pick in the 2023 NHL Draft. The 20-year-old is widely viewed as Montreal’s top defense prospect and a key part of their future blue line.The Ducks’ reported request is straightforward, Reinbacher for McTavish — but it’s a steep cost for the Habs, who have been cautious about moving their top young assets.McTavish, 22, stands 6-foot-2, weighs 220 pounds, and plays a strong two-way game. Selected third overall by Anaheim in 2021, he has already compiled 140 points in 229 NHL games, including 60 goals.Last season, he tallied 52 points in 76 games, often in a third-line role and with limited power play time, suggesting even more offensive upside.For Montreal, McTavish would slot perfectly as a second-line center behind Nick Suzuki, giving the team a reliable scoring threat and added size down the middle. His combination of skill, strength, and playoff-style play makes him an appealing target, but surrendering Reinbacher could leave a long-term hole on the right side of their defense.The McTavish-to-Montreal speculation highlights a classic NHL trade dilemma, balancing the allure of an NHL-ready young star against the value of a blue-chip prospect. While McTavish could address an immediate need for the Canadiens, Anaheim’s high asking price ensures this deal, if it ever happens, will require serious consideration from both sides. Until then, the trade rumors are likely to remain a hot topic.Also Read: Rasmus Andersson breaks silence on Calgary Flames trade rumors, contract status, and offseason speculation","Anaheim Ducks set high asking price for Mason McTavish, targeting Canadiens prospect David Reinbacher.

Themay not be done making moves this offseason. While some believe their roster is set, others think another trade could be in the works to push them closer to championship contention.SB Nation’s Jacob Rude recently laid out three potential trade scenarios that could boost the Los Angeles Lakers ’ chances, including one involving Dillon Brooks.As Rude explained: “From a fan favorite to a villain of the fans. Dillon Brooks immediately became the target of the fans during the Lakers’ series against the Grizzlies, one that went terribly for him. He antagonized LeBron before the playoffs, then spent the series ducking reporters and getting ejected from games.”Dillon Brooks has built a reputation as one of the league’s most polarizing figures. His antics during the Lakers-Grizzlies playoff series turned him into a target for fans. However, Lakers history shows that villains can become allies - Ron Artest, Matt Barnes, and Dwight Howard all managed to redeem themselves after joining the team.• Elite Wing Defense: Brooks is widely regarded as one of the best wing defenders in the NBA.• Capable Scorer: While streaky, he can deliver big offensive performances.• Controlled Role: Likely to come off the bench for the Lakers, giving the team a quick hook if his on-court antics resurface.At present, the move appears unlikely. The Phoenix Suns , who landed Brooks in the Kevin Durant trade, have expressed no desire to move him. In addition, the proposed offer of Gabe Vincent and Maxi Kleber is unlikely to be enough to convince them.If the Los Angeles Lakers were willing to include one or two first-round picks, the Suns might reconsider - especially if they decide to pivot toward a rebuild. In that scenario, Dillon Brooks could be pried away from Phoenix.Also read: NBA Trade News: Los Angeles Clippers Sign $11.4 Million Golden State Warriors Star Forward in Pre-Season Roster Shakeup Pairing Brooks with both Luka Doncic and LeBron James could create a formidable combination of defensive grit and offensive potential.

Ben Simmons’ Fit and Performance Concerns

Strategic Priorities for Los Angeles

The’ rumored pursuit ofremains nothing more than speculation, with multiple financial, roster, and strategic roadblocks making a deal highly improbable.Ben Simmons’ $33 million-plus salary is the biggest stumbling block. Under NBA trade rules, the Los Angeles Lakers - already a luxury tax team - must send out comparable salaries to acquire him. With LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook on massive contracts, matching Simmons’ deal would require trading away multiple key role players and minimum-salary pieces, effectively gutting the roster. Moving a core star to make the numbers work is unrealistic, and Philadelphia is unlikely to settle for lesser assets.Even if the finances lined up, the Los Angeles Lakers face another roadblock: roster capacity. With 15 players under contract, they can’t add anyone until at least January 18 unless they waive or trade a player. This leaves no immediate pathway to bring Simmons on board.Beyond logistics, Simmons’ recent track record raises doubts. While he’s still an elite defender and strong playmaker, his scoring limitations and lack of shooting could worsen the Lakers’ existing floor-spacing issues.Injuries and inconsistent performances in recent seasons further diminish his appeal.T he Lakers have reportedly explored more attainable targets, such as Jerami Grant, who comes with a smaller contract and fewer health concerns. Maintaining roster balance, preserving cap flexibility, and avoiding high-risk moves remain the front office’s focus - factors that push a Simmons deal far down the priority list.A Los Angeles Lakers-Simmons pairing faces too many obstacles: an unworkable salary match, no open roster spots, fit concerns, and competing priorities. While the idea may spark fan debates, the practical reality is that Simmons is unlikely to wear purple and gold anytime soon.In the end, the Lakers’ connection to Ben Simmons feels more like a headline than a realistic plan. With financial hurdles, roster limits, and on-court fit concerns all stacked against the move, Los Angeles seems destined to keep exploring safer, more practical options rather than chasing an improbable blockbuster.Also read: NBA Trade News: Los Angeles Clippers Sign $11.4 Million Golden State Warriors Star Forward in Pre-Season Roster Shakeup Let us know in the comments if you think Simmons would have been a good addition to the Lakers roster.","The Los Angeles Lakers have been linked with a move for Philadelphia 76ers star Ben Simmons.

Dave Portnoy slams Hailee Steinfeld ’s ‘ Sinners ’

NFL rivalry spills into Hollywood chatter

A personal story behind the supernatural

Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy is known for pulling no punches, and his latest target is Sinners—the gothic vampire drama starring Hailee Steinfeld , wife of Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen. More than three months after its April 18 premiere, Portnoy made it clear he wasn’t buying into the hype.Portnoy told followers on X (formerly Twitter) that he had intended to watch the much-anticipated thriller Weapons, only to discover it wasn’t available to stream. Instead, he settled on Sinners, directed by Ryan Coogler and set in 1930s Mississippi, with Steinfeld playing a multi-racial vampire opposite Michael B. Jordan.“I may be like 6 months late with this critique but that was one of the most overhyped, overrated movies of all time. If you say that movie was great, you have no movie credibility with me,” Portnoy tweeted, leaving little doubt about his verdict.The criticism comes well past the film’s promotional run, but the blunt delivery reignited conversation—especially since Allen had publicly praised his wife’s performance earlier this year, calling the film “fantastic” during a team media appearance.Not all NFL voices shared Allen’s glowing review. New York Jets cornerback Sauce Gardner jokingly declared in April, “out of respect for my dawg Josh, i will not be going to see Sinners,” adding a playful twist to the inter-division rivalry.Allen, coming off an MVP-caliber season with over 3,700 passing yards and 40 total touchdowns, married Steinfeld on May 31 in a celebration he called “the best night of my life” on HBO’s Hard Knocks. The couple’s high-profile status in both sports and entertainment has made Sinners a talking point well beyond the usual moviegoing crowd.Director Ryan Coogler has said the idea for Sinners stemmed from family stories and Mississippi blues history, weaving in a supernatural twist with Michael B. Jordan playing twin brothers navigating post-World War I life. For Steinfeld, the role was deeply personal, connecting to her own heritage while tackling a complex, genre-bending character.Also Read: Josh Allen spotted on romantic Buffalo date night with Hailee Steinfeld after missing Bills' pre-season opener loss Whether Portnoy’s critique is an outlier or a sign of broader backlash, one thing is certain: in the NFL-Hollywood crossover space, even movie reviews can turn into headline-grabbing drama.","Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy slammed Hailee Steinfeld's film 'Sinners' Allen had publicly praised his wife’s performance earlier this year.

Tyreek Hill’s injury absence magnifies Dolphins’ offensive weaknesses

NFL teams circling as Dolphins’ situation grows tense

As the Miami Dolphins gear up for the upcoming NFL season, the future of star wide receiver Tyreek Hill remains one of the league’s hottest talking points. While the Dolphins maintain they have “no intention” of trading the All-Pro receiver, persistent injuries and recent on-field struggles are keeping trade speculation alive — and NFL teams are watching closely.During joint practices with the Chicago Bears, Miami’s offense, led by quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, looked disjointed without Hill on the field. Known for his unmatched speed and ability to stretch defenses, Hill’s absence due to an oblique injury was felt immediately.Offensive line captain Terron Armstead admitted the void was significant, explaining that Hill’s ability to pull defenders and create openings is a cornerstone of Miami’s playbook. Without him, the offense lacked rhythm, and Chicago’s defense exploited those gaps with ease.The impact of Hill’s absence was most visible in Tua’s performance. After a steady camp with only one interception, Tagovailoa threw three picks against the Bears in a single session. Chicago’s defensive tactic of crowding the middle exposed Miami’s lack of explosiveness on the perimeter — a role Hill normally dominates.Despite Miami’s firm public stance, multiple NFL teams are reportedly monitoring the situation, ready to pounce if the Dolphins reconsider. Hill’s unique ability to change a game with a single play makes him a highly coveted asset, and his trade value could soar if Miami’s offense continues to sputter.If Hill’s injury lingers or if the Dolphins’ offense stalls early in the season, front office pressure could mount to explore offers. Miami has hinted that it would take a “significant package” to move Hill, but the right deal could change everything.Also Read: ""All he wants to do...""

Dolphins face backfield challenge and offensive balance test without Alexander Mattison



Miami Dolphins running back Alexander Mattison will miss the entire 2025 NFL season after undergoing season-ending neck surgery in Chicago. The injury, sustained during a preseason matchup against the Chicago Bears, is a major blow to Miami’s backfield depth heading into the regular season.According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, Mattison was hurt during Sunday’s preseason game and immediately taken to a nearby hospital for evaluation. What initially appeared to be minor neck and shoulder soreness quickly escalated in severity, leading to emergency surgery later that evening. The procedure effectively rules him out for the remainder of the year.The news comes as a surprise given Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel’s post-game comments. Speaking to reporters, McDaniel noted that Mattison was “doing well” and mentioned only experiencing some neck and shoulder soreness, suggesting that further updates would follow in the coming days. Unfortunately for Miami, the follow-up update confirmed the worst-case scenario.Mattison, who joined the Dolphins to add veteran stability and power running to the offense, was expected to play a key role in short-yardage and red-zone situations.His absence now forces the team to reconfigure its running back rotation before the season opener.With Mattison sidelined, the Dolphins will lean heavily on De’Von Achane, whose speed and versatility make him a dangerous weapon in space. Rookie Jaylen Wright and first-year back Ollie Gordon will also see increased opportunities to prove themselves in training camp and preseason action.In addition, the Dolphins are bringing in veteran Jamaal Williams for a workout, signaling the team’s intent to bolster depth with experienced talent. Williams, known for his physical running style and reliable goal-line production, could be a strong fit to replace Mattison’s role.For Miami, the loss of Mattison is not just about depth; it’s about maintaining offensive balance. The Dolphins’ high-powered passing attack led by Tua Tagovailoa and Tyreek Hill thrives when complemented by a consistent ground game. Finding a replacement capable of handling the physical demands of the position will be crucial for sustaining their offensive rhythm.Also Read: Cam Miller’s stunning Raiders debut triggers calls to move on from Aidan O’Connell While Mattison begins his recovery journey, the Dolphins’ coaching staff faces the challenge of reshaping the backfield and ensuring the team remains competitive in a tough AFC East.",Miami Dolphins running back Alexander Mattison will miss the entire 2025 NFL season.

Adis Beciragic, the coach of Bosnia and Herzegovina, has recently criticized his team's lack of fitness ahead of EuroBasket . He also singled out Jusuf Nurkic and Xavier Castaneda. After heavy losses to China, Serbia, and Montenegro, a difficult group consisting of Georgia, Greece, Italy, and Spain has caused concern for the team. Additionally, this criticism came days after their EuroBasket 2025 preparations, when Nikola Jokic and Serbia's national team dominated Bosnia and Herzegovina and won.The EuroBasket preparation matches for Bosnia and Herzegovina are reportedly becoming worse. Montenegro, which has dominated from the start, defeated the national squad. Meanwhile, head coach Adis Beciragic did not attempt to hide his frustration after the game as he brought up his players' fitness problems.Regarding the NBA center, who scored 15 points during his team's most recent losing performance, the coach said:“[Jusuf] Nurkic is out of shape and can barely run.”He further said:“Xavier Castaneda is not training, he only started playing five-on-five two days ago. All that needs to be integrated into a team that has played together for two years.”According to Adis Beciragic, the team has reportedly not been prepared to the necessary degree. He then said:“We have to prepare better for the games.We missed 18 free throws against Serbia. Montenegro is also a very good team and I hope we will be able to convince the players to understand where the problems are.”This happened after the team faced a tragic loss. Meanwhile, last week, Jusuf Nurkic joined the Bosnia and Herzegovina squad together with Dzanan Musa. He then said that he is in decent shape.Talking about it, he added:“I’m coming in decent shape, but training and games are not the same. I think we’re all around the same level in terms of fitness, and we’ll gradually improve it. What’s important is that we stay healthy and arrive at EuroBasket healthy – that’s very important, probably the most important thing.”According to Jusuf Nurkic, this team is prepared to create history.“Time has shown that we are a team capable of achieving results, but whether it’s Murphy’s law or something else, I don’t know, we’ve had so many setbacks so many times. However, I’m sure – God willing, with good health – that now we have a historic opportunity to achieve a great result.”On the other hand, the team is now preparing to face Spain, Italy, Greece , and Georgia.Also read: Is Giannis Antetokounmpo going to miss EuroBasket 2025 Prep Games?

Who is Georgina Rodriguez? Everything that we know about her humble beginnings and rise to fame



How many children does Christiano Ronaldo have with Georgina?





What does Georgina do currently?







How did Christiano meet Georgina: The love-story that stood the test of time







Social media revelation of the engagement that is taking the internet by storm



Stop the presses: Georgina Rodríguez has just confirmed what fans have been whispering for years — she and Cristiano Ronaldo are engaged. The model and influencer posted a close-up of her hand on Instagram, the enormous diamond ring glinting as if to shout the news from every rooftop: “Yes I do. In this and in all my lives.” The moment has been picked up across the globe, and love-it-or-loathe-it commentators are already calling it the social-media wedding of the year. This is the fairy-tale-with-a-footballer vibe that reads like a glossy romcom — except it’s real life, live on Instagram, and the ring is reportedly colossal.But who is Georgina beyond the headline bling? From humble Spanish beginnings to high-fashion campaigns and a Netflix docuseries, Georgina Rodríguez has been quietly — then very loudly — building a life in the spotlight alongside one of football’s biggest icons. Here’s the lowdown on the woman who’s been Ronaldo’s partner since 2016, the mother who shepherds a blended brood, and the influencer-turned-businesswoman who now runs her own brand of glamour.Born in Argentina and raised in Jaca, Spain, Georgina trained in dance as a child and moved to Madrid as a young adult where she worked ordinary jobs to make ends meet. One of those jobs — a sales assistant role at a Gucci store — proved to be fate.It was there, according to multiple accounts, that she first met Cristiano Ronaldo in 2016; the encounter quickly turned romantic and public by 2017. Over the years, Georgina parlayed her visibility into a modeling and influencer career, appearing in campaigns and on magazine covers, and even launching product collaborations and an athleisure line. She’s also the star and producer of the Netflix show I Am Georgina, which helped cement her global profile.Family is Georgina’s headline role off camera. Together, she and Ronaldo parent several children — including their daughter Alana Martina and younger daughter Bella Esmeralda — and Georgina is a stepmother to Ronaldo’s older children, including Cristiano Jr. The couple endured public heartbreak in 2022 when their newborn son, Ángel, died at birth; they announced the tragedy openly and received waves of public support. Today the household is famously close-knit, globe-trotting between Ronaldo’s football commitments and wealthy lifestyles in Europe and Saudi Arabia after Ronaldo’s move to Al-Nassr. Georgina’s Instagram often reads like a family scrapbook — staged, glossy, but unmistakably intimate.These days Georgina is more than “the WAG.” She is a fashion face for major brands (she’s appeared in campaigns and on runways), an entrepreneur with product tie-ins, and a social media powerhouse with tens of millions of followers. Her Netflix series showed both the glamour and the pressure of life under the microscope — weddings, fashion weeks, charity events, and personal grief have all been part of the narrative. Georgina has also lent her profile to philanthropy, especially causes linked to children’s welfare and education, using her platform to amplify campaigns and donations.The story that reads like a screenplay: a pretty saleswoman at a luxury store meets the world’s most-recognized footballer. Sparks flew, public appearances began in earnest in early 2017, and the relationship matured into parenthood and partnership through some of Ronaldo’s biggest career moves — Real Madrid, Juventus, Manchester United (return) and now Al-Nassr. Ronaldo has been candid in interviews about waiting for “that click” to propose; apparently, the click came — and the ring followed.Georgina’s Instagram reveal — a photo of her hand on Ronaldo’s with a showstopping oval/emerald-style diamond — lit up feeds and tabloids. Commentators debated the carat count and the price tag, while fans celebrated. Whether this will lead to an over-the-top televised wedding, a discreet family-only ceremony, or a multi-day destination blowout is anyone’s guess — but you can bet the fashion houses and event planners are already circling.In a world where celebrity romances can flicker and fade, Georgina Rodríguez and Cristiano Ronaldo have quietly — and now unmistakably — turned nine years of partnership into an engagement that reads like both a triumph and a public milestone. Georgina’s journey from a dancer in Jaca to a Gucci sales assistant, to a global model, mother, and media figure, is the kind of modern rags-to-red-carpet story tabloids live for. But beyond the sparkle, the engagement also spotlights a family that’s weathered joy and devastating loss in full view of the cameras. Expect more glossy snapshots, more headline-making fashion moments, and — almost certainly — a wedding that will dominate feeds. For now, the world watches as Georgina and Cristiano step into their next act: official fiancée and fiancé, ready for whatever the spotlight and life throws next.","Georgina Rodríguez has confirmed she and Cristiano Ronaldo are engaged.

Rucker Park’s rich streetball legacy will live on through NBA great



How Julius Erving and others brought Rucker’s style to the NBA

Also Read:

Once again, the legendary Rucker Park basketball court sprang alive on a nice Harlem evening. Celebrated for molding legends such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , Wilt Chamberlain, and Julius Erving, the court still carries a great legacy. Though now a symbol of basketball culture, it was once the setting for streetball excellence. Today, it keeps the spirit of its golden years alive in New York City by motivating young players.On a warm summer evening in Harlem, New York, Marvin “Hammer” Stevens sat under a small tent near the baseline of Rucker Park. He watched a youth streetball game with focus. The court sits at 155th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard. It has been a landmark in basketball culture for many years. Now, it mostly hosts local summer leagues and community tournaments. But decades ago, it was a place for basketball legends.In the 1960s and 1970s, Rucker Park saw some of the biggest names in the game. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, then known as Lew Alcindor, Wilt Chamberlain, and Willis Reed, played there in its early years.By the early 1970s, the court became a battleground for stars like Julius “Dr.J” Erving, Nate “Tiny” Archibald, Pee Wee Kirkland, Joe “The Destroyer” Hammond, and Stevens himself.Stevens, now reflecting on those times, told The New York Post, “When we played, this was all different… No comparison.” The stands were packed, the energy unmatched, and the style of play was fast, fearless, and often improvised, the kind of basketball that would influence the NBA for decades.Julius Erving had just completed his second year at the University of Massachusetts during the summer of 1971. NCAA regulations at the time prohibited dunking, therefore restricting his capacity to display his athleticism. He joined the Rucker Pro League that summer under the direction of sportswriter Peter Vecsey, playing for the Westsiders.Vecsey, inspired by Pete Axthelm’s 1970 book The City Game, convinced league officials Bob McCullough and Freddie Crawford to let him coach a team. He secured $300 from New York Nets owner Roy Boe and recruited Erving through a meeting at the park. Erving agreed to play without pay, telling Vecsey after a walk with his close friend Dave Brownbill, “OK. Let’s go.”Dr. J would go on to play at Rucker for five summers, later joining the Virginia Squires in the ABA and then the Philadelphia 76ers after the 1976 NBA-ABA merger. He credited Rucker for sharpening his creativity, pace, and confidence, saying, “It was like the chains coming off… We weren’t worried about what the coach had to say.”Kobe Bryant in 2002 and Kevin Durant in 2011 were among the few modern stars to play at Rucker Park. These days, NBA players rarely step onto outdoor courts because of injury risks. Even so, the place still carries the spirit of its best years. Local games often have live DJs and emcees, bringing energy and keeping the crowd excited.","Rucker Park in Harlem, New York, was once the setting for streetball excellence. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and Julius Erving played there in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, it mostly hosts local summer leagues and community tournaments.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123244622,imgsize-496002,width-400,resizemode-4/123244622.jpg"

Inside the Jerry Jones–Micah Parsons contract fallout



Cowboys’ standoff with Micah Parsons reaches dangerous standstill

The Dallas Cowboys are staring down a crisis as star linebacker Micah Parsons publicly demands a trade. Once the face of the defense and a driving force behind Dallas’ Super Bowl hopes, Parsons’ close bond with owner Jerry Jones has soured, turning contract negotiations into a full-blown offseason standoff.Parsons’ trade request, delivered to Stephen Jones, sent shockwaves through the NFL. The 2021 Defensive Rookie of the Year and multi-time All-Pro has 52.5 sacks since entering the league — numbers that make him one of the most dominant defensive players in football. But this dispute isn’t just about money.ESPN’s Dan Orlovsky says the tension “feels personal,” pointing to the Cowboys’ decision to bypass Parsons’ agent and deal directly with the player, along with reported criticism of his injury record and character. These moves fractured a relationship that once seemed unshakable. Even teammate CeeDee Lamb has backed Parsons, but “Pay Micah” chants have gone unanswered.Since Parsons’ announcement, there’s been no meaningful contact between the two sides. Adam Schefter reports “no deal in sight” and confirms the Cowboys have neither advanced contract talks nor entertained trade discussions. Dallas insists it has “no intention” of moving him, yet has made no effort to secure his future.Jerry Jones is no stranger to playing the waiting game with stars like Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb, but Parsons’ case is more volatile. By citing disrespect and a refusal to negotiate without his agent, Parsons has drawn a hard line, one Jones seems unwilling to cross.Losing Parsons would devastate Dallas’ defense. Without his game-changing pass rush, the unit’s dominance crumbles, and the Cowboys’ playoff hopes fade. More than just a player, Parsons is a locker room leader and lifelong Cowboys fan now on the brink of leaving the franchise entirely.Also Read: Alexander Mattison injury update: Dolphins RB out for season after neck surgery, major blow to backfield plans The Cowboys face a defining choice: repair the once-strong bond between Jerry Jones and Micah Parsons or risk losing their defensive cornerstone.

Contract standoff leaves Jonathan Kuminga ’s future with the Golden State Warriors uncertain ahead of 2025-26 season

As the contract standoff continues into the new NBA season, Jonathan Kuminga of the Golden State Warriors, is reportedly not looking for a team-friendly deal with the team. According to Anthony Slater, the star would rather accept a $7.9 million one-year qualifying offer than the G.S. Warriors' two-year, $45 million contract with a team option. This made his future in the NBA kind of uncertain.The majority of the teams are finalizing their rosters as the 2025-2026 NBA season approaches. However, Jonathan Kuminga is one of the few free agents still available. The young star is still far from coming to an agreement with the franchise, but he is getting more and more specific about what he wants.Anthony Slater of ESPN claimed that the youngster’s status with the team hasn't changed much in recent times. His position on Golden State's two-year, $45 million deal remains unchanged. He further reported:“So, everything sits in the same spot it did 10 days ago. The Warriors have not upped their offer, and Kuminga has indicated to those close to him that the $7.9 million qualifying offer is more appealing to him than the Warriors' current pitch. Something has to give before the Oct. 1 deadline.”According to insiders, the Golden State Warriors first offered Jonathan Kuminga's team a tradeable contract. It would reportedly eventually satisfy both parties' long-term desires when he becomes available for another transfer in January.However, the NBA player has stated that he is not open to a team-friendly agreement. He even declines to sign a deal that would restrict his autonomy over his own career or make him more easily marketable in the middle of the season.On the other hand, the G.S. Warriors have rejected his agent's offer of a three-year, $82 million contract. According to Jake Fischer of The Stein Line, in addition to a higher salary, the NBA reportedly wants more media attention and a bigger part in the team's structure.The insider also said:""But Golden State, sources say, is not open to amending its stance on the second year of the two-year, $45 million offer it has extended to the 22-year-old swingman… The Warriors are insistent that Year 2 is a team option; Kuminga would naturally prefer a player option.""Hence, the NBA icon hasn’t finalized anything as his NBA future hangs in balance.Also read: Jonathan Kuminga draws sign-and-trade interest from Phoenix Suns and Sacramento Kings, delays Golden State Warriors deal","Jonathan Kuminga is one of the few free agents still available in the NBA.

Lakers turned down trade involving Gabe Vincent and Jarred Vanderbilt

Los Angeles Lakers’ cautious offseason approach

Also Read:

The Los Angeles Lakers have been linked to many stories this summer. From superstar names to small roster changes, the team has stayed in the headlines. There has also been talk of moves they could have made but didn’t. A recent report now reveals one choice the Lakers turned down as they prepare for the 2025–26 NBA season.On Monday, August 11, NBA insider Sean Deveney of Athlon Sports reported that the Lakers had the chance to trade away guard Gabe Vincent and forward Jarred Vanderbilt this offseason. Both players were regulars in the rotation last year.Gabe Vincent joined the Lakers in July 2023 after leaving the Miami Heat. Last season, he averaged 6.4 points per game and had one year left on an $11.5 million deal. Jarred Vanderbilt arrived in February 2023 from the Utah Jazz. Known for his defense, he played only 36 games last season due to injury.Deveney’s report says rival teams asked the Lakers to include Vincent and Vanderbilt in trade talks. The Lakers declined, keeping both players for now. These talks reportedly happened earlier in the summer before training camp.Sean Deveney said the Lakers look almost complete right now and are not planning big trades before the season begins.It seems the choice came from the team’s own management, who want to watch how the roster plays together first, before deciding on any major changes.In July 2025, the Lakers added center Deandre Ayton after he left the Portland Trail Blazers. They also signed veteran guard Marcus Smart. Even LeBron James was mentioned in trade speculation earlier this summer, but no deal happened.One Western Conference executive told Yardbarker, “They have not been attacking the trade market by any stretch of the imagination.” The Lakers appear to believe their current roster can compete as it is.Jarred Vanderbilt’s defensive skills and Gabe Vincent’s playoff experience are seen as valuable. Both players also hold mid-level salaries that could be used in future trades if needed. By not moving them now, the Lakers keep flexibility for later in the season, such as around the trade deadline.Training camp begins in late September 2025 in Los Angeles. The regular season tips off in October. Until then, the Lakers are keeping both Vincent and Vanderbilt on the roster and watching how the team develops.",Lakers turned down trade involving Gabe Vincent and Jarred Vanderbilt.

Tom Brady believes recruiting and roster chaos could be Belichick’s real test at UNC

Tom Brady on Player Development, Belichick at UNC & his First Year in TV | Big Noon Conversations

Experts split on whether Bill Belichick can actually pull it off



Bill Belichick coaching in college still feels like one of those “did that really happen?” headlines, and now Tom Brady has entered the chat. The seven-time Super Bowl champ hopped onand gave his two cents on why his old coach’s leap to the NCAA might be trickier than anyone expected and spoiler alert, it’s not about X’s and O’s. It’s about people.In his chat with Joel Klatt on, Brady pointed out that Belichick’s dominance in the NFL came in a totally different environment, one where rosters are stable and contracts keep players around. In college? Roster turnover can be wild, with the transfer portal and NIL deals flipping teams overnight. That means Belichick won’t just be drawing up plays, he’ll be selling his program to teenagers and their families constantly.Several analysts are already voicing doubts. ESPN’s Tom Luginbill and former NFL linebacker Sam Acho both say that Belichick’s strict NFL-style culture might not work unless he lands a quarterback like Tom Brady. In the pros, you can mold a locker room over years. In college, you might lose half your starters in a single offseason. Building “culture” becomes a sprint, not a marathon.Joel Klatt himself says predicting Belichick’s first season at UNC is a “fool’s errand” because so much depends on transfer portal success.He’s cautiously optimistic, though he thinks UNC could win 6–8 games if Belichick focuses on fundamentals and adjusts to the college system fast. Others see this as high-risk, high-reward territory.Brady admitted he never saw this move coming and called it “blowing me away.” But he also praised Belichick’s insane work ethic and ability to inspire, even if the grind of recruiting, NIL negotiations, and constant roster changes is totally foreign to him.Belichick’s name alone brings attention, recruits, and national coverage to Chapel Hill. But as Brady made clear, it’s not enough to just show up with rings, you have to win the trust of young players who could leave at any time. If Belichick cracks that code, UNC might be in for something special. If not, this could be one of the most fascinating “what ifs” in football history.Also read - Taylor Swift fans spot big new hints she’s the mystery New Heights guest",Tom Brady believes recruiting and roster chaos could be Belichick’s real test at UNC.

Play at the Cincinnati Open was temporarily suspended on Monday due to a local power outage that affected both match operations and television broadcasts. The suspension occurred around 5pm local time when broadcast channels lost their court camera feeds, and matches had to be halted due to the inability to use electronic line calling systems, which are mandatory for ATP Tour events.The power outage impacted several ongoing matches, including Taylor Fritz's contest against Lorenzo Sonego and Benjamin Bonzi's match against Stefanos Tsitsipas. Multiple doubles matches were also in progress when the suspension was announced.The tournament officially addressed the situation through their social media channels, stating: ""Due to an on-site power outage, play is currently suspended.""Tennis pundit Gigi Salmon provided updates to Sky Sports viewers, explaining: ""Welcome back to the Cincinnati Open where unfortunately play is currently suspended. There is a local power outage which has meant a loss of pictures. The tennis did continue for a while. In that time, Taylor Fritz was able to complete that first set on a tiebreak against Lorenzo Sonego, and Benjamin Bonzi was able to come back from dropping the first set to Stefanos Tsitsipas, to move to 5-2 in the second [set] but a local power outage affects the electronic line calling. ""US broadcaster Tennis Channel also informed viewers through social media: ""Play in Cincinnati is currently suspended due to an onsite power outage.Stay tuned for updates on when the action resumes.""The suspension lasted approximately 90 minutes, with play resuming shortly after 6:30pm local time. It later appeared that the outage was due to a generator catching fire and impacting the power situation at the tournament in Mason.Before the power outage, several matches had been completed, including Emma Raducanu's three-hour and nine-minute battle against Aryna Sabalenka, which ended in a 7-6, 4-6, 7-6 defeat for the Briton.This incident marks the second time this season that a major ATP and WTA 1000 tournament has experienced power-related disruptions. A similar situation occurred at the Madrid Open in April, when a nationwide power cut in Spain forced the cancellation of all remaining matches for that day.Earlier in the day, before the power disruption, players including Anna Kalinskaya, Ekaterina Alexandrova, and Frances Tiafoe had successfully advanced to the last 16 of the tournament.","Play at the Cincinnati Open was temporarily suspended on Monday due to a local power outage.

Poll Do you agree with Sunil Gavaskar's criticism of the ECB for not inviting Anderson and Tendulkar? Yes, they should have been invited No, it was not necessary Not sure I don't follow cricket

Legendary India cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has slammed the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) for not inviting James Anderson and Sachin Tendulkar to the presentation ceremony of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.“This was the first-ever series named after Sachin Tendulkar and Jimmy Anderson, two of cricket’s greatest legends. One would have expected both to be present to hand over the trophy to the two captains, especially since the series ended in a draw,” Gavaskar wrote in his column for Sportstar.He also recalled a similar incident earlier this year in Australia, where he was excluded from the Border-Gavaskar Trophy presentation ceremony, with only Allan Border present at the conclusion. The explanation given at the time was that Australia had won the series, hence only their namesake was included.“To the best of one’s knowledge, both were in England at the time. So, were they simply not invited? Or was this similar to what happened in Australia earlier this year, when only Allan Border was asked to present the Border-Gavaskar Trophy because Australia had won the series? Since this England series was drawn, perhaps neither was asked to attend the presentation,” he said.Gavaskar also criticised the practice of awarding the newly introduced Pataudi Medal to the series-winning captain instead of the Player of the Series.“Mostly around the world, administrators are brought in to ensure profits and are quite good at it, but they may not have much knowledge about the history of the sport they are presiding over. So, these little gestures are not part of their scheme of things.Nobody from the Pataudi family was there either, for the Pataudi Medal, which was presented to the winning team’s captain.The drawn series showed how flawed the idea was of trying to make amends to the Pataudis by retiring the trophy named after them. Every time the series is drawn, the medal can’t be presented, can it? Wouldn’t it be better, therefore, to award the medal to the Player of the Series rather than the winning captain? And what if the captain himself has had an ordinary series and made little impact on the result?” Gavaskar said.",Gavaskar criticises ECB for not inviting Anderson and Tendulkar.

An anonymous scout revealed why Luka Doncic lost 30 pounds for next NBA season

Luka Doncic is ready for the next NBA season with the Los Angeles Lakers



Luka Doncic’s transformation has become one of the most talked-about storylines of the NBA offseason, and now, an anonymous scout believes the Los Angeles Lakers superstar is plotting a season to remember. After shedding 30 pounds and refining his conditioning, Doncic is reportedly “on a mission” to claim both the league MVP and scoring title, with a clear target in mind, proving the Dallas Mavericks wrong for ever letting him go.The buzz began during a EuroBasket friendly between Slovenia and Germany, where an NBA scout couldn’t believe the change. “Man, he looks incredible,” the scout told DallasHoopsJournal.com. “He’s quicker and more explosive. He’s getting by people more easily. I think he’s on a mission, man. I think he’s gonna win MVP and the scoring title next season. He wants to get revenge on Dallas for basically fat-shaming him. ”That comment refers to last season’s shocking midyear trade that sent Luka Doncic from the Dallas Mavericks to the Los Angeles Lakers. Mavericks management, including GM Nico Harrison, reportedly had lingering concerns over his weight, diet, and conditioning.Injuries, including a nagging calf issue. But in Los Angeles, Doncic averaged 28.2 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 7.5 assists across 28 games, then boosted his playoff output to over 30 points per game.This summer, his approach changed completely. Doncic embraced a strict gluten-free, low-sugar diet, intermittent fasting for 16 hours daily except Sundays, and consuming “at least 250 grams of protein” along with a daily almond milk shake. Photos from his Men’s Health cover and TV appearances confirmed what fans could see — the 26-year-old looks leaner, stronger, and more explosive than at any point in his career.Doncic signed a three-year, $165 million extension with the Lakers on August 2, making his his status as the centerpiece of JJ Redick’s starting lineup alongside LeBron James, Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura, and new addition Deandre Ayton. He’s also played an active role in team-building, recruiting Ayton and Marcus Smart to the purple and gold. “I’m going to keep working as hard as I can to bring another championship to Los Angeles and to make Laker Nation proud,” Doncic said. “This is just the beginning. I’m excited for what’s ahead.”The Lakers doubled down on his physical transformation by hiring Jeremy Holsopple, the former Mavericks strength and conditioning coach who once helped Doncic maintain his elite quickness and vertical explosion. The reunion could ensure his fitness gains stick deep into the season.Also Read: Los Angeles Lakers forward Rui Hachimura turns heads with traditional sumo workout in rare off-court training footage With career averages of 28.6 points, 8.6 rebounds, and 8.2 assists, Doncic already ranks third all-time in points per game behind Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain. But this season is about rewriting the narrative Dallas wrote for him.

How the rumours started and what outlets reported at the time

Why the episode mattered — team chemistry, media and perspective years later

The 2018 Ryder Cup in Paris is remembered for many things — Europe’s strong comeback, heated competition, and, behind the scenes, a story that swirled through corridors and tabloids. One of the most persistent rumours that autumn involved Paulina Gretzky and an alleged falling-out between teammates Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka. Although never proven, the saga became part of the event’s off-ice narrative and offered a glimpse into how gossip can shape perceptions during high-pressure team events.Reports from Golf Digest and L’Equipe carried whispers of a “heated” squabble aboard the flight to Paris, with an unnamed insider telling L’Equipe the mood on the plane was “horrible.” That kind of detail — sourced, but anonymous — is exactly the sort of fuel that turns a private spat into a public story.For fans and media, the idea of inter-player tension made the Ryder Cup drama feel larger than the scores. Ultimately, the American side fell to a cohesive European outfit, 17.5-10.5, a result commentators linked to on- and off-ice dynamics.Brooks Koepka pushed back against the gossip when questioned after the tournament, dismissing the claims of a fight and insisting the relationship with Johnson was intact.He said: ""This Dustin thing, I don't get. There was no fight, no argument. He is one of my best friends.""We talked on the phone on Monday and yesterday so tell me how we fought? I don't know. People like to make a story and run with it and it is not the first time a story has come out that is not true.""From a throwback viewpoint, the episode highlights how fragile team chemistry can seem under media pressure. Johnson publicly sought to extinguish breakup chatter, writing: ""Every relationship goes through its ups and downs, but most importantly, we love each other very much and are committed to being a family. Thank you for your love and support."" Whether the rumours affected results is impossible to quantify, but they show how off-ice narratives can overshadow performance.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky’s silence on Donald Trump’s anti-Canada rhetoric still sparks debate years later Looking back, the 2018 Ryder Cup reminder is simple: big events amplify small stories, and athletes often must manage both competition and the headlines that follow.",The 2018 Ryder Cup saw rumours of a falling-out between Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka.

From London rinks to the NHL limelight: Nazem Kadri’s journey



Nazem Kadri's initial highs, lows, and headlines



The Controversial Career of Nazem Kadri

Nazem Kadri is one of those contemporary NHL players who went through his own set of ups and downs—from his early years as a polarizing forward with the Toronto Maple Leafs to his Stanley Cup-winning triumph with the Colorado Avalanche. Today he is an experienced face in the Calgary Flames. His existence has been marked by pressure moments, scandal, and redemption.Born in 1990 in London, Ontario, Nazem Kadri left his mark early with a sparkling career for the London Knights and Kitchener Rangers of the Ontario Hockey League. He immediately impressed NHL scouts with his play and was taken seventh overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2009.Nazem Kadri’s decade with the Toronto Maple Leafs was anything but quiet. He became the emotional heartbeat of the team, delivering consecutive 30-goal seasons and frequently adding stimulation with his tough brand of hockey. But under playoff bright lights, surprise suspensions and discipline were worthy of criticism.As much as the Maple Leafs enjoyed his zest, they did go in another direction and sent him to the Colorado Avalanche in 2019 after trade negotiations had earlier fallen through—one of which involved a potential trade to Calgary—when he possessed a no-trade clause.In the Colorado Avalanche, Nazem Kadri thrived. Woven into a fabric of other top performers in Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar, he developed his two-way game and tallied career bests, including 87 points in the 2021–22 season. His postseason performances were nothing short of spectacular, battling through sickness to help Colorado win its first Stanley Cup in over two decades. Holding the Stanley Cup aloft was an iconic moment, proving himself to be more thana talented agitator.Also read: NHL Trade Rumors: Five potential destinations for Nazem Kadri if the Flames deal him From his name, Kadri signed a seven-year, $49 million contract with the Calgary Flames. He also brought production and leadership, having posted 56- and 75-point seasons before a 2024–25 season in which he posted 35 goals and 67 points. Kadri, now 35 years old, is still a difference-maker—still feisty battling for the puck, still a goal-scorer in clutch situations, and still playing with the desperation that made him hard to overlook at first.","Nazem Kadri is a forward for the Calgary Flames of the NHL.
