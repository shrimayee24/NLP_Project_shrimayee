I said sir my leadership role as a player will always be there, only the captain tag won't be there in front of me but whatever in my capacity till I hang up my boots, I will always give my 100% for the country. I'm going to suggest you a name who I feel has a good cricketing brain.

NEW DELHI: Australian bowling legend Brett Lee praised Gautam Gambhir 's appointment as Team India's head coach, highlighting his on-field aggression and game awareness as beneficial for the Men in Blue.The BCCI recently announced Gambhir as the new head coach of the Indian team following Rahul Dravid's departure. Gambhir, who guided Kolkata Knight Riders to their third IPL title in 2024 as a mentor, took over after India's T20 World Cup victory ended an 11-year ICC trophy drought in Dravid's final assignment.Gambhir's coaching tenure will begin with an away white-ball series against Sri Lanka, featuring three T20Is and three ODIs, starting on July 27.In an interview with, Lee, who played 76 Tests, 221 ODIs, and 25 T20Is for Australia between 1999 and 2012, discussed Gambhir's new role, India's World Cup triumph, Surya's remarkable catch, and more. Lee recently represented Australia Legends in the World Championships of Legends.He's (Gautam Gambhir) done a terrific job every time he's had an opportunity. The Indian Premier League title with KKR is the best example. He's always been there, always at the top of his game. He finds a way to unite his players and graft his team together. He builds a solid structure. He has been a terrific player, and his aggression and winning attitude will help India. He has shone internationally as a player. India is in safe hands with Gautam Gambhir as coach. Congratulations to Rahul for finishing on a high.Big, big congratulations to India. Firstly, it was really good to see them and the emotion on the faces of those cricketers. Virat and Rohit have moved on from the game. There were players from the Australian cricket team who also hung up their boots. So, it was a swan song for a number of players from different countries around the world. One thing I will say is that India played the perfect style of cricket in the T20 World Cup. They looked like a strong side, to be very honest. Massive congratulations to Rohit Sharma and the Indian team. He led from the front in the tournament.Well, catches win you matches, don't they? I mean, Surya plucked the ball out of the sky. It was a brilliant, title-winning catch. It was a truly spectacular catch.Just moderation and eating well. I did a lot of training while I was in India for two and a half months. I trained every single day. I follow proper routines, focusing on exercise and diet plans. That's it. I'm having fun doing it. As a fast bowler, it's important to maintain your fitness. I'm probably fitter now than I was when I was playing, to be perfectly honest.Well, we'll wait and see. I'm not going to get all political.We're at a bit of a crossroads now with the Australian cricket team. We've seen some wonderful performances in the last 12-18 months and some incredible players over the last 10-15 years. Players stepping away from the Aussie cricket team creates holes and gaps but also opportunities. If I look at the top of the order, we have produced some brilliant players in the last 10-15 years.Now it's the next generation coming through, like Jake Fraser-McGurk. These players will have some big shoes to fill. David Warner and Aaron Finch are exceptional players who have been performing consistently for many years. It's time for the next generation of young cricketers to come through and flourish. So, I think it's positive for Australia. It's not great that they didn't win the World Cup, but you have to look ahead and seize those opportunities.It's not a matter of what went wrong; it's about Australia improving and continuing to improve. You can't win every single game of cricket. They tried their hardest and had a very good squad. They've played some really decent cricket in the past. Mitchell Marsh was given the opportunity, and he wanted to grab it with both hands. Pat Cummins has done a terrific job. It's hard being captain; it's not easy. The captain has a lot of pressure on them, so it's a massive job. It's a job you should take and treat with the utmost respect while enjoying the opportunity. Personally, I thought they would have gone with Pat Cummins, but they gave Mitchell Marsh the opportunity. I'm not part of that inner sanctum at the moment, so it's very hard to comment on how or why it happened. But they've chosen a captain, so back him.","Australian bowling legend Brett Lee praises Gautam Gambhir's appointment as Team India's head coach.

Shehan Jayasuriya launched an offensive against Pat Cummins and Haris Rauf, while Ryan Rickelton was a little inconsistent.The game changed when Liam Plunkett was brought on after the powerplay, as the Englishman claimed two wickets.In the middle overs, the Orcas went from 76/0 to 98/5 when Jayasuriya fell after reaching fifty and Klaasen fell cheaply.With five overs remaining and needing to score more than ten per over, the Orcas attempted to do so through Harmeet Singh and Hammad Azam, but they were unable to consistently reach the boundaries as the Unicorn bowlers deftly slowed the tempo and unleashed a barrage of cutters.In the end, the Corey Anderson-led side registered a comfortable win by 23 runs as the Orcas finished at 142/6 in their 20 overs.After the game, player of the match Liam Plunkett said, ""The way they batted in the powerplay, they got a decent start but it was always going to get tough when the ball got older. The plan was to try and maximise that phase.""Orcas captain Heinrich Klaasen said, ""We didn't bat well once again. The bowlers have been fantastic so far, the batters are letting the bowlers down.""On Jayasuriya, Klaasen said, ""That's the reason he's back in the team. He can be explosive up front. I'm so pleased it came off for him today and hopefully it can continue for the rest of the tournament. The pitch got a lot more difficult than expected. They bowled well, specially Plunkett but then also there was a bit of tactical fault from our side. We could have controlled things better.""Talking about the next game, Klaasen said, ""Yeah, it would seem like a must win. The group is staggered nicely, so a win here can bump you up a couple of places. We want to go to Dallas with a win, and win there and hopefully get into the playoffs.""Unicorns captain Corey Anderson said, ""Pretty good result. The boys did a great job in the back end of the batting innings and then came out strong with the ball.""On Sanjay Krishnamurthi, who scored a 21-ball 30, Anderson said, ""He's a young kid who's got so much talent. Huge pluses for him today. It was a pretty big innings in the context of the game. 20 odd in a game like this is huge.""Talking about Australia Test and ODI captain Pat Cummins, Anderson said, ""He is a world class player, just having him in the group speaking cricket calms the group. Great for the balance of the team as well. We want to try and win every game, we go back to Dallas and we want to reassess quickly and hopefully we can get a bit of momentum out of this one.""","The Seattle Orcas messed up a fairly straightforward chase and lost to San Francisco Unicorns by 23 runs in their Major League Cricket 2024 match at Church Street Park, Morrisville on Monday.

Rohit Sharma 's brutal attack against Australia 's bowling spearhead Mitchell Starc during the recently concluded T20 World Cup has become part of cricketing folklore, as it not just helped India beat the Aussies but also put them on the brink of an early exit from the tournament. For some, it was also revenge for the defeat in the ODI World Cup final last year.The loos against India hit Australia's chances hard as the 2021 champions failed to enter the semis, while India went on to win the trophy defeating South Africa in the final.India's win followed euphoric celebrations on the field in Barbados, in the dressing room and later upon their arrival home. The T20 world champions were invited by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, followed by an open bus parade at the Marine Drive in Mumbai that saw lakhs of fans coming onto the streets to join their heroes in celebration.While the win has started sinking in, the Rohit mania fails to cease as the India captain visited the US for a promotional event after a small family vacation in the UK, and was greeted by fans with shouts of ""Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Starc"".It was the fans' way of telling the skipper that they enjoyed him taking the Australian apart and will never forget the entertainment.The shouts drew Rohit's attention instantaneously. He replied, ""calm down, guys"" and followed it up with a cheeky smile while on the stage.India met Australia during the 'Super 8s' stage of the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean, and Rohit played probably the best innings of the tournament, scoring 92 runs off just 41 deliveries.Starc bore the maximum impact of Rohit's onslaught, conceding 29 runs in one over where he was smashed for four sixes and a four.Reflecting later on that during an episode of Willow Talk podcast, Starc had said: ""I have played a lot against him. He had a good tournament, especially at the back end. I think he targeted that wind in St Lucia as well. It was the one end that went for a lot more (runs) than the other.”""I think I had five bad balls and he hit them all for six.""","Rohit Sharma hit Mitchell Starc for four sixes and a four during T20 World Cup.

Indian bowlers, spearheaded by Anureet Singh's three-wicket haul, effectively restricted Pakistan's run flow. As a result, India's target appeared manageable, although they faced initial setbacks.Openers Robin Uthappa and Ambati Rayudu got India off to a promising start with a 34-run partnership. However, pacer Aamer Yamin swung the momentum back in Pakistan's favor by dismissing Uthappa and Suresh Raina in the same over, leaving India at 38/2.Rayudu then partnered with Gurkeerat Singh Mann, adding a 60-run stand for the third wicket, with Rayudu smashing a quick 50 off 30 balls. His innings featured two sixes and five boundaries. However, Pakistan's Saeed Ajmal provided a crucial breakthrough by dismissing Rayudu in the 12th over.Shoaib Malik then removed Gurkeerat, 34 off 33, to further dent India's chase in the next over.The Indian score stood at 108/4 when Yusuf Pathan and Yuvraj Singh joined forces. Pathan played an aggressive 30 off 16 balls, hitting three towering sixes, while Yuvraj held his ground with an unbeaten 15 from 22 deliveries. Their partnership of 42 runs in just 5.4 overs was pivotal.With Yusuf going for big shots, captain Yuvraj played an uncharacteristically slow knock. But their stand for the fifth wicket turned out to be the deciding factor in the end.In the 19th over, Wahab Riaz dismissed Yusuf Pathan, leaving India needing just seven more runs from 10 balls. Yuvraj and Irfan Pathan then ensured India reached the target, with Irfan hitting the winning boundary off Sohail Tanvir on the first ball of the final over.Earlier, Pakistan's innings was primarily held together by Shoaib Malik, who top-scored with 41 runs off 36 balls, including three sixes. Contributions also came from Sohail Tanvir, who added an unbeaten 19 off 9 deliveries.For India, besides Anureet Singh's standout performance with figures of 3 for 43, Irfan Pathan (1 for 12), Pawan Negi (1 for 24), and Vinay Kumar (1 for 36) provided essential support by taking key wickets.While Malik and Tanvir's efforts pushed Pakistan past the 150-mark, it wasn't sufficient to defend against a disciplined Indian side. Despite some pressure moments, the Indian batting lineup showcased resilience and strategic play to clinch the title.","India Champions beat Pakistan Champions by five wickets in the 2024 World Championship of Legends final held in Birmingham.

First two days of England-West Indies game at Lord's summed up where Test cricket is: Nasser Hussain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/first-two-days-of-england-west-indies-game-at-lords-summed-up-where-test-cricket-is-nasser-hussain/articleshow/111762058.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former England captain Nasser Hussain expressed his concerns about the current state of Test cricket following England's swift victory against the West Indies in the opening match at Lord's.The hosts secured a commanding win by an innings and 114 runs within the first hour on day three, taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.The contrasting preparation levels between the two teams were evident, as England had the benefit of playing County Championship matches, while the West Indies had only a single three-day red-ball game against First Class Counties XI.Furthermore, most of the West Indian players have not participated in red-ball cricket since their thrilling eight-run triumph over Australia in Brisbane back in January. Hussain's comments highlight the challenges faced by the longest format of the game in the modern era.""Those two days summed up for me where we are with Test cricket. You talk about all the batting they could have but they're off in a white-ball sunset, you've got bowlers who haven't bowled, you've got undercooked cricketers, and then you lose the toss and have the worst of conditions, and everyone goes 'Test cricket is dying'.""""But if you prepare for a Test match like that, you'll get exactly what England get when they go away. It frustrates me because you've got to give Test matches the preparation that they deserve, which is a very easy thing to say but a very difficult thing to do in modern times,"" said Hussain, as quoted by IANS, on the Sky Sports Cricket Podcast.The upcoming Test match between England and the West Indies at Trent Bridge has sparked interest among fans and experts alike. Many are wondering if this second encounter will offer a more closely contested battle compared to the previous match.""The other story is 'the West Indies are in terminal decline' -- England haven't won in the Caribbean for two decades and (the West Indies) hold the Richard-Botham Trophy.""""England travel to India or Australia and don't particularly do well, so it shouldn't just be a West Indies story. All it does is add to the fact that Test-match cricket is in a difficult place, and it is sort of self-perpetuating.""""If you don't look after it, then sides turn up and put in a performance like that, and everyone goes, 'Told you, Test-match cricket is dying'. Listening to you speaking to Jimmy Anderson after 188 Test matches on the podium, I would like to think we would try to look after Test-match cricket.""Following his retirement from international cricket at Lord's, James Anderson expressed his deep affection for Test cricket, as recounted by former England captain Michael Atherton . Anderson, who bid farewell to the international stage, spoke with great enthusiasm about his passion for the longest format of the game.""Anderson said, 'Test cricket has literally made me the person I am'. So, all the lessons he's drawn from Test cricket -- the ups, the downs, the highs, the lows, the coming back for that third spell at six o'clock in the evening and having to dig deep within yourself.""""All of the things which have made him the mature person he is, Test cricket has helped him along the way. I wanted to ask him about it because it's at a fragile time, he's going to move onto a mentoring role and you'd hope, because there are young players coming through now who will have career choices to make.""""You'd like to feel Jimmy would say to them 'sometimes the easiest choices are not always the most rewarding or most fulfilling'…although everybody needs to pay the bills, one understands that.""",Former England captain Nasser Hussain has expressed his concerns about the state of Test cricket. Hussain's comments highlight the challenges faced by the longest format of the game in the modern era.

Never going to be easy to replace Rohit and Virat: Vikram Rathour,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/never-going-to-be-easy-to-replace-rohit-and-virat-vikram-rathour/articleshow/111757677.cms,"""Always told Virat to believe in his methods""

Rahul gave us space and honest feedback

NEW DELHI: Vikram Rathour , the departing batting coach, is aware of the impending challenges that the Indian team will face in the coming years. However, having closely observed and nurtured the current pool of talent, he believes that the team possesses the necessary skills and adaptability to navigate through this transitional phase successfully.The key, according to Rathour, lies in managing the transition in a ""controlled and gradual manner"".While the team will continue to rely on the experience and expertise of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in ODIs and Tests for the time being, it is crucial to recognize that their careers are approaching the final stages.As a result, the team management must start preparing for the inevitable change in leadership and the void that their eventual departures will create.""It is never going to be easy to replace people of Rohit and Virat's calibre,"" Rathour, also a former selector, told PTI in an exclusive interview.""The recently-concluded series against Zimbabwe (on Sunday) gave us some glimpse into how the T20 team will look like in future. But we still have a few years in Test and ODI cricket to get to that point,"" said one of the key members of Rahul Dravid 's coaching team.Rathour, who has held the positions of national selector and coach for the senior team, possesses a deep understanding of the country's cricketing talent. His experience in these roles has provided him with a unique perspective on the current state of Indian cricket.""I won't be too concerned about it. We have a lot of depth in Indian cricket. There are lots of very talented and skilful players who are coming through the system. The only thing we need to make sure is the transition is done in a controlled manner. It needs to be gradual.He believes that by the time Rohit and Kohli hang up their boots, the emerging talents will have firmly established themselves, ready to carry the torch forward for the next decade.""I am hoping that by then, players like Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant, Yashasavi Jaiswal, Dhruv Jurel to name a few, would establish themselves and will make the transition smooth.""In ODIs also, we have experienced players like Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya to take over,"" Rathour said in a confident analysis.Gill and Jaiswal have the potential to become the backbone of India's batting lineup in the coming years, much like how Kohli and Rohit shouldered the responsibility for over ten years.""There are many exciting players coming through but these two are equipped to play all three formats for a long time. They are going to be the backbone of Indian batting in years to come,"" the former Punjab skipper said.Rathour's opinion carries significance, especially considering his role as a valuable advisor to Dravid over the past three years. When he expresses his belief that Rinku Singh has the potential to excel as a Test batter, it is a statement that deserves attention and consideration.""When I see him (Rinku) bat in nets, I can't find any technical reasons why Rinku cannot be a successful Test batter. I understand he has made his name as a terrific finisher in T20 cricket but if you look at his first-class record, he is averaging in high 50s.""He (Rinku) is also blessed with a very calm temperament. So all these factors indicate that if given an opportunity, he can develop into a Test cricketer,"" Rathour said.Rathour consistently encountered inquiries about Kohli's prolonged slump following the 2019 World Cup at nearly every media interaction. His response remained steadfast, asserting that it was a ""phase that everyone has to go through"".""There were no technical issues that we worked on specifically during this phase. The constant messaging to him was to keep working hard and believe in his methods. Eventually he came back stronger and an even better player,"" he said.Rathour and Dravid first faced each other on the cricket pitch during a domestic match prior to their shared Test debut series in 1996 against England. This marked the beginning of a connection that would span thirty years.Their long-standing association proved beneficial when they eventually joined forces as part of the coaching team.""Rahul is the best coach that I have worked with, who gives you lots of space to work, is open to suggestions and will provide you an honest feedback.""One of the first discussions we had was about changing the batting template in T20 cricket. We agreed that we needed to bring in more intent and aggression in our batting approach,"" he revealed.Rathour highlighted Axar Patel as an example of a player who addressed the team's need for a reliable batting choice at the number eight position.""That made a massive difference and gave the batters in top order lot more freedom to bat.""Axar was always a good batter and all he needed was opportunity to express himself fearlessly with an ""uncomplicated technique"".","Vikram Rathour is the departing batting coach of the Indian cricket team.

He emphasized the importance of recognizing and celebrating Warner's legacy as a crucial player across all formats of the game.""Our understanding is that David is retired, and (he) should be commended on what has been an incredible career across all three formats. You never know when Bull's joking…think he's just stirring the pot a bit.“He's had a wonderful career, can't celebrate it enough, and think as time goes by, his legacy of what he has done for Australia and we reflect back on that, the legend of a player is only going to continue to grow. But as far as this team goes and the journey to transition to some different players, in his case across all three formats, it's going to be exciting,"" IANS quoted Bailey as saying to reporters.Bailey also affirmed thatGlenn Maxwell and Mitchell Starc remain integral to the team's plans for the 2025 Champions Trophy and possibly the 2026 Men's T20 World Cup. This statement comes in the wake of the decision to rest the two players from the T20I matches against Scotland and England, respectively, in September.""I don't think there's anyone who's not there that we've put a line through permanently besides David. This is the way we are going with this squad. If opportunities arise or there are gaps at different points there's nothing to say that Wadey might not come back, but certainly, at this point, we are excited about giving Josh (Inglis) a run.""The next T20 World Cup is 2026, so I imagine there may be some more changes than what we are seeing in this squad but specifically to those guys (Starc and Maxwell), no we haven't had any conversations about where they think their T20 journey may finish. Certainly for Glenn and Mitch, the Champions Trophy is very much on the horizon, (and is a) very important tournament for those guys.""And Starcy in particular, I think he's going to have a huge summer. Clearly, some of the decisions made around this series are around prioritising and getting guys right for what will be a really big summer. As far as ending players, seeing where guys might finish up, we haven't had those conversations,"" he elaborated.Bailey commended Mitchell Marsh for his leadership of the Australian team during the T20 World Cup. Although Australia was eliminated in the Super Eights stage after losing to Afghanistan and India, Bailey recognized Marsh's captaincy skills.""I loved the way he captained through the T20 World Cup. He was really clear on how he wanted to lead that team. He was as disappointed as anyone that we didn't get to the end goal that everyone was hoping to achieve, but if you look at his early success rate as a captain across T20 he's done a really great job.""",David Warner will not be considered for selection in the Champions Trophy scheduled for 2025.

We celebrated together and sometimes shed a tear together.""Mueller's illustrious international career has come to an end following Germany's heartbreaking 2-1 defeat against Spain in the Euro 2024 quarter-finals.The match, which took place on German soil, saw Spain's Mikel Merino score a decisive goal in the dying moments of extra time, shattering the host nation's dreams of lifting the trophy.Visibly emotional after the game, Mueller suggested that this might have been his final appearance for the German national team.The veteran player stated his intention to discuss his future with the team's head coach, Julian Nagelsmann , to determine whether ""it was the 'sensible option' to step aside in favour of younger players.""Following Mueller's announcement, Nagelsmann lauded his qualities as a player, adding that the German team would ""miss him very much"".""Nobody is like Thomas Mueller,"" said Rudi Voeller , the Germany national team director and a prolific striker in his own right.""His value to German football cannot be overestimated,"" Voeller said in a statement.Mueller was ""unorthodox, intuitive, unpredictable and that is precisely why (he) is successful"", Voeller said.Mueller's international career was marked by numerous achievements, including winning the Golden Boot at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, where he scored five goals in his debut year with the national team.He also played a crucial role in Germany's triumphant 2014 World Cup campaign, scoring the opening goal in their memorable 7-1 victory over hosts Brazil in the semi-finals.Among the players who were part of Germany's World Cup-winning squad in 2014, only goalkeeper Manuel Neuer remains involved in the national team set-up. Another notable player from that team, midfielder Toni Kroos , had already announced his retirement from international football before Euro 2024.Despite his decision to step away from the national team, Mueller will continue his club career with Bayern Munich , where he has a contract until 2025. The charismatic striker has been a key player for the Bavarian giants, contributing to their numerous domestic and international successes over the years.""The younger generation doesn't know the national team without Thomas Mueller and I can't really imagine it without him,"" Bayern president Herbert Hainer said in a statement.""I'm delighted that Thomas will continue to play for our club.""Mueller has made an impressive 131 appearances for his country. This remarkable feat places him third on the list of most-capped German players, surpassed only by the legendary Lothar Matthaeus and the prolific striker Miroslav Klose.In addition to his longevity and consistency, Mueller has also proven himself to be a reliable goal scorer for Germany. His tally of goals puts him in sixth place on the nation's all-time scoring chart.He shares this position with Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, another iconic figure in German football history. However, Mueller still trails behind the likes of Klose and Rudi Voeller, who have found the back of the net more frequently for their country.""His achievements and his titles speak for themselves,"" German football association president Bernd Neuendorf said in a statement.""With his goals and his ingenuity, he played a key role in shaping one of the most successful periods in the history of our national team,"" Neuendorf said.In his goodbye message, Mueller called on fans to ""keep your fingers crossed for the team on the way to the 2026 World Cup"".""I'm doing that too. Now as a fan in the stands and no longer as a player on the pitch.""",Thomas Mueller has announced his retirement from international football.

Spain has played well throughout the tournament. If they play like the way they have played all the games, I am sure they can easily go past England,"" said Kuldeep ahead of the match.When asked who he is cheering for, Kuldeep said: ""A final is always tough, but I am supporting Spain and I think they will go past England and win 2-1.""Spain's Mikel Oyarzabal, who came on as a substitute, scored the decisive goal in the 86th minute, securing a 2-1 victory for Spain.Oyarzabal's winning goal came from a quick counter-attack, sealing Spain's perfect record in the tournament, having emerged victorious in all seven matches they played.The first half was characterized by extreme caution, with Spain dominating possession while England managed the only shot on target.

The defeat prolonged Kane's quest for a trophy.Substituted off the pitch, the Bayern Munich forward could only observe helplessly as Mikel Oyarzabal scored the winning goal in the 86th minute.Throughout his 60 minutes of play, Kane managed a mere 13 touches on the ball, reflecting his inability to significantly influence the game, a trend that persisted across the tournament.""It's hard to put into words how we're all feeling right now,"" he said.""These finals aren't easy to get to.

Despite his impressive goal tally, Bayern experienced a trophyless season for the first time since 2012, overshadowed by Bayer Leverkusen's domestic double.England entered the Euros as favorites, bolstered by the stunning performances of young stars like Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, Bukayo Saka, and Cole Palmer.However, they failed to live up to the hype, with Kane appearing physically exhausted and hampered by a back injury that had ended his club season prematurely.""Physically it has been tough for him,"" said Southgate.""He came into the tournament short on games and has not quite reached the level we all would have hoped.""Southgate, for the fifth time in seven tournament games, decided to substitute his captain. The change proved effective in the semi-final, as Ollie Watkins scored a stunning winner in stoppage time against the Netherlands.In search of an equaliser after Nico Williams had given Spain the lead early in the second half, Southgate once again turned to Watkins. England responded, with Palmer finding the far corner from outside the box. Kane celebrated from the bench, but it was the best moment for Southgate's team, as Spain gradually regained control before Oyarzabal's decisive strike.The future of England's coach and captain now hangs in the balance. Southgate said he will take time to consider his position, while Kane will be approaching 33 by the time the next World Cup arrives.Given Bayern's financial dominance in German football , silverware seems inevitable at some point.
