After his retirement, Shaun White has still been a talk of the town in the Olympic circles. Twenty years after winning gold as a teenager in Italy, the American icon returned for the 2026 Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics in a new role. NBC tapped him as an expert commentator and co-host for the Opening Ceremony at San Siro Stadium in Milan. The five-time Olympian retired after the 2022 Beijing Winter Games, where he finished fourth in his final run.White built a career that redefined snowboarding. He won three Olympic gold medals, all in the halfpipe, and became the most decorated snowboarder in Olympic history. He also owns 15 X Games gold medals and 23 total podium finishes. His astonishing legacy is now reflected in his media presence as he views the games with experienced eyes.Shaun White’s career after retirement from competition is still exciting. At the 2026 Games, he embraced life beyond the halfpipe. ""This is all an exciting time for me, from announcing and being a part of the Olympics in this new way,"" White told Olympics.com.""I am excited to take it all in. See the different events like ice skating, skiing, half pipe, big air, obviously snowboarding.I'm just going try to see everything honestly, that's my goal.""He even set a playful target. ""I'm trying to get Snoop,"" White said. ""Snoop on a snowboard is my goal. We need him on the board, and I'm going to try to do that.""White has expanded his influence through business and sport. He founded The Snow League in 2024, aiming to elevate professional snowboarding and freeskiing.At the 2006 Torino Games, he recovered from a poor first run to post a 46.8 in the final and win gold at 19. In Vancouver 2010, he secured victory on his first run and turned the second into a celebratory lap featuring a double McTwist 1260. After missing the podium in Sochi, he returned in 2018 with back to back 1440s to claim his third gold.His road to PyeongChang included a severe crash in 2017. Across five Olympics, he became the face of snowboarding and helped carry it into the mainstream.Shaun White’s personal life drew attention when he and actress Nina Dobrev ended their engagement in September 2025 after five years together. The couple had announced their engagement in October 2024.Dobrev later spoke about taking her time with marriage. ""I really want to enjoy it and not rush that process,"" she told E! News. ""We're just enjoying being engaged at this point and being in that sort of phase because a lot of your life is—you have a boyfriend for half of your life and then you have a husband for half of your life, but the fiancé period is very short.""It appears that the duo moved on with their personal lives.","Shaun White is the most decorated snowboarder in Olympic history.

200-plus totals for India in T20WC

NEW DELHI: India once again underlined why they are regarded as the most destructive batting unit in the shortest format, riding on blistering half-centuries from Ishan Kishan and Hardik Pandya to post a formidable 209/9 against Namibia in their Group A clash of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Thursday.Kishan set the tone with a breathtaking 61 off just 24 deliveries, mixing brute force with clean timing as he dismantled Namibia’s pace attack in the powerplay. His innings, studded with crisp boundaries and towering sixes, powered India to a staggering 104/1 in just seven overs. Pandya then took over the mantle, striking a muscular 52 off 28 balls, ensuring India maintained momentum despite losing wickets at regular intervals later in the innings.Namibia, however, found a way to pull things back through their skipper Gerhard Erasmus, who delivered a remarkable spell of unorthodox slingy bowling. Erasmus finished with career-best figures of 4/20, using variations and subtle changes in pace to choke the Indian batters on a surface that offered some grip to the spinners. Alongside Bernard Scholtz, Erasmus applied the brakes through the middle overs, forcing India into errors as they attempted to sustain the scoring rate.Although Pandya staged a late counter-attack to bring up his half-century, India lost five wickets in the final two overs, allowing Namibia to claw back some respectability. From a position where India looked set to breach 220 comfortably, Namibia would take heart from restricting the damage to just over 200.With this innings, India extended their tally of 200-plus scores in Men’s T20 Internationals to 47 — the most by any team. South Africa trail with 29 such totals, followed by New Zealand (28), while Australia and West Indies are joint fourth with 25 each.India’s recent scoring spree has been even more emphatic. Since the T20 World Cup 2024, they have registered 14 totals of 200 or more in T20Is, double the number managed by any other side in the same period. The consistency highlights the depth and fearlessness of India’s batting approach.In T20 World Cup history too, India’s ability to cross the 200-run mark has been a recurring theme. Their notable tallies include 218/4 against England in Durban in 2007, 210/2 versus Afghanistan in Abu Dhabi in 2021, 205/5 against Australia in Gros Islet in 2024, and now 209/9 against Namibia in Delhi in 2026.47 - India29 - South Africa28 - New Zealand25 - Australia25 - West Indies218/4 vs ENG, Durban, 2007210/2 vs AFG, Abu Dhabi, 2021209/9 vs NAM, Delhi, 2026205/5 vs AUS, Gros Islet, 2024","India posted 209/9 against Namibia in their Group A clash of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Rohit Sharma has warned Team India not to take their high-profile T20 World Cup 2026 clash against Pakistan lightly, even though they are favourites on paper.India face Pakistan on February 15 at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, and Rohit believes past records or rankings won’t matter once the match starts.India have dominated Pakistan in T20 World Cups and recent T20Is, but Rohit stressed that cricket can be unpredictable and every team can win on its day.Speaking at an event in Dubai, he said, “Firstly I never believed in this word called favourites. It’s such a funny game, and we’ve seen it now there’s so much that has happened in this last 10 years of international cricket. All these teams have so much exposure now playing T20 cricket.""You can’t just go and think that it’s a two-point victory for us. You just have to play good cricket on that particular day to achieve those points otherwise you might end up going home without anything.”He added that current form, reputation or history won’t guarantee success.According to Rohit, the key is performing on the day of the match, because any team can beat another in T20 cricket.“So it’s not about what you’ve done in the past, what is your team like, players are in form or not form. You just have to play well on that particular day because every team is capable of beating any team on that particular day,” he said.India have lost only once to Pakistan in World Cups, in the 2021 T20 World Cup, and have beaten them in their last five T20I meetings.",Former India captain Rohit Sharma warns Team India not to take Pakistan lightly.

Poll Do you think Abhishek Sharma will be fit to play against Pakistan? Yes, he will be fit No, he won't be ready

NEW DELHI: India’s preparations for the high-voltage T20 World Cup clash against Pakistan have been dominated by one burning question — will Abhishek Sharma be fit in time? Conflicting updates from teammates and captain have only added to the intrigue ahead of Sunday’s marquee encounter.Spinner Varun Chakravarthy struck an optimistic note after India’s win over Namibia, revealing that the explosive opener could be on track for a comeback. “As far as I have spoken to him he looks good, he did some practice today also. He told me he is on the way,” Varun said, hinting at a possible return.However, skipper Suryakumar Yadav painted a more cautious picture. Abhishek, who was hospitalised earlier this week with a stomach infection, is still regaining strength after being discharged. “Abhishek isn’t fine still, might take one or two games,” Surya admitted, suggesting the team would prioritise his full recovery.The attacking left-hander missed the Namibia clash, where Sanju Samson partnered Ishan Kishan at the top of the order. Even as the team trained at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, Abhishek did not join full sessions, with reports indicating weakness and slight weight loss following the illness.Team management is expected to make a final call after monitoring his workload during training in Colombo. Traditionally, Abhishek spends long hours batting in nets and that endurance test could determine whether he is ready for the pressure of an India-Pakistan showdown.For now, India appear caught between hope and caution: Varun’s upbeat “he is on the way” versus Suryakumar’s realistic “might take one or two games” assessment.",India face Pakistan in their opening T20 World Cup match on Sunday.

Bad Bunny has divided the country with his Super Bowl LX performance



Bad Bunny, the Super Bowl LX halftime show headliner, broke records on Sunday night with his performance even though it has divided the country.While Bad Bunny set the stage on fire, his ex girlfriend and supermodel, Kendall Jenner, was also spotted at the show along with her sister, Kim Kardashian and her new romance, Lewis Hamilton. Amid this, a clip of Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner leaving together in a luxurious car has sparked chaos.A few hours ago, a clip of the popular Grammy winner Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner hopping into his $3 million Buggati Chiron have sparked panic among fans.Much to the disappointment of fans, the clip is actually three years old. The popular clip was taken in April 2023 when Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner were publicly dating and had gone to Tyler, the Creator’s concert.The “Debí Tirar Más Fotos” artist, Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner went public with their high profile relationship in 2023 but went their separate ways by the end of that year.Later, in 2024, the two did get back together for a few months but ended things again.

Rajasthan Royals trade, releases, IPL squad retention: Crucial auction for Sanju Samson-less RR

India all-rounder Riyan Parag is all set to be named as the new Rajasthan Royals captain at 4pm today. While options included Yashasvi Jaiswal, Dhruv Jurel and even the experienced Ravindra Jadeja, the think tank favoured Parag, who has been with the franchise since making his IPL debut in 2019. The RR unit has consistently backed the youngster and even retained him for Rs 14 crore ahead of the 2025 edition of the cash-rich league.He was always groomed for bigger roles in the franchise and the big hint came last season when he served as the stand-in captain in the absence of the injured Sanju Samson . The original captain also signalled what the future could hold.""I won’t be Rajasthan Royals ' captain forever. There has to be someone groomed for the future. The franchise has developed multiple leaders, and for the next three games, we believe Riyan Parag is ready and capable of leading the side,” Sanju Samson told PTI in 2025.The 24-year-old has been with the IPL franchise for seven years but his best performance came in 2024 where he scored 573 runs in 16 games at an average of 52.09 and a healthy strike rate of 149.22. His IPL outings put him on the selectors' radar, earning him his first T20I and ODI caps for the country that same year.Under Parag, who became the youngest player to lead RR last season, the franchise is set to usher in a new era and hopes the long wait for the title — which was last won in the inaugural IPL edition under the late Shane Warne — will end.",India all-rounder Riyan Parag is all set to be named as the new Rajasthan Royals captain at 4pm today.

Team Canada again proved why they remain the favorites to win gold



Canada left no doubt about its gold medal credentials on Thursday. Jon Cooper's squad dismantled Czechia 5-0 in its opening game of the 2026 Winter Olympics, with contributions across all four lines, showcasing depth and skill at Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena.The tone was set before the first intermission when Macklin Celebrini tipped a Cale Makar blast from the blue line past Lukas Dostal with just 5.7 seconds remaining in the period. At 19 years old, Celebrini became the youngest Canadian NHLer ever to score a goal at the Olympics. But that was just the start for the side.Canada entered the tournament with a chip on its shoulder, and Celebrini made sure they lived up to the stakes. While the Czechs controlled the game in the first period, the Sharks’ youngster ensured his side had the lead by the end of the period.Meanwhile, Connor McDavid finished with three assists and a game-high six shots on goal, recording the first Olympic points of his career. Captain Sidney Crosby added two assists as he closed the gap between himself and Jarome Iginla for the most points by a Canadian at the Olympics.Thomas Harley led all skaters with 20 minutes and 35 seconds of ice time and chipped in two helpers of his own.After a competitive opening 20 minutes where shots were tied 11-11, Canada seized control in the second period.Mitch Marner made a spectacular individual play along the left wall, driving to the net and sliding a pass across the crease while falling over a sprawled David Spacek. Mark Stone was waiting at the far post for the easy tap-in to make it 2-0.Bo Horvat put the game out of reach minutes later, taking a feed from Brad Marchand at full speed through the neutral zone before going in alone and beating Dostal through the five-hole. Canada outshot Czechia 36-26 and won 55 percent of faceoffs in the lopsided victory.The third period belonged to Canada's stars. Nathan MacKinnon scored on the power play just 13 seconds after Dominik Kubalik was called for interference, finishing off a sequence that moved from Makar to Crosby to McDavid before reaching his stick.Nick Suzuki capped the scoring by redirecting a McDavid pass from point-blank range to complete the rout. The lone concern for Canada was defenseman Josh Morrissey, who left early in the second period and did not return.Shea Theodore slid into his spot alongside Colton Parayko. No injury replacement can be added now that the tournament has started.

‘Terrifying’ Olympic Ski Star Lindsey Vonn’s Crash Seen In Shocking Photos

Quote of the day:

I'm never tired of winning, and I'm never tired of skiing.""

NEW DELHI: The words echo with the fierce determination that has defined one of alpine skiing’s greatest champions.For Lindsey Vonn , winning has never just been about medals, it has been about resilience, comeback, and an unrelenting hunger to push boundaries.Just days after a devastating crash at the Milan Cortina Games, Vonn delivered another powerful reminder of her mindset, updating fans from her hospital bed after undergoing a “successful” third surgery on her broken left leg.“I had my 3rd surgery today and it was successful. Success today has a completely different meaning than it did a few days ago,” Vonn wrote on Instagram, sharing photos of herself giving a thumbs-up with a metal frame stabilising her leg. “I’m making progress and while it is slow, I know I’ll be ok.”Earlier this month, during the Winter Olympics, the 41-year-old skiing legend crashed just 13 seconds into her downhill run and was airlifted off the course, later revealing a complex tibia fracture that would require multiple surgeries.The setback came just nine days after she ruptured the ACL in the same knee yet another chapter in a career marked by extraordinary highs and punishing injuries.Vonn’s comeback story had already captivated fans worldwide.After nearly six years of retirement, she returned to competitive skiing in December 2024 following knee surgery earlier that year.Heading into the Olympics, she was in sensational form, winning two downhills, finishing on the podium in seven of eight World Cup races, and proving she could still dominate the speed events.Doctors noted that her injury required external fixation, a technique used to stabilise severe fractures, but Vonn’s spirit remained unbroken.Surrounded by family and flooded with messages of support, she thanked medical staff, friends, and fans, while also cheering on her Team USA teammates from her hospital room.Billie Jean King hailed her as “Forever the champion,” while Allyson Felix sent messages of love and encouragement.Teammates called her “the baddest there is,” reflecting the respect she commands across the sporting world.“I’m never tired of winning” may sound like a simple statement, but in Vonn’s journey, it represents far more than trophies. It symbolises an athlete who refuses to surrender—to injury, to age, or to doubt.","Lindsey Vonn updates fans from her hospital bed after undergoing a ‘successful’ third surgery on her broken left leg.

You still have to go out there and perform, and he did just that.""The player exhibited exceptional skill and talent, particularly during the first period, when he faced 11 shots and made a couple of key saves on Tomas Hertl (Vegas Golden Knights) and another on David Pastrnak (Boston Bruins) when the game was tight.Interestingly, this match was Binnington’s first international game after scoring 31 saves in a 3-2 overtime win over the United States in the championship of the 4 Nations Face-Off.",Jordan Binnington recorded a 26-save shutout in his Olympic debut against Czechia.

Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson react emotionally after costly free dance error at Winter Olympics

Auld Lang Syne

I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles)

Lilah Fear stood on the Olympic ice with dreams of a historic medal for Team GB. But within moments, everything changed. The 26-year-old ice dancer became emotional after a small mistake during the free dance routine ended the pair’s medal hopes at the Winter Olympics. Skating with partner Lewis Gibson, Fear later admitted she was in shock and struggling to understand what had happened.The British duo had been performing strongly and were placed fourth after the rhythm dance. That position kept them close to a podium finish and raised hopes across Team GB. However, an error early in the free dance brought negative scores from judges and pushed them down to seventh place overall. The sudden fall in the standings left Fear tearful during interviews as she tried to process the moment and the lost opportunity for an Olympic medal.Fear spoke honestly after the routine and did not hide her disappointment. She said, “I can’t believe it happened. I’m replaying it in my head and it’s just such a shame. I don’t really have the words yet. It will take me some time to process. I can’t believe I just did that. I feel so bad, I’m devastated. I’m in shock. It’s such a shame because I know what we’re capable of. I just feel so bad.”The pair had hoped to become the first Team GB ice skaters to win an Olympic medal since Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean took bronze in 1994. Their Scottish-themed free dance included music such asand. But during a rotation, Fear lost balance, and the technical mistake proved costly.Reflecting on the moment, Fear explained, “Just a really costly technical mistake, which was tough very early in the programme because I knew that we kinda lost bronze at that point. But I also really wanted to not let the Olympic experience just disappear because of that. It’s not what we’ve trained, and it was costly and devastating.”Gibson also shared his feelings, saying, “When you don’t perform the way you want to, on any day, it’s tough to take but at the Olympic Games, it’s even harder. I think we’ll look back at this one day and learn from it. We do that at every event. We’ll just move forward.”Despite the disappointment, the pair’s strong journey to the Olympics and their honest reaction showed courage in a painful moment on sport’s biggest stage.",Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson had hoped to become the first Team GB ice skaters to win an Olympic medal since Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean took bronze in 1994.

Luc Tardif hopes for Russian return but will follow IOC rules



The men's Olympic hockey tournament is underway in Milan without two of the sport's traditional powers. Russia and Belarus remain banned from international competition due to their involvement in the war in Ukraine, leaving a significant hole in what is supposed to be a best-on-best showcase.IIHF president Luc Tardif addressed the situation at a press conference on Thursday alongside NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and NHLPA executive director Marty Walsh. Tardif made clear where the federation stands on the matter.""We want as soon as possible the Belarusians and the Russians back,"" Tardif said. ""Because first, it will mean that the world will be a little bit better. But we follow the recommendation of the IOC."" The absence of Russian players is particularly notable given their recent Olympic success.The Russians made it to back-to-back finals in the last two editions. While the 2018 PyeongChang games got them the gold, the 2022 edition in Beijing brought them a Silver as the team remains one of the most dominant sides in the sport.But that dominance didn’t last for long, as in 2022 the IOC banned both Russia and Belarus following the former’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.While some athletes from both nations can compete as Individual Neutral Athletes in other sports after rigorous vetting, hockey's team format makes that pathway impossible.The IOC's March 2023 recommendation stated that ""a group of Individual Neutral Athletes cannot be considered a team."" The IIHF confirmed it would follow that guidance, effectively shutting the door on Russian and Belarusian hockey participation through at least the 2025-26 season.Tardif's comments reflect the IIHF's position throughout the ban. The federation has consistently maintained that it follows IOC directives rather than making independent decisions on Russian and Belarusian participation.The Russian Olympic Committee was suspended by the IOC in October 2023 for recognizing regional Olympic councils in Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine. That suspension remains in effect, and the IOC has shown no indication of lifting sanctions while the war continues.For now, the 12-team Olympic tournament proceeds without nations that have combined to win three of the last four Olympic hockey medals. The press conference came on Day 2 of the men's tournament, which features Canada, the United States, Finland, Sweden, and Czechia.",IIHF president Luc Tardif addressed the situation at a press conference on Thursday.

RGV Breaks Silence, Sparks Speculation Over Jai Ho Controversy With AR Rahman





Imagine driving through a road and suddenly music starts to play on the road. Sounds interesting and unique, right? Well brace yourself for the unique experience as India has got its first ever Musical Road on one of Mumbai’s most iconic routes, the coastal road. As tires run through the road, a familiar tune plays from the road. So, on 11 February 2026, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) introduced a 500-metre stretch on the Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj Coastal Road. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde were also present during the unveiling event. In fact, they also took a drive along the stretch to experience the musical effect firsthand.This is not your normal road anymore as it literally sings the globally-famous melody of “Jai Ho” as you drive over it. Let’s find more about this new musical update:The musical magic is taking place on the carriageway between Nariman Point and Worli.As the tyres of the vehicle roll over the grooves at the right speed (around 70–80 km/h), the interaction creates vibrations.Those vibrations turn into sound waves and the tune plays inside your car cabin!It completely depends on speed and tyre friction. If you go too slow or too fast, the tune will fade.The music isn’t a random choice. It was chosen for its patriotic theme and global recognition. Jai Ho is composed by Academy Award-winning artist A.R. Rahman for ‘Slumdog Millionaire’. In fact, the music maestro himself drove and made a video on the road. He shared his experience on X and wrote:Signboards are put before the musical strip so that drivers can adjust their speed.It encourages safer driving habits.The idea of musical roads has roots in other countries like Japan, Hungary, South Korea and the UAE. These countries too have musical roads.This road is an engineering marvel.It’s an interesting experience. When your vehicle is at the right speed, suddenly your car becomes a musical instrument on wheels. The tires are grooving, creating joyful music. There’s something surreal about this musical road. Whether you’re a Mumbaikar or just a curious traveller, this is one drive you can’t miss out on.: It is suggested to visit when the traffic is lighter. Preferably early mornings or late evenings as you can hear the tune nice and clear.: Right after emerging from the Nariman Point → Worli tunnel on the northbound Coastal Road.Mumbai’s musical road is more than just a gimmick or an offbeat attraction. The road also celebrates engineering creativity. So next time you are in Mumbai, do not forget to drive on this musical road!","India has got its first ever Musical Road on one of Mumbai’s most iconic routes, the coastal road.

Almost a year after JPMorgan made 5 days work from office compulsory and CEO Jamie Dimon said don't tell JPMorgan what to do at Townhall; some employees fear petition that they call ‘career ...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/almost-a-year-after-jpmorgan-made-5-days-work-from-office-compulsory-and-ceo-jamie-dimon-said-dont-tell-jpmorgan-what-to-do-at-townhall-some-employees-fear-petition-that-they-call-career-suicide/articleshow/128211254.cms,"When Jamie Dimon's angry outburst at Townhall went viral

In March 2026, it will be a year since America's biggest bank made 5-day work from office compulsory. The largest US bank, which employs more than 300,000 people globally, told all of its employees to return to the office five days a week starting in March, ending a hybrid work-from-home policy that took effect during the pandemic. Just days after CEO Jamie Dimon's order to all employees to come into the office five days a week, a petition surfaced. The petition, which was part of complaints over JP Morgan's call to bring employees back to office 5 days a week, asked CEO Dimon to reverse the change. The petition that continues to be live online is addressed to chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. In the petition, employees have complained about losing hybrid working arrangements. ""Some employees sought advice from the Communications Workers of America on how they might set up a labor union, a rare thing in the US finance sector.And now a year since the petition was set up, it has about 2,000 signatories out of the Bank's more than 300,000 global employees. According to a report in Financial Times, there are some who believe that signing the petition will be a ‘career suicide’. The report details internal backlash to the 5-day mandate.As per the report, employees at the America's largest lender told the Financial Times they were bewildered by management’s insistence on a full-time return to company offices, though teams are scattered across the globe. “My team is spread out through two continents and three time zones,” said a JPMorgan employee who signed a petition to bring back hybrid work. “JPMorgan is a global company — why can’t that include my home office?” “Hybrid is working and employees love the happy medium,” the staffer told the FT. ""We, the workers of JPMorganChase (JPMC), are concerned about the future of our workplace - its integrity, employee satisfaction, and the increasing toxicity that has metastasized in our company culture in the last couple of months,"" reads the petition.Dimon announced the five-day return to office policy on January 10, 2025, ahead of a March 2025 start date. Soon after announcing the change, Dimon went viral for angry outburst he had about the employee petition during a Town Hall meeting. When asked about the in-person work policy during the staff meeting, he said, ""Don't waste time on it. I don't care how many people sign that fucking petition,"" he said, drawing some laughter. Instead, Dimon demanded more efficiency and stressed employees have a choice whether to work at JPMorgan. The CEO told them not to be mad at him, and said it was a free country.Dimon, who has run the lender for 19 years, said some staff did not pay attention during Zoom meetings, which reduced their efficiency and creativity. In-office requirements will not be left up to managers, Dimon said. ""There is no chance that I will leave it up to managers,"" he said. ""Zero chance.

Crash and a tough race day for Breezy Johnson turns romantic with marriage proposal



American skier Breezy Johnson experienced one of the most emotional days of her career at the Winter Olympics in Cortina d’Ampezzo. Just days after winning the women’s downhill gold medal, the 30-year-old added a personal milestone. Her boyfriend, Connor Watkins, proposed at the finish area of the super-G course. Surrounded by athletes and officials, Johnson became emotional and accepted the ring. The proposal happened shortly after she crashed out of the super-G race.The moment created a sharp contrast between sport and personal life. Johnson had entered the event hoping for another medal but could not finish the race. Earlier in the week, she narrowly missed a podium in the team combined event with Mikaela Shiffrin. Watkins had also been in the stands cheering during her downhill victory. Johnson has previously shared publicly that she is bisexual and said she chose to openly share her identity with fans.Connor Watkins wore a USA team jacket and knelt near the finish line. He held out a silver ring with a blue stone in the center as reported by NBC News . Breezy Johnson covered her sunglasses with her hand and became tearful. After she said yes, the couple embraced while teammates applauded nearby.The proposal followed a difficult race. More than a dozen skiers failed to finish the super-G. Johnson was among them after losing control on the demanding course. Fog covered part of the upper section of the mountain. The slope, usually considered manageable, became risky. Many racers carried too much speed and skidded out.Two other Americans, Jackie Wiles and Keely Cashman, also competed, along with Mary Bocock. However, the United States stayed far from the podium. Italian favorite Federica Brignone delivered a powerful early run. She clocked 1 minute, 31.41 seconds and no one could beat the time. France’s Romane Miradoli took silver while Austria’s Laura Pirovano claimed bronze.Italy’s Sofia Goggia and Germany’s Emma Aicher were also among the contenders. New Zealand’s Alice Robinson chased her country’s first Alpine Olympic medal in decades but fell short.Johnson’s Olympic week still remained memorable. She joined Lindsey Vonn as the only American women to win downhill gold at the Games. Despite the crash and missed medals, she left the mountain with a championship title, and a wedding to plan!","Breezy Johnson won the women's downhill gold medal at the Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo.

The first big lineup choice made by Team United States before the men's ice hockey event at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics is that Connor Hellebuyck would be the starting goalie in the first game. The announcement also occurs as the team is to carry on with high expectations and momentum following the recent international competitions at the start of the Group-stage action.Head coach Mike Sullivan stressed the trust in the depth of the goaltending of the roster, but affirmed that Hellebuyck would be the first to play between the pipes.

His latest season in the NHL has been characterized by both victories and losses, but Hellebuyck continues to be one of the most successful goalkeepers in the league, who has been consistent and effective in high-pressure situations.According to Mike Sullivan, the decision was part of a bigger game plan concerning the fact that the tight schedule of the tournament may result in the rotation between Jeremy Swayman of the Boston Bruins and Jake Oettinger of the Dallas Stars.The two are still major alternatives in the future.As this NHL match preview can introduce excitement, Team United States wants to create an initial dominance in group play with the help of Hellebuyck and his experience, constituting the foundation of defensive and establishing a confident tone to the rest of the Olympic campaign.",Connor Hellebuyck of the Winnipeg Jets is scheduled to play in goal as Team United States is playing its first match with Team Latvia in the Olympics.

Alexandre Texier remains the only hope for losing Team France



France is hanging in there at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena, but time is running out for them. Switzerland maintains a comfortable 2-0 heading into the third period of their Olympic opener, a game that could have easily been a blowout given the talent disparity.Instead, France has made the 2025 World Championship silver medalists work harder than expected for what still looks like an inevitable victory. Forward Alexandre Texier remains the only NHL talent on the French squad, and the national side is depending on him to turn this game.The problem for France is clear. Their attack has been largely limited to perimeter shots, unable to penetrate a stingy Swiss defense anchored by NHL veterans Roman Josi and Jonas Siegenthaler. That lack of quality chances puts even more pressure on Alexandre Texier to step up.The Montreal Canadiens forward is France's only active NHL player on the roster, and his country needs him now more than ever. Texier has posted 18 points in 38 games this season between St. Louis and Montreal, showing he can produce at the highest level.But translating that to the Olympic stage in Milan against elite competition is another challenge entirely.TSN's Pierre LeBrun noted during the second intermission that France needs to find more looks offensively if they want any chance of a comeback.Much of their attack has come from low-danger areas, playing right into Switzerland's defensive structure. Switzerland entered this tournament with 10 NHL players and a championship pedigree from back-to-back World Championship finals appearances.Their goaltending tandem of Akira Schmid, Leonardo Genoni, and Reto Berra gives them the depth to lock down games like this one. Genoni was named MVP of the 2025 World Championship after posting four shutouts in seven games. That kind of stinginess has carried over to Milan.Even if France falls in this one, their Olympic journey is far from over. They face Czechia on Friday before a daunting matchup against Sidney Crosby and Canada on Sunday. For Texier and his teammates, these final few minutes against Switzerland represent a chance to build momentum regardless of the final score.Slovakia already pulled an upset yesterday, and if Texier and his team can turn this game around, France will have the chance to repeat that against another powerhouse. For the Swiss, however, if they win, it signals a great start to their Olympic campaign.","Switzerland leads France 2-0 going into the third period of their Olympic opener.

Will BTS Take Over From Bad Bunny?

(Image via Getty)

BTS and a full K-Pop moment are the loudest early demand

Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber give the NFL the safe nuclear option

Jay-Z and a Roc Nation flex would turn halftime into a power play

So who actually feels most likely to follow Bad Bunny right now?

A BTS-led K-Pop takeover, with BLACKPINK and others, if the NFL decides it has to chase young global viewers at all costs.



A Swift or Bieber headliner if the league wants maximum reach with minimum political headache.



A Jay-Z or Pharrell-and-friends show if Roc Nation wants to turn SoFi into an industry summit.

Bad Bunny just blew up Super Bowl LX. His Apple Music halftime show at Levi’s Stadium pulled record TV and streaming numbers, sparked a week of political outrage and turned 12 minutes of Spanish-language music into the story of the night.Now the league and Roc Nation have to find someone to walk into that fire next. Super Bowl LXI lands at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif., on Feb. 14, 2027, and every outlet from Billboard to SB Nation and Complex is already throwing darts at the board.Billboard’s fan poll is not a Vegas line, but it shows where the online hunger is. In that poll, BTS sit north of 80% of the vote, with BLACKPINK, Taylor Swift, Morgan Wallen, Post Malone, Harry Styles, Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, Drake, Lil Wayne and Jay-Z all miles behind.That lines up with SB Nation’s idea of an outright K-Pop ode at SoFi. Their writers floated BTS anchoring the show, with BLACKPINK on a reunion run and even a fictional band from K-Pop Demon Hunters dropped into the mix.If the NFL decides the only way to top Bad Bunny’s global reach is to lean straight into Korean pop and TikTok culture, this is the move. It is risky for a league that still treats anything non-English like a science experiment, but it is also the clearest path to numbers that look bigger than 2026.SB Nation’s first two names are Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber, for a reason. Roger Goodell has already said the league would welcome Swift at halftime, and the math is obvious: if you want the broadest possible audience, you call the woman who just rewired the touring economy.The hold-up is not demand, it is timing. Swift told Jimmy Fallon in 2025 that she is not eager to build halftime choreography while Travis Kelce is still getting hit every week, and that concern has not magically disappeared. Until she says otherwise, Swift feels like the league’s dream, not its plan.Justin Bieber is different. He just crushed a Grammys performance, sits among the top global streamers and has more than 15 years of hits to stitch into a 12-minute medley. With the Super Bowl falling on Valentine’s Day in 2027, a Bieber-heavy pop set full of stadium sing-alongs is the kind of “nobody gets mad at this” choice the NFL loves.Complex’s early list leans into something more political: a Jay-Z moment. Hov has overseen the halftime era that ran from Shakira and Jennifer Lopez to Rihanna and now Bad Bunny. At Super Bowl LX, he even walked the field in a hoodie that read “The game needs me.”Letting him finally take the stage in Los Angeles would double as a victory lap for Roc Nation and a way to quiet fans who still see the partnership as corporate damage control. A Jay-Z show also opens the door to a Pharrell-style friends set, which Complex floated as another option, stacking guests like The Weeknd or Drake around one producer’s catalogue.It would not match the chaos of Bad Bunny’s political staging, but it would send a clear message about who really calls the shots on Super Bowl Sunday.If you strip away fan wars and stan polls, a few lanes stand out in mid-February 2026:Public betting and prediction markets are already tossing out names like Bieber, Chappell Roan and others, but as of today there is no official decision from the league.","Super Bowl LXI lands at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif., on Feb. 14, 2027.

Stefon Diggs vs. Cardi B: Everything We Know About the Post-Super Bowl Split



The Super Bowl may be over but the real drama for New England Patriots star Stefon Diggs is just beginning. Following a tough loss to the Seattle Seahawks on February 11, 2026, Diggs dropped a bomb on Instagram: a long, cryptic post that has everyone buzzing about his relationship with Cardi B Diggs’ 20-slide carousel was packed with deep quotes and personal photos. His caption spoke volumes: ""Gratitude and fear cannot coexist in the same space... a reminder to control what you can control, remain thankful, and stay motivated.""Slides like ""The best way to appreciate something is to be without it for a while"" only added to the mystery. He even turned off comments, a move that screamed, ""I’m trying to avoid the noise.""But it wasn’t just the words. The post hit right after Diggs and Cardi B reportedly unfollowed each other on Instagram. This online split sent fans into a frenzy, convinced that the power couple was done. And while a viral screenshot of them supposedly trading insults was fake, the tension was very real.Then came the real kicker: buried in those slides were photos of Diggs with Baby Snoop, his son with K’yanna Barber. This wasn't a small detail.K’yanna had been spotted at the Super Bowl itself, cheering on Diggs with Baby Snoop in a tiny Patriots jersey, while Cardi B was busy performing at halftime. The timing of Diggs featuring K'yanna's son in his ""post-loss statement"" felt like a direct message.This move felt especially loaded because of Diggs' complicated family life. In 2025 alone, he reportedly had four children with four different women, including a son with Cardi B, nicknamed ""Baby Brim."" Now, with six children, his family dynamics are under a microscope.Many are seeing the inclusion of Baby Snoop as a significant factor in the rumored split. Rumors suggested Cardi B had given Diggs a ""one more mistake and I'm out"" warning. Seeing K’yanna so openly supported, both at the game and on his Instagram feed, might have been that final straw.The question now is, what’s next for Stefon Diggs and Cardi B? Their relationship seems to have hit a major roadblock, and Diggs' recent post has done little to calm the storm. If anything, it’s intensified the speculation that this high-profile romance is officially over.","Stefon Diggs and Cardi B reportedly unfollowed each other on Instagram.

Veteran forward Tomas Tatar has reportedly warned Team Slovakia ahead of their match against Italy, as he believes that it is not going to be an easy matchup against the host nation in the upcoming Winter Olympics men's hockey game. Following a win with a 4-1 score over Finland, Tatar has emphasized the need for focus ahead of Friday's showdown at the Milano Rho Ice Hockey Arena.According to the NHL, Team Slovakia also feels that they still have work to do in Group B at the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026. The team is meanwhile planning to maintain full intensity without easing up, even after a win.Tomas Tatar is serving as the captain and one of the marquee players who has proved it with his skills, playing techniques, and game planning strategy. He has been one of the key contributors to Slovakia's win against Finland, with an assist in 16:33 of ice time on Slovakia's top line, alongside his team members Juraj Slafkovsky and Adam Ruzicka. Team Slovakia captain Tomas Tatar has asked his team to bring on full focus and intensity in Friday's Group B matchup against host nation Italy at the 2026 Winter Olympic Games, saying that the host country, Italy, should not be underestimated at this level of competition.Team Slovakia will play its second match after its 4-1 victory against Finland. Meanwhile, Italy lost 5-2 to Sweden on Wednesday at the preliminaries, but the game was tied 2-2 until late in the second period, as reported by NHL.com.Sharing about Italy’s team strength, the veteran forward stated, ""We watched the game ... they were good. Everybody at this level is playing really well. I don't think any team can come here and feel like it's going to be an easy ride. It's a battle every game, and we have to be ready. I'm going to talk to the guys, and I'm going to try to make sure the team is the best prepared for the game.""Adding further, if the team follows the planned strategy and executes it, they can continue their chase for Gold. ""I think it just showed to our group that if we do everything we planned for the game and we stick to the system and we don't look for individual (success), we play collectively as a team, we can do some damage,"" the 14-year NHL veteran and Slovakia’s captain said. ""I bet on us in every game in this tournament, and very happy we showed it to ourselves and proved it to ourselves that we can play,"" he further added.As for Tatar’s profile, he has 30 points (seven goals, 23 assists) in 36 games this season with Zug in the National League, the top professional league in Switzerland.

Team Canada ’s offensive lineup becomes too much for Czechia to handle



Macklin Celebrini just keeps making history. The San Jose Sharks phenom tipped home a Cale Makar blast from the blue line with 5.7 seconds remaining in the first period, giving Canada a 1-0 lead over Czechia in their Olympic opener at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena on Thursday.The goal made Celebrini the youngest Canadian NHLer to score at the Olympics, adding another line to an already remarkable resume. The timing could not have been better. Czechia had kept Canada's star-studded lineup off the board through nearly 20 minutes, with Lukáš Dostál turning aside chance after chance.Czechia tried hard to defend, but they just couldn’t survive Canada’s firepower. Makar wound up from the point, and Celebrini got just enough of his stick on the puck to redirect it past the Anaheim netminder. It was a gut punch for the Czechs heading into the intermission.What had been an evenly contested affair in the first period turned into a demolition in the second. Mark Stone doubled the lead at the 6:40 mark of the middle frame, finishing off a spectacular play from Mitch Marner.The Toronto forward collected the puck on the left wall, drove to the net, and slid a perfect pass across the crease while falling over a laid-out David Špaček.Stone was waiting at the far post for an easy tap-in.

T20 World Cup | Tilak Varma provides update on Abhishek's fitness, mindset during rehab

NEW DELHI: India put up another commanding all-round performance, thrashing Namibia by 93 runs in their T20 World Cup encounter on Thursday to register their second consecutive victory of the tournament. Powered by aggressive half-centuries from Ishan Kishan and Hardik Pandya , the defending champions piled up a daunting 209/9 before bowling Namibia out for 116 in 18.2 overs.After the match, Pandya reflected on his form and preparation, saying, “Yeah, definitely, just enjoying the sport. Had a good couple of months to prepare and, you know, get the rhythm and, you know, get the body right. Thus far everything is going well.” Highlighting how much his batting means to him, he added, “Yes, I've always taken pride in my batting as an all-rounder. So whenever I get an opportunity, I make sure that both the skills are managed rightly… batting is always close to my heart. And when that comes, it's a, you know, if you add the more sugar to the cake.”Pandya also elaborated on the effort that goes into staying in peak physical condition. “Body has been fantastic. I've always mentioned it takes a lot of hard work, which I cherish. But, you know, playing for the country has always been a pride, always been my number priority,” he said.“A lot of work goes behind the scene where I'm kind of out and kind of go into army, army sort of a camp where I do morning, evening sessions… make sure I eat well, make sure I sleep well, make sure my habits are good. ”Put in to bat, India began in explosive fashion, with Kishan in particularly commanding form. The left-hander went on the attack from the outset, hammering 61 off just 24 balls and reaching his half-century in only 20 deliveries as India surged past 100 within the first seven overs.Pandya then anchored the middle phase with authority, striking a polished 52 off 28 balls and adding a vital 81-run partnership for the fifth wicket with Shivam Dube (23 off 16), allowing India to keep the scoreboard ticking despite periodic setbacks.Namibia captain Gerhard Erasmus stood out with the ball, employing smart variations to return career-best figures of 4/20. His spell helped stem the flow late in the innings as India lost five wickets for just four runs, but the target remained well beyond Namibia’s reach.Chasing 210, Namibia failed to match the required tempo, even though a few batters showed promise at the start. Varun Chakravarthy was exceptional with the ball, finishing with impressive figures of 3/7 from two overs.India had opened their campaign with a win over the USA, followed it up with this emphatic victory against Namibia, and will now turn their attention to a high-voltage clash against arch-rivals Pakistan on Sunday in Colombo.",India thrash Namibia by 93 runs in their T20 World Cup encounter.

Taylor Swift tops 2027 Super Bowl halftime show wish list in new NFL fan poll,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/taylor-swift-tops-2027-super-bowl-halftime-show-wish-list-in-new-nfl-fan-poll/articleshow/128269051.cms,"(Getty Images)

A recent NFL fan poll shows Taylor Swift leading the 2027 Super Bowl halftime show wish list

The 2026 Super Bowl just ended and fans are already jumping into 2027. And yes, Taylor Swift is right in the middle of the conversation. A recent fan poll of NFL supporters shows the global pop superstar as the most wanted headliner for the 2027 Super Bowl halftime show. Swift reportedly led in total votes, across the most U.S. states, and among multiple NFL fanbases. But before Swifties start planning their watch parties, here’s what this really means.According to a survey of roughly 3,000 NFL fans conducted by VegasInsider.com, Taylor Swift finished as the top choice for the 2027 Super Bowl halftime show. She received the highest percentage of overall votes compared to other artists included in the poll.The survey data also showed that Swift led in the most U.S. states and across the most NFL team fanbases. In simple terms, she wasn’t just popular in one region, her support appeared nationwide. That’s a big deal when you’re talking about the Super Bowl halftime show, which is one of the most-watched live entertainment events in the world.It’s not hard to see why Taylor Swift is dominating Super Bowl halftime conversations.Over the past two NFL seasons, her presence at games has brought major crossover attention from pop culture fans to football. Her appearances at Kansas City Chiefs games created viral moments, boosted viewership numbers, and sparked nonstop social media chatter.Beyond the NFL connection, Swift’s career alone makes her a strong candidate in fan discussions. She has a massive catalog of hits, record-breaking tours, and a global audience. The Super Bowl halftime stage typically goes to artists with cross-generational appeal and stadium-level performance power, two boxes Swift clearly checks.Here’s the reality check: there has been no official announcement from the NFL, Roc Nation, or Taylor Swift regarding the 2027 Super Bowl halftime show.Halftime performers are usually revealed much closer to the event. At this stage, the 2027 headliner remains completely unconfirmed. Fan polls like this one are common in the lead-up to major events, but they do not influence or confirm booking decisions in any official way.In other words, Swift topping a wish list does not mean she is set to headline.But until the NFL makes an official announcement, it remains just that — a wish list.","A recent fan poll of NFL supporters shows the global pop superstar as the most wanted headliner for the 2027 Super Bowl halftime show.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

NEW DELHI: When Aishwary Tomar took the last shot in the 50m men’s Rifle 3 Position final, he was fractionally behind Niraj Kumar. Just 0.2 points separated the two at the top, effectively making the final shot the decider for the gold medal. Tomar kept his calm and banked on his experience to fire a 10.7 compared to Niraj’s 10.3, securing the top place by the finest of margins.The scenario at the Asian Rifle and Pistol Championships here was not new for Tomar. He was in the exact same situation during the 2025 Cairo Worlds final, only then, his role was reversed. Heading into the final shot in November, it was the 25-year-old Indian who was leading by 0.1 points against Yikun Liu of China. He wilted under pressure and hit 9.8 compared to the Chinese’s 10.1 to lose the gold by 0.2 points. “It still hurts. You come so far and don’t become world champion. That takes time to process,” Aishwary reflected after India took all three medals on Thursday.Aishwary bagged the gold at 362.0, a world record in an event in which the final was contested in a recently introduced format. Niraj settled for silver with 361.8, while Akhil Sheoran, who was eliminated before the final shot, won the bronze with 343.5.India also claimed the team gold with Japan and Kazakhstan winning silver and bronze respectively.Aishwary said he was under pressure to overtake the leader. “When you are behind, you have to shoot very well to catch up, so the pressure is high,” he said, “There are many matches where Niraj and I are left till the end. We are learning how to handle that.”Niraj said he gave his all in the shot. “I gave my best. My position was stable and everything felt right. I can’t really explain why I lost. Because of that, I got silver. But I thought it was a good shot. But I will still say that I need to work 200 per cent harder to handle pressure situations,” the 26-year-old tried to explain the situation. Aishwary said that though he was disappointed about missing out on world championship gold, the silver gave him much-needed confidence. “Before that, I didn’t have a medal at the Worlds. After winning it, I felt we could win at that level. It’s equivalent to the Olympics. If you lose, you can use it as motivation — to go one step further in the next Worlds.”TOPS support can help me do better: NirajNiraj hopes that his show at the Asian Championship would help him return to sports ministry’s Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS). Niraj said he stopped receiving benefits last year. “My performance was good last year too, but I was removed from the TOPS team. I don’t get government support anymore. I’m struggling.,” he said. “I used old ammunition from the Navy. That caused a lot of problems in training.”","Just 0.2 points separated the two at the top, effectively making the final shot the decider for the gold medal.

T20 World Cup: Namibia's Gerhard Erasmus upset after lack of night practice before India match

The Supreme Court-mandated Justice Lodha reforms that forced the BCCI to have separate teams for each state has, one could argue, produced mixed results. Though Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram have remained punching bags with records being re-written at their expense, teams like Uttarakhand have punched above their weight.The Central Zone team defeated Jharkhand by an innings and reached their maiden Ranji Trophy semifinals last week to get there. Based in Dehradun, but playing their Feb 15-19 semifinals against Karnataka in Lucknow due to lack of stadium, the berth is not a fluke — Uttarakhand had reached the quarterfinals twice since they enjoyed the separate existence in 2018. Rishabh Pant , Aysuh Badoni and Anuj Raw-at are just some of the names that belong from Uttarakhand, a part of Uttar Pradesh as recently as 2000.Navneet Mishra, manager of the Ranji team, told TOI, “We don’t have money, bank balance or infra-structure. But we have junoon.” They don’t have their selectors either. Mahim Verma, secretary of Cricket Association of Uttarakhand, said, “Our constitution warrants that selectors should have a minimum experience of 25 first-class matches. We don’t have such people. But maybe it’s better to have selectors from outside as there is less pressure and headache.” Three of their selectors, including chairman, belong to J&K, Himachal Pradesh and Assam.Though the state’s coaching partnership with former India and Mumbai batting stalwart Wasim Jaffer ended on a bitter note in 2021, their decision to rope in Manish Jha as head coach — originally from Bengal, played for Services, based in Delhi and having coaching experience with Manipur and Del-hi U-23s — has worked.“We were earlier preparing for the Ranji season by playing limited overs matches. That was not in tune with our goal. I started multi-day red-ball practice matches among Ranji probables and U-23 players. The players used to go for the slog eyeing an IPL contract,” said Jha.“But this (red-ball, multi-day) is the actual format of cricket. These matches have helped players get into the correct mindset. We have worked a lot on the fitness of all the players.“The training programme and indoor nets (June 15 to Sept 15 are three months of heavy rains) have also helped,” he added.","The Supreme Court-mandated Justice Lodha reforms that forced the BCCI to have separate teams for each state has, one could argue, produced mixed results.

45/1 to 77/6 against the USA. 205/4 to 209/9 against Namibia.India won their first two T20 World Cup contests rather convincingly but two batting collapses, occurring at different junctures of the game, should serve as a wake-up call for the batters ahead of the game against Pakistan on February 15 in Colombo.In both matches, the word from the Indian camp remained constant. They expected the wicket to be flatter and behave a certain way but the sluggishness in Mumbai and the odd low bounce in Delhi caught them off guard. Colombo is expected to be no different and will require a lot of adaptation and unlearning for a destructive batting unit which has feasted on batting paradises in the bilateral fixtures which preceded the multi-nation tournament.The sample size isn't that big but both Shadley van Schalkwyk and Gerhard Erasmus have provided a blueprint to the remaining teams. If you must stop this marauding Indian unit, be tactically smart: mix up your approach and have different plans ready.This Indian XI boasts of as many as five, even six when Abhishek Sharma played the first game, left-handers in the top-eight but they are all different. What works for Ishan Kishan may not work for Abhishek and a similar plan will not get the job done for the likes of Tilak Varma, Shivam Dube, Rinku Singh and Axar Patel.From their approach to hitting arcs to technicalities, there is very little similarity, which makes it all the more important to have clear and precise plans for each one.Schalkwyk mixed up his bumpers based on advice from his USA teammates and Erasmus was very smart in using angles, different release points and the crease. The delivery which got Tilak Varma took forever to reach the India batter because the bowler released it from far behind the crease. Even the step-out didn't achieve the desired connection. Namibia coach Craig Williams praised his skipper, lauding his ability to deliver the toughest overs of an innings.""He trains incredibly hard at all these variations, and I think - he plays cricket around the world in some leagues and bowls all the difficult overs, he bowls some really tough overs. And, he's continuously working on his game and trying to see how he can be more effective against batters. And I think tonight, again, against a world-class cricket team, he showed the world again what he's got and his execution was just really good tonight.""I think his first three overs went for 16 or something and then to bowl that 19th over as all under pressure - first ball going for six and then pulling it back, I think it was just really fantastic so I'm really happy for him he trains hard and he works hard at these variations in his game,"" said Williams at the post-match press conference.Erasmus certainly came prepared. While the occasional sling in the action can disrupt a batter's concentration, Ishan felt it only takes a couple of balls to get used to it and clear it from one's mind. Does it affect the plans to go big? Not really!""It might play in your head for a couple of balls, but I think at this level you need to have trust on your own strength as well. Even if he is trying to do something, we can go for sixes or boundaries at the same time. So important thing is how we are thinking at that point of time when the bowler is trying to do something different. But if we are just looking for boundaries and sixes and we are believing in our own strength I think that helps the batters more so we are just doing trying to keep it simple yeah some batters might score on, some batters won't but it's part of game and you keep on learning game by game,"" said Kishan.India were set for another big total vs Namibia but ran out of steam in the last two overs, losing five wickets and added just four runs off the ten deliveries they faced. The set pair of Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube departed off consecutive balls, Axar Patel didn't score, and the ending starkly contrasted the explosive start Ishan and Sanju Samson provided.Ishan echoed the team's sentiment on the pitch but felt the unit fared well with the bat and appreciated the opposition for executing their plans under pressure. The wicketkeeper-batter expects his side to take learnings from this fixture into the remaining games of the tournament.""I think they batted pretty well. In both the wickets, I feel it was a bit different from what we expected to happen. And today, looking at the death overs, when we were not able to regularly hit big sixes, I think we need to also give credit to Namibia bowlers because they were bang on with their yorkers, they were bang on with their slow ones.""So yeah it was a good learning maybe if some other team is doing the same thing maybe we can use the crease more or we can do something different which can irritate the bowler. So it was a good learning in this game and especially I think It was not about our batters not able to hit sixes, but it was more of them bowling very well in the death overs,"" explained Ishan.The USA had India on the mat, Namibia had their moments and an immediate course correction with the bat is needed to cover all bases against a spin-heavy Pakistan, who have already experienced the Colombo strip.The Suryakumar Yadav-led unit has bludgeoned attacks in the build-up to the World Cup but what worked yesterday may not work today and tomorrow is always a dive into the unknown. The muscle memory of tonking bowlers on flat pitches will need a quick unlearn as Colombo, and remainder of the tournament, may not follow the script everyone is so used to seeing played on loop.India's remaining opponents would surely have noted the cracks that both the USA and Namibia exposed.","India won their first two T20 World Cup contests rather convincingly. But two batting collapses, occurring at different junctures of the game, should serve as a wake-up call for the batters.

T20 World Cup | Jonathan Trott press conference after loss vs South Africa

Poll Do you think Afghanistan can learn from this Super Over defeat? Absolutely! Maybe, but it will take time No, it's too demoralizing Not sure

There are some defeats that can crush you. For Afghanistan, it was one such afternoon in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.The double Super Over loss to South Africa, that has all but ended the team’s T20 World Cup campaign, may seem the end of the world for now. But Afghanistan should take heart from the fact that it was their famed fighting spirit, so intrinsic to their cricket, that kept them in the game against all odds.It’s not that Afghanistan haven’t endured heartbreaking losses before. The 2023 ODI World Cup defeat to Australia following Glenn Maxwell’s superheroics at the Wankhede probably cost them a place in the semifinals. The 2024 T20 World Cup semifinal defeat to South Africa was more sobering, but in this defeat, there was hardly anything that the Afghans could have done differently. Maybe just one thing — their choice of bowler in at least one of the Super Overs. Rashid Khan, their talisman for years and still considered one of the best in T20 cricket, chose to intriguingly keep himself away from the action.Rashid is somebody who used to bowl in the Powerplay for fun. However, in both losses in this World Cup, the superstar didn’t bowl in the first six overs. His decision to avoid the pressure cooker of a Super Over was slightly baffling, more so since South Africa opted for Keshav Maharaj in the second Super Over.Rashid, who has presented Afghanistan with many memorable moments, wasn’t asked why he kept himself away. Nor was coach Jonathan Trott made to face the question, but it remains to be asked, is Rashid still the bowler he used to be?The question is pertinent because the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad is a ground that the bowler knows like the back of his palm. Rashid plays for Gujarat Titans in the IPL and has immense experience of Indian conditions. He took 2-28 during the South African chase and was Afghanistan’s most economical bowler during the 20 overs. And most importantly, no other bowler in his team generates the fear factor that he does.Yet Azmatullah Omarzai was asked to bowl the second Super Over and the 24 the medium-pacer conceded really made the task immensely difficult. But one player who still made a fight out of it was Rahmanullah Gurbaz.The three sixes that Gurbaz hit off Maharaj showed his strength of character as it followed his 42-ball 84 during Afghanistan’s chase.The 24-year-old has been the lynchpin of the Afghan batting lineup for a while now.Coach Trott felt that the kind of talent Gurbaz has, he should come up with more such performances.“It’s probably the best innings I’ve seen him play and it’s unfortunate he couldn’t get us over the line. With the amount of talent, physique, sporting ability and natural hand-eye coordination that he has, it’s about going forward for him now.“He wears his heart on his sleeve and over the years, I have just tried to get him to be a little more consistent in everything that he does,” Trott said.With time, it will be interesting to see if Gurbaz gets more responsibility, taking the baton from Rashid and turning Afghanistan into a team that deals with the crunch moments a little bit better.","Afghanistan lost to South Africa in the T20 World Cup quarter-final in Ahmedabad.
