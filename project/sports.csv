Jason Kelce banned by ESPN from YouTube’s Chargers vs Chiefs coverage after enforcement of strict new rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jason-kelce-banned-by-espn-from-youtubes-chargers-vs-chiefs-coverage-after-enforcement-of-strict-new-rules/articleshow/123593254.cms,"Jason Kelce (Getty Images)

ESPN restricts Jason Kelce from making guest appearance

Why YouTube wanted Jason Kelce for Chiefs opener



The NFL’s 2025 season opener between the Los Angeles Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs is shaping up to be a spectacle — not just on the field but also behind the scenes in the broadcast world. While YouTube secured a Hall of Fame quarterback to headline its exclusive coverage of the Week 1 clash in São Paulo, Brazil, fans hoping to see Jason Kelce join the stream will be left disappointed.According to Ryan Glasspiegel of Front Office Sports, YouTube approached Jason Kelce about appearing on its coverage of the highly anticipated Chargers-Chiefs matchup. The former Philadelphia Eagles center, now a rising media personality, seemed like a natural fit given his strong ties to the Chiefs through his brother, Travis Kelce . However, ESPN reportedly blocked the move.Kelce, who signed a multi-year contract with ESPN last year to serve as an analyst on Monday Night Football, is restricted by a new company policy. The network has decided that on-air talent will no longer be permitted to appear on coverage from competitors such as YouTube or Netflix.Interestingly, this is a shift from last season when ESPN allowed Mina Kimes and Laura Rutledge to take part in Netflix’s Christmas Day doubleheader studio show.But with streaming platforms increasingly entering the live sports space, ESPN appears to be tightening control over its personalities.It’s easy to see why YouTube pursued Jason Kelce. His “New Heights” podcast with brother Travis has exploded in popularity, drawing even bigger attention recently with Taylor Swift’s appearance. The pop icon’s relationship with Travis Kelce has amplified media buzz, making Jason a hot commodity for any NFL-related broadcast.Also Read: Tom Brady's son Jack ditches stepmom Gisele Bündchen for special outing with his birth mother Bridget Moynahan While Jason Kelce won’t be part of the opener, the Chiefs-Chargers clash still promises major storylines — from Justin Herbert leading the Chargers’ new-look offense to Patrick Mahomes beginning Kansas City’s title defense. But for fans of the Kelce brothers, it’s clear ESPN’s decision leaves a noticeable gap in YouTube’s coverage.",ESPN blocks Jason Kelce from making guest appearance on YouTube.

A table lined with espresso martinis, each glass raised in celebratory cheer.Brittany herself was spotted tossing her head back with a “Yee-Haw!” moment, silver boots glinting under the lights.The celebration also spotlighted Brittany’s growing friendship with Taylor Swift.

The two women quickly grew close, often seen cheering together from a private box at Arrowhead Stadium.Swift and Kelce, who recently announced their engagement, have Brittany’s full support. “Two of the most genuine people meet & fall in love,” Brittany wrote in a heartfelt Instagram story, pairing her words with Swift’s song So High School and the couple’s engagement photos.Though it’s unclear whether Swift joined the late-night festivities, her presence in Brittany’s circle made the birthday weekend even more special.

Projected shake-ups after a wild opening weekend

Ohio State

LSU

Penn State

Georgia

Notre Dame

Oregon

Miami

Arizona State

Illinois

South Carolina



Who’s rising, and who’s tumbling?

Big games, shocking losses, and a complete shake-up of power provided drama all over the map to start the 2025 college football season, and it will show in the Week 2 AP Top 25 poll. No. 3 Ohio State, the defending champion, went on the road and knocked off the preseason No. 1, Texas, and No. 4 Florida State, aided by a dominant effort over No. 21 Alabama, among the top wins of the weekend. Since there should be so much movement going on, now you have to wonder how the rankings shake out entering Week 2.Ohio State is going to be ranked as the No. 1 team, and deservedly so. Penn State, which steamrolled Nevada, might claim that role as Ohio State's nearest pursuer. They will likely join LSU, coming off a gutty road upset of Clemson, and Georgia, coming off a bludgeoning of its own, at or near the top of the poll. Meanwhile, Florida State put itself back on the national map with a demolition of Alabama, likely moving the Seminoles back to the Top 25 after opening at No. 30.Here is how one projection sees the Top 10 shaping up for Week 2:Also Read: YouTube TV strikes major deal with Fox, secures uninterrupted NFL and college football action for fans Multiple teams seem to have emerged as overall winners from the first week.Illinois crushes Western Illinois 52–3 and could reach the top 10 for the first time in decades. Beating Alabama put the wind at the Seminoles' backs to propel them right into the middle of the pack.Alabama losing to Florida State was one of the bigger losses of the weekend, but one of the bigger gains of the weekend, nonetheless, for the Crimson Tide. After being well-seated in the Top 10, the Crimson Tide now stares at falling well out of the Top 15, and maybe even the Top 25.The Longhorns may stay in the top 10 because of some combination of their talent and looming preseason rankings, but Texas entered the season as the No. 1 team in the country, and a home loss to the Buckeyes could also drop them off a cliff. But challenges still await Clemson, especially after losing to LSU.Tuesday, September 2, 2025, is he official day for the Week 2 AP Top 25 poll release. Updated rankings should be posted around 2 p.m. ET.

Patrick Mahomes jokes about Travis Kelce ’s travel knowledge despite Argentina visit

Chiefs eye redemption after Super Bowl disappointment

The Kansas City Chiefs are starting the 2025 NFL season in unusual fashion—far from Arrowhead Stadium and deep into South America. Patrick Mahomes and his teammates will face the Los Angeles Chargers in São Paulo on September 5, marking one of the NFL’s boldest international season openers.As the Chiefs prepare for their long journey, Mahomes used the moment to lighten the mood with a playful jab at his star tight end. Speaking to reporters about the travel logistics, the quarterback admitted some of his teammates underestimated the distance.“The trainers and coaches have really done the research and they understand what we need to do, so now it's just going down there and playing football,” Mahomes explained. “I think more than anything it's just explaining to some guys how far the trip was. Some guys didn't understand how far the travel was. Travis, even though he just was down there last year, I was explaining to him how the globe works.”The dry humor was classic Mahomes, and while it came at Kelce’s expense, the Chiefs’ tight end is unlikely to mind. After all, Kelce has been used to the spotlight—whether from football dominance or his high-profile engagement to Taylor Swift.Beyond the jokes, this matchup carries significant weight. The last time the world saw Kansas City in action, they were dismantled by the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl. A strong performance in Brazil would be the perfect way to reset the narrative and reassert themselves as the AFC’s team to beat.Also Read: NFL punishes Shilo Sanders with $4,669 fine after ugly incident and Buccaneers release For fans in Brazil, the game also represents history—a rare chance to see two divisional rivals battle it out on their home turf.

Micah Parsons consoles young Cowboys fan after emotional reaction



Micah Parsons embraces pressure with Packers’ record contract



When the Dallas Cowboys stunned the NFL world by trading Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, emotions ran high. Fans felt betrayed, pundits questioned Jerry Jones’ move, and a viral clip of a young supporter crying captured that heartbreak. Yet, what stood out was Parsons’ heartfelt response—FaceTiming the child, offering encouragement, and promising a Packers jersey with his iconic No. 1. In that moment, Parsons showed the human side of a blockbuster trade.The trade didn’t just impact analysts and fantasy football rosters—it hit fans on a deeply personal level. One viral TikTok video captured the raw emotion of a young Cowboys fan, filmed by his mother Lesley, breaking down in tears after learning Parsons had been dealt away. What followed turned into one of the most heartwarming moments of the offseason.Parsons himself saw the clip, reached out, and later FaceTimed the devastated child. His words were both empathetic and motivational: “I saw that video, I’m sorry, bruh. I hope you know, in life, things happen that you can’t control, but you just got to keep going.”The four-time Pro Bowler didn’t stop there. He promised the boy a brand-new Packers jersey with his No.1 on it. “Even though you’re a big Cowboys fan, I hope that you still follow me and my career, because that’s what it’s all about. Passionate fans. That just meant a lot to me. I hope you know that.” He even playfully reminded the youngster to focus on school, joking that bad grades might cost him the jersey.For the fan, it was a tough lesson in the business side of sports, but also a reminder that heroes can be human too.The Cowboys received a haul—two future first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark—in exchange for Parsons. Meanwhile, Green Bay wasted no time, signing him to a four-year, $188 million extension, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in league history.At his Green Bay introduction, Parsons admitted the reality of the deal hadn’t fully sunk in. “I didn’t think I would be traded,” he said. “But that’s the harsh reality.” Still, he embraced the pressure, noting: “I’d be a fool to not think that there isn’t expectations… But then again, that’s a blessing in itself, that means that they believe in me that much.”Parsons’ first test comes quickly: a month from now, he’ll return to Dallas in a Packers uniform, staring down the very fans who once cheered his every sack.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes teases Travis Kelce with geography joke ahead of Chiefs’ season opener in Brazil","Micah Parsons was traded by the Dallas Cowboys to the Green Bay Packers.

Josh Allen’s MVP season sets the stage for higher goals



IS THIS FINALLY THE YEAR JOSH ALLEN AND THE BILLS WIN THE SUPER BOWL?? | Broken Table

Josh Allen chasing Super Bowl glory in 2025



Josh Allen finally earned his first MVP award after a remarkable 2024 season, but the Buffalo Bills’ Super Bowl dream once again slipped away. A bitter AFC Championship loss to Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs left the quarterback hungry for more. Entering his eighth season, Allen knows the margin for error is gone—this is championship or bust for him and the Bills.The 29-year-old quarterback delivered one of the finest campaigns of his career, throwing for 3,731 yards, 28 touchdowns, and only six interceptions. On the ground, he added 531 rushing yards with 12 touchdowns, showcasing his trademark dual-threat ability. The performance not only earned him the league MVP but also secured a six-year, $330 million contract extension. Away from the field, Allen celebrated personal milestones too, marrying his longtime partner.Yet, despite all the accolades, the season felt incomplete without a Lombardi Trophy. For Allen, the next step is clear: turning personal achievements into team history. “Not letting the past impact us. If we keep putting our heads down and keep knocking at the door, the door is going to open eventually. The only thing I can think of is I get the chills just thinking about it.God’s timing is always right,” Allen told Albert Breer.Oddsmakers agree the Bills are primed for a breakthrough. With +600 odds, Buffalo enters the 2025 season as the Super Bowl favorite, edging out the Eagles and Chiefs. The only team sharing their odds is the Baltimore Ravens—who happen to be the Bills’ first opponent on September 8.Allen understands that past heartbreaks cannot define this team. After four straight Super Bowl appearances from 1990 to 1993 without a win, Buffalo has waited more than two decades for another shot at glory. This season, Allen is determined to deliver. With his MVP-caliber talent, renewed leadership, and unwavering belief, he’s preparing to lead the Bills where they’ve longed to go: Santa Clara in February 2026, with the Lombardi Trophy finally in hand.Also Read: “Hottest female”: Ciara's ex-boyfriend calls her his hottest ex contrasting his past with her life now with NFL star Russell Wilson","Josh Allen claims Bills will crush Chiefs, Eagles and Ravens to finally win long-awaited Super Bowl.

Why Swifties saw the repost as crossing a personal boundary

A history of oversharing from the Kelce family



Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s engagement was supposed to be a fairytale celebration, but a surprising move by Travis’ mother, Donna Kelce, has stirred controversy. Swifties are expressing outrage after Donna reposted a comedy reel that joked about Taylor’s “uterus aching” to “breed” a Kelce baby—a post that many fans labeled invasive and “weird AF. ”The reel originally came from comedian Leanne Morgan, who joked on stage: “Her uterus is aching, and she wants a baby. She wants a baby, and it’s time. It’s time for her to want a baby and she wants to breed with that big old Kelsey boy.” While the bit may have been intended as humor, Donna’s decision to share it amplified the message in a way that Swift’s loyal fanbase didn’t appreciate.Many argued that Taylor, fresh off a major engagement, should not have to endure pressure about starting a family. Swifties flooded social media, describing Donna’s repost as not only inappropriate but also reflective of the “stereotypical MIL” trope—placing expectations on a woman’s personal choices instead of simply celebrating her joy.This isn’t the first time a Kelce parent has drawn attention for saying too much. Travis’ father, Ed Kelce, previously raised eyebrows when he shared behind-the-scenes details of the engagement, including that Taylor had grown “antsy” about the timing.While some fans found it sweet, others felt it was far too personal for public consumption.Also Read: “Hottest female”: Ciara's ex-boyfriend calls her his hottest ex contrasting his past with her life now with NFL star Russell Wilson Still, Donna has also shown genuine affection toward Taylor, even changing her Facebook cover photo to a collage of baby Travis and baby Taylor after the engagement.

Who Is Piotr Szczerek ?



What happened at the 2025 US Open?



Massive social media backlash



'Yes, I took it' : Polish CEO's reported response







Millionaire CEO Piotr Szczerek was unmasked on social media after his video of snatching a hat from a child at US Open went viral. The hat was special as it was signed by tennis star Kamil Majchrzak's and the CEO had no reason to snatch it from the child other than the pure intent of bullying a child. His enthusiasm for the hat signed by Kamil that left a child heartbroken backfired as social media users hunted down the CEO, his business and his family and vowed that he will have to pay a bitter price for what he did on camera.Piotr Szczerek is a Polish entrepreneur and the CEO of a paving and landscaping company called Drogbruk, which he co-founded with his wife Anna in 1999.During a live broadcast at the 2025 US Open, Polish tennis star Kamil Majchrzak tried to hand his signed cap to a young fan, but Piotr Szczerek grabbed it first and tucked it into his wife’s bag—snatching it away from the disappointed boy. The moment instantly went viral and sparked widespread outrage. Online sleuths identified Szczerek as the man in the clip, and backlash followed rapidly. Following the incident, Szczerek deactivated his social media accounts amid the public fury. Critics even debated his actions online, calling him “selfish” and demanding accountability. In the wake of the controversy, Polish fans and users on platforms like Gowork.pl flooded Drogbruk’s online space with harsh criticism and negative reviews.Kamil Majchrzak responded to the row and tracked down the child, Brok, and gifted him a new signed cap and other memorabilia.Social media users said Szczerek's company will now pay a massive price for what he did. ""Nothing is more disgusting than a child bully. He is Piotr Szczerek, the owner of the Polish Drogbruk company, stealing the cap of Kamil Majchrzak during the US open. Disgusting people,"" one wrote.""The internet didn’t just find him. They found his company. And they’re lighting up every review site they can find. This is what happens when the world sees you rob a kid’s moment, and you smile like you got away with it,"" another wrote.If the action did not bring Piotr Czczerek enough shame, his apparent justification did as he reportedly said that there was nothing wrong in taking the cap. He said he was quick and so he took the cap as life is first-come first first-served.""The recent incident at the tennis match has caused a disproportionate online uproar.

Oleksandr Usyk video sparks action from WBO officials

“A career after boxing beckons, for undisputed champ Oleksandr Usyk.”

“detailed and thorough”

“The committee cannot allow further delay or uncertainty without satisfactory clarification,”

Joseph Parker and Fabio Wardley waiting as Oleksandr Usyk’s future remains unclear

Following a video that showed Oleksandr Usyk dancing on stage in Ukraine, the world heavyweight champion has been asked to provide a new medical report. The video, shot earlier this week at a public event, showed the 38-year-old spinning, hopping, and waving his arms next to Ukrainian pop singer Nadia Dorofeeva. The video caused alarm since Usyk had only asked for additional time to heal from a back injury before defending his title against Joseph Parker.The World Boxing Organization (WBO) reacted quickly after the video was widely shared online by streaming platform DAZN with the caption:In response, WBO Championship Committee chairman Luis Batista Salas sent a letter to Usyk’s team demandingclarification of the boxer’s health.Salas wrote, adding that the new report must include the fighter’s present condition, recovery timeline, and medical evidence. The WBO has given Oleksandr Usyk until Monday to comply, warning that failure could lead to disciplinary action under its rules.The situation comes after Usyk had already asked the WBO in early August for a 90-day suspension of negotiations for his mandatory fight against Joseph Parker.At that time, his camp submitted medical papers recommending complete rest and physiotherapy. The WBO accepted the request, but the latest video has cast doubt over those claims.Also Read: Tony Ferguson Beats Salt Papi By Third-Round TKO In Thrilling Debut At Misfits Boxing 22 Ending His 8 Fight Skid Oleksandr Usyk, who holds a perfect record of 24 wins and no defeats with 15 knockouts, was instructed on July 29 to start talks with New Zealand’s Parker, the former WBO champion who now has 36 wins and 3 losses.Instead, Oleksandr Usyk told officials he was treating back issues that came after a grueling run of three world title fights in just over a year, including his famous 2024 rematch with Tyson Fury.Now, with Oleksandr Usyk’s fitness in question, Parker is exploring other options. Reports in Britain suggest that undefeated heavyweight Fabio Wardley (19-0-1) is the frontrunner to fight Parker later this year if the Usyk bout does not go ahead.The WBO’s demand has turned what looked like a simple medical delay into a bigger issue. The clip of Oleksandr Usyk dancing in Ukraine may have been light-hearted, but it has forced boxing’s top officials to insist on clear proof of his condition before any championship decisions are made.Oleksandr Usyk’s lively stage moment has now created pressure, fueling debates among fans, media, and rivals, while leaving the boxing world eagerly waiting to see if his championship plans truly remain intact.","Oleksandr Usyk asked to provide new medical report following viral dance video.

NHL Trade Rumors: Canadiens eye September 1 deadline to finalize Carey Price contract move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-canadiens-eye-september-1-deadline-to-finalize-carey-price-contract-move/articleshow/123614956.cms,"Carey Price (Getty Images)

Why the Canadiens are motivated to move Carey Price’s contract before the season

Carey Price’s legacy and what this move means for Montreal’s rebuild

The Montreal Canadiens could finally be closing the book on Carey Price’s contract, and the latest insider chatter suggests a move might come as soon as Sept. 1. According to TVA Sports’ Jean-Charles Lajoie, general manager Kent Hughes is exploring a deal that would send Price’s $84 million contract to a Western Conference team — with draft picks potentially being included to sweeten the return.The Canadiens are currently more than $5.9 million over the salary cap, and with Price’s contract still on the books despite him being on long-term injured reserve, Hughes is under pressure to find cap relief. Trading Price’s deal not only clears financial space but also positions Montreal to be more flexible at the trade deadline.Lajoie explained the situation on social media, writing: “#CH fans, be on the lookout. The costly September 1st will see C Price's contract move elsewhere. K Hughes is reportedly willing to trade picks, especially in the first round, to add a natural center to his roster. A complex but effective deal, just like the GM likes, is in the making. The Western Conference is one to watch... And it's all very exciting! 25-26 will be a fascinating season!!”Price, a former Vezina and Hart Trophy winner, last played on April 29, 2022, before a severe knee injury ended his career in all but name. Though he hasn’t formally retired, he has remained on LTIR while the Canadiens continue their rebuild.The timing of this potential move is key. On Sept. 1, the Canadiens owe Price a $5.5 million signing bonus, leaving just $2 million in actual salary for the acquiring team. For a franchise looking to hit the salary-cap floor, his $10.5 million cap hit is valuable without being a major financial burden.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Oilers may target All-Star goalie Michael DiPietro after back-to-back Cup Final losses By moving Price’s contract, the Canadiens can gain critical roster flexibility and possibly add a much-needed natural center, a move that could help stabilize their lineup in the long run.",The Montreal Canadiens could be closing the book on Carey Price's contract.

A painful night that tested Colorado’s spirit

Coach Prime’s calm words steady shaken emotions

Shedeur’s private rallying cry to his father

Regrouping together to answer the season’s challenge

The Colorado Buffaloes’ opening night against Georgia Tech ended in a narrow 27–20 defeat, but the loss carried a weight that went far beyond the scoreboard. In the aftermath, it wasn’t just Coach Prime’s words at the podium that mattered. It was a seven-word family message from his son, Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders, that underscored the family’s bond and demand for accountability.Colorado’s defense forced three first-quarter turnovers but failed to convert them into momentum. The Buffaloes finished with just one offensive touchdown, while Georgia Tech’s Haynes King gashed them for 156 rushing yards. In total, Colorado gave up 320 rushing yards—numbers that highlight a recurring weakness from last season. The result left fans and analysts questioning whether the Buffaloes can rise above the same flaws that haunted them in 2024.Deion Sanders took the setback in stride, choosing to focus on positives rather than panic. “I’m optimistic on everything. We’re definitely gonna be fine. We could’ve won that game. It’s not like we got our butts kicked,” he said afterward. His tone echoed the resilience he has preached since Colorado’s rebuild began, but behind closed doors, his son delivered a sterner call.Now an NFL rookie in Cleveland, Shedeur has transitioned from son to leader. Hours after the game, he typed a pointed reminder in the family’s group chat: “As SANDERS MEN we have to regroup.” The message symbolized a deeper expectation—that the Sanders legacy is measured not by setbacks, but by how swiftly they respond to them.For the Sanders family, football is a proving ground of character. Shilo continues to fight for his NFL shot, while Shedeur grows into his professional role. Next up for Colorado is Nebraska, a chance to turn frustration into fuel. Whether that private message becomes a turning point will depend on how the Buffaloes answer their own quarterback’s rallying cry.Also read: Chicago Bears fifth-round rookie Zah Frazier will sit out 2025 season after personal issue emerges","The Colorado Buffaloes lost 27–20 to Georgia Tech in their opening game of the season.

With her already being spotted during Sanders’ health battle and their closeness in those hospital clips, fans didn’t need much more to put two and two together. Even without Sanders openly confirming, the internet seems pretty convinced that Karrueche’s mystery man is Prime Time himself.As soon as her comments spread online, social media lit up with reactions, some playful, some shady, and some downright brutal. Two themes quickly emerged, fans believe Karrueche has a “celebrity-only” dating pattern, and many just can’t get over the major age gap between her and Sanders.One user summed it up perfectly, tweeting:That line captured what a lot of people were thinking, that Karrueche seems to always be linked to well-known men, whether it was in Hollywood, music, or now the NFL world.Then came the age-gap commentary, with one fan writing:That reaction struck a chord, because it wasn’t just a one-off variation of the same comment flooded timelines. For some, the romance feels sweet and supportive. For others, the fact that Deion is 57 while Karrueche is 36 is a little too much to overlook.Of course, it wouldn’t be Twitter without a few stray jabs. One fan roasted Sanders’ look, writing,While another joked:referencing Sanders’ well-documented health issues.Still, not everyone was trolling. Some fans cheered the couple on, dropping comments likeandreminding everyone that plenty of people actually support the unexpected pairing.Between the trolling about her dating history, the jokes about Sanders’ age, and the memes about his appearance, this new romance has already become a pop culture spectacle. But for every critic, there’s a fan hyping them up. Until Deion himself confirms or denies the rumors, the internet is going to keep roasting, speculating, and posting memes at lightning speed.Also read - “Trapped you with a baby”: Fans react to Travis Hunter becoming a dad before rookie debut","Karrueche Tran finally confirms she’s dating.

PM Modi’s letter to Pujara:

Dear Cheteshwar,

I learnt about your decision to retire from all forms of cricket. Following the announcement, there has been an outpouring of appreciation from the fans and the cricketing fraternity about your remarkable achievements. I convey my heartiest congratulations and warmest greetings on a spectacular cricketing career.

In an age dominated by shorter formats of cricket, you were a reminder of the beauty of the longer format of the game. Your unflappable temperament and ability to bat long hours with great concentration made you the fulcrum of the Indian batting line-up.

Your outstanding cricketing career is dotted with moments of remarkable skill and resolve, especially in challenging conditions overseas. For example, fans will always remember instances like the tests in Australia, when you laid the foundation for India’s historic first-ever series win on Australian soil! Standing tall against one of the most potent bowling attacks, you showed what it meant to shoulder responsibility for the team.

There have been many series victories, centuries, double centuries and accolades in your career. But no numbers can capture the sense of calm that your presence gave to fans and teammates, that the team’s fate was in safe hands. This is truly your abiding legacy that goes beyond mere numbers.

Your passion for the game was also reflected in the fact that even while being an international cricketer, you made it a point to play first-class cricket, whether it was for Saurashtra, or abroad. Your long association with Saurashtra cricket and your contribution to putting Rajkot on the cricketing map will remain a source of immense pride for every youngster in the region.

I am sure that your father, a cricketer himself as well as your mentor, is proud of you. Puja and Aditi must be delighted to be able to spend more time with you. They have all made great sacrifices to support you along the way.

Beyond the field, your in-depth analysis as a commentator continues to add great value to cricket enthusiasts, who look forward to hearing your insights. I am confident that you will keep yourself associated with the game and inspire budding cricketers.

Best wishes for your journey ahead.

NEW DELHI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has reportedly reached out to former India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni with an offer to join the national team as a mentor ahead of next year’s ICC T20 World Cup. While the news has generated excitement among fans, former cricketer and West Bengal legislator Manoj Tiwary responded with a tongue-in-cheek remark about Dhoni’s well-known reclusive nature.Speaking to ANI, Tiwary joked about how difficult it can be to get in touch with the former India skipper.“Woh phone uthaye hain na? Jahaan tak mujhe pataa hain phone pe milna bohot mushkil hai woh! Message ka reply bhi milta bohot kam hai. Bohot players apne samay main kahaa bhi hai. Pataa nahi woh reply kya karenge… woh message padhenge ki nahi padhenge (Did he pick up the phone? Because it is difficult to reach him on the phone. Replies to messages from him are also very rare, many players have said this. Will he read the message or not, we don’t know),” Tiwary remarked with a smile.The former Bengal captain further said that the key question is whether Dhoni will accept the role in the first place.“The first thing is whether he will accept the role or not. It’s very difficult for me to predict what impact he will have. His experience as a captain and as a player will be very useful, as the new players emerging today and becoming stars of the Indian team give him a lot of respect. The pairing of MS Dhoni and Gautam Gambhir will also be worth watching,” he added.Dhoni, 43, called time on his international career in 2020 but continues to be a mainstay in the Indian Premier League as captain of Chennai Super Kings (CSK). Under his leadership, the franchise has lifted five IPL titles, the most recent coming in 2023, reaffirming his stature as one of the game’s most successful leaders.Across his international journey, Dhoni steered India to three major ICC trophies — the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 in 2007, the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011, and the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013.","The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has reportedly reached out to former India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni with an offer to join the national team as a mentor.

Dana White’s quiet gesture viewed as different from Dwayne Johnson and MrBeast

“Charity done in discreet feels so much more genuine than charity done when it’s in front of five camera angles like The Rock and Mr Beast.”

“Dana White paid for Ben Askren’s transplant and let Jake and the rest of the internet clown him for not doing so, ‘cause Dana didn’t want to publicize it.”

Dana White, UFC President, quietly became a hero when he donated $50,000 in 2010 to save a little girl in Thailand. He saw a social media post from Ben Pittsley, who had just trained under coach RattanachaiJadnooleum. The coach’s baby daughter, Tuptim Jadnooleum, needed urgent liver surgery and would die within days without help. Dana checked if it was real. When he found out it was, he sent the money right away and saved her life. This private act has made many fans say his kindness feels more genuine than flashy charity.Dana White first heard about the girl’s crisis from Ben Pittsley on a weekend, just letting the day roll by when he came across the post online. The coach’s daughter needed $50,000 fast, or she wouldn’t make it. Dana felt the message spoke his language, pulled the trigger, and donated.He later visited Thailand in 2018 and saw how much the family valued his help. At the gym, there’s a big photo of Dana over Tuptim’s bed, like she sees him as her guardian angel.He still pays for her schooling and medical care today. Dana says he doesn’t like talking about it because he didn’t do it for praise; he just felt he had to help.Recently, social media fans compared Dana White’s quiet help to large charity acts by Dwayne Johnson and Mr.Beast, stars known for big, camera-ready giving.One fan wrote,Another fan pointed out that Dana also helped Ben Askren, the former UFC fighter, when Askren needed a double-lung transplant in 2025, but again, Dana didn’t make a big show of it:These comments show that many people value quiet kindness more than loud generosity, even when the amount is just as big.","Dana White, UFC President, quietly became a hero when he donated $50,000 in 2010 to save a little girl in Thailand.

DeWayne Carter injury and roster impact

What changes for Buffalo’s defensive line in week 1 and beyond

The Buffalo Bills lost second-year defensive tackle DeWayne Carter for the season. On Aug. 31, 2025, Jordan Schultz of FOX Sports reported that Carter tore his Achilles and will miss 2025. Carter later confirmed the news on social media. The injury occurred during Wednesday’s practice on Aug. 27, per ESPN’s Alaina Getzenberg.Schultz reported the torn Achilles and season-ending timeline on Aug. 31. “Sources: #Bills DT DeWayne Carter tore his Achilles and will miss the entire 2025 season.” Credit: Jordan Schultz, FOX Sports. Getzenberg confirmed the injury and date of occurrence. “Bills second-year defensive tackle DeWayne Carter tore his Achilles and has been ruled out for the season… Injury took place during Wednesday’s practice. ” Credit: Alaina Getzenberg, ESPN.Carter addressed the setback on X the same day. “This is all a part of my testimony. I will be back. John 13:7.” Credit: DeWayne Carter.Carter made the Bills’ final group of defensive tackles with Ed Oliver, DaQuan Jones, and rookies Deone Walker and TJ Sanders. He was positioned for an expanded rotational role behind Oliver and Jones. The Bills also carry veteran Jordan Phillips on the practice squad.With Carter headed to injured reserve, Phillips is a logical elevation candidate. Syracuse.com’s Ryan Talbot noted Buffalo added two defensive tackles to the practice squad, including Phillips. Lance Lysowski of the Buffalo News previously framed Phillips as insurance while Carter competed for depth snaps and while free agent addition Larry Ogunjobi serves a six-game suspension for violating the NFL’s performance-enhancing substances policy.Buffalo opens against the Baltimore Ravens in Week 1. The top four now center on Oliver and Jones as starters, with first-year players Sanders and Walker in reserve. The Bills historically rotate heavily up front. That approach can continue if Sanders and Walker handle early-down work and situational snaps. Phillips offers veteran stability if promoted. He has 129 career games, 62 starts, and 24.0 sacks. His body type and experience give the staff a plug-and-play interior option while Ogunjobi is unavailable.Carter’s college profile and rookie usage suggest why Buffalo valued his 2025 role. At Duke, he earned All-ACC recognition in multiple seasons and produced disruptive plays across sacks, tackles for loss, forced fumbles, pass breakups, and a fumble return touchdown. As a rookie, he appeared in 11 games with three starts and logged five tackles for loss, three quarterback hits, and one pass defensed. The injury pauses that trajectory until 2026.Buffalo can survive the short-term loss because the starters remain intact and the rotation has viable pieces. The cleanest path is a Phillips elevation and expanded chances for Sanders and Walker. The longer view is Carter’s rehab and a Year 3 return if recovery stays on schedule.","The Buffalo Bills lost second-year defensive tackle DeWayne Carter for the season.

Caitlin Clark meets George Kittle during Indiana Fever’s matchup with Golden State Valkyries



The Golden State Valkyries dominated the Indiana Fever at Chase Center



Caitlin Clark found a different spotlight Sunday night at Chase Center when she crossed the court to greet familiar faces. The Indiana Fever guard, sidelined once again with injury, shared a courtside reunion with San Francisco 49ers stars George Kittle and Kyle Juszczyk and their families during the Fever’s matchup against the Golden State Valkyries. For a night marred by delays and frustrations, her presence still drew attention beyond the game itself.Before the opening tip, Caitlin Clark made her way across the floor to say hello to tight end George Kittle and his wife, Claire, both Iowa alums like herself. Claire, who once suited up for the Hawkeyes women’s basketball team, embraced Clark in a warm exchange that highlighted their shared roots. The moment also included 49ers fullback Kyle Juszczyk and his wife, Kristin, who have become regular supporters of women’s basketball on the Bay Area stage.The reunion happened while Clark continued to manage her recovery from a strained groin and ankle bruise. The 23-year-old has appeared in only 13 of Indiana’s 40 contests this season, yet she remains central to the franchise’s hopes. Her averages of 16.5 points, 8.8 assists, five rebounds, and 1.6 steals underscore her value, though her absence has left the Fever shorthanded in a season already defined by injuries.Indiana’s struggles were clear once more on Sunday. The Fever fell 75-63, undone by Golden State’s blistering first-half shooting and the frustration of repeated stoppages inside the arena.What should have been a straightforward night of basketball turned into a marathon. Malfunctioning shot clocks forced multiple stoppages, including a 25-minute break in the first quarter. Officials leaned heavily on video reviews, grinding the pace even further. By halftime, nearly 92 minutes had elapsed, transforming Chase Center into something closer to a nightclub than an arena.Music filled the lulls as fans danced to Bay Area classics, but both teams bristled at the constant interruptions. Still, the Valkyries capitalized once play resumed. Iliana Rupert hit a career-high 21 points on five three-pointers, while rookie Janelle Salaün chipped in 10 points and steady defense. Veronica Burton orchestrated the offense with 13 assists, helping Golden State extend its winning streak to three.Also Read: “We getting that b***h this year” – Draymond Green spilled beans on Golden State Warriors' ultimate target in 2025-26 season For the Fever, Kelsey Mitchell poured in 14 points, but All-Star forward Aliyah Boston was limited to just four.

Hockey India president Dilip Tirkey confirmed on Sunday that Team Gonasika, which competed in the Hockey India League last season and finished seventh, has pulled out of the tournament and will be replaced by a new team.Odisha Warriors, winners of the first edition of the Women’s HIL, will also not take part in the next edition and will be replaced by a new franchise.“We will have a mini auction, and the new teams will be able to choose their players during that time. Also, the remaining teams will release some players, and some of them will be retained, but we haven’t decided on the nitty-gritties yet,” said the former India hockey captain. He added that discussions are ongoing about whether two more teams can be added to the women’s tournament, which currently has four teams.Meanwhile, the tournament will be held in a third city in addition to Ranchi and either Bhubaneswar or Rourkela. However, it will not take place anywhere in north India.“Chandigarh and Mohali’s names came up during the discussions, and we wanted to hold HIL matches in north India.But we analysed that there is heavy fog during the winters, which could delay flights and make it difficult to hold matches on time,” said Tirkey.Tirkey also confirmed that players who hadn’t been paid by Odisha Warriors after the tournament were compensated in full from Hockey India’s prize money fund. He added that hopefully, there won’t be any such delays when the tournament is held again next year.Regarding the India men’s team, who are currently competing in the Asia Cup after losing seven successive games in the Pro League, Tirkey sounded quite relaxed.“We have not put any pressure on the coach for the past performances. He has won us a bronze medal at the Olympics and a gold at the Asian Games. So, we are confident that he will be able to take the team to a world level in a year,” said Tirkey.However, the situation was different when he spoke about the women’s team, which will begin their campaign in the Women’s Asia Cup this week in Hangzhou, China.“The women’s team coach, the support staff, and the players need to focus on working harder. It’s true that senior players have been struggling with injuries, and we don’t have as many experienced replacements, but we can only hope that they will perform well,” he added.","Team Gonasika will be replaced by a new team. Odisha Warriors, winners of the first edition of the Women’s HIL, will also not take part in the next edition. The tournament will be held in a third city in addition to Ranchi and either Bhubaneswar or Rourkela. It will not take place anywhere in north India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123625892,imgsize-1394764,width-400,resizemode-4/dilip-tirkey.jpg"

It was once again choc-a-bloc at the Rajgir Sports Complex as fans poured in, hoping to see the Indian team dominate Japan in their second match of the Asia Cup here on Sunday.But that wasn’t the case, as the hosts just managed a narrow 3-2 win, thanks to some solid goalkeeping by Suraj Karkera and brilliant running by Vivek Sagar Prasad during the penalty corners, following some high-press play, to book their spot in the Super4s stage.As for the goals, Mandeep Singh opened the scoring in the fourth minute with a field goal following a pass from Sukhjeet Singh, and Harmanpreet Singh doubled the lead in the next minute after India won a series of penalty corners.The captain struck again in the dying seconds of the third quarter, scoring his second of the match through the legs of the goalkeeper, after Kosei Kawabe had pulled one back for Japan in the 38th minute.Kawabe was on target once more with a minute left on the clock as Karkera’s defence was eventually breached after the ball deflected off the framework. Sensing a chance to equalise, Japan kept applying pressure, but India managed to hold on, even as Harmanpreet received a yellow card.Karkera, however, was brilliant—especially when Japan won four back-to-back penalty corners in the second quarter and then three successive corners in the final quarter. During one of those, he first stopped the ball with his left foot and then dived to block the deflected shot that came off the rebound.Even Krishan Bahadur Pathak, playing his 150th match, made around five saves, but it was Karkera who stole the show.Asked what was going through his mind when Japan kept winning successive penalty corners, the Indian custodian said, “We had planned a way to defend the PCs, and we executed it. Of course, there is a lot of space for improvement. But we watched the videos of the match against China and worked on wherever we did wrong.”While Karkera has worked a lot on his reflexes, facing up to 500 shots in training sessions, he specifically focused on counter control ahead of the tournament, which was evident in the way he managed the team as Japan countered in the late stages of the game.Coach Craig Fulton was also happy with Karkera and Vivek’s performances but rued the absence of field goals despite the team creating multiple chances.“We high-pressed really well, and that part of our game was excellent. We couldn’t convert a few more field goals, but the stats are really high for us in that aspect. We just couldn’t finish what we started,” said Fulton.However, playing such a high-pressing game early on, combined with the heat, left the team low on energy in the third quarter.“These games at 3 o’clock and 1 o’clock are super difficult. No one really realised it. You don’t play in 35-degree heat with this humidity normally unless you come from Malaysia or somewhere hot all the time,” added the coach.It was during this period that Japan pulled one back and pressed hard in the final quarter, but India eventually held on for the win.Earlier in the day, China scored 13 goals against Kazakhstan after conceding in the second minute through a penalty corner. After that early hiccup, China dominated and will be hoping to carry that momentum against Japan on Monday. India, meanwhile, will face Kazakhstan next.","Mandeep Singh opened the scoring in the fourth minute with a field goal following a pass from Sukhjeet Singh.

From hooch den to football haven: MP's ‘Mini Brazil’ scores big; village kids eye Bundesliga dream,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/from-hooch-den-to-football-haven-mps-mini-brazil-scores-big-village-kids-eye-bundesliga-dream/articleshow/123625701.cms,"Bicharpur, Madhya Pradesh, earned recognition as 'Mini Brazil' for its football culture. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced German coach Dietmar Beiersdorfer's offer to train players from the village in Germany.

Modi hails MP athletes for 'Khelo India' success





BHOPAL: Bicharpur, a village in MP that wears the epithet ""Mini Brazil"" for producing dozens of footballers over the years, scored a decisive goal on Sunday when PM Narendra Modi announced in his Mann Ki Baat broadcast that German coach Dietmar Beiersdorfer had offered to train select boys and girls from the hamlet in an academy in Germany.Beiersdorfer's interest in Bicharpur was stoked by PM Modi referring to its unique footballing culture during his lengthy chat with American podcaster Lex Fridman six months ago.The coaching idea gained momentum after the MP govt contacted the German, who used to play as a defender for Bundesliga clubs Hamburger SV and Werder Bremen before becoming a sporting director and manager.For Bicharpur, notorious in the 60s as a hooch den, the turnaround came under a footballer-turned-coach who inspired young people of the village to take up the game so that they would stay away from the liquor business.Bicharpur will now send four players, two of them girls, and their coach to Germany for a training stint at Beiersdorfer's club FC Ingolstadt 04 from Oct 4 to 12.""I am happy to see that the popularity of football is increasing in India. I urge football lovers to visit Bicharpur whenever they get time and closely witness the sporting revolution happening there,"" Modi said of the MP village.The PM first spoke of ""Mini Brazil"" in his July 2023 Mann Ki Baat, soon after visiting Shahdol.Bicharpur is home to about 1,000 footballers from the Baiga and Gond communities. Nearly every household in the village boasts a player or a coach.Some of these players have already progressed to the national level, with Roshni Singh, Sanya Kunde, Suhani Kol and Sapna Gupta among the more famous names.MP sports minister Vishwas Sarang said the state govt would do everything possible to ensure that the players selected to train in Germany have a beneficial, hitch-free trip.While coach Suresh Kunde is credited with initiating the village's young into the joy of playing the beautiful game, recognition came in 2002 when NIS coach Raees Ahmed took over.Ahmed, who is from a neighbouring village, began identifying talent early to hone their technique. Shahdol's then collector, Raghvendra Singh, gave Bicharpur the now-famous ""Mini Brazil"" tag in 2003. Modi also lauded the performance of MP athletes in the Khelo India Water Sports. He congratulated the state for securing the highest number of medals and winning the overall championship trophy. MP dominated the evenr, topping the medal tally with 18 medals, including 10 golds.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced German coach Dietmar Beiersdorfer's offer to train players from the village in Germany.

Poll Did Messi's miss cost Inter Miami the Leagues Cup? Yes No, it was a team loss

The Seattle Sounders delivered a commanding performance to defeat Lionel Messi ’s Inter Miami 3-0 in the Leagues Cup final on Sunday, completing their sweep of major North American trophies before a record crowd at Lumen Field.Osaze De Rosario opened the scoring in the 26th minute with a header from an Alex Roldan cross, sending the 69,314 fans into pandemonium. Roldan himself converted a penalty late in the second half, before Paul Rothrock sealed the victory in the 89th minute to spark celebrations.Seattle’s disciplined back line frustrated Miami’s star-studded attack throughout the contest. Messi saw an early header denied by Jackson Ragen, while another effort sailed over the bar after Luis Suárez created space for him early in the second half. The miss from close range shocked many given the fact that the Argentine is one of the deadliest finishers in the game from near. Miami’s best chance came in the 60th minute when Tadeo Allende missed wide from close range.Despite Miami’s pressure, the Sounders held firm. Ragen, Vargas and García combined to block repeated attempts, while goalkeeper Oscar Ustari was called into action on several occasions to deny further damage.The game reached a flashpoint when Yannik Bright’s challenge on substitute Georgi Minoungou earned Seattle a penalty in the 84th minute. Roldan calmly converted to double the advantage. Moments later, Rothrock’s angled finish completed the upset.The result extended Seattle’s trophy cabinet to include every major title available to an MLS club: two MLS Cups, a Supporters’ Shield, four US Open Cups, a CONCACAF Champions Cup and now the Leagues Cup. Their triumph came despite Miami boasting nearly triple the player wage bill, with the Sounders’ $16.7 million payroll dwarfed by Miami’s $46.8m.It was also a night of records in the stands, as the attendance figure set a new high for a Leagues Cup match and a new mark for any Sounders fixture at Lumen Field.The victory not only secured Seattle the Leagues Cup but also guaranteed direct entry into the round of 16 of the 2026 CONCACAF Champions Cup. Both finalists had already earned qualification for that competition, which will serve as the pathway to the 2029 FIFA Club World Cup.More surprisingly, it was the timing of Inter Miami's final defeat, which came just a week following Cristiano Ronaldo and Al-Nassr's loss on penalties to Al-Ahli in the Saudi Super Cup final.","Seattle Sounders beat Inter Miami 3-0 in the Leagues Cup final on Sunday.

WWE fans called out Becky Lynch's oversell of Nikki Bella’s move at Clash in Paris



Becky Lynch defeats Nikki Bella in Paris to retain the WWE Intercontinental Title



Overselling has been an issue in professional wrestling. Recently, at Clash in Paris, Becky Lynch went on to defend her Women’s Intercontinental Championship against Nikki Bella . However, the match, for the most part, received strong criticism from WWE fans online, especially after a clip of the rivals' fight went viral on social media. In the clip, Bella slammed Lynch’s head on the announce tables, but it looked so fake that fans could not hold their frustration.Becky Lynch’s match against Nikki Bella wasn’t necessarily bad, but the camera captured the duo’s loose attempt to sell the slam on the announce was terrible, as declared by many fans. Becky’s head barely touches the table as she holds her hand for softer slams. Of course, not uncommon in the wrestling scenario, but it comes down to how a talent can make a fight real without hurting themselves in the process. Both Lynch and Bella, in this regard, failed at the Clash in Paris.Fans were quick to share their thoughts online, revealing their frustration with the low effort and perhaps minimal training for the matchup.“I s*it looked so slow and fake,” Tito SanTanChez wrote on X.“Not a great sell job 🤣” joey shared.VISIONARY called it a move similar to “playing the bongos.”“When they pull crap like thus they have to get punished.It’s like there is no coaching,” The Bronx Pulse wrote.I'mDaRealestBird™ shared, “It's not just Becky. Wrestling from what I've seen (in WWE) as a whole has been softened up a bit in quite a few areas for safety purposes and what not. Bron's spears been toned down heavily, the way people get thrown over the ropes sometimes (Solo) etc. Takes some immersion away.”“Some fans in attendance paid over 5000$ a ticket for this kind of match quality lol. I understand that not every show is going to be Wrestlemania quality. But when the company inflates tickets prices, it's fine but my expectations go up, when it comes to presentation/match card,” Brian B shared.Becky Lynch walked out of Paris still the WWE Intercontinental Champion after surviving a grueling first-time singles clash with Nikki Bella. The match had the crowd on edge from the opening bell, with Nikki coming out aggressively and Lynch weathering the storm to ultimately secure the win. What looked like a potential upset quickly turned into a showcase of resilience from the reigning champion.From the outset, Nikki wasted no time asserting herself. She sent Lynch crashing to the outside, slamming her into barricades and the ring steps. But the champion quickly responded with her signature physicality, throwing Nikki into the post before connecting with a Bexploder and a vicious slap.Nikki nearly sealed the victory with an electric chair drop and a Bella Buster on the steel steps, but Lynch refused to stay down. The finish arrived after a dramatic stretch of reversals. Nikki had Lynch on her shoulders, teased a match-ending slam, and even locked in the Fearless Lock, but Lynch found a way out each time. As Bella looked to close, Lynch shifted her weight and rolled her into a perfectly timed backslide.Also Read: WWE Clash in Paris results: Roman Reigns taken out on a stretcher after huge victory over Bronson Reed One… two… three.

Scottish brothers back on shore after completing record 139-day row across Pacific,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/scottish-brothers-back-on-shore-after-completing-record-139-day-row-across-pacific/articleshow/123624310.cms,"



CAIRNS: Three Scottish brothers stepped ashore in Australia on Saturday after claiming a new record for rowing non-stop and unsupported across the Pacific Ocean, ""over the moon"" to be back on dry land.Ewan, Jamie and Lachlan MacLean set off in a carbon fibre dinghy from Lima in Peru in April for the 14,500 kilometres journey, enduring violent storms and sickness during their 139 days at sea.At one point Ewan was swept overboard before being pulled back into the boat, while they battled exhaustion and feared running out of food. ""The fastest human-powered crossing of the full Pacific Ocean, non-stop and unsupported,"" they said on social media after arriving in Cairns. ""After 139 days at sea, we are over the moon to be back on land with our friends and family,"" they added.The brothers, from Edinburgh, were given a bagpipe welcome in front of family and friends after the treacherous ordeal, which garnered support from celebrities including Mark Wahlberg and Ewan McGregor. ""Things got tough towards the end and we seriously thought we might run out of food,"" said middle brother Jamie.""Despite how exhausted we were, we had to step up a gear and make it before supplies ran out, but now we get to eat proper food. ""While the mid-Pacific - from California to Hawaii - is well travelled, relatively few have attempted the full Pacific from South America to Australia. Lithuanian solo rower Aurimas Mockus had to abandon his crossing attempt this year due to Tropical Cyclone Alfred. ""This has been the hardest thing I've ever done, and I couldn't have even contemplated it without my brothers,"" said Ewan. ""There have been countless setbacks to overcome, some leaving us lost, but we've always lifted each other up. ""Days before landing in Cairns, brothers said they had to battle currents off the coast. ""We're going to be rowing three up as we navigate through the Great Barrier Reef and away from shipping lanes, all while fighting against horrendous winds,"" they said.The brothers were raising money for clean water projects in Madagascar. They broke three world records crossing the Atlantic Ocean in 2020, without ever having rowed professionally, making the journey from La Gomera in Canary Islands to Antigua in 35 days.","Ewan, Jamie and Lachlan MacLean set off in a carbon fibre dinghy from Lima in Peru in April.
