So we've got to be a little mindful of that and see what best we can do. That is what the experience in the dressing room is all about and we have got a lot of that,"" Rohit stated.India's warm-up match against Bangladesh at the same venue, which they won by 60 runs, provided insights into the difficult batting conditions. Rohit pointed out the necessity of adapting quickly to these surfaces.""We are all coming off playing in IPL where a lot of runs were scored, so it's important to have that balance, understand what is required here. It's certainly not going to be IPL kind of scores here, so we are very mindful of that and we just need to assess as quickly as possible and then bring your game into the picture,"" he added.The Indian skipper also highlighted the importance of finding the right team composition, particularly the balance between seamers and spinners. Reflecting on their match against Bangladesh, Rohit noted the effectiveness of spin on these pitches.""When we played the game with Bangladesh, all three spinners bowled two overs. It wasn't that easy to hit them. And in yesterday's match (SA versus SL), the spinners also took wickets. No one knows the conditions,"" Rohit explained.As Team India prepares to face Ireland on Wednesday, the talk of breaking their ICC title drought since 2013 has resurfaced. Reflecting on this, Rohit stressed the importance of staying focused on the present.""I have thought a lot about this thing. I am just going to go and play the way I can and get everyone together to play as a team. I will be focusing on that. Everyone in the team has their own way of dealing with tournaments like World Cup and I'm sure they'll take the right calls as well. But for me, it's important not to look too far ahead. Just think about what we need to do tomorrow, play the game well and then take it from there. Not think too much and put pressure on yourself,"" Rohit said.Following their opener against Ireland, India will take on arch-rivals Pakistan in New York on June 9.","Team India captain Rohit Sharma has set realistic expectations for fans regarding scoring at the Nassau County International Stadium.

T20 World Cup: An air of unpredictability as India face Ireland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-an-air-of-unpredictability-as-india-face-ireland/articleshow/110718417.cms,"India embark on another quest for the elusive World T20 trophy against minnows

Ireland

today, but the morning start and a dodgy pitch could make it a bit of a lottery

NEW YORK: A quaint, little community park tucked away in one corner of a posh Long Island locality isn't quite the venue that you associate with an Indian practice session, that too ahead of a World Cup opener.But it's a changing cricket world and India are the brand ambassadors of a movement which aims to take the sport beyond the noise and bustle of South Asia. Close to Eisenhower Park, in a newly-built, born out of scratch Nassau County Ground, Rohit Sharma 's boys start their journey in the T20 World Cup against a team that they are supposed to blow away in a jiffy.Ireland, ideally, shouldn't pose a serious threat to the Indian juggernaut. But there's an air of unpredictability about the venue, and more importantly the pitch in play, ahead of the day-match, a rarity in T20s. All of India's games are at 10:30 am local-time starts, which allows the Indian audience back home to latch on to some 8 pm cricket entertainment at the end of day's work or the roller-coaster of Lok Sabha results.But morning starts with white-ball has its pitfalls - the ball tends to do a lot more than normal. On Monday, Sri Lanka managed only 77 against South Africa on a drop-in pitch at the same venue and they made it extremely tough for the Proteas to go past that score. ""Had we got 120, it could have been a different game,"" Sri Lankan captain Wanindu Hasaranga said, which may not be music to the ears of any team which will be playing here.The worrying bit about the pitch is the up-and-down nature of it, which makes it incredibly difficult for stroke-play that we are used to on a daily basis. Ire land aren't full of stars who can scare India, but on a pitch where it can be a bit of a lottery, you can never be sure. From an Indian perspective, there is no scope of a let's-take-it-easy approach, because any adverse result can make it a do-or-die situation for them in the game against Pakistan, something that India would be desperate to avoid.Interestingly, it was 17 years ago in an ODI World Cup in West Indies, where India's outgoing coach Rahul Dravid was the captain, India lost to Bangladesh in the opener and consequently crashed out before the Super-8 stage.The Indian batting legend surely wouldn't want a repeat of that trauma on his coaching farewell and that's why he insists on ""adaptability"" before the ball rolls.""All venues will not be the same. It can always happen that we will have pitches where 140 will be enough. The challenge is to adapt and play accordingly,"" Dravid said on Monday ahead of a practice session.Captain Rohit Sharma added to that on Tuesday when he said ""it is about dealing with the unknown"". ""Everything is unknown, the venue, the pitch, the opposition. But we have the experience,"" Rohit said, his usual nonchalance written all over.If all goes to plan, Virat Kohli and Rohit should open the batting, leaving the middle-order duties to Suryakumar Yadav , Shivam Dube, Rishabh Pant, Hardik Pandya , Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel.The three allrounders Pandya, Jadeja and Axar should give the team the flexibility in the bowling line-up, whereby they can play six bowlers --the other three being Jasprit Bumrah , Arshdeep Singh and Kuldeep Yadav.Left-arm pace Arshdeep bowled quite splendidly in the practice match that India played against Bangladesh on Saturday, where he moved the ball around in the first few overs, making life difficult for the Bangla batters. Mohammed Siraj, though, isn't far behind, especially with the pitch affording variable bounce, and it could be a coin-toss between the two.""We have some plans but we're not divulging anything for now. It's the start of a journey and we don't want to look too far ahead,"" Rohit said.We don't mind that one bit, as long as India are there in Barbados 25 days from now.","India begin their World T20 campaign against minnows Ireland in New York.

The troll army questioned Khan's fitness and his selection in the national team.""I also praise him side by side. He is strong, powerful; his hitting is tremendous,"" said Afridi, before talking about Khan's wicketkeeping. ""As far as 'keeping, the ball caries in English conditions.

England's revised target, according to the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method, was set at 109 runs off 10 overs.The Scottish openers, Michael Jones and George Munsey , showcased an attractive array of strokes, keeping the English bowlers under pressure throughout their innings.Jones remained unbeaten on 45 off 30 balls, hitting two sixes and four fours, while Munsey scored an unbeaten 41 off 31 deliveries, also striking four boundaries.Munsey had a stroke of luck when Mark Wood overstepped the crease after seemingly dismissing him, with skipper Jos Buttler taking a fine catch running behind.The match experienced several rain interruptions, starting with a delay in the commencement of the game due to a wet spot on the pitch caused by a passing shower.The longest break occurred right after the powerplay, with Scotland in a commanding position at 51 for no loss in 6.2 overs.

If we cannot, even then we have to find our way,"" said the skipper.The spin attack features wrist spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal, adding to the team's potency.Rohit acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding the conditions and emphasized the importance of finding the best combination that suits the team's needs, whether it involves playing all three spinners or relying on the seamers.""When we played the game with Bangladesh, all three spinners bowled two overs. It wasn't that easy to hit them. And in yesterday's match (SA versus SL), the spinners also took wickets. No one knows the conditions.""The spinners will take wickets or the seamers will take.

I am just going to go and play the way I can and get everyone together to play as a team. I will be focusing on that. Everyone in the team have their own way of dealing with tournaments like World Cup and I'm sure they'll take the right calls as well.""But for me, it's important not to look too far ahead. Just think about what we need to do tomorrow, play the game well and then take it from there. Not think too much and put pressure on yourself,"" said Rohit.He is also excited about playing in New York for the first time.""We never thought cricket in America will be played at any given stage. But now that we are here, it's a different feeling, right? From the time you arrived in New York, pending only 10 minutes at immigration, which is very rare, doesn't happen.""So you can make out that the buzz is there, even the locals here are quite intrigued by a cricket tournament happening, a world cup happening here, because we go to the cafes and all, there are a lot of locals who come there and wish us the best. We've been to Florida, but this is different.""All of us who are playing here we will try to leave a mark on this city and the people of US as well,"" he added.","India's T20 World Cup squad boasts four all-rounders.

But again, the one thing that we've constantly been trying to focus on is being adaptable, being versatile. We're not here to have a holiday; we're here to play cricket,"" he said.""At the end of the day, it's not controllable. Whether we can train there or not, there's no training facilities there.""For us, we don't need to spend mental energy on that (and) rather spend our mental energy on having clear plans, doing our preparation work and making sure that everyone is aware of how that can impact the game,"" Malan added.",Ireland take on India in their T20 World Cup opener in New York on Wednesday. Irish coach Heinrich Malan is optimistic about his team's chances.

NEW DELHI: Pat Cummins , the captain of the Australian ODI team , feels that his ability to remain composed while leading a team is an innate trait.In the 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL) season, Cummins also captained the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and achieved remarkable success, guiding his team to the finals, where they were defeated by Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) on May 26.Under Cummins' leadership, the Orange Army transformed their fortunes, rising from the lower half of the standings to play an aggressive brand of cricket, spearheaded by the captain himself and openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma .Reflecting on his personal growth, Cummins stated, the more he has played cricket, the more he has 'mellowed' with such qualities. He also emphasised that currently, his primary focus is on his individual performance on the field.""I think to some degree I was born with it. I have always kind of had this 'shall be right' kind of attitude. The more I have played, the more I have mellowed a little bit in terms of not being as fiery, and you just want to concentrate on how to get the job done. As a young bowler I wanted to puff the chest out and really get into the opposition. Nowadays I'm a bit more concentrating on my own game, and as captain, trying to navigate as calmly as possible our team to, hopefully, a victory. Maybe it is experience, maybe it is [that] I try and talk about calmness a lot, so if I'm captain and I'm not calm, well, I'll lose a bit of credibility with my team-mates,"" Cummins was quoted by ESPNcricinfo's The Cricket Monthly as saying.""Look, I think so. On balance, when you are making so many decisions all the time, a level of calmness and consistency probably outweighs someone who's erratic, I would say,"" he added.","Pat Cummins is the captain of the Australian ODI team.

Despite a late surge from the non-qualifying Finnish team, Portugal maintained control for the majority of the game, showcasing their attacking prowess and providing valuable experience for their evolving squad.With captain Cristiano Ronaldo rested ahead of the tournament, manager Roberto Martinez took the opportunity to experiment with his lineup, fielding a significantly altered team compared to previous outings. This tactical decision proved effective, with Portugal dominating possession and creating numerous scoring opportunities from the outset.The Portuguese dominance materialized into an early lead when defender Ruben Dias expertly headed in a corner kick in the 17th minute. Their advantage was further solidified just before halftime when Diogo Jota confidently converted a penalty earned by Francisco Conceicao , who was fouled inside the penalty area.The second half saw Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes enter the fray as part of a five-player substitution. The change injected fresh impetus into the Portuguese attack, with Fernandes making an immediate impact by curling a beautiful shot into the top corner from the edge of the box, extending the lead to 3-0.Finland, however, refused to be completely overshadowed. Substitute Teemu Pukki capitalized on a brief lapse in concentration from the Portuguese defence, netting two goals in quick succession and bringing his team back into contention.Despite the unexpected Finnish resurgence, Portugal weathered the storm and regained control of the game. Bruno Fernandes, once again proving his worth, sealed the victory with a close-range finish in the 84th minute, securing a 4-2 win for Portugal.This friendly served as a valuable exercise for Portugal, allowing them to fine-tune their tactics and provide game time for players who may feature prominently in the upcoming tournament.

NEW DELHI: Real Madrid secured a record-extending 15th Champions League title with a 2-0 victory over Borussia Dortmund at Wembley Stadium .The Spanish side, known for their resilience and experience in high-stakes matches, weathered a dominant first-half performance from Dortmund before capitalizing on their opportunities in the second half.Dortmund, appearing in their first Champions League final since 2013, started brightly and created numerous scoring chances. Karim Adeyemi, Niclas Füllkrug, Julian Brandt, and Marcel Sabitzer all came close to breaking the deadlock, but Thibaut Courtois, in his fifth appearance of an injury-interrupted season, produced several crucial saves to keep Real Madrid level.Despite Dortmund's early pressure, Real Madrid remained composed and gradually grew into the game in the second half. Toni Kroos tested Gregor Kobel with a free-kick before Dani Carvajal broke the deadlock in the 74th minute, heading in a Kroos corner.The goal shifted the momentum decisively in Real Madrid's favour. Vinicius Jr. doubled their lead in the 83rd minute, finishing clinically after being released by Jude Bellingham's misplaced pass. Although Füllkrug had a late goal ruled out for offside, Dortmund were unable to mount a comeback.The victory marked Real Madrid's sixth Champions League title in 11 seasons, a testament to their sustained dominance in the competition.Carlo Ancelotti , already a two-time Champions League winner as a player with AC Milan, secured his fifth title as a manager, further cementing his legacy as one of the most successful coaches in the tournament's history.Dortmund, with their energetic pressing and direct attacking play, posed a significant threat, particularly in the first half. However, Real Madrid's experience, tactical discipline, and clinical finishing ultimately proved decisive. Their ability to absorb pressure and punish opponents on the counter-attack, a hallmark of their recent successes, was once again on full display.","Real Madrid secure a record-extending 15th Champions League title with a 2-0 victory over Borussia Dortmund at Wembley Stadium.

Dortmund coach Edin Terzic optimistic ahead of Champions League final against Real Madrid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/dortmund-coach-edin-terzic-optimistic-ahead-of-champions-league-final-against-real-madrid/articleshow/110620925.cms,"(Inputs from AFP)

NEW DELHI: Borussia Dortmund coach Edin Terzic believes ""anything is possible"" as his team prepares to face the formidable Real Madrid in the Champions League final at London's Wembley Stadium on Saturday.Real Madrid enters the final as heavy favorites, aiming to secure their 15th European title and sixth in the last 11 seasons. They face a Dortmund side that has already defied expectations by reaching the final.Despite Real Madrid's dominance this season, having lost just twice in 54 games and clinched the La Liga title with a 10-point lead, they had to overcome significant challenges to reach the Champions League final, as described by coach Carlo Ancelotti .""We have to enjoy being here,"" said Ancelotti at his pre-match press conference. ""But knowing it can go wrong because we are close to the most important thing in football – winning a Champions League – but having the fear this can escape us.""Ancelotti's squad showcased resilience by overcoming defending champions Manchester City on penalties in the quarter-finals and staging a legendary late comeback against Bayern Munich in the semi-finals at the Santiago Bernabeu.""We never stop believing, no matter how the circumstances are,"" said Luka Modric . Along with Nacho, Dani Carvajal, and Toni Kroos—playing his final match for the club—Modric could win the European Cup for a record-equalling sixth time. ""We always believe, keep believing, keep pushing, fighting until the end. In the end, we manage to find a way to beat opponents. Many people say there is luck, but when it happens so many times, I think it's not just luck.""Borussia Dortmund faces the challenge of overcoming a significant financial gap with Real Madrid as they aim to secure their second Champions League title. Last season, Madrid boasted record revenues of 831 million euros ($901 million), while Dortmund's stood at 420 million euros, according to Deloitte.The trajectory of Jude Bellingham 's career underscores Dortmund's challenge. Initially signed from English Championship side Birmingham as a teenager, Bellingham was developed by Dortmund before being transferred to Madrid for over 100 million euros a year ago. Dortmund struggled in the Bundesliga this season, finishing fifth and trailing Bayer Leverkusen by 27 points.Despite these challenges, Terzic's team has excelled in the Champions League, reaching the final for the third time and the first since their defeat to Bayern Munich at Wembley 11 years ago. Dortmund emerged as the victors of a challenging group that included Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan, and Newcastle. They then defeated PSV Eindhoven and Atletico Madrid before a remarkable defensive effort secured a victory over PSG in the semi-finals.""They are the favourites but we don’t care,"" said Terzic. ""We haven’t been the favourites against Atletico or against PSG. But if we are brave and not here to watch Real Madrid lift the trophy, if we are here to give them a game, then we have a chance.""Despite Dortmund being allocated only 30,000 tickets for the 90,000-capacity stadium, over 100,000 fans are estimated to have traveled to London. UEFA will aim to keep the focus on the on-field action, hoping their choice of Wembley for the final won't be scrutinized. The Euro 2020 final saw violence as ticketless fans breached the stadium, prompting the English Football Association to invest £5 million ($6 million) in enhancing safety and infrastructure at Wembley. Wembley is also scheduled to host the Euro 2028 final.","Borussia Dortmund coach Edin Terzic believes ""anything is possible"" as his team prepares to face the formidable Real Madrid in the Champions League final at London's Wembley Stadium.

Watch: Cristiano Ronaldo breaks down after Al Nassr's defeat in King's Cup final,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/watch-cristiano-ronaldo-breaks-down-after-al-nassrs-defeat-in-kings-cup-final/articleshow/110609219.cms,"(With AP inputs)

Cristiano Ronaldo was overcome with emotion as he departed the field in tears following Al-Nassr 's defeat to Al-Hilal in the King’s Cup final in Saudi Arabia, marking another season without major silverware for his team.In a tense showdown in Jeddah that concluded 1-1 after extra time, Al-Hilal clinched victory in a penalty shootout, prevailing 5-4. Ronaldo, who joined Al-Nassr in December 2022, was visibly distraught, collapsing to the ground before being comforted by his teammates at King Abdullah Sports City.The disappointment came after the conclusion of the Saudi Pro League four days ago, where Al-Nassr finished second, trailing Al-Hilal by 14 points. Ronaldo's individual achievement of setting a new league record with 35 goals provided some solace, but it was not enough to offset the team's longing for the championship.The final match was marked by intensity, witnessing two goals and three red cards. Al-Hilal took an early lead with Aleksandar Mitrovic's header after just seven minutes. Al-Nassr suffered a setback in the second half when goalkeeper David Ospina was ejected for handling the ball outside the area.The drama escalated when Ali Al-Bulaihi of Al-Hilal was also sent off for a headbutt on Sami Al-Najei. Al-Nassr seized the opportunity, equalizing with Ayman Yahya's header moments later.As tensions soared, Al-Hilal's Kalidou Koulibaly received his second yellow card, reducing his team to ten men. After the stalemate in extra time, the fate of the match was decided by a penalty shootout.Although both teams missed their initial attempts, Ronaldo converted his penalty. However, Al-Hilal emerged victorious as Bounou saved crucial penalties from Ali Al-Hassan and Al-Nemer, securing their 11th King’s Cup title.For Ronaldo and his team, the wait for silverware continues into the next season.","Al-Nassr lost 5-4 on penalties to Al-Hilal in the King's Cup final in Jeddah.

NEW DELHI: Carlos Alcaraz secured his place in the French Open semifinals after defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets (6-3, 7-6 (7/3), 6-4). This victory sets up a highly anticipated clash with Jannik Sinner , who is poised to become the new world number one .Alcaraz maintained composure throughout the match, showcasing his dominance over Tsitsipas, whom he has now defeated in all six of their encounters. The Spaniard's powerful performance echoed his previous year's quarterfinal win against Tsitsipas at Roland Garros .

I think right now he's the best player in the world, the player who's playing the best tennis right now.""""I'm grateful to have him (Sinner) on the tour, at this level because he pushes me to be my best level... to wake up in the morning to try to get better to try to beat him. It's going to be a really good challenge, I'm ready for that challenge. It's the match that everybody wants to watch. I'm sure he'll show his best tennis, I will as well, so let's see who's going to win,"" added the Spaniard.The absence of Djokovic, who withdrew due to a knee injury, paves the way for a new men's champion at Roland Garros. The winner of the Alcaraz-Sinner match is expected to be the favourite in the final, facing either Alexander Zverev, Casper Ruud, or Alex de Minaur.Alcaraz expressed disappointment over Djokovic's withdrawal, acknowledging the impact on fans who were deprived of witnessing one of the sport's greatest players.However, his focus remains on the challenge ahead, aiming to deliver his best performance against Sinner and secure a place in the final.","Carlos Alcaraz defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets (6-3, 7-6 (7/3), 6-4) This victory sets up a highly anticipated clash with Jannik Sinner, who is poised to become the new world number one.

Iga Swiatek invites Steffi Graf comparison with French Open rout,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/french-open/iga-swiatek-invites-steffi-graf-comparison-with-french-open-rout/articleshow/110712455.cms,"(With AFP inputs)

NEW DELHI: Iga Swiatek expressed her gratitude for being likened to Steffi Graf , the 22-time Grand Slam champion, as the Polish world number one continued her impressive winning streak at the French Open , reaching 19 matches on Tuesday.In a dominant display, Swiatek overwhelmed Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova with a scoreline of 6-0, 6-2, securing her place in the semi-finals and edging closer to a potential third consecutive Roland Garros title in Paris.Her record at the French Open is now an impressive 33-2 across six appearances, and she is widely regarded as the favourite to reach another final. Swiatek has consistently outperformed her upcoming opponent, Coco Gauff , winning 10 out of their 11 encounters in straight sets.As Swiatek sets her sights on becoming only the fourth woman in the Open era to claim four Roland Garros singles titles, she finds herself in the company of tennis legends Chris Evert , Justine Henin, and Steffi Graf, who achieved this remarkable feat and dominated the women's game during the late 1980s and much of the 1990s.Graf, now 54 years old, remains the last player to complete a calendar Grand Slam, a feat she accomplished in 1988 by winning all four major titles and securing the Olympic singles gold medal in the same year.Swiatek's recent performances have been reminiscent of Graf's dominance, particularly her 6-0, 6-0 thrashing of Anastasia Potapova, which echoed Graf's 32-minute demolition of Natasha Zvereva in the 1988 Roland Garros final.""She's a great champion, and, well, it's just nice that anybody would compare me to her,"" said Swiatek, who at one point won 20 consecutive games stretching across her last-16 and quarter-final ties.""I don't know her, but I feel like maybe she was kind of a similar person to me because she also likes to keep her privacy,"" added Swiatek.""I also heard from some people on tour that she was also kind of like an introvert, really in the zone and just focusing on tennis and what she wants to do.""Swiatek's performance against Vondrousova was a display of her increasing dominance on clay courts. The Polish player's game continues to improve, which is a daunting prospect for her competitors.""Getting better and better,"" Swiatek remarked about her own play following the match. Vondrousova, seeded fifth and a finalist at Roland Garros in 2019, was overwhelmed by Swiatek's masterful performance, unable to find a way to counter her opponent's strategy.""She's I feel like way better than anyone else on clay, and especially here,"" said Vondrousova.""I feel like on the court you have nothing to, I don't know, maybe offer or she's just, you know, she's just too strong here.""I feel like you just go crazy every point.""","Iga Swiatek beats Marketa Vondrousova 6-0, 6-2 to reach French Open semi-finals. Polish world number one has now won 19 matches in a row at Roland Garros. She will play Coco Gauff in the semi-final, who she has beaten 10 times in straight sets. Swiatesk has been likened to Steffi Graf, the 22-time Grand Slam champion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110712444,imgsize-47184,width-400,resizemode-4/110712444.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic withdrew from the French Open on Tuesday, just before his scheduled quarter-final match against Casper Ruud . The decision came after the Serbian star sustained a knee injury during his previous match in Paris.Djokovic's unexpected exit from the tournament was announced shortly before he was set to take the court against his Norwegian opponent. The severity of the injury, which occurred in the round prior to the quarter-finals, ultimately forced the former world No. 1 to pull out of the competition.""I am really sad to announce that I have to withdraw from Roland Garros ,"" Djokovic wrote on social media.""I played with my heart and gave my all in yesterday's match and unfortunately, due to a medial meniscus tear in my right knee, my team and I had to make a tough decision after careful consideration and consultation.""The organizers of the tournament initially declared Djokovic's withdrawal, stating that an MRI scan performed earlier on Tuesday had fully revealed the extent of his injury.Djokovic, the world's top-ranked player and winner of 24 Grand Slam titles, was scheduled to face Ruud on Wednesday in a quarterfinal match. In last year's Roland Garros final, Djokovic had defeated Ruud in straight sets.Consequently, Ruud will advance to the semi-finals on Friday, where he will face either the fourth-seeded Alexander Zverev or the 11th-seeded Alex de Minaur.Following his five-set victory over Francisco Cerundolo on Monday, the 37-year-old Djokovic had expressed uncertainty about his physical condition, acknowledging that he required anti-inflammatory medication to complete the match.Djokovic attributed the injury he sustained early in the second set of his 6-1, 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 win over Cerundolo to the ""slippery"" surface of the Philippe Chatrier court.""I don't know what will happen tomorrow or after tomorrow if I'll be able to step out on the court and play. You know, I hope so. Let's see what happens,"" Djokovic said after his record 370th win at a Grand Slam.""For the last couple weeks I have had, I would say, slight discomfort, I would call it that way, in the right knee, but I haven't had an injury that would be concerning me at all.""I was playing a few tournaments with it, and no issues until today.""Djokovic's physical endurance was pushed to the brink in the third round, as he battled through a marathon match against Lorenzo Musetti that lasted four hours and 29 minutes, setting a new record for the latest finish in French Open history at 3:07 am on Sunday.During the match with Musetti, Djokovic expressed dissatisfaction with the condition of the clay court, and he reiterated his concerns in the round of 16, requesting that the court be swept more frequently to maintain its quality.""Could this injury have been prevented? ""Possibly, if there was just a little bit more of a frequent care of the court,"" Djokovic said.Jannik Sinner is set to make history as the first Italian to claim the world number one ranking in tennis after Djokovic's sudden withdrawal.""It's every player's dream to become number one in the world. On the other hand, seeing Novak retiring (from the tournament) is disappointing, so I wish him a speedy recovery,"" said Sinner.Sinner secured his maiden semi-final appearance at Roland Garros shortly after Djokovic's unexpected departure from the tournament. The Italian rising star triumphed over Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov, the 10th seed, in a three-set battle.Djokovic entered the French Open with his world No. 1 ranking under threat from Sinner, who was assured of overtaking the Serbian if the latter failed to reach the final in Paris. The 36-year-old has held the top spot for an unprecedented 428 weeks.The early exit marks Djokovic's most challenging start to a season since 2018, when his first title of the year came at Wimbledon . Compounding his difficulties, he was inadvertently struck on the head by a metal water bottle in Rome last month and experienced digestive issues in Geneva.Djokovic's last retirement at a Grand Slam occurred during the 2019 US Open, when a shoulder injury forced him to withdraw against Stan Wawrinka in the fourth round. He now faces a tight timeline to recover for Wimbledon, which commences on July 1.Djokovic has claimed seven titles at the All England Club, just one short of Roger Federer 's record.",World No. 1 Novak Djokovic withdraws from French Open with knee injury.
