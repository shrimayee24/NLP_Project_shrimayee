Washington Sundar on X (Screengrab)

Poll What do you think was the key factor in India's remarkable draw at Old Trafford? Washington Sundar's performance Ravindra Jadeja's contribution Team's ability to absorb pressure England's missed opportunities

“Grateful for the people, and forever grateful to you, God,” wrote Washington Sundar on X after scoring his maiden Test hundred — a composed, unbeaten 101* that helped India pull off a dramatic draw against England in the fourth Test at Old Trafford.The 25-year-old all-rounder’s quiet gratitude came after a loud statement on the field, where he and Ravindra Jadeja (107) batted through the final phase of Day 5 to rescue India from what once looked like certain defeat. Reduced to 0/2 at the start of their second innings, India needed a miracle. They found it in the form of a rock-solid batting effort, with Shubman Gill (103) and KL Rahul (90) also playing key roles.The final session was filled with tension — England’s frustration began to show, especially after Jadeja launched a six off Harry Brook to reach his hundred. In a curious moment, Brook stepped forward with a handshake offer, seemingly looking to wrap up the game.But Sundar , just short of his own milestone, ignored the gesture and carried on. The image of Brook’s puzzled smile and Sundar’s calm focus summed up the psychological edge India held at the end.This was just the second draw for England in 40 Tests under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, which was a rare occurrence in their aggressive ‘Bazball’ era. But it was a deserved result for India, whose batters absorbed immense pressure to ensure the series stays alive at 2-1.With the possibility of leveling the series still on the line, the stage is set for a cracking finale at The Oval. But for now, Sundar’s words and his resolve linger as the high point of a chaotic final day.",Washington Sundar scored 101* to help India draw 4th Test at Old Trafford. Ravindra Jadeja (107) and Shubman Gill (103) also made centuries. England were reduced to 0/2 at the start of their second innings. The series is now 2-1 with the final Test at The Oval.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122944929,imgsize-147548,width-400,resizemode-4/122944929.jpg"
Sydney Sweeney's jeans ad sparks 'white supremacy' backlash: White House calls outrage 'moronic'; says this is why 'Americans voted for Trump',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sydney-sweeneys-jeans-ad-sparks-white-supremacy-backlash-white-house-calls-outrage-moronic-says-this-is-why-americans-voted-for-trump/articleshow/123009271.cms,"



Donald Trump’s White House communications chief, Steven Cheung, has hit out at the backlash over actress Sydney Sweeney ’s new American Eagle jeans ad, calling the outrage “moronic” and blaming it on “cancel culture.”He argued that this kind of controversy is exactly why Donald Trump won the 2024 election, saying Americans are “tired of this.”Cheung dismissed the backlash as yet another example of cancel culture gone too far. “Cancel culture runs amok. This warped, moronic, and dense liberal thinking is a big reason why Americans voted the way they did in 2024. They're tired of this bulls**t,” he wrote on X.The controversy centers around a play on words, “great jeans” which many saw as a reference to her genetics rather than just the denim she wore.The ad features the 27-year-old Euphoria star as she is seen in a nostalgic Americana setting, fixing a car and driving while wearing American Eagle jeans.The campaign tagline, “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans,” plays on the word “genes.”In a video, Sweeney uses red paint to change the word “genes” to “jeans” and says in a voiceover: “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color.My jeans are blue.”While meant to be lighthearted, the campaign sparked outrage online, with critics accusing it of celebrating Sweeney’s whiteness and thin physique.Some even went as far with several viral responses criticising the advertisement claiming it promotes racial superiority, eugenic ideologies, and Nazi-like propaganda regarding a superior race.Cheung wasn’t the only conservative to criticise the backlash over the ad. TV host Megyn Kelly also slammed the reaction, calling it “absurd” on her podcast and blaming the “lunatic left” for stirring up unnecessary outrage.“She’s being called a white supremacist by people who don’t like her latest ad, which is for American Eagle,” Kelly said.""She’s advertising jeans, and yet the lunatics on the left think she’s advertising white supremacy. This is obviously a reference to her body and not to her skin color, but the lunatic left is going to do what the lunatic left is going to do,"" she added.Kelly argued that critics are ""upset because it's about who gets to be the face of America's Best Genes. They think it's no accident that they've chosen a white, thin woman because you're, I guess, not allowed to celebrate those things in any way, shape, or form. But they're completely ignoring the reference to her body, which is the thing she's famous for. It's just absurd.""","Steven Cheung, the White House communications chief, has slammed the backlash over Sydney Sweeney’s new American Eagle jeans ad.

NHL goalie Carter Hart reportedly draws interest from Ottawa Senators

NHL continues ban even after Carter Hart, others found not guilty



FAQs



Is Carter Hart cleared to play in the NHL?



Why are the Ottawa Senators interested in Carter Hart?



What happened in the 2018 WJC case?



Are other NHL teams interested in the cleared players?



In a surprising twist following the fallout of the 2018 World Junior Championship sexual assault case, NHL goalie Carter Hart may soon find himself back in contention, but not with the team he was once linked to. With the Edmonton Oilers reportedly uninterested, all signs now point toward another Canadian franchise stepping into the conversation: the Ottawa Senators.Last week, Hart and four other players, Michael McLeod, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dubé, and Cal Foote, were acquitted in the long-running WJC investigation. Despite being found not guilty, the National Hockey League (NHL) deemed the allegations “very disturbing”. It issued an indefinite suspension against all five, rendering them ineligible to play until further review.But in a developing twist, speculation is mounting around the Ottawa Senators making a move. Reports suggest the franchise is monitoring Hart’s situation closely and could extend a contract offer as soon as league permissions allow. Among the five exonerated players, Carter Hart is widely viewed as the most likely to make a successful return to the league.Legal and sports analysts alike believe that the road to reinstatement could open sooner than expected, especially if public and media sentiment shifts in Hart’s favor. His willingness to testify in court may also play a role in rebuilding his professional image.No, the NHL has currently ruled Hart and four other players ineligible, pending further review.Hart is considered the most NHL-ready among the cleared players and may fill Ottawa’s long-standing goaltending gap.Hart and four others were accused in a 2018 assault case but were found not guilty in court this month.Yes, reports suggest that a few NHL teams may be exploring options, particularly for Carter Hart and Michael McLeod.If the Ottawa Senators do make a move, they’ll be betting on both talent and time.

Why Trey Hendrickson’s presence matters for Bengals

Cincinnati Bengals star defensive end Trey Hendrickson has ended his brief training camp holdout, but not without leaving fans and analysts buzzing. After skipping the first week of camp in a push for a contract extension, the All-Pro pass rusher returned with a blunt, four-word message: “Nothing has really changed. ” His statement perfectly captures the ongoing tension between star players seeking security and teams balancing their salary cap.Hendrickson, who turns 31 this season, is coming off a career-best 17.5 sacks, leading the NFL and cementing himself as one of the league’s premier pass rushers. Despite his dominance, he remains without a new long-term deal and is seeking guaranteed money beyond the 2025 season.His brief absence was a clear signal to the Bengals’ front office, yet his return follows a growing NFL trend known as the “hold-in”—where players report to camp to avoid daily fines while still expressing contract frustrations.Quarterback Joe Burrow didn’t sugarcoat the financial side of Hendrickson’s decision to return. “Guys don’t want to get fined… it’s 50K a day. That’s not pennies. That’s probably part of it,” Burrow said, highlighting the NFL’s harsh penalty for holdouts. Burrow also stressed that Hendrickson’s presence is invaluable for team chemistry, even if negotiations remain unsettled.“Whenever you can have a guy like that in the building… it’s good to see his face, good to have his presence.He’s going to play a big part of this team this year.”Trey Hendrickson briefly skipped Bengals training camp to push for a contract extension and secure more guaranteed money beyond the 2025 season.After returning to Bengals camp, Trey Hendrickson said, “Nothing has really changed,” signaling that his contract situation remains unresolved.Joe Burrow said it was good to have Hendrickson’s presence back in the building and noted that avoiding $50,000 daily fines likely influenced his return.For Cincinnati, having Hendrickson back is critical as the team eyes another playoff run. His leadership and relentless pass-rushing ability are cornerstones of Lou Anarumo’s defense. Even without a new deal, his decision to show up prevents further distractions and keeps the Bengals’ locker room focused on football.Also Read: ""I don’t mind adding more""—Brian Flores addresses Vikings’ interest in Christian Wilkins after Raiders release While “Nothing has really changed” on paper, Hendrickson’s quiet return speaks volumes.

The blockbuster trade: Mitch Marner to Vegas Golden Knights

FAQ’s

Q1. Why did Toronto trade Mitch Marner?

Q2. Which team did Marner join in 2025?

Q3. How long was Mitch Marner with Toronto?

After about a decade in the Maple Leafs jersey, Mitch Marner’s career looks to take quite a dramatic turn as he prepares to skate for the Vegas Golden Knights. While the ride westward is undoubtedly a new and major chapter in his hockey career, it is also one that is very deeply personal to him. The Toronto native, having always grown up dreaming of a Stanley Cup that would be coming home to his place, is now hoping to work through a franchise that, on the other hand, has been hugely successful recently and has emerged as a very strong culture.Mitch Marner's 2025 playtime started with promise, but it soon deteriorated as the Toronto Maple Leafs failed to realize their championship dreams. Despite Marner putting up 13 points in the playoffs, he fell off the radar in Game 7 versus the Florida Panthers, as his side endured a gut-wrenching 6–1 loss, thus inviting all sorts of heavy criticism. Marner was visibly frustrated, even yelling at some teammates on the bench, a sight that only brought home to the powers that be the extent of his anguish as well as the expectations heaped upon him as the hometown hero.Assisting Auston Matthews for a Game 6 goal was a brief flurry of hope that could not revive Toronto's playoff run. Again, as the Leafs stumbled at this same round of the playoffs, Marner's moment in the postseason was overshadowed by an implosion from his teammates.These playoff performances, coupled with pressure from fans and media alike, seemed to spur talk of a new chapter.June 30, 2023: The Maple Leafs pulled off another high-level sign-and-trade. Mitch Marner signed an eight-year, $96 million extension with Toronto before being sent to Vegas in exchange for Nicolas Roy. For Marner, this was more than business, though-it was a welcome chance.He would later figure out why Vegas was absolutely on the top of his list. In Vegas, Marner said the emphasis lay on the winning atmosphere and culture of the team, and hence, in his eyes, there was much more to it than calling it an escape from Toronto's intense glare. There was a real opportunity to be a part of a roster that genuinely has a shot at lifting the Stanley Cup. He also added that, on a personal level, life in his new city suits his young family, so the decision was as much a family one as it was a business one.Also Read: Connor McDavid’s wife Lauren McDavid joins Mark McMorris for the French‑side wedding adventure of Leon Draisaitl and Celeste Desjardins As Mitch Marner turns the page to join the Vegas Golden Knights, he shall take with him the teachings and the legacy of his years in Toronto.

Philadelphia Phillies fans caught in apparent s*x act at Yankee Stadium as stunned onlookers film the incident

Such explicit activity was not the first and possibly not the last



FAQs

Who were the teams playing during the incident at Yankee Stadium?

Has there been any official response from the Yankees?

Is this the first time such an act has occurred at a baseball game?

A shocking video from Yankee Stadium has ignited a social media firestorm, as a young couple, one of whom was wearing Philadelphia Phillies gear, was visibly caught in the middle of a s*x act during a live game. The clip, initially shared on TikTok and later reposted on X, sparked widespread outrage and disbelief.While the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Phillies faced off in a three-game weekend series, the baseball action was not the only thing that ended up trending. The video, believed to be filmed during one of the afternoon matchups, shows a man in a Phillies jersey and cap seated beside a woman in jean shorts and a tank top. Captured from behind by another fan, the footage appears to show the couple engaging in a se*ual act, right in the middle of a crowded stadium section.Despite the absence of fans directly beside or behind the couple, they were well within view of dozens of nearby spectators. In the original clip, one stunned onlooker is heard saying, ""This is f—king insane."" The incident happened in the bright light of day. The pair kept their eyes on the game while their hands told another story.A second version of the video surfaced shortly afterward, showing the woman becoming visibly more animated. The man then appears to place his finger in his mouth after the act, a moment that was called out by amused (and horrified) viewers. The stadium reaction was a mix of laughter and complete disbelief.Public se*ual encounters at ballparks are, surprisingly, not unheard of. In 2022, a couple was caught engaging in a similar act at an Oakland Athletics game. A decade earlier, two fans were found having s*x in the bathrooms at Yankee Stadium during a game against the Tampa Bay Rays. And just last year, OnlyFans model Kaylee Killion claimed she and her fiancé had s*x in the parking lot during Super Bowl LVIII.As for the Yankees, they went on to win Sunday’s finale 4-3, though the Phillies claimed the series overall. The team has yet to release a statement regarding the incident, and it remains unclear whether the couple involved will face any consequences. So far, the identity of the couple is also not known but the incident has certainly raised eyebrows. The original video was shared multiple times across different platforms racking up millions of views.Also Read: UFC commentator Joe Rogan slams violent medieval sport Calcio Storico still celebrated in Florence The New York Yankees were hosting the Philadelphia Phillies in a weekend series.No, the Yankees have not yet commented on the viral video.No, similar incidents have happened before, including at games in Oakland and New York.",Couple caught in apparent s*x act at Yankee Stadium during a live game.

"Calgary Flames sign Martin Pospisil to three-year, $7.5M NHL contract extension",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/calgary-flames-sign-martin-pospisil-to-three-year-7-5m-nhl-contract-extension/articleshow/123005147.cms,"Image Via r/CalgaryFlames Reddit

Calgary Flames lock in Martin Pospisil with long-term contract after strong 2024–25 NHL season

Key Flames players still unsigned as Calgary prioritizes Martin Pospisil extension

FAQs:

1. When does Martin Pospisil’s new contract start?

2. What nationality is Martin Pospisil?

The Calgary Flames have signed forward Martin Pospisil to a three-year contract extension worth $7.5 million, his agent Dan Milstein confirmed. The deal carries an average annual value of $2.5 million and begins in the 2026–27 season. Pospisil, who was set to enter the final year of his previous contract, will now bypass restricted free agency next summer, keeping him under Calgary’s control through the 2028–29 season.The 25-year-old Slovak forward played a key role for the Flames throughout the 2024–25 season, recording 25 points (4 goals, 21 assists) in 81 games while finishing third in the NHL with 301 hits. His physical edge remained intact, but Pospisil showed marked improvement in his discipline, cutting his penalty minutes from 109 in his rookie campaign to 84.He averaged 13:48 of ice time per game, earning brief power-play minutes in a net-front role and also seeing expanded usage at center. Pospisil won 40.8% of his 174 faceoffs, respectable for a player transitioning from the wing. With little change expected in the Flames’ forward group heading into the 2025–26 season, he’s projected to continue in a similar bottom-six role as his current $1 million cap hit remains in effect for one more year.While Pospisil’s new deal reflects his value as a reliable, energy-driven forward, the timing of the extension has raised eyebrows. Restricted free agent Connor Zary remains unsigned for the upcoming season, and other key names, center Mikael Backlund, defenseman Rasmus Andersson, and goalie Dustin Wolf will all need new deals for 2026–27.Andersson, in particular, could be a trade candidate if no progress is made, while Wolf’s future looms large given his rising profile as a potential starting goaltender. Even so, locking in Pospisil signals Calgary’s intent to preserve roster continuity and reward players who bring consistent effort and edge.The Flames have made a clear vote of confidence in Martin Pospisil, securing him for the long term after back-to-back impactful seasons. With other major contract decisions ahead, Calgary’s front office is banking on internal development and Pospisil’s evolving game to keep the franchise competitive.The extension begins in the 2026–27 NHL season.He is Slovakian.Also Read: NHL trade rumors: Nazem Kadri could join Montreal Canadiens after Toronto Maple Leafs blocked by Calgary Flames","The Calgary Flames have signed forward Martin Pospisil to a three-year contract extension.

Minnesota Wild winger Matt Boldy received for contract value by league-wide review



Why Are the Colorado Avalanche and Minnesota Wild Both Having Quiet Off-Seasons?

Matt Boldy's contract extension provides Minnesota Wild with a unique victory in cap management



A welcome victory for the Minnesota Wild front office



Minnesota Wild forward Matt Boldy isn't going to headline daily news, but his seven-year contract with the franchise has now received national attention for all the good reasons. In a recent breakdown by The Athletic's Dom Luszczyszyn, 23-year-old forward Boldy was included in the NHL's top ten contracts—a shocking but deserved recognition for the Wild front office.Dom Luszczyszyn graded player contracts on a combination of recent performance, long-term worth, and the extent to which players were exceeding their salary cap hits. At ninth on the list, Matt Boldy's contract—inked in January 2023 for $49 million over seven years—was an example of brilliant forward-looking roster construction. The Minnesota Wild has a gifted two-way winger under contract through the 2029-30 season, solidly in his athletic prime.Unlike numerous top NHL performers on the cusp of their prime, Matt Boldy has a contract for a salary that greatly falls below his market value. The average $7 million annual deal appears even better in contrast to such newer signings as the Anaheim Ducks' pact with elder Mikael Granlund for the same sum.Though experienced, Granlund does not carry the same potential or level of youthfulness that Boldy possesses.If Matt Boldy were to reach unrestricted free agency today, it's generally felt he would be able to secure a contract in the high eight-figure per-year range. That scenario highlights just how great a deal his existing contract is for the Minnesota Wild, who've signed a prospective All-Star to a long-term contract at a bargain.The worth Matt Boldy provides is more than points.

The Flagg Family Blueprint: How Love, Honesty, and Intentionality Built a Generational Talent

Whenwas selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, the basketball world took notice—not just of his elite talent, but of the journey that brought him from a small town in Maine to the sport’s biggest stage. While much of the spotlight now shines on Cooper, his rise can’t be fully understood without recognizing the unwavering influence of his mother, Kelly Flagg. Her unique blend of athletic background, honest parenting, individualized focus, and humor became the foundation for a household built on grit, love, and excellence.Cooper Flagg’s path to stardom didn’t begin on hardwood at Duke or in front of NBA scouts—it started in a gym that felt more like home. Kelly Flagg (née Bowman) wasn’t just a supportive parent; she was a former star herself. At the University of Maine, she led her team to its first-ever NCAA tournament win in 1999 and later earned a spot in the school’s Sports Hall of Fame. Cooper’s father, Ralph, also played college basketball, making the sport a family affair.Their three children—Hunter, Ace, and Cooper—grew up immersed in the game. Basketball wasn’t a hobby; it was woven into their everyday lives.Late-night shooting drills, family court battles, and dinner conversations all revolved around hoops. “I dreamt that my kids would be great basketball players,” Kelly once said with a laugh. “That’s why I married your dad—he was tall. I thought I could get some tall basketball babies. ”But Kelly’s parenting approach wasn’t just about basketball. She believed in raising each of her kids as distinct individuals, tailoring her support to fit their personalities and needs. “I’ve always been intentional about parenting them as individuals,” she explained. “Even though they’re both competitive, their mindsets and approaches are different. So we adjusted how we raised them accordingly.”As both a coach and a mom, Kelly knew when to give tactical advice and when to offer emotional support. Game nights were emotionally taxing—she often felt like she had played every minute alongside Cooper.A central trait that defines Cooper Flagg is his insatiable competitiveness—a fire Kelly helped ignite and stoke from an early age. In the Flagg household, everything was a challenge. “He doesn’t accept anything less than being the best,” Kelly said. “Whether it’s basketball or something small, he wants to dominate.”But it wasn’t just about winning. Kelly also grounded her children in realism and accountability. “I’ve never sugarcoated anything,” she admitted. “If their effort wasn’t there, I’d tell them. I think being honest has helped them.”Her straightforwardness paid off. Cooper embraced the grind—working on fundamentals, staying late in the gym, and mastering the details, especially free throws. “They’re called free for a reason,” Kelly would say, emphasizing the value of focus and repetition.As Cooper’s fame grew, so did the pressure—but Kelly made sure the family stayed rooted. Rituals like sitting in the same seat for games or sticking to quirky superstitions kept things lighthearted and familiar. She never lost her sense of humor, often joking about marrying for basketball genetics or poking fun at Cooper’s rising status.More than anything, she maintained a strong emotional presence. No matter how high Cooper climbed, the Flagg family made it a priority to support one another—on the court and beyond.Kelly Flagg never claimed to have a magic recipe for raising a superstar. But through her actions, she revealed a powerful truth: greatness is born at the intersection of genetics, intention, honesty, competition, and love. Her commitment to understanding her children as individuals, challenging them to work harder, and being there every step of the way created more than just a basketball star—it built a resilient, grounded young man ready for anything.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Dallas Mavericks Weigh Risky but Ambitious Move for $52.6 Million Los Angeles Lakers Legend to form Big 3 with Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving Cooper Flagg’s journey may be his own, but it’s one deeply rooted in a family culture that values authenticity, grit, and joy. And in that culture, Kelly Flagg isn’t just a mom—she’s the architect.","Cooper Flagg was selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft.

Edmonton Oilers face uncertainty as Connor McDavid eyes short-term NHL contract extension at potential record salary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/edmonton-oilers-face-uncertainty-as-connor-mcdavid-eyes-short-term-nhl-contract-extension-at-potential-record-salary/articleshow/123005572.cms,"Perry Nelson/USA TODAY Sports

Connor McDavid’s next NHL contract may set salary record but raises concerns over short-term deal

Edmonton Oilers eager to lock in Connor McDavid with contract extension amid uncertain NHL future

FAQs:

1. What kind of contract is McDavid considering next?

2. Who is Connor McDavid?

As Connor McDavid enters the final year of his current contract, the Edmonton Oilers are facing growing uncertainty about their franchise star’s future. McDavid, widely regarded as the best player in the world, is reportedly considering a short-term extension rather than the maximum eight-year deal the Oilers would prefer. Speculation suggests his next contract could carry an AAV between $16–17.5 million, potentially the highest in NHL history.According to NHL insider Frank Seravalli, McDavid is leaning toward a shorter contract, possibly around four years, rather than committing to a full eight-year extension. While no final decision has been made, Seravalli estimates McDavid’s next deal could fall in the $16–17.5 million AAV range, which would eclipse Leon Draisaitl’s current league-leading $14 million AAV.For Edmonton, that presents a tough balancing act. A shorter deal gives McDavid flexibility to reassess the team’s direction in a few years, while the Oilers risk losing him sooner if their Stanley Cup window doesn’t materialize. Still, from a player standpoint, a shorter term at a record-setting salary offers McDavid both maximum earnings and full control over his future.McDavid’s current eight-year, $12.5 million AAV contract signed in 2017, expires at the end of the 2025–26 season.The Oilers are hoping to avoid any risk of him reaching unrestricted free agency next July, making this extension their top priority. While they’d ideally secure him long-term through 2034, the franchise may have to settle for a compromise to ensure he stays.Seravalli notes that even an eight-year deal wouldn't necessarily guarantee McDavid’s long-term stay, given his immense leverage. If Edmonton fails to stay competitive, McDavid could still request a trade down the line. His influence within the organization is unmatched, making the structure of his next deal less about commitment and more about flexibility.Connor McDavid’s contract talks have put the spotlight back on Edmonton’s long-term trajectory. While the Oilers remain committed to keeping their superstar, the possibility of a shorter, high-value deal introduces new pressure on the franchise. Whether McDavid signs for four or eight years, one thing is clear: he’s set to redefine the NHL’s salary landscape.Reports suggest he may sign a shorter-term deal, possibly around four years.He’s the captain of the Edmonton Oilers and one of the best players in the NHL.Also Read: Calgary Flames sign Martin Pospisil to three-year, $7.5M NHL contract extension","Connor McDavid is in the final year of his current contract with the Edmonton Oilers.

NEW DELHI: India and England are set to lock horns in the fifth and final Test of the series at the Kennington Oval in London, starting Thursday. With England leading 2-1, India have one last opportunity to draw level and avoid a series defeat.After an up-and-down performance in Manchester, India face a few key selection decisions. While the batting lineup staged a commendable recovery, the bowling unit looked below par. Debutant Anshul Kamboj struggled with pace and control, and the rest of the bowlers failed to maintain consistent pressure.As the team looks to shore up its bowling attack, changes appear likely. With Rishabh Pant sidelined due to injury, Dhruv Jurel is expected to make a straightforward return to the playing XI as wicketkeeper.England, on the other hand, will be disappointed not to have sealed the series in Manchester despite being in control for large portions of the match. One of their main concerns heading into the final Test is managing the workload of their fast bowlers. Both Brydon Carse and Chris Woakes have featured in all four Tests, and with rotation in mind, England are expected to freshen up their pace attack.Adding to England’s challenge is the absence of skipper Ben Stokes, who has been ruled out due to a shoulder injury.Ollie Pope will take over the captaincy, and England have confirmed four changes to their XI.Announced on Wednesday, the revamped England lineup sees the inclusion of Jacob Bethell, Gus Atkinson, Jamie Overton, and Josh Tongue.Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill (c), Dhruv Jurel (wk), Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Akash Deep, Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep SinghZak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope (c), Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jacob Bethell, Jamie Smith (wk), Chris Woakes, Gus Atkinson, Jamie Overton, Josh TongueThe fifth and final Test of the series will begin on July 31.The match will be held at The Oval Stadium in London.Live action from the fifth Test will begin at 3:30 PM IST.The toss between India’s Shubman Gill and England’s stand-in captain Ollie Pope will take place at 3:00 PM IST.The Sony Sports Network will broadcast the match live in India.",The fifth and final Test of the series will begin on July 31.

Poll Which team do you think has the advantage in overcast conditions? India England Both have an equal chance.

With England leading the series 2-1, Shubman Gill’s India must win to level it 2-2 and share the trophy. However, as India prepare for the 5th Test at The Oval in London, all eyes are not just on the pitch and players, but on the skies.Looming over the highly anticipated contest is an unpredictable London weather forecast.According to the latest London weather update, rain could play spoilsport across all five days of the IND vs ENG 5th Test Match.The Oval weather report indicates cloudy skies with light rain expected daily.Temperatures are set to hover between 14°C and 24°C, with high humidity (around 88%) and wind speeds up to 13 km/h.These overcast conditions could heavily favour the swing bowlers, adding a new layer of complexity to the game.India comes into this clash riding a wave of momentum after an epic fightback in Manchester, where special centuries from Shubman Gill, Ravindra Jadeja, and Washington Sundar, along with KL Rahul’s gritty 90, helped secure a dramatic draw.However, injuries are a concern. Jasprit Bumrah is likely to be rested, with Arshdeep Singh or Akash Deep expected to debut.For England, Ben Stokes is out due to a biceps tendon injury, and Ollie Pope will captain the side.Adding to the drama is the tension over the pitch itself. The Oval pitch appears green, favouring seamers, though some grass may be trimmed before play. Since 2019, all four innings here have averaged under 300 runs, pointing to bowler-friendly conditions.If the rain holds off, fans are in for a cracking match. But with the London weather forecast looking grim, the India vs England weather update might prove just as important as the toss. Fingers crossed that the rain stays away from this thrilling series finale.","England vs India 5th Test at The Oval, London. England leading the series 2-1.

Goenka highlighted that Huang’s career journey included being a dishwasher and he eventually became a tech visionary. Before starting Nvidia in 1993, Huang worked as a dishwasher, busboy, and waiter at Denny's, a popular American diner chain.

From dishwasher at Denny’s…to Founder & CEO of NVIDIA. Take a bow, Jensen Huang.”Goenka’s post quickly went viral and many users admired the hard work put in by Jensen Huang to reach a position of a CEO of the multi-trillion dollar company. Many users also praised his simplicity and honest as he chose to include the jobs in his LinkedIn profile.“I was the best dishwasher Denny’s ever had,” Huang once said in an interview. “Eventually I got promoted to busboy.” This period, often glossed over in tech success stories, was pivotal for Huang. It taught him not only resilience but the dignity of labor, time management, and perseverance. “I learned a lot during that time—how to work hard, how to show up on time, and how to treat every task with seriousness.”Recently, Goenka also praised Jeff Bezos by sharing a video clip of the Amazon founder on X. In the clip, Bezos says a CEO must do three things: identify big ideas, enforce tough execution, and nurture future leaders.“Role of CEOs… very succinctly put by Jeff Bezos,” Goenka captioned the post on X.The video, originally from the Dealbook Summit, shows Bezos emphasizing that his current focus is on ensuring the success of Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and the broader leadership team.",Billionaire Harsh Goenka has praised Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in his latest social media post.

Edmonton Oilers fans are feeling the weight of the offseason as Connor McDavid remains unsigned for a new contract. The Oilers’ captain, currently in the final year of his eight-year, $100 million deal, has been eligible to sign an extension since July 1, yet no agreement has been reached. This delay is sparking speculation and fueling anxiety among fans about the franchise’s future.Oilers General Manager Stan Bowman recently addressed McDavid’s contract status on Bob Stauffer’s “Oilers Now” podcast, sharing a patient approach to the negotiations. Bowman confirmed that he has spoken to McDavid’s agent, Judd Moldaver, but emphasized that the team is giving the superstar his space to decide his future.“Honestly, I’ve tried to give Connor his space,” Stan Bowman said. A lot of this is respecting the athlete and their timeline. So we haven't had any of those types of detailed discussions yet, but we certainly will.

FAQs

1. How much ownership does Tom Brady have in the Raiders?

2. Is Tom Brady involved in Raiders player signings or coaching?

Tom Brady’s minority stake in the Las Vegas Raiders has sparked ongoing rumors about how involved he really is. Many NFL fans believe the former quarterback still pulls strings behind the scenes. His status as a football icon only adds to the suspicion. But Brady is now speaking up—clearly and candidly—about his true role with the team.There’s been a long-running belief that Brady holds quiet power in the Raiders’ front office, but he says that couldn’t be further from the truth. “I think people assume I have more influence than I really do,” he told Front Office Sports. While he does own a five percent stake, it comes without control over roster decisions or coaching calls.“I’m not involved in daily decisions or who’s getting signed,” he explained. His involvement is not about managing contracts, trades, or strategy meetings. That’s left to the official team executives. Brady wants fans to know—he’s not pulling strings behind closed doors.Brady explained that his current role is more about guiding and inspiring than managing. “I feel like I can play a role from 30,000 feet to make sure the players are saying the right thing, the coaches are saying the right thing,” he said.His interest lies in the culture, not in the paperwork.“And I really enjoy that role, and I can play a mentorship role in different ways in a lot of different areas,” he added. It’s not about spotlight or power for him anymore. He finds meaning in uplifting others. That mindset marks a quiet evolution from superstar athlete to off-field leader.Even as a minority owner, Brady said he wants to be part of shaping a winning, respectful environment. “I enjoy the process and the product that happens on the field,” he said, showing his continued emotional tie to the game. But he doesn’t want to interfere with those in the driver’s seat.“There’s certainly business people involved in selling tickets and sponsorships and so forth,” he noted. His goal isn’t to cross into business or sideline authority. Instead, he chooses to watch, encourage, and nudge from a respectful distance. That’s where he feels he can now make the biggest difference.Even as he steps back from the front lines, Brady’s presence is still felt in quieter, lasting ways. He’s no longer drawing up plays or reading defenses—but he’s helping shape a mindset, a standard. From throwing touchdowns to guiding from above, Brady is still in the game—just playing it from a different field now. And for a legend who once thrived under pressure, this quieter chapter may be his most meaningful yet.Also read: “This is tough”: Miami Dolphins CB Kader Kohou out for 2025 NFL season with knee injury, leaving secondary in crisis He holds a five percent minority stake in the franchise, which gives him no control over team operations.No. Brady confirmed he has no say in staff decisions, trades, or roster changes.","Tom Brady clears the air on rumors of controlling the Las Vegas Raiders' inner workings.

The Super Bowl winner, as in sync with his accomplishments on the scoreboard, racked up a financial empire worth $165 million. But what made him stand out among all the other millionaires is that he’s actively benefiting society. Wilson, over the years, has been committed to uplifting his community through a non-profit organisation,The foundation works for the underprivileged children, helping them to achieve better health, better education, and overall well-being. But it’s not just him engaging with this bigger cause and trying to bring a change in society; Ciara, Wilson’s better half, has been another pillar of his foundation since its inception. The power couple just launched the second youth center of this NGO last Tuesday, and guess who couldn’t be happier! The Grammy-winning singer was elated, announcing their latest feat via an IG post that reads:They are, certainly. They are doing their duties beyond the huge stardom and the constant flashes of lights, camera, and action.","Russell Wilson's wife, Ciara, paid him a surprise visit and had some quality time with the kids.
