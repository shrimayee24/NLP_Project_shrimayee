‘Don’t let Rambo die alone like Shankar’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-let-rambo-die-alone-like-shankar/articleshow/124017909.cms,"When 20-year-old Nikita Dhawan heard of Shankar’s death on Wednesday, it felt as if she had lost a close family member. For years, she had fought for the rescue of Delhi’s only African elephant, kept in solitary confinement at the city zoo. Now, she hopes Shankar’s passing will prevent a similar fate for Rambo, the only remaining African elephant in captivity at Mysuru Zoo.Dhawan first saw Shankar four years ago on a trip to Delhi Zoo with her parents, and felt something shift inside her. The elephant, one of two brought to India in 1998 as a diplomatic gift from Zimbabwe, stood alone, his feet bound with metallic chains. His companion had died in 2001, and since then, the elephant named after former Indian president Shankar Dayal Sharma lived in isolation — a cruel fate for a species known for their social nature and desire for companionship.“At that time, he was chained for 17 hours a day. He was also in the proximity of trains, which was very harmful to his ears. He was showing a lot of stressful behaviour,” she says.Dhawan, whose love for wildlife stemmed from the many trips she made with her parents to sanctuaries, decided to channel her heartbreak into action. She started a non-profit called Youth for Animals to mobilise support and help Shankar get out of the zoo.Soon, other young volunteers joined, filed RTIs and sent letters to the Delhi Zoo and the Prime Minister. They also gathered video evidence of his physical and mental state. In 2022, they officially filed a public interest litigation in Delhi high court. “An inspection report for Shankar was ordered, but it was not done by an independent third-party. So, we didn’t feel like the results accurately reflected his condition,” Dhawan says. It was decided that Shankar would be kept at the zoo. Then, in March 2023, the Supreme Court increased the jurisdiction and powers of a high-powered committee led by Justice (retd) Deepak Verma, to conduct necessary checks and fact-finding exercises concerning wild animals, including those in captivity, across India. That brought hope to Dhawan, and she focused on getting transfer options ready for Shankar. “We knew something had to be done urgently. Elephants are very social animals, and you can’t just rip them out of the wild and make them live on their own. For nearly 13 years, Shankar had no visual or oral communication, even with the other Asian elephants at the zoo,” says Dhawan.UK-based Aspinall Foundation, which runs multiple sanctuaries across Africa, agreed to shift the lonely elephant, and take care of the expenses too. However, the domestic authorities wanted to keep Shankar in India, Dhawan says. Hence, the search for a domestic alternative began. Last summer, she visited Vantara, the animal rescue arm of Reliance Foundation in Jamnagar, which expressed interest in housing Shankar alongside other African elephants. “We sent that option to the high-powered committee, but received no response,” she says.Meanwhile, pressure began to mount on the Delhi zoo authorities. In Oct 2024, the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums suspended its license over concerns about Shankar’s living conditions. The body asked the authorities to either improve the conditions or relocate him. However, before that could happen, Shankar passed away at the age of 29, years before the species’ average life expectancy of 70. An inquiry has been ordered into the cause of the death, while zoo officials claim that Shankar showed no signs of illness and the collapse was sudden. “I feel that the zoo had the option and the funding to make a better life for Shankar, but they chose not to take it. I do believe his death was preventable,” Dhawan emphasises.Currently studying at Stanford University, she hopes that the death will urge more Indian youngsters to speak up against the exploitation of animals for public entertainment. Her focus is now Rambo, the African elephant in Mysuru who has been alone since 2016 following the death of his father. “I really hope that Shankar’s death highlights the need to save Rambo before it’s too late.”","Shankar, Delhi's only African elephant, died on Wednesday at the age of 29.

Who is Chelsea Wolfe: Past controversies, clashes with US cycling and Olympic journey

Chelsea Wolfe, a transgender BMX freestyle rider from Florida, is facing huge backlash after celebrating the murder of Charlie Kirk. On September 10, 2025, Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old conservative activist, was shot and killed while giving a speech at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. Soon after the news broke, Chelsea Wolfe, who was an alternate rider for Team USA at the Tokyo 2021 Olympics, shared several Instagram stories. One post showed a USA Today headline on Kirk’s death with a cartoon image of Dora the Explorer and the words, “We did it!” She also shared a selfie giving a thumbs up and called Kirk a “Nazi.”Chelsea Wolfe’s reaction shocked many across the country. In one post, she wrote:In another story, she compared Kirk again to a Nazi, saying:The posts drew swift attention. Sports figures, activists, and fans called her words “sickening” and “violent.” USA Cycling released a statement on September 12, 2025, making clear that Wolfe no longer represents them.Jennifer Sey, founder of XX-XY Athletics, told the Daily Mail it was not surprising to see Wolfe celebrate Kirk’s assassination.She said Wolfe has a long history of calling opponents “Nazis” and pushing dangerous rhetoric.Chelsea Wolfe, born May 5, 1993, in Lake Park, Florida, started BMX at the age of six and later transitioned as a teenager. She made history in June 2021 by qualifying as the first openly transgender athlete for Team USA at the Tokyo Olympics, where she was listed as an alternate in women’s BMX freestyle.But Wolfe has long courted controversy. Back in 2021, she wrote on Facebook: “My goal is to win the Olympics so I can burn a US flag on the podium.” In interviews with Fox News, she later said she did not hate the country but wanted to stand against “fascism.”Also Read: Andre Agassi And Steffi Graf’s Son Jaden Agassi Shares Unseen Photos With Catherine Holt As Couple Celebrates Love Her BMX career ended in July 2023 when the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) banned transgender women from competing in women’s events.Chelsea Wolfe admitted the rule change left her heartbroken and said she was on “suicide watch” during that time.

Jordon Hudson’s presence at UNC games



Bill Belichick faces rocky start with Jordon Hudson by his side



Bill Belichick’s transition to college football has been anything but smooth, and on Saturday, it was his girlfriend Jordon Hudson who once again drew attention. Dressed in a striking blue snake-print miniskirt, knee-high boots, and a white off-the-shoulder top, Hudson was spotted cheering for the coach before North Carolina’s 34-9 loss to UCF. Later, she was seen in the tunnel giving Belichick a pep talk after the deflating defeat.Hudson has been impossible to miss since the season began. From sparkly Tar Heels-blue pants at the opener to her headline-making sideline appearances, she has become a consistent talking point in Chapel Hill. The former cheerleader and beauty queen is also no stranger to going viral. Earlier this year, she made waves online when she balanced on Belichick’s hands and feet during a yoga stunt on spring break.On Saturday, however, her role seemed more personal than performative. As the 73-year-old coach walked off the field with his head down, Hudson was waiting to lift his spirits. Her visible support has many wondering if her presence has become a bigger story than the Tar Heels’ struggles on the field.Belichick’s first college season after six Super Bowl titles with the New England Patriots has started on shaky ground.The Tar Heels have yet to find their rhythm, and critics say it could be a long season ahead. Still, Hudson appears ready to stand by him through every high and low.UNC confirmed her involvement beyond the sidelines as well. ""Jordon will continue to manage all activities related to Coach Belichick’s personal brand outside of his responsibilities for Carolina Football and the University,"" the school said.With Clemson up next after a bye week, all eyes will again be on Belichick—and just as likely, on Hudson.

This raises concerns about career risks versus global sport promotion.

NFL warns players of consequences without league backing

Star power adds intrigue, but risks loom large

The NFL has sent a clear message to its players: think twice before stepping onto the field for Tom Brady’s upcoming flag football showcase in Saudi Arabia. Despite the excitement surrounding the March 2026 event, the league is distancing itself from the exhibition, warning players that participation carries risks outside official protections.According to a memo circulated to all 32 teams, the NFL emphasized that it “will not be part of Saudi exhibition game” and reminded organizations that player involvement requires written approval. The league clarified, “This Event is not an NFL-sanctioned event, and the league has no role in the organization or production of the game.”More critically, the statement highlighted that “any injury sustained while participating in the Event will be considered a Non-Football Injury.” In plain terms, this means no salary protection, no insurance coverage, and no team responsibility if a star player gets hurt while competing. For athletes whose livelihoods depend on their health, that’s a high-stakes gamble.Still, the roster Brady has assembled is hard to ignore. Saquon Barkley, Christian McCaffrey, CeeDee Lamb, Maxx Crosby, Sauce Gardner, Myles Garrett, George Kittle, Fred Warner, and Rob Gronkowski are among the headliners expected to play.The event mirrors the Olympic-style format set to debut at the 2028 Los Angeles Games, adding to its prestige and appeal.For many players, the Saudi tournament represents more than an exhibition—it’s a chance to grow the sport globally and share the field with icons in a lighter, faster-paced version of football. Yet the NFL’s firm stance introduces a sobering reality: athletes may have to weigh personal ambition against career security.Also Read: Controversial Josh Allen kneeldown sparks Dolphins–NFL discussions, Mike McDaniel believes ball was fumbled With Brady and Gronk bringing their star power back into the spotlight, fans are eager to see history in the making.

She wore a chic denim minidress with a slim belt, matching heels, and a black handbag, while Patrick, also 30, kept it bold in a striped Louis Vuitton shirt, dark pants, and sneakers. The outing gave the couple a rare evening away from their three children — Sterling, 4, Bronze, 2, and Golden, just 8 months old.The evening held extra meaning, as the steakhouse had officially opened its doors on Sept. 17, aligning with Patrick’s 30th birthday. Days earlier, the couple had already marked the milestone with friends after the Chiefs’ home game. Guests included country star Kane Brown, his wife Katelyn, Travis Kelce, and Taylor Swift , who all posed together inside the elegant space.Brittany shared a heartfelt tribute to her husband on Instagram, writing, “Happy 30th Birthday!!! You are so special to us, and we love you to forever and beyond!” She added, “The way you love us is so comforting, and the way you go about life is just so inspiring! Keep being YOU 🤍.”The steakhouse isn’t just another upscale eatery. Its name pays homage to Mahomes’ and Kelce’s jersey numbers, 15 and 87. The menu highlights classic favorites, including steaks, lobster tails, wild king salmon, and chicken parmesan, while the cocktail list adds a playful twist. Drinks like “Showtime” and “The Big Yeti” nod to the star athletes’ nicknames, while “Queen B” and “Alchemy” give a toast to Brittany and Taylor Swift.With its blend of fine dining, celebrity buzz, and personal touches, 1587 Prime has already become more than a restaurant.

Cubs’ closer situation in 2025

Why Ryan Helsley is being linked to Chicago

The gamble vs reward involved in this trade for the Cubs

Here’s a quick breakdown of the situation:

Aspect Pros Cons Cubs’ bullpen need



Helsley could fill in immediately with Palencia sidelined



Risk if Palencia cannot return and Helsley also struggles



Helsley’s profile



Proven velocity and dominance before trade



Performance fell sharply with Mets



Financial side



Lowered price tag after poor Mets stint



Still requires multiyear commitment





Themay be forced to take a bold approach in fixing their bullpen this winter. With injuries and underperformance leaving their closer situation in flux, Sports Illustrated’s Zach Pressnell suggests the team could take a chance on, a once-dominant reliever whose stock has dropped following a disappointing stint with the New York Mets.The Cubs entered the season with Ryan Pressly as their designated closer after signing him over the winter. However, Pressly’s struggles quickly led to a change. Daniel Palencia stepped in and thrived in the role, becoming a steady presence at the back of the bullpen.• Palencia appeared in 52 games this year• He posted a 3.00 ERA across 51 innings• He converted 22 saves before suffering a right shoulder strainPalencia is now on the 15-day injured list, and his postseason availability remains uncertain. This setback leaves the Cubs with a significant hole in their bullpen as they prepare for potential October baseball.The Mets acquired Ryan Helsley at the trade deadline in an effort to boost their relief corps. But his performance took a nosedive after joining New York. While he pitched effectively in the first half of the season, his struggles in a Mets uniform have diminished his free-agent value heading into the offseason.Pressnell believes this is where the Cubs could pounce: “Helsley was dominant in the first half, but fell off when he joined the Mets. His price tag is likely a bit lower now than it was a few months ago, though his talent is still there. The Cubs could target him on a four-year deal to make the flamethrower the closer of the future in the Windy City.” – Zach Pressnell, Sports IllustratedIf the Cubs pursue Helsley, it will be a calculated risk. His struggles in New York have raised questions, but his track record shows he has the talent to dominate when healthy and confident.The Cubs are expected to target bullpen help this winter regardless of Palencia’s health status. Helsley represents a high-risk, high-reward option. If he returns to his pre-trade form, he could become one of the biggest steals of the offseason and stabilize the closer role in Chicago for years.Also read: MLB Trade Rumors: Detroit Tigers Reportedly Eyeing $120 Million Boston Red Sox All-Star in Aggressive Free Agency Pursuit The coming months will determine if the Cubs are willing to take that gamble and make Helsley a key piece of their future bullpen plans.","The New York Mets acquired Ryan Helsley at the trade deadline in an effort to boost their relief corps.

Pakistan:

Skipper Suryakumar Yadav will depend heavily on his spin troika as India gear up for another intense and tense Super 4 face-off against Pakistan in the Asia Cup 2025 on Sunday. The stakes are high, not just because of the rivalry, but also due to lingering tension from last Sunday’s match, when India’s players opted not to shake hands with their rivals — a move that has dominated headlines and added an unusual edge to the contest.India’s lineup appears well-balanced, with Suryakumar expected to anchor the innings, while Jasprit Bumrah and Varun Chakravarthy return to the playing XI after being rested in the previous inconsequential game. Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, and Varun Chakravarthy will carry the responsibility of tilting the game in India’s favour with their spin, especially on the slow Dubai International Cricket Stadium surface. Fielding coach T Dilip has allayed concerns about Axar’s head injury, but in case he is unfit, replacements like Washington Sundar or Riyan Parag remain options.Pakistan, on the other hand, face a thin batting lineup. Opener Saim Ayub has struggled for form, while Shaheen Shah Afridi has been the standout performer. Fakhar Zaman remains Pakistan’s most reliable batter, but their middle order continues to appear fragile.Fast bowler Haris Rauf may return after a strong showing against the UAE. The contest promises high tension both on and off the field, with India likely to stick to their handshakes policy amid the ongoing narrative.21 September 20258 PMDubai International Cricket StadiumMatches will be broadcast on Sony Sports Network, with SonyLIV providing live streaming on app and website.Super Four matches, including India vs Pakistan, will be available on Willow TV, starting at 10:30 AM EST.Viewers can watch via Sky Sports Cricket, Sky Sports Main Event, and Sky Sports Ultra HDR, with coverage starting at 3:00 PM BST and match kick-off at 3:30 PM BST.

Kirk Herbstreit learns about close friend Brett James’ tragic death during live ‘TNF’ broadcast



Community reacts to tragic loss



Football fans and music lovers alike were shaken Thursday night when ESPN and Amazon Prime announcer Kirk Herbstreit learned that his close friend, Grammy-winning songwriter Brett James, had died in a plane crash. The news came while Herbstreit was calling the Bills’ 31-21 victory over the Dolphins, leaving him and many others in shock. James, 57, along with his girlfriend, Melody Wilson, 59, and her daughter, Meryl Maxwell Wilson, 28, were killed when their single-engine Cirrus SR22T crashed in Franklin, North Carolina.James’ songwriting career left an indelible mark on country music. He penned Carrie Underwood’s Grammy-winning hit “Jesus, Take the Wheel” and contributed to Taylor Swift’s early success with “A Perfectly Good Heart,” among numerous other songs. Known for his talent and humility, James was a respected figure in Nashville’s music scene. His passing has left a profound void for both the music community and those who knew him personally.Herbstreit shared a heartfelt tribute on X, reflecting on their friendship. “Was calling a game [Thursday] night when I got the news on a text that Brett was in a plane crash and didn’t make it. Living in Nashville, I’ve been very fortunate to meet a lot of incredible people… Brett was certainly that – one of the most talented and yet humble and down to earth guys I’ve met,” he wrote.The two shared memorable moments together, including James performing at Herbstreit’s 50th birthday alongside fellow songwriter Casey Beathard. “He was a legend as a songwriter and one of the most respected people in that town. Just heartbreaking – my thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends as they cope with this unthinkable reality,” Herbstreit added.The plane crash has left country music fans and friends mourning the sudden loss of James and his loved ones. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed the plane was registered to James, though it remains unclear whether he was piloting at the time of the crash. The North Carolina State Highway Patrol confirmed there were no survivors.Herbstreit, 56, will continue his broadcast duties this weekend, joining ESPN’s “College GameDay” crew in Coral Gables, Florida, but he, along with countless others, will carry the weight of this personal loss. James’ legacy, however, lives on through the songs that touched millions and the memories he created with friends and fans alike.Also Read: Brock Purdy injury update: 49ers QB ‘highly unlikely’ to play vs. Cardinals which gives Mac Jones another chance under center","Kirk Herbstreit learned about close friend Brett James’ tragic death during live ‘TNF’ broadcast Thursday night.

Just then, a police officer asked her to step back as she approached Sims. This led to an exchange of words; however, moments later, Cunningham chose to back down.

“Go ahead and paint your nails” — Cam Newton slams Caleb Williams for letting style distract from winning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/go-ahead-and-paint-your-nails-cam-newton-slams-caleb-williams-for-letting-style-distract-from-winning/articleshow/124009585.cms,"Caleb Williams of the Chicago Bears warms up prior to the game against the Detroit Lions (Image Source - Getty Images)

Caleb Williams struggles in second NFL season with Chicago Bears

Cam Newton CALLS OUT Caleb Williams: ""Focus on WINNING, Not Nails""

Cam Newton urges Caleb Williams to focus on winning instead of media distractions

Another take from Cam Newton, the former NFL quarterback, was aimed at Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams. He pointed out that Williams is letting off-field distractions, like the talk about his painted nails, get in the way of his game focus. This was shared on Newton's podcast, where he highlighted that performance should take precedence over personal flair, particularly given the Bears' rough start to the season.Caleb Williams is recognized for his distinctive personal style, which includes painting his nails as a way to express himself. In April 2024, just before joining the league, Williams received criticism for this practice, with some doubting its appropriateness for a quarterback.During that period, Cam Newton came to Williams' defense on the ""Club Shay Shay"" podcast, saying, ""I guarantee if he paint his nails pink, and he go out there and ball, ain't nobody gonna say nothing about the pink,"". However, by September 2025, with Williams in his second NFL season and the Bears starting 0-2, Newton's tone shifted.The Bears' 2025 season started off rough with losses to their divisional foes: they fell to the Minnesota Vikings in Week 1 after leading in the first half but not being able to finish strong in the second.Then, in Week 2, they got crushed by the Detroit Lions in a 52-something blowout, as their defense struggled to contain the scoring.Williams' personal stats for these games show a passer rating under 90, a completion percentage of 61.5%, a passing success rate of 39.4%, and he has taken six sacks. The team, which finished with a 5-12 record in 2024, is now led by new head coach Ben Johnson. He has openly criticized the team's practice performance, pointing out that while problems like missed assignments can be corrected, they need improved focus.This shaky start has heightened the conversations surrounding Williams, particularly his style choices, sparking talks about whether these factors divert attention from his performance on the field. The criticism peaked in the episode of Newton's podcast ""4th&1 with Cam Newton"" titled ""Caleb Williams keeps going VIRAL for all the WRONG REASONS!"", released on YouTube on September 19, 2025, featuring guests Adam ""Pacman"" Jones and Reshad Jones.Newton was telling Williams to focus on winning instead of chatting with the media about stuff that isn't football. Newton, who used to be the MVP and quarterback for the Carolina Panthers, started his podcast ""4th&1"" to keep players accountable, as he mentioned in the episode, ""The reason why I created fourth and one is to hold everybody accountable."".Newton specifically told Williams, via the podcast, ""If that's what it takes for him to go out there and win football games, go ahead and paint your nails, my boy."" However, he added, ""Well, he's not winning. I think that's the problem. Why? If he was going out there and dominating, who gives a sh*t what color he's painting his nails, right?"" This illustrates Newton's perspective that quarterbacks should have to justify their unique traits with their performance, similar to how Tom Brady can get away with it because of his regular wins.Guest Adam ""Pacman"" Jones echoed this, saying, ""Any quarterback with nails on suck. ... I don't want my quarterback with no nails on your personal time."" Newton also suggested to Williams that he should ""pass on"" media chances regarding his nails, mentioning, ""Keep the main thing the main thing. And the main thing for you as a quarterback in your situation is winning. ... All that is all distractions if you're not winning. "" He warned that without wins, optics suffer: ""You’ve got a quarterback that’s worried about getting the French tip more than getting the ball over the goal line. ... The optics don’t look good.""Newton mentioned certain games, sharing with Williams, ""You played in a winnable first half versus the Minnesota Vikings. And where was all the execution and focus in the second half? You lost that game. Hey, you just played a division foe in the Detroit Lions. They put up a 52 Ray Lewis on you."" The term ""52 Ray Lewis"" probably refers to the Lions putting up 52 points, referencing the iconic jersey number of the legendary defender Ray Lewis to highlight the defensive effort.Also Read: “You should not be that gifted” — Colin Cowherd praises Buffalo Bills QB Josh Allen’s unstoppable 2025 form As the Bears gear up for Week 3 against the Dallas Cowboys, who have racked up 60 points in their first two games, the pressure is on to steer clear of an 0-3 start—this would be the second time since 2023. Williams' nail art, done for Week 1 by the same artist who worked with WNBA star Angel Reese, keeps sparking viral conversations, but Newton's point stands: winning on the field is what really matters.","Caleb Williams is recognized for his distinctive personal style, which includes painting his nails as a way to express himself.

India vs Oman in Asia Cup: Rinku takes STUNNING low catch; SKY sets stage on fire at nets

Poll Do you agree with Suryakumar Yadav's decision to not bat against Oman? Yes, it was a strategic move No, he should have batted Unsure about his reasoning

NEW DELHI: Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar defended India captain Suryakumar Yadav ’s controversial decision to not bat in the Asia Cup 2025 Group A clash against Oman, even after India lost eight wickets. The move sparked debate after India beat Oman by 21 runs at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Friday. Batting first, India posted 188/8, while Oman responded with a spirited 167/4.During a discussion on Sony Sports, Gavaskar explained his backing: “If he had batted for even one over, he could have hit a few fours and sixes and that would have been good for him. But the way he batted against Pakistan, maybe does not need batting practice. He may have thought that Kuldeep Yadav 's batting could come in handy if India lose quick wickets in one of the matches. Perhaps that's why he may have sent Kuldeep in to bat.”The 76-year-old former India captain added: “He is very unorthodox thinker. We saw in Sri Lanka that he himself bowled and also gave Rinku Singh the ball. He turned the game, which seemed to have slipped away, on its head and won India the match. He is an innovative thinker. Maybe that's why he did not bat and sent in Kuldeep and Arshdeep Singh.”While Sunil Gavaskar praised Surya’s tactical approach, his son and former India cricketer Rohan Gavaskar questioned the logic. He felt India missed an opportunity to rest Suryakumar while giving Rinku Singh a chance.“What doesn’t register with me is, if Suryakumar Yadav isn’t going to bat clearly because he’s sent Arshdeep, Harshit, and Kuldeep all ahead of him, then he might as well take a rest. Give Rinku a go. You’re not going to bat; you’re not going to contribute with the ball. If that’s the whole thought process, then let Rinku have a game,” Rohan told Cricbuzz.The debate around Surya’s unorthodox decision continues, but cricket experts like Sunil Gavaskar believe it reflects his innovative thinking and long-term strategy, signaling a captain willing to take bold risks for the bigger picture.",Sunil Gavaskar defends India captain Suryakumar Yadav's decision to not bat in the Asia Cup 2025 Group A clash against Oman.

Patrick Mahomes’ injury listing raises alarms for Chiefs fans

“Chiefs HC Andy Reid on Patrick Mahomes’ wrist injury, says it was something that happened during the Week 2 game,”

He had some swelling earlier in the week, but they managed to reduce it. He says that Mahomes practiced all week.”

Receiver Xavier Worthy’s availability still seems up in the air

We’ll see how it goes,”

The Kansas City Chiefs are walking on eggshells. One more loss and they will be far behind in the playoff push. The Patrick-Travis duo couldn’t flash much of their classics during the first two weeks. The rest of the lineup also looked extremely frail to eke that out. Social media went insane when the most popular duo indulged themselves in the lavish birthday bash of Mahomes right after the devastating 20-17 loss against the Philadelphia Eagles. Now, the 30-year-old quarterback seemed to be in deeper water as his wrist started to act up.Mahomes was listed on the injury report this week with his wrist issue‌, leaving the team and the fans in ‌severe jeopardy. Andy Reid can’t afford a consecutive third loss for the season. They are grinding very hard to bounce back against the New York Giants this Sunday. Losing their beating heart in the offense at this critical point would certainly be a blow that might derail them from the race in the long run.But Reid doesn’t really entertain those thoughts yet. He is rather hopeful that Mahomes will suit up even if he still has some complications to pay heed to.Charles Goldman of AtoZSports spilled in a report. “Through the first two games of the season, Mahomes racked up 58.8% of his passes for 445 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception. He added 123 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns on the ground. Mo debates on how crucial it is for him to lace up the shoes if the Chiefs want to clinch their first win of the season this week. But it’s not just Mahomes. The Chiefs have their star receiver Xavier Worthy on the shelf for an indefinite period.The 22-year-old Speedstar suffered a dislocated shoulder in the opening week. The mishap occurred during the Chiefs’ third offensive play. Worthy suddenly bumped into Travis and had to lean on his right arm after he managed to get up. He was taken out of the field immediately and hasn’t returned ever since. The NFL's official website updated that the star WR had an MRI, although his return timeline is still unclear.The young receiver returned to practice this week. That’s good news, but that doesn’t guarantee his availability in Week 3. When asked about it, coach Andy Reid escaped a clear cut answer. “Reid let the air of doubt prevail. The odds of his availability stands at a 50-50 stake as per the reports. If the Chiefs take any desperate step, it might backfire as shoulder injuries have the potential to keep him out for longer if rushed. But beyond all the strains, Reid must find a way to keep his offense tight. That’s non-negotiable for avoiding a rare week 3 heartbreak.",The Kansas City Chiefs are walking on eggshells.

NEW DELHI: Former Delhi captain Mithun Manhas has emerged as the front-runner to take charge as the new president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The 45-year-old, who never represented India at the international level, is set to make history as the first uncapped cricketer to head the country’s most powerful sporting body.The deadline for filing nominations closes on Sunday, with elections scheduled for September 28 at the BCCI’s Annual General Meeting (AGM). However, as has been the trend since the 2019 amendment to the BCCI constitution, the post is expected to be filled unopposed. In recent years, the board has consistently preferred former cricketers as presidents, with Sourav Ganguly and Roger Binny serving in the role before Manhas.Manhas brings with him both administrative and cricketing experience. He has been associated with the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) in an administrative role and has also represented the state at BCCI’s AGMs. On the field, he was regarded as one of the most dependable figures in Indian domestic cricket.Debuting in 1997/98, Manhas was a steady middle-order batsman for Delhi during an era dominated by legends like Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, VVS Laxman and Sourav Ganguly, which kept him away from India caps. Nevertheless, he led Delhi with distinction, guiding them to the Ranji Trophy title in 2007-08 and scoring 921 runs that season at an average of 57.56.A versatile cricketer, Manhas was primarily a right-handed batsman but also bowled off-spin and occasionally kept wickets. His career spanned 157 first-class matches, scoring 9,714 runs at 45.82 with 27 centuries and 49 fifties. He also featured in the IPL for Delhi Daredevils, Pune Warriors and Chennai Super Kings.With his mix of cricketing pedigree and administrative experience, Manhas now stands on the cusp of leading Indian cricket ’s governing body.","Mithun Manhas has emerged as the front-runner to take charge as the new president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) The 45-year-old, who never represented India at the international level, is set to make history as the first uncapped cricketer to head the country’s most powerful sporting body.

Poll Which aspect of Hardik Pandya's game do you find most impressive? Batting Bowling Fielding Overall athleticism

Exactly a week ago, on the eve of India's first match against Pakistan, Hardik Pandya was taking absolute stunners while practising with Team India fielding coach T Dilip at the ICC Cricket Academy.The India all-rounder missed a diving catch and immediately quipped: ""Agar main dive maar raha hoon iska matlab main theek se move nahi kar raha (If I am diving, it means I am not moving and anticipating quickly).""Pandya finished the session with a stunning running catch and got a bear hug from coach T Dilip.On Friday in Abu Dhabi, T Dilip was celebrating Pandya's running catch to dismiss Oman's Aamir Kaleem, who was looking to do the impossible. Kaleem flicked it to Pandya’s right, patrolling at fine leg. He moved rapidly, threw out his hands, and pulled off a blinder. He did very well to keep his balance too while running mere metres from the boundary rope.It was a catch that kept Oman at bay and saved India the humiliation.Former Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar compared Pandya with Faheem Ashraf, saying, ""They bowl at a similar pace. But the only difference is attitude.Hardik is in your face, while Faheem is timid.""Akhtar is partially true about Hardik, but Faheem Ashraf as an athlete is nowhere close to the Indian all-rounder. He cannot win Pakistan matches with the bat, ball, and in the field.Hardik was a pivotal cog in Virat Kohli's team across formats. With him in the XI, the term ""Kulcha"" was coined for the wrist-spin duo—Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal. His career-threatening injury broke that partnership, because without Pandya in the XI, only one of them could fit in.In Tests, he became India's fourth seamer — a luxury to have. It is saddening that a player of Pandya's calibre has only played 11 Tests, with his last appearance in 2018. India missed him dearly in the two World Test Championship (WTC) finals. He is the balance India need in overseas Tests.Former India strength and conditioning coach Soham Desai, who has seen Pandya closely, highlighted his workload.""Hardik is genetically and naturally very athletic. Very, very athletic. He has kept the benchmarks high. You won’t find such a guy who comes in the top 3 in sprint, explosiveness, and endurance. He is one of those guys,"" said Desai to TimesofIndia.com.""Obviously, with age, your body tends to slow down. But with his work ethic, hard work, and professionalism, he has maintained the benchmarks. His bowling load is equal to Siraj, Bumrah or Shami. In batting, it’s 60-70% of Virat Kohli’s workload—preparation-wise, not game load. So imagine the physical load he faces preparing for a series or tournament,"" he said.""That is why we need to address those cases differently,"" he added.Coming back to Pandya’s catch: could Pakistan’s Faheem Ashraf pluck those? Or is it only about attitude, as Akhtar suggested?Team India fielding coach T Dilip summed up Hardik's brilliance: ""The very important thing is preparation. Everybody has seen that. We were spot on with high catches and boundary line catches. But the most important factor was, at that moment, how well Hardik reacted. It is never easy, especially against a sweep when the ball is travelling. Catching technique, balancing with the ropes, and awareness made it fabulous. That is something we practised, and today he executed it under pressure,"" Dilip said in Abu Dhabi.He also subtly touched on Pandya’s workload management. ""Regarding workload, I think one thing we are very conscious of is communication—myself, bowling coach Morne Morkel, and Adrian (trainer). Whenever I push, someone else takes the back seat, and vice versa. In long camps, we focus on volume, but closer to tournaments, it’s all about specifics and intensity. With Hardik, his ability over time has been outstanding. It’s just about doing those little specifics,"" he said.Hardik may not be Kapil Dev, the one everyone thought he would emulate, but despite injuries and limited matches, he is the best India has got. There is a reason the management wraps him in cotton wool — they know his importance. So do former Pakistan cricketers and experts. On their shows, they talk more about Hardik than Bumrah, Kuldeep, or Suryakumar Yadav.Hardik Pandya is indeed the Indian cricketer Pakistan fears and admires the most in the current setup.","Hardik Pandya was a pivotal cog in Virat Kohli's team across formats.

Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has called India firm favourites to win their Super Four encounter against Pakistan in the ongoing Asia Cup. The two teams will be meeting again on Sunday after an eventful clash last week and the tension is expected to remain high when the players take the field at the Dubai International Stadium.""There is a lot of tension between India and Pakistan, and now it has reached the ground as well, which was not the case earlier,"" Rashid Latif told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.A lot is happening off the field too and Pakistan have cancelled their pre-match press-conference for the second time in a row. No one seems to know the exact reason but there has been no dearth of drama in the multi-nation event.""Don’t know what is happening,"" said Latif.The former Pakistan captain Latif feels that in T20Is anyone can win on their day but admits India are too strong.""In T20, anything can happen. Oman played very well yesterday. It's difficult to pick favourites in T20Is. In ODIs and Tests, you can say who is favourite and who is not. But in T20Is, you can’t. But if we look in hindsight, India is a strong team,"" he added.Latif credited India’s robust domestic set-up and the Indian Premier League (IPL) for the side's domination across formats.""The competition (IPL) Indian players play is of high quality. Pakistan plays in the PSL. There is a gulf of difference between IPL and PSL.""The difference between the two sides is also the experience. This Indian team is also a bit inexperienced with senior players like Rohit, Virat and Jadeja retiring. And even though they don’t have much experience, they have played some high-quality cricket,"" he said.Latif called Pakistan a weak team because of their fragile batting order and it has been evident with their poor starts. Opener Saim Ayub is yet to open his account in this tournament and has registered three ducks. Captain Salman Ali Agha has scored 0, 3, and 20 in their three outings.Sahibzada Farhan, picked for his aggressive batting, has looked all at sea. Pakistan are slowly sliding Hasan Nawaz down the order. Once an opener, he batted at No. 4, and is now coming in at 5 or 6. Hasan entered the Asia Cup as Pakistan’s most promising batter but is now being reduced to a lower-order role.""Pakistan looks like a weak team and everyone can see it. But you can’t write them off as well. It is 75-25 to India. India are favourites,"" Latif said.""You sometimes see one player not in form, but for Pakistan, the scenario is different. Saim Ayub is not in form, captain Salman Ali Agha is not in form, Mohammad Haris is struggling, Sahibzada Farhan is not looking in touch, Hasan Nawaz is struggling. If five of the top six batters are struggling, then it gets difficult,"" he added.Latif feels the only way Pakistan can beat India is if one of their batters has an exceptional day; otherwise, on paper, India looks a force to reckon with.""Only individual brilliance can help Pakistan win. Kisi ne kar diya toh kar diya (if someone has that kind of a day, then it’s fine). No doubt India is a very strong team and it will be difficult for Pakistan to register a win against India,"" he concluded.",Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif calls India firm favourites to win Super Four encounter against Pakistan in the ongoing Asia Cup.

Asia Cup: Handshake gate, Pakistan’s Super 4 entry and India vs Pakistan build-up

Poll Is it important for players to shake hands after a match? Yes, it promotes sportsmanship No, it's not necessary Depends on the situation

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Ravichandran Ashwin has come out strongly in defence of match referee Andy Pycroft while lashing out at Pakistan for “creating a needless spectacle” over the post-match handshake controversy that followed India’s group-stage win in the Asia Cup 2025.Speaking on his YouTube show Ash Ki Baat, Ashwin accused Pakistan of unfairly targeting Pycroft after demanding his removal from the tournament. “Andy Pycroft actually saved everybody from seeing such a poor spectacle,” Ashwin said. “India informed the match referee in advance — this is our decision, and we will follow it. That’s it. After all this drama, you lost the match. So what are you complaining about? You didn’t lose because we didn’t shake hands. Please go and find out what you can actually improve.”The International Cricket Council (ICC) has appointed Andy Pycroft as the match referee for the upcoming Asia Cup 2025 Super 4s clash between India and Pakistan at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday. This decision comes despite the Pakistan Cricket Board’s allegations regarding Pycroft’s conduct during the previous encounter on September 14. The ICC had rejected PCB’s demand to remove Pycroft, asserting that he did not breach the Code of Conduct in instructing Suryakumar Yadav and Agha Salman to avoid handshakes.Ashwin found the targeting of Pycroft baffling. “If no handshake was your problem with India, why were you looking for an answer to that problem in the UAE game? Why did you have to make Andy Pycroft the scapegoat? He has done nothing wrong.”Mocking suggestions that Pycroft should have forced the players to shake hands, Ashwin added, “He is not a schoolteacher. He’s not a principal. He can’t go and bring Surya and say, ‘Come shake hands’. That’s not his job. What exactly is Pycroft’s fault here?”The off-spinner clarified that India’s players were following an organisational directive. “Whether it’s a corporate office, a government firm, or a cricket team — when there’s an organisational directive, you follow it. Our players were clear: they were here to represent India, and they followed protocol. That’s our side of the story. The matter should end there.”Ashwin was particularly scathing about Pakistan’s demand for an apology. “You filed a complaint against India, and when the dust settles, you’re saying Pycroft apologised? If I were Andy Pycroft, you are apologising to me. What would I even be apologising for? ‘I’m sorry that Suryakumar Yadav didn’t shake your hand’? Really?”With India set to face Pakistan again in the Super Four stage on Sunday, Ashwin’s words underline India’s determination to keep the focus on cricket — not on distractions beyond the rope.","Former India cricketer Ravichandran Ashwin has come out strongly in defence of match referee Andy Pycroft.

The NFL legend’s $375 million contract is historic, yet the Brazilian supermodel’s global fashion empire continues to outpace his financial success.After retiring from his legendary 23-year NFL career, Brady signed a landmark 10-year, $375 million contract with Fox Sports to serve as the network’s lead NFL analyst. The deal, worth $37.5 million annually, makes him the highest-paid sports broadcaster in history, surpassing Tony Romo and Troy Aikman.On the field, Brady earned more than $333 million in NFL contracts and another $140 million from endorsements with brands like Under Armour, Aston Martin, Subway, and UGG. Altogether, his career earnings crossed $473 million before his first Fox broadcast.Despite Brady’s staggering success, Bündchen’s empire still keeps her ahead financially. The Brazilian supermodel, once the highest-paid model in the world for 14 straight years, reportedly continues to bring in around $40 million annually.Her career includes over $500 million in modeling contracts, high-profile endorsements, and ventures in wellness and sustainability. From magazine covers to walking in some of fashion’s most iconic shows, Bündchen’s brand has become bigger than the runway.Also Read: NFL issues warning: No protection for players joining Tom Brady’s Saudi flag football game While Brady’s broadcasting career could help close the gap, Bündchen’s diversified business model ensures her continued dominance. For all of Brady’s accolades—seven Super Bowl titles, three MVP awards, and now the richest broadcasting contract in sports—his ex-wife stands as proof that the fashion world, paired with smart investments, can rival even the biggest names in sports.","Gisele Bündchen’s enduring dominance in fashion and business keeps her ahead financially.

Judge sides with defense arguments centered on rehabilitation



Impact on Ricky Pearsall and wider NFL community

A California court has ruled that the teenager accused of shooting San Francisco 49ers rookie wide receiver Ricky Pearsall during an attempted robbery in 2024 will face trial as a juvenile, not an adult. The decision could drastically shape both the legal outcome and the broader debate on how violent crimes committed by minors should be prosecuted.The suspect, who was 17 at the time of the incident and is now 18, was charged with attempted murder, assault, and attempted robbery. Prosecutors argued the seriousness of the crime warranted an adult trial, but defense attorneys countered with a different perspective. They highlighted the teen’s history of childhood abuse and noted his record as a ""model prisoner"" during juvenile detention.Their case leaned heavily on the belief that rehabilitation, not long-term incarceration, would better serve both the suspect and society. After a weeklong hearing, the judge sided with the defense, ruling that the case will remain in juvenile court. If convicted, the teen could face detention and rehabilitative programs until adulthood, but he will not face the decades-long sentence possible under adult charges.Ricky Pearsall, a first-round pick for the 49ers in the 2024 NFL Draft, survived the shooting and has since returned to football activities. Still, the incident cast a shadow over the start of his professional career and sparked public debate.Also Read: NFL issues warning: No protection for players joining Tom Brady’s Saudi flag football game For the NFL and its fans, the case is more than just a legal battle—it underscores the risks athletes face off the field and raises bigger questions about how the justice system treats violent offenses committed by minors. With proceedings moving forward in juvenile court, the case will largely unfold behind closed doors, leaving its long-term impact open to speculation.","Ricky Pearsall, a rookie wide receiver for the San Francisco 49ers, was shot during an attempted robbery in 2024.

Tyler Herro sends a strong message amid injury recovery



Miami Heat facing early challenges and looming contract talks



Tyler Herro will not be on the court when the Miami Heat tip off their 2025-26 campaign. The guard underwent surgery on his left foot and ankle to repair posterior impingement syndrome, an injury that had plagued him since the offseason. The procedure, performed last Friday, is expected to sideline him for about eight weeks, pushing his return into mid-November and forcing Miami to start the season without its leading scorer.25-year-old guard Tyler Herro initially attempted to avoid surgery through platelet-rich plasma and cortisone injections, but the pain persisted, according to Herald. Doctors ultimately recommended surgery, which was deemed successful. The projected timetable means Herro could miss the team’s first 14 games.Herro didn’t stay quiet after the procedure. From the hospital bed, he took to Instagram to share his mindset during recovery: “Imma tear the league back down once I get off this weak off bed.” The post, which included a photo of Herro flashing a middle finger, sent a strong message about his determination to return.His absence is a significant blow for Miami. Last season, Herro delivered a career year, averaging 23.9 points, 5.5 assists, and 5.2 rebounds in 77 games while shooting 47.2 percent from the field and 37.5 percent from deep.He earned his first All-Star selection, won the Three-Point Contest, and quickly established himself as the Heat’s primary scoring option. The team scored 8.6 fewer points per 100 possessions when he was not on the floor.With Herro sidelined, Miami will look to offseason acquisition Norman Powell and second-year guard Pelle Larsson to absorb more playmaking responsibilities. Bam Adebayo’s versatility will be critical, but the Heat will be hard-pressed to replace Herro’s offensive creation during the opening stretch of the season.Beyond basketball, the injury arrives at a delicate moment in Herro’s career. He becomes eligible on October 1 for an extension that could add three years and $149.7 million to his existing deal. If no agreement is reached by October 20, he would be in line for a four-year, $206.9 million extension next summer.Also Read: Stephen Curry shares candid remarks about his off-court duties as parent alongside wife Ayesha Curry","Tyler Herro underwent surgery on his left foot and ankle to repair posterior impingement syndrome.

Stephen Curry has built an astonishing legacy on the NBA hardwood. However, away from the spotlight, his most demanding role happens at home. The Golden State Warriors star is the father of four children with his wife, Ayesha Curry , and he admits that life beyond basketball is filled with unpredictability, laughter, and plenty of lessons for the 37-year-old. In a recent interview, Curry shared details of parenting with his wife.The four-time NBA champion Stephen Curry says raising children at completely different life stages has shaped him as a parent. His oldest daughter, Riley, is now 13, Ryan, 10, and Canon, 7, while his youngest, Caius, is just 15 months.“Every day is a wild experience, and I’m enjoying every little bit of it,” Curry told PEOPLE. “Fans would see there’s no such thing as balance, but you try every day to figure it out.”The spread of ages, Curry explains, forces him and Ayesha to adapt constantly. “Your ability to communicate and build trust with each one individually — like, you set up rules for the house, but each one has to be parented a little differently. That’s the cool part of the experience as a parent, and I’m loving every single minute of it.”Beyond the challenges, he says the true reward is watching his children grow into unique personalities.“They all teach me something every day… they’re hilarious — they ask questions that make you think. They all came from the same place, but they have such different personalities.”Curry also points out that consistency is central to how he and Ayesha raise their family. One rule they enforce is a strict no-games policy on school nights. It’s a tradition he borrowed directly from his parents, Sonya and Dell Curry.“That’s the one part of the parent playbook that we kept — just cut, copy, and paste,” Curry said. “On school nights you gotta make sure you’re getting your rest so you can get to school, have a good time, and learn.”Still, when game days roll around, rules soften. “They’re spoiled when they come to games,” he joked. “They try to get every snack, candy, treat — whatever you wanna call it. There’s really no limit at games ’cause I want ’em to have fun.”Also Read: ""Mind your fkn business""- Stephen Curry's heartwarming defense of Ayesha Curry gets instant support as Killer Mike faces wrath from fans online Curry and Ayesha have been one of the NBA’s power couples, and they are certainly the proud parents.","NBA star Stephen Curry is the father of four children with his wife, Ayesha.

Jonathan Kuminga rejects $75M offer as contract talks hit major roadblock

Jonathan Kuminga has repetitively made headlines for the Golden State Warriors this summer as they look forward to win their fifth championship since 2015. Although the offseason has mostly focused on Kuminga and his contract impasse, his agent just provided a significant update that may lead to him signing a contract shortly. Aaron Turner, Kuminga's agent, recently sent a direct warning amid a rumored $75.2 million contract impasse.As the October 1 qualifying offer deadline draws closer, Turner reportedly sent a warning to the Warriors' front management, according to Joseph Azizi of The Warriors Talk. Kuminga 's agent, shared his thoughts on the player's feelings throughout the negotiations on The Hoop Collective podcast.Additionally, he stated that although Kuminga would prefer to accept the player option, he would also accept the qualifying offer. If the Warriors want Kuminga to re-sign with them, they must treat him ""fairly,"" according to the agency. Turner then said:""There’s a lot of upside.. He wants to pick where he wants to go. So the QO is real for sure.. for sure there's no it's being considered completely. It's being talked about…”He continued:“We've gotten a disability policy out for him that would, you know, hedge out some of the injury risk. Um, but it's not something, you know, anybody wants to do. Neither side. I mean, Brian, you know this, right? Clearly that we wouldn't be here on September 18th on this podcast discussing this if either side wanted that to be the outcome…”He then added:“This is really a one-off situation. I can't remember where you're in the middle of the negotiation. and you're willing to bring the fans in um to hear this because I'm telling you there's incredible amount of interest in Jonathan's free agency more than I can remember..”Further talking about it, he said:“And probably because he's on the Warriors and partially because it's September and he's the number one free agent on the market and there's this and the Warriors have signed nobody officially at this point…”Since July, negotiations between Kuminga's team and the Warriors have stalled.According to reports, he first rejected Golden State's $45 million offer in search of a better offer. If the Warriors were to re-sign him on the $7.9 million qualifying offer, he would reportedly be tied under a no-trade clause for the 2025–2026 season and become an unrestricted free agent.However, he reportedly turned down the Warriors' upgraded offer of a three-year, $75.2 million contract once more because the third year had a team option rather than a player option. According to reports, Kuminga would rather accept the qualifying offer than the most recent two-year, $45 million offer from the Warriors.Furthermore, Kuminga is reportedly taking control of his future top priority. Reportedly, he is even willing to accept Golden State's initial $45 million contract if it includes a player option for the second year, which would give him more freedom with the team going forward.However, Kuminga will have to accept the one-year, $7.9 million qualifying offer if no deal is negotiated by October 1. Nevertheless, recently, Turner has reportedly cautioned the franchise that such a move might cause a great deal of tension in their partnership.Also read: NBA trade rumor – Jonathan Kuminga rejects Golden State Warriors’ $45 million offer, holds out for better deal before 2025–26 season","Jonathan Kuminga's agent, Aaron Turner, recently sent a direct warning amid a rumored $75.2 million contract impasse.

LeBron James, the NBA legend, opened up about his marriage with his wife, Savannah James, recently.

Being honest is number two.
