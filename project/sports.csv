He subsequently mentored his former IPL team Kolkata Knight Riders all the way to the title, a campaign which significantly boosted his chances of replacing Dravid. In the preceding two years, Gambhir had mentored Lucknow Super Giants into the IPL playoffs.Known as a driven, no-nonsense character, the former India opener is perceived as the ideal choice as coach by BCCIFormer India opener WV Raman was the only other candidate interviewed by the BCCI's cricket advisory committee (CAC). It is understood that Gambhir will bring with him a support staff of his choice. BCCI has thanked Dravid's support staff, consisting of Paras Mhambrey, Vikram Rathour and T Dilip and wished them luck going forward.Names like Abhishek Nayar, Lakshmipathy Balaji and Vinay Kumar are doing the rounds and BCCI will invite applications soon. It is also learnt that Rathour is seen as a potential candidate to succeed VVS Laxman at the National Cricket Academy.""It is with immense pleasure that I welcome GautamGambhir as the new head coach of the Indian team. Modern-day cricket has evolved rapidly and Gautam has witnessed this changing landscape up close. Having endured the grind and excelled in various roles throughout his career, I am confident that Gautam is the ideal person to steer Indian cricket forward,"" BCCI secretary Jay Shah posted on X.""His clear vision for Team India, coupled with his vast experience, positions him perfectly to take on this exciting and most sought-after coaching role. BCCI fully supports him as he embarks on this new journey,"" Shah added.Gambhir, India's top scorer in both the 2007 T20 World Cup final and 2011 ODI World Cup final, said, ""It is an absolute honour to serve my tricolour, my people, my country. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Rahul Dravid and his team of support staff for their exemplary run with the team. I am honoured and excited to take on the role of head coach.""I have always taken pride while donning the Indian jersey during my playing days and it is going to be no different when I take up this new role. Cricket has been my passion and I look forward to working closely with the BCCI, head of cricket Mr VVS Laxman, the support staff, and, most importantly, the players, as we work towards achieving success in the upcoming tournaments,"" he added.Known for his serious demeanour during matches, Gambhir recently addressed the issue by saying, ""I am not here to entertain. I am here to win matches. That's my job as a professional.""Gambhir's leadership skills came to the fore in 2012 when he led KKR to their maiden IPL title before repeating the feat in 2014. It was during this phase that he also assumed full-time captaincy of the Delhi state team after being dropped from the Indian setup.Gambhir's outlook was simple. He did not bemoan the axe from India selectors. He wanted to win titles, both with KKR and Delhi. One of the major decisions he took was to play Delhi's home Ranji Trophy matches on lush green tracks at Roshanara Club instead of the Ferozeshah Kotla. He didn't care if he didn't score heavily. He wanted result-oriented games which could help Delhi move ahead in the competition which looked improbable on slow pitches at Kotla then. He isn't someone who is afraid of going against the grain.While the cricket world celebrates Suryakumar Yadav's T20 prowess, it was Gambhir who backed Surya's promise at KKR when he was going through uncertain times in the Mumbai cricket setup in 2013-2014.""One needs to remember the pitch at our home ground Eden Gardens was very slow and challenging. It was more so for those who batted in the lower middle order. Suryakumar consistently played those crucial knocks to take us over the line and that's why he caught the eye of people. You give players like him more responsibility. He was groomed as leader and he was announced as vice-captain of KKR for some matches in the following seasons,"" Vijay Dahiya, who has been Gambhir's trusted aid at KKR, LSG and Delhi as a support staff, told TOI.It was in the winter of 2013 that Gambhir shook the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) when he handed Navdeep Saini a first-class debut. Saini hadn't played any formal cricket in Delhi and it sparked protests. Gambhir took a firm stand and went against voices like Bishan Singh Bedi and Chetan Chauhan. A season later, he took on DDCA again to - dropping Delhi stalwarts Mithun Manhas and Rajat Bhatia because he wanted to play youngsters like Nitish Rana.When Gambhir first spoke to the owners at LSG, he clearly spelt out that he didn't want to build a team just for a couple of years. ""He had said it was important to pick players who will serve the franchise for over a longer period of time,"" sources close to Gambhir told TOI.People close to Gambhir would tell you that he felt let down when KKR decided to let him go. He believed he was coming into his own as a leader at the time and wanted to leave behind a team which could serve KKR for another five years.For Gambhir, an Ayush Badoni will be as valuable as KL Rahul. He decided that every unheralded player will be judged through the same lens. He also backed his scouting team and decided to rope in pacers like Mayank Yadav and Mohsin Khan.","Gautam Gambhir is the new head coach of Team India across formats. He replaces Rahul Dravid, who ended his tenure with the T20 World Cup win. WV Raman was the only other candidate interviewed by the BCCI's cricket advisory committee.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111620501,imgsize-62794,width-400,resizemode-4/111620501.jpg"

Iran's Al Daei, who played from 1993 to 2006, had either 108 or 109 goals, with a lingering dispute over the validity of a goal against Ecuador in 2000.Argentina's victory on its independence day extended their unbeaten streak to 10 games.

In comparison, the PSL has struggled to evolve.""India, just like their film industry, developed a cricket industry. We treat cricket as a hobby that's why we couldn't turn it into a business. PSL is still there from where it had started. The highest salary cap is $1.40 lakh. Why can't they push it further? Why can't we have players like Mitchell Starc or Pat Cummins? Because we don't have the money so there's no business,"" Latif was quoted as saying by News18.He further elaborated on India's strategic expansion in cricket, attributing their success partly to learning from foreign coaches and grassroots level development.""It's not that India became a reckoning force in world cricket recently, after the World Cup. Go back to 2007, 2011, 2015. They have gained so much knowledge from the foreign coaches and at the same time, they are working at the grassroots level without being noticed. And then IPL came into play. And now, they have all the best minds with them. They have Ponting with DC, Hussey, and Bravo. But hum kya kar rahe hain,"" Latif added.India's recent triumphs, including the T20 World Cup win and their runner-up finish in the 2023 ODI World Cup, underscore their dominance in white-ball cricket.

Mandhana hit the winning runs with a six off Nadine de Klerk.The win was the largest margin of victory for India against South Africa in this format, both in terms of wickets and balls to spare.Mandhana showcased a brilliant performance towards the end of the run chase, smashing a six in the 10th over, followed by two fours and another maximum to quickly bring the contest to a close. This was her 24th T20I half-century.During the powerplay, India managed 40 for no loss with South Africa rotating five bowlers, but none could break the partnership.

Only three of their batters managed to reach double digits, with Tazmin Brits being the top scorer with 20 runs off 23 balls.The opening partnership between Laura Wolvaardt and Brits could only muster 19 runs, and the subsequent partnerships failed to make any significant impact on the game. Shreyanka Patil dismissed Wolvaardt early in the innings, which led to a brief partnership between Brits and Marizanne Kapp. However, this partnership was short-lived as Kapp fell to Vastrakar, marking her 50th wicket in the T20 format.India's strategic use of four different bowlers in the opening four overs paid dividends, keeping the South African batters on their toes and unable to settle. The South African team, which had shown dominance with the bat in the previous matches, found the going tough against a disciplined Indian bowling attack.The pitch conditions, affected by rain in the days leading up to the match, did not favour the batters.

The consistent loss of wickets at regular intervals, with two more falling at the score of 61, highlighted the effectiveness of the Indian bowling strategy.The South African team's attempt to rebuild was thwarted by Vastrakar's bowling, which was instrumental in their collapse from 61 for 3 to being all out for 84.","India bowled South Africa out for a paltry 84 runs in the third and final women's T20 International match.

NEW DELHI: Uruguay advanced to the Copa America semi-finals after a hard-fought 0-0 draw against Brazil at the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, ultimately prevailing 4-2 in a penalty shootout.The match was marked by a red card for Uruguay's Nahitan Nandez in the second half, leaving his team with 10 men.Brazil, without the suspended Vinicius Jr, found it challenging to create chances despite their numerical advantage.In the penalty shootout, Uruguay gained the advantage when Sergio Rochet saved Eder Militao's spot kick and Douglas Luiz hit the post.Although Alisson Becker kept Brazil's hopes alive by denying Jose Maria Gimenez and Gabriel Martinelli scored his penalty, Manuel Ugarte sealed the victory for Uruguay with the decisive kick. Uruguay now face Colombia in the semi-finals as they continue their pursuit of a record-extending 16th Copa America title.""It was a very tense match, against a very tough opponent, suffering in the last minutes a man down. But we showed character despite our youth,"" Rochet said.""To finish with penalties and winning, I was able to save one... The truth is that it is a tremendous happiness that this group deserves, the country deserves it. We are very excited, so we are going for more.""The match between Brazil and Uruguay was a physical battle, with both teams committing a total of 41 fouls. Players from both sides engaged in intense challenges throughout the game.Uruguay's high-pressing strategy left little room for Brazil's young forward Endrick to operate, as he found himself on the receiving end of some tough tackles. In one instance, Ronald Araujo pushed Endrick to the ground, prompting an angry reaction from Brazil's captain Raphinha, who shoved Araujo in retaliation. The referee intervened, having a firm conversation with both players without issuing any cards.Araujo's match was cut short when he had to be substituted due to an injury just after the 30-minute mark. The game suddenly came to life moments later when Darwin Nunez missed a close-range header. Brazil quickly launched a counter-attack, but Raphinha's shot was denied by goalkeeper Rochet in what was Brazil's best chance of the first half.Uruguay struggled to penetrate Brazil's defense, prompting coach Marcelo Bielsa to make three substitutions by the 67th minute. However, his strategy was disrupted when Nandez was sent off after a VAR review for a reckless tackle on Rodrygo.Despite having a numerical advantage, Brazil failed to score against Uruguay's compact defense, as the Uruguayans opted to sit back and take their chances in the penalty shootout, knowing that there is no extra-time in the Copa America except for the final.This marks Brazil's second consecutive quarter-final exit via penalties in a major tournament, following their defeat to Croatia in the 2022 World Cup.""We want to put Brazil at the top, we will continue working and preparing for the World Cup (qualifiers),"" Endrick said.""We know that this is a difficult moment, but we hope to have the support of all Brazilians.""","Uruguay advance to the Copa America semi-finals after beating Brazil 4-2 in a penalty shootout.
