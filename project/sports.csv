When discussing the greatest boxers of all time, Mike Tyson 's name often comes to mind without hesitation. The boxing legend is renowned not only for his exceptional skills in the ring but also for his significant contributions to Hollywood and the sports industry. Tyson's achievements are extensive, making him one of the most beloved and hard-working legends in history.He even made a mark in WWE during the Attitude Era, where he was involved in storylines with other WWE icons like Stone Cold Steve Austin , Triple H, and Shawn Michaels. Although Tyson has collaborated with many wrestlers, he recently opened up in an interview with Logan Paul on the Impaulsive podcast about the Hall of Famer Mick Foley , revealing why he finds Foley intimidating.The Hell in a Cell match between Mick Foley and The Undertaker is widely regarded as one of the most iconic matches in wrestling history. After the match, Foley sustained serious injuries, including a dislocated jaw, broken ribs, and several internal injuries. Reflecting on this, Mike Tyson shared his thoughts on the Impaulsive podcast, saying, “Goddamn I’m scared of that guy. This guy, he experienced death every day of his life. He’s jumping off s**t, running in trucks and cars, man. And he’s normal. He broke every bone in his body and he’s a normal guy.” With a concerned tone, he later added, “I just don’t know why he don’t like himself so much.” (Via Impaulsive)Mike Tyson commended Mick Foley, highlighting Foley's fearless, risk-taking persona. Tyson also confessed that he's intimidated by Foley, who shows no hesitation in putting his body on the line. Beyond his infamous Hell in a Cell match with The Undertaker, Foley faced off against other legendary superstars in intense hardcore-style matches, including Triple H, Edge, Kane, The Rock, and many more.Mick Foley has achieved significant success in his wrestling career, including winning the WWE Championship three times.

'Australia will miss Warner'

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli , a stalwart of Indian batting, and Australia's Steve Smith are eager to make their mark in the upcoming Border-Gavaskar series. According to Australian great Matthew Hayden , runs will be ""at a premium"" in this highly anticipated contest.Hayden, a top-class opener during his playing days, believes that Kohli and Smith have their unique styles of dominating the game.He suggests that their performances will be crucial in determining the outcome of the series in Australia.""Cricket is a game of momentum and I'm sure those two players, coming now to the later pages of their cricketing careers, will be very keen to dominate the landscape through the summer,"" Hayden said, as quoted by PTI, on the sidelines of the Ceat Cricket Rating Awards on Wednesday.""That's their nature. They do it in very different ways, very different styles, but certainly they really are the key to the Australian summer,"" he said.India and Australia are set to face off in a five-Test series, a format that hasn't been seen between the two nations since the 1991-92 season. The first match is scheduled to commence on November 22 in Perth. According to Hayden, predicting the outcome of this series will be a challenging task, as both teams appear evenly matched.""You look at the lineups, and it's hard to really tell who has the edge. I sense that it's going to be runs that are going to be the point of difference. Guys that are sure bets have retired, like (Cheteshwar) Pujara was a sure bet in Australian conditions,"" he said.""Was he exciting? No. Was he effective? Heck, yes. When you look back over the years, guys like Raul Dravid, VVS Laxman... they were really sure bets in our market. The best need to stand up in this series, runs are going to be at a premium,"" he said.Hayden mentioned that Australian players are eager to end their winless streak against India, as their last bilateral series victory came in 2014-15.""We haven't had it (the trophy) in our hands for two series in Australia, which is kind of the coveted grounds. Not that's similar to the Steve Waugh era here in 2001, where this was the hallowed turf, this was a place where Australia really wanted to come and win,"" he said.""And his great era didn't do it. There's always this fantastic opportunity for the No. 1 (and) No. 2 sides on the World Test Championship to go head to head, especially abroad in each other's camps and see who really has those kinds of final rights...""...to claim not only the possibility of playing the (World) Test Championship (final) but also who's the very best of the best, which you judge on how you tour, not so much how you play at home,"" he said.With Nathan Lyon aiming to assert his dominance over the promising Yashasvi Jaiswal, Hayden remarked that it was a strategic move, as Jaiswal is emerging as a valuable asset for Indian cricket.""Isn't it great that the series is shaping up the bare-heavyweight bout, someone like the GOAT (Lyon) going after (Jaiswal), what is in my opinion one of the key assets for Indian cricket. Yes he's certainly proving to be that,"" he said.Hayden noted that although Jaiswal's skill in driving through covers is exceptional, he will need to make adjustments due to the length of the boundaries in Australia.""Young Jaiswal is an exciting prospect to see how he'll play. He is a package. His ability in particular to get on the up through the covers is phenomenal. That'll also have its vulnerabilities,"" Hayden said.""I'm looking forward to seeing how he adjusts on bouncy tracks. We did notice in the IPL that he's a very hard hitter of the ball, pull shots in particular, but that'll be challenged by three world-class speedsters, assuming they're all fit and on much bigger grounds.""It has to almost be the perfect contact for that ball to sail over (for a) six so you can get caught easily, three-quarters of the way in the fence. They (all) have little adjustments that world-class players like Jazzy (Jaiswal) will make for sure,"" he said.Hayden noted that Australia will miss David Warner , who announced his retirement from international cricket in July.""For the first time, it (opening slot) doesn't feel as secure. David Warner gave a great service to Australian cricket. He gave a service that was extremely competitive, wonderfully dynamic,"" he said.""He really took that legacy that I'd created through the 2000s to a new level, strike rates in excess of 80 and gave great momentum to the top order, which otherwise is quite conservative. He's an enormous loss in terms of how do you replace him,"" Hayden added.Hayden expressed reservations about Steve Smith taking on the opener's role. Although Smith has spent most of his career batting at No. 4, he was shifted to the opening slot following Warner's retirement from Test cricket.""I was on record saying that I didn't like changing. I think it's crazy to think that you have the world's best-in-class batter in a certain position and then you change to a completely different position,"" he said.","India and Australia are set to face off in a five-Test series, a format that hasn't been seen between the two nations since 1991-92 season.

Agar aap uske hisaab se sahi nahi utre, to unke thode se reaction bahar aane lagte hain. Wo aapko bateyga ki aapko ye karna tha, ya ye chaiye tha.

I got a lot of help from my three pillars, who are actually Mr Jay Shah, Mr Rahul Dravid (and the) chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar,"" he said.""That was very critical for me to do what I did and obviously not to forget the players, who came in at different points in time and helped the team to achieve what we achieved,"" he said.Rohit expressed that the feeling of winning the World Cup, which ended India's decade-long drought in global tournaments, was beyond words to describe.""(It was) a feeling that cannot come everyday. It was something that we were really hoping for. When we won the World Cup, it was important for all of us to enjoy the moment which we did pretty well and thanks to our nation as well for celebrating with us,"" he said.""As much as it meant for us, it meant a whole lot to the entire nation as well. It felt really great to bring it (trophy) back home here and celebrate with everyone here.""""(It is a) fantastic feeling that can never be put out in words. I don't think it's a feeling that can be expressed.

I have seen a lot of guys who are pretty much into 'how many grains the bat has', 'what is the weight of the bat' and 'how does it look from outside', but I am not that kind of a person. I will pick up the bat and if I feel this is the right bat, I will go and play with that,"" he said.Despite leading the Mumbai Indians to five IPL titles as captain, Rohit's hunger to add more trophies to his collection remains insatiable.""There is a reason I won five IPL trophies.

Mayank Yadav: Remember Mayank Yadav?

NEW DELHI: Mayank Yadav , the promising 22-year-old fast bowler for Lucknow Super Giants , emerged as one of the standout players in IPL 2024 , impressing with his sheer pace and taking seven wickets in just four games. However, his season was abruptly halted due to injury, leading to uncertainty about his return to competitive cricket.BCCI secretary Jay Shah expressed doubts about Yadav's availability for the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Test series scheduled for December.While recovering at the National Cricket Academy (NCA), former India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey insists on easing Yadav back into action, particularly focusing on first-class cricket.Yadav's blistering speed captured attention early in the IPL 2024 season, consistently bowling at speeds exceeding 150 kmph, and delivering the fourth fastest ball in IPL history at 156.7 kmph. Unfortunately, an injury curtailed his participation after just four games where he secured seven wickets.""I cannot give you any answer on Mayank Yadav as there is no guarantee whether he will be in the team or not. But he is potentially a good fast bowler, and we are looking after him. He is currently at the NCA,"" Shah told The Times of India last week.The concerns around Yadav's injury have sparked discussions about his immediate future and the appropriate path for his recovery. Former India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey advocates for a gradual reintroduction to competitive cricket, particularly in the longer format. Mhambrey argues that keeping Yadav sidelined out of caution may not be the best approach for the young pacer.""I don't agree that if he is not ready, just don't play him. This is the age where he has to bowl. A bowler should bowl. The more you bowl, the more you will have control, you will know your threshold as to how much your body can take. You can't wrap him up in cotton wool saying he will get injured,"" Mhambrey told The Indian Express in an interview.Mhambrey believes that Yadav's development and injury management would benefit from playing red-ball cricket. He emphasized that first-class cricket is crucial for gaining the necessary experience and for understanding individual physical limits.""We can't overbowl and burn him out, but we have to be smart about how much he should bowl. As a fast bowler, he needs to play first-class cricket,"" Mhambrey said.He stressed the importance of studying Yadav's background and training regimen to better manage his fitness and workload.""You have to check his background. How much cricket has he played? How much has he bowled? Everything adds up. We need to go in depth about him, what have been his training methods? How many overs he used to bowl, his history of injuries,"" Mhambrey noted.Mhambrey also highlighted the significance of understanding that Yadav is still in the developmental phase of his career, and proactive management of his workload and fitness is crucial.""He's only 22. His body is still developing. He is in that injury-prone age group. His body has not completely developed yet. His injuries can be controlled if we understand his background well.""As the BCCI deliberates on the best course of action for Yadav, the young pacer's return to full fitness remains eagerly anticipated by fans and selectors alike. His impressive performances in the IPL have shown glimpses of his potential, and managing his recovery effectively could be key to his future success in Indian cricket.","Mayank Yadav was one of the standout players in IPL 2024.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh's preparations for the upcoming two-Test series against Pakistan have been severely disrupted by the political unrest that has engulfed the nation. The foreign coaches of the team were confined to their residences, strictly adhering to the advisories issued by their respective embassies, while widespread protests prevented the team from gathering for training sessions.The composition of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) is also uncertain, following the departure of president Nazmul Hassan from the country due to his ties with the ousted prime minister, Sheikh Hasina.Despite the political upheaval, star allrounder Shakib Al Hasan , who served as a member of parliament for Hasina's party, has been permitted to participate in the Pakistan series by the interim government.""Because of the situation it was not possible to practice,"" spin bowling coach Mushtaq Ahmed told reporters.The Pakistan Cricket Board offered some relief to the visiting team by inviting them to arrive four days earlier to compensate for their lack of preparation.A second-string Bangladesh team, including six players from the national squad, had already been participating in practice matches in Islamabad since August 10.Further compounding Bangladesh's challenges, in-form opener Mahmudul Hasan Joy has been sidelined from the first Test due to a groin injury, although senior batter Mushfiqur Rahim is expected to recover from a finger injury in time for the match.Bangladesh will be determined to break their winless streak against Pakistan, having suffered defeats in 12 out of the 13 Tests played between the two nations, with only one draw. The two-match Test series is part of the third cycle of the World Test Championship , with Pakistan currently occupying the sixth position in the nine-team table, while Bangladesh sits in eighth place.The second Test, originally scheduled to be held in Karachi, has been relocated to Rawalpindi due to ongoing construction work at the Karachi stadium and will commence on August 30.Following a 3-0 defeat in Australia earlier this year, Pakistan has brought in former Australian paceman Jason Gillespie as their Test coach and hired Adelaide groundsman Damien Hough to improve the quality of their pitches. Pakistan is expected to field an all-pace attack for the first Test, a strategy they last employed five years ago against Sri Lanka at the same venue.In contrast, Bangladesh will heavily rely on their spin trio of Shakib Al Hasan (237 wickets), Taijul Islam (195 wickets), and Mehidy Hasan Miraz (164 wickets).Pakistan captain Shan Masood dismissed the notion that the Bangladesh team is underprepared, stating, ""You expect all international Test sides to come into a series well prepared and trying to play their best cricket.""Masood also expressed optimism about Pakistan's potential improvement under the guidance of their new coaching staff, saying, ""We are excited to see how they (coaches) help us to be better people, better cricketers and -- most importantly -- be among the top teams in the world.""Pakistan vs Bangladesh 1st Test match will be played from Wednesday, August 21 to August 25.Pakistan vs Bangladesh 1st Test match will be played at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium in Rawalpindi.The live streaming of the first Test match between Pakistan and Bangladesh will be available on the Tamasha app and website for viewers in India.The upcoming Test series between Pakistan and Bangladesh will not be aired on any television channel. Indian viewers will be unable to watch the live telecast of the first Test match between the two nations on their TV sets, as no broadcaster holds the rights to televise the series.Cricket fans in India need not worry about missing out on the excitement of the game, despite the absence of a television broadcast deal.

Their batting records, consistency, and the ability to perform under pressure have inspired generations of cricketers in India and around the world.Gavaskar was the first player to score 10,000 runs in Test cricket . He held the record for the most Test centuries (34) for almost two decades before it was surpassed by Tendulkar.It was in the first Test against Bangladesh at the Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka in the 2004 series that Tendulkar equalled Gavaskar 's record of Test centuries.The first Test of the two-match series saw Anil Kumble breaking Kapil Dev 's record of 434 wickets to become India's leading Test wicket-taker and the rise of Irfan Pathan who registered his first ten-wicket haul in Tests on the third day at the Bangabandhu Stadium in Dhaka in December 2004.Pathan's five-wicket haul in the first innings saw Bangladesh being bundled out for 184. From then on, it was the Sachin Tendulkar show all the way.Sachin completed his 34th Test century to equal Sunil Gavaskar's record of Test centuries and also went on to notch up his career-best Test score (248*).Tendulkar, who was dropped when he was on 28 and 47, struck 35 boundaries in his knock and added 164 runs with Ganguly (71) for the fourth wicket and put up a 133-run stand with Zaheer (75) for the last wicket as India amassed 526 runs.Pathan then wrapped up the match early on Day 4 taking 6/51 in the Bangladesh second innings as India won by an innings and 140 runs.Tendulkar is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in cricket history and holds the record for the most runs in both Test and ODI cricket. He is the only player to have scored 100 international centuries (51 in Tests and 49 in ODIs).",Sachin Tendulkar equalled Sunil Gavaskar's record of Test centuries in 2004.

Jaiswal is a package: Hayden

MUMBAI: Having won the T20 World Cup in the West Indies in June, Indian captain Rohit Sharma is now greedy for more trophies in his cabinet.“There’s a reason I won five IPL trophies. I’m not going to stop, you know, because once you get a taste of winning games, winning cups, you don’t want to stop. We’ll keep pushing as a team. We’ll keep striving for new things in the future.We’ve got a couple of solid tours coming up, very challenging ones as well. So, yes, for us, it never stops. Once you achieve something, you always look forward to achieving more, and that is what I’ll be doing as well. I’m pretty sure that my teammates will be thinking on the same lines as well. It’s exciting times for Indian cricket moving forward,” Rohit said at the Ceat Cricket Rating Awards on Wednesday.“Honestly, for the last two years from what I’ve seen in Indian cricket, there’s some real excitement, some good cricket being played as well. The next couple of years are exciting as well. So hopefully, we can go out there and enjoy the game at the same time, and then try and make the most of what opportunity lies ahead of us,” the Indian captain asserted.Meanwhile, BCCI secretary Jay Shah is at it again. Almost six months after successfully predicting India’s T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies, Shah has forecast that India could win three trophies in a row-the Women’s T20 World Cup in October in UAE, the ICC Champions Trophy in February next year in Pakistan, and the World Test Championship final in England in June 2025.“As I told you in Rajkot, that we are going to host our flag in Barbados, and our captain did that. If we have the blessing of 1.4 billion people, then we can do the same in the Champions Trophy, WTC final and the Women’s T20 World Cup,” Shah, who received the ‘CEAT Award for Excellence in Sports Administration’ said.Meanwhile, New Zealand captain Tim Southee reckons India pace spearheadJasprit Bumrah has looked more formidable since making a comeback from a back injury, which kept him out of the game for a major part in 2022.""To be able to firstly bounce back from the major injury and come back, he's even better than what he was beforehand. Throw in on top of that, having to juggle multiple formats, can be difficult at times as well,"" Southee said.""He seems to have been able to do that with ease. He's probably more experienced, understands his game a bit more. He probably had that time where he was injured to come back and be recharged, refreshed. We are just seeing a great version (of Bumrah) across all three formats. He's brilliant across all three at the moment. I don't think there's anyone that he's better in (better than him), he is tremendous across all three (formats),"" he said.Former Aussie great Matthew Hayden has given a thumbs-up to Australian off-spinner Nathan Lyon's idea to start planning for Yashasvi Jaiswal , whom he felt was an ‘asset’ for Indian cricket, for the Border-Gavaskar five-Test series in December.""Isn't it great that the series is shaping up the bare-heavyweight bout, someone like the GOAT going after, what is in my opinion one of the key assets for Indian cricket. Yes, he's certainly proving to be that,"" Hayden said.Complimenting Jaiswal as a 'package' Hayden said that Jaiswal's ability to hit on the up through covers is 'phenomenal.'

The integration of these materials has been shown to significantly enhance the durability of the pitch.The implementation of Stitched Hybrid Pitches not only extends the lifespan of the playing surface but also enables venues to host three times the number of matches compared to traditional pitches.SIS Pitches has launched its operations in India and has successfully installed these pitches at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA), where they have already delivered impressive results.""We've installed eight pitches at the HPC Stadium in Dharamshala. There are four on the main stadium site. and then there's two each in the practice areas.

So Jonny Bairstow , Sam Curran , Tom Curran , and Liam Livingstone played there and they noticed it was a hybrid,"" he added.Given that the cricketing fraternity is confused by the new pitches being introduced in the game after the use of drop-in pitches in the USA phase of the T20 World Cup, Paul emphasized on how different the two surfaces are and the benefits of the new innovation.""A drop in pitch, is a fully natural surface that's built in sort of movable trays that are lifted in and out of a cricket ground or a sports stadium but it's still a fully natural pitch. with natural grass. A hybrid pitch is one where artificial fibers are injected into the natural turf surface and effectively gives the profile of the soil and the grass strength and stability. and that enables more play to take place, the pitch lives longer. The pace and bounce will increase over time. and effectively, you can play up to three times the amount of cricket on the same pitch,"" concluded Paul.",Former England cricketer Paul Taylor is introducing Stitched Hybrid Pitches. Hybrid pitches are composed of a blend of natural turf grass and approximately five percent twisted yarn. SIS Pitches has launched its operations in India and has successfully installed these pitches at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112686947,imgsize-37730,width-400,resizemode-4/112686947.jpg"
Indian batters against spin needs mental shift: Assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/indian-batters-against-spin-needs-mental-shift-assistant-coach-ryan-ten-doeschate/articleshow/112686218.cms,"NEW DELHI: Assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate openly acknowledged that Indian batsmen's eagerness to perform well in foreign conditions has negatively impacted their proficiency against spin bowling.He stated that his primary objective is to help them regain their expertise in this area as they prepare for a crucial season that includes five home Test matches.India, known for their prowess against spin, surprisingly struggled in the recent three-match ODI series in Sri Lanka, where they lost 27 wickets to the host nation's spinners.The 0-2 series defeat marked India's first bilateral ODI series loss against Sri Lanka in nearly three decades.""We got undone against Sri Lanka. The mindset of India has been such that they've been so desperate to do well overseas,"" Doeschate told Talksport Cricket, as quoted by PTI.""The focus has moved to doing well in Australia and England. We've kind of let playing spin, which was always a strength of the Indian team, fall back a little bit.""That's one thing I'm looking forward to helping with, getting to that position where Indians are the best players of spin in the world again,"" said Doeschate.India will host Bangladesh and New Zealand in five Test matches during September and October. The visiting teams possess skilled spinners who could pose challenges for the Indian batsmen.According to Doeschate, a former Netherlands all-rounder with extensive coaching experience globally, tackling spin bowling effectively is more about a mental adjustment than significant technical modifications. He stated, playing spin is about making a mental shift rather than bringing about major technical changes.""I don't think much of what we're going to bring is technical knowledge. It's more about mindsets, situational awareness, and how we think they can control certain phases of the game.""We need to throw ideas out there... de-briefing and keeping the mental space really good. That's going to be really important,"" he elaborated.The 44-year-old Dutchman, who will be assisting head coach Gautam Gambhir and Abhishek Nayar , expressed that the team is eager to win the Champions Trophy next year.""There's the Champions Trophy (February 2025). With only three ODIs left in preparation, it's going to be really challenging to switch between the formats and get the team ready for that, which again is something they're desperate to win,"" he said.Doeschate stated that qualifying for the World Test Championship (WTC) final in June next year is another crucial goal for Team India .Currently, India lead the WTC table, with Australia close behind, and Doeschate aims to use the 10 Tests India is scheduled to play to solidify their strong position.""In terms of what we're looking forward to... qualifying for the WTC final... there's a great opportunity with 10 Tests left.""We have five (Tests) in India and then we are going to Australia (for another five Tests), which is going to be great.""Doeschate mentioned that stepping into the Indian cricketing establishment was a daunting task, especially following their T20 World Cup victory in June.""In terms of timing (his appointment), it's quite difficult to walk into a team that's just come back with the (T20) World Cup.""But in terms of what's ahead of us for the next 18 months, it's mouth-watering as a coach. It's all the series you want to be involved in and all the challenges you want to come up against,"" he said.","Assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate says Indian batsmen's eagerness to perform well in foreign conditions has negatively impacted their proficiency against spin bowling.

This decision follows a hearing held on August 15th, where evidence and testimonies were presented.Sinner, who achieved a career-high ranking of world No. 1 in June 2023, provided an explanation for the positive tests.He claimed that a member of his support team unknowingly used an over-the-counter spray containing Clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid, to treat a minor wound on Sinner. The same team member subsequently administered massages to Sinner, inadvertently leading to the contamination.The ITIA, after reviewing the evidence and accepting Sinner's explanation, concluded that the violation lacked intent.This determination, supported by the independent tribunal's findings, resulted in a ""No Fault or Negligence"" ruling, effectively clearing Sinner of intentional doping charges.The incident occurred during the Indian Wells tournament, where Sinner initially tested positive for low levels of Clostebol metabolites.A second positive test from an out-of-competition sample collected eight days later led to a provisional suspension, which was later lifted following Sinner's successful appeal.Despite the investigation and its impact on his Indian Wells results, Sinner has continued to excel on the court.

That's the most important thing.”The US Open is set to commence on August 26 in New York City.In Cincinnati, Sinner and Tiafoe both reached their maiden finals, surpassing their previous best performances of reaching the third round.Despite Tiafoe's efforts to force a tiebreak in the opening set, a series of three consecutive errors resulted in a 7-6 loss.Sinner established a commanding 5-1 lead in the second set, but Tiafoe managed to save three match points, narrowing the gap to 5-2. However, Sinner ultimately prevailed, successfully serving out the match to secure the victory.Tiafoe's journey to the final was marked by unusual circumstances. In the quarterfinals on Saturday, he claimed the first set before his opponent, Hubert Hurkacz, retired due to a calf injury. Subsequently, in the semifinals, Tiafoe showcased his resilience by saving two match points and defeating Holger Rune in a thrilling three-set encounter.An American male tennis player hasn't secured the championship in Cincinnati since 2006, when Andy Roddick achieved the feat.Sabalenka, who climbed to the No. 2 position in the rankings prior to the match, showcased her dominance by winning the tournament without dropping a single set. This victory marks her 15th WTA title.Despite her previous struggles in Cincinnati, where she had never advanced beyond the semifinals, losing three times at that stage, Sabalenka finally broke through to claim the trophy.At 26 years old, Sabalenka has established herself as a top contender for the upcoming U.S. Open. The Belarusian player was forced to miss Wimbledon due to a shoulder injury but made her return to the tour two weeks ago in Washington.“I would say that I'm really playing great tennis,” Sabalenka said. “Probably not the best tennis I can play but I'm definitely getting there. Hopefully at the US Open I can reach even higher levels.”Sabalenka quickly established a commanding 4-1 lead in the opening set against Pegula, taking just 17 minutes to assert her dominance. Despite Pegula's efforts to mount a comeback, including breaking Sabalenka's serve for the first time to level the second set at 5-5, her five double faults proved costly.Sabalenka, however, remained focused and determined, claiming the next two games to secure victory in a match that lasted 1 hour and 14 minutes.“She was playing at a high level and never really came down,” Pegula said. “When she’s serving really well, it’s tough, especially on these fast courts.”Pegula, the sixth-ranked player, faced a tough journey to reach the final. Following her successful title defense in Toronto, the American had to play two matches on Friday due to delays caused by weather conditions. Additionally, three of her matches extended to three sets.“I'm proving to myself that I can play a lot of matches and overcome a lot of challenges,” Pegula said. “I'm looking forward to not doing anything for a few days.""Sabalenka joined top-ranked Iga Swiatek as the only players with 10 or more WTA titles since 2020. She beat Swiatek in the Cincinnati semis.","Top-seeded Jannik Sinner defeated Frances Tiafoe 7-6 (4), 6-2 in the final of the Cincinnati Open. Second-ranked Ayrna Sabalenka defeated Jessica Pegula 6-3, 7-5 in the women's final. This marks the first time either player has won the title at the prestigious tournament.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112639106,imgsize-80218,width-400,resizemode-4/112639106.jpg"

The scoreline read 7-6(9) 5-7 7-6(4) as Sinner advanced to the Cincinnati Open final on Sunday.Sinner's opponent in the championship match will be Frances Tiafoe.Sinner, who has already claimed four ATP Tour titles this year, more than any other player, showed signs of discomfort throughout the match, occasionally limping and favoring his right hip.However, he displayed immense determination to overcome the 2021 Cincinnati champion in a grueling encounter that lasted three hours and seven minutes.""It means a lot to me. It's a very different moment, what I'm going through, so I'm very happy about this result,"" Reuters quoted Sinner from his on-court interview.""The physical aspect, of course, I have to improve, because if I want to win Grand Slams or a bigger title, I have to be, for sure, more in shape.""But I just tried to stay there mentally, which I'm very proud (of), and let's see what's coming tomorrow.""Sinner mounted a comeback in the first set, breaking Zverev's serve when the German was just three points away from clinching the opener. The set proceeded to a tiebreak, which was briefly interrupted by rain. Sinner ultimately secured the first set with a well-placed backhand volley on his third set point.In the second set, both players managed to break each other's serve early on. However, Zverev held his serve to love, taking a 6-5 lead. He then capitalized on Sinner's error in the following game, as the Italian sent a forehand smash into the net, allowing Zverev to level the match.The deciding set was a closely fought battle, with neither player facing a break point. The match was forced into another tiebreak, where Sinner showcased his dominance. The Italian lost only one point on his serve throughout the tiebreak and sealed the victory when Zverev sent a backhand long.In the second semi-final, Tiafoe, who was not seeded, emerged victorious against Holger Rune, the 15th seed from Denmark, with a score of 4-6, 6-1, 7-6(4). This triumph propelled Tiafoe to the most significant final of his professional tennis career.Rune managed to secure the sole break in the opening set, taking a 5-4 lead before successfully serving out the set. However, Tiafoe responded with a dominant performance in the second set, breezing through it in a mere 25 minutes, ultimately forcing a decisive third set.Initially, Rune appeared to be in control, establishing a commanding 5-2 lead. Tiafoe, undeterred, held his serve and then broke Rune's serve to love. Facing two match points on his own serve, Tiafoe displayed remarkable resilience, saving both and leveling the score at 5-5.The match culminated in a tiebreak, which concluded when Rune's shot sailed long, sealing Tiafoe's victory.By advancing to the final, Tiafoe has made history as the first American player to reach this stage of the tournament since John Isner in 2013.","Italian tennis star Jannik Sinner defeated Alexander Zverev 7-6(9) 5-7(4) in the Cincinnati Open semi-final.
