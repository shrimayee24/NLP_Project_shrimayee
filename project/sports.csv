IAF Officer Namansh Syal Flown Back to India After Tejas Jet Crash in Dubai Air Show

How the tragic mishap occurred?

NEW DELHI: Wing Commander Afshan saluted her husband, Wing Commander Namansh Syal, as she paid her last respects to him.Wing Commander Namansh Syal lost his life in the LCA Tejas crash in Dubai on 21st November.The mortal remains of Wing Commander Namansh Syal were brought to his native village of Patialkar in Himachal Pradesh’s Kangra district on Sunday.Villagers, family members and officials gathered to pay emotional tributes as his last rites are set to be performed.The Indian Air Force (IAF) confirmed the pilot’s demise after the aircraft crashed and burst into flames during a low-level aerobatic demonstration at Al Maktoum International Airport, Dubai on Friday.Local residents and friends described Syal as a “gem” and the pride of their village and school.Sandeep Kumar, a local, said, “We are from the same village as Namansh, Patialkar. Everyone in our village is sad. He was like our younger brother. This should not have happened. We do not have words. We met him 3-4 months ago when he visited our village.”Pankaj Chadha, who studied alongside Wing Commander Namansh Syal, recalled their school days and how he was a gem.""I have also studied in the same school as Namansh, Sainik School Sujanpur Tira. We have lost one of our gems. He was the pride of our school. We will go to his native village, Patialkar. He made all of us very proud,"" Chadha said.The Tejas Mark-1 fighter jet was performing an eight-minute aerobatic demonstration when it could not recover from a low-altitude “negative G-turn,” plunging to the ground and erupting into flames in front of a large audience.Visuals from the Dubai Air Show showed the jet crashing and sending thick black smoke into the sky. Emergency teams rushed to the site, but Wing Commander Syal could not eject in time and sustained fatal injuries.This was the second crash involving the lightweight multi-role Tejas since its induction into the IAF a decade ago. The first crash, near Jaisalmer in March last year, saw the pilot safely eject. The IAF has ordered a court of inquiry to ascertain the cause of the crash, coordinating with Dubai aviation authorities and recovering the aircraft’s black box.Veteran pilots highlight that such accidents can occur due to sudden loss of power, control malfunction or spatial disorientation during negative G maneuvers","Wing Commander Namansh Syal lost his life in the LCA Tejas crash in Dubai on 21st November.

Candace Owens PRANKED Mid-Conspiracy: Falls for Bogus Tip Linking Plane to Kirk’s Death

Candace Owens On Feminism, Zionism, Who Assassinated Charlie Kirk?





Candace Owens claims Charlie Kirk sent a very scary text message the day before he died. She says Charlie Kirk told a Turning Point USA worker, “They are going to kill me.” She said this message was sent just one day before he was shot on September 10 at an event in Utah. Candace Owens spoke about this on the Myron Gaines podcast, where she made many strong claims about what she thinks happened.She said she does not like the silence from people inside Turning Point USA and believes someone is hiding something. Owens also said Charlie Kirk’s views were changing right before his death and that things around him felt tense. She says he told Tucker Carlson to “go max,” and she believes many people around him were upset about it. Her statements have now created a big debate online.On the podcast, Myron Gaines asked Candace Owens who she thought was “most responsible” for what happened to Charlie Kirk. She said his death did not feel simple and that she believed something bigger was happening. Owens said that one Turning Point USA staff member has the text message from Charlie Kirk where he wrote, “They are going to kill me.”She said this message was not about the trans lobby. She did not name the person who received the text.She said she did not understand why the staff member never shared the warning with the public.Candace Owens also said she did not like how Turning Point USA was acting after Charlie Kirk’s death. She said it felt strange and did not match how close people said they were to Kirk. She said Charlie Kirk knew he would die young and believed she would be the one to speak up for him.Owens then said she believes Charlie Kirk’s killing was a “military hit.” She said she does not know who ordered it but feels sure it looked like a planned attack. She also said she sees what she calls “faith infiltration” inside Turning Point USA. She believes some people got close to Kirk on purpose.Candace Owens also claimed that an Egyptian military plane was sitting at an airport near the event on the day Charlie Kirk was shot. She said the plane did not move and was “known to” Turning Point USA. She suggested this looked unusual.Also Read: Candace Owens raises heat while claiming Erika Kirk is on autopilot and holds no verifiable lies after Charlie Kirk was killed","Candace Owens claims Charlie Kirk sent a very scary text message the day before he died.

Taylor Swift’s Disney+ docuseries faces unexpected legal threat from Florida courtroom as Travis Kelce remains silent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/taylor-swifts-disney-docuseries-faces-unexpected-legal-threat-from-florida-courtroom-as-travis-kelce-remains-silent/articleshow/125552797.cms,"Taylor Swift's Disney+ docuseries faces a legal challenge from Florida artist Kimberly Marasco, who alleges copyright infringement. Marasco seeks to halt the release, claiming Swift used her poetry for lyrics and visual themes. Swift's team dismisses the claims as baseless, and legal experts deem an injunction unlikely, though the case sparks debate on creative overlap.

Taylor Swift Reveals Favorite Track, Talks Travis Kelce And New Album “The Life Of A Showgirl”

Why the legal showdown over “End of an Era” could reshape the conversation around creative overlap

The countdown to Taylor Swift’s December 12 Disney+ docuseries premiere has suddenly collided with a legal hurdle, as Florida artist Kimberly Marasco pushes for a court-ordered pause on the release. The dispute has gained national attention not only because it targets one of the world’s most influential pop figures, but because the case sits before Judge Aileen Cannon, a judicial name already familiar to the political and legal spotlight.Swift’s camp strongly rejects the allegations, calling the claims “absurd and legally baseless,” and legal experts say the odds of blocking a global streaming launch are extremely slim. Still, the injunction request has ignited a serious conversation about copyright boundaries, artistic ownership, and creative influence in modern entertainment.Marasco claims Swift pulled from her poetry for lyrics and visual themes spanning Lover, Folklore, Midnights, and The Tortured Poets Department, arguing that releasing The End of an Era would compound the alleged infringement.Her motion warns of “irreparable harm,” stating that once streamed, her creative expression could become “irreversibly embedded in cultural products beyond Plaintiff's reach.”That assertion highlights a larger phenomenon, how quickly creative concepts spread and become impossible to retract once embedded in global media consumption.Swift’s legal team counters with the fundamental principle of copyrighted material: ideas and broad concepts cannot be owned. As they put it, “the concepts of fire or love cannot be owned by one person.” That argument aligns with entertainment law norms: copyright protects specific expression—not vibes, motifs, or emotional themes.Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani supports that legal reality, noting it must be “substantially similar or really identical” to constitute infringement, and he says he simply doesn’t see that. His blunt assessment: “I would be ‘shocked’ if the motion is granted.”Still, this case serves as a cultural flashpoint. It raises questions about the fuzzy edge between inspiration and imitation, between shared artistic language and proprietary authorship. Even if the injunction fails, as many expect, this dispute may influence how artists, studios, and streaming platforms document and archive creative processes going forward.All eyes now turn to Judge Cannon’s ruling, with Swift’s project in limbo, but the cultural debate already fully underway.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s latest decision with Travis Kelce leaves Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds stunned","Taylor Swift's Disney+ docuseries faces a legal challenge from Florida artist Kimberly Marasco, who alleges copyright infringement.

Readers are encouraged to take this analysis with a grain of salt and stay tuned for official updates as the offseason unfolds.)

Why Dominguez and Jones May Be on the Move

New York Yankees at Houston Astros (Image via Imagn Images)

Pros and Cons of the Potential Trades

Aspect Pros Cons Yankees Gain lineup clarity, reduce logjam, acquire proven talent for playoffs Risk losing future stars who could develop into cornerstone players Dominguez/Jones Better chance for MLB playing time and growth in new team environments Uncertainty of adjustment and pressure of immediate impact Trade partners Obtain high-upside young talents at below-market costs Development risks; prospects may not fulfill top potential

What Each Party Gains

The New York Yankees are heading into one of their most defining offseasons in years, with reports indicating they are prepared to commit $165 million to secure a major offensive upgrade. Whether that player is Cody Bellinger - capable of playing first base and designated hitter - or star outfielder Kyle Tucker, the move signals a decisive shift toward prioritizing veteran stability and postseason readiness. Such an investment reflects the Yankees’ determination to maximize their championship window immediately.Yet this anticipated signing has triggered a significant secondary storyline: the uncertain future of top prospects Jasson Dominguez and Spencer Jones. For years, the organization nurtured these two as potential franchise pillars. But with the outfield becoming increasingly congested, their paths to the majors may now be closing faster than expected.If the New York Yankees finalize this high-priced addition, they would enter 2026 with Aaron Judge, Trent Grisham, and their new star occupying outfield or DH roles. Given this roster construction, Dominguez and Jones might be squeezed out, prompting the team to consider trading one or both.MLB contenders frequently sacrifice young talent for established reliability, and the New York Yankees could follow suit by dealing these prospects to bolster their bullpen or address other depth concerns.Teams looking for controllable, high-upside outfielders - especially the Chicago Cubs or San Diego Padres - could become natural trade partners. These franchises may even connect to bigger trade rumors, such as scenarios involving Fernando Tatis Jr., with prospects acting as premium trade currency.Below is the full table based on the scenario:Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets could sign for $14.3 million Minnesota Twins All-Star to form deadly duo with Juan Soto For the New York Yankees, this approach simplifies roster construction around proven veterans while ensuring their $165 million investment delivers maximum value. For rebuilding or mid-tier teams, Dominguez and Jones offer enormous future potential at minimal financial cost. Dominguez posted a .257 average with 10 homers and 23 steals across 123 games in 2025, plus a .980 OPS after Tommy John surgery. Jones delivered a breakout minor league campaign with 35 home runs, 80 RBIs, 29 steals, and a .932 OPS, though his 179 strikeouts in 506 plate appearances remain a concern.",The New York Yankees are expected to sign Cody Bellinger for $165 million.

Trey Benson latest injury update: Could the Cardinals finally unleash their most explosive young playmaker in Week 13?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/trey-benson-latest-injury-update-could-the-cardinals-finally-unleash-their-most-explosive-young-playmaker-in-week-13/articleshow/125565992.cms,"Trey Benson (via Getty Images)

Trey Benson’s recovery progress and why Arizona needs him back on the field

Trey Benson’s 2025 campaign was supposed to be the year the Cardinals finally saw what he could do in a featured role as the starting running back. Instead, injuries have kept the backfield in constant flux. Benson stepped in as the starter after James Conner suffered a season-ending injury, only to go down with a knee hiccup in his very first start.Since then, Arizona has cycled through Emari Demercado, Bam Knight, and Michael Carter with limited success. With Benson back practising and his return window officially opened, Week 13 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers may be the first real chance for the Cardinals to reset their rushing attack and evaluate whether Benson can be a foundational piece moving forward.Trey Benson returned as a limited participant in practice last week, a promising sign considering Arizona held him out against the Jaguars for precautionary reasons. With Emari Demercado also sidelined, the Cardinals leaned on their heavy hitters, Michael Carter and Bam Knight, but the results underscored just how thin the position group has become.No Arizona running back has surpassed an “80” in PFSN’s Impact Rankings all year, which is a reflection of both the unit’s inconsistency and the void left by Conner and Benson.Carter’s 78.5 in Week 6 remains the high-water mark. What Benson offers is a combination of burst, vision, and power that the current rotation simply lacks.His 4.6 yards per carry as a rookie is an efficient feat, and he elevated that to an impressive 5.5 yards per attempt in limited action this season. Even though his lone start ended prematurely, those numbers make a compelling case for giving him a full workload once he’s cleared. At 3-8 and effectively removed from the playoff picture, Arizona’s priority now shifts toward player development and future roster construction.Getting Benson back is not just about stabilising the offence; it’s about gathering real data on whether he can anchor the backfield beyond 2025. If healthy, he is expected to reclaim the starting job immediately, offering the Cardinals a much-needed opportunity to evaluate his ceiling over the final stretch of the season.Also read: Will Trey Benson play against the Tennessee Titans today?

MLB trade rumor: Kyle Gibson hints at surprising Nick Castellanos trade fit with a $2.55B NL Central club after Phillies cut his playing time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/mlb-trade-rumor-kyle-gibson-hints-at-surprising-nick-castellanos-trade-fit-with-a-2-55b-nl-central-club-after-phillies-cut-his-playing-time/articleshow/125577803.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Kyle Gibson backs Nick Castellanos as a trade target for the St. Louis Cardinals during offseason

Nick Castellanos has become the hot topic in trade discussions after a tough season with the Phillies. He faced challenges at the plate, had issues in the outfield, and allegedly had disagreements with manager Rob Thomson. Then, Kyle Gibson, a seasoned pitcher for the Cardinals, threw out a daring idea on a podcast. He mentioned that the Cardinals might want to think about trading for Castellanos.Gibson highlighted that Castellanos offers leadership, experience, and a strong winning mentality, traits that would benefit the Cardinals' young lineup. The team is valued at $2.55 billion and can accommodate his $20 million salary, making this trade feasible. With the Phillies’ outfield getting crowded and Castellanos’ role diminishing, this deal could be advantageous for both sides. Gibson’s remarks transformed a rumor into a narrative that works for all parties involved.Gibson, who was an All-Star in 2017, joined the Cardinals on a one-year, $13 million contract before the 2025 season. He knows Castellanos pretty well from their battles in the NL East when he was with the Phillies and Nationals.During the November 24 episode of ""Cardinal Territory,"" a podcast that focuses on the Cardinals and is hosted by local media personalities, Gibson didn’t shy away from sharing his views on offseason targets.""I think a trade for Nick Castellanos could be an interesting one for the Cardinals,"" Gibson said directly to the hosts. ""You get a right-handed outfield DH bat, that could be interesting. Knowing Nick, how he is in the clubhouse as a veteran, I think could be good. (He has a) Really, really want-to-win type personality, and I know that maybe that's not the year the Cardinals could find themselves in, but I think it could be an interesting move.

Two-Time Stanley Cup Champ calls on Matthews to lead the way





Can The Maple Leafs Save This Season? | JD Bunkis Podcast

The Toronto Maple Leafs are enduring one of their roughest starts in years, sitting at the bottom of the Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference with a 9-10-3 record. Seven losses in their last eight games have turned frustration into urgency, and now the spotlight is fixed on captain Auston Matthews as the franchise looks for direction. He has been sidelined for five games with a lower-body injury, yet the conversation around him has only intensified, raising questions about leadership, responsibility, and competitive fire.Matthews returned to the ice for practice on Monday, offering hope that he may rejoin the lineup against the Columbus Blue Jackets. With only 14 points across 17 games before the injury, his season has not reflected the dominance expected from him. This is why recent public commentary from those who understand championship pressure has added greater weight to the moment.Kris Versteeg, who lifted the Stanley Cup twice with the Blackhawks, didn’t hold back when discussing Matthews on the “JD Bunkis” Podcast. Versteeg said, “Matthews coming back… if you’re Matthews, you’re a player, this is kinda a moment that you got put the team on your back and take them back.Because everyone is talking about Marner, is the guy, this is the reason this team isn’t winning, or this reason.”This isn’t a casual observation. Versteeg has lived through pressure moments and thrived in them. His challenge to Matthews goes beyond scoring goals. It speaks to attitude, accountability, and taking ownership of the team’s trajectory. With Mitch Marner no longer in Toronto after his sign-and-trade move to the Vegas Golden Knights, the dynamics have shifted. Marner was a fixture in Toronto for nine seasons, and his absence continues to be a point of debate among fans and analysts.Versteeg wants Matthews to move past that conversation and become part of the solution. “So, why not part of the success, why not be a guy that get little big pissed off, put the team on your back and take them back and get yours out of the ditch,” he said. He pushed the point further with another line of emphasis: “For him (Matthews) to come in and play his best hockey ever, put the team on his back and start to show when he is engaged, when he is top of the game, he can carry a hockey club. ”Even with Marner still on the roster, Versteeg believes the deeper problem wouldn’t vanish. The Leafs are facing an identity issue that stretches across the ice sheet. What they need now is someone to seize the moment and make players believe again.Toronto’s season is far from over. The standings can still shift. The only question now is whether star player Auston Matthews will answer the call and lead the climb back into playoff contention.Also Read: Canucks goalie Kevin Lankinen suddenly steps away from team: Why his absence could reshape Vancouver’s season","Two-time Stanley Cup champion Kris Versteeg urges Auston Matthews to carry the Maple Leafs through turbulent Eastern Conference storm.

‘ Popcorn Kid ’ becomes instant Suns arena sensation



Sterling’s dad, Christopher, reacts to his son’s unexpected fame



A three-year-old fan named Sterling has turned a pair of Phoenix Suns games into viral moments after his shy stare at the Jumbotron sparked a wave of online affection. The toddler, now known nationwide as the “Popcorn Kid,” first caught fans’ attention during the Suns-Pacers matchup on November 13, when he peeked up from a bucket of popcorn bigger than his head and smiled at the camera. That video exploded online, topping 50 million views and transforming him into an overnight favorite among NBA fans.When Sterling returned to Mortgage Matchup Center for the Suns’ game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on November 21, the arena crowd welcomed him like a returning celebrity. The team leaned into the moment, placing him on the Jumbotron again as fans roared in recognition. It marked the second time in eight days that a simple courtside moment from the toddler managed to outshine the action on the floor.During his return appearance, the arena screens flashed a message reading, “Look who’s in the house,” before cutting to Sterling in his seat. This time, he was ready. The little fan had a soda cup in one hand, a giant popcorn bucket on his lap, and a confident wink for the camera.A game announcer hyped the moment, saying, “The cutie pie who won America’s hearts with a simple smile when attending his first Suns game... 50 million views across social media, please welcome back Sterling and his entire family!” The arena then erupted as every fan in his section received free popcorn.Sterling embraced the spotlight throughout the night. The Suns gifted him a jersey and a foam finger, and he made his way courtside for an up-close look at warmups. Fans recorded clips and posted them across social platforms, giving him yet another wave of viral attention.For Sterling’s father, Christopher, the whirlwind has been surreal. “We went to the game, went on vacation. And on our way home, we started getting text messages,” he said. “I don’t have any social media. So my wife had to create a TikTok account just to watch the video.”He said the reaction stunned their entire family. “And I mean, just everyone reaching out. ‘That’s you? That’s Sterling! That’s you. What’s going on?’ And so we still didn’t know what that really meant... So exciting, I think. Scary. Everything. But he’s been a champ. He’s been doing really well with it.”Christopher added that Sterling’s charm is nothing new. “It’s just like so natural,” he said, noting that the Suns’ hospitality made the experience even more meaningful. With five children, a smooth outing isn’t easy, but the warm welcome helped ease the chaos. He laughed as he thanked fans for their patience, saying some people had even endured popcorn being tossed their way.Also Read: Who was Jaiquawn Jay? 14-year-old student tragically passed away during basketball practice","Three-year-old fan named Sterling has turned a pair of Phoenix Suns games into viral moments.

Latest injury update on the popular Falcons wide receiver (Image Via Getty)

Drake London’s Week 13 chances and what the Falcons may decide

Drake London hurt his knee on Sunday, November 17, 2025, during the Atlanta Falcons game in Atlanta against the Carolina Panthers. After the game, head coach Raheem Morris said that tests showed a PCL sprain, and he called Drake London a “week-to-week” player. This means the team must check him every few days to see how he feels.The Falcons also lost their starting quarterback Michael Penix Jr., who suffered a partially torn ACL in the same game and has been ruled out for the rest of the season. This puts even more pressure on the team as they move toward Week 13, and fans want to know if Drake London will return on time.NFL Network reporter Tom Pelissero said on Monday, November 18, 2025, that Drake London’s PCL injury can be “tricky” and needs careful rest.He also explained that if the Falcons fall further in the playoff race, the team may use a safer plan and wait longer before bringing London back.Pelissero did not say it directly, but this could even mean holding him out for more than one game if needed.Raheem Morris also shared a clear update on Drake when he said, “You never know, Drake could come back tomorrow and feel a lot better, but we will see how his knee reacts.”His comment shows that the Atlanta Falcons are not sure yet, and they will watch Drake London closely this week.His Week 13 condition will be best indicated by the Atlanta Falcons' first injury report, which will be released on Wednesday in Atlanta.This year, Drake London has been among the most crucial players for the team. He was a vital element of the passing offense and had impressive stats before his injuries.Should Drake London not be ready for Week 13, the Atlanta Falcons could depend more on Kirk Cousins, Kyle Pitts, Bijan Robinson, and Darnell Mooney now without Michael Penix Jr.Drake London is not expected to play in Week 13 based on all the reports from Tom Pelissero and Raheem Morris unless he shows remarkable development really quickly. The team will wait, watch, and pick the most secure plan for him.Also Read: Madison Beer Opens Up About The Style Glow-Up She Discovered After Dating Justin Herbert","Drake London hurt his knee on Sunday, November 17, 2025, during the Atlanta Falcons game in Atlanta against the Carolina Panthers.

Caitlin further added, “And I remember like when I used to read books before I went to bed with my parents, that was the one I always wanted to pick. The resilience she had, that’s the whole story of the book. And what USA Women's soccer did for not only athletes but women in general and how they brought about people together. Like that’s just has been her ability, it’s just really to inspire people and to give back. And I don’t think I would be her if it wasn’t for them.” Clark credited all her career success to Mia and the USA Women’s soccer team.Mia was overwhelmed by listening to Clark’s statement. She responded to the clip, saying, “First and foremost, you see how sports kind of connect everyone, and I am very honored and humbled because I am a huge fan of hers.

NHL imposes fine on Detroit Red Wings' Ben Chiarot for attacking Simon Nemec

Also read:

Detroit Red Wings defenseman Ben Chiarot has landed in serious trouble, as the NHL has imposed a fine of $5K on the defenseman, the maximum allowed under the collective-bargaining agreement. It actually happened for attacking the New Jersey Devils’ young defenseman Simon Nemec with the butt-end of his hockey stick.The incident happened in Monday’s game when the Devils beat the Red Wings 4–3. The moment came late in the third period, just after a goal scored by the Red Wings’ centre Dylan Larkin. The two teams engaged in a scrum, and during that, Chiarot delivered the butt-end.Ben Chiarot’s performance this season has been good. Through 22 games, he has recorded 2 goals, 4 assists, 45 blocked shots, and 49 hits, along with a +5 rating. These numbers highlight his steady play as a shutdown defender who can also contribute occasionally on offense. But his recent controversy might create an issue for him.

The incident actually occurred during a scrum late in the third period of the Devils' 4-3 victory over the Red Wings on Monday.The moment came late in the third period, just after a goal scored by the Red Wings’ centre Dylan Larkin.For this incident, Ben Chiarot has to pay a $5,000 fine because he hit Simon Nemec with the end of his stick, which is called the “butt-ending,” during a game against the New Jersey Devils. This is considered a dangerous and illegal move, so the NHL has decided to penalize the Red Wings player for his misconduct.Initially, Chiarot was not issued a penalty for the play during the contest, while Nemec momentarily left for the dressing room in discomfort following the butt-head attack by Chiarot’s stick. Meanwhile, announcing the same, NHL Player Safety posted on X/Twitter that Detroit’s Ben Chiarot has been fined $5,000, the maximum allowable under the CBA, for butt-ending New Jersey’s Simon Nemec.”There has been no official statement about the same from the player’s side or the team. It seems that the Red Wings will turn their attention to their next game, coming up against the Nashville Predators on Wednesday.

Connor McDavid’s playing status in Dallas Stars at Edmonton Oilers





The Edmonton Oilers enter tonight’s matchup facing one of the Western Conference’s most structured squads in the Dallas Stars. As the Oilers try to strengthen their push for consistency, the major storyline centers around whether Connor McDavid will be available. His impact extends far beyond scoring. As his transition game, speed, and ability to dictate the pace can completely shift Edmonton’s offensive rhythm.Dallas, meanwhile, comes in with momentum of its own. Thus, relying on a disciplined system and strong defensive play. Facing an Oilers team that thrives on elite-level skill. The Stars could benefit greatly if McDavid is limited or unavailable. With both sides needing points, McDavid’s status becomes the central focal point ahead of puck drop.While Edmonton has yet to confirm McDavid’s final availability, the Oilers coaching staff has expressed optimism about his readiness. McDavid, who has been managing minor discomfort over the past week, participated in the morning skate with full contact. That participation suggests he is trending toward playing unless a last-minute setback occurs.If McDavid suits up, Edmonton gains a massive advantage in transition, power-play efficiency, and puck possession.His chemistry with Leon Draisaitl and Evan Bouchard has been a major catalyst in the Oilers’ offensive surge this season. Without him, the Oilers would need more depth contributions from Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Zach Hyman to compensate for the loss of elite playmaking.For Dallas, preparing for two versions of the Oilers, one with McDavid and one without, creates a major tactical difference. With McDavid active, the Stars’ defensive zone coverage must tighten around the slot. Without him, Dallas can deploy more aggressive forechecking and lean on their depth to dictate pace.Edmonton’s game plan hinges heavily on McDavid’s status, making his availability a defining storyline. Tonight’s clash could shift momentum for both teams in a tightly contested conference race.Also Read: NHL injury update: Charlie McAvoy ruled out as Boston Bruins face setback","Connor McDavid's playing status in Dallas Stars at Edmonton Oilers is a major storyline.

Former Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Jay Rosehill criticizes the team following disappointing results

Should The Maple Leafs Make A Coaching Change? | Real Kyper & Bourne

Also read:

Frustration around the Toronto Maple Leafs is reaching a boiling point, as prominent NHL analysts are calling for the organization to part ways with head coach Craig Berube amid a slump in performance. The Toronto Maple Leafs have no shortage of talent, experience, or expectations; however, somehow, the strategy for the game is not working.Speaking about the Maple Leafs’ situation, former Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Jay Rosehill delivered a scathing assessment of the team’s current mindset, accusing the roster of lacking pride, grit, and even the basic level of accountability he sees in youth hockey players. Let’s take a look at what the Maple Leafs defenseman had to say about his team.Former Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Jay Rosehill has heavily criticized the Maple Leafs for displaying disappointing efforts this season. Speaking during a recent media appearance, Rosehill said the Maple Leafs have shown little resilience during their latest stretch of disappointing results.Drawing from his experience coaching young athletes, he argued that even children learning the sport demonstrate more pushback and willingness to fight through adversity than the current Leafs lineup.Expressing his frustration, Rosehill said, “They’re so mentally weak, man.” Rosehill said. “Nobody’s inspired on that team… They don’t give the bare minimum, which I just can’t handle.” He also criticized multiple players for quitting on plays, avoiding responsibilities in critical moments, and failing to respond when games begin slipping away.Again, another NHL analyst has also shared his deepest concern for the team, and asked the team to part ways with the head coach Craig Berube. On The Justin Bourne Show, Justin Bourne expressed deep concern about Toronto’s miserable situation, questioning both the team’s management and leadership under head coach Craig Berube.He stated, ""I personally do think that a different coach would move the needle. I do not think he is a bad coach. I do think a different coach for this group would be great. I think, you know, a new voice and a new strategy, this game plan is not working here for this team. And I don't care how hard you press the try harder button, it's not going to work.""Meanwhile, Craig Berube was also out of answers when his team fell 5-2 to the rival Montreal Canadiens on Saturday night, losing for the seventh time in eight games, losing their Stanley Cup aspirations gradually.

He became the first player ever to win both the Hart Memorial Trophy (league MVP) and Art Ross Trophy (scoring title) while playing for two different teams in the same season.Beyond salary and other perks, Thornton’s on-ice accomplishments further shaped his legacy. With over 1,500 career points and more than 1,100 assists, he ranks among the NHL’s all-time leaders in both categories. His distinctive style of slowing the game down, controlling play from behind the net, and threading impossible passes made him one of the most influential centers of his generation. His leadership, charisma, and trademark beard only added to his iconic status.Internationally, Thornton has been a consistent presence for Team Canada, earning gold medals at the 2010 Winter Olympics, the 2004 World Cup, and the 1997 World Junior Championships. Even as he transitioned into late-career roles with the Toronto Maple Leafs and Florida Panthers, Thornton continued to showcase his passion, experience, and mentorship abilities. His reduced salaries during these final seasons did little to diminish the tremendous financial and cultural legacy he built.By the end of the year 2025, Joe Thornton’s $60 million net worth reflects not just his earnings but also a career defined by excellence, longevity, and the respect of the hockey world. As a future Hall of Famer, his legacy continues to shine long after his final NHL shift.Also Read: Joe Thornton officially joins San Jose Sharks as Player Development Coach","By 2025, Joe Thornton’s net worth is estimated at $60 million.

Kevin Durant’s fatherhood rumor sparks buzz

Kevin Durant’s private life in spotlight as fans react to new rumor

Houston Rockets remain unstoppable despite star player’s break

NBA star Kevin Durant will not be playing in the next two games for the Houston Rockets, the team has confirmed. The reason given is a family matter, and no further details have been shared yet. Durant’s absence has quickly become a major talking point among fans. Many supporters were also surprised by the announcement, which immediately sparked discussions across social media.The timing of his break has created even more interest among fans. The two games he will miss are against the Phoenix Suns and the Golden State Warriors, the two teams that he played for in the past. Because of this, some fans joked online that Durant might be trying to avoid facing his former franchises. But many also believe that something more serious could be happening.A well-known Suns radio reporter, John Gambadoro, mentioned on his show that someone told him that Durant might be becoming a father. However, he clearly said this is not his report, and it has not been confirmed by any major news outlets. So far, it remains only a rumor, and there is no proof that this is the reason behind his absence.“Bros sacred to face his own team,” one user wrote.“My heart skipped a beat I thought he got injured”, another added. “You people are weird asf, just hope that everything is good with his family, they are small and close family”, another one said. Fans all over social media are also worried and sending good wishes to Durant.NBA fans on social media have reacted with mixed opinions. Many do not believe the rumor, especially since Durant has stayed single for many years. His last known relationship was with Monica Wright, with whom he was engaged in 2013. They separated in 2014, and Durant has not shared details of his private life since then. Some fans still say he may have a private relationship, because athletes often keep their personal matters private and out of the public eye, leaving room for speculation among fans.The Houston Rockets are doing well this season, with a 10-4 record and sitting in the top four of the Western Conference. Even if they lose the upcoming games, the team probably won’t fall much in the rankings. Durant will surely be missed on the court, but the Rockets are confident they can continue to compete. And until the full reason for Durant’s break becomes clear, fans and media will have to wait. Whatever he is dealing with, the team and fans can only hope it is something positive, and not something worrying.Also Read: Kevin Durant shares a heartfelt shoutout to his hometown rapper after new music release","NBA star Kevin Durant will not be playing in the next two games for the Houston Rockets.

Donald Trump’s NFL commentary grows louder as the Giants falter and international diplomacy advances

President Donald Trump joined the bandwagon of fans expressing their disappointment over the New York Giants’ latest upset. The president spent his Sunday watching the Giants fall 34–27 to the Detroit Lions after a disastrous late-game decision. As New York slipped to 2–10, Trump used his Truth Social account to question why the team opted for a touchdown attempt instead of a game-securing field goal.The POTUS’s reaction added a political twist to one of Week 12’s most chaotic endings, coming at a time when his campaign has increasingly intersected with major sports moments. And with international negotiations unfolding in the background, Trump’s football commentary arrived as part of a whirlwind day that stretched from the gridiron to global diplomacy.Donald Trump’s postgame frustration mirrored the emotions inside the Giants’ own locker room, as he wrote. “Why did the New York Football Giants not kick that Field Goal???” via Truth Social, calling the decision “CRAZY!” Moments later, he doubled down, adding, “That’s Weird!!!” His critique targeted offensive coordinator Mike Kafka’s late-game aggression, a gamble that opened the door for Detroit to tie, then win, the matchup in overtime.Even injured rookie receiver Malik Nabers briefly echoed fans’ disbelief before deleting his own post, underscoring team-wide exasperation during a season spiralling out of reach. Trump’s weekend football engagement wasn’t limited to New York. He also praised Cleveland Browns rookie Shedeur Sanders, who became the franchise’s first quarterback since 1995 to win on debut.Declaring Sanders “GREAT” and adding his signature “I TOLD YOU SO,” Trump highlighted the QB’s rise after his surprising fall from first-round projections to a fifth-round draft pick. The president’s growing presence in football culture has expanded in recent months, from appearing on the Pat McAfee Show to attending a Washington Commanders home game as a guest of owner Josh Harris. He has even pushed for the team’s NorthWest Stadium to be renamed in his honour.But while Trump’s sports takes dominated headlines, diplomatic progress quietly advanced behind the scenes. Ukrainian officials signalled that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is preparing a visit to the United States to finalise negotiations aimed at ending the war. Rustem Umerov said, “At the earliest possible date in November to complete final steps and make a deal with President Trump”, as delegations continued discussions in Geneva and Abu Dhabi.Also read: Will D.J.

Mikko Rantanen’s playing status in Edmonton Oilers at Dallas Stars





The Dallas Stars approach tonight’s meeting with the Edmonton Oilers looking to maintain their strong position in the conference standings. With a balanced roster and one of the league’s most effective power plays. Dallas aims to exploit any defensive gaps the Oilers present. However, much of their offensive versatility. That depends on the availability of forward; Mikko Rantanen.Rantanen, one of the NHL’s most dynamic wingers. He has been central to Dallas’ scoring production this season. Even all for opposing teams. As the Stars prepare for the Oilers’ top-heavy attack, Rantanen’s presence becomes even more crucial in countering Edmonton’s offensive firepower.Rantanen’s status has been under watch after he sustained minor soreness during the Stars’ previous outing. While he joined team activities during morning practice, his workload was limited. The Dallas coaching staff indicated that a game-time decision is likely, as they want to avoid aggravating anything ahead of a heavy schedule stretch.If Rantanen plays, he immediately boosts the Stars’ top line, especially alongside Jason Robertson and Wyatt Johnston.His ability to control the pace on power plays and create passing lanes adds significant unpredictability to Dallas’ offensive schemes. Without him, the Stars must rely more heavily on depth scoring.Dallas operates one of the league’s most efficient power-play units, and Rantanen’s presence on the half-wall is essential. His puck distribution and ability to draw defenders open shooting lanes for teammates.His absence would shift responsibilities to secondary wingers, potentially reducing overall scoring pressure.For the Edmonton Oilers, Rantanen’s potential absence shifts defensive matchups. Edmonton can allocate more resources toward containing Jason Robertson. And focus on pushing pace through transition. However, if Rantanen plays, the Oilers’ defensive structure must stay disciplined, especially around the slot and boards where Rantanen thrives.Both teams understand tonight’s result may influence their wider playoff trajectory.Also Read: NHL injury update: Charlie McAvoy ruled out as Boston Bruins face setback","Mikko Rantanen’s status has been under watch after he sustained minor soreness during the Stars’ previous outing.

Kysre Gondrezick explains why she picks Caitlin Clark over Sue Bird



Angel Reese’s former Chicago Sky teammate, Kysre Gondrezick, has sparked a new round of debate in the basketball world. She openly backed Caitlin Clark over WNBA legend Sue Bird when asked who would win a hypothetical 1v1 duel. The former Sky guard appeared on “7 PM in Brooklyn,” a podcast hosted by Carmelo Anthony. When presented with the matchup, Gondrezick did not hesitate. Her response has since gone viral among WNBA fans.Gondrezick’s support for Clark has created a buzz because few would pick the young star over a four-time champion like Bird. Clark, known for her shooting and confidence, has become one of the most exciting players in the league. Still, choosing her over Bird, who has played 19 seasons for the Seattle Storm came as a shock! Gondrezick, however, explained her reasoning clearly and praised Clark’s scoring mentality.During the podcast, co-host Kazeem Famuyide asked Kysre Gondrezick who she would take in a 1v1 between Caitlin Clark and Sue Bird. Gondrezick answered instantly, “I’m taking Caitlin,” she said.She explained why she believes Clark has the edge.“The reason why I say Caitlin is that she is a scoring point guard. Sue has mastered being a facilitator, and she makes her shots when it is important. But Caitlin’s confidence. She comes off as ‘I’m shooting first,’ I’m taking her because of her scoring mentality, it comes instinctively for her”, Gondrezick said.Her comments surprised many fans, considering Bird is one of the greatest players in WNBA history. She averaged 11.7 points, 2.5 rebounds and 5.6 assists per game during her 19-year career. Yet Gondrezick still chose Clark for a scoring-focused scenario. She did, however, pick Diana Taurasi when asked about a similar matchup between Taurasi and Clark.Meanwhile, Clark and Angel Reese are set to join forces again. Both players were selected for the Team USA training camp roster. The camp will run from December 12 to 14 at Duke University. It includes 18 players such as Juju Watkins, Paige Bueckers, Cameron Brink, Aliyah Boston and Brittney Griner.Clark has been out of the game since July due to injuries but still managed to average 16.5 points and 8.8 assists in her sophomore season.Also Read: Caitlin Clark turns heads as she cheers for her boyfriend, Connor McCaffery’s team Butler Bulldogs, against South Carolina Gamecocks","Kysre Gondrezick appeared on a podcast hosted by Carmelo Anthony.

Surveillance footage and a restraining order add pressure on Gervonta Davis

New evidence appears to be building against boxing star Gervonta “Tank” Davis after serious allegations surfaced involving an ex-girlfriend. Surveillance video from a Miami strip club reportedly shows Davis forcefully removing the woman from the venue and dragging her by her hair. The footage was obtained through a subpoena and is now part of a civil lawsuit filed in Miami-Dade County. The case has already caused major consequences, including the cancellation of Davis’ planned exhibition fight with Jake Paul on November 14.The lawsuit accuses Davis of aggravated battery, false imprisonment, kidnapping, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. USA Today and MMA Junkie reviewed the incident report submitted by the club’s management, along with the surveillance footage collected by attorneys. According to the reports, the video captures disturbing moments inside Tootsie’s Cabaret, where the woman worked as a VIP waitress. The incident remains under police investigation as of November 24.The surveillance video reportedly shows a light-skinned Black man, later identified as Gervonta Davis, approaching the woman while she was working. He is seen grabbing her by the hair and forcing her toward a stairway that leads to the kitchen.In the incident report filed by Artagus Lane, a manager at Tootsie’s Cabaret, he detailed what he saw in the footage.He stated, ”[The woman] could be seen via camera footage begging for Mr Davis to stop. Once by the stairway, you can see Mr Davis grabbing [the woman] and pushing her by the head, and grabbing her hair in an aggressive manner [shaking it and pulling it back and forth], down the first flight of stairs.”Lane further added, ”[The woman] begged Mr Davis not to put his hands on her in front of the staff while walking through the kitchen. After they passed through the kitchen, Mr Davis continued being physical with [her] as she was trying to figure out a way to get away from him.”Reports say the woman managed to escape only after distracting Davis by asking him to retrieve her car keys from the valet. Police confirmed the case is still active, though no criminal charges have been filed.The woman has also secured a temporary restraining order against Davis. A hearing for a permanent injunction is set for December 9, after the earlier hearing on November 12 could not proceed because Davis was not served in time.Also Read: “Cover up, King!”- Fans go berserk as LeBron James nearly exposes himself in locker room after towel slip video explodes online","Surveillance footage and a restraining order add pressure on Gervonta Davis.

Hal Steinbrenner says the Los Angeles Dodgers’ spending and success are creating a gap

Hal Steinbrenner shared strong thoughts on Monday in New York after the Los Angeles Dodgers won the 2025 World Series in Toronto. The New York Yankees owner said the Dodgers look “far ahead” of other clubs because they keep winning and keep signing top players at every position. He said their roster of former MVPs, Cy Young winners, and young stars makes the talent gap very wide across Major League Baseball.Hal Steinbrenner also spoke about the Dodgers’ spending power. He said the Dodgers, valued at $6.9 billion by Forbes, spent heavily in the last two offseasons and turned that money into back-to-back championships. He said it feels like the Dodgers “are pulling away from the other 29 teams,” including his own New York Yankees.During his Monday interview in New York, Hal Steinbrenner praised the Los Angeles Dodgers for staying strong even after long injury spells during the 2025 season.He said the Dodgers “got healthy at the right time” and used their deep lineup to beat the Toronto Blue Jays in the 2025 Fall Classic held in Toronto.Hal Steinbrenner then shared why he is worried. He said, “Of course it’s a concern. They have tremendous resources, and they got the job done.”He added that the way the Dodgers keep adding major stars makes other teams feel like they cannot keep up.His comments also added to the common belief that the Dodgers are using money to keep winning championships.Even Dodgers manager Dave Roberts joked before the 2025 World Series began by saying, “Let’s ruin baseball.” His remark showed that the team knows people see them as the strongest financial force in MLB.Hal Steinbrenner was also asked on Monday why the New York Yankees plan to cut their payroll to around $300 million for the 2026 season.He said the club is barely making profits and that high spending does not always bring results. To explain this, he mentioned the New York Mets’ 2025 season, when the Mets had one of the biggest payrolls but still missed the playoffs.Hal Steinbrenner said, “There was nothing low about my payroll and the Mets’ payroll, and look where we ended up.” He said championships come when players perform well on the field, not only when teams spend more money.Also Read: Colorado Rockies Bet Big On Warren Schaeffer As Full-Time Manager After Disastrous 2025 Campaign",Hal Steinbrenner says the Los Angeles Dodgers' spending and success are creating a gap in MLB's talent gap.

Why the alarming FaZe Lacy-Ron encounters highlight growing security risks for IRL streamers





Twitch streamer Nick “FaZe Lacy” found himself in the middle of a confrontation with an unidentified woman who was allegedly stalking him on his November 24, 2025, livestream. It happened about four hours and forty minutes into the stream as he spotted the woman roaming his neighbourhood with a blue suitcase and two bags. It turned out that the same woman was repeatedly seen before in Stable Ronaldo’s IRL streams, exhibiting the same behavior.What followed was a tense, back-and-forth confrontation between Lacy and the woman, where the former questioned the lady’s weird behavior and sudden appearance at his house without any notice. There have been reports about the woman making wild claims about Ron, and this newest incident with Lacy also proved to be another, which was strange and almost eerie.Before the FaZe Lacy incident, the woman was allegedly the same individual who had followed Ronaldo through Hollywood during an IRL stream just one day earlier. Viewers claimed she approached strangers he interacted with on the street, allegedly telling them he was a “ra*ist” while going to the extent of calling herself his girlfriend. As soon as she turned up on Lacy’s stream, he immediately recognized her from the Ron fiasco.When the popular Twitch streamer pulled over and questioned her uninvited presence in his neighbourhood, the woman insisted she was leaving, while at the same time, criticizing the lack of proper security at his residence. Lacy was not one to hold back as he responded, saying, “What are you doing? Why are you… that’s weird. That’s actually weird. No one posted… Are you mentally ill?”The conversation turned even wilder and unsettling as the woman admitted that she had been kicked out of her house. She even made time to compliment Lacy’s look and his car, which all seemed out of place compared to the extremely odd situation they were in.The streamer further warned the woman that a boundary had been crossed and would be calling the cops if this unwanted behavior was to be repeated. Many well-known streamers, such as Valkyrae, Fuslie, and others, have specifically moved out of big recognizable houses to apartment complexes to avoid similar situations, with some even hiring armed protection and security.Also read: What really happened between FaZe Lacy and Valkyrae during Sisathon stream?

Dwyane Wade’s cryptic MJ–LeBron explanation leaves fans divided over the GOAT debate

The question that has been posed by fans, players, and the media for almost all of NBA history is that ""Who is the greatest player of all time?"" Now, recently, NBA legend Dwyane Wade, one of the greatest guards in basketball history, offered his opinion on the argument between Michael Jordan and LeBron James.The Miami Heat Hall of Famer made it obvious who his all-time favorites are, despite the fact that it is a subjective topic with no definite solution. The three-time champion listed his all-time favorite players, in no specific order, on his podcast, Time Out with Dwyane Wade. When asked to comment on the argument, he had an interesting reaction.Michael Jordan and LeBron James are two of the names most frequently brought up in the ""GOAT"" discussion. Now, D-Wade offered his thoughts on the entire discussion.However, in the recent appearance, he did it in a somewhat diplomatic manner. During the same, he said:""Michael Jordan is my basketball GOAT, mine personally, for all the reasons he should be. But I do have a new answer for how I'm gonna start answering this for when people ask me. I'm going to say Michael Jordan is the greatest player I've ever watched. He is the greatest player I've ever watched.LeBron James is the greatest player I've ever seen.""Wade had a close-up look at LeBron. With MJ, he never understood that. He has therefore chosen to categories them in a different way. He continued:“I never saw Michael Jordan.. I watched Michael Jordan. I saw and I've seen LeBron James up close. I played against and played with (James). I personally have not seen a greater basketball player, but I've watched a great basketball player.""Now, this diplomatic answer confused the fans who later took to X to express their opinion on the same.One said “pick a side ni**a.” Another user also urged him, “What? Man just pick one and call it a day bro.” Additionally, another one said, “the ultimate non-response..”Meanwhile, a fourth user said “translation: “MJ is the greatest player I’ve never played with, LBJ is the greatest player I’ve ever played with”, another one said, “Ni**a basically said LeBron is the greatest he ever PLAYED with. He won't say that though. Lol..” and a sixth user said, “translation: i didn't want to hurt Lebron's feelings by saying Jordan is the GOAT again..”Wade knows more about LeBron. Additionally, he never played with a better player. On the other hand, Wade, who was raised in Chicago, is also unable to leave Jordan. Hence, his answer left fans with more questions than answers.Also read: Dwyane Wade's wife Gabrielle Union honors Hollywood legend Diane Keaton after her shocking death, sharing powerful quotes","NBA legend Dwyane Wade weighed in on the debate over who is the greatest player of all time.

Toronto Maple Leafs captain Auston Matthews could return against Columbus Blue Jackets

Is There Too Much Pressure On Auston Matthews? | JD Bunkis Podcast

The Toronto Maple Leafs may soon see several key players back in the lineup, as forward Auston Matthews could possibly make a return to the team, amidst the Maple Leafs’ disappointing performance. It is also expected that he will be joined by Matthew Knies and Nicolas Roy all join to accompany the team on its upcoming five-game road trip. Auston Matthews took part in the Maple Leafs’ optional morning skate on Saturday, offering a positive sign in his recovery progress.Actually, he had been sidelined from the team following a lower-body injury against the Boston Bruins. Reports suggest that the Maple Leafs captain has 14 points (nine goals, five assists) in 17 games this season, whereas Matthew Knies has 22 points (five goals, 17 assists) in 19 games this season.As frustration around the Toronto Maple Leafs is reaching a boiling point due to their slump performance this season, the captain of the team, Auston Matthews , is preparing for his comeback to the team, after missing his 5th consecutive match. Though it has not been confirmed yet, Craig Berube has hinted that Matthews could take part in the match on Wednesday, against the Blue Jackets.Speaking about the possible return, the head coach of the Maple Leafs , Craig Berube, stated, “It’s good that they were out there and finished practice and went through all the drills.So yes, that’s where they’re at. So that means yes, maybe tomorrow.”During their absence, Toronto has struggled with both consistency and depth during the absence of multiple forwards. Due to their poor performance and disappointing results, an NHL analyst has also shared his deepest concern for the team, and asked the team to part ways with the head coach Craig Berube.On The Justin Bourne Show, Bourne expressed deep concern about Toronto’s trajectory, questioning the team’s resilience and its leadership under head coach Craig Berube.He stated, ""I personally do think that a different coach would move the needle. I do not think he is a bad coach. I do think a different coach for this group would be great. I think, you know, a new voice and a new strategy - this game plan is not working here for this team. And I don't care how hard you press the try harder button, it's not going to work.""Meanwhile, Craig Berube was also out of answers when his team fell 5-2 to the rival Montreal Canadiens on Saturday night, losing for the seventh time in eight games, losing their Stanley Cup aspirations gradually. Hopefully, the potential return of Matthews, Knies, and Roy will be a significant boost as the team starts a challenging road swing.",Toronto Maple Leafs captain Auston Matthews could return against Columbus Blue Jackets.

Most-Wanted Indian Gangsters Caught; Sangwan And Bishnoi Networks Face Big Setback in US, Georgia

JAIPUR: Inspired by a viral photograph of jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi wearing a striking black-and-orange jacket while being escorted to court, a new trend dubbed “Lawrence Jacket” has taken social media by storm across Rajasthan, drawing police’s attention.Kotputli-Behror police Tuesday arrested three men for selling replicas of the jacket in the local market. SP Devendra Kumar Bishnoi said Krishna alias Guddu Sharma, 38, Sanjay Saini, 31, and Sureshchand Sharma, 50, were caught selling 35 jackets with the gangster’s name at City Plaza in Kotputli town.Bishnoi said the arrests were made following directives from police headquarters to curb the glorification of criminals and gangsters. “Under the supervision of ASP Nazim Ali and Circle Officer Rajendra Kumar Burdak, the Kotputli team led by SHO Rajesh Kumar Sharma conducted raids after gathering intelligence on individuals selling jackets branded with Bishnoi’s name,” he said.According to sources, the photo that sparked the trend was reportedly taken around 2017–2018, during Bishnoi’s court appearance. The image resurfaced on Instagram recently, spawning an online trend of youngsters attempting to imitate the gangster’s style.Police officials said the trend was “dangerous” as it normalises crime and fuels fascination with gang culture. “We have in the past acted against social media users who glorify gangsters. This is how these criminal groups draw impressionable youth into their network,” said a senior police officer. Police have launched an inquiry to trace others involved in the sale or promotion of such items.",A photo of jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi wearing a striking black-and-orange jacket has taken social media by storm across Rajasthan.

Field for Candidates 2026

Russians Andrey Esipenko and Daniil Dubov, both playing under the FIDE flag, used to wish each other well just before the start of each game at Chess World Cup in Goa. Though Dubov’s strategy to leave the matches to tiebreaks back fired as he lost to Sam Shankland in the pre-quarterfinals, Esipenko will leave the country after accomplishing his mission.Despite losing to Wei Yi of China in the tiebreak of semi finals, 23-year-old and world No. 41 Esipenko managed to regroup himself and beat Nodirbek Yakubboev 2-0 in the classical phase of the third place playoff.The win ensured that Esipenko, who was a part of the 40-plus Russians who had written an open letter against Russia’s war on Ukraine, clinched the sixth of the eight slots for the Candidates tournament. The winner of that double round-robin event in Cyprus next March & April, will take on D Gukesh — most likely in November — for the world crown. It was heartbreak for Yakubboev as he lost out on Candidates after getting two clear shots at it. He lost first to compatriot Javokhir Sindarov in the semis.The Uzbek could spend only a week with his wife after getting married as he had to join the national camp. His mother accompanied him for this tournament. Despite probably putting his best foot forward, he would have to swallow the bitter pill. But he may take solace from the $50,000 won for this effort. Esipenko would bag $60,000Sindarov and Wei Yi extended their title clash to tie breaks of shorter time control after drawing the second of their two classical games.“I am happy,” said Esipen ko on the FIDE webcast. “This is probably the best moment of my chess career.”He said he was extremely exhausted after playing 30 games (including tiebreaks) in this knockout event. “I wanted it to be over finally.”He had faced a must-win situation in the second game of the classical phase against Pouya Idani of Iran in the third round and did that on demand. Esipenko, who became a GM at age 16 and touched Elo 2700 three years later, had shot into the limelight after he defeated Magnus Carlsen in the second rapid game of their 2021 World Cup pre-quarterfinals after losing the first. And though he went on to lose the next set of tiebreaks, he beat Carlsen at Wijk aan Zee earlier that year, their only faceoff so far in classical chess.No player has been able to oust Esipenko from the 18 World Cup matches in the classical phase across four editions starting with 2019. Esipenko lost out on an opportunity to qualify for the 2024 Candidates tournament after coming agonisingly close. He was the co-leader with just one round to go in the FIDE Grand Swiss. After uncorking a nice idea against Anish Giri in the last round, he forgot his preparation and lost.Esipenko had also lost the last round of the 2024 Aero flot Open despite leading it with a round to go. “I really had this problem with key games,” he said, “I am extremely happy that finally I played a good match when it mattered the most.”1. Fabiano Caruana (2024 FIDE circuit leader); 2. Anish Giri (2025 FIDE Grand Swiss winner); 3. Matthias Blubaum (2025 FIDE Grand Swiss runner-up); 4. Wei Yi (2025 World Cup finalist); 5.
