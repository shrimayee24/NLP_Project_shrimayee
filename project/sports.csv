Border-Gavaskar Trophy: 'India's greatest fast bowler...': Aussies in awe of Jasprit Bumrah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/indias-greatest-fast-bowler-aussies-in-awe-of-jasprit-bumrah/articleshow/116456214.cms,"We as a team are going through transition: Jasprit Bumrah

NEW DELHI: India's Jasprit Bumrah is considered one of cricket's best fast bowlers because of his ""slingshot"" delivery and capacity to disturb the best batters in the world.Overcoming career-threatening back issues, the 31-year-old became India's top Test wicket-taker in Australia on Wednesday, surpassing the great Kapil Dev In the third Test in Brisbane, Bumrah, who has been India's player of the series thus far, grabbed nine wickets to surpass Dev's previous record of 51 and reach 53 in Australia.Before the hosts tied the series in Adelaide, he was the player of the match in India's 295-run triumph in Perth in the first Test.With 21 wickets in the series thus far at an almost unbelievable average of 10.90, he is the most prolific bowler on both sides. With 14 dismissals apiece, Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc are next in line.""I think he is definitely India's greatest fast bowler,"" former Australia captain Ricky Ponting said of Bumrah.""In T20 cricket, one-day cricket and Test match cricket, he's clearly the best right now.""Travis Head, who has scored two hundreds and a fifty for Australia in the five-match series, went even farther.""Jasprit is probably going to go down as one of the greatest fast bowlers to play the game,"" said Head.On a bouncing Perth wicket, Bumrah, who was captaining the first Test in the absence of Rohit Sharma , made life miserable for the Australian batters.The hosts were dismissed for 104 after he took 5-30 from 18 overs. In the second innings, he added 3-42 to help India win by 295 runs.He can bowl yorkers whenever he wants and can release the ball late thanks to his unconventional front-on motion.Australia pacer Josh Hazlewood was astounded by Bumrah's unique approach, which he developed as a child while practicing in a little parking lot close to his family's Ahmedabad flat.""If you haven't faced him before, it can really unsettle you,"" Hazlewood said.""He lets the ball go way out in front, so he's pretty much half a yard quicker than what the actual speed gun says.""He's like a slingshot loading up and letting go.""Bumrah's match haul in Perth had some pundits questioning the legality of his deliveries, which appear to be bowled with a bent elbow.Australian great and former India coach Greg Chappell soon jumped to Bumrah's defence, describing the debate as ""nonsense"" and deeming Bumrah's action ""unequivocally clean"".After suffering a severe back injury that prevented him from playing in 2022 and 2023, Bumrah returned to the Indian squad last year.His contribution to India's June T20 World Cup victory in Barbados was crucial, as Rohit called his effort a ""masterclass"" for stopping South Africa from winning the final with 30 runs off the final 30 balls.His Indian Premier League team, the Mumbai Indians , where he has played for over ten years, is where the seeds of his brilliance were planted.When the Indians won the first of their five IPL titles in 2013, the pace bowler was recruited to Mumbai by former New Zealand batsman John Wright , who had scouted him from his native Gujarat.In his first game, Bumrah made an immediate impression by removing Virat Kohli , the standout batter for RCB.Head, who fell to Bumrah in Perth's second innings, claimed he enjoyed attempting to unravel the mystery of the mysterious bowler.""It's going to be nice to look back at your career and tell the grandkids that you faced him,"" he said.","Jasprit Bumrah becomes India's top Test wicket-taker in Australia, surpassing Kapil Dev. The 31-year-old has been India's player of the series in the five- match series. He is considered one of cricket's best fast bowlers because of his ""slingshot"" delivery.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116456131,imgsize-28520,width-400,resizemode-4/116456131.jpg"
How can India still qualify for 2025 WTC Final,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/how-can-india-still-qualify-for-2025-wtc-final/articleshow/116445406.cms,"(Pic Credit - X)

NEW DELHI: The Indian team still has a realistic chance of making it into the 2025 World Test Championship (WTC) Final despite the Gabba Test against Australia ending in a draw on Wednesday.Following the Brisbane draw, Team India, currently at third spot in WTC standings, must secure victories in both the remaining Tests of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy to guarantee their qualification into the Finale at Lord's irrespective of other outcomes.In the ongoing World Test Championship (WTC) cycle, four teams still maintain realistic chances of reaching the final, with one additional team holding a slim possibility. No team has yet secured their position in the top two spots, with eight Test matches remaining.Two wins in the remaining Border-Gavaskar Trophy Tests would elevate India to 60.53 percent, while with Australia's two losses (vs India) and two potential wins against Sri Lanka would take them to 57.02.If India attain one win and one draw, they would reach 57.02, allowing Australia to surpass them (58.77) with a 2-0 triumph in Sri Lanka.If India win the series 2-1, they would need Australia to defeat Sri Lanka by at least 1-0 margin, or forSouth Africa to lose at least 1-0 to Pakistan If the series ends in a 2-2 draw, India will finish with a percentage points of 55.26. In this case, for India to qualify for the WTC Final , Australia would need to lose to Sri Lanka by at least a 1-0 margin, or South Africa would need to lose 2-0 to Pakistan.If the series ends in a 1-1 draw, India will finish with a percentage points of 53.51. To qualify for the WTC Final, South Africa would need to lose both Tests to Pakistan, or Australia would need to lose 1-0 to Sri Lanka or draw the series 0-0. A 0-0 draw between Australia and Sri Lanka would leave both teams and India tied at 53.51%, but India would finish ahead due to having more series wins in this cycle (three compared to Australia’s two). However, if Sri Lanka win 2-0, they will surpass India and secure a spot in the final.If India lose the series 1-2, they will finish with a percentage points of 51.75, effectively ruling them out of contention for the World Test Championship (WTC) final. In such a scenario, Australia and South Africa will remain ahead of India in the standings, even if they lose all their remaining Tests. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka will climb to percentage points of 53.85 if they manage a 2-0 series win over Australia.","Team India must win both remaining Tests of Border-Gavaskar Trophy to guarantee qualification.

His hunger to ask tough questions fascinated me: Sunil Subramaniam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/his-hunger-to-ask-tough-questions-fascinated-me-sunil-subramaniam/articleshow/116455290.cms,"(

Sunil Subramaniam

, a former Tamil Nadu spinner with 285 first-class wickets and one of Ashwin's first coaches, spoke to Dwaipayan Datta)

The other day I was doing a show with the official broadcasters of the India-Australia series , and we were calculating the number of home games that Ravichandran Ashwin will get in the 2027 World Test Championship cycle. It was a good 11 Tests and a couple more in Sri Lanka and there was no reason to believe he wouldn't be there. This is a bolt from the blue - is his body giving him signals or is it some decision of the team management? I am intrigued.But I can't help going back to those afternoons at the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association academy, where I first met Ashwin - probably in the U-22 camp. I was taking baby steps as a coach after my career as a cricketer. TN, at that point, after the retirement of D Vasu, M Venkataramana and myself, were going through a phase where there weren't too many decent spinners.In that camp, this tall boy with long fingers really fascinated me. No, he wasn't the best spinner in that group, what I loved about Ashwin was his hunger to ask tough questions, not bothering the reputation of the person who was at the other end. I grew fond of Ashwin, at that phase he was still trying to figure out whether batting was his calling or spin bowling. I could see the spark, there was something in this boy that would make him a Tamil Nadu player for years to come. Over the next three years, our rapport grew stronger, I spent a lot of time with him discussing various aspects of the game as he was trying to find a footing at the top level.I remember a Duleep Trophy game at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in 2010, where Rahul Dravid was leading South Zone and Ashwin was not bowling well. Somebody called me to come to the ground to have a word with him and I asked Ashwin to come and meet me at the academy at the end of the day's play. He had bowled long spells, but when I put a mat with three lines and asked him to keep hitting the first line with the ball with a full run-up, he kept doing it for an hour. Mind it, this is after a day when he had already bowled 30 overs in the heat and humidity of Chennai!It was this minor adjustment of line that worked and in a year's time he was making his India debut. He invited me for the Test in New Delhi where he took nine wickets and was man of the match. For a very long time, my dream was to have a hand in making a bowler who would break Srinivas Venkataraghavan's record of being the highest wicket-taker from Tamil Nadu in Test cricket (156). I knew that very day, Ashwin would go way beyond Venky and the sky will be the limit.Ashwin hit a rough patch against England in the 2012 home series, when they just couldn't get Alastair Cook and Kevin Pietersen out. I watched him bowl and saw there were some problems with his bowling stride, it was getting bigger than necessary.We met and decided to have eight sessions together where he would bowl 108 deliveries in each session. He just worked on the basics, got his delivery stride right, and before the home series against Australia, my prediction was: ""Macha you will get at least 25 wickets."" Ashwin just laughed but ended up getting 29.Over the next few years, we drifted apart due to various reasons but then we did get to spend some time in the Indian dressing-room when I was manager between 2017-19.I remember the Southampton Test in the 2018 series after he bowled brilliantly in Birmingham (probably his best overseas spell). In Southampton he had an injury and didn't want to play but was convinced to play the game. Often, he couldn't complete his action and was taken for runs on a turner where Moeen Ali ran through India, and we lost the series.Later in the year, fitness issues bothered him in Australia too, where he missed the Sydney Test and Kuldeep Yadav got five wickets. I think if injuries didn't bother him, Ashwin would have done better in SENA countries, where he finished with 72 wickets from 26 Tests.But that doesn't take anything away from his greatness. I am back at the TNCA academy, and I hope I will get Ashwin's help from time to time in shaping a bowler who can go on to become the new Ashwin.",Ravichandran Ashwin is set to play 11 Tests for India in the 2027 World Test Championship cycle.

Watch: Virat Kohli tactically orchestrates Travis Head’s dismissal

NEW DELHI: In the third India vs Australia Test at the Gabba, former Indian captain Virat Kohli devised a perfect plan to dismiss the in-form Travis Head .The left-hander, fresh from scoring two centuries in the ongoing series, appeared confident, with Australia holding a 201-run lead on the fifth and final day.Australia's strategy was clear -- accelerate the scoring rate and force India to bat in the final session of the rain-affected day.Observing the situation, Kohli approached Mohammed Siraj with a tactical suggestion.“Bowl from over the wicket.” Rohit Sharma , initially hesitant, expressed his concern.“Bowling from over the wicket will make it easier for him to open his stance.”Kohli, confident in his approach, countered Rohit's apprehension. “Nahi, nahi. Over se agar scrambled waala dalega middle stump se toh out hone ka chance hai,” he said. (No, no. If he bowls scrambled seam from over the wicket, targeting middle stump, there’s a chance of getting him out.)Rohit agreed, recognising the logic in Kohli's reasoning.“He’s right.”Kohli further elaborated on his strategy, giving specific fielding instructions.“Set the square-leg fielder deeper for the in-swinger, and allow him to bowl at the stumps.”Rohit relayed the instructions to Siraj, emphasising the need for precision.“We need it on the stumps.”Head had just begun to settle in when Siraj executed the plan, bowling a short-pitched delivery aimed directly at the stumps. This left Head with limited options for an effective response.Attempting a pull shot, Head moved his front leg and swung across the line. The ball connected with the top edge of his bat, lofting high towards the gully region. Rishabh Pant , alert behind the stumps, called for the catch, positioned himself perfectly, and completed the dismissal.Head departed for 17 runs, his innings marked by a relatively modest strike rate of 89.47.Head was awarded Player of the Match for his magnificent 152 in Australia’s first innings. This followed another impressive century in the second Test victory in Adelaide.","Virat Kohli tactically orchestrates Travis Head’s dismissal in the third India vs Australia Test at the Gabba.

Taylor Swift Feels The Safest With Travis Kelce



Travis Kelce Has Upped The Security Of His Home For Taylor Swift



Taylor Swift is extremely concerned when it comes to her safety, which made her skip the Chiefs vs Browns game that happened yesterday as she only prefers to attend matches that happen at the Arrowhead Stadium, the home stadium of her boyfriend, Travis Kelce’s team. As per U.S. Sun, a source close to the couple has now revealed that Taylor is planning to move temporarily into Travis’ home in Kansas so that she can be with him as the team will enter playoffs next month.The source, according to U.S. Sun revealed, ""She will be going to Kansas City and staying there for some time during the next few weeks to be with Travis and show him love and support.”This is the same home of the Kansas City Chiefs’ tight end Travis Kelce that was burglarised in the month of October when Travis was away playing for his team, the Kansas City Chiefs. It was not just his home that was burglarised; his teammate and a close friend of his, Patrick Mahomes’ house was also burglarised just a few days later. Since then two more players’ in the NFL have been victims of such burglaries, this also includes the quarterback of the Cincinnati Bengals, Joe Burrow who recently suffered a home break in.Before this incident, as per many reports, a source close to Taylor and Travis had revealed that Taylor was pretty scared after one of her concerts in Vienna had to be cancelled because of a potential terror attack and now she only feels safe when she is with her boyfriend, the NFL star Travis. This also makes sense because now Taylor, who skips away games of the Kansas City Chiefs, is now planning to stay with Travis at his home that was burglarised just recently.Since Travis’ home was burglarised, according to various reports, Travis has put in extra effort to secure his home’s security especially so that Taylor can be at his home in peace. It seems like the burglary and the terror threat to Taylor’s concert has really shaken up the couple. Travis has used modern amenities to secure his home so that an incident like this does not repeat itself and Taylor as well as her belongings are all safe at Travis’ home.Also Read: Taylor Swift decides to miss the Browns game over safety concerns, continuing to attend Travis Kelce’s home games As per reports, Travis had reported valuables worth $100K were stolen from his house. Till now only one of his watches could be recovered by the authorities last month. There are no reports on what else could have been tracked by the authorities. The twin burglary was so shocking that both the NBA and NFL had to issue warnings to its players since it was revealed there were international criminal gangs working who were constantly tracking players through their social media.As Taylor moves into Travis’ home for the upcoming matches of the Kansas City Chiefs, it is just another sign that speaks about how much Taylor trusts Travis and how deep they are in love with each other. They have been together for more than a year now and it seems like their bond is just getting stronger everyday.This highlights the faith that Taylor has in her boyfriend that she is fully committed to supporting him as he prepares for his team to enter into the playoffs. Last season too Taylor took time out of her busy schedule and flew to be with Travis during the playoffs as well as attended the Super Bowl. However, now since she has wrapped up her legendary Eras Tour, so this season she has more time to give to Travis and she is leaving no stone unturned to support him, even if that means moving into a house that was recently burglarised.","Travis Kelce’s home was burglarised in the month of October when Travis was away playing for his team, the Kansas City Chiefs.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

Rohit Sharma press conference: On Ashwin, Gabba draw and his form

NEW DELHI: Indian skipper Rohit Sharma on Wednesday provided a key update on premium pacer Mohammed Shami ’s availability for the remaining two Tests against Australia. With two crucial matches remaining in the series, Shami's inclusion will surely strengthen India’s chances of clinching the series against the formidable Aussies.Speaking at a press conference after the drawn Gabba Test in Brisbane, Rohit categorically stated that it's high time someone from National Cricket Academy (NCA), where the ace pacer is undergoing rehabilitation after ankle surgery in November 2023, should talk about it as they are the ones who will give Shami green signal for the international cricket.""I think it's high time somebody from NCA talked about him. That's our national cricket academy where he is rehabbing. Those guys are the ones who need to come up and give us some kind of update. But look, I understand he's playing a lot of cricket back home, but there have been some complaints about his knee as well,"" Rohit said in the post-match press meet.""The last thing you want is the player coming here and then pulling out in the middle of the game. You know what happens when that kind of thing happens,"" Rohit quipped, referring to the disruption caused by mid-series injuries.Shami has been away from international cricket since participating in India's ODI World Cup Final in November 2023. His path back to competitive cricket has involved playing domestic tournaments.Following his surgery and comprehensive rehabilitation, the seasoned fast bowler resumed playing through the Ranji Trophy, and later delivered strong performances in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.The Indian cricket team's management remains cautious about Shami's return, insisting on definitive clearance from the NCA. Rohit emphasised that the team would only consider including him in the squad after receiving complete assurance regarding his fitness from the academy.""There's no way we want to take that chance unless we are like, not a hundred percent, 200 hundred percent sure. We're not going to take any risk. But yeah, like I said in the last press conference, the door is open.

The Chicago Bears ' 30-12 loss to the Minnesota Vikings has left their 2024 season hanging by a thread at 4-10. As frustrations grow, Bears players are speaking out.

With the defense struggling and his absence felt, Brisker’s frustration reflects the team's overall struggles.

As frustrations rise, Bears players are speaking out.

This isn't his first public frustration; after the previous loss to Minnesota, Brisker urged the team to “Got to tighten up. Not supposed to go like that.” But today’s message is sharper. He’s had enough. (via: EssentiallySports)The Bears have now lost twice to Minnesota, and it’s evident they miss Brisker’s presence on the field.

With just one target in the game, Kmet’s frustration is justified, as he’s been ignored in the offensive game plan, often targeted once or not at all.DJ Moore also voiced concerns, unsure if it's effort or execution holding the team back. Meanwhile, Caleb Williams, tied for the most sacks taken this season with 58, is feeling the heat. Troy Aikman called him a “defeated guy,” comparing his struggles to his own tough rookie year. While Williams hasn’t thrown an interception in eight games, his two fumbles in the last two weeks highlight deeper issues. The offensive line has failed to protect him, leaving him vulnerable.With three games left, Williams could end up second on the list for most sacks taken by a rookie, trailing only Bryce Young and David Carr. It’s a mess, but the Bears need to focus on execution to turn things around. If not, this season could end as just another disappointing chapter for Williams, the No. 1 pick.","The Chicago Bears lost 30-12 to the Minnesota Vikings on Monday night.

In Brisbane rain, an Ashwin googly...'My last day as an Indian cricketer': Spin stalwart R Ashwin chooses drawn Test to call end on a storied career

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

BRISBANE: India's campaign in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy was jolted by the shock retirement of spin stalwart Ravichandran Ashwin in the middle of the series here on Wednesday.With a couple of senior players in the sunset of their careers, the team has been staring at the difficult issue of transition for a while now. The process was eventually kickstarted in surprising manner here on a bleak day, even as rain pelted the ground and the third Test against Australia was drawn on the last day.The off-spinning allrounder walked in alongside captain Rohit Sharma after the game to announce his immediate retirement from all forms of international cricket at the age of 38. Ashwin will leave the team and depart for home on Thursday, captain Rohit Sharma said, with many left wondering at the manner of his retirement and the reasons behind announcing the decision now.""This will be my last day as an Indian cricketer in all formats at international level,"" Ashwin said, ""I do feel there is a bit of a punch left in me as a cricketer, but I'd like to showcase that in club-level cricket. I've had a lot of fun and created a lot of memories alongside Rohit and several of my other teammates. Even though I lost some of them over the last few years, we're the last bunch of OGs, if you can say that, left in the dressing room. I'll be marking this as my date of having played at this level.""It is understood that Ashwin has been contemplating retirement for well over a year now. A dodgy knee hasn't helped matters. The aches and pains and a deteriorating shoulder have been there for a while but India's 0-3 loss to New Zealand - and his own inability to prise out wickets on home turners like he used to - may have contributed to the decision. Washington Sundar getting the nod in Perth too may have been a red flag.Ashwin, the only Indian allrounder to score 3000 runs and take 500 wickets, did not take any questions after a brief statement, leaving Rohit to explain what had transpired. ""I heard this when I came to Perth."" Rohit explained. ""I was not there for the first three or four days of that Test. This was on his mind then. There are obviously a lot of things that went behind this. He understands what the team is thinking, what kind of combinations we are thinking.""Ashwin will be 39 by the time of India's next big home series and likely felt there was no point hanging on if the team had moved on from him. Rohit said he had to ""convince"" Ashwin to stay back and play the pink-ball Test in Adelaide, raising questions about why a proper farewell wasn't announced there itself, instead of the end of a rain hit Test in which Ashwin wasn't even a member of the playing XI.Ashwin is, after all, the second-highest Test wicket-taker for India behind Anil Kumble , the 537 scalps a testimony to his stature, commitment and rare ability. He brought a thorough, scientific, almost nerdy approach to the art of finger spin in his 14-year international career. He formed a deadly combination with Ravindra Jadeja which was the cornerstone of India's decade-long Test domination at home. The duo became a nightmare for visiting teams on the turning tracks in India.Overseas, Ashwin ceased to be a regular feature in the XI but ended with 154 away wickets. He was more than a handy batter, a role in which he began his cricketing journey and now leaves after scoring six Test tons.""When we came here, we were not sure about which spinner was going to play. We just wanted to assess what kind of conditions we get,"" Rohit said. ""When I arrived in Perth, this was a chat we had. I somehow convinced him to stay for that pink-ball Test. It just happened that he felt that 'if I'm not needed right now in the series, I'm better off saying goodbye to the game'.""Ashwin's decision deprives the squad of a major spinner for the remaining two Tests in Melbourne and Sydney, but Rohit was supportive of the decision. ""He was very sure about what he wanted to do. That is the kind of chat we have had as well, me and (head coach) Gautam Gambhir . It is important that a player like him, who has been a truly big match-winner, is allowed to make those decisions. If it was now, so be it.""This Australia tour has seen chief selector Ajit Agarkar staying back to consult with Gambhir and the captain on the way forward for the team. Ashwin's retirement may come as a message to some underperforming seniors to shape up. This is the second mid-series retirement for a top Indian cricketer on a tour of Australia, with then-captain MS Dhoni retiring after the Melbourne Test in the 2014-15 series.Debate will now rage on whether Ashwin was nudged or pushed, but there can be no questions on his legacy. He is one of the two greatest finger spinners of this era along with Australia's Nathan Lyon, with whom he had a long chat after the game. In India, the land of spin and great spinners, Ashwin will be feted till the game is played. As for Washington Sundar, he now has some very big boots to fill.",Ravichandran Ashwin retires from all forms of international cricket at the age of 38.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

NEW DELHI: Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka, the most successful bowler in cricket history, hailed fellow off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin of India on Wednesday for declaring his retirement from international cricket and referred to him as an inspiration for future players.After the third Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series between Australia and India ended in a draw in Brisbane on Wednesday, Ashwin announced his retirement from international cricket with 537 wickets in 106 Test matches.Ashwin hung up his boots as India's second-highest wicket-taker, after Anil Kumble (619), and Murali admitted it's no little accomplishment.""You must remember that Ashwin started his career as a batsman, dabbling in spin as a part-time option. He soon realised the writing was on the wall for his batting aspirations and shifted his focus to bowling. Hats off to him for making that bold pivot and achieving what he has. Reaching 500 Test wickets is no walk in the park,"" Muralitharan told Telecom Asia Sport (telecomasia.net) in an exclusive interview on Wednesday.Muralitharan, who retired from Test cricket after taking 800 wickets in 133 games, had seen Ashwin as a bright young player who was always willing to learn.""I was at the tail end of my career when he came onto the scene, but he struck me as an astute young man eager to learn. He sought advice, asked thoughtful questions, and put in hard work to better himself. That drive and hunger are what set him apart,"" Murali was quoted as saying by Telecom Asia Sport.Ashwin is the second most successful off-spinner after Murali and the seventh most successful bowler in Test history with 537 Test wickets.""To retire as India's second-highest wicket-taker in Tests is a monumental feat. Ashwin has made himself, Tamil Nadu cricket , and the entire nation proud. I wish him all the success in his second innings,"" said Murali.Murali was delighted by Ashwin's unwavering enthusiasm for learning.""Even as his career was winding down, his passion for learning never waned. Look at the variations he developed - proof that he wasn't content to rest on his laurels. He always kept pushing the envelope,"" said the Sri Lankan legend.",Muttiah Muralitharan hails fellow off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin of India.

WWE Universe Annoyed with Logan Paul Being Present on RAW Netflix Premiere

(This article highlights fan reactions from social media platforms. The views expressed belong to fans and not Times of India.)

WWE is set to make its way to Netflix on January 5, 2024, marking a massive shift in the audience and the global reception of the show put up by the company. The Stamford-based promotion has already announced a star-studded roster for the premiere show on Netflix, but fans are already unhappy with the presence of one particular wrestler for the event.The star in question is none other than Logan Paul, who also happens to be the former United States Champion. After losing his title to LA Knight earlier this year, he’s barely been on WWE programming, and there have been rumors that he won’t be returning to the ring anymore. However, the announcement by WWE has made it clear that he’s indeed associated with the company, at least for the time being. However, the WWE Universe hasn’t taken kindly to this announcement.Logan Paul is one of the few superstars who’s disliked heavily by the entirety of the WWE Universe. He’s comparatively a newer wrestler and hasn’t had any significant contribution to the world of professional wrestling either. So him being advertised for a show that is a massive landmark in the history of professional wrestling and for the Stamford-based promotion in general, is something that fans haven’t been able to accept yet.One fan commented, “Thought Logan retired,” while another commented, “ ‘Logan Paul’ okay man. Just happy to see Liv and Punk.” A third fan added, “Nobody gives a shit about Logan Paul. Can we please stop having to deal with him? I'm so over this waste of time.”These sentiments have been echoed by a lot of other fans on the announcement thread on X too. Some are also curious about Dominic Mysterio’s attendance at the event. A different fan stated, “No Dirty Dom, but there's Logan Paul???? make it make sense..only reason I still watch y'all cornballs is cause of Dom.”While WWE hasn’t explicitly stated that Dominic Mysterio will be present at the show, it’s understood that he will be there. Considering that Liv Morgan will be present that night, it’s a given that Dominic Mysterio will also be present there, along with Rhea Ripley.Also read: LA Knight to Remain Away from WWE Programming Following Lack of Clearance Other than these superstars, CM Punk is also expected to be present at the show. Given how his feud with Seth Rollins has heated up at this point in time, it’s no surprise that the two of them will end up throwing hands at the show, which could also be the main highlight of the night. The feud is extremely high profile, so having it present on the day of a big premiere is an absolute no brainer.","WWE is set to make its way to Netflix on January 5, 2024.

I could go back there and do that and help out. I really like coaching the next up-and-comers. It’s very rewarding to give my insight to them and have these different ideas that we can collaborate on to make the match even better. I really enjoyed that part and just being a part of the creative side. It was pretty cool.”ALSO READ: CM Punk Ready For Next Match: Can He Deliver a Holiday Classic?

Jesus hat-trick

London: Liverpool moved into the League Cup semi-finals as the holders won 2-1 against managerless Southampton , while Gabriel Jesus ended his goal drought with a hat-trick in Arsenal 's 3-2 victory over Crystal Palace on Wednesday.Rare goals from Darwin Nunez and Harvey Elliott at St Mary's sent the 10-time League Cup winners into the last four for a record 20th time.Held to a surprise 2-2 draw against Fulham in the Premier League last weekend, Liverpool got back on track with a 20th win from 24 games in all competitions under Arne Slot, who has lost just once since arriving from Feyenoord to replace Jurgen Klopp.Slot, who watched the quarter-final from the stands while he served a touchline suspension, opted to rest Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk as the Premier League leaders made eight changes.Liverpool's understudies were too strong for Southampton and Nunez ended his poor recent form with a clinical finish after Jan Bednarek made a hash of clearing Trent Alexander-Arnold's pass in the 24th minute.It was only Nunez's fourth goal in all competitions in a difficult season for the Uruguay striker, who had gone six games without scoring.Elliott doubled Liverpool's lead in the 32nd minute, drilling low past Alex McCarthy from 12 yards for his first goal this season.Cameron Archer reduced the deficit in the 59th minute with a superb curling strike from just inside the area.Southampton were furious when a late Jarell Quansah challenge on Mateus Fernandes didn't result in a penalty.But there was no escaping yet another defeat for Southampton in caretaker boss Simon Rusk's first game after Russell Martin was sacked following Sunday's 5-0 thrashing by Tottenham .""It was a very good and important win. We saw a lot of players that maybe don't start,"" Slot said.""We handled it really well and only conceded one or two chances. We have to defend the trophy because the club won it last season.""At the Emirates Stadium, Brazilian striker Jesus finally found the back of the net on home turf for the first time in 2024.Jesus' only previous goal in 20 appearances in all competitions this season had come against second-tier Preston in the League Cup.The 27-year-old's first goals in nine games were well-timed after Arsenal were booed off following Saturday's 0-0 draw against Everton in the Premier League.The Gunners, who last won the League Cup in 1993, are six points behind Liverpool and Mikel Arteta made eight changes as he prioritised Arsenal's rematch with Palace in the top flight on Saturday.Arteta's gamble paid off after an early shock when Jean-Philippe Mateta punished weak defending from Jakub Kiwior to put Palace ahead in the fourth minute.But Jesus equalised with a composed chipped finish in the 54th minute before lashing Arsenal in front after narrowly beating the offside trap in the 73rd minute.Jesus sealed his treble with another clinical effort in the 81st minute and former Arsenal striker Eddie Nketiah's header four minutes later came too late to save Palace.""Sometimes I have this problem with a lack of goals,"" Jesus said. ""I'm working a lot in training, finishing more, putting myself in a good position. I think my hard work has paid off.""Sandro Tonali scored twice as Newcastle beat Brentford 3-1 at St James' Park.Magpies boss Eddie Howe named a full-strength side and was rewarded with a comprehensive victory that moved his club a step closer to emulating their run to the 2023 final.Newcastle, who have not won a major trophy since the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, took the lead through Tonali's fine finish from the edge of the area in the ninth minute.The Italian midfielder netted again two minutes before half-time and Fabian Schar tapped in after 69 minutes.Yoane Wissa's stoppage-time strike was little consolation for Brentford.The last quarter-final sees Tottenham host Manchester United on Thursday.",Liverpool beat Southampton 2-1 to reach League Cup semi-finals.

When Jasprit Bumrah sparked bromance between Elon Musk and Sundar Pichai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/when-jasprit-bumrah-sparked-bromance-between-elon-musk-and-sundar-pichai/articleshow/116442679.cms,"Bumrah’s Mic-Drop Moment



But… Did Musk and Pichai Actually Play Cricket?



Cricket and tech don’t usually collide—unless, of course, you throw Jasprit Bumrah Sundar Pichai , and Elon Musk into the mix. Yes, the world’s deadliest yorker specialist somehow became the unexpected glue binding the Tesla overlord and the Google supremo in a delightful exchange on Twitter. And it all started with Bumrah wielding his bat like it was his third career option.During India’s gripping Test match against Australia in Brisbane, Bumrah, better known for rattling stumps than smashing runs, staged a heroic 39-run partnership with Akash Deep. This partnership, as thrilling as a last-over T20 finish, helped India avoid the dreaded follow-on. Twitter erupted in applause, but it was Sundar Pichai’s cheeky tweet that stole the show:""I did Google it :) anyone who can hook Cummins for a six knows how to bat! Well done @Jaspritbumrah93 saving the follow-on with Deep!""Enter Elon Musk, a man whose sporting inclinations so far seemed restricted to launching Tesla Roadsters into space. Musk, in his signature minimalist style, replied: “Nice.” And just like that, cricket entered Elon’s orbit.But Pichai wasn’t done yet. The man, clearly on a mission to baptize Musk into the cricket fandom , followed up with an invitation:""Gotta watch a SA-IND game one day at Newlands or Wanderers :)""Cue the internet losing its collective mind over the idea of Musk and Pichai chilling at a cricket match, sipping chai, and discussing googlies (both cricketing and quantum computing ones).This banter, however, has its roots in Bumrah’s legendary press conference earlier that day. When asked about his batting credentials, the fast bowler delivered a line so iconic it might as well be tattooed on every cricket fan’s heart:""Interesting question. I think you should use Google and see who’s got the most runs in an over in a Test match.""Absolute mic-drop moment. Of course, Bumrah ended it with “Jokes apart,” because, you know, humility and all that.Naturally, Google India couldn’t resist jumping on the bandwagon, tweeting: ""I only believe in Jassi Bhai ""For those unacquainted, “Jassi Bhai” is the nickname Bumrah’s teammates lovingly use for him. It gained fame thanks to Mohammad Siraj’s tearful admission after India’s T20 World Cup win in South Africa:""I knew only Jassi Bhai could do it for India.""Here’s where reality douses our fantasy. Sundar Pichai, Tamil Nadu’s finest export after filter coffee, undoubtedly played cricket in his youth. Musk, though? Not so much. Despite being from South Africa—a nation that eats, breathes, and sledges cricket—Musk’s childhood obsessions were more about coding and rockets than cover drives.So, no, the world hasn’t yet seen these two tech titans don cricket whites. But who knows? Maybe one day Musk will swap his Mars missions for mid-wicket musings, and Pichai will teach him how to hook a Cummins bouncer. Until then, we’ll just keep replaying this delightful Twitter banter on loop.Moral of the Story: Never underestimate the power of cricket—it can bowl over billionaires, unite continents, and even make Elon Musk go “Nice.”","Jasprit Bumrah and Google CEO Sundar Pichai tweet about cricket.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

Did rejection hurt him so bad that he couldn't take it anymore? This question has left the Indian cricket world in a tizzy as R Ashwin - India's second highest Test wicket-taker - announced his shock retirement from international cricket on a rain-soaked Tuesday afternoon in Brisbane.This wasn't in the script for the 537-wicket man. It wasn't too long ago that Ashwin had said he would retire the day he goes past Anil Kumble 's record of 619 Test wickets. Over the years, he had accepted the fact that Ravindra Jadeja would play ahead of him in overseas Tests because of the latter's spunk with the bat. But was being downgraded to the No. 2 off-spinner in a touring party behind Washington Sundar the last straw?Rejections are something Ashwin had learnt to live with as a young cricketer. He was still learning the ropes when he was rejected midway through a trial match at the India Pistons ground in Chennai. The coach told him he need not turn up for the second day of the game.Then, during his first year as a Chennai Super Kings player, an official told him to vacate the team hotel and not come back, till he was recalled.At that point it did hurt, but it didn't break Ashwin. ""Believe me, there is nobody in this world who will tell you he has not been rejected - be it Sachin Tendulkar or Don Bradman - they've all faced rejections. As for me, facing rejections was the biggest learning curve I had, I have embraced it and tried to learn from it,"" Ashwin told TOI during a recent interview.It was probably a deep conviction in his craft that helped Ashwin soldier on for so long. A slightly confused teenager who wasn't sure whether he would become a batter or a pace bowler, ended up becoming a spinner when a back injury almost finished his playing career.""I don't know if I am an accidental spinner. But honestly, I think whatever happened, happened for the right reasons. Maybe this was my destiny, and I just had all these things that had to happen so that I could turn into a spinner,"" Ashwin said.For the offie, spin bowling became an ""expression of an art form"". He treated it ""like a software that continuously needed upgradation"".While those tireless hours of working on the stock-ball - the off-break - always remained, his love of experimentation grew. One of the first from his armoury was the carrom ball in 2010, a mystery weapon that Sri Lankan spinner Ajantha Mendis had used against India two years earlier. ""I had seen Ajantha in a camp in Chennai when he was nowhere close to the national team. He was bowling that delivery and pitching it with the same incredible regularity that we used to try in street cricket and fail. I parked that idea in me and when I saw Ajantha doing it for Lanka, I knew I had to try it,"" Ashwin said.That was the willingness of a boy in his early 20s to learn new things. But even as he grew older, Ashwin had to come up with new tricks without compromising on his primary weapon, the off break. There were rough patches along the way. In 2013, sections of the media started calling him ""the scientist"" when things didn't go his way.""I have a creative side, a deep-thinking side to me. And sometimes when I want to share those stuff and talk about it to people, you don't often find synergies. So sometimes I felt that's been a stumbling block and people have misunderstood me for that,"" Ashwin tried to explain his tendency to polarize opinion over the years.But that never stopped him from becoming one of India's greatest match-winners, especially at home. Making the most of spin-friendly conditions, his partnership with Ravindra Jadeja has yielded an incredible 856 Test wickets, making them one of the most lethal duos of all time.""I am jealous of his abilities but totally admire him. I have learnt to admire him for the last 4-5 years… Sometimes when you are in the race along with your co-cricketers, you want to get ahead of one another even inside a team. It's like brothers going up in arms. And then you slowly start admiring one another. That admiration has gone one step higher, knowing that I can never beat Jadeja. I am comfortable in my skin but totally inspired by what he has done,"" was how Ashwin explained his admiration for a man who often kept him out of the Indian XI on international assignments, even for one last time in Brisbane.",Ravichandran Ashwin announced retirement from Test cricket on Tuesday. Ashwin was India's second highest wicket-taker with 537 Test wickets. He had said he would retire the day he goes past Anil Kumble's record of 619 Testickets.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116455088,imgsize-48418,width-400,resizemode-4/116455088.jpg"

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

Rohit Sharma press conference: On Ashwin, Gabba draw and his form

Former India captain and batting legend Sunil Gavaskar has disagreed with the timing of Ravichandran Ashwin 's announcement about his retirement, saying that ""it leaves you one (player) short"" in the middle of an important series.Ashwin has decided to quit international cricket with immediate effect, while he will remain available to play club-level cricket and is scheduled to feature in the 2025 season of the Indian Premier League.Ashwin, who ended his career with 537 Test wickets, played the pink-ball Test in Adelaide but was dropped from the eleven for the third Test in Brisbane, which ended in a draw on Friday, leaving the five-Test Border Gavaskar Trophy still level at 1-1.""He could have said, 'Listen, after the end of the series, I won't be available for selection for India'. What it does is that, similarly when MS Dhoni retired at the end of the third Test in the 2014-15 series, it leaves you one (player) short,"" Gavaskar said while talking on live broadcast.""Normally, you tend to look at the end of the series (to retire). That's it. In the middle, it is not usual,"" he added.""The selection committee has picked so many players for a tour with a purpose. If there are any injuries, they can select from the reserve players to have in the team. So Sydney (venue for the fifth Test) is somewhere where there is a lot of support on offer for spinners. So India could have played with two spinners. You never know, he (Ashwin) could have been there for sure. I don't know how the pitch in Melbourne (venue of fourth Test) will be like.""The other off-spinner in India's squad is Washington Sundar, who played the first Test in Perth and, like Ashwin, is a handy batter lower down the order.""Maybe Washington Sundar is ahead of him (as preferred off-spinner),"" said Gavaskar. ""Rohit mentioned that he (Ashwin) is flying out tomorrow. So this marks the end of Ashwin as an international cricketer. He has been one heck of a cricketer.""",Ravichandran Ashwin retires from international cricket with immediate effect. Ashwin will remain available to play club-level cricket and is scheduled to feature in the 2025 season of the Indian Premier League.

'Anxious' Ancelotti makes more history

Doha: Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior both scored as Real Madrid cruised to a 3-0 victory over Mexican side Pachuca in the Intercontinental Cup final in Doha on Wednesday.Mbappe opened the scoring in the 37th minute before Rodrygo doubled Madrid's lead early in the second half. Vinicius sealed a comfortable win for the Spanish and European champions with a late penalty.France striker Mbappe returned to the Madrid line-up in Doha after missing Saturday's 3-3 draw with Rayo Vallecano due to a hamstring injury suffered in the Champions League win at Atalanta last week.Mbappe swept in from close range to break the deadlock after brilliant play from Vinicius Junior, who won the FIFA Best men's player of the year award a day earlier after missing out on the Ballon d'Or Former West Brom and Newcastle forward Salomon Rondon led the attack for CONCACAF Champions Cup winners Pachuca, but they never truly looked capable of an upset and Rodrygo's fine curling strike from the edge of the area put Madrid in total control.It was allowed to stand after the referee consulted the pitchside monitor even though Jude Bellingham was in an offside position and appeared to be interfering with the goalkeeper's line of vision.Vinicius added a third from the penalty spot six minutes from time following another VAR review after Lucas Vazquez was chopped down in the Pachuca box.""We knew that after a long trip and playing just one game it's hard. We struggled at the beginning, but we adapted well,"" Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde told Spanish television channel Telecinco.It is Madrid's second title of the season following their UEFA Super Cup triumph over Atalanta in August, a welcome boost after what coach Carlo Ancelotti admitted had been a difficult period.""In this part of the season I was a bit anxious because I didn't like the team, honestly, but this will change in 2025 I'm sure,"" said Ancelotti.""It's important for us to get to Christmas alive. If we think about the team after the defeat by Milan (in the Champions League on November 5), I think we've grown a lot and that gives us confidence for 2025.""Ancelotti won his 15th trophy as Madrid coach, moving him past Miguel Munoz for the most in the club's history.""It's a nice moment. It's an honour for me.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

Rohit Sharma press conference: On Ashwin, Gabba draw and his form

BRISBANE: The announcement was made. R Ashwin was no longer going to be an India cricketer and as the whole of India reacted to the shocking retirement, there was this stormy calm at The Gabba . The drizzle continued and the floodlights were still on as the broadcast crew worked in overdrive to safely pack their equipment before calling it a day. Both teams had left the venue, most gates were shut but there was a large goods vehicle parked close to gate No. 6.Three stockily built gentlemen were doing the heavy lifting and loading the kitbags of Indian cricketers into the truck. It's a usual practice to send the kits and other heavy equipment before the team departs to their next destination but the cargo will now be a bag less as Ashwin's gear will be directed to Chennai instead of Melbourne.The warm hug with Virat Kohli in the change room had fuelled speculation before India's greatest off-spinner dropped the bombshell at the post-match press-conference. Known for his meticulous ways of going about things, it was a rather snap announcement by Ashwin who had his captain and long-time teammate Rohit Sharma by his side.""I am not going to take too much of your time. This will be my last year as an Indian cricketer in all formats at the international level. I do feel there is a bit of punch left in me as a cricketer but I would like to expose and probably showcase that in club level cricket but this will be the last day,"" came the announcement.No excessive use of words or adjectives and the 38-year-old called time on his international career spanning over 15 years. He remembered his teammates, the ""last bunch of OGs"", Rohit, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane and Cheteshwar Pujara and thanked them for taking those catches in close-in positions.""There are a lot of people to thank but I would be failing in my duties if I didn't thank the BCCI and the fellow team mates. I want to name a few of them. All the coaches who have been a part of the journey, most importantly Rohit, Virat, Ajinkya, Pujara who have taken those splendid catches around the bag to give me the number of wickets I have managed to get over the years,"" he added with the wit still intact.Ashwin, who played one of the three Tests in the series, didn't stay in the media room for more than a few minutes and made his way out to a rapturous applause. The announcement was snap, the news came as a shocker but the great man had it all figured in his head during the first Test in Perth. Jasprit Bumrah was the stand-in captain for that game but the moment Rohit arrived, Ashwin broke the news to his captain and it was only after a lot of convincing that he agreed to play the Adelaide fixture.""I heard this when I came to Perth. Obviously I was not there for the first three or four days of the Test match, but this was in his mind since then. There are obviously a lot of things that went behind it. I am pretty sure Ash when in position will be able to answer that.""But he understands what the team is thinking, he understands what kind of combinations we are thinking and you know when we came here as well we were not sure about which spinner is going to play... we just wanted to assess and see what kind of conditions we get in front of us but yeah when I arrived in Perth, this was a chat we had and I somehow convinced him to stay for that pink ball Test,"" reveals Rohit.In the lone outing with the ball, the offie sent down 18 overs and returned with the solitary wicket of Mitchell Marsh. There was a handy contribution with the bat in the first innings, too, but not many would have guessed that this was going to be his last appearance for the Indian cricket team.Who would have thought that the kitbag which landed on Australian soil in Perth would be doing a mid-series re-route from Brisbane to Chennai, instead of Brisbane-Melbourne-Sydney-Chennai.In a snap of a finger, the professor of spin bowling, one of India's greatest match-winners in Tests, the quintessential team man and an asset for every captain left with a question on every lip: Why now?","R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket.

NEW DELHI: Legendary Sunil Gavaskar voiced his anger over the shot selection of Shubman Gill in the first innings of the third Test in Brisbane on Monday. The former India captain urged Gill to ‘leave your image in the dressing room’ and put the fancy shots in his 'back pocket'.Gill chased a delivery outside off stump, playing it away from his body, resulting in an outside edge. Mitchell Marsh pulled off a brilliant catch at gully off Mitchell Starc's bowling.""Leave your image in the dressing room,"" Gavaskar said on Star Sports.""Certain shots are dangerous at the start of your innings before you are set, and you don't have the measure of what the wicket is doing. Keep all those shots in your back pocket. Take them out when you are 30-40-50 not out, then can you get those shots again,"" Gavaskar said.""Not very good shot selection, you could say. It was a very good catch, so there was a little bit of bad luck as well over there. But he could have left that ball alone; it would have gone harmlessly to the wicketkeeper,"" he further added.Gavaskar also urged Virat Kohli to take inspiration from Sachin Tendulkar 's iconic 241 against Australia in Sydney in 2004, advising him to avoid playing the cover drive to overcome his ongoing struggles with deliveries outside the off-stump.""He (Kohli) only needs to look at his hero, Sachin Tendulkar.

In the high-pressure crucible of the World Chess Championship , it wasn’t just the brilliance of D Gukesh ’s moves that left an indelible mark – it was his unwavering poise under tense situations that etched an unforgettable impression. The 18-year-old prodigy played not only with his mind but also with his heart, fighting every battle as though the board was a stage and he, the lead actor in a drama of unyielding resolve.Yet, it was his demeanour, as much as his daring, that caught the attention of those who observed him up close. Aleksandar Colovic, the Fair Play Officer of the blue-ribbon event tasked with ensuring the tournament’s integrity, noted that his job was made easier because of how well-behaved both Gukesh and former champion Ding Liren were.“They are very similar in many ways – both cultured and well-mannered. They both shook their legs when nervous, but in different ways. They were also very cooperative and kind. True gentlemen,” Aleksandar told TOI.In a world where chess geniuses often arrive wrapped in eccentricity, the Chennai teen has stood apart. Even in moments of extreme pressure, Gukesh maintained an aura of focus. Aleksandar, who observed every move with the precision of a hawk, quickly identified the quality that set Gukesh apart.“Actually, I was really impressed by Gukesh’s constant desire to put up a fight. I think Garry Kasparov or someone had said, ‘In a match between two players, the fighter always wins.’ Gukesh was the better fighter in this tournament. If you look at the games, when Ding was playing with the white pieces, he often avoided a fight. He wanted to be safe – wanted a draw.""But Gukesh wasn’t doing that. He took it to the extreme, avoiding a draw even in positions where he was objectively worse. This characteristic of being a true fighter, not shying away from a challenge, was the main difference that decided the champion,” said Aleksandar, a seasoned Fair Play Officer with extensive experience in events like the Grand Prix and the Candidates Tournament.After the victory, Gukesh praised his 32-year-old opponent, calling him a “true champion” and expressing his admiration. “I would also love to thank my opponent, Ding Liren. He is, in my eyes, a true champion, and we saw that despite a lot of pressure on him, he was able to put up a huge fight. I really admire you,” Gukesh said during the closing ceremony. This graciousness, especially at just 18, added to the impression of a young champion defined not only by his moves but also by his character.Meanwhile, Russian Chess Federation president Andrei Filatov has questioned the way Ding lost to Gukesh, calling for an investigation by FIDE . In response, Aleksandar remarked, “That blunder didn’t come out of nowhere. I mean, this was a long, gruelling game where Gukesh was pressing and pushing, while Ding just wanted the game to end. He was a few moves away, thinking nothing could go wrong, but then he messed up. After almost a month of constant pressure, people crack. That’s normal.”The officer’s role in the tournament was both challenging and rewarding, especially in an era where technology has blurred the lines of fair play. “Players were scanned before entering the play area, passing through different types of scanners to ensure they didn’t have any devices on them or their body. I also ensured no signals entered the glass cube. I really enjoyed it. I knew that maybe I’m becoming part of history here,” Aleksandar explained.","D Gukesh beat Ding Liren to win the World Chess Championship.

KL Rahul Press Conference

We as a team are going through transition: Jasprit Bumrah

India skipper Rohit Sharma 's struggle for runs has continued in Australia, and batting legend Sunil Gavaskar believes that Rohit may decide to step down as captain if runs continue to elude him in the last two matches of the Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) in Melbourne and Sydney.Speaking on ABC Sport, Gavaskar said Rohit won't leave it to the BCCI selectors to take that call.""I think Rohit obviously will get the opportunity to play in the next couple of matches, that's for sure. But maybe at the end of it, if he hasn't scored runs, my feeling is that he himself will take the call,"" said Gavaskar.Rohit has batted in the middle order so far in this series after joining the team from the second Test onwards and allowed KL Rahul to open as he had rediscovered his form at the top of the order.The skipper has been struggling ever since the Test series at home against New Zealand and Bangladesh before his arrival in Australia. Against Bangladesh, Rohit aggregated just 42 runs in four innings and against New Zealand 91 runs in six innings.In the ongoing BGT, his knocks so far read 3, 6, and 10.""He's a very conscientious cricketer, he will not want to be a burden on the team,"" Gavaskar continued. ""He's a cricketer who cares very deeply for Indian cricket . So if he doesn't score runs in the next couple of games, I think he himself will step down.""India's Test specialist Cheteshwar Pujara, who was part of the Indian team that won its last two series in Australia, said Rohit has put himself in self-doubt by not playing in position, i.e. an opener, where he is the most comfortable.""He has been opening the innings, now he's batting at number 6 (in Australia). That is for the team, but I still feel that when you are so much used to opening the innings and when you have to wait, then you put yourself in that doubt.

Christmas came early to the Indian dressing room on Tuesday at the Gabba , which witnessed euphoric scenes minutes before close of play on day four of the third Test in Brisbane . India legends Virat Kohli , captain Rohit Sharma and chief coach Gautam Gambhir erupted in joy as soon as Akash Deep hit the boundary that ensured the visitors have saved the follow-on and potentially the third Test as well.An unbeaten 39-run partnership of 54 balls for the last wicket between Akash Deep (27*) and Jasprit Bumrah (10*) helped India go past the follow-on target of 246 to finish day four at 252 for 9. Although India still trail the home team's total of 445 by 193 runs, saving the follow-on has almost decisively moved the match towards a draw as Australia will have to bat now in their second innings on day five.But the scenes that went viral on Tuesday were of Kohli, Rohit and Gambhir doing the high fives and laughing heartily to watch Bumrah and Akash destroying Australia's hopes. The ninth wicket fell at the score of 213, when Jadeja was dismissed for a possibly match-saving knock of 77.The most important play of day four came in the last hour. At one stage where Australia were hoping that they could dismiss India, enforce the follow-on and bowl a few overs at the Indian openers before close of play, the visitors went to stumps with still a wicket in hand -- thanks to Bumrah, Akash and Jadeja.KL Rahul remains the top-scorer of India's first innings with his knock of 84.Both Bumrah and Akash showed exemplary display of copybook defence and game-awareness to milk the Australian bowlers with ones and twos and move closer to the follow-on target of 246. Once that was achieved, Akash showed his long-handle skills by hitting Pat Cummins for a six over mid-wicket.The shot brought Kohli on his feet as he ran right up to the glass window at the edge of the dressing room to see how far the ball travelled, while the rest of his teammates applauded with wide smiles on their faces.The importance of this match-saving act is such that it can potentially turn into a turning point in the series that will next move to Melbourne and then to Sydney for the concluding Test -- two venues that should favour the Indian batters more than Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane.","Akash Deep (27) and Jasprit Bumrah (10) help India go past the follow-on target of 246.

NEW DELHI: The fifth day of the third Test between India and Australia in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy at The Gabba in Brisbane got underway on schedule.The day's proceedings started with Australia captain Pat Cummins completing his unfinished over from Day 4. Only 4.5 overs were possible after that as India were bowled out for 260 runs in their first innings and Australia's second innings was delayed due to lightning and rain. Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep , who had starred for India in avoiding the follow-on on Day 4, put up a defiant 47-run stand for the last wicket.But a funny moment came in Nathan Lyon 's second over of the day when Akash Deep played on a delivery on to his pads and the ball stuck there.Travis Head , fielding at forward short leg, came forward to collect the ball from Akash Deep who had taken it out from his pads.But Akash Deep just dropped the ball on the ground in front of Head leaving the Aussie puzzled and irritated at the same time.Akash Deep, realizing his mistake, then said ""sorry sorry"" to invoke a laugh not only from the commentators but also a wry smile from Head.In the next over, Head had Akash Deep stumped by Alex Carey as Australia took a 185-run lead.",The fifth day of the third Test between India and Australia at The Gabba in Brisbane got underway on schedule.

We as a team are going through transition: Jasprit Bumrah

Virat Kohli during the net session.

BRISBANE: The sun was out in its full glory and it was a very hot morning in Brisbane before Day 4 got underway. The forecast apps had maintained consensus on rain but the morning didn't suggest that the day would be headed in that direction. As the handful of spectators made their way to The Gabba, there was a lot of noise coming from the nets area. Few Indian training jerseys were spotted from the main junction but the moment one got closer, the cast of the session was revealed.With the training tank top on, Virat Kohli was in the nets and faced a lot of deliveries from Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar and the throwdown specialists. The India batter kept switching nets for small hits against different attacks as he looked to iron out the flaws which have been leading to his downfalls in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy .In the first innings at Gabba, the right-hander was out nicking at a delivery well outside the off-stump and chatter of his vulnerabilities in that channel only grew louder. So, here he was, on the morning of the fourth day, sweating out as few spectators observed proceedings from a higher elevation and some were stationed right behind the net. Bowling coach Morne Morkel and assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate were also present to assist Kohli, who also had Devdutt Padikkal batting in the adjacent net.There were drives, plenty of them, during the session and the former captain was comfortably shouldering arms to deliveries on length. Every time he would miscue the drive or shot, Kohli would speak to the throwdown specialist or the bowler and the interactions continued throughout his session.It will be safe to say that he looked assured and solid during that hit before the morning session got underway but the touch of the nets hasn't translated into match form during his recent outings. He scored a hundred in the second innings of the Perth Test but has been dismissed in single digits in three out of the four other innings in the series.There is still a lot of cricket left in the series and India's prolific batter would hope he gets his act right for the next two fixtures in Melbourne and Sydney. And even in the second innings in Brisbane, if weather permits.","Virat Kohli faced a lot of deliveries from Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar and the throwdown specialists.

Brief Scores:

MUMBAI: The Harris Shield final between Anjuman-I-Islam Allana School and Modern English, Chembur, at the Brabourne Stadium produced a thrilling match which resulted in the first-ever tie in the summit clash in the 128-year-old history of the tournament.However, a controversy broke out after the organisers, Mumbai Schools Sports Association (MSSA), declared Anjuman as the winners on the basis of their four-run first innings lead.In the first innings, Anjuman scored 267 while Modern English got 263 for eight in 80 overs. In the second innings, Anjuman were bowled out for 203 in 38.3 overs. In reply, Modern finished at 207 for six in 40 overs to tie the scores.The organisers' decision to declare Anjuman as the champions wasn't accepted by the umpires of the final and Modern English coach Subramanian Doraiswamy, a former Mumbai first-class player.The umpires Rupesh Khadgi and Ravindra Kolpe mentioned in the scoresheet (a copy is with TOI), ""The above-mentioned result has been declared by the organisers. We umpires are not accepting the above result as per the Mumbai Cricket Association Model Rule (PC). The final decision will be taken by theMCA committee ."" An upset Doraiswamy told this paper that Modern English will lodge a protest with the MSSA and the MCA. As per the rules, they have to register a protest in the next 48 hours.""We are protesting the final decision as according to the rule, it clearly says that the winner of the match in an 80 overs-a-side for the first innings and 40 overs-a-side for the second innings format, if the game ends in a tie, will be decided and awarded to the team with a better quotient. Even the umpires were of the same view,"" he said.However, MSSA cricket secretary Nadim Memon said, ""We went as per the rules of the first innings lead of four runs. The Harris Shield is run by the MSSA, so we took the decision as the match ended in a tie.""The MSSA and MCA officials and the umpires were present during the prize distribution ceremony.""During the prize distribution, former India skipper Dilip Vengsarkar was not pleased with the sight of as many as nine fielders on the boundary towards the closing stages of the match.The ex-national chief selector urged the organisers to change the rules in the final and make it compulsory for teams to have four fielders in the 30-yard circle. To encourage result-oriented finals, the MSSA, for the last three years, has restricted the second innings to 40 overs-a-side in the summit clash. However, that has resulted in teams tending to put defensive fields to restrict their opponents, rather than looking to dismiss them.""The Harris and Giles Shield (tournaments) hold a lot of importance in Mumbai cricket. Both the teams played well. However, in the second innings, which was 40 overs-a-side, I saw as many as nine fielders fielding on the boundary, when the equation was very close. From the next time, there must be (mandatorily) four fielders inside the 3 0-yard circle for all the 40 overs,"" Vengsarkar said.The 116-Test veteran also urged the boys to play conventional cricket in crunch situations. ""When the equation was four runs (needed) in two balls, that batsman could have played straight rather than reverse sweep. You could have won the match. Nevertheless, you guys will learn from this mistake. Don't be disappointed,"" Vengsarkar said.Anjuman 267 & 203 (Hamza Khan 57, Absurrahman Khan 37; Vivaan Jobanputra 4/80) bt Modern 263/8 & 207/6 (Kanav Saini 53, Rishabh Sadake 37, Devesh Birje 31; Yuvan Sharma 4/72) on first innings lead","Harris Shield final between Anjuman-I-Islam Allana School and Modern English, Chembur, ended in a tie.

India captain addresses form concerns after series of failures

BRISBANE: Apart from the top-order jitters, India have also been grappling with the poor form of their captain. On Wednesday, the skipper accepted for the first time that he had been struggling for runs. Rohit Sharma has scores of 3, 6 and 10 after having arrived late on this tour but more importantly, has looked uncomfortable adjusting to his new No. 6 role. Are his frustrations growing with each early dismissal?In what should come as good news for the team ahead of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne, Rohit said he was satisfied with his preparations and feeling good mentally about his batting.""I've not batted well. There's no harm in accepting that, but I know what's in my mind, how I'm preparing myself,"" he said after the announcement of Ashwin's retirement. ""All those boxes are pretty much ticked. It's just about spending as much time as possible (in the middle). As long as my mind, my body and my feet are moving well, I'm happy with how things are panning out.""Sometimes, those numbers can tell you it's been a while since he's got big runs, but for a person like me, it's all about how I feel in my mind, what kind of prep I'm having before each game. I'm feeling good about myself, to be honest. The runs are obviously not showing that but inside it's a different feeling.""It's right that Rohit hasn't spent enough time in the middle to rediscover his rhythm, but his footwork has been an issue at times, with the normally fluent new-ball hitter struggling to adjust against the older, softer Kookaburra after conceding space to KL Rahul at the top. He is scintillating when in full flow and with the long gap between the third and fourth Tests, India will be hoping to see a different Rohit at the MCG","India captain Rohit Sharma has struggled for runs in recent Tests.

Retirement of star spinner makes Gabba draw incidental as rain has the final say

BRISBANE: In the end, a strange Test match marred by rain wound its way to a bizarre draw. Only 24.1 overs of play were possible on the last day as a major thunderstorm arrived.Lightning warnings flashed on the giant screens and players were forced off the dugouts. The long rain breaks meant all eyes were instead on the social media rumour mills, which correctly predicted the impending retirement of a senior India player, just that they couldn't settle on a name.All this while, some crazy proceedings played out in the middle, a brief glimpse of what could have been if India and Australia had got a full game here. The series is still tied 1-1 going into the final two Tests of the series, but India now need to win two out of two to make it to the World Test Championship final on their own steam.Luckily, they have Jasprit Bumrah , who took a match haul of 9/94 and along with Akash Deep and Siraj, ran through a kamikaze Aussie top order which went hard at everything. Even with the possibility of a result becoming increasingly remote, Pat Cummins ' men did not give up hope.Already 185 runs ahead, their batters were given the license to go after the Indian pacers, not the easiest of tasks in these conditions, on a pitch which appeared to have quickened, displayed variable bounce and had even developed some cracks.Australia threw their bats at everything, played Mitch Marsh ahead of Travis Head and Steve Smith and declared after collapsing to 89/7. That set India a 275-run target in a hypothetical 54 overs, but only 2.1 overs of play were possible before the game had to be called off. Eventually, the no-frills retirement of Ravichandran Ashwin overshadowed everything and truly set this Indian team on the path of transition. Everyone knew a retirement was coming, but no one knew whose. Ashwin was seen with Kohli in the dressing room, the two sharing a laugh, maybe a tear, definitely a hug. Which one would it be this time? A concerned-looking Nathan Lyon had a long chat with Ravindra Jadeja on the sidelines, then with Ashwin himself. Something was definitely up.Ending all the idle chatter, Rohit and Ashwin then sat awkwardly next to each other to announce the retirement and Ashwin hesitantly declared, ""I didn't want to make this about myself. It would have been better if Bumrah was here, or Akash Deep. Rohit is unfortunate to have me alongside.""Just like the proceedings in the middle, this was a perplexing farewell for one of India's biggest-ever cricketers. There was no guard of honour, no farewell ceremony. He wasn't even in the XI. Now, he leaves for home with two Tests left. The decision may have been a matter of honour. Maybe Ashwin was tired of the constant musical chairs. We can only speculate.As for the Test, India can claim the moral victory, having saved the follow-on to upset Australia's plans, but the fact remains that they were probably saved by the rain. Probably, because we'll never know. There were other positives. Akash Deep and Jasprit Bumrah's last-wicket heroics apart, KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja's fighting half-centuries will give the team hope. ""The thing that has been in our team now is that we don't give up easily, whatever the situation. We want to keep fighting,"" Rohit said. ""Even when we bowled (in the second innings), we had the same intensity because we knew they would play their shots. There's pressure on the other team too. Until you put some pressure on the other team, you won't know how they react under pressure.""That other team, meanwhile, saw its captain Pat Cummins resisting talk of needing to be fussed about the poor returns of some of his batters, including the openers. ""We're not beholden to stats. We know there are certain roles, there are easier times to bat, harder times to bat. You're always looking at the best seven that will function as a unit,"" Cummins said.",Only 24.1 overs of play were possible on the last day as a major thunderstorm arrived. The series is still tied 1-1 going into the final two Tests of the series.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

NEW DELHI: James Foster , the former England wicketkeeper-batter, praised Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin following his retirement from international cricket shortly after the Brisbane Test ended in a draw.The announcement came during the post-match press conference, where Ashwin appeared with Indian captain Rohit Sharma . The emotional moment was evident when Virat Kohli embraced him.""He's a world-class player. It's been a real joy actually. I don't know him personally, but a real joy sort of following his career and he's an ultimate competitor. I think that's an absolute given. But I think the thing that impresses me the most it's not just his skill level, but it's the way that his game has evolved as well over this long period of time. To play the amount of cricket that he's done and play at the top level like he's done for such a long period of time, you can't just do that through luck. It's a lot of hard work, a lot of smartness, and just the way he's evolved his game. It's been great to see where he has,"" James Foster told news agency ANI.Throughout his Test career spanning 106 matches, Ashwin accumulated 537 wickets, including 37 five-wicket hauls, and scored 3,503 runs. His position as the seventh-highest wicket-taker in Test cricket history and second-highest for India, following Anil Kumble's 619 wickets, solidifies his status.Ashwin's influence was particularly significant during India's ascent to the top of Test cricket between 2014 and 2019. His limited-overs career included 181 matches with 228 wickets. He participated in 116 ODIs, securing 156 wickets and scoring 707 runs, while in 65 T20Is, he claimed 72 wickets and contributed 184 runs.His total of 765 international wickets positions him as India's second-highest wicket-taker, behind Kumble's 953. His achievements include being part of India's victorious 2011 World Cup and 2013 Champions Trophy campaigns.Ashwin concludes his career as one of cricket's most accomplished players, establishing a standard for future cricketers to aspire to.","Ravichandran Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket.
