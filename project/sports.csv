In repeated burglary cakewalks, thieves have been raiding a Nadiad confectionery, Krishna Dairy Products, and have had criminally sweet success 10 times in nine years. The shop's owner, Mukesh Pandit, 44, said the burglars seem to treat money only as a light dessert. ""Most of the time, thieves took some cash but loads of mithai - to the tune of quintals,"" he said.Pandit, who opened the shop in 2015, told TOI, ""I filed complaints three times. Police merely made 'janva jog' (station diary entries). None of the burglaries were cracked."" He installed CCTVs to signal the sour consequences of pilferage, but burglars thought the digital video recorder is the cherry on top of their booty and nicked that too. ""Before I could reinstall CCTVs, burglars struck again,"" Pandit said. ""I have done everything to stop burglaries, from putting up iron grills to placing high-tech cameras. """"A point outside my shop has a police picket. But during VVIP visits and festivals, the cops leave to join bandobusts. The burglaries occur on these days,"" he said. The latest theft was on Nov 30, during which burglars stole 12kg of kaju katri worth Rs 12,000, 73.5kg of mixed mawa sweets worth Rs 38,200, and 35kg of shrikhand worth Rs 13,300. Other purloined items were mixed biscuits worth Rs 15,000, 70kg of namkeen worth Rs 16,800, and Rs 3,500 in cash. The total loss from the break-in was Rs 98,800, Pandit said.","Krishna Dairy Products in Nadiad has been burgled 10 times in nine years.

Ruturaj Gaikwad press conference: Reveals Gautam Gambhir message, No.4 and more

Poll Do you believe Kohli can maintain this form for the upcoming matches? Yes, he can No, it's temporary I'm not sure

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli hasn’t just returned to form — he has set off a nationwide frenzy strong enough to sell out an entire stadium. Back-to-back centuries in Ranchi and Raipur have turned what was shaping up to be a low-interest ODI in Visakhapatnam into the hottest cricket ticket in India this week. According to officials at the Andhra Cricket Association (ACA), Kohli’s stunning run-scoring spree single-handedly reversed sluggish online bookings for the third ODI against South Africa at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Stadium.When tickets first went on sale digitally on November 28, the association braced for a disappointing turnout. The lack of buzz even pushed the ACA towards the rare option of setting up offline ticket counters despite committing to a fully digital system this time. But everything changed the moment Kohli unfurled a spectacular century in Ranchi on November 30. Suddenly, Phase 2 and 3 of ticket sales disappeared in minutes.“The first phase response wasn’t good,” confirmed Y. Venkatesh from ACA’s Media and Operations department to The Indian Express. “After Kohli’s hundred at Ranchi, the second and third phases vanished in minutes. Nothing was left unsold.”It wasn’t just victory that fans chased — it was the chance to witness a phenomenon.Kohli’s numbers in Vizag fuelled the madness: an average of 97.83 in seven ODIs, featuring three centuries and a 99. Even ticket prices ranging from Rs 1,200 to Rs 18,000 couldn’t slow demand.The frenzy spilled into real life, too. Hours before Team India landed in Vizag, hundreds gathered at the airport, waiting through repeated flight delays from Raipur. Security guards were bombarded with one question in multiple languages: “When are they landing?” The answer mattered because Kohli was on board.After his 53rd ODI century in Raipur, cricket legends poured in praise. But the loudest came from Mohammad Kaif, who summed up a nation’s emotion in eight simple words: “Without Kohli cricket is nothing… pure vintage!”","Back-to-back centuries in Ranchi and Raipur have turned what was shaping up to be a low-interest ODI in Visakhapatnam into the hottest cricket ticket in India this week.

Cardi B’s gift choices and jewelry twist add drama to Diggs’ big week

Nothing about Stefon Diggs’ birthday weekend was ordinary, and Cardi B made sure of it. After twerking on the New England Patriots receiver during his celebration in Miami, the rapper doubled down with another headline-grabbing moment just a day later. She posted Instagram stories flashing stacks of cash, dancing with friends, and rapping along to her song “Magnet,” turning Sunday into a continuation of the on-going celebration.With the Patriots on a bye week, the Miami nightlife became their temporary stadium, and Cardi wasn’t just a guest, she was the entertainment. From leather-clad looks to neon hair and unapologetically flashy style, the rapper’s energy matched the momentum of Diggs’ high-profile life on and off the field.Cardi’s highlights didn’t stop with Miami clubs, custom chains, and viral dance moves. Diggs received a $10,000 Chanel bag from executives Lori Hirshleifer and Marci Penn, and while the luxury gesture seemed fitting for a star wide receiver, Diggs jokingly hinted at a more practical use as a father.Posting the bag on Instagram, he wrote, “Diaper bag perhaps? Might need a couple. 😂😂 Thank you so much ❤️,” reminding fans that the flashiness now comes with family responsibilities.The pair recently welcomed their first baby together, a boy born on Nov. 4, and Cardi marked the occasion in the most Cardi B way possible, by turning part of her newborn’s umbilical cord into gold jewelry. It’s not the typical keepsake new parents choose, but it perfectly fits Cardi’s unpredictable creative flair.While some celebrities tone down after parenthood, Cardi appears determined to merge motherhood with her signature extravagance, proving that her version of “mom life” can coexist with late-night clubs, stacks of cash, and viral performances.With Diggs in his first season in New England, he’s spotlighted as much for his on-field comeback as he is for the bold new era of his personal life and Cardi B is setting the tone.Also Read: Cardi B cheers on Stefon Diggs’ unexpected lifestyle brand launch as he shines in Patriots comeback season","Cardi B celebrated Stefon Diggs' birthday weekend in Miami with lively club appearances and flashy displays of wealth.

How Parker Washington’s absence impacts Jacksonville’s offense?

Jaguars make roster adjustments ahead of Week 14

Also Read:

Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver Parker Washington will not play in today’s Week 14 matchup against the Indianapolis Colts. The announcement comes after Washington was listed as questionable earlier in the week due to a hip injury suffered during Jacksonville’s win over the Tennessee Titans. Reports from NFL Network's Ian Rapoport on December 7 confirmed that the Jaguars are choosing caution, ruling him out.Washington exited last week’s game early and followed a DNP/limited/limited practice pattern heading into Sunday. Despite progress, the team determined he was not ready to return to full-speed action.Washington has played an important role this season as Jacksonville’s No. 3 wide receiver, contributing both as a pass-catcher and a return specialist. In 12 games so far, he has recorded 36 receptions for 447 yards and three touchdowns, with 23 receptions resulting in first downs. His special teams value has also been notable, adding two punt return touchdowns this year.Without him, the Jaguars will rely on a rotation to fill his role. Tim Patrick, Dyami Brown, and recently elevated receiver Austin Trammell are expected to split snaps behind starters Brian Thomas Jr.and Jakobi Meyers. Trammell is also expected to take over punt return duties.In preparation for Washington’s absence, the Jaguars made several roster moves on December 6. Safety Eric Murray was activated from injured reserve, and wide receiver Austin Trammell and defensive back Cam’Ron Silmon-Craig were elevated from the practice squad.Trammell’s elevation comes only days after he moved back to the practice squad, highlighting the coaching staff’s confidence in him as a depth option. Offensive coordinator Liam Coen has already stated that Dyami Brown and Tim Patrick will see expanded roles with Washington out.Today’s matchup holds major playoff implications. Both the Jaguars and Colts enter Week 14 with 8-4 records, tied at the top of the AFC South standings. Jacksonville has momentum, winning three straight games and four of its last five, while Indianapolis enters the contest on a two-game losing streak.Quarterback Trevor Lawrence leads a Jaguars offense averaging 202.8 passing yards per game, while running back Travis Etienne remains the team’s top rusher with 843 yards and five touchdowns. Defensively, the Jaguars rank first in the NFL in rushing yards allowed per game (82.4).While Washington’s absence will be felt, Jacksonville will look to maintain its recent form in a matchup that could help shape the AFC postseason picture. The game is scheduled to kick off at 1 p.m. ET.","Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver Parker Washington will not play in today's Week 14 matchup against the Indianapolis Colts.

Lando Norris’ net worth



Lando Norris’ family joins in the celebrations in Abu Dhabi

McLaren star Lando Norris clinched the 2025 F1 World Championship by winning the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday. He managed to keep four-time title winner Max Verstappen behind in the Drivers’ Standings, while also dashing teammate Oscar Piastri’s title hopes. Throughout the year, he kept his focus firmly on racing, even keeping his blooming relationship with Margarida “Magui” Corceiro out of the spotlight. Now, as he celebrates his maiden title with his family, here are some off-track details about Norris, including his net worth.Norris moved from the UK to Monaco to stay close to the motorsport hub and his fellow racers. At just 26, the fastest Briton on the current grid had a slow start to the season as his teammate Oscar Piastri registered one win after another. But he eventually picked up momentum in the second half, rising to the top of the Drivers’ Standings. His determination paid off as he went on to win the F1 World Championship just a year after securing his maiden Formula 1 victory in Miami.In 2024, Norris received a contract extension with McLaren and is confirmed to stay with the team until the end of the 2027 season. With McLaren boasting the fastest car on the grid this year, there is little doubt that the new champion would look anywhere else.According to multiple reports, including The Mirror US, he earns approximately $21.35 million annually.Last year, Forbes ranked him third on the 2024 list of Highest Paid F1 Drivers, with total earnings of $35 million, while Max Verstappen topped the list with $74 million.Norris was also named in the 30 Under 30 Europe – Sports category in 2024, the year he finished runner-up in the F1 Championship as Verstappen claimed his fourth title.After the race, Lando Norris’ mother, dressed in an orange kurta and matching hairbands, rushed to him and wrapped him in a celebratory hug. The wholesome moment was shared by F1 as part of the podium celebrations in Abu Dhabi. He also shared a long hug with his Portuguese model Margarida Corceiro, who was dressed in black.A happy Norris said after the race, “It is incredible. It is pretty surreal. I dreamed of this for along, long time - I mean everyone does. A lot goes into a second like this, a lot of ups, a lot of downs. But none of that matters if you come out on top. But I did it with an incredible team. And it is not just this year, the last seven, eight years with McLaren, the last 16, 17 years of my life trying to chase my dream. My best performances this year came when I needed them the most - the second half of the season when I was on the back foot, and I managed to show the best of me. ”Norris also congratulated thanked Verstappen and Piastri for giving him a tough competition.Also Read: Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Kelly Piquet kisses Max Verstappen as he bags pole; Lando Norris says, “It is tough”","McLaren star Lando Norris clinched the 2025 F1 World Championship by winning the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday.

Abu Dhabi Grand Prix 2025 final

What were the odds of Lando Norris winning the F1 title?

It was a day for the books at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as Max Verstappen won the race but Lando Norris won the Formula 1 2025 championship amid a down-to-the-wire fight. Oscar Piastri finished second and Lando Norris finished third in the Sunday race but was enough for the latter to bring in the title. Norris has shown one of the most exemplary examples of consistent performance by winning his first F1 race in Miami last year and winning the championship a year later.Lando Norris was the overall champion even after finishing third at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. He said soon after the race, “I didn't think I would cry but I did. It is a long journey. I want to say a big thanks to my guys, everyone at McLaren, my parents. I now know what Max feels like a little bit! I want to congratulate Max and Oscar as well, it has been a pleasure to race against both of them, and to learn from both of them. But we did it, we did it!”Max Verstappen, 28, won the pole and was followed by Lando Norris, 26, in second and Oscar Piastri, 26, in third. This was one of the most enthralling F1 Championship finals in a decade, with as many as three drivers in contention for the title. While Piastri was at 392 points, Verstappen was at 396 and Norris at 408 in the Drivers’ Standings. But things went smoothly for Norris, bringing him his first F1 World Championship title.Pole-sitter Verstappen was aware of McLaren’s capabilities of overtaking him and had rightly said ahead of the final, “Slept good.Ready to go. The plan is to win the race, and rely on a bit of luck from behind.”McLaren CEO Zak Brown had made it clear they wouldn’t compromise on their chances of winning the Drivers’ Championship if it came to asking one of the drivers to sacrifice and support the other to win the title. Piastri’s fans even doubted whether the sacrifice had already been made on his part, as the driver was replaced by a rookie in FP1 and had terrible FP2 and FP3 sessions. But he made a comeback in Qualifying by finishing third. “Until Lando or Max cross the line in front of me, I’ve still got a chance of winning the title,” Piastri said ahead of the final.Lando Norris would have easily won the F1 title had he finished anywhere in the top four, with Verstappen finishing 2nd or lower at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. On the other hand, Verstappen would have won the title only if he had won the Sunday final and Norris hadn’t finished in the top three. Piastri could win the championship only if he won the Abu Dhabi race, with Norris finishing below 6th position and Verstappen ranking second or lower.The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was a star-studded affair, with several sports and Hollywood celebrities in attendance. Among them were Italian tennis star Jannik Sinner and actor Ana de Armas as well.Also Read: Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Kelly Piquet kisses Max Verstappen as he bags pole; Lando Norris says, “It is tough”",Max Verstappen won the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and Lando Norris finished third.

The discussion gained momentum after television host Sage Steele weighed in on Ayesha’s comments about her early expectations, her family life, and the pressures that followed her husband’s rise.Ayesha’s appearance on a podcast opened the door to several personal reflections, including her early dreams, the sudden shift into motherhood, and moments when fame felt overwhelming.

Steele reflected on that point in her appearance on the FULL SEND Podcast.During her conversation, Steele explained that she learned about Ayesha Curry’s remarks through her daughter. She said she approached the clip with hesitation but recognized that relationships rarely match the polished image the public sees.“You can be billionaires and I mean, she's beautiful and he's beautiful and the kids are beautiful and life's beautiful and you have rings and everybody's got something,” she said, expressing that every marriage carries its own weight.

She married Stephen in 2011 at age 22 and became pregnant within months. “Nope. You're pregnant and you're gonna be very, very sick,” she recalled.

Alix Earle stepped into Miami’s brightest spotlight this weekend, and the timing could not have been more striking. Hours after news surfaced that she and NFL wide receiver Braxton Berrios had ended their two-year relationship, the “Dancing With The Stars” finalist arrived at NYLON House looking radiant in a white mini dress. Her smile stayed steady through the night, suggesting she is choosing joy even as her personal life shifts.The split, confirmed by multiple outlets, came after months of long-distance strain. A source close to Earle told the Daily Mail: “Alix has not been happy with the direction their relationship is going in. They spend a lot of time apart and just spent Thanksgiving apart. She's happy in Los Angeles and is preparing for the DWTS Tour. Braxton is in Texas for football and he doesn't have much downtime.”Earle’s weekend in Miami aligned with Art Basel, a scene tailor-made for her social presence. She stopped by a SipMARGS event, waving to fans and posing with friends. Witnesses said she looked relaxed, enjoying the music and energy as if she were reclaiming some breathing room. Dressed in a sheer white mini dress with a garter belt and stockings, she carried herself with confidence and ease.The outing marked her first major appearance since Berrios missed the “DWTS” finale. She had already clarified that his absence was because of football, not relationship trouble, yet the chatter intensified until Page Six confirmed their split. The two had once navigated bi-coastal schedules, with Earle often in Los Angeles or Miami while Berrios trained in Texas under a one-year, $2 million Texans contract. They managed brief reunions, including a lavish birthday celebration in October when Berrios said: “I hope everybody gets to feel as loved as I felt this weekend. There’s nothing better than being surrounded by the people you love that traveled across the country to be there for you. Alix I don't know how you pulled this surprise off but I'm so thankful you did. What a way to start 30!”Despite that affection, long distance eventually caught up with them. While Earle danced her way through Miami’s busiest art week, Berrios prepared for a crucial Texans game against the Kansas City Chiefs.Surrounded by celebrities and friends, Earle looked every bit like someone settling into the next chapter on her own terms.Also Read: Tom Brady can’t contain himself after Caleb Williams unleashes jaw-dropping laser touchdown against Packers","Alix Earle and NFL wide receiver Braxton Berrios have ended their two-year relationship.

Caleb Williams ’ surgical touchdown pass sparks the Bears



The Chicago Bears walked into the afternoon matchup against the Green Bay Packers with hopes of finding rhythm, but the first half offered very little to build on. The offense struggled to move the ball, finishing the opening two quarters with fewer than 100 yards. Every snap looked forced. Every drive looked slower than the last. The Packers controlled the line of scrimmage, and the Bears looked like they were searching for any spark that could lift them back into the game. Nothing seemed to work, and the three points on the scoreboard felt like a generous outcome.Things shifted the moment the second half began. Chicago’s defense opened with a strong stand and forced a quick punt, handing the ball back to the offense with a chance to answer. What followed was the type of response the Bears had been waiting for all day. It unfolded on live television as Tom Brady lit up in real time over the play that changed the tone of the afternoon. His reaction was full of excitement, highlighted by his call: ""I like the idea of getting caleb outside of the pocket. . drops it down, barely through the arms of Nixon in coverage... and finds Zaccheaus. What a catch! What a great camera angle, side-arm delivery, through Nixon's arms and then finds Zaccheaus ... from the pylon cam, what a drive, KB!""Caleb Williams took control of the moment with a crisp and confident 10-play drive that reminded everyone why he is so highly regarded.He executed the play-action fake, rolled right, and delivered a perfect ball to Olamide Zaccheaus. The pass arrived inches before Zaccheaus reached the boundary, placed exactly where only he could secure it. The alternate end-zone angle Brady mentioned made the throw look even more impressive. It captured the precision, the timing and the trust between quarterback and receiver.For a team that had stumbled through two frustrating quarters, this touchdown felt like oxygen. Williams had been off the mark earlier, and the defense had already surrendered two explosive scores. Yet this single throw cut through all of it. No defender had a chance at it, and Zaccheaus’ grip sealed the play.If the Bears hope to build momentum in the weeks ahead, more moments like this from Williams will be essential.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders’ mom Pilar steals the show with explosive tirade at Browns coaches in middle of Titans matchup","Caleb Williams’ surgical touchdown pass sparks the Bears back into the game.

Their loss to the two-win Titans sealed their elimination from the AFC race, a moment many fans expected weeks ago. What stings more is how close the team was to keeping the season alive. Right after their win over the Las Vegas Raiders, there was a tiny window where Cleveland held an 8 percent playoff chance if they managed to run the table and finish 9-8. That window shut fast.Cleveland now sits at 3-10, and even with flashes of strong play from rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders, the reality settled in quickly. The shock is not that they are out. What surprises many is that the Browns could still finish tied for first in the AFC North at 7-10 when Week 18 ends. That twist adds another strange layer to a season full of conflicting storylines, including a sideline moment that turned into a viral storm.Shedeur Sanders was on the sideline when another Sanders stole the spotlight. His mom, Pilar, made sure her voice rang louder than the cheers in Cleveland’s section.While Coach Prime hugged his son before kickoff, Pilar focused on something entirely different. She hated how head coach Kevin Stefanski and the offensive staff kept taking the ball out of Shedeur’s hands.During the game, Pilar filmed herself in Instagram Reels, wrapped in a furry winter coat yet looking composed and confident. Her message, though, was fiery. She stared into the camera and said, ""You know, this fking wildcat, is bullst."" An hour later, after Shedeur threw a touchdown, she returned with proof for everyone watching. ""Whew. See what happens when you don't do the wildcat."" She captioned the clip, ""LET SHEDEUR COOK!!!!!""For fans unfamiliar with football tactics, the wildcat removes the quarterback from the play and places the snap in the hands of a running back. Pilar has long pushed back against anyone who limits her son, even calling out Rex Ryan earlier this season. She shows up at almost all of Shedeur’s games, even when he sat third on the depth chart. Deion has said he would only attend when Shedeur is QB1.Through highs and lows, one thing remains constant. Shedeur’s mom will always have his back.Also Read: Deion Sanders’ surprise Browns visit creates touching father-son moment amid Shedeur Sanders’ major NFL strides","Shedeur Sanders' mom, Pilar, took to Instagram to voice her displeasure with the Browns.

Wilt Chamberlain drops a blunt verdict on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar that shatters image of Showtime Los Angeles Lakers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/wilt-chamberlain-drops-a-blunt-verdict-on-kareem-abdul-jabbar-that-shatters-image-of-showtime-los-angeles-lakers/articleshow/125824542.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Wilt Chamberlain calls Kareem Abdul-Jabbar the weak link on the Showtime Los Angeles Lakers

The NBA in the 1980s was defined by intensity, pride, and rivalries that felt larger than life, with the Los Angeles Lakers at the center of it all. Showtime transformed into a full-blown Hollywood spectacle, a flurry of fast-paced plays and bright lights spearheaded by Magic Johnson. Yet, underneath all that glamour was a rising tension that only a legend like Wilt Chamberlain had the courage to speak out about.Back in 1986, during a heated debate, Chamberlain locked eyes with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , his former rival and the steady backbone of the Lakers dynasty, and unleashed a critique that left everyone stunned. He pointed out Abdul-Jabbar’s transition game, saying that the veteran star was throwing off the rhythm that had made the Lakers a powerhouse. It was a tense moment, charged with years of rivalry, personal pride, and the legacy of two Hall of Fame careers. The Lakers were on a roll at 35-9, dominating the league, but Wilt sensed there was more going on beneath the surface of the Showtime sparkle. With the Celtics coming up, the pace quickening, and the pressure rising, his words landed like a challenge.Wilt Chamberlain, the towering 7-foot-1 scoring powerhouse who ruled the 1960s with his 100-point games and four MVP awards, had a legendary rivalry with Abdul-Jabbar.They went head-to-head 94 times, with Chamberlain leading 52-42. By the 1980s, although Chamberlain was retired, he stayed an active commentator, frequently showing up on TV to analyze the game.During a TV debate in January 1986 about the Lakers' dynasty, which included both Chamberlain and Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain didn't hold back on his criticism. Addressing the panel and the audience, he stated, ""I like to be blunt. I think that the weak link surprisingly enough on this fantastic Laker team is Kareem. Why? Well, because his transition game is the worst I've ever seen, but remarkably so at the end of the game, he is the best out there. ""The remark came during the Lakers' pursuit of the championship; they had a record of 35-9 at that moment. Chamberlain recognized Abdul-Jabbar's ability to perform under pressure but pointed out that the center's slow approach didn't mesh well with the fast-paced Showtime style.Abdul-Jabbar was there for the conversation but chose not to reply on air. Their shared background added tension: both were raised in Philadelphia and had been part of the same draft class in 1960, but a sense of rivalry remained.This wasn't just small talk. In his 1991 autobiography A View from Above, Chamberlain reflected on the same ideas regarding the evolution of great players, commending Abdul-Jabbar's fundamentals while also pointing out the shift towards athleticism in that era.Also Read: Why the NBA fined Philadelphia 76ers 100K for an incorrect injury report?","Wilt Chamberlain called Kareem Abdul-Jabbar the weak link on the Showtime Los Angeles Lakers.

Could This Deal Actually Happen?

A proposed blockbuster trade between thehas set off conversations across the league, mainly because it involves two players headed in opposite directions on the rumor mill. Cincinnati has repeatedly insisted they do not want to trade, while Boston appears very open to moving outfielder Jarren Duran. Still, a new projection imagines a scenario where both teams meet in the middle.According to The Athletic’s Jim Bowden, the deal would look like this:Bowden explained the logic behind the projection by saying, “Boston continues to add to their starting rotation cabinet, giving them an intimidating top three with Garrett Crochet, Sonny Gray and Greene. The Reds get a dynamic table-setter for the top of their lineup, one pitcher who can step into the rotation immediately and another for the development group to work with.” (H/t: Sporting News)Cincinnati Reds have built their identity around young power arms, with Greene viewed as a centerpiece of that foundation. The front office has made it clear they are reluctant to part with him. However, the Reds’ lack of consistent production at the plate has become hard to ignore. Their pitching is the team’s strength, and a move centered around improving the lineup could force internal re-evaluation.• Hunter Greene is considered the potential ace Cincinnati wants to build around• The Cincinnati Reds’ offensive issues may push them toward unconventional solutions• Boston Red Sox’s overcrowded outfield makes Duran a realistic trade chip• Tolle and Paez offer pitching depth that softens the blow of losing GreeneThe Reds need more hitting at the top of their lineup, and Jarren Duran brings exactly that: speed, on-base ability, and a dynamic presence.Beyond Duran, Payton Tolle already debuted in 2025 and has shown early flashes of being a rotation-ready contributor. While he isn’t projected to reach Greene’s ace-level ceiling, he may develop into a dependable starter.Jedixson Paez gives Cincinnati a developmental arm to continue shaping, something the organization has excelled at in recent years.• A true table-setter in Duran• A promising young pitcher with MLB experience in Tolle• A long-term developmental project in PaezBoston Red Sox have been looking for ways to strengthen its rotation, and adding Greene would immediately give them one of the more intimidating trios in the American League alongside Garrett Crochet and Sonny Gray. The Red Sox also benefit from clearing their outfield logjam by moving a player they’ve been open to dealing.• A massively talented power pitcher with ace upside• Immediate rotational credibility without weakening their lineup coreWhile the projection is compelling, its shock value is undeniable. Cincinnati’s hesitation to move Greene is well documented, but the right offer could push them to reconsider, especially if it means addressing their offensive needs without depleting their pitching depth entirely. For Boston, the move solves two problems at once: roster imbalance and rotational inconsistency.If this trade were ever executed, it would be one of the more surprising deals of the offseason, but also one that could genuinely work for both sides. Cincinnati shores up its lineup and maintains pitching stability, while Boston acquires a frontline arm and eases its outfield congestion.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Chicago Cubs could sign $66 million Cincinnati Reds star in Free Agency ahead of deadline It’s the kind of proposal that stirs debate, not because it’s impossible, but because it forces both clubs to weigh long-term identity against immediate opportunity, exactly why the projection from original writer Billy Heyen and the quote from Jim Bowden is drawing so much attention.","A new projection imagines a scenario where both teams meet in the middle.

Gisele Bündchen finds more freedom with Joaquim Valente after years in Tom Brady’s shadow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/gisele-bndchen-finds-more-freedom-with-joaquim-valente-after-years-in-tom-bradys-shadow/articleshow/125816698.cms,"Gisele Bündchen is reportedly feeling more like herself after her divorce from Tom Brady, embracing a quieter life focused on family and personal growth. Her new relationship with jiu-jitsu trainer Joaquim Valente offers her independence and emotional fulfillment, allowing her to step out of the spotlight she once shared with a global sports icon.

Why reports claim Gisele “feels freer” with Joaquim and how Tom Brady reacted to her new life

Gisele Bündchen has spent nearly two decades in the public eye as one of the most recognized supermodels in the world, but she has also lived many of those years under intense scrutiny as the wife of NFL icon Tom Brady. After their 2022 divorce, she chose a quieter chapter, focusing on family, healing and personal growth.Now, with her relationship with jiu-jitsu trainer Joaquim Valente flourishing and the arrival of their first child together, a new report claims Gisele feels more like herself than she has in years. According to insiders, her new romance isn’t just about love; it’s about finally stepping out of the spotlight she once shared with one of sports’ biggest names.According to Page Six, the Brazilian model “felt like she lived in his shadow for a long time” during her marriage to Brady. While she has often praised their time together and is “grateful for what she had” with the retired quarterback, sources claim her life now is more independent and emotionally fulfilling. Her relationship with Joaquim reportedly allows her to slow down, live more privately, and focus more deeply on family without the pressures of being attached to a global sports brand.Gisele and Joaquim quietly began dating in 2023, choosing intimacy over publicity.The pair welcomed a son in February 2025, marking Gisele’s third child and Valente’s first. Insiders say she is “absolutely loving this new chapter” and is excited about the future.Even though she has moved on, her relationship with Brady remains respectful, with both co-parenting their children, Benjamin and Vivian. Reports also suggest Brady was initially shocked to learn Gisele was expecting a child with Joaquim. As one source noted, “It just wasn’t something that was on his radar.”Despite the surprise, more recent speculation hints that Brady has offered congratulations and may even be rekindling a past romance with Irina Shayk. While those rumors remain unconfirmed, the overall tone suggests both families are learning how to navigate life after marriage.For Gisele, that journey seems rooted in a newfound ease, one defined not by fame or football, but by balance, privacy and love on her own terms.Also Read: “Not what I dreamed of”: Gisele Bündchen reflects on her marriage to Tom Brady with honesty and acceptance years after their split","Gisele Bündchen is reportedly feeling more like herself after her divorce from Tom Brady.

Pete Alonso and Kyle Schwarber seen as Boston’s strongest chance to upgrade the offense

Pete Alonso and Kyle Schwarber are now the two main power hitters the Boston Red Sox are looking at for this offseason. This comes after the Red Sox were knocked out by the New York Yankees in the postseason last month in New York. The team wants strong bats, and these two names are seen as the best way to fix the middle of the order, according to The Athletic reporter Jen McCaffrey, who wrote this in a detailed report published in late November 2025.Boston already added Sonny Gray and Johan Oviedo to help the pitching staff, but the club still needs a hitter who can bring steady power every day. The Red Sox lost Rafael Devers before last season in a trade, and Alex Bregman chose free agency this month. Because of that, the front office believes a strong hitter in the heart of the lineup is now the top need.Jen McCaffrey wrote that Pete Alonso and Kyle Schwarber “represent the best opportunity to upgrade the offense,” and the Red Sox front office agrees with that view.Alonso, who played first base for the New York Mets last season, is known for long home runs and steady run production.He becomes one of the top power bats on the market this winter.Published during the last week of November 2025, just before the start of the winter meetings, the report was made public.Having played for the Philadelphia Phillies in 2025, Kyle Schwarber hit 56 home runs last year. He is free to sign a long-term contract having earlier this month rejected the Phillies' qualifying offer in Philadelphia.Many MLB insiders predict he will sign a roughly five-year, $145 million deal.Having played in Boston in years past as well, Schwarber knows Fenway Park and how hitters adapt to the wall in left field.At the GM meetings this month, Red Sox chief baseball officer Craig Breslow told journalists and verified that the team is striving for a potent middle-order bat.Breslow said, “Someone who is a threat who can hit in the middle of the order and can lengthen our lineup is something we want to pursue.”His comments came during his on-record session with reporters, held at the annual meetings in Arizona earlier this month.These moves matter because Boston needs instant power. Both Alonso and Schwarber can change a game with one swing.If the Red Sox land even one of them, the lineup becomes much harder to pitch to, especially in tight games or late innings.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: Toronto Blue Jays Eying Kyle Tucker This Week As Pete Alonso Becomes A Key Red Sox Move","Pete Alonso and Kyle Schwarber seen as Boston’s strongest chance to upgrade the offense.

Khamzat Chimaev, Pavel Durov and what comes next for ‘Borz’

Khamzat Chimaev posted on X this week asking Telegram founder Pavel Durov to be in his corner for his next fight. The message came while Chimaev is off the fight list for a foot surgery and a planned recovery that will stretch into and after Ramadan 2026.Khamzat Chimaev said he wants a big name with him when he steps back into the Octagon. The post read in part, “Brother @durov in my corner next …” and the invite quickly made headlines across MMA sites and social feeds. Promoters and media now watch to see if Durov, the billionaire Telegram CEO will accept.Khamzat Chimaev is injured and will have a small operation on his foot, sources say. He told reporters he will pause full training until after Ramadan.That timing means he likely will not fight until late March or April 2026, depending on recovery. While he heals, Chimaev has named Nassourdine Imavov as a possible next challenger and has also answered calls for a superfight with Alex Pereira.Chimaev’s public invite to Pavel Durov adds a new twist. Durov is a tech billionaire (listed at about $17.1 billion by some outlets) and he has recently worked with former fighters like Khabib Nurmagomedov on Telegram projects.Khabib sold digital papakha collectibles on Telegram and helped raise roughly $4–4.5 million in November 2025, showing how the platform can link fighters and rich backers. That history makes Durov a logical target for Chimaev’s request.There is also history between Chimaev and Team Khabib. The two sides had a near-brawl after UFC 280 in Abu Dhabi in October 2022 when Chimaev pushed Abubakar Nurmagomedov.Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and Khabib later helped calm things down. Recently, Chimaev posted a message praising Islam Makhachev and showing he wants peace with the Dagestani group.That all makes a Durov cornering moment possible, since Khabib and Durov have worked together before.Chimaev’s X post and the reports appeared in late November to early December 2025.His surgery and plan to resume full training after Ramadan were reported during the same period by MMA outlets covering UFC offseason news.If recovery goes well, Khamzat Chimaev’s comeback fight could happen in spring or early summer 2026.Also Read: Joe Rogan Claims Jesus May Come Back As Artificial Intelligence And Sends Social Media Into Debate","Khamzat Chimaev is injured and will have a small operation on his foot.

CHENNAI: The contrast between India and defending champions Germany was visible long before the first whistle. The Germans went about their warm-up with almost schoolboy-like discipline — lines straight, movements synchronized, every player in tune.This, despite them studying, training and working across Germany and coming together only a few weeks before the tournament. The Indians, who have been together for almost two years at the SAI, South Centre in Bengaluru, meanwhile, scattered across their half of the turf, mirroring the lack of structure that would later define their evening. What followed was a 1-5 defeat that brutally exposed the gulf between the two sides in the semifinals of the FIH Hockey Men’s Junior World Cup here on Sunday.For the first time in the tournament, every seat at the Mayor Radhakrishnan Stadium was taken. But it took Germany all of 14 minutes to drain the energy out of the stands, and the fans barely found their voice again, aware that hope was evaporating fast. The unraveling began with Ankit Pal, who conceded back-to-back infringements inside the circle — the second earning Germany a penalty stroke. Lukas Kossel made no mistake, sneaking the ball between goalkeeper Princedeep Singh’s left pad and glove.Barely a minute later, and against the run of play, Justus Warweg swept in Germany’s second from the top of the circle, with a defender shielding Prince Deep’s view but not the trajectory of the ball. On the stroke of halftime, Germany tightened their grip as Kossel struck again, this time off a penalty corner.While India squandered three penalty corners in the third quarter and continued to restrict themselves to the flanks, Germany exploited the open lanes. With defenders outnumbered, Princedeep had to rush out, only for Jonas von Gersum to slot in the 40th minute.","Defending champions Germany beat India 1-5 in the semifinals of the FIH Hockey Men’s Junior World Cup here on Sunday.

Taylor Swift proved yet again that she is Travis Kelce’s biggest supporter as she returned to the stands for another Kansas City Chiefs game, this time during their matchup against the Houston Texans, setting off a wave of excitement across social media.

Gautam Gambhir Press Conference: Team India head coach heaves fire after 2-1 ODI series win over SA

NEW DELHI: India head coach Gautam Gambhir is under increasing scrutiny after consecutive home Test series defeats, despite enjoying early success with India’s Champions Trophy and Asia Cup wins since taking charge in July last year. The team’s struggles in red-ball cricket — including a 3-0 loss to New Zealand followed by a 2-0 defeat against South Africa — have raised alarms, especially as India have been whitewashed in a home Test series only three times in history, with two of those coming during Gambhir’s stint.However, former India head coach Ravi Shastri believes criticism should not be directed at just one individual. Speaking on Prabhat Khabar’s YouTube podcast, he urged a broader view of accountability.""So when results come, one thing the public should remember is that players should also take responsibility. It should not be that you target one individual. It has happened to me, that is why I am speaking from experience. So it is important that the players also take the rap on the knuckles when something like this happens. There should be pride. They should feel hurt that we have lost. Until that happens, things will not move forward,"" he said.""Har match jitna hai. Nahi jitega to bandook tumhari taraf. Agar ye mere saath hota to mai pehle responsibility leta. Wo pride hona chaiye. Hurt hona chaiye ki hum haare hain. Pressure sabko aata hai. Jhelna padta hai. Cricket is 90 percent here in the mind [We have to win every match. If we don’t win, the gun will point at you. If this had happened with me, I would have taken responsibility first. There should be pride. You should feel hurt that we have lost. Everyone feels pressure. You have to deal with it. Cricket is 90 percent here — in the mind],"" Shastri said.Shastri also highlighted the importance of leadership qualities beyond tactics.""If your performance is poor, you could be fired. Therefore, you need to maintain patience. Communication and man-management skills are crucial here. Only then can you motivate the players to win. And that's what we did. The most important thing is to enjoy whatever you do. Don't take it as pressure,"" he explained.Drawing from his time overseeing India’s dominant Test period between 2014 and 2021, Shastri stressed that defeats should be viewed collectively.Watch the video here ""Everyone, right from the team management to the players, you can't single out one person. It's a collective decision. South Africa defeated India; no single player defeated India. South Africa played well as a team. Where did we play?"" he questioned.While he avoided directly criticising Gambhir, Shastri reiterated shared accountability for the recent slump.India’s first-ever home Test whitewash took place in 1999–2000, also against South Africa — a reminder of how rare such setbacks have been.",India head coach Gautam Gambhir is under increasing scrutiny after consecutive home Test series defeats.

Poll How important is it for young players like Jaiswal to receive support from experienced players? Very Important Somewhat Important Not Important

VISAKHAPATNAM: Though he was ignored for the Asia Cup, Yashasvi Jaiswal was not disheartened. Instead he focused on working hard.“It’s all in the selectors’ hands. They look at it from a team combination point of view. I’ll keep doing my thing and I know my time will come. Till then, I’ll keep working on myself, developing myself,” he had said.When his time had come he grabbed it with both hands. Playing only his fourth ODI, he notched up an impressive maiden century -- an unbeaten 116 (121b; 12x4, 2x6) -- as India chased down the 271-run target with ease to clinch the ODI series in Visakhapatnam on Saturday.However, when a fit-again Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer return, they are sure starters and the coach Gautam Gambhir is keen to keep the youngsters motivated. “We’ve seen how much quality he (Jaiswal) has, especially what he does in Test cricket. And obviously it’s just the start of his career, especially in white ball cricket. Hopefully he has a massive future ahead. Ruturaj also is a class player and he proved his credentials with India A,” said the coach afterwards.“We try to give them opportunities wherever we can, because we still want a reasonable group of players, probably around 20-25 players in that group before the (ODI) World Cup. Whenever you get an opportunity, both the guys grab that with both their hands. But once your captain and vice-captain is back, obviously they are your starters. And more importantly, I think they need to keep themselves motivated, because they should be ready whenever they get that opportunity, to try and grab that,” he added on Saturday.He was also impressed with the way Jaiswal paced his innings and said he will have more success once he realises the template he needs to play. “You’ve got 300 balls in ODIs. Sometimes you’ve got to respect the new ball as well, similar to what Yashasvi did today. He was able to see off the new ball against Marco Jansen. And we know that once you’re able to see off the new ball, things can get much easier,” he said.On his part, Jaiswal said batting with Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli helped him. “Rohit and I have chatted a lot on how we play and what tempo to go with. I’ve been unable to convert the starts. I was only thinking of how to balance the innings. Sometimes I need to be more attacking and sometimes get singles and consolidate. I have to control my thoughts. I need to go after bowlers, knowing when I need to do that helps. Once Virat-paaji came in, he played a lot of shots. He helped me set targets as well,” Jaiswal said.",Yashasvi Jaiswal scores maiden ODI century in India's 2-1 ODI series win over South Africa. India coach Gautam Gambhir keen to keep youngsters motivated. Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer will be sure starters when they return.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125825751,imgsize-37802,width-400,resizemode-4/yashasvi-jaiswal.jpg"
