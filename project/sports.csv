Connor McDavid stays composed amid speculation

As the Edmonton Oilers prepare for the 2025-26 NHL season, all eyes are on their captain, Connor McDavid, who is entering the final year of his eight-year, $100 million contract. Despite his incredible impact on the franchise, McDavid’s future in Edmonton remains uncertain and according to NHL insider Darren Dreger, that uncertainty is starting to make the organization nervous.During a recent segment, Dreger revealed that Oilers owner Daryl Katz is becoming “a little antsy” as Connor McDavid continues to deliberate on his next move. While Darren Dreger clarified that there’s “no animosity” between McDavid and the front office, he admitted there’s growing unease within the organization about the lack of progress..“There's no animosity here,” Dreger explained. “Is there nervousness building? Sure, you know, I mean, Daryl Katz is probably getting a little antsy, the owner of the Edmonton Oilers. And then that message would be delivered to Jeff Jackson and on to Stan Bowman, the general manager.”Dreger noted that Edmonton is “ready to close whenever Connor is ready,” but the timeline remains entirely in Connor McDavid’s hands. He estimated the chances of an extension happening soon at “50-50” and suggested that any potential deal could be short-term, possibly just two years, a prospect that could unsettle both management and fans.While some worry about the distractions, NHL analyst Eddie Olczyk believes McDavid won’t let the situation affect his performance. “Well, I don't think it's going to hang over Connor McDavid because, just, he breathes different air,” Olczyk said. “I don't think it's going to affect him one bit.”Also Read: Edmonton Oilers reportedly exploring shocking reunion with 40-year-old Marc-Andre Fleury Since his debut in 2015, McDavid has consistently proven to be a generational player, leading Edmonton to consecutive Stanley Cup Final appearances and surpassing the 100-point mark eight times.

Turning Point USA promises a “patriotic alternative” to Bad Bunny’s halftime show

Bad Bunny fires back at critics and doubles down on representation

The NFL ’s decision to name Bad Bunny as the headliner for the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show has sparked one of the most polarizing cultural debates in recent memory. While millions of fans worldwide celebrated the Puerto Rican megastar’s appointment, conservative circles — led by Turning Point USA, the late Charlie Kirk’s right-wing political organization — are striking back with their own plan: a rival event called The All American Halftime Show.On Thursday, Turning Point USA’s official X (formerly Twitter) account confirmed the initiative, writing, “It’s true, Turning Point USA is thrilled to announce The All American Halftime Show. Performers and event details coming soon.”The announcement follows a week of escalating backlash from conservative commentators who claim Bad Bunny’s selection represents a cultural shift that sidelines traditional American performers. Critics have also resurfaced the artist’s past remarks about U.S. immigration enforcement and his outspoken criticism of former president Donald Trump .For Turning Point, the timing is deliberate. The group, known for its fusion of pop culture and politics, is positioning the rival concert as a “celebration of American values,” a move that could appeal to disenchanted NFL fans who see the league’s halftime programming as increasingly political.Meanwhile, Bad Bunny has shown no signs of backing down. Hosting Saturday Night Live, the global superstar addressed the controversy with confidence and pride.“I’m very excited to be doing the Super Bowl, and I know people all around the world who love my music are also happy,” he said.Switching to Spanish, he added, “Especially all of the Latinos and Latinas in the world here in the United States who have worked to open doors. It’s more than a win for myself, it’s a win for all of us. Our footprints and our contribution in this country, no one will ever be able to take that away or erase it.”And in a final jab aimed at his detractors, he quipped, “If you didn’t understand what I just said, you have four months to learn.”Also Read: Is Jalen Carter playing against the Giants?

Bad Bunny’s global influence outweighs critics’ complaints

When the NFL confirmed that Bad Bunny would headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show, the news sent waves through both the music and sports worlds. The Puerto Rican megastar’s selection marked a historic shift, he would be the first artist to perform the show primarily in Spanish, signaling a bold embrace of Latin culture on America’s biggest stage. But as the applause rolled in, so did the criticism.Model and media personality Kayla Nicole, who once dated Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce , addressed the uproar on her podcast Pre-Game, sharing a sharp take on what the public reaction revealed. “I think that the discourse, too, around this whole Benito halftime show, I’m just thankful for moments like this,” she said.She added, “Because every time it happens, anything that has like any level of cultural significance, I know exactly who I need to unfollow and delete out of my f*****g life, because the racist people will tell on themselves every single time.”Her remarks struck a chord online, as social media debates over Bad Bunny’s performance quickly turned into conversations about language, culture, and inclusivity. Some fans questioned whether a Spanish-language show belonged in the Super Bowl, claiming they wouldn’t understand the lyrics.Nicole brushed off those complaints, pointing out the hypocrisy behind them. “The amount of people complaining because they’re not going to be able to understand the words because they don’t know Spanish,” she said.“I’ve listened to so much, so many genres where I don’t know what they’re talking about, but I still love a beat.”At just 31, Bad Bunny has become a cultural force unlike any other. With three Grammy wins, 10 nominations, and billions of streams, he’s helped redefine what global stardom looks like. His selection for the Super Bowl isn’t just about entertainment, it’s a statement about where American pop culture is headed.Also Read: Speaker Mike Johnson accuses NFL of turning ‘anti-American’ after picking Bad Bunny for Super Bowl halftime show While critics question whether a Spanish-led performance fits the Super Bowl’s mainstream tradition, Nicole and many fans see it differently.

And as Nicole made clear, the outrage says far more about those clinging to old biases than about Bad Bunny himself.","Model and media personality Kayla Nicole addressed the uproar over Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show on her podcast Pre-Game.

Is Jalen Carter playing tonight?



How Jalen Carter’s injury impacts the Eagles’ defense



The Philadelphia Eagles will be missing one of their biggest defensive weapons in Thursday night’s NFC East showdown against the New York Giants. Star defensive tackle Jalen Carter has been ruled inactive due to a heel injury, marking another setback for the reigning Super Bowl champions as they continue to battle early-season adversity.No, Jalen Carter will not suit up against the Giants. The Second-Team All-Pro appeared on the Eagles’ injury report Wednesday after limited practice participation with a heel issue. Despite traveling with the team and joining pregame warmups briefly, Carter was declared inactive just hours before kickoff.NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo confirmed the update, noting that Carter “was on the field only briefly, signing autographs and speaking with agent Drew Rosenhaus before leaving the field.” The absence is significant, as this marks the second game this season that Carter will miss.Philadelphia’s defensive line will have to adjust quickly. The Eagles elevated defensive tackle Gabe Hall from the practice squad earlier Thursday, joining Jordan Davis, Moro Ojomo, Byron Young, and Ty Robinson to anchor the middle of the defense. The reshuffled group faces added pressure to fill the massive void left by Carter, who has been a disruptive force when healthy.Carter’s absence couldn’t have come at a worse time. The Eagles’ defense, built around its fierce pass rush, relies heavily on Carter’s ability to collapse pockets and disrupt plays from the interior. Without him, defensive coordinator Vic Fangio may need to tweak his approach, leaning more on Jordan Davis and Byron Young to contain the Giants’ offensive line.Philadelphia’s injury list doesn’t end there. Pro Bowl left guard Landon Dickerson (ankle) and tight end Grant Calcaterra (oblique) have both been ruled out for Week 6, further testing the team’s depth. However, there’s some relief with linebacker Nakobe Dean’s return from a knee injury, offering a spark to the defense in Carter’s absence.Carter’s heel injury adds to a turbulent season already marked by highs and lows, including his early-season ejection for spitting on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott. The Eagles now face the challenge of keeping momentum alive without their defensive anchor as they aim for another deep playoff run.Also Read: Saquon Barkley’s fiancée Anna gets emotional watching his heartwarming pregame moment with daughter before facing former team",Jalen Carter has been ruled out of Thursday night's game against the New York Giants.

How Brittany Mahomes became a lightning rod for criticism

How she learned to rise above the noise

Brittany Mahomes has long been one of the most polarizing figures in NFL circles, not for anything she’s done on the field, but for how openly she lives her life off it. As the wife of Kansas City Chiefs superstar Patrick Mahomes , Brittany has spent years navigating fame, online criticism, and the often unforgiving microscope that comes with being part of the NFL’s most-watched power couple.From her outspoken opinions to her viral game-day moments, Brittany has never shied away from expressing herself \ and fans have never hesitated to respond. One of her most talked-about incidents came in January 2022, when she popped a bottle of champagne after a Chiefs playoff win and sprayed it into the crowd, earning mixed reactions from viewers. Some called it tone-deaf, while others defended it as pure joy in the moment.She’s also drawn heat for her candid social media activity. Back in August 2024, she was criticized for liking Instagram comments expressing political support for Donald Trump , including one that read “TRUMP-VANCE 2024.” The backlash was swift, but Brittany didn’t stay silent. Responding to critics, she wrote, “I mean honestly, to be a hater as an adult, you have to have some deep-rooted issues you refuse to heal from childhood.”It wasn’t the first time she’s clashed with fans. Dating back to 2018, Brittany has been known to call out referees during Chiefs games, famously tweeting that “refs are never in our favor” after a controversial loss to the Buffalo Bills.In recent interviews, Brittany has taken a reflective tone, admitting that the online attention once got to her but that she’s learned to handle it with the help of her husband. Speaking on the WHOOP podcast, she said, “Having him to help me get through it has helped a lot, because he is very good at managing those things and blocking people out.”Patrick’s advice, she revealed, was simple but powerful: “Block out the haters.” Over time, that mindset reshaped her confidence. “I think social media used to get me a lot, and now it's just like honestly I don't give a f--- about what people have to say about me anymore,” she shared.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes turns heads in Abercrombie & Fitch NFL collection as Randi Mahomes proudly cheers her on Now, Brittany Mahomes stands as someone who’s learned to turn criticism into confidence, embracing her public role on her own terms and proving that resilience, not approval, defines her story.","Brittany Mahomes is the wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.

Russell Wilson opens up to Ciara in personal message



Russell Wilson’s challenging season with the Giants



The New York Giants started Thursday Night Football by playing Jaxson Dart over veteran quarterback Russell Wilson for the Week 6 clash against the Philadelphia Eagles. This marks Wilson’s third consecutive game on the bench after a series of underwhelming performances earlier in the season. While the benching has sparked debate, it is purely a football decision and not injury-related, signaling a shift in the Giants’ strategy.While football is a huge part of Russell Wilson’s life, his family provides him with balance during challenging times. On October 1, he shared a heartfelt Instagram post featuring his wife, Ciara, and their four children. “Thank You God for blessing me with my family,” Wilson wrote. “Moments we cherish for LIFE!!! ❤️🙏🏾 @ciara.”Wilson and Ciara have been active in philanthropy, donating millions of meals during the pandemic, supporting Colorado communities, and even authoring a children’s book to inspire kids to chase their dreams. Their family focus appears to give Wilson strength amid professional setbacks, demonstrating that his legacy extends beyond the field.As the Giants face the defending Super Bowl champions, the Philadelphia Eagles, Wilson remains poised to contribute if called upon.While Dart leads the offense, Wilson’s presence is a reminder that experience and resilience are never far from the game.Super Bowl champion Russell Wilson, 36, entered the 2025 season with high expectations after signing a $10.5 million contract with the Giants. He was named the starter over Jameis Winston and rookie Jaxson Dart, but early struggles have left fans and management questioning his form. A Week 3 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, where Wilson threw two interceptions and was booed by the home crowd, accelerated the decision to hand the reins to Dart. Fans even chanted, “we want Dart,” highlighting the growing demand for a change at quarterback.The move paid off initially, as Dart led the Giants to their first win of the season against the Chargers in Week 4. Although the team fell to the Saints 26-14 in Week 5, the Giants opted to stick with Dart, showing confidence in the rookie’s potential against a tough Philadelphia squad.

Who Is Jaxson Dart’s Mom Kara Dart?



Kara Dart’s Role Beyond the Field



Jaxson Dart made an unforgettable debut for the New York Giants, leading the team to snap their 0-3 losing streak and ending the Los Angeles Chargers’ undefeated run. But as cameras captured the rookie quarterback’s triumph, one face stood out—his mother, Kara Dart. Her emotional reactions went viral, and the tender post-game hug between mother and son left fans wanting to know more about the woman behind the rising NFL star.Kara Dart was born and raised in Utah and has always been a standout athlete. A two-time all-state basketball player at Weber High School in Pleasant View, she also excelled in track and volleyball. Her dedication to fitness continues today, as she shares workout routines and active lifestyle glimpses on Instagram and even competes in marathons. Kara’s athletic background, combined with her husband Brandon’s college football experience at the University of Utah, created a home filled with sports, guidance, and discipline that shaped Jaxson’s path to the NFL.Beyond her athletic influence, Kara is a guiding force in Jaxson’s personal and professional life. Brandon recalls a defining moment at home: “I just remember walking in the house and [Brandon] at the kitchen table and she’s kind of giving it to him, like, ‘Jax, you had a chance at that point in time to blow that dude up. We don’t take the easy way out.’ And he’s kind of sitting there like, ‘Okay mom, okay, okay.’ ”Jaxson has also shared how Kara’s pregame pep talks keep him grounded.In August 2024, he told GQ, “When I’m walking through the Walk of Champions, I’ll go see her, give her a hug, and she’ll try to hype me up. But after every little interaction, she always reminds me to slide. That’s her go-to every single time. If she thinks I didn’t hear it when I walk away, she’ll make sure to scream it even louder.”Kara’s influence isn’t limited to sports. She’s also guided Jaxson in personal style and fashion. “My mom’s into it, and she’s done a great job of letting me choose and find things that I like and just giving me options,” Dart told GQ. “At the same time, it’s just something that I’ve come to really love and to express myself in different ways…I’ve relied on her for a lot of things in the fashion world.”While the Giants face challenges on the field, including injuries and tough matchups, Jaxson’s rise brings hope to New York. And no matter the outcome, Kara Dart remains the quarterback’s biggest fan, offering unwavering support and shaping not just his game but his character.Also Read: Giants fan favorite Cam Skattebo’s girlfriend Chloe stuns in dazzling outfit against NFC East rivals Eagles","Kara Dart was born and raised in Utah and has always been a standout athlete.

The Man Who took the life of TikToker Yoon Ji-ah — The Dark Truth Behind “Black Cat”

The digital world in South Korea is mourning after losing Yoon Ji-ah who was known for being a TikToker and live streamer with more than 300,000 fans. On September 11, she was found dead on a secluded mountain in Muju County, North Jeolla Province, only a few hours after her last live stream. The terrifying circumstances of her passing have once again raised the issues of the dark side of fan communities and influencer security in the era of the internet.Police have indicated that Yoon Ji-ah met with her death about 30 minutes after cutting off her last stream. The 30-year-old digital star was pronounced dead with serious physical injuries inflicted on her body through beating, strangling, and asphyxias. Later, the medical examiner declared the cause of death to be suffocation from neck compression.Initially, the fan's affection reportedly transformed into obsession. Choi, who presented himself as a CEO enjoying success, was actually an individual who had gotten into deep financial trouble and lost his home through auction. He had created a fake persona and was financially supported which led him to create a close bond with Yoon and even convince her to go into business together.But there were reports about Yoon having recently sought to break the ties claiming controlling behavior and demanding schedule as reasons. The CCTV clips released by the detectives showed Choi kneeling and asking for forgiveness just before the tragic event. As per his later confession, he dragged her into her car before killing.After the murder, Choi made an effort to hide his actions, dressing up with a suitcase, and taking several stops to misdirect the police before he left Yoon's body on the mountainside. He was captured 12 hours after the incident. He first proclaimed his innocence but later admitted it when the police found the corpse.The death of Yoon Ji-ah has created a wave of nationwide protests and mourning compared to which the calls for more effective safety measures for content creators against the obsessive online behavior are stronger than ever. Her death serves as a grim reminder of the dangers influencers face, prompting urgent calls for stronger digital safety laws, mental health awareness, and accountability within online communities to prevent similar tragedies.","Yoon Ji-ah was found dead on a mountain in North Jeolla Province, South Korea.

Lamar Jackson’s Hamstring injury raises questions about Ravens ’ 2025 Season



Ravens navigate early-season struggles as Lamar Jackson’s recovery timeline remains uncertain

The Baltimore Ravens have had a rough start to the 2025 NFL season, struggling to maintain momentum amid key injuries. The latest blow came in Week 4 when star quarterback Lamar Jackson exited the game against the Kansas City Chiefs with a hamstring injury. With Baltimore sitting at 1-3, the team faces mounting pressure to navigate the season without its franchise quarterback.Lamar Jackson suffered a hamstring injury during the third quarter of Baltimore’s clash with the Chiefs, leaving fans and analysts concerned about his availability in upcoming games. The injury occurred on the final play of the Ravens’ offensive drive, and Jackson did not return when the offense regained possession. While initially listed as questionable, he remained sidelined, signaling that the injury could be more serious than first anticipated.Reports from the Baltimore Sun suggest Jackson could be out for 2-3 weeks, although Ian Rapoport described the situation as “week to week,” highlighting the uncertainty surrounding his recovery. Jackson missed Week 5’s matchup against the Houston Texans and, as of October 9, has not yet resumed practice.According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, “No practice today for either Ravens QB Lamar Jackson (hamstring) or Cardinals QB Kyler Murray (foot).” The Ravens now prepare to face the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday, October 12, without their star quarterback.Head coach Jim Harbaugh confirmed that Jackson would not have been able to return to the game even if it had been closer, emphasizing the severity of the injury. Sources reported by Josina Anderson indicate that Jackson may not return until after Baltimore’s Week 7 bye week, which could provide a small silver lining for the team as it gives him additional recovery time.The timing of Jackson’s injury comes at a challenging period for the Ravens, with multiple defensive injuries compounding the team’s struggles. Losing a key player like Jackson not only affects offensive efficiency but also puts added pressure on Baltimore’s backup quarterbacks to step up. How the Ravens adjust in the coming weeks could determine whether they recover from this early-season slump or continue to fall behind in the competitive AFC North.The bye week provides a potential window for Lamar Jackson’s return, giving Baltimore time to regroup. The team’s resilience and ability to adapt will be critical as the Ravens aim to salvage their 2025 season.Also Read: Why Fox pulled Mark Sanchez — Here’s who steps into the booth for Sunday’s Seahawks vs. Jaguars clash","Lamar Jackson suffered a hamstring injury during the third quarter of Baltimore’s clash with the Chiefs.

Women's World Cup prediction: Greenstone Lobo explains which team has best chance to win

Poll What does India's loss mean for their World Cup campaign? A wake-up call for the team No big impact, they will bounce back It shows they have weaknesses to address

NEW DELHI: India captain Harmanpreet Kaur minced no words after her team's shocking three-wicket loss to South Africa in the ICC Women's World Cup on Thursday, admitting that her top order failed to take responsibility when it mattered most.“We didn't take the responsibility as a top order,” Harmanpreet said bluntly after the match. “We have to change things. We have to get good totals. It is a long tournament, and there are lots of learnings. We need to keep ourselves in a positive frame of mind.”India, reeling at 102 for six, were rescued by Richa Ghosh's breathtaking 94 off 77 balls, studded with 11 fours and five sixes, lifting the side to 251. However, South Africa's Nadine de Klerk (84 not out off 54) and skipper Laura Wolvaardt (70) guided their team to a memorable victory, handing India their first defeat of the campaign.“It was a tough game,” Harmanpreet reflected. “Both teams played really well. Even though we collapsed while batting, we still managed to put 250 on the board. In the end, Chloe (Tryon) and de Klerk batted beautifully. They showed it was a very good pitch and they deserved to win.”The Indian skipper, however, was all praise for her wicketkeeper-batter, whose heroics went in vain. “Richa has been outstanding for us. Today we were very pleased to see her hitting.She can get the big totals — hope she continues.”For South Africa, de Klerk was understandably ecstatic after being named Player of the Match. “I'm lost for words,” she said. “No bigger stage than playing India at home. We had to take it deep, and Chloe took the pressure off me. We're capable of beating the best sides.”Wolvaardt echoed her teammate's sentiments, hailing de Klerk's fearless hitting. “I don't think I've seen something like that in my career. It was a special innings,” she said. “She's been hitting like that in the nets, and I'm glad it came off today.”","India captain Harmanpreet Kaur says her top order failed to take responsibility.

Rohit Sharma removed as India ODI captain, a glorious era comes to an end

Poll Do you agree with Sourav Ganguly's view that relieving Rohit Sharma of his ODI captaincy was a natural progression? Yes, it was a natural progression No, it feels like a sacking Not sure

NEW DELHI: Former India captain and ex-BCCI president Sourav Ganguly has defended the decision to relieve Rohit Sharma of his ODI captaincy, insisting it was not a sacking but a natural progression in a player’s career. Ganguly drew parallels to his own career and that of Rahul Dravid , both of whom faced similar transitions as they approached the twilight of their playing days.“I’m sure Rohit must have been spoken to. I’m not sure if it’s sacking. I’m sure it’s a mutual discussion,” Ganguly told India Today. “Rohit has been an outstanding leader — he’s won the T20 World Cup and Champions Trophy . Performance is not the issue with Rohit Sharma. In 2027, Rohit will be 40. That’s a big number in sport. It happened to me, it happened to Dravid… it happens to everyone. Even Shubman Gill will face the same at 40.”Ganguly also backed the selection committee’s move to appoint Shubman Gill as India’s new ODI captain. He highlighted Gill’s impressive performance during India’s five-Test series in England this summer, where the young skipper amassed 754 runs, including four centuries — surpassing historic records by Graham Gooch and Sunil Gavaskar.“Not a bad decision to promote Gill. He’s shown a lot of talent in England. I think it’s a fair call… Rohit can keep playing while you groom a young captain,” Ganguly said.“It’s too early, but the way he has played and captained the team is extraordinary. Lots of potential, both as a player and as a captain.”On Rohit’s future, Ganguly stressed the importance of domestic cricket in maintaining form and fitness, noting that age will eventually factor into team selection. “Yes, 40 is a lot of age. It depends on how fit he stays, how much cricket he plays, and how many runs he scores. Whatever opportunity they get, they have to play domestic cricket. That’s what it is — cricket is a sport where you have to keep playing to stay sharp,” he was quoted as saying by PTI.Ganguly concluded by underlining that transitions are a part of sport and no player is immune. “It happens to everyone. Whether it’s Federer, Nadal, or Maradona, everyone has to finish someday. Rohit’s contribution will always be remembered, and the future is now about Gill leading the side forward.”India will begin their ODI campaign under Gill’s leadership with a three-match series in Australia starting October 19, followed by a five-match T20I series from October 29.",Sourav Ganguly defends decision to relieve Rohit Sharma of ODI captaincy.

Poll Should Sanju Samson have been included in India's ODI squad for Australia? Yes No

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif believes that Sanju Samson should have been part of India’s ODI squad for the upcoming tour of Australia, calling him a better fit for the lower middle order than Dhruv Jurel, who was selected as the wicketkeeper-batter.While acknowledging Jurel’s impressive performance in the ongoing Test series against the West Indies at home, Kaif said Samson’s six-hitting ability and experience in Australian conditions could have been more valuable.“I feel that Dhruv Jurel played really well when he scored that century (against WI). He looked very compact and organized, and he is definitely the future of Indian cricket. He has that ability to score in every match. But leaving out Sanju Samson was a wrong decision because Sanju usually plays in the lower order, around number 5 or 6, and for that position, he is a much better option than Jurel,” Kaif said on his YouTube channel.Jurel, who is part of the current Test side, has been named in the 15-member ODI squad for the three-match series starting October 19 in Perth. However, KL Rahul is expected to keep wickets during the ODIs, with Samson returning for the T20I leg later this month.Kaif felt that Samson’s ability to clear the boundary consistently, especially against spinners, makes him a better choice for the middle order. “At that spot, you need someone who can hit sixes, especially against spinners. We saw Sanju Samson’s strength in the Asia Cup. If he had gone to Australia, he would have hit Adam Zampa for maximums. He’s in the top 10 for most sixes in the IPL, and he fits perfectly at number 5 or 6 in Australian conditions,” Kaif added.The former India batter also cautioned against judging selections solely on short-term form. “Right now, we tend to focus only on current form, like how well Jurel played recently, and in doing so, we forget players like Sanju who have been performing consistently and are deserving,” he said.The India-Australia ODI series begins October 19, followed by five T20Is from October 29.","Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif believes that Sanju Samson should have been part of India's ODI squad for the upcoming tour of Australia.

NEW DELHI: Can a lopsided Test series still create narratives compelling enough to retain dwindling spectator interest? Or will the relentless smash and grab for World Test Championship points further drain the soul and context out of an already endangered format?This is the big-picture scenario in play as the Ferzoeshah Kotla prepares to roll out Round Two of the India-West Indies non-rivalry here from Friday. With Ahmedabad having served up a dull-as-dishwater exhibition of India’s unmatched superiority and Roston Chase’s men already giving out nervy vibes, expectations aren’t that high.Any semblance of a contest here would entail heroic deeds of miraculous proportions from a dispirited and long-suffering Windies, who so far haven’t looked like they have any business sharing the Test stage with some more accomplished teams. Or conversely, it could involve India playing well beneath their potential or experimenting wildly, none of which seems to be an eventuality given the WTC points at stake.So expect India to be ruthless and West Indies to be shaky, leaving the responsibility of springing surprises to the whimsies of the multi-day format and the slightly damp and cooler early October conditions here.The lack of any real excitement left one captain — Roston Chase — musing on his team’s lack of selfbelief and motivation on matcheve. That left his counterpart Shubman Gill to point out why Test cricket, now served on the altar of a quasi-league format sustained especially by such mismatches, should still matter.“It’s the ICC’s decision whether (to split Test teams) into a two-tiered system but as a cricketing nation, if your red-ball base is strong, you automatically do well in ODIs and T20s,” Gill said. “If you look at any of the teams — England, Australia — if the Test teams are very good, it’s a natural thing that your ODI and T20 teams will do well.”The rankings seem to bear Gill out, with West Indies No. 8 in Tests to India’s No. 4 and No. 9 in the 50-over format (India top the table). “I don’t know,” Gill said when asked to explain West Indies’ era-spanning downward spiral, before offering, “Maybe their (West Indies) players’ focus is more on T20 and leagues. So if your focus is on that, then the base from where the game has started, when you forget that, then the struggle of any country starts from there. ”Chase, who is all too aware that the team has slipped in T20Is as well (they are No. 6 to India’s No.1), said the dip in self-belief may have a lot to do with the dearth of quality first-class cricket. “Red-ball cricket is the foundation. If you can play the longer format well, it’s easier to adapt to ODIs and T20s but the reverse is tough. A strong base in redball cricket teaches you discipline, technique and temperament.“It comes down to confidence and playing enough quality first-class cricket. The more time you spend facing good bowling attacks, the more you learn to handle pressure and improve on your weaknesses. When you start your career, opponents don’t know much about you but after a few matches they pick on your flaws. It’s up to the players to identify those areas early,” Chase said.Only one thing is sure — improvements can’t happen in the heat and dust of a subcontinental Test arena. With the bat, the West Indies lasted 44.1 overs in the first innings in Ahmedabad and 45.1 in the second, so showing spine and playing out some overs will be their first priority.Already without their best pacers, the inclusion of the left-arm pace of Jediah Blades is unlikely to rattle India, who go in with questions over the form of Sai Sudharsan and the role Nitish Kumar Reddy is expected to play. The side is spin heavy, bats deep and given the cooler conditions, the Kotla may not crack up quickly enough, meaning the pacers might be in play early on too. Winning any Test isn’t easy but India seem up to the task.",India take on West Indies in the second Test at the Ferzoeshah Kotla in New Delhi.

Indian opener Smriti Mandhana etched her name in history on Thursday, becoming the highest run-getter in women’s ODIs in a single calendar year during India’s ICC Women’s World Cup clash against South Africa in Visakhapatnam.Mandhana broke Belinda Clark’s 28-year-old record when she struck a six off Ayabonga Khaka in the eighth over of the innings. Clark had amassed 970 runs in 1997, which was a record that stood unmatched until Mandhana’s stellar 2025 run.The 29-year-old southpaw, who began the match on 959 runs, crossed the milestone in style before departing for 23 in the 11th over. Following her dismissal, Mandhana’s 2025 tally stands at 982 runs in 17 matches, scored at an average of 57.76 and a strike rate of 112.22, with four centuries and three fifties. Her highest score this year remains 135, and she has hit 122 fours and 24 sixes.Mandhana’s record-breaking form has been a highlight of India’s unbeaten run in the World Cup so far. Despite modest starts in the earlier games with scores of 8 and 23 against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, the opener has been India’s most consistent performer in the format this year.She is also inching closer to another milestone, which is the 5,000-run mark in ODIs, which will make her only the second Indian woman and the fifth overall to reach that landmark.The match in Visakhapatnam, delayed by rain for an hour, saw South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt opt to field first. India made one change, bringing back Amanjot Kaur for Renuka Singh Thakur, while South Africa included Tumi Sekhukhune in place of Masabata Klaas.India will face Australia on Sunday, while South Africa take on Bangladesh in the next fixture at the same venue.For now, though, the day belonged to Smriti Mandhana , whose dominance with the bat has redefined consistency in women’s ODI cricket.","Smriti Mandhana now holds the record for most ODI runs in a calendar year. 29-year-old broke Belinda Clark’s 28-year old record when she struck a six off Ayabonga Khaka in the eighth over of the innings.

How India can qualify for Women's World Cup semifinals

India's remaining matches in the 2025 Women's World Cup:

against England on October 19 in Indore

against New Zealand on October 23 in Navi Mumbai

against Bangladesh on October 26 in Navi Mumbai.

The Indian women's cricket team faced their first setback in the 2025 ICC Women's Cricket World Cup, losing to South Africa by three wickets at the Dr. YS Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium in Visakapatnam on Thursday. The defeat came after India's strong start with two consecutive victories against Sri Lanka and Pakistan in the tournament.The loss has placed India in a challenging position as they currently stand third on the points table with four points. South Africa have shown remarkable recovery in the tournament after their initial 10-wicket loss to England, securing victories against both New Zealand and India.India's path forward in the tournament involves crucial upcoming matches against formidable opponents. The team is scheduled to face defending champions Australia on Sunday, October 12, in Visakhapatnam, followed by matches against England and New Zealand.The qualification scenario for India remains within their control, despite the recent setback. The team needs to secure victories in at least three of their remaining four matches to ensure their place in the semi-finals.However, another defeat could complicate their qualification chances, potentially making them dependent on other match results.The tournament's history provides context to India's current situation. In the 2022 World Cup, teams with three defeats managed to qualify for the next round, while India, despite winning four matches, failed to advance. This precedent suggests that India still have room for error, though securing qualification early would be more advantageous than relying on other results.",India women's cricket team lost to South Africa by three wickets in Visakhapatnam.

Enes Kanter slams LeBron James and Los Angeles Lakers for destroying Russell Westbrook’s career after 2021 disaster,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/enes-kanter-slams-lebron-james-and-los-angeles-lakers-for-destroying-russell-westbrooks-career-after-2021-disaster/articleshow/124426380.cms,"(Image Source — Getty Images)

Enes Kanter Freedom blames Los Angeles Lakers and LeBron James for Russell Westbrook’s Career Decline

Lakers sign Carmelo Anthony and Dwight Howard to strengthen championship hopes

Russell Westbrook’s Career Trajectory after leaving Los Angeles Lakers

Enes Kanter Freedom describes LeBron James as literally the dictator of the NBA

Russell Westbrook was having a great run in his career, but things took a turn while he was with the Los Angeles Lakers. Enes Kanter Freedom argues that it wasn't merely bad luck or a drop in performance, he became the scapegoat on a team led by LeBron James Was Westbrook genuinely to blame, or did the Lakers' dynamics and LeBron's influence hinder one of the most dynamic guards of his generation? The narrative of his decline is certainly worth exploring.Enes Kanter Freedom was teammates with Russell Westbrook on the Oklahoma City Thunder from 2015 to 2018. He has pointed fingers at the Los Angeles Lakers and LeBron James for ruining Westbrook's career by turning him into a scapegoat.In his Lazy Intellectuals podcast, Kanter Freedom stated, “It all started with Lakers. Look at his career as soon as he went to Lakers... if you’re playing with someone like Lebron and if the season fails then you need some kind of scapegoat. Um I think that year they picked Russell Westbrook as a scapegoat. After that look at his career right now... this guy unfortunately can’t even find a team to play right now it's tough.He added that the scapegoating affected Westbrook mentally, noting, “I think so... people were just calling some very hard names some nicknames I don't even want to repeat it I feel bad... he got a lot of kids.”Kanter Freedom talked to the podcast host about how the blame fell on Westbrook even though the whole team struggled, which hurt his reputation and confidence. This is similar to what he said in 2018 when he praised Westbrook, telling Basketball Forever, “He’s the type of guy that makes himself and everyone else around him better.”On August 6, 2021, Russell Westbrook was traded from the Washington Wizards to the Los Angeles Lakers, teaming up with LeBron James and Anthony Davis in an effort to create a championship contender following the Lakers' title win in 2020. The team also brought in veterans such as Carmelo Anthony and Dwight Howard, which increases the hopes for a successful season.The season concluded in disappointment, with the Lakers ending up 33-49 and placing 11th in the Western Conference, thus missing the playoffs altogether.In the 2021-22 season, Westbrook put up an average of 18.5 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 7.1 assists per game, but his playing style didn't mesh well with the team's overall vibe. LeBron James took on the role of the main playmaker, while Anthony Davis was the go-to second option, which restricted Westbrook's ability to handle the ball and play aggressively.Critics noted his efficiency issues, which were evident in his 29.8% shooting from three-point range and an average of 3.8 turnovers per game, especially as the team faced challenges like injuries and poor chemistry.Midway through the 2022-23 season, Westbrook got traded to the Utah Jazz and was eventually bought out.After parting ways with the Los Angeles Lakers, Russell Westbrook joined the Los Angeles Clippers in 2023, where he played for a season and a half, primarily as a bench player. He then signed a two-year veteran minimum deal with the Denver Nuggets for the 2024-25 season, participating in 75 games and averaging 13.3 points, 6.1 assists, and 4.9 rebounds per game.As of 2025, with the NBA preseason starting up, the 36-year-old Westbrook is still an unsigned free agent for the upcoming 2025-26 season. People are saying he might join the Milwaukee Bucks or get back together with Kevin Durant on the Houston Rockets, but he hasn't secured a deal yet.Enes Kanter Freedom's statements follow his trend of targeting LeBron James. In a July 2024 interview highlighted by Fox News, he claimed that Bronny James was selected by the Lakers thanks to his father, stating, “The reason that he got drafted was because of LeBron. The reason JJ Redick is the coach is because of LeBron.” He has called James “literally, like the dictator of the NBA,” claiming major free agents avoid him due to his controlling nature.Kanter Freedom, having retired in 2023, utilizes his platform for commentary, often highlighting the differences between James' influence and his own activism.Nonetheless, James still stands out as a key figure at 40, with four championship titles to his name.Also Read: NBA analyst slams San Antonio Spurs for wasting Victor Wembanyama on a roster that can’t shoot",Enes Kanter Freedom was teammates with Russell Westbrook on the Oklahoma City Thunder from 2015 to 2018.

Injury details and recovery timeline for Terry McLaurin

Impact on the Commanders' offense without Terry McLaurin

Washington Commanders wide receiver Terry McLaurin is facing increasing concerns regarding a hip flexor injury sustained during a recent practice. This injury leaves his availability for the Week 6 game with the Chicago Bears in serious doubt. McLaurin is one of the team's focal offensive weapons; if he can't go, it'd force the Commanders to adjust their game plan going forward.After being previously diagnosed with a quad issue, it's been re-evaluated as a hip flexor injury. The injury occurred during practice on Wednesday, and NFL insider Ian Rapoport reported that McLaurin is experiencing difficulty running and has been unable to practice since then. He consulted Dr. William Meyers, a specialist in core muscle injuries, to see how serious it was.The Commanders did not place McLaurin on injured reserve, a sign the team is still optimistic about his prognosis. Coach Dan Quinn said simply that the added day before a road game against the Chicago Bears on Monday night ""might help"" McLaurin recover.McLaurin being out is a big loss for the Commanders' offense. The team has already lost wide receiver Noah Brown and guard Sam Cosmi to injuries in the game.Even with those absences, QB Jayden Daniels, who missed the previous two games with a knee sprain, was back in the lineup in Week 5 and helped the team secure a road win at the L.A. Chargers.Also Read: Terry McLaurin, Noah Brown, and Sam Cosmi won’t play vs. Chargers as Commanders deal with key injuries Without McLaurin, the Commanders would likely have to lean even more on other receivers like Deebo Samuel, who has been battling a heel injury but is expected to go vs. And practice squad-turned finisher Tay Martin could also see integrated into the offense even more, in addition to tight end Zach Ertz.As the Commanders prepare for their Week 6 game, the status of McLaurin remains uncertain. The team will continue to monitor his recovery and make decisions based on his progress in the coming days.",Washington Commanders wide receiver Terry McLaurin is facing increasing concerns regarding a hip flexor injury sustained during a recent practice.

High stakes and uncertain future for Bill Belichick at North Carolina



Bill Belichick’s first season at North Carolina has quickly become a storm of high expectations and harsh realities. Despite the fanfare surrounding the hiring of the six-time Super Bowl-winning NFL coach, the Tar Heels are struggling on the field, leaving many to question whether the move will pay off. With blowout losses, sparse crowds, and a program in transition, Belichick faces challenges far different from those he conquered in New England.Bill Belichick’s initial months in Chapel Hill have been turbulent. North Carolina sits at 2-3, scoring just four touchdowns in losses to power-conference opponents, each defeat by at least 25 points. In league play, the Tar Heels rank last in scoring offense and near the bottom in both total offense and third-down conversions. Defensive numbers are equally concerning, with the team allowing over 416 yards per game and struggling to stop third-down conversions.The first home games offered little comfort. On Labor Day, TCU dominated UNC 48-14, sending fans home before the third quarter ended. Against Clemson, Kenan Stadium was mostly empty by halftime after a 28-3 start. Belichick acknowledged the difficulties while emphasizing patience: “We’re just going to keep working every day and every week…Just take it week by week.”UNC’s administration remains committed to Belichick despite early struggles. Chancellor Lee Roberts urged patience, noting that building a competitive program “takes time.” Athletic director Bubba Cunningham and Belichick himself reassured fans on social media of their dedication to the program, highlighting a long-term vision rather than short-term results.The stakes are high, both financially and reputationally. Belichick’s contract guarantees $10 million annually, with staff deals totaling over $30 million, making any coaching change costly. General manager Michael Lombardi has outlined a plan to rebuild through recruiting, aiming to bring in up to 40 high school players next year, signaling a multi-year strategy.Yet critics remain skeptical. Analyst Josh Pate has openly questioned the decision to hire Belichick, noting the gap between NFL success and college football realities. “Most people who observe college football on a ground level looked and said, ‘Do what?’” Pate said, suggesting that UNC’s lofty expectations may be unrealistic. With only five games played, the program faces uncertainty, and some believe Belichick may not return for a second season.For now, Belichick and his staff are focused on improvement, game by game. But as losses mount and expectations collide with reality, the Tar Heels’ bold experiment with one of football’s most iconic coaches has quickly become one of the sport’s most closely watched storylines.Also Read: Micah Parsons blasts Eagles’ strategy in 4-words after controversial consecutive tush pushes on Giants","Bill Belichick’s first season at North Carolina has quickly become a storm of high expectations and harsh realities.
