The Indian American author, who became the prize's youngest-ever winner in 2006 with her second novel 'The Inheritance of Loss', is now among 13 writers vying for the literary trophy.Her mother Anita Desai - with whom she shares an inheritance, not of loss but of fine storytelling - has been shortlisted for the Booker thrice but never won. After her win, Kiran acknowledged the debt: ""I wrote this book so much in my mother's company that it feels almost like her book.' While the two craft very different literary landscapes, they do have many things in common, including the habit of escaping to Mexican villages to write. The 88-year-old Anita's last novella 'Rosarita', which released last year, was also set in Mexico.Kiran's longlisted 'The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny' which will be out in Sept, has taken almost two decades to take shape. By her own admission, she writes slowly, piecing her novels together like a jigsaw puzzle. Going by the promos, the storyline seems almost filmi: a love story about two young people who first see each other on a train.But, as always, she remains conscious of her role in the wider world, exploring themes like migration, modernity, and the complicated bonds that link one generation to the next.""Intimate in its details, epic in its reach,"" is how Manasi Subramaniam, editor-in-chief at Penguin Random House India, describes it. ""While it is about the weight of familial love, the violence of class and the ache of displacement, it is sharp, funny, tragic and endlessly surprising,"" says Subramaniam.","Kiran Desai, 53, is among 13 writers vying for the literary trophy.

Poll What do you think was the key factor in India's remarkable draw at Old Trafford? Washington Sundar's performance Ravindra Jadeja's contribution Team's ability to absorb pressure England's missed opportunities

“Grateful for the people, and forever grateful to you, God,” wrote Washington Sundar on X after scoring his maiden Test hundred — a composed, unbeaten 101* that helped India pull off a dramatic draw against England in the fourth Test at Old Trafford.The 25-year-old all-rounder’s quiet gratitude came after a loud statement on the field, where he and Ravindra Jadeja (107) batted through the final phase of Day 5 to rescue India from what once looked like certain defeat. Reduced to 0/2 at the start of their second innings, India needed a miracle. They found it in the form of a rock-solid batting effort, with Shubman Gill (103) and KL Rahul (90) also playing key roles.The final session was filled with tension — England’s frustration began to show, especially after Jadeja launched a six off Harry Brook to reach his hundred. In a curious moment, Brook stepped forward with a handshake offer, seemingly looking to wrap up the game.But Sundar , just short of his own milestone, ignored the gesture and carried on. The image of Brook’s puzzled smile and Sundar’s calm focus summed up the psychological edge India held at the end.This was just the second draw for England in 40 Tests under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, which was a rare occurrence in their aggressive ‘Bazball’ era. But it was a deserved result for India, whose batters absorbed immense pressure to ensure the series stays alive at 2-1.With the possibility of leveling the series still on the line, the stage is set for a cracking finale at The Oval. But for now, Sundar’s words and his resolve linger as the high point of a chaotic final day.",Washington Sundar scored 101* to help India draw 4th Test at Old Trafford. Ravindra Jadeja (107) and Shubman Gill (103) also made centuries. England were reduced to 0/2 at the start of their second innings.

Trade Outlook: A Deal Waiting to Happen?

With the 2025-26 NBA season approaching and theretooling for a serious title push, one key veteran could find himself on the trade block. According to a report by Devon Platana, forwardmay be the most likely Laker to be moved before opening night, as the franchise evaluates its options under the constraints of the salary cap.The Los Angeles Lakers ’ offseason moves have reshaped the team’s identity. Key acquisitions — including Deandre Ayton, Marcus Smart, and Jake LaRavia — have significantly improved head coach JJ Redick’s depth chart. But as the team eyes additional roster upgrades, especially on the wings, financial flexibility becomes a necessity.Given the Lakers’ current cap situation, further additions will likely require a trade, and Vanderbilt’s name continues to surface as a logical piece to be moved.Jarred Vanderbilt, acquired by the Lakers during the 2022-23 season, has had a turbulent tenure in Los Angeles. Known for his defensive versatility and hustle, his potential has been overshadowed by an ongoing struggle with injuries.Vanderbilt has only played in 65 regular-season contests and five playoff games since the beginning of the 2023-24 season, raising concerns about his reliability. Despite his effort on the court, availability remains a major issue. Jarred Vanderbilt is currently under contract for approximately $24 million over the next two seasons, and holds a $13.2 million player option for 2027-28. For a player who hasn’t been consistently available, this is a significant cap hit — especially for a team looking to compete at the highest level.Offloading Vanderbilt’s deal could open doors for the Lakers to pursue a more durable and productive veteran wing — a position that remains an area of need.Whether used in a straight salary dump or as part of a multi-player deal for a proven contributor, Vanderbilt’s expiring deal and defensive skill set could still be appealing to certain teams. However, his durability issues may limit the Lakers’ leverage in negotiations.As Devon Platana puts it: “He just isn’t the player L.A. needs him to be.” That statement encapsulates the shift in perception around Vanderbilt — from valuable rotation piece to trade candidate.The NBA offseason has already featured surprise trades, and Jarred Vanderbilt could be the next domino to fall. With the Lakers aggressively looking to maximize LeBron James’ and Anthony Davis’ remaining prime years, every roster spot matters. If Vanderbilt is unable to prove his durability before the season begins, his time in Los Angeles may indeed be coming to an end.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Potentially Eyeing Reunion With $2,291,897 Toronto Raptors Center to support LeBron James and Luka Donic As the summer progresses, expect the Lakers to explore all options — and that includes potentially saying goodbye to a familiar face in Jarred Vanderbilt.","Los Angeles Lakers forward Jarred Vanderbilt is under contract for $24 million over the next two seasons.

Dallas Mavericks’ Motivation: Now or Never?

Los Angeles Lakers’ Perspective: Holding the Cards

My Verdict on the Trade

Thehave emerged as a dark horse in thesweepstakes, with new reports suggesting that the team is seriously evaluating the possibility of acquiring the four-time NBA champion. Though LeBron has opted into the final year of his contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, The Athletic’s John Hollinger revealed that James showed serious interest in joining Dallas before making that decision.According to Bleacher Report’s Dan Favale, “Are we just supposed to believe he’s no longer intrigued by the prospect of reuniting with both Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving?”—a question that points to the ongoing intrigue surrounding the potential formation of a new super team in Texas.The idea of LeBron James playing alongside Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving is more than just fantasy. It’s grounded in both basketball chemistry and off-court relationships. James has previously expressed admiration for both stars, and his history with Irving is well documented—from their championship run in Cleveland to an up-and-down but ultimately successful on-court partnership.For Dallas, the potential acquisition of LeBron would be less about age and more about capitalizing on a small window.Even at 40, James averaged 25.7 points, 8.3 assists, and 7.3 rebounds in the 2023-24 season. His impact goes beyond numbers—his leadership, playoff experience, and basketball IQ are unmatched.Despite the appeal, Dallas faces serious logistical challenges. LeBron’s $52.7 million salary for the 2024-25 season is the first hurdle. While offseason rules allow teams to exceed the non-taxpayer mid-level exception to acquire buyout players, that doesn’t apply in this case since James is under contract.To make a deal work, the Dallas Mavericks would need to offload a significant portion of their roster. That could mean surrendering four to five players, as well as including draft capital.And even this framework may not be enough unless a third or fourth team is looped in to absorb salary or provide additional assets. The Lakers , meanwhile, are unlikely to take back long-term salary, as they are believed to be pursuing future cap space aggressively.What makes this pursuit different is Dallas’ sense of urgency. Coming off a Finals loss and looking to maximize Anthony Davis’ remaining years, the Mavericks are clearly open to high-stakes, high-reward moves. Pairing Anthony with LeBron and Kyrie could create one of the most formidable offensive trios in NBA history, if not the most experienced.Still, LeBron entering his age-41 season raises concerns. There’s no guarantee that the 20-time All-Star will maintain his elite level of play deep into the next campaign. But for a franchise that hasn’t won a title since 2011, the gamble might be worth the upside.From the Lakers’ standpoint, letting go of LeBron James isn’t as simple as it looks. Though he’s near the end of his career, James remains their most valuable asset—on the court and in marketing. Trading him for a package of role players and picks might not align with the franchise’s long-term plans unless it frees them to land a major star or opens up cap flexibility.The Mavericks’ rumored interest in LeBron James is more than just smoke—it’s a calculated, if risky, pursuit of championship relevance. As Dan Favale notes, “Bringing in LeBron is one thing if he’s coming off a buyout… It is another venture entirely when you have to account for his $52.7 million salary.”Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Potentially Eyeing Reunion With $2,291,897 Toronto Raptors Center to support LeBron James and Luka Donic Whether Dallas can pull off this blockbuster remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the Mavericks are not content to stand still.

NHL insider reveals league-wide hesitation toward Carter Hart despite court ruling

NHL's decision lies with Gary Bettman , not the courts

FAQs

1. Can Carter Hart sign with any NHL team now?

2. Was Carter Hart found guilty in the Hockey Canada case?

3. Who decides Carter Hart's eligibility to return?

Despite being cleared of criminal charges in the Hockey Canada sexual assault trial, former Philadelphia Flyers goaltender Carter Hart’s NHL return is far from guaranteed. According to insider Frank Seravalli, Hart remains a “non-starter” for the Edmonton Oilers and, troublingly, for the rest of the league as well.In a revealing appearance on B/R Open Ice, Frank Seravalli explained that Hart's legal acquittal has not translated into NHL eligibility.“I was told that Carter Hart is a non-starter for the Edmonton Oilers, and beyond that, he's a non-starter for everyone right now, coming off of his acquittal in the Hockey Canada sexual assault case in court in London, Ontario, as ruled upon last week,” Seravalli said.Hart, along with four other former NHLers, was found not guilty in court. However, Seravalli clarified that the league continues to treat them as “ineligible,” with the NHL Commissioner’s office still reviewing the file.“Look, he's - him and the other four former NHL players have been labeled by the NHL as ineligible, and they're going to continue to review the file before determining next steps in the commissioner's office…” he added.Even though Hart could technically sign with any team once cleared, the power lies squarely with Commissioner Gary Bettman.The court may have dismissed criminal charges, but it did not absolve the players of actions the league deems “detrimental.”As Seravalli emphasized, “…so until they are cleared to play, it's not even really a conversation worth having, even though the NHLPA has strongly voiced their objection to how the NHL has viewed this situation.”The critical detail here is that the NHL’s collective bargaining agreement gives Bettman sweeping authority to determine a player's eligibility, irrespective of courtroom outcomes. That means unless the Commissioner changes his stance, Hart’s NHL career may remain indefinitely on pause.Also Read: Connor McDavid Trade Rumors: NHL MVP might follow Auston Matthews’ lead to control his future in Edmonton No, not until he’s officially cleared to play by the NHL.No, he was acquitted of all criminal charges in court.NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has final say over his playing status.","NHL insider reveals league-wide hesitation toward Carter Hart despite court ruling.

Penguins’ rebuild could trigger blockbuster deal if Sidney Crosby waives no-trade clause

Proposed trade package includes Martin Necas, top prospect, and two first-round picks

FAQs

1: Could Sidney Crosby be traded by the Penguins?

2: Which team is being linked to a potential Sidney Crosby trade?



3: What might the Penguins receive in return for Sidney Crosby?

Sidney Crosby could head west to the Colorado Avalanche, the trade rumours suggest. The Pittsburgh Penguins, eyeing a rebuild, might acquire Martin Necas, Sean Behrens, and future draft picks in return. Nevertheless, Crosby's no-trade clause and loyalty to Pittsburgh remain significant hurdles, potentially preventing any move despite speculation.Conjecture about hockey superstar Sidney Crosby's future continues to circulate, with a notable ice hockey pundit, Mike Rupp, implying a dramatic westward move to the Colorado Avalanche. This idea stems from the Pittsburgh franchise's slated restructuring and the notion that Crosby might seek to conclude his career with a team braced for a championship.During a recent segment on NHL Network, Rupp analysed the feasibility of such a significant player exchange. While he stopped short of declaring it an immediate prospect, he emphasized that if Pittsburgh were indeed to consider parting ways with Crosby, the Avalanche would be the chosen destination.Rupp's hypothetical trade scenario visualised the Penguins acquiring forward Martin Necas, a promising defenseman in Sean Behrens, and a pair of first-round draft selections from Colorado.Necas, ostensibly ""disenchanted with his time in Colorado,"" as underscored in a Denver publication from mid-July, appears to be a key component, especially given his impending unrestricted free agency and Pittsburgh's capacity to meet his ""reported $10 million price tag."" The accrual of future draft picks aligns with Pittsburgh's potential need for rebuilding assets, and Behrens represents a valuable youth element.Nevertheless, a significant impediment to this monumental shift is Crosby's contractual ""full no-trade clause,"" granting him ultimate authority over any potential shift. His deep-rooted ""allegiance to the Penguins"" indicates a strong desire to remain in Pittsburgh, making a departure far-fetched.Nonetheless, a transfer to the Avalanche might be an exception due to his personal ties with Nathan MacKinnon, both hailing from Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia. Yet, even with these connections, convincing Crosby to ""waive his no-trade clause at this point in his career"" seems highly dubious.The popular belief is that Crosby would only consider a change of scenery for a shot at another championship. But with ""three Cup rings"" already adorning his resume, the pursuit of a fourth may not supersede his dedication to ""cementing his legacy in Pittsburgh forever,"" even if it means finishing his career with a developing team and ""little hope of competing any time soon.”Even with trade talk swirling, Sid's deep loyalty to the Penguins and his no-trade clause make him leaving highly unlikely.

He likened Luka Doncic ’s journey to those of greats like Michael Jordan, Giannis Antetokounmpo , and Nikola Jokic—players who all underwent physical and mental evolutions before reaching their peak. Doncic, already a five-time top-five MVP vote-getter, averaged 28.2 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 7.7 assists last season—even while battling late-game fatigue and defensive inconsistencies.Kendrick Perkins argues that with better conditioning and a deeper Lakers roster around him, Luka Doncic can now perform at a sustained, dominant level without the lapses that previously weakened his MVP case.Not all experts are sold on the idea that a leaner Luka automatically equals an MVP season. ESPN’s David Dennis Jr. was particularly blunt: “We’re discussing a player who should be aiming for MVP status, yet we’re applauding him for being in shape?…Being in shape doesn’t prevent you from losing focus on back screens or being left isolated during the playoffs.”Stephen A. Smith echoed similar sentiments, warning fans and analysts alike to wait and see if Doncic’s improved fitness leads to defensive consistency and postseason durability. For some, the challenge lies not in Luka’s physical readiness, but his leadership, mental focus, and ability to close out high-pressure games.Luka Doncic’s arrival in Los Angeles comes with massive expectations, especially after Dallas parted ways with him due to ongoing concerns about his conditioning. Early signs suggest he’s embracing a leadership role, helping to bring in key names like Deandre Ayton and Marcus Smart, and fully buying into the Lakers’ system.NBA insider Tim Bontemps believes Doncic’s MVP chances hinge on team success: “If the Lakers are in the 50-plus win range, and Luka is playing like he did two years ago, before he had the injuries and everything last year, Luka’s going to have a shot [at the MVP award].”Luka Doncic’s transformation goes well beyond surface-level buzz. It represents a turning point—one where he appears fully engaged, motivated, and willing to make the sacrifices necessary to lead a franchise. Whether it culminates in the MVP trophy, as Kendrick Perkins boldly suggests, depends on whether “Skinny Luka” can deliver more than just an improved physique—he’ll need wins, leadership, and postseason excellence.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Dallas Mavericks Weigh Risky but Ambitious Move for $52.6 Million Los Angeles Lakers Legend to form Big 3 with Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving Regardless of how it unfolds, Luka Doncic’s next season promises to be his most compelling yet.","Luka Doncic’s dramatic offseason body transformation has drawn praise, skepticism, and bold forecasts.

It is to be noted that Hulk Hogan passed away on July 24, 2025, leaving fans and the WWE Universe mourning and devastated at his sudden demise.As per reports, Hulk Hogan succumbed after suffering a cardiac arrest at his Clearwater residence in Florida. The WWE legend is survived by his wife, Sky Daily, and his children from his previous marriage to Linda Hogan.Although Hulk Hogan’s life always revolved around controversy. His former wife, Linda Hogan, has now stirred a fresh controversy by posting a video of her daughter Brooke Hogan, claiming that she won’t attend her father’s funeral. Let’s take a look at the details of the video.Linda Hogan has recently shared a video of Brooke Hogan claiming that she won’t attend her father Hulk Hogan's funeral. The WWE Hall of Famer’s former wife has stirred controversy this time by posting a controversial video of their daughter, who wants nothing to do with the family or her father’s funeral.On July 28, Linda took to Facebook and shared a short clip of Brooke falsely claiming that she wouldn’t attend Hulk Hogan’s funeral due to past trauma. The video was shocking, with Brooke supposedly accusing both of her parents of abuse, blasting her mother’s behavior after the divorce, and disowning her father entirely.The video posted by Linda said, “I will not attend Hulk Hogan’s funeral even if he were my father. But he also caused me great harm. Even if he called me before he died and said I love you, I wouldn’t believe it. When I was 19, Hulk Hogan had a relationship with my friend Christian Fonte. I felt ashamed and angry. Later, when I dated a black boyfriend, he attacked me with racist words.”She could be further seen saying, “I did defend his image in the media, but that was only because I didn’t want to expose the ugliness of this family to the public. I hate my parents, including my mother, Linda Hogan, who quickly got a boyfriend younger than me after the divorce. She only cared about her new life and never cared about me.”Brooke further pointed fingers at her mother. She added, “Linda Hogan is best at playing the victim, but no one knows what she did to me. They both abused me, but no one believes it. That’s why I chose to distance myself from both of them. Even when I got married and had kids, I didn’t want to tell them.”Lastly, the video added, “Now that my father, Hulk Hogan, has died, I don’t care about the inheritance and I don’t want to be part of any morning media. Stop contacting me. I will not respond to anything about them.”But, there’s a twist? Later, it was found that the entire video was a fake AI-generated video of Brooke Hogan. However, it didn’t take long for several individuals in the comments section to highlight that the clip was produced by AI.The visuals seemed altered, and the voice was not in line with Brooke Hogan's actual tone. Even though she received a lot of responses pointing out the inaccuracies, Linda kept the post up, exacerbating an already fraught situation. As per reports, Hulk Hogan's funeral details are yet to be made public.Brooke Hogan is Hulk Hogan and Linda Hogan ’s daughter, whose real name is Brooke Ellen Bollea. She was born on May 5, 1988, in Tampa. Brooke followed in the footsteps of his father and was very athletic growing up, doing gymnastics and dance. In the early 2000s, Brooke embarked on a singing career, releasing her first single, ""Everything to Me,"" in 2004 and eventually touring with several big artists, including Hilary Duff and the Backstreet Boys.She appeared with her father on Inside Out: Hulk Hogan, Stage Dad, which later led to Hogan Knows Best, which portrayed Hulk's strict parenting, especially when it came to Brooke dating.In addition to her singing career, Brooke had a brief wrestling career, making her WWE debut in 2006.

NHL Trade Rumors: Nazem Kadri could join Montreal Canadiens after Toronto Maple Leafs blocked by Calgary Flames,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-nazem-kadri-could-join-montreal-canadiens-after-toronto-maple-leafs-blocked-by-calgary-flames/articleshow/122983328.cms,"Bill Wippert/Getty

Calgary Flames shut door on Toronto Maple Leafs, Nazem Kadri eyes Montreal Canadiens as realistic trade option

Montreal Canadiens could land reliable veteran Nazem Kadri with proven scoring punch and leadership

FAQs:

1. How many Stanley Cups has Nazem Kadri won?

2. When was Nazem Kadri drafted and by which team?

Nazem Kadri may be headed back to the Eastern Conference and the Montreal Canadiens could be the front-runners. With Calgary reportedly refusing to negotiate any trades with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Kadri’s list of potential destinations has effectively narrowed to just one team. Given his consistent production and Montreal’s need for veteran help up the middle, this could be a perfect short-term fit.Nazem Kadri is reportedly open to a trade to either the Montreal Canadiens or his former team, the Toronto Maple Leafs. However, with Calgary Flames management unwilling to make a deal with Toronto, still harboring friction from Brad Treliving’s tenure as Flames GM that path appears closed.Sportsnet’s Nick Kypreos reported that Treliving has previously tried to acquire players like Chris Tanev, Nikita Zadorov, and Rasmus Andersson from Calgary, but has been shut down at every turn. That history makes it highly unlikely that the Flames would greenlight any trade that sends Kadri back to the Maple Leafs.This leaves the Canadiens as the only viable trade destination Kadri would reportedly consider. Montreal’s growing core, including top prospect Ivan Demidov and head coach Martin St. Louis’ high-skill system could make the Canadiens an appealing spot for the 34-year-old centerman.Kadri is coming off back-to-back seasons of 67 and 75 points, playing a full 82 games in both campaigns.He has tallied 710 points in 985 NHL games and once posted a 100-point pace during the 2021–22 season with Colorado. At 6-foot and 185 pounds, Kadri brings experience, physicality, and versatility to any middle-six unit.With Montreal’s top prospect Michael Hage still developing, Kadri could be a strong short-term option to stabilize the Canadiens' second line alongside Demidov. His leadership and playoff pedigree would be especially valuable to a young team looking to take the next step.If Calgary refuses to deal with Toronto, the road is clear for the Montreal Canadiens to pursue Nazem Kadri. Given his proven scoring ability and desire for a fresh start, a move to Montreal could benefit both sides, if the price is right. As trade rumors heat up, the Canadiens may quietly be positioning themselves for a bold veteran addition.Kadri won one Stanley Cup with the Colorado Avalanche during the 2021–22 NHL season.Kadri was drafted 7th overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 2009 NHL Draft.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Kyle Connor likely to re-sign as Winnipeg Jets pursue long-term contract extension amid NHL free agency buzz","Nazem Kadri is reportedly open to a trade to either the Montreal Canadiens or his former team, the Toronto Maple Leafs.

Kendrick Perkins explains why Chris Paul falls outside his top 10 point guards

Chris Paul recently joined the L.A. Clippers (Image via Instagram / @cp3)

A prominent NBA analyst's list of the top ten guards in the league did not include Chris Paul, the recently acquired star of the Los Angeles Clippers. Even though ESPN's Kendrick Perkins, who played against the said player in the AAU and then the NBA, considers him to be the real ""point god,"" he places him in his Top 15 rather than the top 10. Recently, the analyst opened up about the same thing.The Los Angeles Clippers ' Chris Paul is seen by most as one of the greatest point guards ever in NBA history. The 40-year-old is now close to the end of his career as he begins his 21st season in the league. Kendrick Perkins made one comparison apparent, but he didn't provide a comprehensive list of those who rate higher than CP3. He has a higher opinion of the former Oklahoma City Thunder player Russell Westbrook.He stated during the most recent podcast episode Road Trippin’:""I don't have CP3 ranked above Russell Westbrook. Like CP3 does a lot of things, changes the franchise, win a lot of games and things? Yes, absolutely. I would never take that away from him. Since he was drafted by the Pelicans, he changed that franchise…”He continued:""He goes to the Clippers, winning organization. Goes to the Phoenix Suns, winning organization.But when it comes to rankings, you got to check those boxes and you got to have the accolades. And when I say accolades, yes, championships and Finals MVP. But CP3 don't have one MVP.""Originally broadcast on Basketball Network, Kendrick Perkins discussed why he does not consider Chris Paul to be one of the top ten point guards in NBA history:""I don't have him ranked above Russell Westbrook.”He further stated that Russell Westbrook's triple-double record-breaking games and MVP run stand out. The Milwaukee Bucks came back with four straight victories after CP3 led the Phoenix Suns to within two games of the 2021 NBA championship. After winning Game 1, Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder made it to the Finals in 2012 as well.However, it is not certain what additional accomplishments Kendrick Perkins wants for Chris Paul aside from a championship or a regular-season MVP. Meanwhile, the new L.A. Clippers’ player will always be regarded as one of the NBA's most knowledgeable and significant point guards, regardless of this comment.Also read: Chris Paul returns to Los Angeles Clippers on 1-year, $3.6M deal in what may be his farewell NBA season",Kendrick Perkins does not consider Chris Paul to be one of the top ten point guards in NBA history.

Philip Tomasino arrives in Pittsburgh Penguins at critical career turning points



Competition heats up as Tomasino battles for long-term alignment in Pittsburgh Penguins' top six



Philip Tomasino hopes to cement his NHL career with the Pittsburgh Penguins as the team makes a shift toward a younger, quicker core. Acquired from the Nashville Predators in late 2024, Philip Tomasino is a 24-year-old winger who is among general manager Kyle Dubas' calculated signings designed to add youthful energy to a roster still spearheaded by veterans Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. Now at a critical juncture, Philip Tomasino is looking to transition from a depth contributor to a consistent middle-six scorer.When the Pittsburgh Penguins sent a 2027 fourth-round draft pick to the Nashville Predators for Philip Tomasino, the trade seemed like a low-risk, high-reward gamble. For an organization that has attempted too many times to balance its legendary veteran core with sustained roster building, having a 23-year-old former first-round pick fall into their lap was Kyle Dubas' rebuild prototype to a T.Philip Tomasino signed with the Pittsburgh Penguins in November 2024 and was plugged into the NHL lineup right away. There being a depth issue in front, he played meaningful minutes, playing 50 games during the 2024–25 season. He scored 11 goals and 23 points, but consistency was still a problem. Philip Tomasino had three separate periods of six or more games without scoring a point—a habit that would keep him from rising the lineup if not addressed.Tomasino's role in the future is uncertain, partially because the Penguins have a crowded cadre of middle-six forwards. In addition to stalwarts such as Bryan Rust and Rickard Rakell, the Penguins brought in Anthony Mantha, Thomas Novak, Rutger McGroarty, and Ville Koivunen, all of whom are competing for scarce minutes alongside Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin.While the Penguins would like to shed cap space and perhaps part ways with veteran wingers Rust and Rakell, a window of opportunity can create itself. But Tomasino has to show he can do it consistently to gain a top-six spot. His one-year, $1.75 million deal is a ""show-me"" situation—he's a restricted free agent in the offseason and must have a solid season to find a long-term spot in the Penguins' plans.Kyle Dubas has made it plain that the Penguins are building for the future. The team added three forwards in the first round of the 2025 NHL Draft recently and owns 17 picks in rounds one through three in the next three drafts. There is no mistaking the message: competition will only increase, and Tomasino must adapt beyond being a streaky scorer if he wants to stay in the mix.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Kyle Connor likely to re-sign as Winnipeg Jets pursue long-term contract extension amid NHL free agency buzz Philip Tomasino heads into the 2025–26 NHL season with more chances than ever, but with more stress. If he can monetize raw talent regularly, he has a true opportunity to find a permanent role with the Pittsburgh Penguins. Surrounded by some of the best in the game and up-and-coming rivals as well, this season may set Tomasino's course in the league.

As the NFL offseason rolls into August, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott marked his 32nd birthday on Tuesday while entering what many believe is the most defining year of his career. The veteran signal-caller is heading into his 10th season with the Cowboys, and while his stat line continues to impress, questions about his postseason record and future with the franchise remain on the forefront.Prescott, now a decade into his career in Dallas, received a lighthearted birthday shoutout from the Dallas Cowboys’ official X (formerly Twitter) account: ""here we gooo 🥳 hbd qb1!""After winning Offensive Rookie of the Year in 2016 and leading the league in passing yards in 2023, Prescott has proved he can produce at a high level. He’s been named to the Pro Bowl three times and has led the Cowboys to strong regular-season finishes. What remains missing, however, is the postseason success. Prescott has just two playoff wins in nine seasons as the starter quarterback and it continues to cloud his legacy in Dallas.Even though the Dallas Cowboys haven’t won a Super Bowl since 1995, fans expect them to be championship contenders every year. Now, new head coach Brian Schottenheimer steps into that pressure-filled spotlight, bringing a straightforward approach to a team known for big expectations and bigger drama.The Cowboys had strong momentum going into 2024. In 2023, they led the NFL in scoring and ranked fifth in points allowed. A tough Wild Card loss to the Green Bay Packers ended that run, but their offense had been one of the best in the league for two straight years. Things changed fast in 2024. The offense fell apart, dropping to 21st in scoring, while the defense ranked near the bottom of the league at 31st. Schottenheimer now has the job of fixing both sides of the ball.As the 2025 NFL season opener approaches, there’s a growing belief around the league that this year could determine how the Cowboys move forward with their veteran quarterback. Dak Prescott is still the clear QB1 for them, but with no contract extension finalized, the pressure is a lot. He will need to deliver in both the regular season and the playoffs to quiet the questions about his future with the franchise.Dak Prescott has two career playoff victories since becoming the Cowboys’ starting quarterback in 2016.Yes, as of now, Prescott does not have a long-term extension in place, making this season critical for his future with the team.Dallas opens the 2025 NFL season on Thursday, September 4, with a road game against the Philadelphia Eagles.The Cowboys begin the new season on the road with a high-stakes divisional matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles on Thursday, September 4.","Dak Prescott celebrates his 32nd birthday with a shoutout from Dallas Cowboys.

Imagine the time when Deion Sanders was busy exploring his sons’ brewing NFL future, drawing clear boundaries for teams and coaches, defending Shilo and Shedeur’s volatile draft stock, and all while carrying a fatal disease in his body! Heroic! Right? Coach Prime has not only been savage and bold in front of the media, but he’s also a real fighter who can take a bullet for his kids. The Colorado Buffaloes' head coach just came out defeating a super aggressive state of bladder cancer this Monday without even letting his sons know anything.Coach Prime’s bond with his sons has been a recurring theme in the NFL and college football discussions. Starting from their off-field banter to the strict on-field discipline, the trio stands tall. When Sanders had to let them go out of Boulder last season, it marked the first time in his career that he prepared to coach a team without his sons. The 58-year-old veteran has been a rock in their sons’ careers since their days with the Jackson State Tigers.However, eventually, it was time for them to go apart no matter how hard it is. But when Sanders was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year, he decided not to distract his sons from their focus. He kept it close to his chest.

Nine months have passed since Bronny James joined the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA . In order to become a significant player, he has been working away from the spotlight for the past year. He wants to overtake several veterans on the depth chart, overcome the consequences of his heart issue, and dominate coach JJ Redick's rotation. Now, he recently revealed to ESPN that JJ Redick wants him to research T.J. McConnell and Davion Mitchell's games to get better.JJ Redick recently cited the Miami Heat' s Davion Mitchell and the Indiana Pacers’ T.J. McConnell as examples of the kind of game-changing player Bronny James can become. He said to ESPN:""The biggest thing for Bronny is that he has to get in elite shape… That's the barrier of entry for him right now. And if he does that, I think he's got a chance to be a really fantastic player in the NBA.""However, their skill sets include a two-way relentlessness that calls for a great deal of endurance, something the rookie has not been able to maintain. He further said:“On every single possession, they're in the game -- whether that's offensively or defensively -- they're able to impact it with how hard they play. With the defensive pickup points, the disruption, being able to get downhill ... I think we have all seen these amazing flashes of it from Bronny. And to get to that next level for him, it's cardio fitness…”Bronny James was the NBA's next prominent Las Vegas star three days prior, when he and the L.A.Lakers of the summer league faced the Dallas Mavericks and Cooper Flagg. The Los Angeles Lakers were defeated, and junior James missed a game-winning three-pointer in the final seconds.On the other hand, this wasn’t the first time JJ Redick was critical of the rookie NBA player. In an interview three months ago, when asked how he thought Bronny James’ first NBA season went, the head coach was quick to laud LeBron James ' son.He said via SoCal News Group:“I give him an A+. How he has personally handled a lot of attention, good and bad, he doesn’t even break character. He’s the same guy every day. He doesn’t allow the good attention to get to him, and he doesn’t allow the bad attention to get to him. He just continues to work.” LeBron James and Bronny James are undoubtedly one of the most talked-about father-son duos, and the son is just getting started. Nevertheless, he is moving up the ladder to gain recognition among the L.A. Lakers supporters and in the league.Also read: Bronny James misses game-winner as Cooper Flagg shines in gritty Mavericks win over Lakers","Bronny James is urged to study T.J.

The Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James has started playing a new sport.

There is minimal wrist mobility and a rigid, arm-dominant action in the video. He also acknowledged that it was only Day 2 in his Instagram post and made a suggestion that learning to play golf would take time and humility.Meanwhile, NBA player Jayson Tatum took to Instagram on July 29 and reacted to the viral clip of LeBron James playing the game. Praising the NBA giant, he said:“What are your thoughts? You know what? I'm just happy.I'm happy my guys out there. It's been a long time coming. Part of it you gotta get out there.

Loosing up but you won't figure it out.”Additionally, according to Newsweek, pro PGA Tour winner Min Woo Lee also joked after watching the video:""Come a long way since the topgolf video,"" while the PGA of America added, ""Someone is getting addicted to golf.”Even famous NBA player-cum-golfer Stephen Curry greeted LeBron James, saying:""We've been waiting for you.""Millions of people watched the video, which fueled summertime speculation about the NBA pro’s next move outside of basketball.Also read: ""Pls get a whole sleeve–” NBA players react to Jayson Tatum’s new tattoo reveal","NBA player Jayson Tatum praised LeBron James' golfing skills.

FAQs

Q1: Will Matthew Schaefer be playing in the NHL this season?

Q2: Is Matthew Schaefer fully recovered?

Q3:When is the Islanders' first game of the season?

A fantastic and tough challenge may open Matthew Schaefer's NHL road. With the 1st overall selection taken by the New York Islanders, the young defenseman is eagerly eyeing his professional debut against two of the greatest names in hockey ever-Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin. The Islanders face the Penguins and Capitals in their opening matches, so Matthew Schaefer may find himself instantly tested by two future Hall of Famers. Yet, just sharing the ice with the greats is only a part of his story.There have been massive changes in the Islanders' defensive lineup, not least the trade that sent Noah Dobson to the Montreal Canadiens. This hole on the blue line is, and could well be in the immediate future, a factor in speeding up Matthew Schaefer's path to the NHL, despite cries for patience from some fans. Schaefer is no run-of-the-mill prospect; he is just the fifth defenseman to go first overall this century, and the first Islander to get such distinction since John Tavares in 2009.The Schaefer NHL baptism may arrive as soon as October 9, with the Islanders travelling to Pittsburgh to meet Sidney Crosby and the Penguins. Two days later, the Islanders welcome the Capitals of Alex Ovechkin to UBS Arena. These initial encounters set the stage for a headline-worthy initiation into the league, giving fans a glimpse at how the young defenseman shows up under the intense lights.While he is elite, draft-wise, Matthew Schaefer finished his 2025 season after being injured at the World Junior Championships. Since then, the Erie Otters star has turned his attention toward rehab and strength training. During Islanders training camp, Schaefer has been working out every day and going through NHL-level training routines in an attempt to fill the gaps between junior hockey and the excitement of professional hockey.The intent remains clear: to bulk up and get faster to keep pace with the league. He says he relishes that grind. He also wants to earn a spot and prove himself mentally and physically.After a mediocre 35-35-12 record and a season to forget, head coach Patrick Roy aims to make it all better. He said infusing the youth with fresh energy and long-term value, such as bringing in Schaefer, should do the trick. For Schaefer, being part of that rebuild and being able to learn through matchups against giants like Crosby and Ovechkin should fast-track his development.Also Read: Don Waddell’s new journey with the Columbus Blue Jackets after an unexpected layoff from the Carolina Hurricanes Matthew Schaefer's NHL debut combines excitement and pressure.

But Waddell felt it was the right time to move on from an organization he had been a part of since 2014.Following his departure, Don Waddell secured a new role at Columbus. On May 28, 2024, he received the appointment of general manager and president of hockey operations for the Blue Jackets. In these initial few weeks, his efforts were concentrated on rebuilding the team foundation through the NHL Draft and key trades, Columbus choosing defenseman Jackson Smith and goalie Pyotr Andreyanov in the first round, two high-value picks that greatly exceeded expectations-A part from that, the team saw the trade acquisition of Charlie Coyle and Miles Wood and Oku free agency with the re-signings of Ivan Provorov and Dante Fabbro.

India stay alive, England frustrated after draw; handshake drama at Old Trafford and more

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

The dramatic conclusion of the Manchester Test between India and England may have ended in a draw, but controversy continues to swirl around the final-day events. The focal point of the debate is England captain Ben Stokes ’ offer to end the game early, and India's decision, led by all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja , to play on.Former South African pacer Dale Steyn didn’t mince words, criticising India's move to reject the early draw.“Play only continued for some personal gain,” Steyn wrote on X (formerly Twitter), after Jadeja and other Indian batters continued to bat even after the draw was virtually sealed.The debate was ignited when current South Africa spinner Tabraiz Shamsi defended India’s choice, posting: “Why is there such a big deal being made about the Indians choosing not to accept the offer to end the game in a draw immediately? … They got their 100s, which they worked hard for. Game over.”Steyn countered strongly: “Shamo this onion has many layers... Once [a draw] was accomplished...a handshake was offered, that’s the gentlemanly thing to do right? … Now say no, we’d prefer some free milestones... although within the rules, just seems a little, well, odd.”Shamsi doubled down: “Just because the option for the draw was given it doesn’t mean the other team has to take it. If you wanna call the shots about how long I can bat ...get me out!”Steyn wrapped it up with a mix of humour and clarity: “The game was Eng going for a win, India going for a draw… That final hour isn’t reserved for personal goals.As they say, there’s no ‘I’ in team… That said, if it were you and me batting on 90 each, it would take a tank to pull us off that field! Haha.”A fan jumped in, pointing out Steyn’s past support for Wiaan Mulder, who once declared on 367* when just 33 runs away from a rare 400 in a Test against Zimbabwe.“Is this you? Mulder's 400 wouldn't have hurt SA even though Zim hadn't batted even once at that point but Indians batting 15 min extra in a drawn Test is problem,"" the fan wrote, accusing Steyn of double standards.But Steyn hit back: “Firstly, Mulder didn’t go for the personal milestone… Secondly, if he did, it would have happened while all RESULTS were still possible… unlike this case where the GAME was effectively over and play only continued for some personal gain.”The final Test of the series begins July 31, and it’s clear that the tension isn’t just between bat and ball, it’s between principles and perspectives too.",Dale Steyn criticises India's decision to reject the early draw.

A deeper look into what actually happened

FAQs

What exactly was thrown at the courtside during the Valkyrie-Dream game?

Did the game completely shut down after the heinous incident?

Who threw the object?

Earlier, on 29 July, the WNBA match between the Golden State Valkyries and the Atlanta Dream took place. The game was suddenly interrupted by a suspicious lime green object, which was later found to be a s*x toy. The object was thrown onto the courtside while the match was still in progress. Everybody’s jaw dropped. The police inspector and the security had to thoroughly investigate the entire situation.The players of both teams could not believe their eyes at what had happened until the game was stopped for further investigation. The game was paused at 75-75. This was an embarrassing moment for everyone on the court, be it the audience, players, or police officers. Nothing like this has ever happened anywhere, let alone in the WNBA. The object, which was later found to be a lime green d**do, was taken away so that the game could resume.In the fourth quarter of the game, a bright lime green object was seen being thrown into the courtside. Moments after throwing, the game was being halted, and the entire court was thoroughly scrutinized. That’s correct, the object was later found to be a lime green s*x toy.But the real question is, who could have been behind such a heinous activity?
