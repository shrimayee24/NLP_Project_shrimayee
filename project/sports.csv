WWE Survivor Series WarGames match results: The OG Bloodline wins the WarGames match



The men’s Survivor Series WarGames match was pure chaos from start to finish, with superstars utilizing an array of weapons, including tables, chairs, and CM Punk ’s infamous toolbox. Jacob Fatu once again demonstrated his incredible agility, dominating Roman Reigns’ team with his high-octane offense. The match took a surprising turn when Solo Sikoa resorted to underhanded tactics, locking the WarGames cell door to prevent Roman Reigns from entering the ring. However, Reigns climbed the cage to make his dramatic entrance as the final participant. Upon entering, Roman unleashed heavy blows on Solo and his teammates, rallying his own team and taking control of the match.Tensions boiled over when Roman and CM Punk engaged in a heated mid-match argument. Paul Heyman intervened, berating both men and urging them to focus on the battle. With all ten participants finally in the ring, the 5-on-5 WarGames clash officially began.A shocking moment unfolded when Reigns accidentally speared Punk. The mishap occurred as Punk was setting up Jacob Fatu for a GTS, only for Reigns to aim for a spear on Solo Sikoa. Sikoa dodged, causing Reigns to inadvertently collide with Punk, leaving him injured. One of the match's most breathtaking moments came when Bronson Reed laid Reigns on a table, scaled the WarGames cage, and prepared to deliver a Tsunami splash from the top. However, CM Punk shoved Reigns off the table at the last second, causing Reed to crash through it himself in a devastating spectacle.Another jaw-dropping highlight occurred when Jimmy Uso positioned Jacob Fatu on a table. Initially climbing the top turnbuckle, Jimmy changed his mind, scaling the WarGames cage instead. From the towering height, he delivered a massive frog splash onto Fatu, shattering the table beneath them.In the climactic moments, the OG Bloodline members and CM Punk encircled Solo Sikoa to seal the victory. Jimmy and Jey Uso delivered dual superkicks, Sami Zayn followed with a Helluva Kick, and CM Punk hit a GTS. Finally, Reigns landed a vicious spear on Sikoa, securing the win for his team.",The men's Survivor Series WarGames match was pure chaos from start to finish.

Dallas owner Jerry Jones is considering a change, potentially hiring Deion Sanders, supported by former NFL quarterback Brett Favre. McCarthy's contract ends after the 2024 season, leaving his future uncertain despite his past successes.

Pressure is increasing for Jerry Jones to fire Mike McCarthy and hire Deion Sanders

Coach Mike McCarthy of Cowboys, had been criticized since the commencement of 2025. When Dallas lost terribly to Tampa Bay in its opener for its wild card round elimination, he looked like being given his pink slip coming out of the offseason for having one too many chances that might just not arrive the following year.In such circumstances, owner Jerry Jones had stuck with faith with his head coach in an uncertain situation. McCarthy appeared to be a guy who was on the way out after a humiliating playoff loss in the first round last season. But, owner Jerry Jones chose to keep the faith in McCarthy, despite uncertainty about his future.Reports indicate Deion Sanders is being targeted for the head coaching job with the Dallas Cowboys. A Hall of Fame quarterback is reportedly backing the move. With a 4-7 record this season and the slimmest of hopes to end their Super Bowl drought, the Cowboys will decide whether to move on from Mike McCarthy at the end of the season. With Jerry Jones believed to be bringing a fresh face to the table, some may believe that McCarthy will receive a new contract because his team lacks stars such as Dak Prescott.Brett Favre, a former NFL quarterback, has endorsed Deion Sanders for the Cowboys, citing his impressive resume from Colorado and Jackson State, as well as his connections to the America's Team. ""If he does go in the direction of firing Mike McCarthy,"" Favre said, ""which I have no idea which way he's leaning. I think he's definitely worthy of a shot.”Favre acknowledged his personal connection with Sanders and his ability to support his character. ""I think the world of him. I know him personally. So, I know what kind of character he has."" Sanders has not shown much interest in taking over the Cowboys, stating that he has a ""kickstand down"" in Boulder.Also Read: Will Demarcus Robinson play against the Saints this Sunday after arrest on DUI suspicion? Rams coach Sean McVay clears the air Dallas signed McCarthy to a five-year deal in 2020, but the 2024 season is his last season under his current contract. Like Dak Prescott, he did not have an extension worked out with the front office. If Dallas does have a turnaround, they might look for a new head coach this coming offseason. Before joining the Cowboys, McCarthy spent 13 seasons as the Packers' head coach. This is his 18th season as a head coach in the NFL. He has a career record of 171-109-2, having won the Super Bowl with the Packers in 2010.Deion Sanders retired as a player and became a sports analyst and coach. He coached the Jackson State Tigers football team to two consecutive Celebration Bowl appearances and the first undefeated regular season in school history. In 2022, he was named head football coach at Colorado.","Mike McCarthy's contract ends after the 2024 season, leaving his future uncertain.

NEW DELHI: In the IPL 2025 mega auction, several uncapped players fetched impressive prices due to their standout performances in domestic cricket and T20 leagues. These high bids reflect the franchises' emphasis on tapping into domestic talent capable of delivering impactful performances.Here are some of the most expensive uncapped players :The fast bowler was the top pick among uncapped players, sold for Rs 6 crore. He previously played for MI, KKR, and DC, showcasing his potential with consistent performances. Dar, who bowled some searing yorkers for Delhi Capitals last season, became the most expensive uncapped buy as RCB splurged Rs 6 crore to acquire him.This all-rounder went for Rs 5.25 crore to the Mumbai Indians via their Right to Match (RTM) card. His big-hitting ability and off-break bowling made him highly sought after. Dhir had ignited a fierce bidding war at the IPL 2025 auction, with franchises like MI, RCB, DC, RR, and PBKS competing intensely.The Punjab Kings secured the batter for Rs 4.2 crore. Wadhera has shown promise in previous IPL seasons with Mumbai Indians . Wadhera triggered a fierce bidding war, with CSK, LSG, PBKS, and DC all vying for him. PBKS secured him for Rs 4.20 crore after a thrilling auction, with MI opting not to use their Right to Match.Known for his explosive batting, Samad was purchased for Rs 4.2 crore by the Lucknow Super Giants. Samad sparked a bidding war between RCB and LSG, with PBKS later joining the fray. LSG ultimately secured him for Rs 4.20 crore, after PBKS pulled out and SRH did not use their Right to Match.Ashutosh Sharma, who impressed for PBKS last season, sparked a fierce bidding war between RCB and RR, but DC triumphed, securing him for Rs 3.80 crore.Abhinav Manohar, whose all-round capabilities ignited a fierce bidding war. Starting at Rs 30 lakh, RCB and CSK led the initial bidding, with RCB pushing the price to Rs 90 lakh. CSK raised it further, but Gujarat Titans (GT) and SRH entered the fray as the price soared. After an intense battle, SRH emerged victorious, securing Manohar for Rs 3.20 crore.Angkrish Raghuvanshi saw an intense bidding war for his services with CSK and KKR going at it. KKR stayed strong with their intention and brought him back for Rs 3 crore.The 13-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi was engraved on the annals of IPL history when he became the youngest player ever to land an IPL contract. Vaibhav entered the 2025 IPL mega auction at a base price of Rs 30 lakh as the youngest ever to be listed in the 16-year history of the league. The southpaw was finally bought by the Royals, who outbid intense fight from Delhi Capitals to get the talented teenager with a staggering price of Rs 1.10 crore.","Several uncapped players fetched impressive prices due to standout performances in domestic cricket and T20 leagues.

NEW DELHI: The two-day Indian Premier League (IPL) auction concluded in the port city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia on November 25, with Rishabh Pant emerging as the costliest buy, breaking the record of biggest price tag with a pay-cheque of a staggering Rs 27 crore from the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).Batter Shreyas Iyer came a close second with a bid of Rs 26.75 crore, shelled out by the Punjab Kings.Rishabh Pant, who was not retained by Delhi Capitals (DC) and is currently playing the Test series in Australia, was bought by the LSG after an intense bidding war with Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Delhi -- taking his base-price of Rs 2 crore to a record rise. It will be the first time that Pant will move out of his hometown Delhi to play for another IPL side, and it required LSG to empty their pockets, breaking the record set by Australian pacer Mitchell Starc last year with his Rs 24.75 crore bid from Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). In all likelihood, Pant will lead the LSG side, especially because KL Rahul is no longer with the Lucknow team.Shreyas Iyer took home a whopping Rs 26.75 crore pay-cheque from Punjab. Released by KKR ahead of the auction, Iyer had led the franchise to their third IPL title in 2024, after missing the entire 2023 season due to a back injury. However, he was still not retained by Kolkata. The 29-year-old was originally bought by KKR for Rs 12.25 crore in 2022, taking on the role of captain following seven seasons with Delhi Capitals. Punjab, who were also looking for a marquee player to lead the side, might appoint him as their skipper for the 2025 season.Venkatesh Iyer turned out to be a surprise star at the IPL 2025 mega auction, with reigning champions KKR splashing a massive Rs 23.75 crore to bring him back into the fold. The left-handed Iyer was not retained by KKR ahead of the auction. Iyer entered the auction with a base price of Rs 2 crore, with KKR making the first move for the star performer of their title-winning run in the last edition and eventually winning the bid after an intense battle with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB).England white-ball captain Jos Buttler laughed his way to the bank as he raked in a jaw-dropping Rs 15.75 crore from 2022 champions Gujarat Titans (GT). After an intense three-way bidding war, GT secured the services of the England superstar for a whopping price. Buttler, who was not retained by Rajasthan Royals ahead of the auction, was part of the franchise for the last seven editions. Before joining Royals in 2018, Buttler had represented Mumbai Indians in 2016 and 2017 editions. Buttler also brings with him valuable experience and leadership qualities.KL Rahul was part of the marquee list at the auction and had a base price of Rs. 2 crore. He had entered the IPL auction after not being retained by LSG despite being their captain last season. Rahul has been a vital asset for multiple franchises over the years, including the Lucknow, Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings), Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Sunrisers Hyderabad. With Pant no longer with DC, Rahul is the most likely candidate to lead the Delhi team in the 2025 season.Rajasthan Royals (RR) snapped up England pacer Jofra Archer for Rs 12.50 crore. The Royals, known for their strategic picks, brought back Archer, adding a world-class bowler to their roster. Archer, who played his last IPL season in 2020, was added back to the shortlist three days before the auction. The right-arm pacer made his comeback this summer after a lengthy injury layoff, featuring in England's white-ball series against Pakistan, Australia and the West Indies, as well as the T20 World Cup.MI bagged veteran New Zealand pacer Trent Boult, known for his early strikes with the new ball, for Rs 12.50 crore. The move will reunite the Kiwi left-arm pacer, who took 16 wickets in last IPL season but was still released by Rajasthan, will reunite with India’s ace fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah at MI. The pair was instrumental in Mumbai's title-winning campaign in 2020. It was their fifth and last crown. Overall, Boult has represented as many as five teams: Sunrisers Hyderabad, Kolkata Knight Riders, Delhi Capitals, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals in the cash-rich league.Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) has successfully re-acquired the Australian right-arm pacer Josh Hazlewood for Rs 12.5 crore. Having previously contributed to RCB's impressive 2021 season, Hazlewood is set to lead their pace attack once again. His proven skills in generating bounce and movement will significantly enhance RCB's fast-bowling department.Ishan Kishan will be turning up for a new franchise in the IPL as the youngster was sold to SRH for Rs 11.25 crore, which is 26% less than Rs 15.25 crore MI paid to buy him in the 2022 auction. Mumbai started the bidding for Kishan at his pace price of Rs 2 crore but didn't go beyond Rs 3.20 crore. Delhi Capitals, looking for a wicketkeeper-batter after Rishabh Pant wasn't retained, were in an intense bidding war with Punjab Kings before SRH joined the action late and got his services.Chennai Super Kings secured Afghanistan's young talent Noor Ahmad for Rs 10 crore after a fierce bidding contest ensued between Mumbai Indians and Chennai for the left-arm Afghanistan spinner's services. Initially acquired by CSK for Rs 5 crore, Ahmad's price doubled when GT's attempt to get him with the 'Right to Match' card was thwarted by CSK's elevated bid of Rs 10 crore. Chennai's acquisition of Ravichandran Ashwin, the retention of Ravindra Jadeja from IPL 2024 and the addition of Ahmad has established a formidable spin-bowling unit that appears well-suited to their home-ground conditions.","Indian Premier League (IPL) auction concluded in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia on November 25. Rishabh Pant broke the record of biggest price tag with a pay- cheque of a staggering Rs 27 crore from the Lucknow Super Giants. Shreyas Iyer came a close second with a bid of Rs 26.75 crore, shelled out by the Punjab Kings.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115684676,imgsize-63190,width-400,resizemode-4/115684676.jpg"

Who could replace Rohit Sharma as Team India's captain in Tests?

NEW DELHI: England's star batter Joe Root achieved a remarkable milestone on Sunday, surpassing Indian legend Sachin Tendulkar 's record for the most fourth-innings runs in Test cricket.Root's unbeaten 23 during England's successful chase against New Zealand in the first Test in Christchurch pushed his fourth-innings tally to 1630 runs, eclipsing Tendulkar's record of 1625.The feat is even more impressive as Root accomplished it in just 49 fourth-innings appearances, compared to Tendulkar's 60.Former England batter Alastair Cook (1611 in 53 innings), South Africa’s Graeme Smith (1611 in 41 innings) and the West Indies’ Shivnarine Chanderpaul (1580 in 49 innings) complete the top five batters in the list.The 33-year-old reached the milestone during his 150th Test, adding another accolade to his illustrious career.

Matt Eberflus Reflects on His Dismissal as Chicago Bears Head Coach



Former Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus has broken his silence following his unexpected dismissal on Friday. The move came as a shock to many, especially given the team's recent improvement and Eberflus's public optimism just hours before the firing. Eberflus became the first head coach to ever be fired by Chicago in the middle of the season.In a Friday morning press conference, Eberflus expressed confidence in continuing his role as head coach and was focused on the upcoming Week 13 matchup against the San Francisco 49ers. Just hours later, the decision to part ways with him was made. Despite the circumstances, Eberflus took the high road, extending his appreciation to his team. Following that decision, the ex HC took the moment to thank everyone involved.""I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the players for all of their effort, dedication and resilience,"" Eberflus stated, as reported by CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. ""In every situation - practice, games and especially in the face of adversity, you stayed together and gave great effort for your team and each other.""Eberflus’ dismissal marked a historical first, as no Chicago Bears head coach had ever been fired mid-season before. The decision came after a challenging three-year tenure where he posted a record of 14-32. Despite showing promise in 2023 with an improved 7-10 record compared to 3-14 in 2022, the Bears struggled to capitalize on their momentum, often losing critical games by narrow margins.General Manager Ryan Poles also expressed gratitude for Eberflus’ contributions, stating, ""I thank Matt for his hard work, professionalism and dedication to our organization. We extend our gratitude for his commitment to the Chicago Bears and wish him and his family the best moving forward.""To stabilize the team, the Bears promoted former offensive coordinator Thomas Brown to interim head coach. Brown, who began the season as Chicago's passing game coordinator, stepped into the role after the departure of Shane Waldron earlier in the season.Also Read: Why Colts' Anthony Richardson was penalized $22,511 by NFL after the game against the Lions in Week 12 The Bears’ season has been riddled with heartbreaking losses, including a Hail Mary defeat to the Washington Commanders in Week 8 and a last-second blocked field goal against the Green Bay Packers in Week 11. These close calls highlighted both the team’s potential and the challenges that ultimately led to Eberflus’ dismissal.","Former Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus has broken his silence following his unexpected dismissal on Friday.

Rishabh Pant became the most expensive player at IPL 2025 Auction and in the history of the league after the flashy left-handed wicketkeeper-batter was acquired by Lucknow Super Giants for Rs 27 crore. Pant became LSG's obvious choice as team leader as they broke bank for his credentials.Shreyas Iyer had become the most expensive IPL player for a brief period when Punjab Kings spent Rs 26.75 crore on him. He had played his cricket for defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders last season and led them to the title.While Pant and Shreyas were expected to draw big bids after not being retained by their respective franchises, the third biggest bid of the IPL 2025 Auction came out of nowhere. KKR broke bank for one of their own in the form of Venkatesh Iyer, bringing him for Rs 23.75 crore.Another notable signing over the two-day IPL Auction was that of 13-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi. From a base price of Rs 30 lakh, the teenager went to Rajasthan Royals for Rs 1.10 crore in a deal that captured the attention of many.Out of the national team setup for over two years, Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s experience found high demand among IPL franchises, with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) securing his services for Rs 10.75 crore on Monday.The second day of the mega auction turned out to be lucrative for several Indian pacers, while some big names, including Shardul Thakur, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, Kane Williamson, and Glenn Phillips, went unsold.Set to turn 35 before the start of the next IPL season, Bhuvneshwar boasts an impressive record of 300 wickets in 287 T20 matches with an economy rate under eight.Other notable deals included Deepak Chahar, who fetched Rs 9.25 crore from Mumbai Indians despite his injury history, and Mukesh Kumar, retained by Delhi Capitals for Rs 8 crore through the RTM card. Lucknow Super Giants also invested heavily, signing Test pacer Akash Deep for Rs 8 crore.Among the all-rounders, Krunal Pandya earned Rs 5.75 crore from RCB, who were in need of an experienced spin-bowling all-rounder. Rajasthan Royals made significant bids for Tushar Deshpande (Rs 6.50 crore) and Nitish Rana (Rs 4.20 crore), while Delhi Capitals secured former RCB skipper Faf du Plessis at a bargain base price of Rs 2 crore. Gujarat Titans acquired Washington Sundar for Rs 3.20 crore in another smart move.The scarcity of quality Indian seam-bowling all-rounders worked in favor of South Africa’s Marco Jansen, who secured a Rs 7 crore deal with Punjab Kings. Also making a major gain was veteran New Zealand pacer Trent Boult who was bought by Mumbai Indians for Rs 12.5 crore -- highlighting the demand for quality fast bowlers.Meanwhile, the auction reflected the high demand for Indian talent despite the limited options, ensuring lucrative deals for even fringe players.On Sunday, the first day of the auction, most of the high-profile names raked in the moolah as the franchises virtually emptied their pockets to bag the priority players in their respective shortlist.Led by Rs 27 crore Lucknow Super Giants spent to buy star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, the sum of money splurged by the franchises came to a whopping INR 467.95 crore.Pant edged past Shreyas Iyer, who fetched Rs 26.75 crore from Punjab Kings, as teams went all out for marquee Indian stars. Venkatesh Iyer took home a whopping Rs 23.75 crore from KKR.A total of 84 players from the roster of 577 were presented on the opening day at the Abadi Al Johar Arena. Out of these 68 got sold, while four were retained through the Right-to-Match card.Among other big buys, leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal attracted Rs 18 crore from Punjab Kings, who also used the Right-to-Match card to bring back paceman Arshdeep Singh for Rs 18 crore. KL Rahul was picked up by Delhi Capitals for Rs 14 crore.Meanwhile, the BCCI has taken a significant step by announcing the schedules for the IPL for the next three seasons. This is a departure from the usual practice of releasing schedules closer to the tournament.The 2025 IPL will commence on March 14 and conclude on May 25.The IPL Auction 2025 showcased a dramatic and competitive bidding war, with several franchises securing high-profile talent to strengthen their squads for the upcoming season. The second day saw Indian pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar topping the chart with a hefty price of INR 10.75 crore, reflecting the high demand for experienced fast bowlers despite his long absence from the national team. This influx of Indian talent demonstrates how IPL franchises value local players, often resulting in hefty bids even for those not part of the national setup.Franchises made smart moves by picking up key players based on specific team needs. Deepak Chahar, for example, fetched Rs 9.25 crore despite a history of injuries, highlighting the increasing reliance on proven seamers. Meanwhile, Mumbai Indians, who often make shrewd investments, secured both Mukesh Chahar and Deepak Chahar, bolstering their pace attack for IPL 2025. Lucknow Super Giants also impressed with strategic buys like Akash Deep, further reinforcing their depth in bowling.Notably, there was also a surge in the prices of all-rounders like Krunal Pandya (Rs 5.75 crore) and Washington Sundar (Rs 3.20 crore), whose versatility adds immense value to their respective teams. This indicates that franchises are looking for players who can contribute with both bat and ball, especially in the high-pressure, multifaceted environment of the IPL.The auction was also marked by some surprising omissions. Players like Shardul Thakur, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, and Kane Williamson, who are usually regarded as top performers, went unsold, pointing to the shifting dynamics of IPL team strategies. While these players' exclusion may have shocked fans, it underlined the intense competition for spots and the changing nature of what franchises are looking for in their squads.Overall, the 2025 auction was a testament to the evolving nature of IPL strategies—teams focused on a mix of experience, youth, and flexibility. As the season nears, fans can look forward to an exciting and unpredictable tournament, with new combinations and fresh talent ready to light up the IPL stage.","Bhuvneshwar Kumar, out of India's national team for two years, fetched a hefty Rs 10.75 crore from RCB in the IPL 2025 auction.

Paul Heyman’s Betrayal Could Force an Unlikely Alliance Between Former WWE Shield Members Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/paul-heymans-betrayal-could-force-an-unlikely-alliance-between-former-wwe-shield-members-roman-reigns-and-seth-rollins/articleshow/115844194.cms,"Image via WWE

Will Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins reunite in WWE?

With WWE Survivor Series War Games almost here, everyone is busy speculating the outcome of the match between the new and the OG Bloodline. But the most interesting factor in the mix here right now is the favor that CM Punk has asked of Paul Heyman.He’s not revealed that favor to Reigns for now, but it is something that will cost him dearly. There are also rumors of Reigns being betrayed by Heyman, primarily because he’s started to wear outfits that look a lot like Solo Sikoa. Now, it’s unclear how this betrayal will come through or what will happen, but it could lead to some really interesting outcomes.At this point, it’s hard to say if the two of them will reunite but there’s always a chance that they might, considering that they’ve worked together in the past and have extremely good chemistry. With the Shield now behind them, and Roman’s allies slowly reducing bit by bit, Seth Rollins is the only one that he can turn to.Especially if one were to consider that Paul Heyman betraying Reigns was because of CM Punk’s involvement, then it’s extremely likely for the creative team to throw Rollins into the mix because the two of them are also supposed to feud soon.Whatever happens, the seeds to this feud and potential alliance will be sown at the end of Survivor Series War Games itself, with the fallout being scattered throughout the coming week. It’s also worth noting that RAW kicks off the new year with the Netflix show. So the stage is huge and the feud could be kicked off on Netflix itself, which makes it a rather interesting time for WWE to explore the tensions between Reigns and Rollins and their animosity towards CM Punk.While a Shield run is impossible at this point in time, a reunion between Rollins and Reigns is something that will blow the roof off any arena because when working together they’re absolutely electrifying performers who know how to draw a reaction from the crowd and can make their opponents look good while fighting them too. All this is speculation for now, so readers are advised to take this with a grain of salt.Also read: Roman Reigns Bloodline Feud Teases Major Storyline Shift as Wiseman Paul Heyman Owes CM Punk One Favor After WWE Survivor Series Wargames",WWE Survivor Series War Games is almost here.

Delhi's bowling card:

NEW DELHI: Delhi created a unique chapter in cricket history on Friday, becoming the first team to deploy all 11 players as bowlers in a T20 match. The remarkable feat was achieved during their Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy encounter against Manipur at the Wankhede Stadium , Mumbai.Manipur won the toss and opted to bat first, presenting Delhi skipper Ayush Badoni with an opportunity to execute this unconventional strategy.Primarily a wicketkeeper, Badoni himself bowled two overs, claiming one wicket while maintaining a tight economy. His second over was a maiden, further highlighting the effectiveness of the approach.Delhi’s 11 bowlers managed to restrict Manipur to 120/8 in their 20 overs.Digvesh (2/8) and Harsh Tyagi (2/11) were the standout performers with the ball for Delhi, while Priyansh Arya (1/2) and Aayush Singh (1/7) also were among the wickets. Despite utilizing all their resources, Delhi could not bowl out Manipur, whose batters put up a gritty fight.This achievement surpasses the previous record in T20 cricket, where no team had employed more than nine bowlers in an innings. It also mirrors a rare occurrence in Test cricket, most notably when India, under Sourav Ganguly's captaincy, used all 11 players to bowl against the West Indies in 2002.Delhi’s innovative tactic underscores the flexibility and unpredictability in the shortest format of the game, offering a fresh perspective on team dynamics and strategy.",Delhi became the first team to deploy all 11 players as bowlers in a T20 match.

""We don't want this guy full of confidence for the rest of the series,"" Border added.Border also questioned Pat Cummins ' captaincy, suggesting that the strategies employed allowed Kohli to regain his form after recent struggles against New Zealand. Hayden shared similar views, specifically pointing out flaws in Australia's field placements.""They missed a few tricks with Virat Kohli in the early part of his innings,"" Hayden told Channel 7. ""It was so easy for him to get off strike... when he got the bit between the teeth, it was too late.""Hayden also criticized the delayed use of short-pitched bowling against Yashasvi Jaiswal , who initially appeared susceptible to this tactic.""Maybe tiny things with Pat Cummins, the ability to think through these decisions,"" Hayden remarked.Hayden speculated that Australia's poor first-innings batting performance may have contributed to their less effective tactics.Both former players emphasized the need for improved planning to counter India's batting lineup in the subsequent Tests. They cautioned that a confident Kohli could be a game-changer in the five-match series.","Allan Border and Matthew Hayden expressed concerns about Australia's handling of Virat Kohli. Kohli scored an unbeaten century in the second innings, his first Test hundred in 18 months. Hayden also criticized the delayed use of short- pitched bowling against Yashasvi Jaiswal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115793966,imgsize-53202,width-400,resizemode-4/115793966.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant on Sunday made history at the IPL 2025 mega auction in Jeddah, becoming the league’s most expensive player with a record-breaking Rs 27 crore bid from Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).Pant edged past Shreyas Iyer, who fetched Rs 26.75 crore from Punjab Kings, as teams went all out for marquee Indian stars.Both Pant and Iyer entered the auction after parting ways with their previous teams. Iyer, who led Kolkata Knight Riders to the IPL title earlier this year, briefly held the record as the costliest IPL player before LSG swooped in for Pant. Delhi Capitals used their Right to Match (RTM) card for Pant at Rs 20.75 crore but opted not to match LSG's staggering bid.Former DC teammates Iyer and Pant have had to deal with adversity in the past couple of years but have shown remarkable resilience and courage to bounce back.Iyer is expected to captain Punjab Kings, while Pant is likely to lead LSG in the upcoming season. Among other big buys, leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal attracted Rs 18 crore from Punjab Kings, while former LSG skipper KL Rahul was picked up by Delhi Capitals for Rs 14 crore.Sunrisers Hyderabad secured India pacer Mohammed Shami for Rs 10 crore, while left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh earned Rs 18 crore through Punjab’s RTM card.South African speedster Kagiso Rabada went to Gujarat Titans for Rs 10.75 crore, highlighting an auction filled with record-breaking bids and tactical moves.","Rishabh Pant becomes most expensive IPL player after he goes to LSG for Rs 27 crore.

NEW DELHI: India recovered from a shaky start to demolish Australia by 295 runs in the first Test in Perth. Jasprit Bumrah , leading from the front with figures of 3-42 and 5-30, was named Player of the Match as India secured a resounding victory inside four days to take a 1-0 lead in the five-match series.Former England fast bowler Steven Finn heaped praise on Bumrah for his match-winning performance against Australia.“Jaiswal scored that brilliant 161. But the player that I loved watching and that I think is actually the best player in the world, bar none at the moment, is Jasprit Bumrah. He is just — he's a joke, honestly. You watch him bowl, and you just think, I'm glad that I don't have to strap my pads on,"" Finn said on TNT Sports during a discussion with former England captain Alastair Cook about India’s dominant display.“I was surprised that India have gone there (Australia) and hammered Australia in what normally is a very hard place to go and play cricket. Perth, I know it's not the WACA; I know it's the new stadium, but still, historically, Australia don't lose many games there. I thought India was so brave,"" Finn added.Bumrah made history by clinching his seventh five-wicket haul in SENA (South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia) countries, equaling Kapil Dev's record for most by an Indian bowler in these conditions.During the Perth Test, Bumrah delivered a stellar spell, bowling 18 overs and taking five wickets for 30 runs at an economy of 1.67. His scalps included Nathan McSweeney, Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith, Alex Carey, and Australian captain Pat Cummins.Bumrah now has 118 wickets in 27 Tests in SENA countries at an impressive average of 22.55, with a career-best of 6/33. He shares the record of seven five-wicket hauls with Kapil Dev, followed by BS Chandrashekhar and Zaheer Khan (six each), and Bishan Singh Bedi and Anil Kumble (five each).He also became the fifth Indian captain to claim a five-wicket haul in Tests, joining an elite list that includes Vinoo Mankad (one), Bishan Singh Bedi (eight), Kapil Dev (four), and Anil Kumble (two). The last Indian captain to achieve this feat was Kumble, with 5/84 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 2007.Bumrah's remarkable five-wicket hauls in venues such as Johannesburg, Melbourne, Nottingham, North Sound, Kingston, Cape Town, Bengaluru, Visakhapatnam, and now Perth, cement his reputation as a formidable all-condition bowler.",India beat Australia by 295 runs in the first Test in Perth. Jasprit Bumrah was named Player of the Match. Former England fast bowler Steven Finn heaped praise on the Indian bowler.

James Cook Shines in Snowstorm Showdown as Bills Dominate 49ers



The Buffalo Bills , known for their frigid home-field advantage, once again turned their snowy stadium into a winter wonderland, this time hosting the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday Night Football. The snowy conditions didn't deter the Bills' dynamic running back, James Cook , who showcased his exceptional skills. The Bills, led by their dominant defense and explosive offense, carried a 28-10 lead into the fourth quarter.Buffalo Bills fans witnessed a mesmerizing snow spectacle as their team hosted the San Francisco 49ers on a frigid Sunday night. The stadium, blanketed by over two feet of snow, set the stage for a thrilling game in Orchard Park. The Bills proved more adept at navigating the icy conditions, particularly running back James Cook, whose explosive performance was pivotal in Buffalo's early dominance.Cook electrified the crowd with a jaw-dropping 65-yard dash through the blizzard, extending the Bills' lead to 14-3 in the second quarter. This remarkable run, marking the team's second touchdown in as many offensive snaps, underscored Cook's value to the offense. With 11 touchdowns this season, Cook has emerged as a critical playmaker for Buffalo, cementing his reputation as a dynamic force in the NFL.The dazzling display didn’t go unnoticed. Pro Football Hall-of-Famer Charles Woodson took to X (formerly Twitter) to express his admiration, simply stating, ""James Cook,"" and pairing it with a .GIF of Sonic the Hedgehog, the video game icon known for his blazing speed. The comparison resonates deeply, particularly after Detroit Lions' Jahmyr Gibbs earned the Sonic nickname for his swift exploits. Cook's snowy showcase further solidified his status as one of the league's most electrifying runners.Also Read: Philadelphia Eagles extend winning streak, defeat Ravens 24-19 in a thrilling week 13 clash, thanks to Saquon Barkley While the Bills thrived in the challenging conditions, the 49ers struggled to find their rhythm early on. As the first half wound down, San Francisco managed to breach Buffalo territory but failed to capitalize on key opportunities. Buffalo's dominance in this snow game is a testament to their adaptability and resilience. For James Cook, it was another chapter in an already stellar season, proving that not even a blizzard can slow him down. As the Bills continue their playoff push, performances like this underline why they remain a force to be reckoned with in the NFL.","Buffalo Bills beat San Francisco 49ers 28-10 on Sunday Night Football.

"FIDE World Championship: Gukesh rejects draw bait, forces Ding to play on",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/fide-world-championship-gukesh-rejects-draw-bait-forces-ding-to-play-on/articleshow/115882841.cms,"Eight games to go, it stands at three apiece

D Gukesh doesn't believe in numerology. He believes in making good moves. But those who thought he had made a mistake by not accepting a draw on Sunday, through three-fold repetition on the 26th move and unnecessarily risked things, would have heaved a sigh of relief.Because he split a point 20 moves later. And some of these well-wishers may have well believed that the thread on his wrist could have helped him.But wait, going by Gukesh's reaction, he never lost the thread of the position. And the experts and engines failed to prove otherwise. The 18-year-old Indian challenger's 14-game World Chess Championship match against reigning champion and world No. 23 Ding Liren of China stands at 3-3. The sixth game was a 46-move battle which lasted for more than four hours. World No. 5 Gukesh will play white in the seventh game on Tuesday after Monday's rest day.Gukesh and the 32-year-old Ding are in their own world of assessment and evaluations. They are oblivious and not too bothered about how others are analysing their play and decisions.They wrote the most exciting script of the match so far but still came up with a familiar anti-climax of a drawn game. The character of the protagonists in this drama could not be more different. Ding wanted to repeat the London system because it had given him a win in the sixth game against Ian Nepomniachtchi during last year's title match. And Gukesh, who believes in making his own destiny, didn't opt for repetition despite no clear-cut chances or plan of winning the game.GM Peter Leko, former World Championship challenger to Vladimir Kramnik in an unofficial match in 10 years ago, said on the Chess24 webcast that Gukesh took an impulsive decision of continuing in a tricky position.He predicted that Gukesh's second Grzegorz Gajewsi of Poland will give him a hug after the game but will also tell him it was not clever to risk things without real possibility of gains. For the first 20 moves, Ding spent only seven minutes and Gukesh took over 50. And though the richness and nuances of the position was handled reasonably well by both players, Ding's time management and hunger to win left much to be desired. After a couple of pieces were exchanged early and the castle was done on the opposite sides, the position always had the potential to turn spicy.And it lived up to expectation with Gukesh refusing to play a passive role. In queen, double rook and pawns endgame, Ding had a more pleasant position structurally, but Gukesh's queen was more active and made deep inroads asking Ding to prove his superiority. The Indian opted for the peace treaty only after queens were exchanged and his scattered pawns became less potent.On Ding losing a chance to gain a bigger advantage against Gukesh in the previous game (the fifth on Saturday) despite having white pieces, Anand said, ""Going by his expressions after the game, Ding did not realise that he was better. He is still finding his feet and confidence."" Going by Gukesh's own reaction on Sunday, even he was trying to figure out why others were considering his position to be worse.""I was not sure if I was slightly worse though it was more likely. But I thought with some files open in front of the opponent's king, I had some counterplay. I did not see why I should go for repetition,"" he said. Gukesh emphasised that he was not worried at any point in the game and knew the line till his 16th move (Rb8) and Ding's response (Nc4) took the game to unknown territory.Asked if he is psyching Ding out, Gukesh said: ""I just like playing chess. Just assessed that the position was playable. Didn't see too much danger to me. I thought tomorrow there is a rest day, so why not play a longer game?""",Gukesh and Ding are in their own world of assessment and evaluations. The 18-year-old Indian challenger's 14-game World Chess Championship match against reigning champion and world No. 23 Ding Liren of China stands at 3-3.

“He’s gotta grow up”: Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin had a blunt response for George Pickens after his bad penalties vs the Bengals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/hes-gotta-grow-up-steelers-head-coach-mike-tomlin-had-a-blunt-response-for-george-pickens-after-his-bad-penalties-vs-the-bengals/articleshow/115882119.cms,"Image via USA Today

Mike Tomlin expects more from George Pickens

The Pittsburgh Steelers edged past the Cincinnati Bengals 44-38 but would have gone ahead had it not been for two unsportsmanlike conduct calls against wide receiver George Pickens. The young wide receiver lost his ball on a defender, and pointed a finger gun at the crowd after being deep pass recipient of quarterback Russell Wilson.The Steelers won, but Pickens' fiery personality has previously cost him or his team, as he got into a heated altercation with Cleveland Browns cornerback Greg Newsome. Asked about Sunday's antics in a post-game presser, head coach Mike Tomlin had a blunt response for the star player.George Pickens, one of the most chaotic NFL player, caused two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties for the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday. A field goal attempt was blocked. The second penalty pushed the Steelers back from the Steelers 13 yard line back to the Steelers 28 yard line. Pickens was penalized for throwing the 'finger guns' first down celebration, considered violent by the NFL, meaning the referees nullified his gesture. Hopefully, no target will be assigned on him lately.Head coach Mike Tomlin publicly criticized Pickens on Sunday, despite his multiple defenses. “He’s just got to grow up, man. It’s an emotional game. These divisional games are big. He’s got a target on his back because he’s George. He understands that’s, but he’s gotta grow up,” Tomlin said.Broderick Jones, a college teammate of Pickens, approached him after his second flag for taunting a Bengals defender. After the second unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, the Steelers calmed Pickens down. Jones saw it as a personal mission.He added, “I just tell him because he’s such an emotional guy,” Jones said. “You just got to let him know, next play. You did that; it’s over with. Next play. Go make another play. Just be smart. Don’t do dumb shit. You just got to stay on him. He’s a great player. I just look at him. I try to get him right. Just as me, because I feel like we’re brothers. We’ve been together for so long. I feel like I know what makes him click and you know what doesn’t. I just try to always talk to him, stay in his area. We just continue to go from there.”Also Read: “I didn't know”: Dan Campbell expressed concern over Jahmyr Gibbs's photo, which appeared to reveal team plays inadvertently Pickens is a competitive guy, and he had a good game on Sunday with a beautiful play after the catch that resulted in a receiving touchdown.

"Blaire Fleming: Meet San Jose State volleyball star Blaire Fleming, who ignited controversy over transgender athlete participation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/meet-san-jose-state-volleyball-star-blaire-fleming-who-ignited-controversy-over-transgender-athlete-participation/articleshow/115847856.cms,"Meet San Jose State volleyball star Blaire Fleming, who ignited controversy over transgender athlete participation (Picture credit: SJSU Spartans)

Who is Blaire Fleming?

Born in 2002 at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, and raised in Aldie, Virginia, Fleming made waves in high school volleyball. Playing for John Champe High School, Fleming, standing at 6-foot-1, towered over the average women’s college volleyball recruit height of 5-foot-9.



In 2019, Fleming’s senior year, the athlete broke the school record with 266 kills in a season, leading the team to a 19-win season and being named MVP. A highlight reel on Hudl showcased Fleming’s leaping and spiking abilities, with opponents often unable to react to the powerful spikes.



Fleming began college at Coastal Carolina University during the COVID-affected 2020 season, where the player immediately made an impact, averaging 1.86 kills per set.



However, after a stellar first year, Fleming entered the transfer portal, leaving Coastal Carolina and eventually joining San Jose State.



The transfer drew attention due to South Carolina’s “Save Women’s Sports Act,” barring transgender athletes from competing in women’s sports. California, by contrast, has long allowed transgender athletes to play on teams matching their gender identity.



Former head coach Trent Kersten recruited Fleming to San Jose State on a full scholarship, as detailed in a lawsuit filed against the Mountain West Conference. Allegations surfaced that the recruitment decision wasn’t openly communicated to all team members.



The controversy around Fleming deepened as former and current teammates filed lawsuits alleging discrimination and unsafe playing conditions. Former players Alyssa Sugai and Elle Patterson claim they lost opportunities and scholarships due to Fleming’s physical dominance.



Sugai reportedly faced depression after struggling to secure playing time, while Patterson alleges the team reneged on a scholarship offer for financial reasons.



Current co-captain Brooke Slusser, another plaintiff, claims she was not informed of Fleming’s transgender identity when they were assigned to share living quarters. Slusser alleges this breach of trust, alongside an alleged plot by Fleming to have her spiked in the face during a match, has made her feel “unsafe” within the programme.



The Mountain West conducted an investigation into the allegations but found insufficient evidence to support the claims. However, Slusser’s attorney has questioned the validity of this investigation.



Despite the ongoing legal and personal challenges, Fleming and Slusser continue to be one of the most effective duos in the Mountain West Conference. Fleming is second in kills per set, and the Spartans hold the third-best hitting percentage in the league. Slusser has assisted in setting up Fleming’s spikes, despite filing lawsuits against the NCAA and the Mountain West.



Blaire Fleming , a San Jose State volleyball player and leader in kills for the team, has become a central figure in the ongoing national debate over transgender athletes in women's sports.Fleming's remarkable spiking ability has driven the Spartans to the Mountain West tournament final, but it has also drawn criticism from opponents, including President-elect Donald Trump.The controversy intensified after Boise State forfeited a semifinal match, citing issues surrounding Fleming's inclusion. While Fleming’s athletic prowess has been undeniable, critics argue that competing against women provides an unfair advantage due to height and strength disparities.Fleming, who stands 6'1"", has shattered records since high school, including setting a single-game kill record during senior year at John Champe High School in Virginia.Fleming’s spiking ability has propelled San Jose State back to the conference final for the second time since 2022, Fleming’s first season with the team.As per Fox News, even without such forfeitures, Fleming's physical talent has helped San Jose State secure seven conference wins this season.",Blaire Fleming is a 6-foot-1 volleyball player for the San Jose State Spartans. She has become a central figure in the national debate over transgender athletes in women's sports. Former and current teammates have filed lawsuits alleging discrimination and unsafe playing conditions.

Martina Navratilova: 'Can't make this c**p up': Martina Navratilova slams NY Times over transgender athlete coverage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cant-make-this-cp-up-martina-navratilova-slams-ny-times-over-transgender-athlete-coverage/articleshow/115835831.cms,"Tennis legend Martina Navratilova has criticised ' The New York Times ' for its terminology in a report on transgender athletes in women’s sports. The article, addressing college volleyball forfeits involving transgender player Blaire Fleming , referred to biological females as “non-transgender women” while discussing testosterone levels.Navratilova took to social media platform X, expressing anger, ‘NYT- you stink. We are women, not NOT TRANSGENDER WOMEN. Just WOMEN will do in the future.’ In a follow-up post, she added, “According to @nytimes, women are a subset of males who identify as trans… Can’t make this crap up.”The New York Times published an article after several Mountain West Conference college volleyball teams forfeited matches against San Jose State University , which includes transgender player Blaire Fleming. While teams haven’t officially named Fleming as the reason, many speculate safety concerns related to competing against a transgender athlete are behind the decisions.Another team, Boise State forfeited its championship semifinal against San Jose State, saying its players 'should not have to forgo this opportunity while waiting for a more thoughtful and better system that serves all athletes.' San Jose State will play the winner of the other semifinal between Colorado State and San Diego State.Fleming has been involved in other recent arguments, including lawsuits and accusations of conspiring with a rival to injure a teammate. Six of San Jose State's regular season games became no contests due to forfeits, yet the team has advanced to the conference championship game. Fleming received a postseason award from the Mountain West Conference. Teammates sued the coach, university, and conference, seeking Fleming’s ineligibility for the tournament. San Jose State's coach, Melissa Batie-Smoose, alleges the school tried to 'silence' her after she was suspended following complaints about Fleming.The National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) also faces a class-action lawsuit from female athletes alleging violation of sex-based discrimination laws. A judge rejected a request to bar Fleming from the conference and potential NCAA tournament games.Navratilova also commented on the case of Algerian boxer Imane Khelif , who won Olympic gold after facing accusations of being biologically male. A leaked medical report published in German tabloid Bild claimed Khelif is ‘a biological male ’ with male characteristics. The report’s legitimacy is unconfirmed.Navratilova criticised the gold medalist, saying, ""And here we are… Imane might have been raised as a woman, but Imane is a biological male and should not have been allowed to box at the Olympics.""Khelif reportedly filed a cyberbullying complaint in France, naming critics including JK Rowling and Elon Musk. Navratilova responded to this on X, asking, ""[Is] Imane still suing JK Rowling? Good luck with that lawsuit.""","The New York Times published an article after several Mountain West Conference college volleyball teams forfeited matches against San Jose State University, which includes transgender player Blaire Fleming.
