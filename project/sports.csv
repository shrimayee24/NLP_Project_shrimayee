What Happened Suddenly Between Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes That Led to Such a Confession

Brotherhood is pretty common in sports like the NFL, as many say the team thrives in such a situation. Kansas City Chiefs, which has become one of the strongest teams and has remained undefeated mostly throughout the season is a living proof of this theory. Out of all the players in the team, there are two such players who have stayed with each other at the highest of highs and lowest of lows - Kansas City Chiefs tight end, Travis Kelce and the quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Recently, both of them also had to deal with an unsettling incident that involved robbery and burglary of both their houses, just days apart from each other. No matter what the situation has been, these two have always remained thick with each other and now even the love of their lives are also close to each other. Kelce’s girlfriend Taylor Swift has been spotted hanging out with Mahomes’ wife Brittany quite a lot of times.Apart from being a star on the field, Kelce also hosts a podcast called “New Heights” with his older brother and the former NFL Star of the Philadelphia Eagles, Jason Kelce. Their podcast is all about brotherhood, sharing stories around the NFL and their personal lives.Recently, on an episode of the “New Heights”, Travis Kelce admitted something personal that many were not prepared for - him not being able to connect with Patrick Mahomes anymore. This caught many by surprise as Kelce went on to admit that he is just not “on the same page” with Mahomes. Travis said, “Right now, for whatever reason, I can’t find my way in the end zone. I’m just not on the same page as Pat. It’s f—–g frustrating, that’s for damn sure.”Also Read: NFL playoff is set—but with the underdogs closing in, the NFL playoffs could look totally different by January Such a candid admission has raised many questions in the minds of fans since Kansas City Chiefs is one such team that has always thrived on teamwork and the bond players share with one other. So what would be the result if the two star players are not being able to connect with each other.With the playoffs near, this has worried people and rightly so. While the reason behind such an honest admission by Kelce is not really known, Mahomes has not come out in public to speak about it. At the end of the day, the Kansas City Chiefs is a really strong team so one should not judge their capability even if the brotherhood is affected at the moment.",Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has admitted to not being able to connect with quarterback Patrick Mahomes anymore.

WWE superstars and members of The New Day, Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods made their way to the ring on this week’s episode of WWE Raw . They came out to celebrate 10 years of The New Day when they were interrupted by Big E, who made his return to the ring. Big E suggested that he should take over as The New Day’s manager until he is cleared to return to action.Unfortunately, in a heartbreaking betrayal, both Xavier Woods and Kofi Kingston shot Big E’s idea down and turned heel. Kingston has now spoken up about his actions on this week’s RAW. The former WWE Champion took to X and posted a two-word message that read, “So what?”Both Kingston and Woods have been having a difficult run these past few months. However, now that they’ve turned heel, nothing is stopping them from using underhanded tactics to put a few wins on the board. Kingston and Woods have had their eyes on the World Tag Team titles for a while now.The Championship belt is currently held by Judgement Day members, Finn Balor and JD McDonagh.

Furthermore, it would also be normal to see the New Day try their hands at a singles run.Kingston has already had a successful singles run, but now it could be time for Xavier Woods to finally get a few notches on his belt. It is a bit surprising that despite being in WWE for over a decade, Woods has yet to win a singles title.

Shedeur Sanders Brings Both Parents Together on Senior Day



""Home Game Finale” A Special Day with the Fam at Colorado

With that, here is the best-sounding version ever: A family thing in which Colorado Buffaloes quarterback Shedeur Sanders orchestrated a grand event on Senior Day. The kid really wanted to share the spotlight with his parents because he's always been raised by his father, the great Deion Sanders . The planning showed behind-the-scenes to the public via a video uploaded on the official Shilo Sanders YouTube channel. With Shedeur wanting to bring in her mom Pilar to the celebration even when things are mixed up at home, it's fair to say he somehow managed to convince her to come onto the field.Shedeur Sanders, the star quarterback for Colorado, made senior day a signature time with both his parents being present. He wanted his mother, Pilar Sanders, to witness the event and so he walked into the stands to convince her to come despite the fact his father - head coach Deion Sanders - was also there. This touching gesture was highlighted in a video shared on Shilo Sanders' YouTube channel, where Shilo humorously remarked, “My brother [Shedeur] just got my mom from the stands cause of the senior day, and we didn’t know we had to walk. They’re not gonna. That’s like World War III trying to get them to walk together.”Deion's sons, Shedeur and Shilo, were walking with their father on the field at that time when he met Pilar on the other side. In one tender moment, he touched both their backs and stepped aside as Pilar drew her sons to herself at midfield. They staged their own celebration after taking pictures as the day ended with triumph when Colorado thrashed Oklahoma State 52-0 in the last home game.The Sanders family story is all about progress and hardship. Deion wed Pilar in 1999 when he was still at the top of his game, setting the stage for the couple to have three children: Shilo, Shedeur, and Shelomi. The relationship fell on hard times and led to a very public divorce in 2013. Custody disputes and legal battles ensued in which Deion initially had custody of the children. Later, in 2017, Pilar got legal custody of Shedeur and Shelomi, although Deion remained a significant parent in his children's lives, especially now as Shedeur's head coach at Jackson State and currently Colorado.Divorce brought with it allegations and legal tussles. While Pilar has challenged the validity of their prenuptial agreement and sought greater financial support, Deion has staged an assault with defamation litigation, claiming reputational damage following judgment in court in favor of Deion for lack of any proof justifying her claims.Also Read: Washington Commanders hire Mark Clouse as team president, signaling a new era of leadership In the midst of all the personal struggles, Deion Sanders found solace in his faith, and after that entire ordeal, he was open about being a Christian after the very first time he got divorced. Recently, in an episode of Bear Grylls' Running Wild, he spoke about how devotion to Christ indeed shaped his life and also caught the highlights of his relationships. This spiritual grounding appears to have played a role in fostering resilience and unity within his family, as seen during Shedeur’s heartfelt senior day celebration—a moment that transcended past conflicts and showcased the enduring bond between parents and children.","Shedeur Sanders, the star quarterback for Colorado, made senior day a signature time with both his parents being present.

Virat Kohli back among the runs with a solid hundred vs Australia in Perth

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli 's incredible fitness and consistency continue to be the cornerstone of his cricketing success. He recently ended his long century drought by scoring his 30th Test century in India's commanding 295-run victory over Australia in the first match of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Perth.While fans marvel at the 36-year-old's ability to maintain peak performance, his wife, actor Anushka Sharma , has shed light on the secret behind his remarkable fitness.In a video that has gone viral on social media ahead of the Pink Ball Test in Adelaide, Anushka spoke about Kohli's unwavering commitment to his health and lifestyle. ""Let me be very honest about it, Virat is incredibly disciplined about his health and fitness. I think this is also happening in our industry now,"" she said, emphasizing his role as a trailblazer in healthy living.Anushka revealed the daily habits that have helped Kohli sustain his level of excellence over the years. ""Every morning without fail, he is up early doing cardio or HIIT, and practicing cricket with me. His diet is clean - no junk food or sugary drinks. Can you believe he hasn't eaten butter chicken in almost 10 years?""She also stressed how essential rest is in Kohli's routine. ""Sleep is non-negotiable for him. He ensures he gets enough rest. It's the key to staying sharp and performing at his best. He always says - that is something you have control over.""Anushka concluded by highlighting what sets Kohli apart.

Rishabh Pant created history at the IPL 2025 Auction, becoming the most expensive player in the league's history. The dynamic left-handed wicketkeeper-batter was snapped up by Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) for a record-breaking Rs 27 crore. Pant's credentials as a proven match-winner and natural leader made him LSG's obvious choice to spearhead their campaign.For a brief moment, Shreyas Iyer held the title of the most expensive IPL player after Punjab Kings secured his services for Rs 26.75 crore. Iyer, who led Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to the championship last season, was a hot commodity at the auction following his release by KKR.While Pant and Iyer were expected to fetch eye-watering bids, the third-highest bid of the IPL 2025 Auction was a surprise. KKR made headlines by bringing back Venkatesh Iyer for Rs 23.75 crore, highlighting their commitment to retaining their core players.Another standout moment of the two-day auction was the signing of 13-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi. Starting with a base price of Rs 30 lakh, the teenager became a sensation when Rajasthan Royals secured him for Rs 1.10 crore, making him one of the youngest players to ever feature in the IPL.Out of the national team setup for over two years, Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s experience found high demand among IPL franchises, with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) securing his services for Rs 10.75 crore on Monday.The second day of the mega auction turned out to be lucrative for several Indian pacers, while some big names, including Shardul Thakur, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, Kane Williamson, and Glenn Phillips, went unsold.Set to turn 35 before the start of the next IPL season, Bhuvneshwar boasts an impressive record of 300 wickets in 287 T20 matches with an economy rate under eight.Other notable deals included Deepak Chahar, who fetched Rs 9.25 crore from Mumbai Indians despite his injury history, and Mukesh Kumar, retained by Delhi Capitals for Rs 8 crore through the RTM card. Lucknow Super Giants also invested heavily, signing Test pacer Akash Deep for Rs 8 crore.Among the all-rounders, Krunal Pandya earned Rs 5.75 crore from RCB, who were in need of an experienced spin-bowling all-rounder. Rajasthan Royals made significant bids for Tushar Deshpande (Rs 6.50 crore) and Nitish Rana (Rs 4.20 crore), while Delhi Capitals secured former RCB skipper Faf du Plessis at a bargain base price of Rs 2 crore. Gujarat Titans acquired Washington Sundar for Rs 3.20 crore in another smart move.The scarcity of quality Indian seam-bowling all-rounders worked in favor of South Africa’s Marco Jansen, who secured a Rs 7 crore deal with Punjab Kings. Also making a major gain was veteran New Zealand pacer Trent Boult who was bought by Mumbai Indians for Rs 12.5 crore -- highlighting the demand for quality fast bowlers.Meanwhile, the auction reflected the high demand for Indian talent despite the limited options, ensuring lucrative deals for even fringe players.On Sunday, the first day of the auction, most of the high-profile names raked in the moolah as the franchises virtually emptied their pockets to bag the priority players in their respective shortlist.Led by Rs 27 crore Lucknow Super Giants spent to buy star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, the sum of money splurged by the franchises came to a whopping INR 467.95 crore.Pant edged past Shreyas Iyer, who fetched Rs 26.75 crore from Punjab Kings, as teams went all out for marquee Indian stars. Venkatesh Iyer took home a whopping Rs 23.75 crore from KKR.A total of 84 players from the roster of 577 were presented on the opening day at the Abadi Al Johar Arena. Out of these 68 got sold, while four were retained through the Right-to-Match card.Among other big buys, leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal attracted Rs 18 crore from Punjab Kings, who also used the Right-to-Match card to bring back paceman Arshdeep Singh for Rs 18 crore. KL Rahul was picked up by Delhi Capitals for Rs 14 crore.Meanwhile, the BCCI has taken a significant step by announcing the schedules for the IPL for the next three seasons. This is a departure from the usual practice of releasing schedules closer to the tournament.The 2025 IPL will commence on March 14 and conclude on May 25.The IPL Auction 2025 showcased a dramatic and competitive bidding war, with several franchises securing high-profile talent to strengthen their squads for the upcoming season. The second day saw Indian pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar topping the chart with a hefty price of INR 10.75 crore, reflecting the high demand for experienced fast bowlers despite his long absence from the national team. This influx of Indian talent demonstrates how IPL franchises value local players, often resulting in hefty bids even for those not part of the national setup.Franchises made smart moves by picking up key players based on specific team needs. Deepak Chahar, for example, fetched Rs 9.25 crore despite a history of injuries, highlighting the increasing reliance on proven seamers. Meanwhile, Mumbai Indians, who often make shrewd investments, secured both Mukesh Chahar and Deepak Chahar, bolstering their pace attack for IPL 2025. Lucknow Super Giants also impressed with strategic buys like Akash Deep, further reinforcing their depth in bowling.Notably, there was also a surge in the prices of all-rounders like Krunal Pandya (Rs 5.75 crore) and Washington Sundar (Rs 3.20 crore), whose versatility adds immense value to their respective teams. This indicates that franchises are looking for players who can contribute with both bat and ball, especially in the high-pressure, multifaceted environment of the IPL.The auction was also marked by some surprising omissions. Players like Shardul Thakur, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, and Kane Williamson, who are usually regarded as top performers, went unsold, pointing to the shifting dynamics of IPL team strategies. While these players' exclusion may have shocked fans, it underlined the intense competition for spots and the changing nature of what franchises are looking for in their squads.Overall, the 2025 auction was a testament to the evolving nature of IPL strategies—teams focused on a mix of experience, youth, and flexibility. As the season nears, fans can look forward to an exciting and unpredictable tournament, with new combinations and fresh talent ready to light up the IPL stage.","Bhuvneshwar Kumar, out of India's national team for two years, fetched a hefty Rs 10.75 crore from RCB in the IPL 2025 auction. Deepak Chahar and Mukesh Kumar also secured lucrative deals. Rishabh Pant became the most expensive player on Day 1, going to LSG for Rs 27 crore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115654073,imgsize-87934,width-400,resizemode-4/115654073.jpg"
Will Rohit Sharma open or not?

Loud taunts, players heckled during Team India nets in Adelaide

KL Rahul Press Conference ahead of 2nd Test

WATCH:

The ideal batting positions for Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill

NEW DELHI: A buoyant Indian cricket team is set to face Australia in the second match of the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy at the Adelaide Oval , starting Friday. Leading 1-0 in the five-match series after a dominant 295-run victory in Perth, India are looking to extend their lead in the Pink Ball Test .India's squad received a significant boost with the arrival of skipper Rohit Sharma , who missed the first Test due to the birth of his second child. In Rohit's absence, KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal opened the innings in Perth, putting together a record 201-run partnership in the second innings, a key factor in India's triumph.With Rohit's return, the Indian think tank now faces a dilemma over the batting order.During a discussion on Star Sports, former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar shared his thoughts on the potential XI and where Rohit Sharma should bat.""He [Rohit Sharma] opens the batting. Short square boundaries will suit his kind of batting,"" Gavaskar stated. ""Rahul drops down to No.6, in place of Jurel. And at No.3, Shubman Gill comes in place of Devdutt Padikkal. That would be my XI.""Gavaskar also weighed in on the bowling combination, suggesting changes based on the pitch conditions in Adelaide. ""I would maybe look at Washington Sundar 's place. Nitish Reddy will have to stay because it's a pink-ball Test; he will be your fourth seamer, fourth bowler. Whether you want to bring in Ashwin or Jadeja, that's the call they have to take once they go and see what the pitch has on offer.""When asked about concerns over Rohit Sharma's form, Gavaskar dismissed any apprehensions. ""No, not at all. Somebody of his class and calibre - it doesn't matter at all. The first time he comes in, he can get a hundred just like that. No worries.""With Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill potentially making a return, India's playing XI in Adelaide will be closely watched as they look to solidify their lead in the series. The Pink Ball Test promises to be an exciting contest under the lights at the Adelaide Oval.",India lead Australia 1-0 in five-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.

NEW DELHI: Star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant on Sunday made history at the IPL 2025 mega auction in Jeddah, becoming the league’s most expensive player with a record-breaking Rs 27 crore bid from Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).Pant edged past Shreyas Iyer, who fetched Rs 26.75 crore from Punjab Kings, as teams went all out for marquee Indian stars.Both Pant and Iyer entered the auction after parting ways with their previous teams. Iyer, who led Kolkata Knight Riders to the IPL title earlier this year, briefly held the record as the costliest IPL player before LSG swooped in for Pant. Delhi Capitals used their Right to Match (RTM) card for Pant at Rs 20.75 crore but opted not to match LSG's staggering bid.Former DC teammates Iyer and Pant have had to deal with adversity in the past couple of years but have shown remarkable resilience and courage to bounce back.Iyer is expected to captain Punjab Kings, while Pant is likely to lead LSG in the upcoming season. Among other big buys, leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal attracted Rs 18 crore from Punjab Kings, while former LSG skipper KL Rahul was picked up by Delhi Capitals for Rs 14 crore.Sunrisers Hyderabad secured India pacer Mohammed Shami for Rs 10 crore, while left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh earned Rs 18 crore through Punjab’s RTM card.South African speedster Kagiso Rabada went to Gujarat Titans for Rs 10.75 crore, highlighting an auction filled with record-breaking bids and tactical moves.","Rishabh Pant becomes most expensive IPL player after he goes to LSG for Rs 27 crore.

MUMBAI: For the second time in months, a disturbing video emerged of former India batter Vinod Kambli . In August, cricket fans were stunned to see Kambli struggling to walk properly, when someone captured it on camera.On Tuesday, another video immediately went viral, where the 52-year-old was seen clutching his childhood friend, legendary cricketer Sachin Tendulkar 's hand, trying to continue making conversation with him when they met on stage in a rare public meeting between the two.They had congregated at Shivaji Park during a memorial ceremony for their childhood coach Ramakant Achrekar. Also gone viral is his muddled and incoherent speech in the tribute Kambli attempted for his beloved coach.Marcus Couto, childhood cricketing friend, clarified Kambli's r eaction on Tuesday. ""He wasn't drunk or something. He hasn't touched a drop of alcohol for the past one year,"" Couto told TOI on Wednesday, ""It's just that he became very emotional during his brief meeting with Sachin, who greeted him nicely on the stage. He was very enthusiastic about meeting Sachin and attending the function.""It was a poignant moment. ""I met him after many years. He got up and hugged me and called out: 'Samya!'"" said former India and Mumbai wicketkeeper Sameer Dighe, ""I couldn't see him in his present condition. I felt so bad. I had tears in my eyes.""""We've played together for 14 y ears (for Mumbai), I pray to God to give him good health,"" added Dighe.""He has severe, multiple health issues,"" Couto, a former First-Class umpire, revealed, ""There's no point in him going for rehab - Kambli has already gone to rehab 14 times! Thrice we took him to a rehab in Vasai.""After the first video emerged in August, revealing that Kambli has serious ailments, Couto and his brother Ricky visited Kambli at his Jewel Cooperative Society residence in Bandra.While many of his cricketing colleagues have long given up on Kambli due to his issues with alcohol addiction, Tuesday's viral video has moved members of India's 1983 World Cup winning team to help the left-hander. But there is a condition. Kambli's World Cup winning seniors want the man to be willing to help himself first.""Kapil (Dev, captain of the 1983 team) has told me clearly that if he wants to go to rehab, then we are willing to help him financially. However, he has to check into rehab himself first,"" former India seamer Balwinder Singh Sandhu told TOI on Wednesday.""Only if he does that, we are ready to foot the bill, irrespective of how long the treatment lasts,"" added Sandhu. The 1983 team had also come together to help former India opener and coach Anshuman Gaekwad for his cancer treatment.This 'offer to help' by the 1983 champions could well be the last one that Kambli could be receiving from the Indian cricketing circle. ""Not many are willing to help him,"" rued Sandhu, ""It is well known his troubles start and end with alcohol. Kapil has had a bad experience with him. He had helped him get a job as a cricket expert on a New Delhi news channel, but Kambli only showed up a couple of times and then just stopped. I've asked Nilesh (Kulkarni), Abey (Kuruvilla) and Paras (Mhambrey), all who have played with him, about what can be done to help him. They have all given up on him. I've known him and Sachin from the time they were just 12. Sadly, we are losing a fine cricketer.""",Vinod Kambli seen trying to make conversation with Sachin Tendulkar at a memorial ceremony for their childhood coach Ramakant Achrekar.

Loud taunts, players heckled during Team India nets in Adelaide

KL Rahul Press Conference ahead of 2nd Test

NEW DELHI: Australia's Travis Head has dismissed Indian legend Sunil Gavaskar 's remarks about Josh Hazlewood 's side strain injury, calling them “pretty funny” and suggesting they were an attempt to stir controversy after Australia's heavy defeat in the first Test against India in Perth.Hazlewood was ruled out of the second Test in Adelaide due to a side strain, but Gavaskar questioned the injury's timing in his column, hinting that the fast bowler might have been dropped for comments critical of the Australian batters during a media conference.Gavaskar labeled the development ""strange"" and ""a mystery,"" drawing parallels to controversies from Indian cricket's past.Speaking on the Willow Talk podcast, Head downplayed the comments. ""I was surprised at Sunny's comments. They were pretty funny,"" he said. ""He's in the entertainment business as a few teams around the world would say. He's in the commentary team. If that makes it more fun for him, then go for it.""Head brushed off the suggestion of any internal divide in the Australian team, adding, ""Dropping 'Hoff' (Hazlewood) and throwing a couple of daggers and shooting across the bow, but who cares? It is what it is. Everyone is paid to have an opinion.""Gavaskar had previously speculated that Hazlewood's absence might be linked to fallout from his remarks following Australia's dismal batting display in Perth, where they were bowled out for 104 in the first innings despite dismissing India for 150.After the match, Hazlewood had pointedly said, ""You probably have to ask one of the batters that question,"" when queried about the team's failure to capitalise.","Travis Head dismisses Sunil Gavaskar's comments about Josh Hazlewood's injury.

Pujara shapes India's win (Dec 2018)

The Adelaide Oval , one of cricket's most picturesque Test venues, has since 2000 been a happy hunting ground for India, the memorable Test win over Australia in the 2003-04 series standing out. While the ground is a true oval - straight boundaries are long and those on the square are short - the wicket has traditionally been Australia's best batting pitch in Tests.A look at some of India's top Test performances at the historic venue this century...In Test cricket, it has happened only a handful of times that a team has lost a Test after scoring more than 550 runs in the first innings.Powered by Ricky Ponting's magnificent 242, Australia amassed 556. Virender Sehwag (47 off 41 balls) and Aakash Chopra gave India a 66-run start. However, after Sachin Tendulkar (1) and skipper Sourav Ganguly (2) were dismissed early, India slipped to 83 for four. Two batting greats, Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman came together then, and in a rerun of their famous, epic partnership which shaped India's famous triumph at the Eden Gardens in 2001, they put on a 303-run stand.Dravid's 233 and Laxman's 148 helped India score 523. Then, wiry paceman Ajit Agarkar , India's current chief selector, took six for 41 in a deadly 16.2 over spell to bowl Australia out for 196. With Dravid (72 not out) standing tall, India successfully chased down 230 in the fourth innings to record a four-wicket win.It was the fourth and final Test of an acrimonious series, marred by Monkeygate. India went into the match 1-2 down in the series.Making a comeback, Virender Sehwag scored 63, but it was a masterly 153 by Sachin Tendulkar, the legend enjoying a second wind of his epic career, which helped India put up 526. Australia replied with 563. In danger of losing the Test after losing wickets regularly and Dravid (11) having retired hurt, India needed someone to stand in the middle. Shedding his natural attacking style, Sehwag hit 151 off 236 balls, perhaps one of his finest hundreds, which helped India earn a hard-fought draw.Coming off scores of 44 & 75 in the third Test at Perth, Virat Kohli had done enough to justify his place in the XI. Come January 2012 in Adelaide, he announced his arrival as India's main batsman for the next decade, slamming his maiden Test hundred, a gallant 116 in the first innings. India lost that Test by 298 runs and were whitewashed 4-0 but were happy they had unearthed a batsman for the ages.Kohli the captain was born at the same venue in Dec 2014. With MS Dhoni unavailable for the first Test, Kohli was pitchforked to India's Test captaincy.Responding superbly, Kohli hit centuries in both the innings - 115 & 141 -joining the likes of Vijay Hazare and Sunil Gavaskar in achieving the rare feat in Australia.Forging an exciting partnership with head coach Ravi Shastri, Kohli made India an exciting unit, one that didn't hesitate while chasing 364 in the final innings. India folded up at 315 and lost that Test by 48 runs, but Kohli had managed to make a statement about how India would play Test cricket under him. Cheteshwar Pujara had endured a lean time on India's previous tour (in the 2014-15 season). However, in Adelaide in Dec 2018, Pujara proved he was a complete batsman, stroking a fine century (123) in India's first innings.Batting first, India collapsed to 127 for six, but Pujara stood firm, taking the score to 250 with his monumental 246-ball, 376-minute effort. In the second innings, the Saurashtra man became more of an 'immovable object', wearing the Aussie bowlers down with his 204-ball 71. After laying the foundation of India's exciting 16-run victory, Pujara was justifiably named the 'Player of the Match.'",The Adelaide Oval is one of cricket's most picturesque Test venues. The wicket has traditionally been Australia's best batting pitch in Tests. India have won a number of Test matches at the historic venue. Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara have both scored hundreds at the ground.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115991465,imgsize-34082,width-400,resizemode-4/115991465.jpg"
Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford was listed as a full practice participant on Wednesday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/los-angeles-rams-quarterback-matthew-stafford-was-listed-as-a-full-practice-participant-on-wednesday/articleshow/115990258.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Matthew Stafford gets full practice on Wednesday amid a lateral ankle sprain

Matthew Stafford was practicing well on a Wednesday while carrying a lateral ankle sprain. Coach Sean McVay confirmed that Stafford was not expected to have restrictions in practice. In a way, it served to confirm the first Week 14 injury report, allowing Stafford to continue heading L.A.'s offense. Denotes more than one touchdown in five of the last six games with a 14:3 TD:INT ratio achieved on that.Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford sustained a small ankle injury, but the lateral sprain should not affect his work week since he started the practice week healthy. “[It feels] pretty good. I’ll be good to go,” Stafford said, via a transcript from the team.So far this season, Stafford has faced 28 sacks, out of which he has experienced 11 sacks and 25 hits in four games. He has registered 17 touchdowns and seven interceptions in his 12 appearances, with the Rams currently standing at 6-6 and preparing for a bi-game against the Bills. As for the present health status of the Rams, Alaric Jackson was the only lineman not practicing due to illness, along with Cooper Kupp, though wide receiver Demarcus Robinson had a limited practice. All were full participants with lineman KT Leveston, tight end Tyler Higbee, and defensive end Tyler Davis.Stafford played football at the collegiate level for the Georgia Bulldogs before being selected by the Detroit Lions first overall in the 2009 NFL draft. Presently, Stafford is ranked fifth all-time in the league for passing yards per game and fastest in history to reach 40,000 career passing yards; he also ranks among the top 12 all-time in pass attempts, pass completions, passing yards, and passing touchdowns.Stafford started off 11 years with the Lions from 2009 to 2020, and his breakout year came in 2010 when he emerged as the fourth quarterback in NFL history to throw greater than 5,000 yards in a season, while also helping Detroit reach its first contest of the playoffs since 1999. He led the Lions further into the postseason with two additional attempts in 2014 and 2016, gaining honors from the Pro Bowl during the former and breaking the NFL season record for comeback wins on the other one. It was in 2021 when Stafford parted ways with the Lions after a mutual decision, then traded to Rams where he brought a silver lining to the team by winning the Super Bowl LVI .Also Read: ""This has a lot to do with myself"": Tua Tagovailoa addresses Dolphins' performance, taking blame for their below-par 5–7 season","Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford sustained a small ankle injury, but the lateral sprain should not affect his work week since he started the practice week healthy.

(Photo by Roslan Rahman/AFP via Getty Images)

Reigning champion Ding Liren and challenger D Gukesh swapped their roles within the unfolding drama -facing deep trouble and enjoying a potentially decisive advantage -in a heart-stopping passage of play. But they were playing, evaluating and deciding within human limitations and hence did not see it as precisely as computers and AI-backed smart Alecs.As a result, their eighth game of the World Chess Championship ended in a draw after 51 moves and four and half hours of a ding-dong battle in Singapore on Wednesday. It's 4-4 now in the 14-game match with Game Nine (Gukesh white) scheduled on Thursday before Friday's rest day.On the 26th move, Gukesh, playing black, had a chance to press the advantage towards conversion with the move Nc5. The Indian challenger moved the knight to c5 but sadly, it was the wrong knight. Instead of the dfile knight, he moved the a-file knight to that square.Four moves later, it was Ding's turn to return the favour. He also needed to move his knight to e1 to cash in on the window offered by Gukesh. The Chinese did move this knight but pushed it forward to d4.The crazy turn of events continued on the 41st move too. Despite surviving the unpleasant position, Gukesh refused to go for the three-fold repetition and decided to play on. As he confessed later, he was not aware that he was closer to losing moments before this phase, else he would have taken the draw at that point.On the other hand, after falling to the trap of 22.Rb1, b5, and losing an extra pawn in the bargain, Ding was struggling to attain equality as Gukesh's 'a' and 'b' file pawns turned potent with the possible tactics of exchange sacrifice coming into play. And as he was preparing to calculate Gukesh's seemingly winning option of 26....Ndc5 over the board, the Indian played the other knight move mentioned above. Hence, even Ding was not aware that he would have been in serious trouble.Subsequently, Ding had the chance to capitalise on Gukesh's badly placed knight -pinned on c5 square. Moving that knight would have exposed his queen and rook to the opponent's bishop and rook respectively. But capitalising on that warranted a longterm plan. Human Ding failed to spot the computer-cooked retreat of his own knight (31.Ne1).Despite all that above, the game was not a comedy of errors. Far from it. There were no blunders, just minor inaccuracies that had a big impact. The overall quality of the precise play was of high level.The script largely went as per the earlier trend of the match -Gukesh surprised Ding in the opening (7...f6), this time with black pieces -the Chinese consumed a lot of time and barely equalised. Then the Indian enjoyed the advantage but could not find flawless lines. He lost his clock advantage too. For a change, he offered Ding a good chance too before sticking to his script of wanting to play in a tricky endgame. It involved queen, knight vs queen, rook with opposite coloured bishops and an extra pawn (5 vs 4) with high stakes.The fifth successive draw of the match thus travelled through a myriad of emotions.Ding jumped to English Opening (1.c4) but he fell half hour behind the clock within the first 10 moves. The pawn design and overall structure of the position soon took a crazy look.Gukesh had apparently won a blitz game against Arjun Erigaisi in this opening (without 7... f6) with black pieces in 'Warsaw' in May this year. There was no question of a draw 'pact' in Singapore though.In a crazy turn of events, Ding didn't move any of his central pawns (in 'd' and 'e' file) for the first 18 moves as he activated his bishops through the knight-file. Thus, the principle of pawns taking control of the centre of the board was not followed. When the draw was agreed, his pawn remained on the starting 'e2' square. Such instances are rare in high-level chess. When Max Euwe beat Alexander Alekhine in the 1935 World Championship match, they had played a 16-move draw in the 18th game. There, Euwe had moved his 'd' pawn after 12 moves with 'e' pawn being stationary.","Reigning champion Ding Liren and challenger D Gukesh swapped their roles within the unfolding drama -facing deep trouble and enjoying a potentially decisive advantage.

Becky Lynch teases her WWE return



The Man is back, at least, it appears to be as Becky Lynch was recently spotted at a media event at Netflix with several other WWE superstars and executives. She has been on hiatus since her last match on May 27, 2024, against Liv Morgan in a Women's World Title Steel Cage Match. The return rumor surrounding the superstar has been swirling for quite some time but her latest photo has seemingly confirmed her return and she might come back to the roaster anytime soon.Fans have been expecting Becky Lynch’s return for quite a while now. After several speculations, The Man appears to be finally set to make her return to the women’s roster. In a recent photograph, Lynch was spotted with several WWE stars including, WWE Undisputed Champion Cody Rhodes, CM Punk, Rhea Ripley, Rey Mysterio, The Miz, and her husband Seth Rollins. WWE President and a member of TKO's board of directors Nick Khan and Chief Content Officer, Triple H were also present at the event at Netflix headquarters.While nothing on her return is confirmed officially, it is fair to speculate that The Man will make her return during the 2025 Royal Rumble premium live event on the first of February, or perhaps, before that, during the highly anticipated Raw’s debut to Netflix.Liv Morgan, the current WWE Women’s World Champion who was also in the photo with Lynch previously mocked her hinting at retirement amid Lynch’s hiatus. When Lynch attended The Rock’s Moana 2 premiere in Hawaii with her family Morgan couldn’t resist taking another playful jab at her, leaving a teasing comment about retirement on Lynch’s Instagram post. “I am so glad you are enjoying retirement,” Morgan wrote in the comments. “Roux looks beautiful,” the WWE Women’s World Champ said of Lynch and Rollins’ daughter.WWE’s Raw is set to make a historic debut on streaming giant Netflix on January 6, 2025. Insiders previously reported that it would be similar to a premium live event with several A-listers joining the event as the Red Brand set to jump ship from television to streaming.Also Read: Becky Lynch reveals real reason why Vince McMahon stayed unedited in her memoir WWE has advertised Cody Rhodes for the event and John Cena is expected to start his highly anticipated retirement tour starting with the Raw’s historic landmark.

Tom Brady effectively explained why the Chiefs are still dangerous this season

Tom Brady is watching closely as Patrick Mahomes could soon be seen as the best player in NFL history . The Kansas City Chiefs are looking to win three Super Bowl titles in a row in 2024, starting a new NFL dynasty . However, recently, the Chiefs are not seen as the top favorite because of their up-and-down performance lately, with experts naming the Bills or Lions as the stronger teams, with Brady reminding everyone of this.The Chiefs have a record of 11-1 this year, leading to whispers that they might have made a deal with dark forces or are under some special ""Tayvoodoo"" charm. Fox analyst Tom Brady dismissed the idea that the Kansas City victories are just from luck or good chance.“To win the close games is always the mark of a really good team, to win when you’re not playing your best football is the mark of a very good team,” Brady told Colin Cowherd on Tuesday. “I just think the Chiefs are so dangerous because if it’s a one-score game in the fourth quarter and Patrick has the ball, he’s incredible… He’s so dangerous because then he has four downs late in the game where you gotta stop him for four downs, not three.He further added, “Patrick is going to manage the game so well, he’s going to throw to the open guy, he’s got Travis out there that is going to make the right decisions in the big moments like we’ve seen time and time again. That organization does so many things the right way, they’re going to be tough to beat in the playoffs.”Tom Brady believes the Chiefs' record for consecutive wins in one-score games demonstrates similarities with Bill Belichick's Patriots. 'That organization does so many things the right way, they’re going to be tough to beat in the playoffs. I don’t care who they play, where they play. It’s a lot like the teams I played for at the Patriots. If you were going to beat us, you had to beat us. We weren’t going to beat ourselves.”Also Read: ""I don’t like that”: Tom Brady expressed disapproval of the label ‘dirty player’ used against Azeez Al-Shaair Patrick Mahomes expressed confidence in Kansas City's performance, despite a down year for the Chiefs, with nine of their 11 wins decided by one score or less and ranking in the bottom third of the league in red zone scoring percentage. The Chiefs, led by Andy Reid, are expected to continue their success this winter as they aim to secure a three-peat victory, despite their history of big game victories.","The Kansas City Chiefs are looking to win three Super Bowl titles in a row in 2024.

He couldn't pocket the $1.5m prize money.The unassuming youngster turned pro, and claimed his second victory in July, this time cashing in on his $720,000 cheque.

Cummins assured that Marsh is fit to bowl in Adelaide.""It's pretty awesome for someone like Scotty to come straight in,"" Cummins said.India's team for the second Test, starting Friday, is yet to be announced. However, the return of captain Rohit Sharma, who was away for the birth of his second child, and opener Shubman Gill, who was injured, is expected.Sharma's return will bolster India's batting lineup, while Gill's recovery provides another opening option.Boland's inclusion strengthens Australia's pace attack, offering a potent combination alongside Mitchell Starc and Cummins.The day-night Test in Adelaide promises an exciting contest between these two cricketing giants.

'Not the Afghanistan board's fault'

Greg Barclay , who made way for Jay Shah as the International Cricket Council (ICC chairperson on December 1, believes the former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary has it in him to help the sport grow and reach the “another level”. However, he added that Shah must take all members together on this journey and not keep it ""under the yoke of India.""Barclay, who was ICC chair for four years from 2020, said the Indian cricket team and BCCI under Shah’s leadership can use their influence to grow the game globally and benefit growing nations.“I think he (Shah) has got a great opportunity to use what he’s got in his background to help India take the game to another level, but without making it sort of under the yoke of India as well,” Barclay was quoted as saying by“We’re really lucky to have India, they’re a massive contributor to the game across all the measures, but one country having that amount of power and influence does distort a whole lot of other outcomes, which is not necessarily helpful in terms of that global growth.”“There are a number of things that India could do to help unite and grow the game, including commercially helping to pool off-shore rights, using their teams to give opportunity to smaller full members and emerging countries, using their clout to open new territories and markets, collaborating closely with the ICC to help benefit members, as examples,” he said.Barclay, who stepped down from his role on December 1, in the midst of an ongoing crisis over the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy, admitted there was plenty of cricket being played that he had lost track of the calendar.In his tenure of two terms of two years each, three major franchise-based T20 leagues popped up, in the USA, the UAE and South Africa, further busying an already packed calendar. He blamed the members' self-interest for the situation.""I reckon, gee, I'm at the apex of the game and I can't tell you who's playing around the world. In fact, I didn't realise that Sri Lanka were in South Africa until I read about Marco Jansen's seven wickets this morning,"" Barclay said. ""So we've lost perspective. It's not great for the game at all. It's a mess. The calendar is incredibly congested and self-interest is such that it's almost impossible to untangle all of that, because no one's going to give up their content.""The Canadian-New Zealand sports administrator also defended the governing body's decision not to sanction Afghanistan’s Full Membership status for Afghanistan Cricket Board not fielding a women's team. Fielding a women's team is integral to getting Full Membership with the ICC.""It is not the Afghanistan board's fault. They used to have women's cricket. I think our approach has been right,"" he said. ""It would be easy to kick Afghanistan out, but their board haven't done anything wrong. They're just working under a decree and a series of laws that says this is what you have to do. I don't think it would make a jot of difference to the ruling party there to kick them out.""Maybe I'm a little naïve, but I think cricket is such a force for good there, and it brings a lot of joy to a lot of people. It is better to leave it there and hope that it can foster a bit of a change.""He did point to the double standards of the national cricket boards, such as Cricket Australia, who have cancelled multiple bilateral series with Afghanistan but have played them at ICC events.""If you really want to make a political statement, don't play them in a World Cup. Sure, it might cost you a semi-final place, but principles are principles. It's not about having half a principle.""","Greg Barclay steps down as International Cricket Council (ICC) chair on December 1.

India vs Australia, 2nd Test: Facing the Pink Ball has different set of challenges for batters

Sold-out seats, and 6 mm grass

Spin factor and other tricks, and thunderstorms too!

ADELAIDE: Damian Hough offers a sheepish smile when asked about the drop-in pitch debacle in New York during the T20 World Cup earlier this year.The Adelaide Oval curator, whose team was in charge of preparing those fresh surfaces, now has an even more important task at hand -he must ensure the second Test between India and Australia doesn't end in a heap of quick wickets and lead to similar accusations of farce.""Both the drop-in pitches are challenging, we'll leave it at that,"" he offered. ""New York was a great opportunity to get over there and learn. Anything you do in such a short time keeps you awake at night. But there's nothing bigger than India and Australia in a Test match.""The brief sample size of pink-ball Tests, played only since Nov 2015, makes it difficult for the experienced curator to offer an educated guess on the expected duration of the game. One thing, though, is clear: these games, cooked up to draw in the evening crowd to the longer format, tend to finish quicker.The general perception that pink-ball affairs are a nightmare for batters is spot on, since of the 22 pink-ball Tests played, only six have lasted the full distance of five days. Seven have ended within four days, seven within three days and two games within two days, in Ahmedabad (2021) and Port Elizabeth (2017).Maybe it's because the seam, or the ball itself, can be difficult for batters to spot, or perhaps because it jags around in the in-between twilight hours with the lights on, or even because of the early swing. Also, the jury is still out on the lacquer on the ball.It's also clear truncated pink-ball Tests are not limited to the hard and bouncy surfaces of Australia, or Adelaide in particular. In fact, Adelaide isn't particularly notorious - out of seven games, two have lasted the duration. There have also been two three-day finishes and three four-day affairs.Of the last seven pink-ball Tests played across the world, only the 2021 Adelaide game between Australia and England has been played across five days. But it was also here that Australia rolled India over for 36 in Dec 2020, with fast bowler Josh Hazlewood , who is sitting this game out, taking 5/8 in India's second innings.""Back in the day, Adelaide was known for bat-a-thons and draws,"" Hough said. ""Do you want a five-day draw out of it? Obviously not. But do you want a two-and-a-half-day game? No, you don't. Wickets falling can be exciting, but 10 wickets and 300 runs would be ideal. You've got to get that balance right. The fans come (tickets are sold out at the 53,500-seat stadium). We play our role, but the players play the game at the end of the day.""Nearly 6 mm of grass has been left on the pitch, the same as in the '36 all out' Test. A recent Shield game between South Australia and Western Australia saw the quicks call the shots. ""The preparation is the same,"" Hough said. Pacers have picked up 106 of the 134 wickets to fall in the day-night Tests here, with spinners picking up 28.In fact, spin could even come into play later on, according to Hough, because of the 30% clay content, which tends to break up. ""Also, if you don't get a new ball under lights and you have set batters out there, you could see through the night-time period,"" he said.""It's a pretty standard wicket,"" lamented Australia's star spinner Nathan Lyon . ""I didn't expect this from Damian. We're going to challenge the defence for a long period of time. I really enjoy bowling here, with the spin and the bounce. Red ball, pink ball, white ball, definitely my favourite ground. It's a great venue to bowl spin. If you're good with the bat, you'll score runs."" KL Rahul , for one, wasn't so sure about that. ""The ball seems a bit harder than the red ball. While fielding, you can feel the ball hit your hands a lot quicker and harder. Same while batting. It seems to get to you much quicker and seams around a bit more than the red ball. There'll be a lot of seam movement. Picking the ball from the hand can be tricky.""There are also thunderstorms predicted on the opening day, adding to the great unknowns of the pink-ball contest.","Adelaide Oval curator Damian Hough says drop-in pitches are 'challenging' Only six of the 22 pink-ball Tests played have lasted the full distance of five days. Seven have ended within four days, seven within three days and two games within two days.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115989664,imgsize-159040,width-400,resizemode-4/115989664.jpg"

India's eternal floater doesn't worry about his batting position anymore. Make him open or slot him in the middle,

's ready to roll. Australia is where it all began for him, all he needs now is a chance to contribute...

KL Rahul Press Conference ahead of 2nd Test

ADELAIDE: As Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal sweated it out under the blazing South Australian sun, batting as a pair in the pace nets, a composed KL Rahul took fresh guard against the sidearm throwers alongside. Minutes earlier, Rahul had been reminiscing about Australia being the place where it all began for him as a Test opener.Back on the 2014-15 tour - made famous by Virat Kohli 's twin Adelaide tons and MS Dhoni's shock retirement from the format - the then-22-year-old Rahul's Test debut in Melbourne had been a forgettable one.He was slotted in at No. 6 first up and managed three off eight balls, falling to a streaky attempt at slog sweeping Nathan Lyon and managing only a top edge. In his second dig he was pushed up to No. 3 and fell in equally horrifying fashion, another top edge to a short one from Mitchell Johnson costing him his wicket. Luckily, by the next Test in Sydney, his nerves had started to settle.Pushed up to open, Rahul came up with a composed 262-ball 110, keeping the demons at bay with discipline and verve to announce his arrival. And this has been his rollercoaster story ever since, with crests following troughs and long absences in-between some stellar performances, especially away from home in challenging conditions.Even a decade on, he remains the eternal floater in India's batting order, with even the disciplined and match-winning contribution in Perth in the first Test of this series offering no guarantee of a settled spot.""Luckily for me, I've batted in different positions. Early on, it was a bit of a challenge mentally, how to play those first 20-25 balls. Not so much technique, but what shots to play, how early I can attack, how cautious I need to be.Those were a bit tricky early on. But now that I've played in ODIs, Tests and all over the place, it's given me a little bit of an idea how I need to manage my innings. It's the start that's important, whether I'm batting at the top or middle. The first 30-40 balls. If I can manage that, everything else starts to seem like regular batting.""Ten years ago, it was my first Test series. It was a bit surreal. There was a lot going on in my head. I've learnt a lot. I'm looking forward to the next 10 years and Australia is where it all started for me,"" Rahul said.In India's remarkable Perth win a few days ago, Rahul - opening for the first time since Feb 2023 - chewed up 74 balls as India collapsed for 150 in 298 balls in their first innings. He then stayed put for 176 balls in a 201-run opening stand as Jaiswal scored 161.""I was told quite early (to open). I missed out in the New Zealand series, so I was told to be ready. I had enough time to prepare. I've batted enough at the top of the order and know what processes I need to follow,"" Rahul said.However, with captain Rohit back and No. 3 Shubman Gill having recovered from his finger injury, could Rahul be shoved down the order again? If yes, it's only to be expected, since Rohit has ruled the opening slot since 2019. If not, it may well be the start of a fresh chapter again in Australia.""This is my first pink-ball Test , so I'll try and face up to whatever comes my way,"" he said. ""I just want to go out there, bat and play for the team. I just want to be in the playing XI. Fit me in wherever.""The person holding the key is captain Rohit, who batted at No. 4 in the practice game in Canberra, keeping Jaiswal and Rahul's opening slots intact. So maybe Rahul has been told where he'll bat? The answer was equivocal. ""I've been told, but I've also been told not to share it. You'll have to wait for Day One or maybe when the captain comes here tomorrow.""","KL Rahul says Australia is where it all began for him as a Test opener. India's eternal floater doesn't worry about his batting position anymore. Make him open or slot him in the middle, he's ready to roll.

Pakistan's wrist spinner, Sufiyan Muqeem , led his team to a resounding 10-wicket victory against Zimbabwe in the second T20I at Bulawayo, securing the series win. The match took place on Tuesday.Muqeem's exceptional spell of bowling saw him claim five wickets for just three runs in his four overs. Zimbabwe's innings rapidly unravelled as they were bowled out for a mere 57 runs in 12.4 overs. They had initially started promisingly.The 25-year-old’s remarkable figures are now the best ever recorded by a Pakistan bowler in T20I cricket. He surpassed Umar Gul 's previous record of 5 wickets for 6 runs. Gul achieved this feat twice, against New Zealand and South Africa.This five-wicket haul is Muqeem's first in T20Is, placing him in an exclusive group of Pakistani bowlers alongside Umar Gul and Imad Wasim Pakistan comfortably chased down the target in just 33 balls, reaching 61 without losing any wickets. Openers Saim Ayub (36) and Omair Yousuf (22) made light work of the chase. This victory followed their 57-run win in the first T20I on Sunday.Zimbabwe's opening batsmen, Brian Bennett (21) and Tadiwanashe Marumani (16), provided a solid start, putting on 37 runs for the first wicket in four overs. They were the only Zimbabwean batsmen to reach double figures.The dismissal of both openers within five balls triggered a dramatic collapse, with Zimbabwe losing their remaining wickets for only 20 runs.

Should India continue with KL Rahul-Yashasvi Jaiswal as openers?

NEW DELHI: India captain Rohit Sharma will return to lead the side in the second Test against Australia at Adelaide Oval starting Friday after missing the first match to spend time with his family for the birth of his second child.Following a strong opening partnership between KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal in the first innings of the first Test, the return of Rohit presents a selection dilemma for the team management. Will they stick with the Rahul-Jaiswal combination for the opening slot, or will Rahul make way for Rohit to open alongside Jaiswal?Former India head coach Ravi Shastri expressed his opinion on the matter saying the decision lies with Rohit, whether he chooses to open the batting or move to the middle order.Speaking on the ICC Review, Shastri highlighted the significance of Rohit's experience, noting that it could be a game-changer for India as they aim to take a 2-0 lead against an Australian side eager to level the series.""It's a fantastic boost because there's no doubting his quality,"" Shastri said. ""He's very experienced. You need that experience in the middle order.""Rohit started his Test career in the middle order before transitioning to an opening role. In 41 innings at No. 5 or lower, he has scored 1,474 runs at an average of 43.35, including nine half-centuries and three centuries.While his best performances in the middle order have been at home, where he boasts an impressive average of 96.12, his record in Australia has been more modest. Rohit has managed 187 runs in seven innings at an average of 26.71, including a vital half-century in Melbourne during the 2018/19 series.""It""s the right mix of experience and youth in the setup, so whether he opens the batting or goes in the middle order, the choice is his,"" Shastri said.""He's experienced enough to see where he's most dangerous when it comes to Australia. Where would Australia not like to see him? That's the position he should choose. And he's the leader of the pack, so he can afford to do that.""Shastri also pointed out KL Rahul's good form, highlighting his crucial 77 in the second innings in Perth, as another reason why Rohit should consider batting lower down the order.""I think he (Rahul) should carry on (opening) because Rohit has not had much time since he's come here (Australia),"" Shastri said.""Very quickly he had to play that Prime Minister's XI game. But I would say carry on with the same setup. He [Rohit] can bat at five or six.""","India captain Rohit Sharma will lead the side in the second Test against Australia.

Ben Stokes asks for clarity on over-rate penalties: 'We would like more communication with the ICC',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ben-stokes-asks-for-clarity-on-over-rate-penalties-we-would-like-more-communication-with-the-icc/articleshow/115990225.cms,"England's Ben Stokes during the first Test against New Zealand in Christchurch.

What India need to do to qualify for World Test Championship final

England Test captain Ben Stokes voiced his concerns regarding the International Cricket Council 's communication with players about over-rate penalties. He believes the ICC should review its over-rate regulations for the World Test Championship .This follows penalties imposed on both England and New Zealand after the first Test match between the two sides. The match concluded within four days, yet both teams faced sanctions for slow over-rates.Each team lost three World Test Championship points. Players from both sides also received fines equivalent to 15% of their match fees.New Zealand's penalty dropped them from fourth to fifth place in the WTC standings. England's cumulative over-rate penalties in the current WTC cycle now total 22 points. Nineteen of those penalty points were incurred during the 2023 Ashes series.""The most frustrating thing, from both teams' points of view, is that the game finished early, there was a result. But I think the frustration actually stems back to last year in the Ashes where it was the first time I really brought it up to the match referee and the umpires,"" said Stokes. ""I guess the most frustrating thing is that it's always an issue depending on where you are in the world and the style of cricket that's played. There's never an over-rate issue in Asia because of how much spin is played.""There's so many tactical decisions that you need to make, whether that be chatting with the bowler or field changes. As a captain, I like to change things quite a lot and the field could be completely different six balls in an over. But that's not taken into consideration. And getting told to just 'hurry up' isn't going to fix it, because we're out there playing a game. The times and the rules are the same wherever you go in the world. From a player's point of view - and I'm not the only one who shares this opinion - we would like to have a lot more communication with the ICC around this,"" opined Stokes.Stokes was particularly upset by the non-response from the ICC. He clarified he hadn't signed the over-rate chargesheet since the Lord's Test during the Ashes as a form of protest until he heard from the ICC, although he and New Zealand captain Tom Latham did accept the charges levelled against them in Christchurch.""The two conversations I've had with the match referees have actually been very good and the match referees have handled it very, very well and been very understanding from a player's point of view. But it's been over a year now since I made some comments around the over rates and still to this day we're yet to hear any response back from anyone at the ICC around that,"" he said.""I've not signed an over-rate sheet since Lord's in the Ashes just until we hear some communication back from the ICC that we're still waiting for. Captains have to sign over-rate sheets and fines and stuff, but I have said 'no' until I have the conversations. But they still take the fines off you anyway,"" lamented Stokes.",England captain Ben Stokes has voiced his concerns about over-rate penalties.

KL Rahul Press Conference ahead of 2nd Test

What India need to do to qualify for World Test Championship final

Australia's premier spin bowler Nathan Lyon expressed confidence in Mitchell Marsh 's bowling fitness for the second Test against India. However, Lyon also stated his willingness to bowl extra overs if needed.Marsh's fitness has been a concern for Australia leading up to the pink-ball Test, starting Friday. He experienced discomfort after bowling nearly 20 overs in the first Test loss to India.Australia added uncapped all-rounder Beau Webster to the squad as cover. However, it appears Marsh will likely retain his place in the playing eleven.""I honestly think we'll see Mitch Marsh bowl,"" Lyon told reporters on Wednesday.Lyon isn't worried about Marsh's fitness. He praised Marsh's performance since returning to the team, particularly his dominant display during the Ashes series in England.""I'm not concerned about Bison's fitness if I'm being honest. He's been brilliant for us since he's come back in. He came back in that game in Leeds during the Ashes and has really dominated, so got full confidence in Bison. Happy to bowl his overs.""Lyon is accustomed to bowling alongside all-rounders like Mitchell Marsh and Cameron Green , or even both. He has also led the bowling attack when Australia opts for four specialist bowlers, with part-time support from the top order.Even without a dedicated all-rounder, Lyon regularly bowls extended spells, especially when he's the only spinner in a four-man attack. He understands his role within the team and is prepared to bowl more overs if required.""I'm very clear on my role within the team. Nothing really changes with me…if I can get the opportunity to bowl more overs, I'll jump at it,"" he said.Lyon had a quiet first Test but anticipates spinners playing a bigger role in the second Test at the Adelaide Oval. He boasts an impressive record at the venue, with 63 wickets at an average of 25.26 in 13 matches, including seven day-night games.Lyon considers the Adelaide Oval an excellent venue for spinners. He praised the head curator, Damien Hough, for preparing a balanced pitch that challenges both batsmen and bowlers.""I think it's a great, great venue to play spinner. And I think what Damien (head curator) does here is he produces a great wicket that got enough in it, and it's challenging for both bat and ball.""Lyon believes the Adelaide Oval pitch offers opportunities for both batsmen and bowlers to excel. He considers it one of the best cricket wickets globally and anticipates it being conducive to spin bowling.""If you are good enough with the bat, your score runs. If you good enough for the ball, you'll hopefully create a few chances along your way. This is probably the best cricket wicket in the world, if I'm being honest with you. So I'm expecting it to be pretty helpful to spin bowling as well.""Australia suffered a heavy defeat in the first Test in Perth, trailing 0-1 in the five-match series. Lyon, however, expects Australia to rebound.He acknowledged that Australia didn't perform well in Perth and that India comprehensively outplayed them. He also found the intense reactions following the loss somewhat amusing, considering it's a five-match series.""We've had a chance to reflect and we understand that we didn't play our best period in Perth and India, totally our player played us. But with all the other stuff, it's been quite humorous, in a way, looking at how much has been said and the reactions of so many different people after one loss, the beauty of a five test match test series, is we get the opportunity to turn that around.""Lyon emphasized the opportunity to reverse their fortunes in the remaining Test matches. He recognizes India's strong performance in Perth but views it as a chance for Australia to bounce back.""That's the challenge of what we face right now, obviously, coming up against a world class India side that played exceptional game of cricket in Perth, but that's been nine days ago now or so.""","Australia's premier spin bowler Nathan Lyon expressed confidence in Mitchell Marsh's bowling fitness for the second Test against India.
