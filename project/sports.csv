Evander Kane’s Vancouver Canucks move begins with promise but quickly stumbles

Evander Kane's homecoming to Vancouver goes awry just days after joining the Canucks. The return to Vancouver Canucks for Evander Kane had to be full of emotions, symbolism, and hope. After traversing almost every franchise in the NHL for a good number of years, the 33-year-old winger was now back in his hometown, the place where his hockey dreams started taking shape. But a fresh start soon took a turn for the worse after a chilling incident occurred shortly after his arrival in Vancouver. The trade made everyone talk, but quickly the talk was about the player's safety.Another championship-less season gone by means late into that season, the Oilers parted ways with 30-year-old workhorse winger Evander Kane, who was dealt to the Vancouver Canucks for the 117th pick in the 2025 NHL Draft. The pick was utilized in selecting the promising youngster David Lewandowski for Edmonton. Both parties could see value in the trade; for Kane, it meant the world on an emotional scale: it took him back to his hometown.Growing up in East Vancouver, Kane began carving his way into hockey through local leagues until he really blossomed with the Vancouver Giants in the WHL. The city shaped his playing style and also his identity.Coming back in uniform for the Canucks felt like the full-circle moment for the 33-year-old, bringing with it a rush of memories regarding his early rise and youthful dreams. Vancouver fans, on the other hand, were curious and hoping to see what the hometown boy had to offer.However, things had taken a strange turn a little while after his return. Kane was said to have been assaulted in Vancouver. The 2 Mutts Hockey Podcast stated that the assault needed medical intervention, but they never said anything about a grave injury. Sources close to the situation maintain that Kane was not instigating the matter but was wrongfully placed in the wrong spot at the wrong time. A video of the incident would soon clear up the series of actions and justify his innocence.Contrary to withdrawing from life at the hint of a cold encounter with evil, Kane took to social media to rally Canucks supporters and eager to set forth this new chapter with good vibes.

Hailee Steinfeld hints at rural dreams despite Hollywood and NFL lifestyles

Josh Allen’s farming roots align with Hailee Steinfeld’s rustic vision

Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld are settling into newlywed bliss—but the Hollywood actress has a vision for their future that goes beyond red carpets and touchdowns. Following their lavish wedding at the iconic San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara and a tropical honeymoon, Steinfeld is dreaming of a quieter, more grounded life—on a farm.W hile Josh Allen prepares for the 2025 NFL season and Hailee Steinfeld eyes her next film role, the Oscar-nominated star opens up in her lifestyle newsletter, Beau Society, about a surprising desire: living on a farm. “I’ve had this dream for the longest time of living on a farm, growing vegetables, having a little chicken coop—the whole nine,” she shared. “It might not be entirely unrealistic; I did marry a farmer.”It’s not just a whimsical idea. Steinfeld mentioned that “becoming a farmer” was at the top of her summer bucket list—even if she added, “Okay, not actually.” Still, her admiration for country living seems genuine, especially after speaking with Flamingo Estate’s Richard Christiansen, who said, “I think the farm is the best place to raise kids because it taught me my definition of success... Growing up on a farm gives you the opportunity to do that.As it turns out, Allen’s rural upbringing may make this fantasy more achievable than it seems. The Bills quarterback grew up on a 2,000-acre farm in Firebaugh, California, where he learned the value of hard work early. According to ESPN, his childhood was filled with tractor rides, cotton picking, and even mini golf and batting cages at home.Allen’s father, Joel Allen, once told The Denver Post, “If I wanted him to drive a tractor, he was there...

The halftime ceremony took place during a game against the Chicago Sky. It was a significant chapter in WNBA history. While Angel Reese powered the Sky to a 92-85 win over the Sparks, the true spotlight was on Parker as she was being immortalized by the team she led for 13 seasons.

Thousands filled the arena to celebrate her decorated career. Tributes poured in from basketball royalty. LeBron James, the NBA’s all-time scoring leader, took to Instagram to share a brief but powerful reaction to the moment, posting a video of the ceremony with the caption, “🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽”.Magic Johnson, Los Angeles Lakers icon and Sparks co-owner, offered a far more extensive tribute. Taking to X , Johnson wrote: “Candace Parker has left an indelible mark on the Los Angeles Sparks, not only as one of the greatest players to ever grace the court, but as a true ambassador of our franchise and women’s basketball as a whole.”The NBA legend continued, “Beginning with her arrival to the City of Angels in 2008, she not only lived up to the expectations placed on her as a two-time Gatorade Basketball Player of the Year and NCAA National Champion, she far exceeded them. Her unparalleled skill, relentless drive, and leadership elevated the Sparks to new heights and set a new standard of greatness. Candace is the best all-around player that has ever played in the WNBA. ”Johnson went on to add, “Her legacy is immeasurable — she redefined excellence, was a champion on the court and for the Los Angeles community and inspired countless fans and future generations of athletes. Very few champions get to see their jersey hanging from the rafters in this city. Retiring Candace’s No. 3 jersey is not just a celebration of her extraordinary career, but a tribute to the enduring mark she's left on this organization, the WNBA, and the city of Los Angeles. She will forever be a part of the Sparks family.”The tribute didn’t end there. WNBA Hall of Famer Lisa Leslie, who handed the franchise’s leadership to Parker in 2008, praised her successor with heartfelt emotion. “She changed the game.

Reflecting on her journey, she said, “It’s super important to see this jersey in the rafters before any others because my 13 years here were super special. It was ups, downs, wins, losses, heartaches and rewards, but it’s super special to share that with my teammates and coaches with an organization that bet on me with the first pick in the 2008 WNBA Draft.

Golden State Warriors lead Giannis Antetokounmpo’s chase

How the deal could happen and what it means for both teams

The NBA offseason is officially underway, and fans are already watching closely. Some teams are expected to make big moves in the coming weeks. Free agency talks are heating up, and trade rumors are surfacing across the league. One of the biggest names in the NBA is now being linked to a major franchise out West. As teams prepare for next season, this story is quickly becoming the talk of the league.According to a recent report that began circulating on June 29, the Golden State Warriors have become the leading challengers to obtain Giannis Antetokounmpo from the Milwaukee Bucks. The news was divided by X by @butlerllmuse, a reliable NBA tracking account known for posting early trade development.Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is 29 years old, has played for the Milwaukee Bucks since he was drafted in 2013. He is a two-time NBA MVP and led the Bucks to their first championship in 50 years back in 2021.The report does not confirm a final agreement, but says the Golden State Warriors are actively exploring trade options to bring Giannis to San Francisco. The Bucks, on the other hand, may be entering a new phase after falling short in the playoffs this past season.If a trade happens, it would likely include a big return to the Milwaukee Bucks. This could involve names like Andrew Wiggins, Jonathan Kuminga, and future draft picks. The Warriors’ front office, led by general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr., is reportedly looking for ways to keep Stephen Curry in championship contention. Adding a player like Giannis would change the future of the franchise.On the Bucks' side, the team may be forced to rebuild. After their 2024–25 season ended earlier than expected, and with Damian Lillard also facing uncertainty, the Bucks may decide to reshape their roster.In an earlier interview from September 2023, Giannis told the New York Times,“I want to be in a place where I can win and stay competitive. If that’s not in Milwaukee, it has to be somewhere else.”That quote is now resurfacing online as this story picks up speed.The situation is still developing, but if the Warriors do land Giannis, it could be one of the biggest trades in recent NBA history.Also Read: Who is Malik Beasley's girlfriend?

Toronto Maple Leafs era ends as Mitch Marner moves on



Mitch Marner's impending departure from the Toronto Maple Leafs, added an emotional twist to the 2025 offseason. As for many years, Marner has been a mainstay in Toronto's top lines, producing two-way play of the highest calibre. His farewell, a nostalgic media appearance. Also with past-tense references, fans and analysts believe the writing is on the wall.Mitch Marner’s expected departure is more than just a roster change. It necessitates a comprehensive reassessment of Toronto’s structure, identity, and short-term objectives. The club now has a rare opportunity to reset over $10 million in cap space and recalibrate a roster that has long underperformed in the playoffs, especially in high-pressure postseason moments where offensive depth and defensive reliability often faltered.Trade and free agent speculation will dominate the coming weeks, with potential targets like Elias Lindholm or Martin Necas being floated but nothing can truly replace the consistency and chemistry Marner brought to the Maple Leafs lineup.What truly made Marner’s farewell resonate was his candid reflection on the off-ice toll of playing in Toronto. He spoke of the strain on his family, especially his wife Stephanie, as the hockey-mad city often directed its frustrations toward him during playoff losses.The stress of being a high-profile figure in a market as intense as Toronto likely played a large part in his decision, and the opportunity to play elsewhere, possibly with the Anaheim Ducks or Seattle Kraken, two teams with strong rebuild potential and passionate yet less invasive fan bases. This could bring the balance and freedom his personal life demands.For Marner, this isn’t just a hockey decision, it’s a personal pivot aimed at preserving both performance and well-being in the next chapter of his NHL career.Mitch Marner’s career with the Maple Leafs was more than numbers. It was connection, growth, and at times, heartbreak, from a hometown hero to a polarizing figure under pressure. Marner’s evolution mirrored the highs and lows of a team struggling to meet its potential.Now, as Toronto prepares to write its next chapter. The absence of number 16 will be felt in more ways than one.Marner’s emotional exit signals more than just a player leaving, it’s the end of an era. His departure forces Toronto into a moment of reckoning, both on and off the ice. As one chapter closes, the Leafs now stand at a franchise-defining crossroads.His likely exit opens major salary cap space but leaves a leadership void on and off the ice, as Toronto begins to rethink its direction.

Sydney Sweeney and Tom Brady take over the dance floor at star-studded celebration

Hollywood has found its latest triangle of intrigue—and it all went down at one of the most high-profile weddings of the year. At Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez’s lavish wedding in Venice, Italy, stars Sydney Sweeney, Tom Brady, and Orlando Bloom stirred the celebrity rumor mill with their unexpectedly cozy interactions, igniting fresh speculation of a budding love triangle.Sydney Sweeney, already a rising icon thanks to her breakout roles in Euphoria and Anyone But You, stole the spotlight from a sea of A-list guests. According to Radar Online, she was “the most sought-after person to be around at the Bezos wedding,” with one insider claiming, “Every guy that has been in her presence has talked about how stunning she is in real life.”The energy between Sweeney and NFL legend Tom Brady quickly caught attention. Witnesses say the two shared flirty banter at the hotel bar before dancing together until 2 AM. “He was all over the place,” reported TMZ, capturing Brady’s unusually loose and lively presence.While that may have been enough to send the internet into a frenzy, things got even more curious when Orlando Bloom entered the picture. The Pirates of the Caribbean actor was also seen on the dance floor, and the very next morning, the trio were photographed strolling through the romantic streets of Venice.Sweeney, dressed in a floral midi dress with black heels, was flanked by Bloom in a casual black outfit and Brady in a Los Angeles Fire Department T-shirt—further fueling whispers of something more than friendship.The timing adds another layer of intrigue. Sweeney reportedly split from longtime fiancé Jonathan Davino earlier this year. Brady has been single since his 2022 divorce from Gisele Bündchen. Meanwhile, Bloom, who has been engaged to Katy Perry since 2019, showed up to the wedding alone—despite Perry also attending the event separately—sparking rumors of their potential breakup.Also post: Tom Brady’s alleged flirty dance with Sydney Sweeney at Bezos wedding adds more fire to their dating speculation Though no one in the trio has confirmed or denied the swirling speculation, their interactions were enough to overshadow even the billionaire couple’s grand affair.

From iconic winger to iconic leader: Lanny McDonald’s transition off the ice



A survivor, a gentleman, and a man of unmatched heart



Lanny McDonald may be best remembered for his fiery red mustache and clutch goals, but his legacy stretches far beyond his days on the ice. After 10 years serving as Chairman of the Hockey Hall of Fame’s Board, McDonald has officially retired from his leadership post—leaving behind a lasting impact that reshaped how hockey history is honored.Best known for lifting the Stanley Cup with the Calgary Flames in 1989, Lanny McDonald didn’t hang up his influence when he retired as a player. In 2015, he took over as Chairman of the Hockey Hall of Fame, and quietly but powerfully led the organization through milestones like the NHL ’s centennial, the 125th anniversary of the Stanley Cup, and even the unpredictable challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 50 new Hall of Famers were inducted under his watch.His leadership style? Thoughtful, human, and humble. From overseeing monumental events to making sure Selection Committee members had comfortable chairs, McDonald proved that even the smallest decisions could reflect deep respect for the game. As the Hall itself said in tribute:“Ten years. Countless moments. One unforgettable leader. Today, we celebrate Lanny McDonald… Lanny’s legacy goes far beyond the ice—his passion, humour, and devotion to the game have shaped the Hall and inspired hockey fans around the world.”McDonald’s off-ice legacy also includes countless acts of character and resilience. In 2024, he suffered a cardiac arrest at the Calgary airport shortly after the NHL All-Star Game. Surviving thanks to quick medical action, he went on to undergo quadruple bypass surgery—and returned to work like nothing happened.That kind of grit defined him. He was the NHL’s first-ever King Clancy Trophy winner for leadership and humanitarian work and was honored with a lifetime achievement award from the WHL. As one fan simply put it: “A truly decent person. Congrats Lanny.”Also Read: “People felt betrayed”: Wayne Gretzky’s ties with Donald Trump resurface and spark heated debate in Canada In a sport that often glorifies toughness, Lanny McDonald showed that true greatness lies in integrity.

From NFL player to on-field mentor



Simone Biles ' silent support let the spotlight stay on the kids



Families applaud Owens for personal investment, not just participation

NFL safety Jonathan Owens returned to his roots, not to be celebrated, but to give back. His free youth football camp, hosted at his alma mater, wasn’t about fame or fanfare—it was about presence, purpose, and passing on lessons he once needed. As dozens of kids ran drills, Owens ran with them. The impact wasn’t loud, but it was deeply felt.What separated this camp from countless others wasn’t the structure—it was the man leading it. Owens didn’t just oversee the stations; he coached every step, often sprinting beside young athletes, guiding form, offering pointers, and encouraging effort. Instagram stories captured him “instructing with his own hands,” reinforcing that his involvement wasn’t symbolic—it was sincere.Parents and onlookers quickly took to social media to express their gratitude. Not with vague praise, but with heartfelt thanks. Owens didn’t outsource inspiration; he delivered it personally, with a focus on humility, resilience, and accountability. This wasn’t a performance—it was mentorship in motion.In the background was someone used to the global spotlight—Simone Biles, one of the most decorated athletes in history.But this time, she intentionally stayed out of the limelight, letting her husband’s efforts take center stage. Her presence was quiet but meaningful, helping underscore that the camp wasn’t about celebrity.American RJ Michelle Mishelae Proctor reflected on the event with joy, writing: “@joowens camp today was amazingly organized and fun for the youth! Thanks for giving back to the kids! Loved seeing wifey @simonebiles showing support! Y’all are too cute.” The couple’s team spirit kept the focus where it belonged—on the children.Praise poured in from parents whose children left with more than just goodie bags—they left with belief. One parent shared, “Thanks for allowing my three boys to be a part of your camp today. They had a great time and learned valuable skills! Continued blessings for you @jowens @cbchighschool.”Another echoed the sentiment in simple but powerful words: “Thank you @jowens for giving back to the youth today…my kid enjoyed it.” This wasn’t just another youth camp—it was a carefully built experience.

Chicago’s rookie WR3 flexes confidence ahead of first NFL season, catching Williams’ attention



After years of misfires, the Bears finally have a blueprint—and believers

The Chicago Bears are entering the 2025 NFL season with renewed purpose and a retooled roster led by Caleb Williams, who’s expected to command the offense in his second year. After a chaotic rookie campaign and a disappointing 5-win record, the spotlight is now firmly on Williams’ growth under new head coach Ben Johnson. With another aggressive offseason behind them, the Bears appear ready to reintroduce themselves to the NFC North. Their biggest gamble now rests on the chemistry between Williams and his newest weapon, Luther Burden III.The Bears' second-round draft pick, Luther Burden III, has already made a splash off the field with a bold social media post. Sharing pictures ahead of camp, he captioned it, “same shi different toilet,” alongside a photo of NBA icon Allen Iverson, known for his raw swagger and authenticity. Caleb Williams didn’t hesitate to respond, simply commenting, “Lu!!”—a nod that lit up Bears fans across Instagram. The post reflects Burden’s mindset: he’s not just excited—he’s ready.Burden enters Chicago after a standout college career at Missouri, where he hauled in 192 catches for 2,263 yards and 21 touchdowns in 38 games. He adds speed, attitude, and explosiveness to a loaded receiver room featuring DJ Moore and Rome Odunze.Slotted as WR3, Burden’s personality and playmaking ability could quickly earn him a bigger role. His presence adds another dynamic option to Ben Johnson’s creative offensive scheme.Ben Johnson arrives in Chicago after engineering one of the NFL’s top offenses with the Detroit Lions. The Bears are hoping his system unlocks the full potential of Caleb Williams after a turbulent rookie season. For a franchise long plagued by coaching and quarterback instability, Johnson and Williams offer a rare sense of continuity. And with Burden in the mix, Chicago may finally be shaping a young, dangerous offensive trio.Also read: Jonathan Owens wins hearts with impactful youth camp as Simone Biles quietly supports from the sidelines The 2025 season won't be without growing pains, but the foundation feels different—and stronger.

Watt. Source: X

In December last year, Steelers star T.J. Watt suffered an ankle injury late as Pittsburgh lost to the Philadelphia Eagles. Watt sustained the injury in the fourth quarter when he was rushing around the edge against Eagles’ Lane Johnson. But Watt could very well be back in form in a few weeks time, if insiders are to be believed.On Sunday's episode of SportsCenter, analyst Jeremy Fowler claimed that the Watt can not only regain his form but also come up as the title of highest-paid defender, which is currently held by the Browns' DE Myles Garrett.T.J Watt poised to be the true comeback kid as per NFL insiders""Steelers, I’m sensing are optimistic they can reach a deal with Watt eventually,"" Fowler said. ""My sense is that he will probably be the highest-paid pass-rusher in the league when this is all said and done. He wants to be a Steeler for life, the Steelers want that, he’s a legacy-type player.""They believe at 30 years old he still has several good years left. They’re just gonna have to come up with a number and a good guarantee structure. He did miss minicamp, so Pittsburgh has a lot of work to do. But typically, Pittsburgh perks up in these things around training camp and late July,” Fowler added.Last week, another NFL insider, Jesse Palmer, said during a talk show that TJ Watt may soon become the NFL's highest-paid defender, according to reports he had been hearing.Palmer also shed some light on Watt's contract negotiations with the Steelers and how it could be a particularly famous record held by Myles Garrett.""I'm hearing there's a chance Watt gets past [$40 million],"" Palmer said. ""Which is something we're really keeping an eye on, right? If he gets that $40 million a year, at the age he is at, he has every right to ask for it. I've talked on here a lot about the comparison between him and Myles Garrett. The numbers are almost identical in every aspect. … [Watt] has the right to try and get that.""Sports writers Destin Adams and Kyle Crabbs also addressed Watt’s future in the league and broke down why he’s so valuable as a player. “Watt's one of the league's best pure pass rushers, and he had 19 sacks as recently as 2023,” Crabbs wrote.Adams shared, “If the Steelers' secondary can be better this year, I think Watt should be the odds-on favorite to lead the league in sacks as well as to win Defensive Player of the Year. The biggest hurdle still remaining is getting his new contract figured out so there are no distractions in his way come the regular season, but I'd be surprised if the two sides aren't able to come to an agreement before training camp concludes”",T.J.

A surprising player trade has just taken place in the NFL, and fans are still trying to process the big move. The Miami Dolphins and Pittsburgh Steelers swapped some of their top stars in a deal that includes not only key players but also draft picks and new contracts. One All-Pro defender is heading back to his first team, while another joins a strong defensive group. A well-known tight end is also part of this unexpected exchange. Here’s what really happened and how it may change both teams.The Miami Dolphins traded Pro Bowl tight end Jonnu Smith and three-time All-Pro cornerback Jalen Ramsey - but they also included a seventh-round pick in the 2027 NFL draft. That pick was added to the Miami Dolphins as well as Jalen Ramsey and Jonnu Smith. In return, the Miami Dolphins got Minkah Fitzpatrick, a three time Pro Bowler at safety as well as a fifth-round pick in the 2027 NFL draft as reported via ESPN's Adam Schefter.Jalen Ramsey, 29, confirmed the news himself on X with the post,He will now earn $26.6 million this season after a $1.5 million pay raise. Jonnu Smith, who led the Miami Dolphins in catches last season and made the Pro Bowl, signed a $12 million contract extension for one year.Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith has worked with Jonnu Smith in the past and was the one who pushed for the trade.Minkah Fitzpatrick, who started his NFL career with the Miami Dolphins in 2018, has opted to reunite with Miami Dolphins at some point in his career. The Miami Dolphins drafted Minkah Fitzpatrick with the 11th overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, and he was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2019. Minkah Fitzpatrick proved to be elite after he joined the Pittsburgh Steelers and should help the Miami Dolphins improve their defense again.With Jalen Ramsey joining Darius Slay Jr. and Joey Porter Jr. in the Pittsburgh Steelers’ secondary, now has one of the strongest defensive backfields in the NFL.This trade is part of a busy offseason for the Pittsburgh Steelers, who have already added Aaron Rodgers and DK Metcalf, while parting ways with George Pickens.","The Miami Dolphins traded Pro Bowl tight end Jonnu Smith and three-time All-Pro cornerback Jalen Ramsey to the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Why the New York Islanders are betting on Alexander Romanov with an eight-year, $6.25 million-per-season commitment

How Alexander Romanov transformed from a Montreal Canadiens prospect to a key New York Islanders defender

Why Alexander Romanov’s eight-year deal could redefine the New York Islanders’ future

When the New York Islanders announced on Monday that Alexander Romanov had signed an eight-year contract extension, they weren’t just making another offseason move—they were making a clear statement about their future. Romanov, 25, has become one of the team’s most reliable and physical defensemen since arriving from Montreal in 2022, leading the Islanders in blocked shots last season. As Canadiens general manager Kent Hughes once put it, trading Romanov was “very difficult,” a sign of the value he’s brought everywhere he’s played. Now the Islanders are betting big that Romanov will anchor their defense for years to come.Alexander Romanov’s new deal, reported to carry an average annual value of $6.25 million according to Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman, is designed to secure the Islanders’ blue line deep into the next decade. Last season, he logged over 22 minutes of ice time per game—the highest of his career—while finishing with a positive plus-minus rating for the third straight year. He also tallied 20 points in 64 games, scoring four goals and adding 16 assists.Since joining the Islanders in 2022, Romanov has brought a blend of grit and reliability, leading team defensemen with 147 hits and pacing the entire squad with 165 blocked shots this past season.That kind of physical presence has made him indispensable on the back end and a natural candidate for a long-term commitment from management.Alexander Romanov’s path to New York Islanders started with the Montreal Canadiens, who selected him 38th overall in the 2018 NHL Draft. After playing two seasons in the KHL, he signed a three-year, entry-level deal on July 13, 2020, and debuted with the Canadiens in the COVID-shortened 2020–21 season, appearing in 54 of 56 regular-season games.Though he saw limited playoff action, Romanov still carved out a memorable moment by becoming the youngest defenseman in Canadiens history to score in the Stanley Cup Final on July 5, 2021. A year later, on July 7, 2022, Montreal traded him along with a fourth-round pick to the Islanders in exchange for the 13th overall selection in the draft—a move that Hughes described as “very difficult” but necessary to land centerman Kirby Dach.Beyond his NHL experience, Romanov has also shone internationally. At the 2019 IIHF World Junior Championship in Canada, he anchored Russia’s defense, finishing with one goal and seven assists on the way to a bronze medal, and earning Best Defenseman honors from the IIHF Directorate.Monday’s extension reflects the Islanders’ confidence in Romanov as a central figure in their plans, especially as they reshape their roster following the recent trade of Noah Dobson to Montreal. By committing to Romanov for eight more years, New York is investing in toughness, experience, and leadership on the blue line—hoping he will be the cornerstone of their defense for seasons to come.Also Read: Why pursuing Mikael Granlund could be a high-risk gamble for the Montreal Canadiens","Alexander Romanov signed an eight-year contract extension with the New York Islanders on Monday.

Dante Fabbro's main advantages:

Excellent stick position, controlled gap

Calm and calculated under pressure to forecheck

Power play killer and shot blocker

The reason Columbus wanted to extend



Locks up a dependable top-four defenseman at a reasonable cap charge. Preserves roster consistency throughout a critical reconstruction stage. Gives a young locker room leadership and playoff experience.

Dante Fabbro's road to Columbus

In a league that values dependable blue-line depth very rarely, the Columbus Blue Jackets have taken a strategic move to fortify the defensive unit for the future. The team is leaning toward Dante Fabbro as their long-term prospect, whom they continue to consider more as a working option with some quiet efficiency and calmness of play to his name. Columbus wants to firm up its young nucleus and compete for a playoff spot, with Fabbro being the center of their current plan.Since Columbus purchased it, Fabbro has consistently established a position in the top four. He is commended for his ability to play important minutes against challenging opponents, his great defensive instincts, and his effective puck movement. In the previous season, Fabbro was afforded more than 20 minutes of ice time per game, recording 3 goals and 18 assists, 21 points in 74 games.His consistent performance assures the more aggressive Jackets' defensive players to join the rush, knowing they will be covered by a capable partner.In recent years, the Blue Jackets have struggled to assemble a reliable defensive core. The organisation may avoid losing Fabbro to free agency or a bidding battle in the upcoming summer by extending him now. Additionally, it conveys a powerful message of stability as Columbus continues to develop its roster around key players like Adam Fantilli and Zach Werenski.Columbus should sign this contract for the following reasons:Fabbro entered the NHL spotlight in the 2016 Draft when he was picked 17th overall by the Predators. Over the course of five seasons with the franchise, he slowly earned a regular spot on the blue line, showing promise with his mobility and defensive awareness. Upon being traded to Columbus, Fabbro immediately set himself up as a trusted presence on the ice. Now 26, with tremendous value, he stands at a crossroads in his career, poised to take on an instrumental role in shaping the Blue Jackets' defensive core going forward.Also Read: NHL Trade News: Maple Leafs avoid RFA drama, secure Matthew Knies with massive six-year, $46.5 million dealThe Blue Jackets and Dante Fabbro both benefit from this contract extension.

Poll Was Carlos Alcaraz's performance in his first-round match concerning? Yes, he struggled too much No, he still won

Carlos Alcaraz was forced into deep waters on Day 1 of Wimbledon 2025, battling past veteran Fabio Fognini in an epic five-setter to begin his title defence. The two-time defending champion looked far from his fluent best but still managed a 7-5, 6-7(5), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1 win after four-and-a-half hours of momentum swings on Centre Court.The 22-year-old Spaniard, fresh off his Roland-Garros triumph, committed 62 unforced errors and faced 21 break points in a match that tested his endurance and focus. “Vamos!” Alcaraz roared after breaking Fognini early in the final set — a set in which he finally regained control, sealing his 19th straight win in style.Aryna Sabalenka, meanwhile, made a confident start in the women’s draw. The top seed brushed aside Canadian qualifier Carson Branstine 6-1, 7-5. Sabalenka, who is seeking her first Wimbledon title after finishing runner-up at both the Australian and French Opens this year, credited recent practice sessions with Novak Djokovic and Jannik Sinner for helping her “understand and adjust better” to tough shots on grass. The Belarusian faces either Lulu Sun or Marie Bouzkova in the second round.In the biggest upset of the day, ninth seed Daniil Medvedev was sent packing by France’s Benjamin Bonzi in four sets.The 2023 semifinalist and former US Open champion is now out in the first round of back-to-back Slams, following a similar early exit at Roland-Garros. Despite his struggles, Medvedev brushed off concerns, saying he’s “not that worried… yet.”Elsewhere, Stefanos Tsitsipas retired hurt during his first-round match against French qualifier Valentin Royer, citing a back issue. The Greek star had won just 43% of his first serves and struggled with movement before calling time early in the second set.One of the day’s most exciting storylines came from Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca. The 18-year-old, playing his first Wimbledon main draw match, impressed with a 6-4, 6-1, 7-6(5) win over local wildcard Jacob Fearnley to become the youngest player since Alcaraz in 2021 to reach Round 2 at SW19.Day 1 delivered drama, resilience, and a reminder that at Wimbledon, nothing comes easy—even for champions.","Carlos Alcaraz beat Fabio Fognini 7-5, 6-7(5), 7- 5, 2-6,6-1.

Jasprit Bumrah: India’s Spearhead Locked In for 2nd Test?

South Africa's cricket team, fresh from their World Test Championship victory, has returned to Test cricket against Zimbabwe at Queen Sports Club in Bulawayo, where two debutants made history.Dewald Brevis set a world record for the fastest fifty in a debut Test innings, while Lhuan-dre Pretorius became South Africa's youngest Test centurion at 19 years and 93 days, breaking Graeme Pollock's 61-year-old record.The Test match, which falls outside the World Test Championship 2025-27 cycle, saw several regular South African players absent, creating opportunities for new talent to emerge. The team's decision to blood young players proved fruitful as both debutants delivered remarkable performances.Dewald Brevis, known for his association with Chennai Super Kings , demonstrated his aggressive batting style by scoring 51 runs off just 41 balls. His innings included three fours and four sixes, with his half-century coming in 38 balls, establishing a new record for the fastest fifty in a debut Test innings.The significance of Brevis's achievement becomes apparent when compared to previous records. While New Zealand's Tim Southee had scored a 29-ball fifty and England's Jacob Bethell achieved a 37-ball fifty on their debuts, both these performances came in their second innings.Brevis's record stands unique as it was accomplished in his first Test innings.The South African innings faced early trouble when the team lost their first four wickets for just 55 runs. However, Brevis and Pretorius formed a crucial 95-run partnership for the fifth wicket, steering their team away from difficulty.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Lhuan-dre Pretorius's achievement holds particular significance in South African cricket history. At 19 years and 93 days, he surpassed the long-standing record held by Graeme Pollock, who had scored his century against Australia in 1964 at 19 years and 317 days.The partnership between Brevis and Pretorius not only rescued South Africa from a precarious position but also showcased the depth of young talent in South African cricket. Their performance demonstrated the potential benefits of giving opportunities to young players in international cricket.The timing of these achievements gains additional context considering South Africa's recent World Test Championship victory. While this match against Zimbabwe doesn't contribute to the WTC 2025-27 cycle, it has provided a platform for emerging talents to make their mark in international cricket.The absence of regular team members, while potentially seen as a limitation, has opened doors for these young cricketers to showcase their abilities at the highest level. The success of both debutants validates South Africa's strategy of nurturing young talent and providing them with opportunities in international cricket.The historic achievements by both Brevis and Pretorius at the Queen Sports Club have added a significant chapter to South African cricket history, particularly in the context of Test cricket debuts and age-related records. Their performances have set new benchmarks for future generations of South African cricketers.","Dewald Brevis set a world record for the fastest fifty in a debut Test innings.

From backstage, standing beside Scott Swift—who showed full support by wearing Chiefs gear—Travis Kelce witnessed something unforgettable.During her performance, Taylor Swift changed a line in her song “Karma” to “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me,” a moment that clearly caught Kelce off guard.“I had no clue,” he later admitted on the New Heights podcast with his brother Jason Kelce. “Well, I might have had a little bit of a clue... But definitely when I heard it come out of her mouth, it still shocked me. I was like, ‘Oh sh*t. She really just said that.’”Kelce’s reaction—blushing, clapping, and visibly moved—was caught on video and widely shared across social media. But in the whirlwind of emotion, one tiny but memorable detail slipped past many: he accidentally left Taylor’s father hanging.Caught up in the moment, Kelce missed Scott Swift’s attempted high-five, a gesture that would have signaled a bonding moment between the two most important men in Taylor’s life. Though the moment passed quickly, Kelce later acknowledged the oversight, feeling a bit sheepish about it.Yet despite the awkwardness, the evening proved pivotal in the Swift-Kelce romance. The lyric change seemed to symbolize a shift in the seriousness of their relationship—from headline-making flings to a potential long-term future.Also Read: “Gayer than gay s*x”: Cowboys fan ridiculed for getting bizarre Travis Kelce tattoo to gain Taylor Swift's attention Since then, the couple has been spotted out on date nights, including a recent summer outing in New York City.

Aaron Rodgers’ ex Olivia Munn accuses his family of toxic behavior in fiery truth bomb,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-ex-olivia-munn-accuses-his-family-of-toxic-behavior-in-fiery-truth-bomb/articleshow/122170266.cms,"Olivia Munn is setting the record straight about her relationship with Aaron Rodgers (Getty images)

Olivia Munn finally clears the air on Aaron Rodgers’ family feud

Aaron Rodgers publicly defends Olivia Munn in new biography

For nearly a decade, actress Olivia Munn was wrongly cast as the villain in one of the NFL ’s most private family dramas. Now, the former partner of Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers is finally speaking out—firmly, honestly, and with surprising grace.Appearing on the Armchair Expert podcast with Dax Shepard , Olivia Munn directly addressed the long-standing narrative that she was the cause of Aaron Rodgers’ estrangement from his family during their 2014–2017 relationship. “There’s this whole big narrative that stayed with me for so many years,” Munn shared. “But there was just this dynamic in the family that had nothing to do with me.”While fans and tabloids speculated for years, Munn now confirms that Rodgers’ fractured ties with his family predated their relationship. “They didn’t speak for months before we started dating,” she said. In fact, she even urged Rodgers to reach out to them. Her encouragement, however, didn’t stop the world from unfairly blaming her for a situation she had no control over.The real twist came recently when Rodgers himself finally spoke on the matter in Ian O’Connor’s book Out of the Darkness. He made it crystal clear that his personal family issues were “deep-rooted” and had “nothing to do with” Munn.For Olivia, the moment of vindication was powerful—even though she was quietly battling breast cancer when those words surfaced. “I was really grateful that he did that. Even if people didn’t want to hear it, it made me feel good,” she said.Adding complexity to the story were clashes with Rodgers’ family values—especially with his mother, Darla. Munn recalled how her candid, sometimes provocative comments—like joking “I try to have s*x as much as I can” on live television—didn’t sit well with the deeply religious Rodgers family.Also post: NFL Rumors: Steelers ready to dump Aaron Rodgers if he flops, claims James Harrison Now married to comedian John Mulaney and focused on family and health, Munn appears content and unapologetic. By finally breaking her silence, she has reclaimed her narrative and brought long-overdue clarity to a chapter many thought they understood.In the end, she dropped the truth with calm conviction—and walked away with her head held high.","Olivia Munn finally addressed the long-standing narrative that she was the cause of Aaron Rodgers’ estrangement from his family during their 2014–2017 relationship.

Chris Paul is choosing between the Phoenix Suns and Los Angeles Clippers and everything is on the line,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/chris-paul-is-choosing-between-the-phoenix-suns-and-los-angeles-clippers-and-everything-is-on-the-line/articleshow/122170729.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

The Los Angeles Clippers could be the setting for Chris Paul ’s final act with James Harden by his side

Chris Paul has played for seven teams—but this time, the choice is deeply personal. After an all-games-played year with the Spurs, he’s down to just two options. Both are old homes. Both carry unfinished business. And whichever team he picks might not just get a player—they might get the closing chapter of one of basketball’s most respected careers.Chris Paul just wrapped up a season where he played every game for the Spurs and hit some major milestones—like being the first NBA player in his 20th season to start all 82 games and score 23,000 points with over 12,000 assists—now he’s gearing up for a final farewell. Insider Chris Haynes has confirmed that his choice is down to two teams he’s previously played for: the Clippers (2011–17) and the Suns (2020–23).For the Los Angeles Clippers, it would mark a full-circle moment. CP3 shone there for six seasons, with career averages of 18.8 points and 9.8 assists, solidifying a legacy associated with the city’s “Lob City” peak. Joining forces again with James Harden, who recently inked a two-year contract, he’d be part of a notable backcourt—even if his role could be more of a supporting one in their championship ambitions.Meanwhile, the Phoenix Suns still have some work to do: Paul guided them to the 2021 NBA Finals and assisted Phoenix in reaching a franchise-high 64 wins in 2021–22, with averages of 15.1 points and 9.5 assists over 194 games. Reunited with Devin Booker, he could step back into a pivotal playmaking position that marked one of the most exhilarating times in Suns history.Paul's decision is very personal. He openly stated that it's about family, stressing how crucial it is to be close to his wife Jada and their two children in Los Angeles after years of playing away. But basketball still matters: his last period with the Spurs demonstrated solid mentorship and consistent stats — proof that he still has valuable energy left.The Clippers are likely to provide a veteran to support Harden off the bench, while Phoenix could give him the chance to start again. Reddit is buzzing about this idea, “He will have a much bigger role on the Suns than he will playing next to Harden.”Coming back to the Clippers would be really meaningful and personal — it's a return to the city where he made a name for himself, close to family, and an opportunity to go for a championship without the pressure of being a starter.Also Read: Is LeBron James preparing to leave the Los Angeles Lakers after leaked talk of early retirement?

Could the Dallas Mavericks pull off another blockbuster trade to pairwith Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving? A new proposal suggests just that, shaking up the NBA landscape as James enters what might be his final season. LeBron James recently opted into his $52.6 million player option, securing his place for a record-breaking 23rd NBA season. However, his long-term future with the Los Angeles Lakers remains uncertain. With the team struggling to build a true championship contender in a stacked Western Conference, James could explore a trade before the 2025-26 season tips off.As Joe Mayo noted in the original report, ""James is reportedly weighing his options ahead of the 2025-26 campaign and could ultimately request a trade in what may be the final year of his legendary career.""

Adding James would solidify them as immediate title favorites. Here’s what Dallas gains:- A proven leader and playmaker in James.- A formidable trio of James, Davis, and Irving.- Increased championship odds in what could be James’ last season.For Los Angeles, this trade would mark a shift toward rebuilding around Luka Dončić. The Lakers would acquire:- A proven scorer in Klay Thompson.- Versatile defenders in P.J.

Boston Bruins lock down Michael DiPietro with over $800k deal

Boston doubles down on stability with a flurry of strategic re-signings

Just when it looked like Boston might lose one of its most promising netminders to free agency, the Bruins made a decisive move—re-signing goaltender Michael DiPietro to a two-year contract worth $812,500 per season. Totaling $1.625 million, the deal ensures that the 25-year-old AHL standout remains in the fold, anchoring Boston’s goaltending pipeline and signaling a strong vote of confidence in his future.Michael DiPietro, once buried in Vancouver’s system during the chaotic pandemic-era seasons, saw his career revitalized after a 2022 trade to the Bruins. His breakout 2024–25 campaign with the Providence Bruins was nothing short of dominant: a .927 save percentage, 2.05 goals-against average, and a 26-8-7 record earned him AHL All-Star honors and the Aldege ""Baz"" Bastien Memorial Award as the league’s top goaltender.With Group VI UFA eligibility looming, DiPietro had become one of the hottest names among available goalies. As ESPN’s Kevin Weekes noted, he was “the top goalie available among Group 6 free agents.” The Bruins’ front office clearly agreed, choosing to act before the July 1 deadline.But DiPietro wasn’t the only one staying put. Boston also extended several core young players ahead of the 2025–26 season, showcasing a commitment to internal development over splashy free-agent signings.Among the biggest deals: forward Morgan Geekie inked a six-year, $33 million extension after a strong campaign with increased minutes and power-play impact. Defenseman Mason Lohrei, a rising blue-line presence, received a two-year, $6.4 million deal as the team preps him for top-four duties.The team also re-signed Johnny Beecher ($900K for one year), Henri Jokiharju (three years, $3 million AAV), and Marat Khusnutdinov (two years, $925K AAV), among others. These depth moves reflect a calculated strategy of cap control, chemistry, and trust in the Bruins' system.Also post: NHL Trade rumors: Bruins looking to reunite with Brad Marchand as Maple Leafs and Panthers intensify free agency pursuit Rather than chasing headlines with blockbuster names, Boston is investing in its own.

Nicolas Hague brings size, experience, and championship pedigree

Vegas Golden Knights strengthen roster with experienced additions Jeremy Lauzon and Colton Sissons

Nashville Predators and Vegas Golden Knights adjust strategies with Nicolas Hague, Jeremy Lauzon, and Colton Sissons trade

On Sunday night, the Nashville Predators made a decisive move to reshape their defense, acquiring 26-year-old Nicolas Hague from the Vegas Golden Knights in a trade confirmed by ESPN, TSN, and Sportsnet. The Predators immediately secured his future with a four-year, $22 million extension ahead of free agency.The trade saw Nashville send defenseman Jeremy Lauzon and center Colton Sissons to Vegas. Finalized just before Hague could test the open market, the deal underscored the Predators’ urgency to strengthen their blue line with a player they view as a long-term solution. Nicolas Hague arrives in Tennessee with the kind of imposing presence NHL teams covet. Standing 6-foot-6 and weighing 245 pounds, he logged five goals and seven assists over 68 games last season for Vegas. His defensive impact showed in 82 hits, 74 blocks, and 18 takeaways—though it came with 56 giveaways and 40 penalty minutes.In 2022–23, he recorded a career-best 14 assists and three goals over 81 appearances, while leading Vegas defensemen with 154 hits and 154 blocks. Across his six NHL seasons, Hague has totaled 20 goals and 63 assists.Drafted 34th overall by the Golden Knights in 2017, he built his early career with the Mississauga Steelheads, setting their single-season scoring record for a defenseman and earning the Max Kaminsky Trophy as the OHL’s top blueliner before turning pro.Hague also holds a special place in Vegas history. He was the only player drafted by the Golden Knights to appear in the 2023 Stanley Cup Final, scoring in Game 5 to help secure the franchise’s first championship over the Florida Panthers.Heading to Vegas are Jeremy Lauzon and Colton Sissons, both set to become unrestricted free agents next offseason. Lauzon, 28, played 28 games for Nashville last season with one assist. A season earlier, he had career highs in goals (6), assists (8), hits (386), blocks (111), and penalty minutes (98) over 79 games.Sissons, 31, brings versatility at center, having tallied seven goals and 14 assists over 72 games last season. He hit a career-high 35 points in 2023–24 with 15 goals and 20 assists across 81 appearances.The trade marks an important shift for both franchises. Nashville prioritizes youth and stability on defense by locking in Hague before free agency. Meanwhile, Vegas adds experienced, physical depth with Lauzon on the blue line and Sissons up front—moves that could help them maintain roster flexibility and competitive balance in a tight salary-cap environment.Also Read: Washington Capitals stun NHL Draft with bold trade for 6'4"" German winger Maxim Schafer","Nicolas Hague, Jeremy Lauzon, and Colton Sissons traded from Vegas to Nashville.

TimesofIndia.com in Birmingham: As India trail 0-1 in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy following a disappointing loss at Headingley, all eyes are on the team’s spearhead, Jasprit Bumrah . The premier fast bowler is available for selection ahead of the second Test, but whether he takes the field remains uncertain.“Jasprit Bumrah is available but we haven’t made a call yet whether he will play this game or not,” India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate told reporters on Monday.Meanwhile, Nitish Kumar Reddy could be in line for his debut.

Nitish Kumar Reddy is very close to getting a game.

Yet, team management seems firm on playing the long game, prioritising Bumrah’s durability over short-term gains.As the second Test looms, India face a crucial decision — go all-in with Bumrah to level the series, or stick to the plan and back their depth. Either way, the management’s commitment to strategic rotation signals a shift in India’s approach: eyes not just on this series, but on sustaining success across formats.","India trail 0-1 in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy following a disappointing loss at Headingley.

It was also a day of numerous seeds falling and history being created by British players.Temperatures at the All England Club topped 32 degrees Celsius (89.6 Fahrenheit), surpassing the previous record of 29.3 Celsius set in 2001.Amid such conditions, Spain's Alcaraz had to dig deep for a 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1 win over Italy's retiring Fognini in a gruelling clash that lasted four hours and 37 minutes on Centre Court.It was only the first time since Roger Federer narrowly beat Alejandro Falla in 2010 that a defending champion had been taken to a fifth set in the Wimbledon first round.During the match, the 22-year-old Alcaraz rushed to help a spectator who had collapsed in the stands, handing over a bottle of water as medics came to the woman's aid.At the end of the match, Alcaraz pointed to Fognini in appreciation of the Italian's effort. Fognini later revealed his son Federico, an Alcaraz fan, was banned from speaking to the five-time major champion - leaving the youngster angry. To make up for it, Fognini asked Alcaraz for his shirt after the match as a gift for his son.Top women's seed Aryna Sabalenka used ice packs to stay cool during her 6-1, 7-5 win over Canadian qualifier Carson Branstine on Court One.The 27-year-old Belarusian, a three-time Grand Slam champion, has experienced tough three-set defeats in this year's Australian Open and French Open finals.Despite her success, she has never advanced beyond the Wimbledon semi-finals and missed last year's tournament due to a shoulder injury.“I felt really great. I'm super grateful to be healthy, ready to compete, and to have gotten through the first round,” Sabalenka said. Next, she will face Czech player Marie Bouzkova, ranked 48th in the world.As for Branstine, a professional model who funds her tennis by posing for the camera, it was a challenging day out in the sun as well. She needed six hair ties, hairspray for the bun and it still wasn't enough. Absence of a scrunchie didn't help either.Two-time Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur was visibly upset and tears streamed down her face as she withdrew from her first-round match against Viktoriya Tomova.The Tunisian player was behind 7-6 (7/5), 2-0 when she decided to withdraw against the Bulgarian, who is ranked 111th in the world.Meanwhile, Daniil Medvedev, a former US Open champion and a semi-finalist at Wimbledon for the past two years, experienced a meltdown during his match against France's Benjamin Bonzi.Bonzi won 7-6 (7/2), 3-6, 7-6 (7/3), 6-2 after three hours and seven minutes. An angry Medvedev smashed his racket against his chair at the conclusion of the match.In other results, Holger Rune lost after squandering a two-set lead, falling to Chile’s Nicolas Jarry. Former finalist Matteo Berrettini was also knocked out, and Stefanos Tsitsipas retired due to injury.Additionally, former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko was defeated by Britain’s Sonay Kartal in three sets, 7-5, 2-6, 6-2.In all, 10 seeds fell on the opening day - seven among men (Medvedev, Rune, Berrettini, Tsitsipas, Tallon Griekspoor, Alexei Popyrin, Francisco Cerundolo) and three among women (Paula Badosa, Ostapenko, McCartney Kessler)For British tennis, it had already been a record-breaking Wimbledon before the gates even opened at SW19. Twenty-three British players entered the singles draws - the highest since 1984. And not since 1976 have there been 14 Britons in action on Day 1 of Wimbledon.By the time day one concluded, well semi-concluded due to the 11pm curfew, seven (Emma Raducanu, Katie Boulter, Sonay Kartal, Cameron Norrie, Billy Harris, Arthur Fery and Oliver Tarvet) had progressed to the second round - the most in a single day in the Open Era. The list includes Tarvet and Fery, ranked 733 and 461 in the world, respectively. The 21-year-old Tarvet pocketed £99,000 for his first round win, except he can't make more than £7,290 a year due to the financial rules.“But I’m not here for the money,” he said after joking he'd hire a private jet to fly to the US where he's a college student. “I’m here just for the experience and to stamp my mark on the ATP circuit. And I think I’ve done a good job so far.”American No. 1 Taylor Fritz expressed frustration, saying, “I couldn’t do anything,” after making a dramatic comeback on No. 1 Court on Monday night.In his first-round match against Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, Fritz led in points and committed fewer errors after two sets. However, he found himself two sets down, losing two tiebreaks to the Frenchman, who has one of the biggest serves in the sport—larger than Fritz’s.Despite the odds, Fritz fought back to win the next two sets, including a dramatic fourth-set tiebreak. Trailing 5-1 and two points from defeat, he rallied to win. Jubilantly, he pumped his chest toward his box, yelled “let’s f—ing go,” and sat down, riding the momentum toward what he believed would be a victorious finis. Or so he thought.However, after a lengthy discussion with a tournament official, play was halted due to Wimbledon’s curfew, set at 11pm local time — even though it was only 10:18 pm when the match was paused. “Then don’t ask me,” Fritz said as he packed up his rackets and sat back in his chair, telling his box he “couldn’t do anything.”The All England Club confirmed that the match was suspended because of the curfew, which was 42 minutes away at the time. Remarkably, the previous four sets between Fritz and Perricard lasted 44, 48, 33, and 45 minutes, respectively, meaning only one of those sets could have been completed within the remaining time.","Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz survived a major scare at the hands of Fabio Fognini.
