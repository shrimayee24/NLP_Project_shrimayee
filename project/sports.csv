Late Drama and Rain-Shortened Day

Looking Ahead

The first Test between Zimbabwe and Afghanistan in Bulawayo ended in a thrilling draw on Monday, with both teams achieving record-breaking feats.Zimbabwe's first innings saw them amass a colossal 586 runs, surpassing their previous highest Test score of 563/9 against the West Indies in 2001. Afghanistan responded with an even more remarkable 699 all out, establishing their own record for the highest innings total, beating their previous best of 545/4, also achieved against Zimbabwe in 2021.The Afghan innings was highlighted by captain Hashmatullah Shahidi 's historic 246, a national record, and Rahmat Shah's 234. Together, they forged a massive 364-run third-wicket partnership, the highest in Afghanistan's Test history for any wicket. Shahidi’s 246 eclipsed his previous best of 200 against Zimbabwe in Abu Dhabi. Wicketkeeper Afsar Zazai also contributed a maiden Test century with 113 runs, further solidifying Afghanistan's dominance in their first innings.Zimbabwe's Brian Bennett, a 21-year-old spinner in only his second Test, showcased his all-around brilliance. Bennett took a career-best 5/95 in Afghanistan's innings and earlier contributed an unbeaten 110 with the bat in Zimbabwe's first innings.Afghanistan’s innings ended in a collapse, with the last six wickets falling for just 20 runs in four overs, largely due to Bennett's spin. In their second innings, Zimbabwe reached 142/4, avoiding further damage thanks to an unbroken 54-run partnership between veterans Sean Williams (35) and Craig Ervine (22).The match's conclusion was impacted by mid-afternoon rain, which caused a delay of over an hour. Zimbabwe showed resilience, with debutant Ben Curran impressing with 41 runs before a run-out, and opener Joylord Gumbie contributing 24.The second and final Test of the series begins Thursday, also in Bulawayo, with both teams eager to build on the momentum from this high-scoring encounter.For context, Sri Lanka still hold the record for the highest-ever Test innings score with 952/6 declared against India in Colombo in 1997.","The first Test between Zimbabwe and Afghanistan in Bulawayo ended in a thrilling draw on Monday.

Rohit Sharma press conference: On his batting, captaincy, future, Rishabh Pant’s shot and more

WATCH VIDEO

The closing stages of the Boxing Day Test between India and Australia in Melbourne were marred by controversy around Yashasvi Jaiswal 's caught-behind decision, which was given out by the third umpire.During the last session of the match, Jaiswal missed a pull shot against Pat Cummins and the ball went past his bat and gloves as the bowler went up in appeal, but the umpire shook his head in denial. Cummins signalled for a review straight away and the third umpire gave it out, overruling the on-field decision.Seeing no deviation on the 'Snickometer' during replays shown on the giant screen, Jaiswal had a long discussion with the umpires before walking back.Former players and experts remained divided in their opinion on the decision. However, a latest video released by the Australian media hints at Jaiswal possibly telling Travis Head that he did get a touch on the ball and the Australian batter could be seen raising his arms in delight, signalling 'out' to his teammates.The decision left India staring at a defeat, as Jaiswal, who scored 84, was the last hope to save the Test. But India slipped from 121 for 3 to 155 all out, resulting in a 184-run victory for Australia, which gave them a 2-1 lead in the five-match series with just the Sydney Test left to play.After the match ended, India captain Rohit Sharma was asked about his views on the controversial call during the press conference.He felt Jaiswal did get a touch.""It didn't show on Snicko, but with the naked eye there was a deflection. In all fairness, it looked like he touched it, but more often than not we fall on the wrong side of such decisions,"" Rohit said.Australia now need just a draw in the last Test at Sydney to reclaim the Border Gavaskar Trophy for the first time since 2014.","Yashasvi Jaiswal's caught-behind decision marred by controversy.

Taylor Swift Plans To Match Outfits With Travis Kelce’s Mother Donna Kelce



Travis Kelce Might Be Facing Some Pressure To Propose To Taylor Swift



It seems like the global pop star Taylor Swift and her relationship with the NFL star, Travis Kelce , is only getting stronger. Recently, a source close to the couple revealed to the Daily Mail, that whenever Taylor attends a match of her boyfriend as he plays for his team, Taylor makes sure her outfit matches Travis’ mother, Donna Kelce ’s outfit to “ensure everything aligns.”This makes sense because Taylor and Travis’ mother Donna Kelce have many a time twinned at the stadium while they cheer on Travis and his team in the NFL, the Kansas City Chiefs . Apparently, as per the source close to the couple, this move of Taylor’s has made Travis fall in love with her more since he finds this to be a beautiful gesture. The source revealed to the Daily Mail, ""Travis has always been flattered at Taylor wearing his team's colors when she attends his games and matching with his mom is something that he finds really touching.”Last month when Taylor attended the match when the Kansas City Chiefs went against the Las Vegas Raiders, she was spotted wearing a bright red sweatshirt from Louis Vuitton along with black pants. Travis’ mother Donna Kelce wore similar black pants and a black shirt with a hint of red color. While the red color was meant for the Kansas City Chiefs, fans went into a frenzy as they spotted Taylor and Donna matching their outfits.Many fans thought this was a coincidence that they both ended up matching their outfits but it looks like Taylor made sure to plan everything beforehand so that she could match with her future mother in law - a heartwarming move by the global pop star that touched both Travis, his family and their fans.While it looks like both Travis and Taylor have impressed each other’s families, as per a report, Travis’ family wants him to pop the big question to Taylor as soon as possible. Both Taylor and Travis are currently 35 years old with Travis being older than Taylor by two months. Most of Taylor’s Hollywood and music friends are either engaged or married and it seems like the pressure is getting to Taylor and Travis.Even though fans have speculated for the longest time about their engagement, apparently there is no truth to such rumours. As per a report by Daily Mail, Travis and Taylor find such engagement rumours about themselves hilarious and want to take their own time before deciding on such a big decision. Their close friends also want the fans to calm down and want the couple to take things slowly.At this moment, both Travis and Taylor are in New York City where they are spending the holiday season.Also Read: Taylor Swift is a billionaire, but the necklace she wore with Travis Kelce in NYC might not be as expensive as you'd guess","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are currently in New York City where they are spending the holiday season.

Why Did Tom Brady Call Sam Darnold's Throw 'Average' During The Monday Game?

NFL legend Tom Brady was one of the lead commentators at the Vikings-Packers match on Monday. Minnesota Vikings QB Sam Darnold threw for a career-high 377 yards and had his sixth game with at least six touchdown passes this year. Darnold also became the first quarterback in NFL history to record 14 wins in his first season. And while fans couldn't help but cheer the quarterback, Brady wasn’t so kind when he was calling plays for the match.Brady addressed Darnold's high frequency of being tackled in the pocket as he is the fourth-most-sacked quarterback in the league. And Brady eventually called one of Darnold’s throw-average during his commentary. “Kind of an average throw… but I will accept that,” Brady said about Darnold’s catch.While some fans agreed with him, Darnold’s fans did not take sides with Brady. One fan wrote, ""ya, you know what i'm gonna do? Challenge Tom Brady's ability to assess the quality of a throw from a quarterback. After I'm done with that, I'm gonna critique what Michael Phelps has to say about some dude's swimming stroke.”Also Read: Tom Brady makes blunder during the pregame introduction of the Green Bay Packers- Minnesota Vikings Week 17 Game A fan was quick to criticise Brady’s chops as a broadcaster. “Brady is the worst announcer.

After the win, Darnold joined Brady for a postgame interview. Darnold was named Brady's LFG Player of the Game for Week 17. When holding up his award, the quarterback asked Brady, ""Hey, what's LFG stand for?"" It became evident that Darnold was messing around, as he knew Brady could not use expletives on the air.""It's let's bleep go,"" Brady responded.Brady popularized this saying on his SiriusXM radio show ""Let's Go"" with Larry Fitzgerald and since joining Fox this season, the network has tried to adapt the phrase to Brady's games.",NFL legend Tom Brady was one of the lead commentators at the Vikings-Packers match on Monday.

Bills Head Coach Sean McDermott's Decisions Could Come Under Scrutiny If Team Loses

Reaction to Packers-Vikings, Jets-Bills, Broncos-Bengals, Chargers-Patriots | Colin Cowherd NFL

The Buffalo Bills have their work cut out for the new year. They recently scored a win against the New York Jets 40-14 which led them to the No. 2 seed in the AFC which means the team has the option to rest players on the road in New England as the game's result will have no bearing on their playoff matchup. They will soon host the #7 seed in the first round of the playoffs.This season, Bills head coach Sean McDermott has often come under fire for his approach to crucial situations especially his blunder against the Houston Texans in Week 5 which helped Houston secure the winning field goal despite having only seven seconds. NFL insider Colin Cowherd believes the coaching staff can be more key to the team’s fate than talented players like Josh Allen .Colin Cowherd addressed the pressure on McDermott during his podcast The Colin Cowherd Podcast. ""Josh Allen has been excellent [in playoffs]. If they get bounced early in the playoffs, and I know this sounds crazy, and I like Sean McDermott, but if Cincinnati got in and played Buffalo in the first round and Cincinnati won, I'm telling you, I think [Sean] McDermott is in trouble. Because when I watch this team. I don't want to hear about Josh Allen,” Cowherd said.Coaches typically don't get dismissed after making the playoffs, particularly when they secure a number two seed. While Josh Allen is considered one of the top quarterbacks in the NFL, the Buffalo team has lost quite a few games that they should have won, due to coaching decisions.Also Read: Is Bills Offensive Coordinator Joe Brady In Line To Replace Giants Coach Brian Daboll?

I am fascinated to watch Buffalo. They have to, at minimum, get to the conference championship at minimum, in my opinion,” Cowherd says.McDermott shared in his Monday conference that the team will rest some key players this week in advance of the postseason. ""What we're going to do is you'll see some starters out there playing, and you'll see some other players who we want to take a good look at. So it'll be a blend of both,"" McDermott said.Allen will start the game, and play only for a very brief time, according to McDermott.

When and where to watch Klay Thompson play tonight against the Houston Rockets tonight? (January 1, 2025)



is cleared for tonight’s game between theand the Houston Rockets. The Mavericks are set to face the Rockets in an important Western Conference matchup on January 1, 2025, at the Toyota Center in Houston. The game, scheduled for 8 p.m. EST, offers the Mavericks a chance to reverse their recent downturn despite missing several key players.In a significant boost to the team's prospects, Kyrie Irving has also been cleared to return after recovering from a right shoulder illness. Irving's return coincides with Klay Thompson's availability following his recent illness-related absence. ""Having both Irving and Thompson back gives us more offensive firepower and veteran leadership on the floor,"" a team spokesperson stated.However, the Mavericks continue to navigate challenges with several notable absences. Star player Luka Dončić remains sidelined with a left calf strain, while Dante Exum is out following right wrist surgery. The team will also miss Naji Marshall due to suspension, and Dereck Lively II's status remains questionable with a left hip contusion.The Mavericks enter tonight’s game with Klay Thompson and co. carrying a 20-13 record, maintaining their fourth-place position in the Western Conference despite recent setbacks.

""Every game in the Western Conference counts, and we're focused on getting back to our winning ways.""The matchup against the Rockets presents an opportunity for the Mavericks to demonstrate their power on the court and their overall depth.

Cricket Australia Men's Test of the Year 2024:

NEW DELHI: India's top bowler, Jasprit Bumrah , was selected by Cricket Australia to lead the Men's Test Team in 2024. The other Indian named in the varied playing XI, which includes players from six different nations, is opener Yashasvi Jaiswal The two Australian players that are included in the international 11 are bowler Josh Hazlewood and wicketkeeper-batter Alex Carey The team includes Matt Henry and Rachin Ravindra from New Zealand, as well as Joe Root Ben Duckett , and Harry Brook from England, who are all prolific hitters. The only representatives from their nations are Kamindu Mendis of Sri Lanka and Keshav Maharaj of South Africa.Throughout 2024, India's 22-year-old batting sensation Jaiswal displayed poise akin to that of an experienced player. His outstanding 161 in Perth proved to be the deciding factor, and his back-to-back double hundreds in February guaranteed a victory against England in the home Test series. Jaiswal set records for the most sixes (36) in a year worldwide and the most runs by an Indian opener in a calendar year.Despite losses, England's Duckett made an impression with his aggressive style, scoring hundreds in Rajkot (153) and Multan (114). His importance in England's offensive approach was highlighted by his strike rate of 87.04.In 2024, Root added six hundreds, including an undefeated 262 in Multan and twin hundreds against Sri Lanka at Lord's, to help England defeat Pakistan in a spectacular match. Another fantastic year was highlighted by his reliability and all-around performances, which included 11 wickets.For his valiant efforts in a historic series victory in India, including a game-winning 134 in the opening Test, Ravindra of New Zealand edged out Kane Williamson. Additionally, he scored a double-century at home against South Africa.With series-defining hundreds against New Zealand and a spectacular 317 in Multan, Brook demonstrated his ability to win games under pressure.Mendis of Sri Lanka, who started the season as a backup, matched Bradman's record by finishing with 1,000 runs in 13 innings. His four hundreds highlighted an exceptional year.With 46 dismissals, Australia's Carey was outstanding behind the wickets, and his undefeated 98 in Christchurch was among the top fourth-innings performances of the year.Henry's 5-15 against India demonstrated his importance as a bowler for New Zealand.With 71 wickets in 13 games at 14.92, Bumrah had a great 2024 season and was the year's most standout bowler.With a bowling average of under 14, Australia's Hazlewood continued to be excellent, and South Africa's Maharaj solidified his spot in this XI with crucial performances in back-to-back series victories.Yashasvi Jaiswal, Ben Duckett, Joe Root, Rachin Ravindra, Harry Brook, Kamindu Mendis, Alex Carey (wk), Matt Henry, Jasprit Bumrah (c), Josh Hazlewood, Keshav Maharaj","Cricket Australia Men's Test of the Year 2024: Jasprit Bumrah and Yashasvi Jaiswal.

NEW DELHI: The role of head coach Gautam Gambhir and his support staff in managing a squad in transition has also come into attention as Indian cricket struggles with the declining performance of its two batting mainstays, captain Rohit Sharma and senior batter Virat Kohli The team has had a tough time finding the ideal mix against an aggressive and highly motivated Australian team in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy . The fifth and final Test match, which India must win, will begin on Friday at the Sydney Cricket Ground.Off-field problems are also being brought on by the on-field roller coaster, as rumours of discontent in the dressing room start to spread like wild fire ahead of the series decider.Communication isn't as good as it was under previous coaches Rahul Dravid and Ravi Shastri , and it's been reported that Gambhir doesn't agree with the majority of the team's players.The captain, Rohit Sharma, has insisted that he discusses selection-related matters with each player individually. However, it is alleged that Rohit hasn't really explained to some of the more senior players why they were occasionally left out of the squad after Gambhir took over in July.Rohit's cause has not been aided by his own subpar batting form. However, it has also been consistently reported that Gambhir, who is seen as a more outspoken individual, has not gained much trust from the group of players, who are neither as old as Rohit or Kohli nor as inexperienced as Harshit Rana or Nitish Kumar Reddy.""There is a Test match to be played and then there is Champions Trophy . If the performance doesn't improve, even Gautam Gambhir's position wouldn't be safe,"" a senior BCCI official told PTI on conditions of anonymity.Also unclear at this time is Gambhir's relationship with the selecting committee.Because of his tendency to change around the starting eleven, certain players on the team are feeling nervous. Nitish Reddy has performed admirably in the current BGT, but there is still disagreement over how top-order batter Shubman Gill should be handled.BCCI secretary Jay Shah has now been elevated to the ICC chief's position and the Board won't have a full-time replacement until after January 12. The BCCI brass will have some thinking to do after that administrative stability is established.Shah made the decisions until he was in charge of BCCI. Roger Binny, the current president of the Board and a former Indian seamer, has not taken any calls pertaining to policy.However, Gambhir will undoubtedly have his wings clipped if Team India does not do noticeably better in the Champions Trophy in February or March.""He was never BCCI's first choice (it was VVS Laxman ) and some of the well-known overseas names didn't want to coach all three formats, so he was a compromise. Obviously, some other compulsions were also there,"" the official said.After the 0-3 loss to New Zealand at home, Gambhir has already been subjected to some difficult questions. If the Border-Gavaskar Trophy is also lost, things could get worse for the feisty former opener from Delhi's Old Rajinder Nagar.There is already a school of thinking that says Gambhir should only be in charge of the T20 team, where he has been a successful captain and mentor for the Lucknow SuperGiants and Kolkata Knight Riders.Whether he has been able to provide Virat Kohli with any answers regarding his constant dismissals in the off-stump channel outside is one issue that is being posed in the corridors of power. It would appear that the answer to that is a resounding negative.""Gautam, all his life, while playing in England and Australia, would dab the ball towards slip and gully. So, he knows exactly what Kohli's problem is. He has seen that as a player (in 2014) and as a commentator and now as a coach.""If he knows what is wrong, he should tell him,"" a former India great, with the experience of more than 90 Tests, said.One of the important members of the support staff, who is escorted to all the venues by his personal assistant, is the subject of additional developments that the BCCI Mandarins are monitoring.After games, the individual in issue would strut into the playing arena wearing a franchise jersey, demonstrating that he had FOP (Field Of Play) access during the IPL.According to a prominent source, his inclusion in the box honoring BCCI members hasn't been well received in Australia.","Head coach Gautam Gambhir and his support staff in managing a squad in transition.

NEW DELHI: Former India head coach Ravi Shastri has identified poor shot selection around the middle session on the final day as the key reason for India's loss in the Boxing Day Test , which also weakened their hold on the Border Gavaskar Trophy.While avoiding specific names, Shastri pointed out that the dismissals of ""two senior players and a youngster"" would be subject to detailed analysis.In his column for The Daily Telegraph, Shastri wrote: ""It was amazing to see the Indian crowds having travelled from all parts of the globe to come and experience Test cricket at its best at the 'G.""He continued: ""Unfortunately for them, some poor shot selection on either side of the middle session on the final day cost India the game. And probably has ensured that India may have lost their grip on the Border-Gavaskar Trophywith one Test to go.""The performances of captain Rohit Sharma , Virat Kohli, and Rishabh Pant in the fourth Test have drawn criticism, as Australia secured a 184-run victory to lead 2-1 in the series.To retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Team India needs a victory in the Sydney Test , while Australia can reclaim the trophy for the first time since 2014-15 with either a draw or win.The technical and mental difficulties faced by Rohit and Kohli, coupled with Pant's poorly executed pull shot to long-on, led to a significant collapse in the second innings.""There will be a few other second-innings dismissals that will be scrutinised in India as well, involving two senior players and a youngster. Three very loose shots,"" Shastri observed.The contrasting captaincy performances were notable, with Pat Cummins, who earned the player of the match award, showing excellence while Rohit struggled considerably.""It doesn't help when one of it involved the captain who is struggling. Also doesn't help when Cummins raises his game to a scale of 8 or 9 when up against his counterpart, who is at the opposite end of the scale,"" Shastri concluded.","Former India head coach Ravi Shastri has identified poor shot selection around the middle session on the final day as the key reason for India's loss.

Travis Hunter’s Mother Silences His Haters



The Trolling Began When Travis Hunter Received The Heisman Trophy



Travis Hunter , the college football star, ended his college football career by losing to the BYU Cougars at the 2024 Alamo Bowl. As he exited the venue, Travis walked hand in hand with his fiancee Leanna Lenee and ignored his fans which sparked widespread criticism, But amidst all the hate he and his fiancee Leanna have received over the last few weeks, his mother has stood by him and now has sent a powerful message to all his haters.Travis Hunter’s mother, Ferrante Edmonds, recently posted a picture on her Instagram where she is posing with her son on the field. The mother son duo look very excited and happy in the picture that she posted. Travis Hunter’s mother’s caption reads as, “I love you, baby @db3_tip, on to the next level. I’m so proud of you.”While Travis’ mother has plenty of things to be proud of her extremely talented son, the timing of this post makes it all the more special. In a way, it looks like Travis’ mother sends a message to all his haters that she stands by him no matter what happens. Many fans appreciated this gesture of hers as one wrote, “We are proud of him so I know as his mother you are extremely proud. Let’s go Travis!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾”. Another fan complimented her and how she has brought up her son by saying, “You are a great mom who has instilled integrity and humility and Travis. Proud of him and proud of you!”This is also not the first way that Travis’ mother, Ferrante Edmonds, has openly declared her support for him. While Travis has been getting a massive amount of hate in the last couple of weeks, his mother posted a picture with Travis and her younger son Trayvis from the Heisman Trophy night with a caption that read as, “I fight my battles in the Spiritual Realm not in the Natural. Everything that is said don’t need to be addressed. If I’m Silent Best Believe I’m Praying. #ThisIsHowIFightMyBattles🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 #PrayingMother 🙏🏾”While Travis’ mother has not specifically addressed any issues, it is safe to assume she is referring to the controversy surrounding Travis’ fiancee Leanna and the trolling they have received as a couple.Coincidentally, all the trolling began on the day that was supposed to be a highly memorable day for Travis; the day he became the recipient of the prestigious Heisman Trophy. His fiancee Leanna did not stand up for him and moved only when his coach, Deion Sanders nudged him to stand up.This video quickly went viral shocking fans at this gesture of Leanna’s and left many fans questioning her love for Travis.

Taylor Swift Did Not Sell The Maximum Tickets In Australia



Travis Kelce And Taylor Swift Are Currently Relaxing In New York City



The NFL star and the quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs, Travis Kelce is currently dating the most popular global pop star, Taylor Swift . While Taylor’s legendary Eras Tour generated a revenue of $2.2 billion, it turns out another artist in Australia sold more tickets (across Australia) than Taylor. This is none other than the popular pop star, Pink who is also known by her real name Alicia Moore.However, things were not easy for Pink when global pop star Taylor was performing in Australia. Even though Pink sold many more tickets than Taylor, Australian media was busy promoting and talking about Beyonce and Taylor’s tour rather than hers. As per Sam Fischer's interview on Nova’s Ricki-Lee, Tim & Joel, he said, “I have a friend who's Pink's background singer and my friend Danny said she's really just pi**ed off no one's talking about the fact that she's also selling out stadiums.”Pink sold out stadiums and yet no media promoted it that much. Pink had expressed gratitude to her audience and as per Daily Mail, Pink has also spoken about how she has the record for the maximum number of ticket sales held by a female artist who has performed in Australia.Pink has been performing in Australia for the last twenty years of her life and Michael Coppel of the Live Nation Australasia spoke to the Herald Sun about this. He said, “There is a palpable mutual love affair between the Australasian audience that love seeing her perform live, and an artist who clearly loves being here. Congratulations, Alecia, on yet another stunning record-breaking tour.”While it is unfortunate that Pink did not get as much media attention as Taylor did but Taylor herself has broken several records through the Eras Tour. With a revenue of $2.2 billion, her tour became the second most attended concert in the world, just a close second to Coldplay’s “Music of the Sphere.”In Australia itself, Travis’ girlfriend Taylor managed to sell 600,000 tickets. Taylor travelled the world for it and visited each continent for her Eras tour. Finally, Taylor managed to wrap up her Eras tour on 8th December after her final performance in Canada.Currently, Taylor has not announced any new project of hers and is enjoying her break in New York City with her boyfriend, Travis Kelce. Taylor has been spotted going out and about in the Big Apple, hand in hand with her boyfriend. She has recently been spotted on a date night and while celebrating her best friend’s birthday and fans cannot get enough of the two.While Travis is yet to enter the playoffs with his team next month, there has been no official statement from Taylor about her next project.Also Read: Buffalo Bills' Josh Allen’s fiancée Hailee Steinfeld becomes a part of the Bills’ family through a special gift","Pink sold out stadiums and yet no media promoted it that much.

In Indian cricket, sentimental retirements have often masked larger issues of selection & form. Superstars have usually extended playing careers and scripted their own exits. For India's captain, however, retirement talk is gathering steam ahead of the Sydney Test. For

, too, holding on to his spot looks increasingly difficult with each failure. Only one may be left standing after the final Test of this tour

Poll Who is your favorite Indian cricket captain of the modern era? Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma

Rohit Sharma press conference: On his batting, captaincy, future, Rishabh Pant’s shot and more

MELBOURNE: Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli aren't cut from the same cloth, but their careers are definitely fraying at the edges at the same time.With every predictable dismissal, the end is looming. It's not here yet. Maybe tomorrow. Or perhaps the day after. It must be an infuriating wait for these two declining stalwarts.Rumours are swirling as the caravan prepares to enter Sydney for the last stop on the Border-Gavaskar Trophy tour. Perhaps captain Rohit, the lesser of the two Test batsmen, will have his head on the chopping block first. If India don't make the World Test Championship final, Sydney, it is being presumed, could be Rohit's final port of call, a last chance to sign off with a hurrah.Kohli's may be a longer wait. A modern Test great, he still has time if he so chooses. Kohli still looks the part in patches, though the mind seems scrambled. It's getting easier and easier for opposition bowlers to plan his dismissals. Or, perhaps, there will be redemption round the corner, a Steve Smith-like turnaround, and a few more great knocks to add to the lore? The temptation to linger on is irresistible.Of course, a Rohit retirement now would be extremely convenient for the Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee. Celebrity worship and brand recognition is so deeply entrenched in Indian cricket's cloak-and-dagger management style that coaches and selectors struggle to make the tough calls.Even now, with the series on the line, the chatter - no doubt fuelled by whispers from within the machine - is always about 'retirement', never about performance. Indian cricket's super stars, apart from one or two exceptions, have never shared a healthy relationship with being dropped, or with the dreaded 'R' word.For selectors, too, 'retirement' makes it easier. The call appears to be voluntary. Just look at the way Ravichandran Ashwin bid goodbye in Brisbane.The talk should instead be about holding on to one's spot. Retirement, irrespective of age, is a personal thing and not the issue here. If a player doesn't perform, he cannot keep his place. Great players get a longer rope, but it still runs out at some point. What he subsequently decides to do with his playing career - retire or keep playing - is his own call to make. Whether to pick him or not is the call of the selectors and the coach, if he has a say in such matters.Unfortunately, that isn't how Indian cricket, or even its rabid fans, function. There are two ways to look at the Rohit problem which has dogged the team since the pink-ball Test in Adelaide. Going by performance benchmarks alone, his spot in the playing XI in Sydney shouldn't be a guarantee, even if he is the captain or it turns out to be his last Test with the Indian team. Ashwin, after all, didn't play in Brisbane.Rohit's problem isn't limited to Australian soil. He averages 24.76 from 26 innings in 2024. This includes two hundreds and two half-centuries. In India's last five defeats, he averages 11.20 from 10 innings. His last 11 Test innings have brought him returns of 2 and 52, 0 and 8, 18 and 11 (all vs New Zealand at home), 3, 6, 10, 3, 9 (all in Australia on this tour).Even as captain, his overseas record is middling. He has led in eight overseas Tests, losing four, winning two and drawing two. In these Tests, with the bat Rohit averages 29.92, which includes that magnificent 127 at the Oval. Before arriving here, India were whitewashed at home by New Zealand, an unthinkable blow. India have now lost five Tests under Rohit this season, equalling Sachin Tendulkar 's record from 1999-2000.Numbers, though, aren't everything when it comes to batsmen of pedigree. Rohit just hasn't looked like his old self out there in the middle. In Adelaide he took a blow for the team, shifting to the middle order from his regular opening slot since KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jasiwal had just engineered a Test win in Perth along with Jasprit Bumrah The move didn't work and at the MCG he batted better after returning as opener, though the runs still didn't come. In the first innings he was caught in two minds playing his favourite pull shot. In the second he stood firm with a Test to save, and some of that laidback swagger looked like returning when he perished trying to play an attacking shot.The other way is to treat it as an issue of form. While it's easy to gauge from the numbers - he has 164 runs in 15 innings this season, starting with the Tests against Bangladesh - that Rohit has had a horror run, it's been only four months or so, from September 19 (start of the Chennai Test against Bangladesh) till the end of the year. Some famous batters have been known to nurse poor form for far longer. So why talk of retirement and not form, even though Rohit is inching towards 38 years of age?Either way you look at it, Rohit's selection in Sydney shouldn't be an automatic choice. Kohli is in a similar bind but with a significant difference. With Kohli, the numbers make for equally dreary reading - he averages 24.52 this year - but he is at a superior level compared to Rohit as a Test batsman. The debate is different.Plus, he has a century in Perth on this tour, the one time he got to bat against the older Kookaburra ball. He has shown self-restraint. The first-innings 36 from 86 balls at the MCG was a small but significant knock which earned praise from the likes of Smith.Kohli's problem has been both technical - a tendency to reach out and drive at deliveries on the fifth or sixth stump line with askew footwork - and mental, motivated by the urgency to score some quick runs, since the runs aren't coming. The two are linked.Kohli too, has been in a long, gradual decline since the first Covid-enforced break. There could still be some gas left in the tank. Kohli may still have a prolific season or two in him. However, on current form, does he deserve to keep his place? Who can replace him at No. 4 in the present squad? These are questions the team management has to answer.As for Rohit, is this the end of the line? Sydney will provide.","Retirement talk is gathering steam ahead of the Sydney Test.

The qualification process is the issue and I’m sure it’s something Jay Shah will fix,"" he wrote, urging theICC Chairman to address the apparent inequality.Under the current system, PCT determines standings by dividing a team’s earned points by the maximum points available from matches played.While it incentivises consistent performance, disparities in the number of fixtures unfairly penalise teams with heavier schedules.England, for instance, played twice the matches South Africa did. This broader schedule naturally exposed them to a greater risk of point loss, leading to their exclusion from the final despite notable performances.The disparity extends across the table, with Australia (16 matches) and India (18 matches) rounding out the top three, while teams like Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, who play fewer matches, remain competitive largely because they face less fixture fatigue.Critics, including Pietersen, argue this creates an uneven playing field and compromises the credibility of the final standings.As the June 11 final approaches, the debate over the WTC’s structure calls for urgent reform.","Kevin Pietersen has expressed his dissatisfaction with the World Test Championship qualification process. South Africa made the final despite playing only 11 matches during the 2023-25 cycle. England, who played a demanding 22 matches, sit sixth despite winning 11 games - the highest by any team.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116844945,imgsize-38664,width-400,resizemode-4/116844945.jpg"

Patrick Mahomes’ Mother Poses Happily With Her Friends On New Year's Eve



How Patrick Mahomes Is Celebrating The Holiday Season

Patrick Mahomes ’ mother, Randi Martin , seemed to have a good time on New Year’s Eve. She recently posted a picture where she posed with her friends at what seemed to be like her home. She posed funnily with her friends as she looked stunning in a white top and a glittery long skirt. She kept her hair open and opted for a necklace and hoops to complete the look. She also opted for white sneakers to match her whole look. Her caption read as, “Happy New Years.”This picture of Patrick’s mother, Randi Martin, is like a breath of fresh air as in the last few days, she has constantly appealed to her followers to send prayers for her sick father. Neither Patrick nor his family has revealed the cause behind his grandfather’s ill health but it seems like Patrick’s grandfather, Randy Martin, has been suffering for a long time now.He was first hospitalised in September but then was discharged the following month. Patrick’s mother, Randi, had also posted pictures from their Thanksgiving celebration with her entire family as fans saw Patrick’s grandfather was back at home, looking healthy. But it seems like he has again gotten sick and Patrick’s mother has been upset about it.She also lost her mother last year in April after a tough battle with cancer so it looks like 2024 was a year full of ups and downs for Patrick’s mother, Randi Martin.Patrick actually could not celebrate Christmas with his family as he was busy playing for his team, the Kansas City Chiefs against the Pittsburgh Steelers but he made sure to give early Christmas Day gifts to his children which included luxury miniature cars for them to ride on.While it is not known how the NFL star and the Kansas City Chiefs’, Patrick Mahomes celebrated his New Year’s Eve but it seems like he is with his family. As per reports, the head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs has decided to give a break to Patrick and his teammate, the Chiefs’ tight end, Travis Kelce so that they can rest and catch up with their families.Patrick had also revealed in a recent interview that he and his wife, Brittany Mahomes, is gearing up for the birth of their third child, a daughter, and that his wife is due “any time now”. He had also wished for his third child to be born during the mini bye week, which is the ongoing week, but it does not look like that has happened.Patrick had a great season this year and had the support of his whole family. His wife, Brittany Mahomes and his mother, Randi Martin have been spotted quite a few times supporting Patrick.Also Read: The reason police and NFL security were spotted at Rams' QB Matthew Stafford’s $28 million mansion in LA","Patrick Mahomes’ mother, Randi Martin, posted a picture with her friends on New Year’s Eve.

Rohit Sharma press conference: On his batting, captaincy, future, Rishabh Pant’s shot and more

Pat Cummins on India’s approach on Day 5, Rishabh Pant’s shot and Travis Head’s celebration

SYDNEY: Dark clouds are gathering over Indian cricket heading into the Sydney Test . This has been a long, strange trip marked by a series of bizarre missteps from the side. The auspicious winning start in Perth has been followed by abject defeat in Adelaide, a lucky rain-hit draw in Brisbane and the shocking collapse on the last day in Melbourne after India showed resolve to stretch the game.What has followed is standard practice whenever the team hits a rough patch and the leadership is in turmoil — ugly dressing room leaks, rumours of disquiet and division, talk of high-handedness from the coach and whispers of opportunists waiting to seize their moment.It’s all happened in Indian cricket before and will again, but this team this time is in a prickly situation, on an important tour where some of their senior batters have failed collectively. Big changes loom and there could be chaos ahead.Perhaps the signs of trouble were there from the start of the tour, when Ravichandran Ashwin supposedly took umbrage at being ignored for Washington Sundar in Perth. That development was evident much later, in the third game at the Gabba, where Ashwin — not even in the playing XI — retired in a huff and returned home the same day. His father later said Ashwin had been “humiliated”, a strong insinuation. Ashwin tried to play down the issue, without much success it must be said, by saying his father wasn’t “media-trained”.There were other signs of muddled thinking. Captain Rohit Sharma ’s delayed entry into the series saw him give up his regular opening role in Adelaide, another peculiar decision since KL Rahul was touted as a stop-gap option for Perth. The reason cited was the important Rahul-Jaiswal contribution at the top, but by that logic the captaincy should also have stayed with Jasprit Bumrah, since he led the side to victory in the first Test. Perhaps Rohit wasn’t confident enough about his Test form, which has tapered off for a while.Australia is, all said and done, a difficult place for batters from the subcontinent. Rohit’s meagre returns in the middle order and the subsequent attempt to reclaim his opening slot seemed to upset the balance of the side. Shubman Gill, who has a poor overseas record but had got off to good starts in Adelaide, was made to sit out as Rahul took the No. 3 spot at the MCG.A skipper who prevaricates when asked about his batting spot in media conferences is never a good sign. No wonder Rohit’s captaincy too had been patchy until Australia’s second innings in the Boxing Day Test, when he seemed to rouse himself from despondency after Nitish Kumar Reddy’s wondrous ton.In another perplexing move, a bevy of batting allrounders with minimal bowling contributions have added to Jasprit Bumrah’s burden. Some of the bad shots played by some senior batters have also been mystifying. By now, every cricket-watcher in Australia knows how Virat Kohli will get out — needlessly fishing outside off stump.Rishabh Pant’s ‘once-more-unto-the-breach’ approach against Travis Head, with a Test match waiting to be saved, defied belief. So did Yashasvi Jaiswal’s run-out, three dropped catches and constant run-ins with Sam Konstas at the MCG. It is perhaps an indication Jaiswal is still a bit green, and not yet the steely big-match player India expects him to be.Perhaps the signs of trouble were there from before this Australia trip, when India were whitewashed by New Zealand at home, a red flag if ever there was one. Maybe it was earlier still, when Gautam Gambhir stepped into Rahul Dravid’s big shoes as coach without any prior formal coaching experience.Gambhir’s time as mentor of Lucknow Super Giants and Kolkata Knight Riders, where he experienced an IPL-winning high this season, was deemed enough for him to take on a completely different role as India coach. Gambhir is an inspirational character with strong beliefs who is emotionally attached to Indian cricket. However, he isn’t very hands-on as coach, judging from the nets sessions here in Australia.It seems like he has delegated routine jobs like providing technical inputs, giving throwdowns and planning training sessions to the likes of Abhishek Nayar. The rest of the support staff, apart from the former bowling titan Morne Morkel, lack both the experience and persona to guide some Test-match giants in the team.The previous on-field run-ins with Kohli in past IPL seasons became an immediate talking point when Gambhir was appointed. The Rohit-Gambhir combine too hasn’t clicked so far, apart from the twin victories against Bangladesh at home. Now there are alleged reports the coach had given himself six months to “observe” proceedings and will now become more proactive.It beggars belief but if true, makes for another disruptive twist in the tale.This disjointed set-up now arrives in Sydney more hopeful than confident of pulling off a series-levelling victory. Australia have been galvanized into action as a unit under Pat Cummins’ leadership and versatile cricketing skills. Some of their biggest batters have rediscovered form. India’s captain, meanwhile, is staring at retirement.This last Test of the series could be a bumpy ride for India unless the team puts all supposed differences aside immediately. There’s talk of rain in the air and the Sydney Cricket Ground may not be the dry, spin-friendly batting track it used to be.“There’s nice grass coverage,” said Australia’s wicketkeeper Alex Carey, and while that could be a red herring, the conditions might pour cold water on India’s ambitions. It may fall on Bumrah, the sole bright spot who has carried the team on his bowling arm, to again dispel the gloom.","Dark clouds are gathering over Indian cricket heading into the Sydney Test.

Pat Cummins on India’s approach on Day 5, Rishabh Pant’s shot and Travis Head’s celebration

NEW DELHI: As the Indian team stares at a tough transition following the floundering in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, it has emerged that coach Gautam Gambhir is struggling to stay on the same page with the selectors and the team.There are strong suggestions that there could be ideological differences in the manner in which Gambhir approaches his job, resulting in the team finding it difficult to adjust to his ways. TOI understands that Gambhir’s communication skills with the team are currently a bone of contention.Gambhir is known to be strong-headed and a hard taskmaster in his ways when he led Delhi and Kolkata Knight Riders over the past decade. Gambhir’s interactions, it has been learnt, have been minimal and very objective with the players on tour.“He has let the players be so far. Now, he must take responsibility and come to the fore,” BCCI sources told TOI, “The young players who are missing out even from the XI are not being talked to yet. It could make them doubt themselves. The previous team managements were more empathetic and spoke a lot to the players. The players are still adjusting to Gambhir’s new ways.”Captain Rohit Sharma, fighting for a place in the XI too hasn’t helped the dressing room. BCCI insiders also pointed to a transformed – and vague – vision in this period of transition.“There’s no harm in having a vision. But there needs to be a definite one. Gambhir is trying to balance things. In doing so, he is figuring out the players he wants to back. It’s almost like he is still struggling to come out of how an IPL franchise functions. There are proven performers in the team. He is mindful of not disturbing them,” the source said.“If one goes by the team sheets that the team management has released in the last four Test tours, there are players missing out from featuring in the 15 when they were initially picked as the top 15 players to travel to Australia. It clearly shows there’s a lack of clarity between the selectors and the team management,” the source added.It must be noted that the selectors gave in to Gambhir’s demand of picking Harshit Rana despite his lack of first-class experience. Rana was not even in the 15 for the last Test at Melbourne. The Indian team has suffered horrid results since Gambhir took charge from Rahul Dravid in July last year.BCCI sources said that Gambhir has come in with a vision to revamp the teams across formats. It is said that Gambhir is looking at a period of around 18 months to rebuild the team. Chief selector Ajit Agarkar has been in Australia right through the tour to work on a common vision with Gambhir.TOI had reported on November 20 last year that the team management and selectors would be speaking with the senior players about their future plans. Rohit, Virat Kohli, R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja were on top of the list. But BCCI sources feel Ashwin’s retirement was poorly handled by the team management.As far as Rohit is concerned, it is unlikely he would be in the Test plans after Australia but whether he announces his retirement when the team is facing such tough times is something up for question. There’s a chance that he may hold the decision for a while to let the dust settle. In such a scenario, Kohli seems to have assumed a leadership role again, being more vocal in the field and frequently addressing team huddles.There seems to be a lack of faith in the younger generation of players in the way they prepare going into a game.Performance of support staff to be reviewed by BCCITOI has also learnt that the BCCI will review Gambhir and his support staff’s performance after the Australia tour like it was done after India suffered 0-3 defeat against New Zealand in October-November last year.There are question marks on Abhishek Nayar’s role as a batting coach and the purpose of fielding coach Ryan ten Doeschate when T Dilip has already been doing a good job for the last three years.",Gambhir's communication skills with the team are currently a bone of contention.

As the match ended, cricket memes went viral on social media platforms. Here are some of the viral memes that just capture the emotion/sadness of Indian Cricket fans.

Record number of spectators

Australia clinched a thrilling 184-run victory over India in a dramatic final session of the fourth Test in Melbourne, taking a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. India, needing 340 to win, collapsed to 155 all out, losing their last seven wickets for just 34 runs in 20.3 overs. India appeared to be heading for a draw after Yashasvi Jaiswal (84) and Rishabh Pant (30) steered them to 112-3 at tea. However, Pant's dismissal, attempting a six off Travis Head, triggered a batting collapse.Controversy arose with Jaiswal's dismissal. Initially given not out to a caught-behind appeal, the TV umpire overturned the decision based on visual evidence of the ball changing direction, despite the absence of audible noise. Jasprit Bumrah was exceptional for India, taking 5-57 in the second innings and nine wickets in the match. He had reduced Australia to 91-6 at one stage, a lead of less than 200.The match set a record attendance for cricket in Australia, with 373,591 spectators. Head described the atmosphere as inspiring and hailed the match as one of the best he has been involved in. India now needs to win the final Test in Sydney to level the series and retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .","Australia beat India by 184 runs in the fourth Test in Melbourne.

Why Pat Cummins laughed when he was asked about facing Jasprit Bumrah

NEW DELHI: Australia captain Pat Cummins lauded India’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah , acknowledging his exceptional form and consistent ability to trouble batters across all formats. Speaking ahead of the fifth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Cummins admitted that facing Bumrah is always a daunting task.""Bumrah is bowling well at the moment. He is always tough,"" Cummins said during the pre-match press conference. ""Hopefully, by the time I come in, late in the day, he has bowled quite a bit, which might make it a bit easier for me. But he is bowling well. I’ve faced him quite a bit across the world in different formats, and he always poses a challenge.""In a lighthearted comment, Cummins added, ""Last game, it helped as I was at the non-striker’s end. That certainly helped [laugh].""Australia, leading the series 2-1, have the chance to secure the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the first time since 2014-15 with a win or draw in Sydney. Victory would also guarantee their place in the World Test Championship final at Lord’s in June against South Africa.In addition to praising Bumrah, Cummins confirmed a few changes in Australia’s lineup . Allrounder Mitch Marsh has been dropped following a string of underwhelming performances, with Beau Webster set to make his debut.""Mitchy obviously hasn’t quite got the runs or wickets he would have liked this series and felt like it was time for a freshen up,"" Cummins explained. ""Beau’s been with the squad and been great. It’s a shame for Mitchy because we know how much he brings to the team, but we feel like now is a good time for Beau to get a chance."" Mitchell Starc , despite carrying a rib niggle, has been retained and will feature in the bowling attack alongside Cummins, Scott Boland, and Nathan Lyon. Starc’s inclusion underscores his significance, with Cummins remarking, ""He was never going to miss this one.""","Pat Cummins hails Jasprit Bumrah's form and ability to trouble batters.

Australia captain Pat Cummins has confirmed that Beau Webster will make his Test debut in the fifth and final match of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against India, starting Friday at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). Webster is set to become Australia's 469th men’s Test player.Webster replaces out-of-form allrounder Mitch Marsh, who has struggled to make an impact with both bat and ball throughout the series. Marsh has managed just 73 runs at an average of 10.42, prompting selectors to opt for Webster as a stronger batting option in the top six.Webster’s impressive recent first-class bowling performances also played a role in the decision, offering additional depth to Australia’s attack, especially with the short turnaround after their fifth-day victory in Melbourne.Australia lead the series 2-1 and will look to seal the contest in Sydney with a fresh combination.Cummins, speaking ahead of the match, expressed confidence in Webster’s ability to contribute to the team’s performance. Webster, known for his all-around capabilities, adds a new dynamic to Australia's lineup.""Mitchy obviously hasn't quite got the runs or wickets he would have liked this series and felt like it was time for a freshen up,"" said skipper Cummins. ""Beau's been with the squad and been great. It's a shame for Mitchy because we know how much he brings to the team, but we feel like now is a good time for Beau to get a chance.""Marsh’s omission comes after a string of below-par performances in the series, making way for Webster to step in and showcase his skills on the grand stage. The SCG Test presents a golden opportunity for Webster to cement his place in the national side.Meanwhile, pace spearhead Mitchell Starc has been cleared to play despite nursing a rib niggle. ""He was never going to miss this one,"" Cummins said, emphasizing Starc’s commitment to the team.Australia will look to their revamped lineup to deliver a strong performance and wrap up the series against a competitive Indian team.","Beau Webster will make his Test debut in the fifth and final match of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against India.

NEW DELHI: Team India head coach Gautam Gambhir was seen having an intense one-on-one discussion with star pacer Jasprit Bumrah , away from the rest of the squad, at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). India, currently trailing 1-2 in the five-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy , is preparing for the series-deciding fifth Test starting Friday.While Gambhir and Bumrah engaged in their conversation, other players, including Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma , Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sarfaraz Khan, Dhruv Jurel, and Ravindra Jadeja, were seen warming up and playing a game of football. Meanwhile, Shubman Gill worked on his fielding alongside Washington Sundar.Following his discussion with Bumrah, TimesofIndia.com can confirm Gambhir then had a chat with chief selector Ajit Agarkar.This interaction further fueled speculation about unrest in the dressing room, but Gambhir promptly dismissed such reports as unfounded.“Discussions between the coach and players should stay in the dressing room. Stern words may be exchanged, but those reports of unrest are not true,” Gambhir clarified during the pre-match press conference.“Indian cricket will remain in safe hands as long as honesty prevails in the dressing room. Performance is the only factor that secures a player's place,” he added.Gambhir emphasized the value of open and honest communication, stating, “There were honest conversations, and honesty is critical in this setup.”Addressing rumors of issues with senior players, Gambhir confirmed that his discussions with Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have been focused solely on strategies to win matches.“Every individual understands their areas of improvement. Our sole focus has been on strategizing to win games,” Gambhir explained.On the injury front, Gambhir announced that pacer Akash Deep would miss the final Test due to a stiff back, likely caused by his heavy workload of 87.5 overs across two matches. He did not reveal a replacement for Akash Deep.“Akash Deep is out with a back issue,” Gambhir said, adding that the final playing XI would be decided after assessing the pitch conditions.","Team India head coach Gautam Gambhir seen having an intense one-on-one discussion with Jasprit Bumrah.

So, it's unfortunate that India aren't travelling to Pakistan for this Champions Trophy.""The ICC Men's Champions Trophy 2025, scheduled from February 19 to March 9, marks the return of the global tournament after its last edition in 2017.

""It's gonna be huge for the Pakistan cricket fans to be able to have the opportunity to watch world-class cricket in the country,"" he said.Reflecting on his own experience playing in Pakistan during the Pakistan Super League (PSL) in 2019, Watson shared his admiration for the fans' passion for the sport. ""I got a small opportunity to play in the Pakistan Super League in 2019, the first time after playing there in 2005. It was one of the highlights of my career. To go to Pakistan after a long time and see the love and joy they have for cricket was incredible. They were starved of world-class live cricket,"" Watson noted.With eight teams divided into two groups, the tournament promises intense competition. Group A features Pakistan, India, New Zealand, and Bangladesh, while Group B includes Afghanistan, Australia, England, and South Africa.As Watson highlighted, the Champions Trophy is poised to reignite the excitement of international cricket in Pakistan .

Both players, battling injuries, batted for over 42 overs to ensure India secured an unforgettable draw.The result set the stage for their historic series win at the Gabba.
