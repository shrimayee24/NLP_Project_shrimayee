Day of the Jackal

There are a number of reasons. After “Lady Doctors” did quite well, I received several offers to write about the first women lawmakers, engineers, lawyers and so on. But I didn’t want to be boxed in as a writer only covering forgotten women. I wanted to do something completely different in tone and subject.While exploring ideas, I came across the story of Virendranath Chattopadhyay, brother of Sarojini Naidu. Unlike Sarojini, who followed the Gandhian path, Virendranath was a revolutionary and anarchist, pursued by the British Secret Service across Europe. He lived in the UK, France, Berlin, Sweden, and finally the Soviet Union, where he was executed during Stalin’s Great Purge.I also discovered his rival, MN Roy, better known in West Bengal as a co-founder of Indian communism. He too had a dramatic life—pursued by intelligence agencies, becoming a protégé of Lenin, and escaping Soviet Russia just before Virendranath’s execution.Though there are scholarly works on both men, I realised no popular history combined their stories. So I set out to do just that—write an accessible, engaging book for the ordinary reader rather than an academic audience.That’s where it all began.I can’t take much credit for this—it wasn’t really investigative journalism. Scholars have long written about Chatto, and I acknowledge their work in my book. It’s not a secret, though perhaps not widely known in India beyond academic circles. There’s also been discussion on social media—long tweet threads, for instance—and that’s probably where I first came across the idea.What I realised, however, is that while his story is known in scholarly circles, we lack accessible popular histories of such figures. In India, when we talk about revolutionaries, most people know Bose or Bhagat Singh, but not others like Chatto, who were largely erased or forgotten.From there, most of my research happened at the British Library in London, where I’m fortunate to have access. I found valuable material on both men—particularly Roy, who wrote prolifically and left behind books and letters that gave me another important source.My own background of moving around a lot drew me to stories of people who lived across borders, and both Chatto and Roy were true cosmopolitans and internationalists. They spoke multiple languages—Chatto knew 14 or 15—and moved in circles with figures like Lenin, Stalin, Sun Yat-sen, Rosa Luxemburg, Lala Lajpat Rai, Gandhi and Nehru. That immediately fascinated me.As for why they were overlooked, there are several reasons. First, Chatto’s execution in Stalin’s Great Purge in 1937 was concealed for decades; his fate only came to light in 1991 when the KGB archives were opened. Even his family thought he had simply died. Second, both men lived abroad and wrote largely in foreign languages, so their work was inaccessible to most Indians. Third, they clashed with Gandhi, Nehru, and even Sarojini Naidu—Chatto once called his sister a puppet of Gandhi and Nehru—so naturally they were pushed to the margins.Ultimately, both were brilliant but uncompromising, and I describe them as “magnificent failures.” They achieved a great deal, but their refusal to play the political game ensured they were sidelined from mainstream Indian history.This book was a huge challenge because of its vast scope—three main countries, but also Mexico, Germany, France, Sweden and others. I don’t think I’ve entirely succeeded in capturing everything, simply because there were too many strands. My aim was not to include every single thing Chatto or Roy said, or every major character they encountered—otherwise the book would become unreadable. I kept it to under 300 pages and focused instead on conveying their human side.For me, this book is about what it is to be human: to try, to fail, to try again, to make mistakes, to have toxic relationships and repeat them, to struggle and still keep going. That was the essence I wanted to bring out in Chatto and Roy.I was especially glad about a review by Vappala Balachandran. As a former officer of the Indian secret service, he had known some of these figures personally, like ACN Nambiar. He wrote that the book captured both the tragic plight of Chatto—trapped and eventually executed by Stalin—and the humanity of these two men. That meant a lot to me, because my goal was not to overload the reader with detail, but to make these complex lives accessible and deeply human.Honestly, I don’t quite know how I managed. I worked with index cards and structured the book so that one chapter focused on Chatto and the next on Roy. That back-and-forth was intentional—I wanted readers to see what each was doing at opposite ends of the world. The chapters aren’t strictly chronological either; I begin each one with an anecdote to hook the reader before moving into the narrative.It was difficult to keep track of so many strands, and in hindsight I think the book could have used aor a timeline. I may add that in the next edition. But by the time you finish a book, you’re so exhausted you just want to hand it over to the publisher.This was also a huge project written on a very tight deadline—about 15 months. I know some factual slips and typos crept in, which I hope to correct in the next edition. It really was a challenging endeavour, and I’m not sure one ever feels fully satisfied.I hope so. I mean, the book is still sort of, you know, having reviews and finding its feet. And one thing I'm noticing is that I think it's mostly men who are reading this book, which I have no objection to, but it's a change from Lady Doctors, which I think mostly women read.A. I’m not sure, but a lot of dads are reading this book. Some call it a dad book and say they’ll give it to their fathers. I intended it for everyone, but many readers tell me their dads would love it. That’s fine—I have no issues with dads or anyone else reading it.I am obsessed with crime fiction. Most of what I read is crime fiction. But this book was influenced mostly by journalism, because I tried to make it very readable and simple. There is a lot of communist philosophy in Roy’s life, but I did not want this to be a book about philosophy.Every chapter starts with an anecdote, and then I go on to the factual things like where they were born or what they did. Anecdotes make popular history readable. My past in journalism influenced that, because in journalism you always need interesting anecdotes and quotes. Roy had many, as did others around him. For example, when he founded the Mexican Communist Party, which is unusual since he was an Indian, an observer wrote there were “six men and a calico cat. ” Quotes like these convey whole relationships.Crime fiction influenced the pacing. With history, you need to keep it fast and snappy, or the reader will stop. So, I avoided long philosophy, endless dates, or proceedings of the Communist International. That’s why I began the book with Chatto’s execution. A review of the book said I borrowed this opening from. I found this criticism odd because I haven’t copied anybody; I was just writing it as it was. I didn’t realise the similarity, since those are novels and mine is history.","Virendranath Chattopadhyay, brother of Sarojini Naidu, was executed during Stalin’s Great Purge in 1937.

Najee Harris returns from eye injury as Chargers prepare for season opener in Brazil



Najee Harris outlook for 2025 and beyond



The Los Angeles Chargers received a major boost ahead of the 2025 NFL season. Running back Najee Harris, who suffered an eye injury during a Fourth of July fireworks mishap, has been activated from the Non-Football Injury/Illness (NFI) list. After missing training camp and the preseason, Harris practiced for the first time this week, giving the Chargers hope he could suit up when they open their season against the Kansas City Chiefs in São Paulo, Brazil, on September 5.Najee Harris’ road back has been carefully managed by the Chargers. His agent initially called the injury “superficial,” though the team kept details private. During his recovery, Harris gradually increased his workload—starting with walking laps in early August, moving to light drills with trainers by mid-month, and finally participating in individual practice sessions this week.General manager Joe Hortiz hinted during the preseason finale that Harris was “on track” for Week One, and Coach Jim Harbaugh confirmed that the running back remains a “possibility” to play. If Harris is available, it would extend his streak of never missing an NFL game, an impressive feat for a physical back who has logged over 1,000 rushing yards in each of his first four seasons.While Harris’ absence opened the door for rookie Omarion Hampton to claim first-team reps in camp, the Chargers had always envisioned a backfield timeshare.Offensive coordinator Greg Roman favors a balanced rushing attack, and Harris’ return creates the potential for a dynamic one-two punch. If Harris can take the field in Brazil, Los Angeles would debut a versatile backfield capable of complementing Justin Herbert’s passing game.The Chargers signed Harris not only for his production but for his reliability. He never missed a game during his four years with the Pittsburgh Steelers and consistently brought power running to the backfield. That durability was a missing piece for Los Angeles, whose ground game lagged well below league averages in 2024 despite an 11–6 playoff season.Now, with Hampton adding explosiveness and Harris providing steadiness, the Chargers could finally solve their rushing struggles. The team hasn’t had a 1,000-yard rusher in nearly a decade, but Harris’ track record suggests that could change. Harbaugh’s plan to manage his workload also ensures the veteran won’t be overused as he was in Pittsburgh.If Harris plays in Brazil, it will mark the beginning of a new chapter for both him and the Chargers. The pairing of Harris and Hampton has the potential to elevate the offense from good to elite—something the franchise has been chasing for years.Also Read: Selena Gomez reacts with sweetest message to best friend Taylor Swift’s engagement with Travis Kelce","Los Angeles Chargers running back Najee Harris has been activated from the Non- Football Injury/Illness (NFI) list.

Why the gesture mattered more than a photo

How the timing amplifies Josh Allen’s marketability and team momentum



An ordinary afternoon at Fan Expo Canada turned into a viral moment when Hailee Steinfeld — actress and wife of Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen — stopped to acknowledge a fan wearing a No. 17 Allen jersey. Rather than a quick selfie, Steinfeld joined the fan in forming a heart with their hands, a small gesture that instantly captured the internet’s attention and offered a warm reminder of how sports and Hollywood increasingly overlap.In an era of staged meet-and-greets and promotional appearances, Steinfeld’s spontaneous reaction felt genuine.

Tom Brady balances Fox Sports job and Las Vegas Raiders ownership

Tom Brady will be back in the broadcast booth this season with fewer restrictions from the NFL. On Wednesday, August 28, 2025, the league announced that Brady, who is both Fox Sports’ lead game analyst and a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, will now be allowed to join production meetings with coaches and players. Last year, during his first season as an analyst, Brady was banned from these meetings because of conflict-of-interest concerns. The NFL has now lifted that ban, but he will still not be allowed to attend team practices.Tom Brady, 47, reacted quickly to the news on his Instagram story. He reposted a Bleacher Report update and added a lighthearted message of his own:he wrote, tagging Kevin Burkhardt, Erin Andrews, and NFL on Fox.Tom Brady signed a 10-year, $375 million contract with Fox Sports in 2023, right after retiring from the NFL in 2022. He joined play-by-play announcer Kevin Burkhardt and sideline reporter Erin Andrews in the booth.But once NFL owners approved his 17-month process of buying a minority stake in the Raiders, the league created strict rules to avoid a conflict. In 2024, Brady was not allowed to sit in on almost any production meeting with teams, except during the Super Bowl.Now the NFL has eased those rules before the 2025 season, which starts on September 7 when Brady and the Fox crew will cover the New York Giants vs. Washington Commanders game.Also Read: Taylor Swift Vs Cristiano Ronaldo: Whose Engagement Ring Has Higher Value While the league has allowed Tom Brady more freedom as an analyst, some restrictions will remain in place.

Matthew Knies comments on William Nylander spark debate



Balancing the Leafs’ top line without weakening the second line



The Toronto Maple Leafs are heading into training camp with one of the biggest questions of the offseason: who will join Auston Matthews and Matthew Knies on the team’s top line? While many insiders see newcomer Matias Maccelli as the early favorite, Knies sparked debate over the weekend by subtly suggesting William Nylander as his preferred choice. His remarks, though casual, may have raised eyebrows within the organization.At a meet-and-greet event partnered with Tylenol, Knies hinted that he would like to skate alongside Matthews and Nylander to open the season. On paper, the idea makes sense. Nylander has a proven track record of chemistry with Matthews, and he also logged nearly 60 even-strength minutes with Knies last year. The trio could easily become one of the most dangerous first lines in the league.However, the optics of Knies lobbying for a linemate are less straightforward. At just 22 years old and entering his third NHL season, Knies hasn’t fully cemented himself as a voice in lineup decisions. His outspoken nature isn’t new—he has previously called out teammates, including himself, when effort levels dipped—but this instance feels different. Suggesting who should play alongside him can be viewed as stepping into territory usually reserved for the coaching staff.Head coach Craig Berube will ultimately decide, and Knies may need to show he’s willing to adapt regardless of who fills that spot.If Berube were to grant Knies his wish, the Leafs would boast a premier top line, but it would come with complications. Shifting Nylander away would leave captain John Tavares with two new wingers. At 34, Tavares is still productive, yet forcing him to carry a heavier offensive and defensive load isn’t ideal for long-term success.That’s why GM Brad Treliving continues exploring options on the trade market to bolster the top six. Until then, Toronto has multiple internal candidates ready to audition beside Matthews and Knies in preseason. Nylander may be the obvious choice, but the Leafs’ challenge is building not just one elite line—but two balanced ones capable of surviving an 82-game grind.Also Read: Vancouver Canucks’ identity at crossroads as Quinn Hughes trade talk intensifies with Devils showing strong interest","Matthew Knies hinted that he would like to skate alongside Auston Matthews and William Nylander.

Derek Ryan confirms Edmonton exit, Leon Draisaitl responds

Looking back at Derek Ryan’s Oilers tenure

Edmonton Oilers star Leon Draisaitl delivered a heartfelt message to former teammate Derek Ryan, who officially bid farewell to Edmonton after four memorable seasons. Ryan’s departure marks the end of a steady tenure in the Oilers’ bottom-six, where his leadership and consistency left a lasting impression on teammates and fans alike.Ryan, 37, announced on Instagram that his contract with the Oilers had run its course, bringing his Edmonton stint to an end. With no fresh NHL deal in place, the veteran forward reflected on his journey, thanking Oilers supporters for embracing his family and celebrating the memories created in Alberta.“Edmonton, thank you for the best 4 years. My family and I will always cherish the city, the memories that we made there, and most importantly the relationships that we formed. We might be leaving, but those relationships will last forever,” Ryan wrote in his farewell post.The message drew an emotional response from fans and players, but it was Leon Draisaitl’s simple reply that captured attention. In German, the Oilers’ superstar commented, “Du bist unglaublich,” translating to “You are incredible.” The gesture reflected the bond shared between the two players, underscoring Ryan’s influence inside the locker room.Ryan’s exit comes at a crucial moment for the Edmonton Oilers, as NHL free agency 2025 sparks roster changes, contract updates, and speculation around veteran forwards. His farewell, alongside Leon Draisaitl’s heartfelt reply, highlights the deep bonds within Edmonton’s locker room.After signing a two-year free-agent deal in 2021 following spells with the Carolina Hurricanes and Calgary Flames, Ryan quickly earned trust as a reliable two-way center. He delivered back-to-back 20-plus point seasons, cementing his value as a depth forward.His role, however, diminished last season. Splitting time between the Oilers and AHL affiliate Bakersfield Condors, Ryan featured in just 36 NHL games, registering 11 points. Despite limited ice time, his professionalism, work ethic, and leadership remained invaluable in Edmonton’s playoff-chasing environment.With career milestones across multiple teams including the Edmonton Oilers, Carolina Hurricanes, and Calgary Flames, Ryan’s consistent performance, NHL depth forward contributions, playoff experience, and veteran leadership continue to attract attention from hockey analysts, fans, and media outlets.Also Read: Leon Draisaitl’s wife Celeste Desjardins gives fans a glimpse of Saint-Tropez fam-jam vacation with Connor McDavid’s wife Lauren Kyle Ryan’s next step in hockey is yet to be determined.

Michael Jordan wins $8.9 million lawsuit against Dominick’s in 2015

Michael Jordan donates the proceeds and supports Chicago children

Also Read:

Even after retiring from the NBA, Michael Jordan has remained a strong and determined figure. Off the court, he is just as careful about his rights as he was about his game. One story from 2015 shows how seriously he protects his personal identity. Jordan’s actions sent a clear message about defending personal rights and giving back to the community at the same time.The case began in Chicago, Illinois, where Michael Jordan, the Hall of Famer and six-time NBA champion, noticed his name was used without permission. The Chicago-based supermarket chain Dominick’s, a subsidiary of Safeway that later closed in 2013, ran an advertisement in 2011 featuring Jordan’s name to promote a meat sale in a Sports Illustrated special issue. Jordan’s legal team said the chain had no right to use his name.The supermarket first offered a settlement of about $126,900, but Michael Jordan’s lawyers argued that the sum should match the real advertising value of his name. After the court reviewed the case, Jordan won $8.9 million. ESPN reported his comments after the verdict, saying,“No one, whether or not they’re a public figure, should have to worry about their identity being used without their permission.”Jordan added, “I hope this case sends a clear message…that I will continue to be vigilant about protecting my name and identity.”He further added:""The case was not about the money, as I plan to donate the proceeds to charity. It was about honesty and integrity.... I also hope the size of the monetary reward will deter others from using someone else's identity and believing they will only pay a small penalty.""Michael Jordan made it clear that the lawsuit was not about money. Instead, it was about integrity, honesty, and defending his personal rights. He pledged to donate the full $8.9 million to 23 charities in Chicago that support children’s health, education, and well-being. In a news release shared with ABA Journal, Jordan said, “Chicago has given me so much, and I want to give back to its kids, the city’s future.”Jordan, now 62, is not only a legendary basketball player but also a cultural icon who uses his platform to make a difference. The Dominick’s case shows how he defends his rights and uses victories to help others.His careful attention to personal identity also comes amid other legal challenges, such as his 2015 lawsuit in China against Qiaodan Sports, which uses his name and number 23 without permission. This story originally appeared on ESPN and ABA Journal and highlights Michael Jordan’s commitment to personal rights, community support, and integrity both on and off the courtMichael Jordan recently donated $10 million to open his fourth free health clinic in Wilmington, further improving access to healthcare in the surrounding community.","Michael Jordan won $8.9 million lawsuit against supermarket chain Dominick's in 2015.

University of Bristol research shows NHL far ahead of NBA in ad frequency



The NHL's Gambling Problem : A Deep Dive

Sports betting promotions could face tighter rules in the coming seasons



The NHL is facing fresh scrutiny after new research highlighted the overwhelming presence of gambling promotions during this year’s Stanley Cup finals. Fans tuning in were hit with near-constant exposure to betting companies, sparking debate over whether hockey has allowed gambling to take too central a role in its broadcasts.The University of Bristol analyzed advertising during the six-game championship series between the Florida Panthers and the Edmonton Oilers. The findings were striking: on average, gambling-related logos, commercials, or rinkside ads appeared 3.5 times per minute.In the most saturated game, that figure rose to 4.7 times per minute; the equivalent of one ad every 13 seconds. This level of visibility is far higher than many expected. And illustrates how deeply betting partnerships have become woven into NHL coverage.For fans, it meant that gambling brands were nearly impossible to ignore, as from jersey patches to on-screen graphics, promotions were layered into nearly every aspect of the broadcast.The same study compared the NHL finals with the NBA finals, where the Indiana Pacers faced the Oklahoma City Thunder. Across all 13 championship games between the two leagues.And researchers recorded 6,282 instances of gambling-related marketing.Notably, 94 percent of those instances occurred during NHL broadcasts, while the NBA averaged just 0.26 gambling mentions per minute; the NHL averaged 3.5. And a gap that underscores how heavily hockey relies on betting promotions compared to basketball.Researchers suggested this disparity might be tied to platform choices. The NBA has leaned more on outlets like YouTube, which enforces stricter rules on gambling advertising, while the NHL’s traditional broadcast approach leaves more room for ad saturation.The findings add weight to calls for tighter regulation of sports gambling promotions. Comparisons have already been made to past restrictions on alcohol and tobacco sponsorships in professional sports.While gambling has become a major revenue source for the NHL and its broadcast partners, concerns are growing. That too about the impact on younger viewers and vulnerable audiences, as the study suggests that the current advertising pace is unsustainable and could push regulators to step in.For now, fans may have to get used to the constant betting messages, but with public concern rising and research shining a light on the issue. The league could eventually be forced to scale back its reliance on gambling visibility.Also Read: NHL Trade News: Why Steve Yzerman’s trade of Jake Walman still puzzles Red Wings fans","University of Bristol research shows NHL far ahead of NBA in ad frequency of gambling promotions.

Rashee Rice suspended six games by NFL after personal conduct policy violation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/rashee-rice-suspended-six-games-by-nfl-after-personal-conduct-policy-violation/articleshow/123549102.cms,"Rashee Rice suspension: NFL rules Chiefs WR out first six games of 2025.

NFL hands down six-game suspension for Rashee Rice



The legal troubles behind the NFL’s decision



The Kansas City Chiefs are starting the new NFL season with some major drama off the field. Wide receiver Rashee Rice, who was expected to be a huge part of Patrick Mahomes ’ passing game, won’t be suiting up anytime soon. The NFL has officially suspended Rice for six games under its personal conduct policy, a decision that follows months of speculation and back-and-forth about how harsh the punishment would be.According to ESPN and NFL Network, Rice agreed to a six-game ban that kicks in Week 1 of the 2025 season, when the Chiefs open in Brazil. He’ll be eligible to return in Week 7, giving Kansas City half a season without one of their top young offensive weapons.The league originally wanted something closer to a double-digit suspension, but a negotiated settlement with the NFL Players Association landed at six games. It’s a huge storyline heading into the new year, with the NFL balancing discipline and the Chiefs trying to defend their dynasty.The suspension stems from Rice’s role in a chain-reaction crash in Dallas back in March 2024. He pleaded guilty to two third-degree felonies in July, which resulted in a sentence of 30 days in jail, five years of probation, and more than $115,000 in restitution to the victims.While the jail time can be served during his probation, the NFL moved forward with discipline under its personal conduct policy. The ruling makes it clear that Rice’s off-field choices are now impacting his football future.For Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs, the loss of Rice is no small thing. After a breakout rookie season, he was expected to be the No. 1 wideout in Kansas City’s retooled offense. Instead, Patrick Mahomes will have to lean more heavily on Hollywood Brown, rookie speedster Xavier Worthy, and veterans like Skyy Moore and Justin Watson.The NFL schedule doesn’t make things easy either Kansas City opens with the Chargers in Brazil and faces a tough stretch in September. Without Rice, every game suddenly feels more complicated for Andy Reid’s offense.For Rashee Rice, this will be the ultimate test. Does he learn from this and come back stronger, or does this setback derail a career that was just starting to take off?Also read - Travis Kelce’s Net Worth in 2025: NFL Salary, Endorsements, and Business Ventures","NFL hands down six-game suspension for Rashee Rice under its personal conduct policy.

Jerry Jones on Micah Parsons trade and Dallas Cowboys future



Dallas Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons, 26, has formally asked for a trade. Citing team concerns and contract negotiating problems, he told the team on August 1, 2025, that he wanted to quit Dallas. Seeking a fresh contract worth nearly $200 million, Parsons has developed into one of the best defensive stars in the NFL beginning in 2021. His trade request has sparked rumors about which team could land him next, with the Green Bay Packers emerging as a possible destination.In the midst of trade rumors, the Green Bay Packers have reportedly made a tremendous offer to the Cowboys.Per reports, they're willing to trade two first-round picks, a third-round pick, and their top pass rusher, Rashan Gary for Parsons. Gary was drafted in 2019 and has 32 sacks and 77 quarterback hits in his last 59 games, which means he is a valuable asset.This trade proposal is an attempt to fill the Packers’ need for leverage on defense while giving the Cowboys picks and a certified pass-rusher.However, it should be stated that these are speculative, based on rumors, and neither organization has made an official statement that is ‘for’ or ‘against’ the trade.Regarding Parsons' future with the squad, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has been unequivocal. Jones has said that the team won't trade Parsons and has confidence in keeping him, even in light of the trade rumors.He thinks the ongoing contract talks are just part of the business side of football, hence he anticipates Parsons staying with the Cowboys.Though the Green Bay Packers' offer is significant, it remains unclear whether the Cowboys would think about trading their star linebacker. The scenario remains fluid.

“getting traded,”

Flames captain Mikael Backlund signals Rasmus Andersson’s likely trade departure amid NHL rumors

Calgary Flames defensive outlook and Rasmus Andersson NHL trade market interest

The Calgary Flames are once again in the center of NHL trade chatter, with defenseman Rasmus Andersson’s future becoming increasingly uncertain. Flames captain Mikael Backlund made waves during the NHL’s European Media Tour by suggesting Andersson ispointing to a clear divide between the player and the team. With free agency looming and contract talks stalled, the Flames face another potential major shake-up on the blue line.Backlund, a 17-year Flames veteran and longtime leader, told Michael Russo of The Athletic that Andersson doesn’t want to become a distraction and may be nearing the end of his tenure in Calgary. The defenseman is entering the final year of his contract with a $4.55 million cap hit, but negotiations on an extension have reportedly stalled. Andersson is believed to be seeking a significant raise, while Calgary is holding firm on a value-focused offer.The captain’s remarks carry extra weight given his deep ties to the organization, having played over 1,000 games in Calgary. Andersson, meanwhile, has been a cornerstone of the Flames’ defense, logging top-pair minutes and producing steady offense from the blue line. He recorded 11 goals and 31 points last season, though that marked a dip from his back-to-back 49- and 50-point campaigns earlier in his career.Andersson has been at the center of speculation since Calgary’s defensive overhaul in recent seasons.General manager Craig Conroy moved on from Chris Tanev, Nikita Zadorov, and Noah Hanifin, leaving Andersson as the lone long-term piece on the back end alongside MacKenzie Weegar and Kevin Bahl.

Ban lifted, Brady gets full access behind-the-scenes

Balancing dual roles in the NFL spotlight

Fans set for elevated broadcast experience

Brady’s unique perspective shines in the booth

Balancing fame, responsibility, and football expertise

Tom Brady, the NFL icon turned Fox Sports broadcaster, is stepping into his second season in the booth with renewed access and cautious optimism. Fresh off a rookie broadcasting season that included the Super Bowl, Brady is now navigating a landscape shaped by his dual roles as analyst and minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders. With the NFL lifting some of the restrictions that limited his preparation last year, the 46-year-old legend is poised to bring deeper insights to fans while carefully balancing the fine line between ownership and commentary.Last season, Brady’s broadcasting debut came with a notable limitation: he was barred from attending production meetings with NFL coaches and teams due to his minority stake in the Raiders. This restriction, imposed to prevent conflicts of interest, forced Brady to rely on secondary sources for game insights—a challenge for someone known for dissecting every play on the field. According to Andrew Marchand of The Athletic, the NFL has now rescinded that ban, allowing Brady to participate fully in production meetings for the 2025 season.While the lifted restriction offers Brady unprecedented preparation access, certain limits remain.He still cannot attend team practices or publicly critique officials and opposing teams—measures designed to preserve league integrity. “It’s about maintaining the credibility of both roles,” a league insider explained. Brady’s ability to straddle the line between minority owner and analyst is under close scrutiny, and industry experts suggest this balancing act could redefine how former players transition into media roles.Brady’s first assignment for the 2025 season will be a Week 1 matchup between the Washington Commanders and the New York Giants. Despite restrictions last season, Brady impressed viewers with sharp, insightful commentary. With expanded access to production meetings, fans can now expect richer, more detailed analysis, insider observations, and nuanced breakdowns that few broadcasters can provide.Brady’s journey from the gridiron to the broadcast booth underscores a larger trend: elite athletes shaping sports media with insider knowledge. “Being in the booth gives me a different perspective on the game,” Brady said in a recent interview. “I’m excited to dig deeper this season and provide fans with insights they wouldn’t get anywhere else.” The combination of experience, credibility, and access positions Brady to offer a uniquely compelling broadcast experience.As Brady navigates this unique position, fans and critics alike are intrigued by how he will manage ownership duties while maintaining impartiality as a broadcaster. His expanded access is not just a win for him but for viewers, who gain commentary enriched by firsthand preparation and exclusive insights. It’s a rare chance to watch one of football’s greatest minds translate in-game mastery into articulate, engaging storytelling for a national audience.Also read: Travis Kelce’s locker room stunned and electrified as Taylor Swift turns up for Kansas City Chiefs’ Week 3 clash against Chicago Bears",The NFL has lifted restrictions on Tom Brady's access to production meetings.

Auston Matthews aims to lead Team USA to glory



Hockey fans are in for a spectacle when Connor McDavid and the Edmonton Oilers host Auston Matthews’ Toronto Maple Leafs on February 3, 2026. The showdown at Rogers Place isn’t just about two of the NHL ’s biggest superstars colliding—it will also mark a special Olympic send-off celebration, making the night one of the most anticipated dates on the 2025-26 calendar.The Oilers confirmed that their clash with Toronto will double as an Olympic send-off night—the final home game before McDavid and his teammates head to Milano for the 2026 Winter Games. Edmonton has planned 16 themed nights across the season, but this one stands apart given the weight of both the NHL rivalry and the Olympic narrative.For McDavid, who has already been confirmed for Team Canada, this game will carry extra significance. Hockey Canada has announced its orientation camp in Calgary from August 26–28, and alongside McDavid, the likes of Sidney Crosby, Nathan MacKinnon, Sam Reinhart, Cale Makar, and Brayden Point have also secured their places on the roster. With such names leading the charge, expectations for Canada’s Olympic campaign are soaring.While McDavid will be at the heart of Canada’s ambitions, Auston Matthews is preparing for his own historic opportunity.The Leafs’ captain is expected to wear the ‘C’ for Team USA, who are still chasing their first gold medal since the legendary “Miracle on Ice” in 1980. Matthews has already been named among the six confirmed players for the American squad, alongside Matthew Tkachuk, Quinn Hughes, Jack Eichel, Brady Tkachuk, and Charlie McAvoy.Though Matthew Tkachuk is recovering from surgery, he is expected to be available by February, adding another layer of firepower to a roster desperate to end decades of Olympic heartbreak.With McDavid and Matthews set to collide in Edmonton just before taking their rivalry onto the Olympic stage, February 3 promises more than just a regular-season clash.

As the calendar turned a year from the heartbreaking crash that claimed the lives of two hockey legends, Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau, the global hockey league remembered their deepest contributions, its deep affection, and reverence for the beloved brothers and the values they embodied.Last year, on August 29, 2024, the hockey world was stunned and hearts broke when Columbus Blue Jackets star Johnny Gaudreau, aged 31, and his brother Matthew Gaudreau, 29, were killed in a tragic accident. It all happened on the wedding eve of their sister Katie's wedding. Let’s take a look at the horrific incident that claimed the lives of two brothers from the hockey industry.It’s been a year since Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau ’s passing. According to ABC News, Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau were killed when they were riding bikes on a rural road in Oldmans Township, New Jersey, on the eve of their sister's wedding, when they were struck by a driver suspected of being under the influence of alcohol, according to police.However, nearly a year later, the memory of Johnny and Matthew continues to shine brightly, sustained by the love of their families, the hockey community, and the meaningful initiatives forged in their honor. As per reports, Friday marks the anniversary of the unthinkable tragedy that rocked the hockey world.Out of a heartbreaking tragedy, the widows came together to establish the John and Matthew Gaudreau Foundation in early 2025. The purpose of the organization is to create opportunities for youth hockey, support families grappling with loss, and assist those impacted by drunk driving.What started as an idea during the funeral has blossomed into a heartfelt tribute to their generous spirits.The wider hockey community has also stepped up to honor the brothers’ legacies. USA Hockey announced that national teams will don helmet decals featuring their names and jersey numbers, 13 for Johnny and 21 for Matthew, encircled by hockey sticks, a powerful symbol of lasting respect and remembrance.Tributes have taken place in numerous rinks, in Calgary and Columbus, where Johnny shone for 11 NHL seasons. Meanwhile, at Boston College, where the Gaudreau brothers played together, in Dubuque, Iowa, and Omaha, Nebraska, their stops in the USHL, and back home in Sewell, New Jersey, where the Hollydell Ice Arena has renamed one of its rinks in their honor.The influence of this remembrance has gone beyond just ceremonies. Cole Caufield of the Montreal Canadiens changed his jersey to Johnny’s No. 13, calling it a personal tribute to his “hero.”Again, in Columbus, Johnny’s close friend Sean Monahan and defenseman Zach Werenski paid their respects with tributes on their sticks. Werenski’s design cleverly fused his No. 8 with Johnny’s 13—creating a haloed figure with angel wings, a subtle yet powerful homage to his fallen teammate.","It’s been a year since Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau ’s passing.

Golden State Warriors relentless pursuit of LeBron James falls flat

Golden State Warriors struggle to go through financial hurdles of a LeBron James trade

The offseason tension has hit a solid pause. The Golden State Warriors have been after LeBron James and have contacted the Los Angeles Lakers ""multiple times"" over the past 18 months but the Lakers have clearly put an end to any trade discussions. LeBron James ’ enormous $52.6 million player option, his no-trade clause, and the Lakers' strategic move towards Luka Doncic have made this deal almost unfeasible. This standoff signifies a major shift in a possible blockbuster narrative that may never come to be.In the last year and a half, the Golden State Warriors have been looking into a big trade for LeBron James, hoping to team him up with Stephen Curry for a shot at a fifth championship, as reported by NBA insider Jake Fischer.They kept trying, even leading up to the 2024 trade deadline, but every time they were turned down. Lakers owner Jeanie Buss passed the discussions to James’ agent Rich Paul, who confirmed that LeBron wasn’t interested in moving away from Los Angeles.The Los Angeles Lakers have zero interest in the trade packages proposed by the Golden State Warriors. Reports show they aren't even thinking about offers that involve Jimmy Butler or Jonathan Kuminga.The logistical challenges are significant, and with James earning $52.6 million next season, it creates a salary matching problem. Additionally, any multi-player trade could incur serious luxury tax penalties under the existing cap framework.The NBA insider Sam Quinn has said in an interview with CBS sports that the LeBron James trade is off the table for now. He said, “So for the time being, a James-to-Golden State trade is probably off of the table. But Fischer's reporting was an important reminder that we do know of at least one team that is probably still interested in James. That team is comfortable pursuing him during the season, as it has made overtures at the last two trade deadlines. So even if a trade doesn't make sense at this very moment, there's a team worth monitoring as the offseason progresses and the regular season potentially begins”.The Los Angeles Lakers are going through one of the most ambitious rebuilds in recent NBA history. With Luka Doncic now at the heart of their long-term strategy—supported by a three-year, $165 million contract, they're gearing up to stay competitive in the present while also keeping future options available.LeBron James has chosen his $52.6 million player option for 2025–26 and, through Paul, highlighted that his focus is still on winning a championship albeit within a Los Angeles setup that is clearly adapting to center around Luka Doncic.For the Golden State Warriors, the potential route seems promising in theory but is practically blocked. While the chemistry between Curry and James during the Olympics raised some hopes, the truth about salary cap rules, team balance, and the Lakers’ solid resistance makes a trade seem improbable at least for now.Also Read: The Los Angeles Lakers are quietly plotting the most aggressive roster change of the modern NBA era The buzz about a LeBron-to-Warriors partnership has officially died down—met with strategic resistance at every corner. The Warriors' continuous attempts have hit a wall with LeBron's contract power and the Lakers' solid strategic shift focusing on Luka Doncic. Unless LeBron himself asks for a trade and specifically calls out Golden State Warriors, this tale is definitely on hold. As both franchises take different paths, the hope of Stephen Curry and LeBron James sharing a jersey remains exciting but is becoming more remote.","Golden State Warriors' pursuit of LeBron James falls flat.

How a September start could reshape the regular season

NHL Update From Europe | 32 Thoughts

NHL Could Start Regular Season in September with 84-Game Schedule | OutKick

How ending earlier betters players and fans

The NHL is considering scheduling changes for the 2026-27 season as the NCAA is slated to hold an 84-game season, and the NCAA is considering starting the season in September, ahead of the usual start in October. This change would be in line with the new CBA and would shorten training camps as well as the preseason. This change in schedule would be in line with the new collective bargaining agreement and would shorten training camps and the preseason. The changes could have a ripple effect on the playoff scheduling, and the playoffs could potentially be concluded earlier in June instead of dragging into the later months.With this change, the NHL will have to face scrutiny from different sides. With a September start, the league would be able to extend the regular season, which would be able to give the players more recovery time between games. This would decrease the fatigue, possibly reduce injuries, and keep the stars fresher for the games in the later stages of the season.With the increase in player wellness, the perks offered to players are highly effective during the early stages of the season. The Disadvantage to this, particularly if the finishing date of the cups is not changed, the season would end at an inconveniently late date in June.The other proposal is to keep the program as it is, for an earlier conclusion to the cups.Summer recovery is priceless for postseason athletes in particular. Starting in September, with a tightened schedule, shortens the season and enables players to finish in early June, thereby drastically increasing the amount of rest they can take. This rest also enables fans to recuperate, as hockey in late June is perpetually overshadowed by other sports as well as summer leisure activities. Excessively long preseason exhibition games are a waste of time, and condensing them saves time as well as delivers early, meaningful hockey.Also Read: Josh Morrissey earns top-10 defenseman ranking in EA Sports NHL 26 The change to an 84-game season might be the most daring decision, but a well-managed schedule will be the only way to make it a success. Beginning in September has an alluring outlook, but the best outcome is a season’s alignment that allows players to have a longer rest period and fans to have an exciting and well-timed conclusion. Hockey is best enjoyed during shorter seasons with greater intensity; therefore, this change could be the least response to the imbalance that exists in the NHL calendar.","The NHL is considering scheduling changes for the 2026-27 season as the NCAA is slated to hold an 84-game season.

And none other than Ranadive was there to see him perform exceptionally with his own eyes.During the recent Germany vs. Montenegro game at the EuroBasket competition, Schroder scored 21 points and 4 assists for his team, leading them to a 106-76 victory. And Ranadive was all too happy to see his newest recruit perform so brilliantly, who was named the MVP during the 2023 FIBA World Cup. But some critics still have some doubts about his performance in the league, and it will be up to the player to show them why he belongs in the league.While Dennis Schroder is like a beast in national competitions and always shows up for Germany, the same cannot be said for when he is playing in the NBA. Schroder's journey in the league has been full of ups and downs, and although his caliber as a player cannot be denied, it also cannot be refuted that he is not the most consistent.Before joining the Sacramento Kings , Schroder was with the Detroit Pistons for a short while, and he only managed to average 10.8 points during his stay there. Kings fans would hope for a better performance from the point guard in the upcoming season, where he will team up with the likes of Domantas Sabonis and DeMar DeRozan. During the 2024-25 season, the Kings finished 9th during the regular season, and lost to the Dallas Mavericks during the Play-in tournament, ending their season early. Hopefully, things can change in the upcoming season, especially with the addition of Schroder to the team.Also Read: ""It felt like before a finals game"": LeBron James opened up about the nerve-wracking moment he proposed to Savannah James","The Sacramento Kings signed point guard Dennis Schroder on July 7 from the Detroit Pistons in a sign-and-trade deal.

It was a humid, muggy day. Not exactly the conditions for highly competitive, elite-level squash matches inside glass-door courts. But India’s top squash stars fought hard and gave some memorable performances in the semifinals of the 81st National Squash Championships 2025 at the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium here on Tuesday.The thrill-a-minute match of the day was between two best friends, Abhay Singh and Ramit Tandon, who played the first men’s singles semifinal.Top seed Abhay thrives on big moments. To watch him compete is to witness a blend of instinct, intelligence and resilience, all wrapped in a style that is uniquely his. What also makes his on-court presence compelling is his energy. The 26-year-old is expressive when he plays — pumping his fist, letting out shouts of intensity and feeding off the crowd when the rallies tighten.Abhay plays with a sense of belief and bravery, the willingness to back himself in the crucial points. He’s not afraid to extend rallies, work the opponent physically and then suddenly pounce when the opening appears. That spirit often lifts his performance, especially when the chips are down. And indeed he had to dig deep against Ramit. After losing the first set 11-13, a set which could have gone either way, Abhay had to bring to the fore every ounce of his reserve energy to eke out a 11-13, 11-5, 11-6, 11-7 win and enter the final.“Ramit is one of my best friends. We share rooms when we are on (PSA) tour. It was a really hard match mentally and he made me realise after the first game that if I have to win I would need to really dig deep. Happy to come back and turn around the first-game loss,” Abhay told TOI after the match.Abhay’s final opponent would be second seed Velavan Senthilkumar, who got the better of Veer Chotrani 7-11, 11-7, 11-2, 11-4 in the second semifinal.“It was a pretty long match. I had to be really focused and locked in today. Veer is an amazing player, really skilled, talented and one of the top prospects of Indian squash. I am glad that I could get the win,” Velavan said.In the women’s singles semis, top seed Anahat Singh’s match against fellow Delhi girl Tanvi Khanna was a tale of two halves. In the first, Anahat was completely off-colour and it looked like Tanvi would coast to an easy win. The second half, however, saw Anahat raise the level of her game, often creating tough angles for Tanvi with her drop shots and tight volleys. In the end, Anahat won 3-11, 11-5, 11-0, 11-9.Anahat will face second seed Akanksha Salunkhe, who got the better of Joshna Chinappa 11-5, 13-11, 7-11, 12-10.","Top seed Abhay thrives on big moments.

The Champions League draw for the 36-team league phase will take place in Monaco on Thursday, with defending champions Paris Saint-Germain looking to retain their title after their historic 5-0 victory over Inter Milan in last season's final in Munich. The new format, introduced last season, replaced the traditional group stage with a single league where teams play eight different opponents.PSG finished 15th in the league phase before going on to win the tournament, defeating first-placed Liverpool on penalties in the last 16. They went on to become only the second French team to win the trophy after Marseille's 1993 triumph.""Last season we fulfilled the objective which everybody connected to the club had been dreaming about. But we want to keep on making history and now that would mean winning two Champions Leagues in a row. That is our objective. Last season nobody thought we were capable of winning it and we showed that we were. The dream is to win it again. We know it will be very difficult, but we are delighted to have that as a dream,"" said PSG coach Luis Enrique.PSG's victory ended a 20-year dominance by teams from England, Spain, Germany, and Italy.These four nations still maintain their strong presence with 19 of the 36 teams, including six English clubs thanks to Tottenham Hotspur's Europa League victory.The competition now features teams from only 16 countries out of UEFA's 55 member associations, with three teams coming from France.Only half of the teams in Thursday's draw participated in last season's league phase, bringing fresh faces to the competition.Kairat Almaty from Kazakhstan qualified by defeating Celtic in the play-offs, becoming only the second team from their country to reach the Champions League proper after Astana.Norwegian club Bodo/Glimt qualified for the first time, marking Norway's return to the competition since Rosenborg's appearance in 2007/08.Union Saint-Gilloise secured their first-ever Champions League qualification after winning their first Belgian title in 90 years.Cypriot champions Pafos, featuring former Chelsea and PSG defender David Luiz, also qualified for the first time.""We are the black sheep of the Champions League and the expectation is that we will suffer and lose games, but we will fight, compete and just enjoy the journey,"" said Pafos coach Juan Carlos Carcedo.While Liverpool's top finish in the league phase didn't lead to ultimate success, the next three teams - Barcelona, Arsenal, and Inter - all reached the semi-finals.The financial rewards for Champions League participation have reached new heights, with UEFA projecting total prize money of nearly 2.5 billion euros.Winners can earn over 100 million euros in prize money alone, with additional millions from television rights and coefficient ranking. PSG reportedly earned close to 150 million euros from their victory last season.The final will be played in Budapest, which lies 5,800km west of Almaty by land.The Champions League draw will take place on Thursday August 28, 2025. It will be held in Monaco.The Champions League draw will take place at 9:30pm IST (6pm CET/11pm ET/4pm GMT/5pm UK).Last year the entire draw and award ceremony took 75 minutes to complete so brace yourself as 36 teams get their place in the league phase draw.Each team will be drawn to play eight fixtures, facing two opponents from every pot.Teams from the same country cannot face each other, so Real Madrid cannot play Barcelona.There can be at most two matches against clubs from the same country.

Poll Do you believe Neeraj Chopra can win the Diamond League Finals again? Yes, definitely! Maybe, depends on conditions. No, he will struggle.

As Neeraj Chopra sat alongside American discus throw great Valarie Allman for a joint media interaction in Zurich on Wednesday afternoon, the Olympic and world champion javelin thrower was asked by the moderator about one big challenge he expects in his fourth Diamond League Finals appearance.“Rain and heavy crosswinds,” was Neeraj’s answer.Neeraj is set to return to Zurich’s Letzigrund Stadium on Thursday, hoping to lift the diamond trophy he won three years ago at the same venue. This achievement marked the first and only time the 27-year-old was crowned DL Finals champion. He finished as runner-up in the subsequent editions in 2023 (Eugene) and Brussels (2024). The winner will take home a handsome sum in prize money — $30,000 (Rs 25 lakh).Neeraj said the stakes are high with the prestigious World Athletics Championships in Tokyo approaching, where he is the defending champion.“The weather conditions don’t look good for tomorrow. There’s high chance of rain, coupled with strong windy conditions with the evening remaining mostly cloudy. You know, headwinds are brutal for javelin throwers. But the conditions would be the same for everyone. So, it will depend on how good you throw.You have to make good use of speed and technique. Tailwinds are good for us, not headwinds. I am hoping for the best. I must remain tough mentally,” Neeraj said.Neeraj will face stiff competition in a high-quality seven-man line-up featuring six of the world’s top-10 throwers. Reigning champion Grenada’s Anderson Peters, who edged out Neeraj by a single centimetre in Brussels last year, will be looking to defend his crown. Germany’s Julian Weber, who spoiled Neeraj’s party in the Doha DL meet by throwing 91.06m to claim the first spot, will be hoping for another big throw.In Doha, Neeraj had for the first time in his career breached the 90m mark by heaving the spear to a distance of 90.23m. Neeraj returned the favour to Weber in the Paris DL, coming out on top with a best effort of 88.16m. It was the first time this season that Neeraj had defeated the German, who had beaten him at the Doha and Poland DL meets.Others in the field include 2012 Olympic gold medallist Keshorn Walcott, former world champion Julius Yego and Moldova’s Andrian Mardare. Local favourite Simon Wieland is part of the field as the host nation’s entry.“Weber will present a tough competition. He has been consistent in his throws. If we look at the last two years, he is doing really well. The field is quite strong and I am expecting a good, competitive outing,” Neeraj added.This season, Neeraj competed in two DL meets, finishing second in Doha and winning in Paris. Overall, Neeraj has participated in six competitions this season, claiming victories in four and finishing as runner-up twice. He skipped the Silesia and Brussels legs of the DL after securing qualification for the Finals earlier.Neeraj said that he was still working on his technique with legendary coach Jan Zelezny of the Czech Republic.","Neeraj Chopra set to return to Zurich’s Letzigrund Stadium on Thursday.

AFC seeks factual report on ISL

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) is hoping the Supreme Court on Thursday will help break the impasse that has brought Indian football to a standstill, with a threat of FIFA suspension looming.The world governing body and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) jointly sent a letter to AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey on Tuesday expressing “profound concern” at the continued failure to finalise and implement the revised constitution, “a matter that has remained under consideration since proceedings before the Supreme Court of India in 2017.”Despite repeated assurances, the letter notes, “the absence of a clear and compliant governance framework has now created an untenable vacuum and legal uncertainties at the heart of Indian football.”FIFA has given AIFF a deadline of Oct 30 to secure a definitive order from the Supreme Court approving the revised AIFF constitution and then get it ratified by the general body. Failure to adhere to this schedule “may result in sanctions outlined in the FIFA and AFC Statutes, including the possibility of suspension.”AIFF has also been reminded of its “obligation to manage its affairs independently and without any undue third-party influence, including government bodies.”Should FIFA suspend India, it will be the second such ban in three years. The world body also suspended India on Aug 16, 2022, for third-party influence because a SC-appointed committee of administrators was running the federation. The ban was lifted 10 days later, paving the way for elections in which Kalyan Chaubey defeated former India captain Bhaichung Bhutia for the top post.Suspension means the national team will be barred from international tournaments — crucially the Asian Cup 2027 final-round qualifiers — while clubs like Mohun Bagan Super Giant and FC Goa will be scratched out midway into the group stages of the AFC Champions League Two, Asian football’s second-tier club competition.“At the last hearing in the Supreme Court, it was mentioned that the order (on the draft constitution) is ready, but it was not pronounced to ensure that it’s in sync with the recently-enacted National Sports Act. We are hoping it’s only a matter of time before the order is out,” said a senior official.Once the Supreme Court gives the order, the AIFF will ensure that it aligns with mandatory provisions of FIFA and AFC Statutes and regulations. According to sources, the federation is expected to convene a general body meeting to ratify the constitution on Oct 14, when India hosts Singapore in the AFC Asian Cup 2027 final-round qualifiers.In a letter to AIFF deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan, AFC general secretary Datuk Seri Windsor John has sought a factual report on the top-tier Indian Super League (ISL), clarifying the status of commercial negotiations with its marketing partners, the timeline of Supreme Court ruling, impact on affected clubs and stakeholders, and concrete measures being taken to resume the league and safeguard stability.The AFC has said the indefinite suspension of India’s top league is “deeply concerning.”","FIFA has given AIFF a deadline of Oct 30 to secure a definitive order from the Supreme Court approving the revised AIFF constitution.

Is Easton Cowan READY for the Next Step with the Maple Leafs?

Easton Cowan looks prepared to crack the Maple Leafs' lineup



Ben Danford and Noah Chadwick headline defensive prospects

Ben Danford | 2024-25 Highlights

Tyler Hopkins and Artur Akhtyamov add long-term potential

The Toronto Maple Leafs are looking ahead to the 2024-25 season. Along with optimism surrounding their top young players, all from forwards to defensemen and goaltenders. There are several prospects moving closer to NHL readiness. The focus is on Easton Cowan, who could break into the lineup this fall, while others continue their development paths across junior and professional hockey.Easton Cowan’s rise has been impressive since Toronto selected him with the 28th pick in the 2023 NHL Draft. Last season with the London of the Ontario Hockey League, he produced 69 points in 46 games. His standout play continued in the postseason, where he led all scorers with 39 points in 17 playoff games.Cowan’s efforts guided London to the Memorial Cup championship and earned him the tournament’s most valuable player award. At 20, he will enter Maple Leafs training camp with a legitimate shot at earning a roster spot. His skill, pace, and ability to perform under pressure have made him the centerpiece of Toronto’s prospect group.Ben Danford, taken with the 31st pick in the 2024 Draft, is building his reputation as a steady and physical defenseman.Playing with Oshawa of the OHL, the 19-year-old contributed 25 points last season while wearing the captain’s “C.” His leadership qualities and skating ability have already caught the attention of Toronto’s development staff.Noah Chadwick, a sixth-round pick from 2023, has emerged as another promising option on the blue line. The 6-foot-4 defenseman captained Lethbridge in the Western Hockey League and finished with 53 points in 66 games. While his skating continues to improve, his size and presence make him an intriguing long-term project for the Maple Leafs.Among forwards, Tyler Hopkins is one of the more recent additions. The Maple Leafs picked him in the third round of the 2025 Draft. He scored 51 points for Kingston of the OHL last season and is noted for his strong two-way game. At 18, Hopkins has time to refine his skills, but his hockey sense makes him a player worth monitoring.Goaltender Artur Akhtyamov continues to work toward NHL opportunities after being drafted in 2020. Last season, he appeared in 26 games with the Toronto Marlies in the American Hockey League. He posted 11 wins, three shutouts, and gained valuable experience in his first North American season. The 23-year-old will battle for positioning within Toronto’s depth chart.The Maple Leafs enter the season with a balanced mix of prospects. Cowan could make an immediate impact, while Danford and Chadwick provide defensive strength for the future. Hopkins and Akhtyamov round out a group that gives Toronto a combination of short-term possibilities and long-term hope for roster stability.Also Read: NHL Trade News: Why Steve Yzerman’s trade of Jake Walman still puzzles Red Wings fans","The Toronto Maple Leafs are looking ahead to the 2024-25 season.

Joe Flacco’s spot isn't safe: Pressure hits from the first snap

Rich Eisen Is STUNNED by Browns Opting for Rookies Shedeur Sanders/Dillon Gabriel to Backup Flacco

Rookies ready to shine: Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders waiting in the wings

Week 1 could flip the script for the Browns

The Cleveland Browns are entering the 2025 season with a quarterback storyline that has fans and analysts on edge. Joe Flacco has been named the starter, but rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders have both claimed spots on the 53-man roster. As the Browns prepare to face the Cincinnati Bengals in their season opener, one misstep from Flacco could instantly reshape the depth chart. With two talented rookies waiting in the wings, Week 1 promises high stakes and big surprises.Joe Flacco brings veteran savvy to Cleveland, yet even experienced quarterbacks aren’t immune to early-season scrutiny. The Bengals’ defense is known for forcing mistakes, and Week 1 could test Flacco’s poise immediately. Analyst Rich Eisen highlighted the fragile balance in the Browns’ QB lineup, “One Trey Hendrickson get off in Week 1 and the Browns may have either Dillon Gabriel or Shedeur Sanders as their go-forward quarterback,” Eisen said.He added context about Flacco’s strengths, “And it's not like, Flacco's a spring chicken. He is smart enough to read a defense and get rid of a football and protect himself, which is great news.”Behind Flacco, Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders have shown flashes of brilliance during training camp and preseason games. Gabriel, drafted in the third round, combines mobility and a quick release, while Sanders has impressed with poise and football IQ. Both rookies are ready to step up if given the chance.Eisen noted the intriguing decision the Browns face, “But at the end of the day of getting Flacco, acquiring Kenny Pickett, and then drafting Dillon Gabriel in the third round before Shedeur, only to take Shedeur anyway at the end of the day, it is now going to be a fascinating choice as to who is second on the depth chart for the Cleveland Browns.”The opener against Cincinnati is a proving ground. Flacco must demonstrate leadership under pressure, while Gabriel and Sanders wait for their opportunity. Coaching decisions will be closely watched, and a single misstep could dramatically shift Cleveland’s QB hierarchy.The Browns’ quarterback situation blends talent with uncertainty. Week 1 could influence not only who starts, but also the offensive approach, roster moves, and even future draft considerations. Fans will be watching closely to see which rookie emerges and whether Flacco can navigate the high-pressure start to the season.Also read: Saints shock fans with bold roster move, release 2023 second-round defensive end Isaiah Foskey as team reshapes defense","Cleveland Browns quarterback Joe Flacco has been named the starter, but rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders have both claimed spots on the 53-man roster.
