Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson became father for the 9th time at the age of 60 as wife Carrie Johnson announced the birth of daughter, Poppy Eliza Josephine Johnson, in an Instagram post shared on Saturday.

Auston Matthews and his fans got emotional as his mother opened up about the financial struggles of getting him into hockey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/auston-matthews-and-his-fans-got-emotional-as-his-mother-opened-up-about-the-financial-struggles-of-getting-him-into-hockey/articleshow/121166477.cms,"Image credit - Paige Taylor White/CP

Auston Matthews’ hockey dream wasn’t cheap and his mom took the weight

“I used to work in the morning for Starbucks, in the afternoon the restaurant, i was very fortunate to have two jobs. And believe me, if they would have more hours, I would have more jobs.""

Before Auston Matthews was an NHL superstar, his biggest supporter was clocking into two jobs, trying to make ends meet. His mom, Ema Matthews, didn’t just believe in his dream, she bankrolled it, penny by penny, from behind a Starbucks counter. For families without deep pockets, hockey can be financially brutal. But Ema’s resilience turned obstacles into opportunity and her son into one of the league’s brightest stars. Her story is the heartwarming reminder that every great athlete often has a real-life superhero cheering from the sidelines, sacrificing, hustling, and holding it all together so their child can chase the impossible.Ice time, gear, coaching, travel, youth hockey isn’t just a sport, it’s a financial beast. For the Matthews family, especially with Ema being originally from Hermosillo, Mexico, the culture and cost of the sport were both daunting. But she took on the challenge without hesitation, picking up multiple jobs including a gig at Starbucks to ensure Auston never missed a chance to grow on the ice.Ema shared in a past interview that the cost of hockey often reached up to $20,000 a year, a heavy ask for any middle-class family. To make it work, she didn’t just cut corners, she picked up shifts and poured lattes while helping Auston stay focused on the sport. She even deposited small amounts of money in his account so he could grab food with teammates like a regular teen. Beyond that, Ema often drove long hours to tournaments, handled equipment costs, and juggled bills, all to ensure Auston had every chance to chase his dreams without added stress.Ema’s story also breaks stereotypes. In a sport dominated by players from Canada and northern U.S. states, Auston’s rise as a player of Mexican heritage makes his success even more impactful. It's not just about talent, it’s about trailblazing, especially for kids of color or immigrant families who rarely see themselves represented in hockey.Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL. He’s not just known for his goal-scoring skills but also for his poise and work ethic, traits his mom likely helped instill. While fans celebrate his success on the ice, stories like Ema’s remind us of the sacrifices behind the scenes that made it possible.Ema Matthews’ story shows what’s possible when love, grit, and hustle lead the way.Also read - “From baptism to strip club”: Pete Blackburn’s unhinged NHL comparison is going viral and fans totally get it","Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL.

Monaco Qualifying race results

Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, who dominated all three free practice sessions in Monaco, came close to securing pole position in the Monaco Grand Prix qualifying session. However, McLaren’s Lando Norris pulled off a stunning lap to steal pole at the last moment, setting the fastest ever lap of Monaco with a time of 1m 09.954s on Saturday. Leclerc had to settle for second on the grid, while McLaren’s Oscar Piastri secured third place.Lewis Hamilton showed significant improvement in his Ferrari and qualified fourth. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, despite showing early promise, struggled later in the session and could only manage fifth place, finishing just behind Hamilton — a rare occurrence this season.Traffic once again proved to be a major factor on the narrow streets of Monaco, where overtaking is notoriously difficult. This makes the starting grid critically important for Sunday’s race. The fight for pole was intensely competitive, with positions constantly changing among McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton, and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen.Mercedes endured a disappointing session. Neither George Russell nor Kimi Antonelli managed to complete qualifying. Antonelli hit the barriers at the Nouvelle Chicane and retired, while Russell's car suffered a sudden power failure in the tunnel, bringing out the red flags.The cause of the failure remains unclear.Among the standout performances in Saturday’s qualifying was Isack Hadjar of Racing Bulls, who finished sixth. He was followed by Aston Martin’s Fernando Alonso in seventh, after the team's new technical director made his first appearance at a race this season a day before.Three other drivers who deserve recognition include Haas’s Esteban Ocon, who qualified eighth; Racing Bulls’ Liam Lawson, who finished ninth; and Alexander Albon, who rounded out the top ten. Carlos Sainz endured a difficult session and had to settle for 11th place on the grid.Also Read: Monaco Grand Prix 2025: Schedule, timings, where to watch the race and weather forecast The main Monaco Grand Prix race is scheduled for Sunday at 3:00 PM local time (6:30 PM IST).

Julian Edelman calls out NFL’s ‘cheap’ playoff pay: Even Tom Brady got screwed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/julian-edelman-calls-out-nfls-cheap-playoff-pay-even-tom-brady-got-screwed/articleshow/121363637.cms,"Julian Edelman speaks out on NFL’s ‘cheap’ playoff pay (Getty Images)

NFL players take a major pay cut during the playoffs—even the superstars

How NFL Contracts ACTUALLY Work | Games With Names

Brock Purdy's big contract strikes a chord with Edelman

When fans watch NFL stars like Tom Brady or Patrick Mahomes dominate in the playoffs, most assume they're pocketing millions for every throw, every touchdown, every win. But as former New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman recently explained, that assumption couldn’t be further from the truth.Appearing on the Games with Names podcast, Edelman peeled back the curtain on how playoff compensation works in the NFL. Unlike the regular season, where paychecks are determined by massive contracts and performance bonuses, postseason pay is a fixed structure. Everyone—from the franchise quarterback to the backup kicker—earns the same per game, regardless of their regular-season salary.“For the first round you’d get like twenty grand, twenty-five grand to the winner,” Edelman shared. “The next round, you’d get like an additional thirty grand. We would get the first-round bye, do the same amount of work, and not get paid. It was only twenty grand, but I was making like one hundred grand at the time.”That pay gap becomes even more jarring when you look at elite quarterbacks like Brady and Mahomes. “Tom Brady usually gets $2 million a game,” Edelman explained. “He’s going to play for $20,000. Patrick Mahomes is getting $50 million a year, and now he’s getting twenty grand, thirty grand… Same as the long snapper.”The league’s playoff pay system, though controversial among players, does reinforce one unique NFL value: team unity. “Everyone in the organization earns the same amount of money for playoff games,” Edelman pointed out. For trainers, assistant coaches, and lesser-known players, the extra checks are meaningful, even if they seem like a rounding error for top-tier stars.Edelman also took a moment to celebrate 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy’s new five-year, $265 million deal. As a fellow seventh-round pick, Edelman knows the grind of proving oneself.“As a former player, you always like to see guys get paid,” he said. “Especially a guy that went his route. I was a seventh-round guy, he’s a seventh-round guy. Now he’s making $54 million per year.”Also Read: Tom Brady risks it all at Indy 500: NFL legend trades football fame for 200 mph thrill ride with Jimmie Johnson Purdy’s new contract averages nearly $3 million per week—a staggering rise from the $2.6 million total he earned in his first three seasons.

Why dragging out the Aaron Rodgers saga could damage Steelers' playoff hopes beyond repair,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-dragging-out-the-aaron-rodgers-saga-could-damage-steelers-playoff-hopes-beyond-repair/articleshow/121367105.cms,"Steelers’ patience with Aaron Rodgers may backfire unless they make a bold quarterback decision now (Getty Images)

Steelers need to end Aaron Rodgers dream and chase a realistic quarterback solution before camp begins



Why are the Steelers STILL Waiting on Aaron Rodgers? | James Skrmetta Reacts

As the NFL world waits for Aaron Rodgers’ next move, the Pittsburgh Steelers remain in a holding pattern. Team president Art Rooney II recently told ESPN that they plan to wait ""a little while longer"" for Rodgers’ decision—a familiar stance he echoed more than a month ago. But beneath the surface of patience lies a deeper reality: Rodgers to Pittsburgh might make for compelling headlines, but it’s a move that could derail more than it could deliver.On paper, Aaron Rodgers signing with the Steelers would be “absolute cinema.” Imagine a future Hall of Famer attempting to resurrect his career with a storied franchise starved for playoff relevance. The Steelers, after all, have gone eight years without a postseason victory. They finished 10-3 last season only to collapse down the stretch, losing five straight—including a bruising playoff exit against Baltimore where they allowed 299 rushing yards. The logic? Plug Rodgers into an already competitive roster, add a receiver he’s comfortable with, and make a deep postseason run.It sounds like a Hollywood script. But the NFL isn’t scripted, and this move comes with layers of complication.Rodgers’ ability to turn a game on its head hasn’t vanished entirely—his touchdown pass to Garrett Wilson last season served as a dazzling reminder. Yet moments of brilliance were overshadowed by inconsistency and visible signs of decline. The same quarterback who delivered an MVP campaign in 2021 looked hesitant and off-rhythm in stretches last year. A mid-season loss to Pittsburgh saw him picked off twice by then-rookie Beanie Bishop Jr. , a sign of how erratic his play can be under pressure.And let’s not forget, this is a quarterback entering his age-42 season, fresh off a major Achilles injury. His trademark mobility—the element that made him lethal—has faded. Steelers fans saw how Ben Roethlisberger’s final seasons unfolded: the body slowed, the offense stagnated, and a living legend gradually became a liability. Rodgers, it seems, is on a similar trajectory.Rodgers isn’t just a quarterback—he’s a media magnet. Every appearance on the Pat McAfee Show will make headlines. Every sideline interaction will be scrutinized. For a franchise known for its discipline and unity under Mike Tomlin, the Rodgers spotlight might bring more distraction than direction.Then there's the impact on internal development. Young talents like Will Howard—a promising college national champion—and Mason Rudolph, who ended last season on a high note, deserve a real opportunity. Bringing in Rodgers essentially pushes both down the pecking order, sending a message that name recognition trumps offseason effort and chemistry. That’s not just demoralizing—it’s destabilizing.Even if Aaron Rodgers returns to form, Pittsburgh would still need a lot to go right. The offensive line, though improving, is young. The receiving corps lacks a proven No. 2 option to pair with DK Metcalf. And defensively, the unit that crumbled late last season must take a major step forward.Let’s be honest—2025 is shaping up to be a transitional season. With a treasure chest of draft capital in 2026, the Steelers are likely viewing this year as an experiment: a chance to test the roster’s ceiling before going all-in on a long-term quarterback solution. In that light, signing Rodgers becomes more of a stunt than a strategy.There’s no denying Rodgers brings intrigue, experience, and the potential for one last great chapter. But the Steelers are chasing stability, not spectacle. A franchise that has prided itself on consistency and calculated decisions doesn’t need to gamble on a quarterback whose best days are behind him—no matter how legendary he is.In the end, the Steelers’ path forward likely lies not in the past greatness of Aaron Rodgers, but in the untapped potential of the next generation.Also Read: Should Tom Brady unretire to lead Team USA in flag football at the 2028 Olympics?

WWE Superstar Zoey Stark made her comeback to the limelight in a tragic manner on the recent episode of Monday Night RAW. What was supposed to be a critical milestone in her career, Stark got severely injured in her knee in a triple-threat qualifying match for the 2025 Women's Money in the Bank (MITB) ladder match. The incident has not only sidelined her from one of WWE’s most prestigious events but may also signal a prolonged absence from in-ring competition.The accident occurred at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, South Carolina, during a MITB qualifier bout between Zoey Stark, Kairi Sane, and Rhea Ripley. At its climax, Stark tried her characteristic springboard dropkick—a sportslike move that requires agility and accuracy. In targeting Kairi Sane, Stark slipped in executing the springboard, resulting in her awkwardly landing on her right leg.The blow caused her knee to bend in a distinctly unnatural manner, quite visibly startling both supporters and commentators. The match instantly became secondary as paramedics rushed onto the field to treat the hurt athlete. After the botched maneuver, Stark fell to the floor, cradling her right knee and exhibiting obvious signs of pain and distress. The referee stopped the match for a moment and motioned for medical attention. WWE ringside physicians made their way into the ring and evaluated her condition.Despite the extent of the injury, Stark first tried to leave the ring independently. She tried to stand, only to fall again, as she could no longer bear the weight of herself. Eventually, she was assisted backstage by medical personnel, affirming the severity of the ordeal.Veteran WWE play-by-play commentator Michael Cole guessed on-air that Stark may have re-aggravated an old injury. Stark had extensive knee surgery in 2021 to repair a torn ACL, MCL, and meniscus—injuries requiring months of rehabilitation.With the visual similarity and reaction of Stark, there is an increasing fear that her current injury is a recurrence or exacerbation of the same condition of the knee. But to date, WWE has not issued a formal medical diagnosis or recovery timeline. The wrestling fraternity came in support of Stark after the injury. AEW wrestler Thunder Rosa showed her concern with a heartfelt post on social media:""Wrestling is a lovely and risky sport. We leave everything on the table every time we go to the ring, and we also put a lot on the line when we do what we are passionate about. Zoey Stark, I love you, sister, and I hope that you heal soon."" — Thunder Rosa through X (previously Twitter)Zoey Stark's RAW match was her first on television since January. She had last remained an active member of the dissolved faction Pure Fusion Collective, after Sonya Deville and Shayna Baszler left. Stark was competing mainly in non-televised WWE house shows and sporadic Main Event tapings before this return.As a result of her earlier knee damage incurred during her stint in NXT, Stark was drafted to the main roster as part of the 2023 WWE Draft—a testament to how much the WWE believed in her promising future. The MITB qualifier was set to be a career-launching experience, which made her untimely injury so much more heartbreaking.With Stark out, the match went on between the remaining participants. Rhea Ripley took advantage of the situation, overpowering Kairi Sane and finishing the match with her characteristic Riptide finisher. The pinfall win earned Ripley a spot in the upcoming ladder match for Women's Money in the Bank, which is to be held on June 7. Ripley’s victory, however, was overshadowed by the concern surrounding Stark’s health, as WWE fans and analysts alike shifted focus to the severity of the injury.The extent of Stark’s injury remains unconfirmed by WWE, leaving her return date unknown. Given her history of severe knee damage, fans and medical experts fear that she could face another lengthy recovery process. This injury not only removes her from one of WWE’s most career-defining matches but also risks stalling the momentum she had just begun to regain. For now, Zoey Stark’s fans—and the WWE Universe as a whole—await official word from WWE’s medical team.","WWE superstar Zoey Stark suffers a painful knee injury during MITB qualifier match.

Poll Who was the standout player for Sunrisers Hyderabad in their match against RCB? Ishan Kishan Heinrich Klaasen Travis Head Pat Cummins

Sunrisers Hyderabad took to the pitch on Friday knowing well that a win will not change their standing in the table. The game however, had the potential to help Royal Challengers Bengaluru solidify their claim to booking a top-two spot ahead of the playoffs. Travis Head and Abhshek Sharma opened the game for SRH, although the RCB bowling attack took their wickets before either of them could put up a dangerous score on the board.Travis Head was dismissed for 17 by Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Abhishek Sharma fell at 34 thanks, after being caught by Phil Salt from a Lungi Ngidi delivery. While RCB mustered confidence from their dismissals, along came Ishan Kishan to spoil the party. A man down, Kishan did spectacularly well, as he dispatched boundary after boundary in the balls that followed.His tailblazing 94 from just 48 deliveries changed the game for Sunrisers as they put up a massive 231 runs on the board. Besides Kishan, Heinrich Klaasen and Aniket Verman put up brilliant cameos, adding another 50 runs in just 22 balls for SRH. Nitish Kumar Reddy, Abhinav Manohar and Pat Cummins also featured for SRH at the crease as they put up a total RCB had never chased before in the IPL . 232 from 120 deliveries was 206/1 against the Gujarat Titans in 2024.RCB took to the crease with Virat Kohli and Phil Salt opening the chase. While Kohli showed intent early on with his boundaries, he was dismissed while at 43 by Harsh Dubey. His opening partner Phil Salt marhed on for a bit more, racking up 62 runs in 32 deliveries.However, his dismissal by Pat Cummins, followed by the successive wickets of Mayank Agarwal, Rajat Patidar and Jitesh Sharma marked the starting of RCB's collapse. What followed was Bengaluru wickets falling like dominoes; not a single player that came in afterwards stood at the crease for more than 6 balls. With victory in sight, SRH bowlers showed no mercy to RCB.The Jitesh Sharma led squad was bowled out at 189, earning SRH victory by 42 runs. The win does not affect SRH's position in the points table. They remain in 8th spot with 11 points, below Kolkata Knight Riders who have 12 in 13. As for RCB, their net run rate took a massive dive to +0.255, pushing them below Punjab Kings. Prior to the game on Friday, RCB were second, and a win would have put them closer to a top-two finish.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce living together? Florida mansion sparks fan frenzy



The love story between Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce continues to unfold—this time not on stage or on the football field, but possibly under the same roof. Though the two stars have made it a point to keep their relationship under wraps since the Super Bowl, a subtle remark by Kelce on his podcast New Heights might have dropped the biggest clue yet: they could be living together.During a recent episode of the podcast, Kelce, while chatting with his brother Jason and guest Ryan Fitzpatrick, casually mentioned his Florida offseason setup in Boca Raton. “We’ve got chimneys and we’ve got furniture,” he said, describing his temporary home. It was the word “we” that sparked an online frenzy. Swifties immediately picked up on it, interpreting the phrase as a quiet confirmation that Swift may be sharing the luxurious $20 million rental with him.Travis Kelce didn’t give away much more, but when asked who was in charge of home décor, he replied, “That’s an executive decision by myself for the betterment of everyone.” While playful, the comment left fans wondering whether someone else was helping create a cozy home atmosphere—someone with a knack for aesthetics and a history of romantic discretion.The mansion in question isn’t just any property. Nestled in an exclusive gated Boca Raton community, the estate reportedly includes six bedrooms, seven-and-a-half bathrooms, a private dock, wine cellar, home theater, and an opulent spa-style pool.With rent rumored to be around $100,000 per month, the setting is fit for pop royalty—and possibly a test run for future domestic life.Although Kelce and Swift have kept a low profile since the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl loss, this subtle shift toward privacy is not random. According to insiders, the duo has intentionally stepped away from the spotlight to focus on each other. A source told Life & Style, “It’s been a dream period that’s only solidified that they’re on the same page about their future.” The couple is reportedly even “amping up wedding discussions,” with another insider stating, “Travis is ‘the one,’ and Taylor is going to marry him. It’s just a matter of when.”Their recent public appearance—a rare outing in Philadelphia for a Mother’s Day brunch with Travis’ mom Donna Kelce, brother Jason, and sister-in-law Kylie—only deepened the intrigue. Fans who spotted them described Swift as relaxed and radiant, effortlessly blending in with the Kelce clan.Despite the swirling rumors, neither Swift nor Kelce has confirmed their living arrangement. Still, between the Boca Raton slip and insider whispers about future plans, it’s clear this isn’t just a casual fling. For two megastars balancing intense careers and public scrutiny, this quiet chapter may just be the foundation of something lasting.In a world obsessed with public displays and social media confessions, Swift and Kelce seem to be choosing something far more meaningful: privacy, intention, and perhaps, a shared home.Also Read: Offset escalates drama with diss track aimed at Cardi B and her new flame Stefon Diggs","Travis Kelce casually mentioned his Florida offseason setup in Boca Raton.

A second chance at ownership that was never offered the first time

What owning her full catalog could mean for Taylor Swift's empire

In a surprising twist in one of music’s most infamous feuds, Taylor Swift may be on the verge of reclaiming the master recordings that defined the first decade of her career. According to a new report from Page Six, Scooter Braun—the very figure she accused of ""stripping"" her of her life's work—is now reportedly facilitating a potential deal to return the rights to Swift.Back in 2019, Taylor Swift ignited a cultural firestorm when she revealed that she was blindsided by the sale of her original masters to Scooter Braun’s Ithaca Holdings. Despite her repeated attempts to buy them herself, she claimed she was never given the opportunity. “Scooter has stripped me of my life’s work, that I wasn’t given an opportunity to buy,” Swift wrote in a viral Tumblr post. “Essentially, my musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it. ”Braun later sold those masters to Shamrock Capital for $300 million. Now, just six years later, the estimated value of those recordings has ballooned to somewhere between $600 million and $1 billion. And this time, the decision to bring Swift into the conversation may finally be in motion. “The team at Shamrock want to make sure that Taylor has knowledge that they are trying to put this deal to her, as they are not sure that she was ever offered them the first time around,” a source told Page Six.With a current net worth estimated at $1.6 billion, Swift could realistically afford to repurchase her original masters outright. Doing so would make her the sole owner of both her re-recordings—branded “Taylor’s Version”—and the original versions of albums like Fearless, Red, 1989, and Reputation.This unprecedented control would give Swift a rare dual-stream revenue model, allowing her to license both sets of recordings for publishing, commercials, film, and streaming—further solidifying her as one of the most powerful artists in music history.While fans love seeing her support her NFL boyfriend, Travis Kelce, who recently gushed, “I just listen to Taylor’s music… she has something for everything,” Swift is clearly focused on something far more permanent: protecting and preserving her legacy.Also Read: “Thankfully, I don't have to deal with that”: Kirk Cousins takes a jab at Travis Kelce’s body hair and Taylor Swift’s tolerance of it Should the deal go through, it would mark a full-circle moment in a saga that reshaped the industry—and a powerful victory for artists’ rights everywhere.","Taylor Swift may be on the verge of reclaiming her master recordings.

Is Shedeur Sanders the next Browns starter?

NFL champion sees Shedeur Sanders as early Browns frontrunner



How Shedeur Sanders becomes Cleveland Browns starting QB | THE HERD w/ Colin Cowherd & Drew Bledsoe

Shedeur Sanders might have entered the NFL as a fifth-round pick in the 2025 Draft, but he's quickly proving that draft position doesn’t define potential—or leadership. While many expected Dillon Gabriel, taken two rounds earlier, to draw most of the early spotlight, it’s Sanders who’s quietly making waves inside the Cleveland Browns’ quarterback room.From the moment rookie minicamp wrapped up, a buzz began building around Sanders’ presence and poise. ESPN’s Chris Canty, a Super Bowl champion turned analyst, spoke about it on Unsportsmanlike, pointing out how players are responding to the former Colorado Buffaloes quarterback.“I'm going with whoever my locker room responds to the most,” Canty said. “Just based on how the rookies reacted to him coming off of rookie minicamp. Based on what we've been hearing in terms of his interactions with veterans around the building, the coaching staff, it feels like people are gravitating toward Shedeur Sanders.”That gravitation seems genuine. Sanders has already started forming meaningful bonds within the team, including a noticeable connection with rookie running back Quinshon Judkins. Their camaraderie has surfaced on social media, offering fans a glimpse into a budding off-field friendship that could translate into real on-field synergy.Even more telling was a group photo from day one of rookie minicamp, where several teammates threw up “The Shedeur” gesture—a celebration Sanders popularized. Interestingly, Sanders himself chose not to flash it in that moment, perhaps a quiet nod to the humility and team-first mindset he’s adopting as he finds his footing in Cleveland.Sanders doesn’t just bring talent; he brings an infectious calmness and charisma. His natural ease with the media and in public appearances has drawn comparisons to veteran quarterbacks. At the recent NFLPA Rookie Premiere, he was all smiles, even joking about sharing a room with Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco.“It’s just so funny. We’re on the same team,” Sanders said. “People try to put us against each other, but inside the room, we know we are one.”In a league where rookies often tread lightly, Sanders seems to be walking with a quiet confidence—likely inherited from his father, NFL Hall of Famer and current Colorado coach Deion Sanders. Canty agrees.“Shedeur Sanders is the leader in the clubhouse because he's comfortable in that environment—because he's been around the NFL all his life. His dad is Deion Sanders.”The Browns’ quarterback competition is anything but light. Sanders is up against the likes of Flacco, Gabriel, Kenny Pickett, and possibly even Deshaun Watson if he returns healthy. Still, early impressions suggest Sanders isn’t intimidated. Instead, he's leaning into the challenge—earning trust, building chemistry, and making it impossible for coaches and teammates to overlook him.While the official starter remains unnamed, one thing’s clear: Shedeur Sanders is not here just to take part. If this momentum continues, the Browns might find themselves turning to a rookie not just for potential—but for leadership and results.Also Read: Not just a Swiftie: Travis Kelce’s cousin sparks backlash after shutting down bandwagon fan accusations",Shedeur Sanders is making waves in the Cleveland Browns' quarterback room.

Rob Gronkowski clears the air on wild Aaron Hernandez masturbation claims during Patriots meetings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/rob-gronkowski-clears-the-air-on-wild-aaron-hernandez-masturbation-claims-during-patriots-meetings/articleshow/121366604.cms,"Rob Gronkowski addressed a long-standing, bizarre rumor about Aaron Hernandez allegedly masturbating during Patriots team meetings, calling it “crazy.” (Getty Images)

Gronk calls out “crazy” Aaron Hernandez meeting story fans still can't stop talking about



Rob Gronkowski, known as much for his wild personality as for his dominant career on the football field, is no stranger to shocking stories. But his latest appearance on the Bussin’ With the Boys podcast has fans doing a double take. When a long-standing rumor about his late New England Patriots teammate Aaron Hernandez resurfaced, Gronk didn’t dodge the question—he danced on the edge of confirmation.During the candid interview, former NFL offensive lineman Taylor Lewan put it bluntly, asking Gronkowski whether it was true that Hernandez had been “in the team meeting room beating off and doing crazy s***.” Gronk’s response was classic Gronkowski—half-joking, half-jaw-dropping: “That’s a possibility, that one,” he said, laughing nervously. “I may or may not have seen it live. I’m not going to confirm nor deny. ”Instead of expressing shock or disgust, Gronk leaned into the chaotic vibe that fans have come to associate with both him and the controversial Hernandez. “I love crazy s***, though,” Gronkowski admitted. “I didn’t mind things like that. I was like, ‘Wow, that was pretty epic.’ I was a wild man myself. Nothing fazed me.”This bizarre anecdote only scratches the surface of what has become one of the most infamous legacies in NFL history.Hernandez, who shared the Patriots’ tight end room with Gronk from 2010 to 2012, was once viewed as a rising star. Together, they were a nightmare for opposing defenses. But while Gronk’s career soared, Hernandez’s life spiraled into tragedy.Hernandez was arrested in 2013 for the murder of Odin Lloyd and later convicted of first-degree murder. In 2017, he died by suicide in prison, with posthumous reports revealing that he had been suffering from Stage 3 Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE)—a severe brain condition often linked to repeated head trauma.Gronkowski, despite his usually lighthearted demeanor, admitted that the extent of Hernandez’s darkness caught him off guard. “I didn’t see it going to the level that it went to,” he said. “That was a surprise. It was a surprise to everyone because you would never expect anyone, especially in that position, to have it go to the level that it went to.”He further acknowledged that while Hernandez did show signs of unpredictability, the depths of his troubles were largely hidden. “I didn’t know it was that bad. I knew that there was definitely some wild sides to him,” Gronkowski shared.With multiple documentaries, including Netflix’s Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez, casting a spotlight on the disgraced star’s complex life, Gronkowski reflected on how Hernandez was portrayed. “With everything coming out, there’s some that I would say is true in the documentaries… there’s some that’s probably exaggerated a little bit. But there’s some that’s not exaggerated at all, either.”As a four-time Super Bowl champion and one of the NFL’s most colorful personalities, Rob Gronkowski continues to captivate both on and off the field. His recollection of Hernandez—part amusement, part sadness—adds yet another layer to a story that continues to haunt the NFL and fascinate fans.Also Read: Donald Trump mocks New York Jets in a subtle way, while praising Tim Tebow’s NFL success","Rob Gronkowski addressed a long-standing, bizarre rumor about Aaron Hernandez.

Erin Andrews faces heartbreaking loss as surrogate suffers miscarriage with her second child



Veteran sportscaster Erin Andrews shared on her podcast Calm Down with Erin and Charissa that she and husband Jarret Stoll have suffered a devastating loss. Their second child, carried via surrogate, was lost to miscarriage. Andrews, who has never shied away from discussing her struggles with infertility and surrogacy, broke the heartbreaking news during the May 22 episode, fighting back tears as she spoke.“So I have dealt with this before, but things were going really, really well. And her little heartbeat and her numbers were really good,” Andrews said, her voice quivering. The couple had allowed themselves to hope, even sharing their joy with close colleagues, before it all came crashing down.The 47-year-old FOX Sports reporter remained committed to her work, even recording the show while grappling with fresh grief. Speaking directly to producer Ryan Musick, she said through tears, “I’ve just been tearing up the whole time and trying to stay focused. But I'm also really really good at suppressing my feelings and work really helps me with that.”Erin Andrews has always used her platform to highlight the hidden emotional toll of infertility, IVF, and surrogacy.She recalled how she and Stoll had experienced loss with their first surrogate before welcoming their son Mack in 2023 through another surrogate.“We had loss with our first surrogate and luckily with our second one, we had Mack,” she said. That journey, she’s made clear, was anything but easy. Andrews was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2016, and after undergoing two surgeries, she and Stoll decided to freeze embryos in case the cancer returned. It was a decision shaped by uncertainty, but one that ultimately gave them a path to parenthood.The miscarriage has understandably shaken her. “Been sitting here thinking about Taylor Swift’s song, ‘I Can Do It with a Broken Heart.’ I’m really good at doing this s--- with a broken heart,” Andrews admitted, revealing the inner conflict of needing to be strong while crumbling inside.What makes her story resonate so deeply is her refusal to hide behind a curated image of perfection. “I just wanted to be open with people and be like, ‘This sucks.’ And today, this really does,” she said honestly. She believes that vulnerability helps others feel less alone—just as it once helped her. “Going through this whole journey, you think you’re alone. You’re not alone.”She also acknowledged how difficult the moment was for her husband. “I know my husband is having a difficult time and I’m going to go home and be with him, and then we’re going to throw our little 2-year-old in a pool and I feel like squeezes are going to feel a little different from him today.”With unwavering grace, Erin Andrews continues to advocate for open conversations around fertility, miscarriage, and mental health. “If you feel alone and you feel like a failure, I do too, but you’re not the only one,” she reminded listeners.Also Read: Could Jonathan Owens' LA 2028 hopes bring Simone Biles back to gymnastics glory?","Erin Andrews and husband Jarret Stoll lost their second child to miscarriage.

“Clutch time is different” — Stephen A. Smith credits Tyrese Haliburton’s 47% tight-defense shooting in NBA playoffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/clutch-time-is-different-stephen-a-smith-credits-tyrese-haliburtons-47-tight-defense-shooting-in-nba-playoffs/articleshow/121368600.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Tyrese Haliburton's playoff heroics challenge Jalen Brunson 's Clutch Player of the Year title

Tyrese Haliburton has emerged as the NBA's latest clutch player, shining when it counts the most. Even Stephen A. Smith, a long-time doubter and passionate New York Knicks fan, had to acknowledge Haliburton's brilliance after Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals. The Indiana Pacers' point guard not only leveled the score at the buzzer but also demonstrated a level of poise that compelled Smith to reconsider his views. As Haliburton's playoff performances continue to impress, the conversation about his superstar credentials is really heating up.In the 2024–25 NBA season, Jalen Brunson of the New York Knicks took home the Clutch Player of the Year award, leading the league with 156 clutch points and a 51.5% shooting percentage in those critical moments. Meanwhile, Tyrese Haliburton's performances in the playoffs are making a solid case for his own clutch status. In Game 1 against the Knicks, Haliburton made a game-tying shot at the buzzer, which sent the game into overtime, where the Pacers won 138–135.Haliburton really shines when the pressure's on. This season, he's hit 12 out of 14 shots (86%) to either tie or take the lead in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime, which is the highest percentage since they started keeping track in 1996–97.Plus, during the 2025 playoffs, he's gone 5-for-6 (83.3%) in those clutch moments, tying for the most in a single postseason since 1997.Stephen A. Smith, initially critical of Haliburton, acknowledged the guard's clutch performances, stating, ""So, again, clutch time is different since you're talking about the last five minutes or so. But that last shot? After we've seen what he's done against Cleveland? When we saw what he's done against the New York Knicks? When we saw what he's done throughout these playoffs? Against Milwaukee? In these playoffs, Tyrese Haliburton has been money. "" He highlighted Haliburton's 47% shooting against tight defenses in the postseason, surpassing Brunson's 45%.Haliburton's journey through the playoffs has been highlighted by significant moments: a game-winning layup against the Milwaukee Bucks, an important three-pointer to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers, and now, a critical shot against the Knicks. These performances are reshaping how his role in the league is perceived.Also Read: Steve Kerr says Jonathan Kuminga isn't ready for a starring role on a Golden State Warriors team built around Stephen Curry Tyrese Haliburton's amazing clutch plays are not just pushing the Indiana Pacers forward in the playoffs, but they're also shaking up the usual ideas about who really earns the 'superstar' title. With the Eastern Conference Finals in full swing, everyone will be watching Haliburton to find out if he can keep up this high standard and cement his status among the NBA's best.","Tyrese Haliburton's playoff heroics challenge Jalen Brunson's Clutch Player of the Year title.

Tennis Fan Pope Leo XIV Meets With Italian Player Jannik Sinner, But 'Refuses' To Play With Him

Poll What do you think is the main reason for the excitement around Alcaraz vs. Sinner matches? High quality of tennis Their rivalry's intensity Their contrasting styles Both are fan favorites

Carlos Alcaraz, the reigning French Open champion, welcomed his growing rivalry with world number one Jannik Sinner ahead of Roland Garros 2025, stating it benefits tennis while preparing for a potential final showdown. The two players have dominated recent Grand Slams, sharing the last five major titles between them, with Alcaraz speaking at a pre-tournament press conference in Paris on Friday.Alcaraz and Sinner have established themselves as the dominant forces in men's tennis. Alcaraz claimed the French Open and Wimbledon titles last year, while Sinner secured his first major at the 2024 Australian Open, followed by the US Open and successfully defended his Melbourne title in January.""I think for the people, for the tennis fans, I think it's great to have a match-up from some players that make them excited about watching that match. Right now I think the people are excited every time that I'm facing Jannik. Our matches I think are a really high quality of tennis. I think for the people and probably the people who don't like watching tennis, I think (our rivalry) is something that because of that (they have) started to watch tennis.The 22-year-old Spaniard remained modest about the rivalry's historical significance. ""I'm not gonna put myself or the great rivalry that I have with Jannik at (the) same level as those legends. Let's see in the future how it's gonna be. Right now for sure I'm not going to put ourselves into that table of that rivalries, but I think people are excited about watching our matches.""Their most recent encounter at the Italian Open final showcased their competitive spirit. Despite Sinner's three-month doping suspension preceding the tournament, Alcaraz emerged victorious with a 7-6 (7/5), 6-1 win, ending the Italian's 26-match winning streak.Alcaraz's performance in Rome elevated him to world number two, securing his position as second seed at Roland Garros behind Sinner.In the first round, Alcaraz faces former world number four Kei Nishikori, currently ranked 62nd.""Honestly, I'm really excited about facing Nishikori for the first time. I'm watching him play a lot when I was young. I was really happy when he came back again on tour. I know that he has been struggling physically the last year, a lot of injuries that kept him away from playing. I know when he plays good tennis, (he's) really tough to beat. So I have to be ready for that, for the first round... I'm excited to play against a legend like Nishikori. ""","Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have dominated recent Grand Slams.

The match was intense, with both men using the cage and chairs to inflict damage.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin. The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee. England completely skipped Saturday's practice, but many India players also skipped the optional session.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118081067,imgsize-126924,width-400,resizemode-4/118081067.jpg"

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Punjab Kings arrived at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on Saturday with a top-two finish in sight. But Delhi Capitals had other ideas, pulling off a thrilling 6-wicket win in a high-scoring contest. The result, however, does little to change the bigger picture, as both teams hold their respective positions in the table.Asked to bat first, Punjab looked set for a mammoth total with Shreyas Iyer anchoring the innings with a fluent 53 off 34 deliveries. Marcus Stoinis turned on the heat at the death with an explosive 44* from just 16 balls, guiding Punjab to a formidable 206/8. Mustafizur Rahman was the standout bowler for Delhi, picking up 3 wickets and applying the brakes at crucial moments.Delhi's chase got off to a solid start with KL Rahul scoring a quickfire 35 off 21 balls and Faf du Plessis adding 23 off 15. Though both openers fell before the halfway mark, DC’s innings stayed on course thanks to Karun Nair’s dependable 44 from 27 balls.But the real hero of the evening was Sameer Rizvi. Calm under pressure and fearless against pace, Rizvi smashed an unbeaten 58 off just 25 balls, including 5 sixes that deflated Punjab's bowling attack.He sealed the win with a maximum in the 19.3 over, sparking celebrations in the Delhi dugout.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Despite the morale-boosting win, Delhi Capitals remain 5th on the table with 15 points from 14 matches. For Punjab, the loss is a setback. Still placed 2nd with 17 points, and they now risk being overtaken by RCB or Mumbai Indians, depending on upcoming results.IPL Points Table:With this result, the race for the second spot in the playoffs is wide open. RCB, MI, and Punjab Kings all have a shot at finishing in the top two. Punjab will take on Mumbai Indians in a high-stakes final league game, while RCB face Lucknow Super Giants in their last match.

Minnesota Timberwolves’ Luka Garza now has higher playoff scoring rate than MLB legend Michael Jordan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/minnesota-timberwolves-luka-garza-now-has-higher-playoff-scoring-rate-than-mlb-legend-michael-jordan/articleshow/121389397.cms,"Minnesota Timberwolves’ Luka Garza now has higher playoff scoring rate than MLB legend Michael Jordan (Image Source: Getty)



Luka Garza’s moment to shine

“That’s what we need him to do, And when he does it, it takes us to another level. I thought that was really big in the first quarter — he got a couple of steals, he was all over the place. He knew we needed that type of play and he was really really good. This has been Ant’s pattern, He’s learning so fast, and he’s seeing so much.”

“I just think he’s very in tune with his teammates and what’s going on, As great of a player as he is, he’s the definitely of selfless.”

Luka Garza has proved to be how efficient of a scorer he is in the playoffs. While the Minnesota Timberwolves managed to create history for themselves against the Oklahoma City Thunders, Garza, on the other hand, in fact, has created history for himself.Based on points per minute, Luka Garza has scored faster than MLB legend Michael Jordan did in his playoff career. While Jordan averaged 0.8 points per minute, Garza now averages 1.03 points per minute after scoring 7 points in just 5 minutes during Game 3. Overall, Garza has scored 38 points in 37 playoff minutes.Most of his points came during “garbage time” when the game was already decided but he still made the most of his chances. In college at Iowa, he was known for scoring inside the paint, using strong post moves. He’s not the ideal modern NBA player since he doesn’t shoot much from long range, but he’s effective near the basket. Some wonder if he should get real playing time because if he gets the ball near the hoop, there’s a good chance he’ll score.In Game 3, Anthony Edwards let his game do the talking. He dominated by scoring. He hit 12 of 17 shots, including 5 three-pointers, and added 9 rebounds, 6 assists, and 2 steals, leading the Timberwolves to a huge win.Wolves coach Chris Finch said:Julius Randle, who cheered on Anthony Edwards said:Also Read: Minnesota Timberwolves Fights Back Against Oklahoma City Thunder, Anthony Edwards Leads The Team To Historic Win In Game 3 Timberwolves' big win is just the beginning of a big comeback, they’ll need more strong performances like this one, especially from Anthony Edwards, if they want him to eventually lead them to an NBA championship.",Minnesota Timberwolves’ Luka Garza now has higher playoff scoring rate than MLB legend Michael Jordan.

"A new era dawns at Roland Garros: No Rafael Nadal, slumping Iga Swiatek and no obvious favourites",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/a-new-era-dawns-at-roland-garros-no-rafael-nadal-slumping-iga-swiatek-and-no-obvious-favourites/articleshow/121386029.cms,"Carlos Alcaraz (L) and Coco Gauff (R) are two of the contenders to lift the French Open title.

For many years, the French Open had a predictability attached to it. For better or for worse, Rafael Nadal in the men’s field and Iga Swiatek in the women’s field were the safe bets. Both had stellar records to justify that billing. Nadal won 14 titles at Roland Garros (2005-2008; 2010-2014; 2017-2020; 2022) while Swiatek triumphed four years in a row (2020, 2022, 2023 and 2024). The Spaniard has dominated the red clay more than any one in the history of the sport and a 112-4 record is a clear indication of it. Still not convinced? The 14 times he reached the final, he won them all.Swiatek’s reign in women's singles has been for a shorter time period and yet has been equally impressive with four titles in five years, including the last three. Among the active players, she has the best win percentage at Roland Garros (35-2; 94.6%) and she triumphed in 2020 without dropping a set.Now, as the French Open begins on Sunday, May 25, there are no crystal clear favourites as before. 38-year-old Nadal has retired and will be on Philippe Chatrier Court only for a farewell ceremony on Sunday. He bowed out last year with his injury-hampered body not co-operating to the grind of the sport anymore. His final French Open appearance was a defeat to Alexander Zverev and Roland Garros adieu came a few weeks later at the Paris Olympics, losing to Novak Djokovic in singles, followed by doubles alongside Carlos Alcaraz.“There’s ... 20 different people that you wouldn’t be surprised if they end up winning the tournament,” said USA’s Madison Keys, whose first major trophy came at the Australian Open in January. “Part of it is because we’ve kind of lost some of our legends, obviously. Like, there’s no longer Serena Williams in every draw, where you just assume she’s going to win.""Poland’s Swiatek took over that mantle from Serena, at least in Paris, for the past five years. That cannot be said this time around.Ever since clinching the title last year, she’s not reached a final let alone win a tournament. The fifth seed has had a less than flattering clay court swing in preparation. She lost in the quarterfinals of Stuttgart, was hammered with a double breadstick by Coco Gauff in Madrid and an equally dismal show against Danielle Collins in Rome.Off the court, Swiatek has had an equally trying time. In a doping case, Swiatek was essentially cleared but did serve an oddly timed suspension.That brings us to the ‘D’ word which has gripped the sport more than on-court tennis. Swiatek now down to World No. 5 - trailing Aryna Sabalenka, Gauff, Jessica Pegula and Jasmine Paolini - and men’s World No. 1 Jannik Sinner have both been punished in different and equally peculiar ways. The Italian served a three-month ban earlier this year despite being cleared of wrongdoing by the sport’s governing body.After winning the Australian Open, Sinner reached a deal with the World Anti-Doping Agency, which appealed against the 23-year-old’s exoneration. It meant he won his third major title in Melbourne, went into a three-month hiatus, only to return for the Italian Open in Rome where he finished runner-up to Carlos Alcaraz.Alcaraz was asked about the complexity of the doping world, taking Max Purcell’s ban as an example, which he said “sounded like Chinese”. But what doesn’t sound like a foreign language is the desire to win a fifth major and second in a row in Paris. His muscle issues in both legs seemed to have become a thing of the past if the Rome final was any indication. Yet, despite his similarities and wish to pick up the mantle from Nadal, he is not a lock-in like his idol.That brings us to other contenders such as three-time major finalist Alexander Zverev, including making the last-four at Roland Garros in the last four straight editions. The inconsistent German’s best showing in the tune-up events was the title in Munich.Speaking of titles, Novak Djokovic, seeking his 25th major once again, clinched his 100th ATP trophy in Geneva, joining a list that is led by Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer. His first title since winning the gold medal at the Paris Olympics last year only faintly masks his three-match losing streak before it.“Kind of [a] new reality for me, I have to say. You know, trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament. It’s a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis, so it’s kind of a challenge for me, mentally, to really face these kinds of sensations on the court, going out early now, regularly,” Djokovic said after an opening exit in Madrid.“But that’s, I guess, the circle of life and the career. Eventually, it was going to happen. ... Grand Slams is where I really want to play the best tennis,” he added. “I’m not sure if I’ll be able to do that in Roland-Garros, but I’ll do my best.”On the women’s side, the field is open amid Swiatek’s unprecedented slump. The variety of tune-up champions tells the story - Jessica Pegula (Charleston), Jelena Ostapenko (Stuttgart), Aryna Sabalenka (Madrid) and Jasmine Paolini (Rome). Paolini became the eighth different player to reach a WTA 1000 final this season before pocketing her biggest career title.Sabalenka briefly dropped off from her best form after a surprise Australian Open final loss to Madison Keys before bouncing back with the Miami and Madrid Open titles.""I got really hungry and angry -- angry in a good way and I think at the end, the Australian Open final pushed me to work even harder,"" she told the WTA.""(It) kind of explained to me that you have to really work hard in finals and you have to earn your victories. It was a good push for me.""Coco Gauff's first final appearances in Madrid and Rome have helped her return to a career-high of World No. 2, giving her the second seeding for Paris. The 21-year-old, a former Roland Garros runner-up, is waiting for her first title since last year's WTA Finals.""Hopefully I can get to the final in Roland Garros and maybe the 'Third time lucky' thing is a real thing,"" Gauff said after losing to Paolini in Rome.There are multiple dark horses on the WTA Tour to clinch their maiden Grand Slam title, none more impressive than Mirra Andreeva.In February, she made history as the youngest-ever WTA 1000 champion in Dubai, then followed it up with an even more remarkable victory at Indian Wells.Now 18, Andreeva is a strong contender in Paris, aspiring to become the youngest Grand Slam singles champion since Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon in 2004. She showcased her credentials on clay by reaching the Roland Garros semi-finals last year and the quarter-finals in Madrid and Rome this season.Another one to be careful of is China’s 22-year-old Zheng Qinwen who will be hoping to replicate the form that took her to Olympic gold at Roland Garros last summer.",Rafael Nadal won 14 titles at Roland Garros between 2005-2008 and 2010-2014. Iga Swiatek won four years in a row at the French Open between 2020 and 2024. Nadal has retired and will be on Philippe Chatrier Court only for a farewell ceremony on Sunday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121386107,imgsize-45308,width-400,resizemode-4/121386107.jpg"
