Chahar unlikely to play any further part

CHENNAI: When Chennai Super Kings lost their sixth wicket with 122 runs on the board against Punjab Kings at the end of the 16th over in Dharamshala on Sunday, everyone expected MS Dhoni to come in. Instead, Shardul Thakur walked in to bat and didn't exactly set the stage on fire, leading to criticisms about MSD's decision to hold himself back.In fact, former CSK player Harbhajan Singh said that Dhoni should drop himself and play an extra bowler if he can't come out to bat in such situations.However, TOI has learnt that not opting to come up the order is more of a compulsion for Dhoni — CSK sources say the former captain is playing the entire IPL with a muscle tear in his leg and there is no way he can run for too long.The tear happened early in this year's IPL and had the team's second wicketkeeper — Devon Conway, who is also ruled out with an injury before the tournament, been available, MSD might have thought of giving himself a break.Such is the situation that Dhoni has to play through pain, take his medicines and try to minimize his running. In fact, he has been suggested rest by doctors but the wicketkeeper-batsman doesn't have a choice because the team has been decimated by injuries.""We are virtually playing with our ‘B' team. Those who are criticizing Dhoni don't know the sacrifice that he is doing for this team,"" a source close to the developments said.Dhoni had played the last IPL with a knee injury that had to be operated on just after CSK won the IPL. It was said the knee is completely healed now but the muscle tear has severely restricted his movements on the ground.During practice, the 42-year-old is not doing any running at all and his entire preparation is around hitting the ball out of the park.The little bit of running between the wickets that Dhoni has been forced to do during his cameos is only aggravating the injury, but the cricketer will not take a break.He has been a guiding light for new captain Ruturaj Gaikwad, who has done reasonably well. As far as Dhoni is concerned, Gaikwad's captaincy is ""still a work in progress"", but even if the team doesn't make the play-offs, he won't be removed from captaincy. ""He is giving his best and we believe we will go much beyond just making the play-offs,"" the source said.In another blow for the franchise, paceman Deepak Chahar too is unlikely to come back from a leg injury that he suffered during CSK's loss to PBKS at home last week.","CSK sources say the former captain is playing the entire IPL with a muscle tear in his leg and there is no way he can run for too long.

NEW DELHI: Michael Olise 's two goals propelled Crystal Palace to a resounding 4-0 triumph over Manchester United at Selhurst Park on Monday, marking the first time in their history that Palace have secured a league double over the Red Devils. The result will undoubtedly intensify the scrutiny on United manager Erik ten Hag .Palace's attack repeatedly exploited United's patchwork defence, which featured Casemiro playing out of position at centre-back.Jean-Philippe Mateta and Tyrick Mitchell also found the back of the net in the commanding victory.Despite the loss, United remain in eighth place with 54 points from 35 games, trailing sixth-placed Newcastle United by two points. Their chances of securing European football for the upcoming season are rapidly diminishing. Palace, on the other hand, sit in 14th place with 43 points from 36 matches.United's injury woes were compounded by the absence of Bruno Fernandes, who missed a match due to injury for the first time in his 230-game Old Trafford career. The ease with which they were defeated will be a significant concern for everyone associated with the club.This marks the first instance in the Premier League era that United have suffered 13 defeats in a single season, and the scoreline could have been even more lopsided.Under the guidance of new manager Oliver Glasner, Palace have found their rhythm, while United are stumbling towards the end of a season that cannot conclude soon enough for Ten Hag.","Crystal Palace defeated Manchester United 4-0 at Selhurst Park on Monday.

spot with win

NEW DELHI: It's that time of the IPL when every game becomes crucial in terms of race to the Playoffs. Each point matters, especially for those mid-table teams that are in a mad scramble.Tuesday's IPL clash between Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Capitals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium is one such game. One team (Rajasthan Royals) is looking to seal their spot in the Playoffs and the other (Delhi Capitals) will aim to keep their campaign alive.Besides the clash between the two teams, there is a subplot that fans will keep a keen eye on.The battle between the two captains, Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson . Both have been selected in India's squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup in America and the Caribbean and each would look to outdo the other in order to get into the playing XI as the team's No. 1 wicketkeeper-batsman.The test at the Arun Jaitley Stadium will involve all parameters – wicketkeeping, batting and also leadership skills.So far both have led with aplomb. Sanju's RR has minimal weaknesses and combined with his astute captaincy, the team is deservedly placed second in the points table with four games (including Tuesday's match) in hand.Pant, on the other hand, doesn't have a well-oiled team like Rajasthan at his disposal. Still, he has got the best out of his players, considering the number of injury-related issues the franchise has faced. Harry Brook, Lungi Ngidi, Mitchell Marsh – all first XI players – were lost at different stages of the tournament. Pant, on his part, has put up a brave face and not let his performance go down.The left-hander has batted in a lionhearted manner and scored 398 runs at an average of 44.22 and a phenomenal strike-rate of 158.56 in the tournament so far.There is little to choose between the two in terms of numbers, as Sanju has scored 385 runs at an average of 64.16 and a strike-rate of 159.09 till now. With the World Cup approaching, this game will give a glimpse to who among the two will have an upper hand going into the marquee tournament.As far as team news goes, DC will get back the services of Ishant Sharma, who has been declared fit. But, his teammate David Warner is “yet to be passed fit”. Head coach Ricky Ponting gave the information in the pre-match press conference.""They both trained yesterday (Sunday). In fact, Ishant trained three of the last five days. We're happy with what we've seen from him. As of now, he's fit for selection,"" Ponting said. ""Warner had a few days off. He also did some batting in the nets for about 20 minutes. He will go through his final paces, but he is still to be passed fit. But from what I've seen, he's a whole lot better.""",Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Capitals play each other at the Arun Jaitley Stadium. Rajasthan looking to seal their spot in the IPL playoffs.

Rinku Singh: T20 World Cup: Why India needed a Rinku-first policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-why-india-needed-a-rinku-first-policy/articleshow/109902034.cms,"In a press conference explaining Team India 's selection for the World Cup, BCCI 's chief selector Ajit Agarkar said that Rinku Singh was ""the toughest thing to discuss…it was all about the combination we wanted."" The chief selector meant that the committee did its best but it couldn't find Rinku a place considering the big picture. It also came to light that captain Rohit Sharma wanted four spinners for the squad which had reduced the options for the selectors.A day later, former India captain and ex-BCCI president Sourav Ganguly shared a similar view.What's clear from these statements is that the 26-year-old batter from Aligarh wasn't thought of as an automatic selection. Rather, he was at best considered as the last possible player for the 15-member squad, and later consigned to the reserves.Here's why such a thought process is erroneous. India won the T20 World Cup for the first and last time in 2007, the year before IPL arrived. In the seven editions, thereafter, it has entered the final only once (2014) and semifinal twice (2016 & 2022). England, West Indies, even Pakistan and Sri Lanka enjoy better records than India.A key reason behind these failures is the team's inability to produce its best cricket in high pressure knock-out games in the World Cup. Most players considered essential by the selectors are the same blokes who have been unable to perform time and again in these matches.That's why India needed a Rinku-first policy. Here was a journeyman who emerged from the shadows to capture national spotlight delivering wins from near-impossible situations in IPL 2023 and, of late, in T20Is to become India's elusive 911 man. On recent international performance and making a comparative assessment of his temperament in tough situations with other so-called ‘undroppables', his selection should have been the easiest, not the ""toughest"" decision to make. How many proven – not on paper -- finishers in T20Is, especially in tough situations, does this team's lower batting order have?Let's walk the talk with hard statistics. Rinku has played 15 T20Is, batted in 11 innings, remained unbeaten in 7. Barring a couple of games, he made invaluable contributions improving the team's situation in each of them. His strike rate is 176; average 89. No surprise former internationals such as Kris Srikkanth, Irfan Pathan and Ambati Rayudu have also spoken up over his non-inclusion.His freewheeling undefeated 37 off 14 balls gave India the edge in a crucial Asian Games tie against Nepal. Nepal scored 179/9 in the game; India won by just 23 runs, and in retrospect, Rinku's input was critical.Against Australia in Thiruvananthapuram last November, Rinku blitzkrieged an unbeaten 31 off 9 deliveries. The innings underlined that he could move into fifth gear at a moment's notice. In the same series, he smashed 46 off 29 balls, the highest score in the team with the second highest run rate. India won that game too. Then again, last December against South Africa in faraway Gqeberha, his unconquered 68 off 39 balls was the side's highest score with the highest strike rate.In Bengaluru this January, in his last international game against Afghanistan, Rinku was outstanding in a tough situation. Coming in to bat with India 22/4, he produced in tandem with Rohit Sharma an unbeaten game-changing partnership of 190. It is surprising that Rohit, who scored an unbeaten 121 (off 69) in that nerve-jangling game, couldn't place him among 15.In all these knocks as well as in IPL 2023, Rinku's batting displayed calm, power and situational awareness. He found a way to outwit bowlers, mould his shotmaking to the situation.If Rinku's recent IPL form was a reason for his omission, what about several other selected players whose form seems to be getting worse with every passing game? That aside, there's a lack of consistency in selection logic. If Dube, who averages nearly 40 and has a strike rate of 145 in T20Is, was rewarded for his superlative IPL show, why isn't medium pacer T Natarajan even in the reserves. His current IPL stats -- wickets, economy rate, strike rate – as well as ball control and ability to bowl at the death is superior to the chosen ones.Team India may or may not perform well at the forthcoming World Cup beginning in June. But irrespective of the result, the omission of Rinku Singh will remain a case of grave injustice.","The 26-year-old batter from Aligarh wasn't thought of as an automatic selection.

After four consecutive defeats, Mumbai Indians (MI) lifted the gloom in the dressing room in style as Suryakumar Yadav 's sensational century led the cheers in the home team's seven-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in their IPL match at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Monday.Chasing SRH's 173 for 8, MI were in a spot of bother at 31 for 3, but Surya launched a counter-attack to score 51-ball 102 not out, including 12 fours and 6 sixes, to deflated SRH bowling with his 360-degree batting.He added 143 runs in an unbeaten fourth-wicket partership with Tilak Varma (37 not out).Earlier in SRH innings, MI captain Hardik Pandya (3 for 31) and veteran legspinner Piyush Chawla (3 for 33) led the bowling charts with three wickets each to restrict the visitors, who could reach a competitive total only because of opener Travis Head's 48 off 30 balls and skipper Pat Cummins's 17-ball cameo of 35 not out.The commentators were in awe of Surya's T20 batting skills as he completed his century with a match-winning six off the second ball of the 17th over.""I have done this after a long time,"" said Surya at the post-match presentation. ""I fielded for 20 overs and batted for 18 overs, only tired.""Skipper Hardik said it was an ""unbelievable"" knock by Surya.""It's unbelievable! The best past of SKY is that he puts the bowlers under pressure. It's sheer confidence...He can change a game in a different way. Lucky to have him in our side,"" said Hardik after the match.While Mumbai's playoff hopes are only mathematically alive in the ongoing IPL, Surya's litmus test will be at the T20 World Cup in the US and West Indies, beginning June 2.If MI don't reach the playoffs, Surya will have time to rest as well as refocus for the big-ticket T20 tournament, where India will begin their campaign with the group game against Ireland on June 5 in New York, followed by the big match against Pakistan on June 9 at the same venue.Co-hosts USA and Canada are the other two teams in India's group.","Mumbai Indians beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by seven wickets in IPL match.

NEW DELHI: Suryakumar Yadav 's exceptional century, combined with disciplined bowling, propelled Mumbai Indians to a seven-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL on Monday.Suryakumar's explosive innings of 102 not out from 51 balls marked his second IPL century, helping his team secure an emphatic win in just 17.2 overs. SRH had earlier recovered to post 173 for eight.The win moved Mumbai Indians up from the bottom of the points table to ninth place, while SRH, despite the loss, stayed in fourth place with 12 points from 11 games.Joining forces inside the powerplay with MI left reeling at 31 for three, the pair of Suryakumar and Tilak Varma (37 not out off 32) did a superb recovery job with 143-run unbeaten stand to script a comprehensive victory. Suryakumar's sensational knock included 12 fours and half a dozen sixes.For that matter, MI could have been reduced to 31/4 had a Bhuvneshwar Kumar delivery in the fifth over not pitched outside the leg stump with the veteran seamer pinning Varma in front of the wickets.Ishan Kishan (9) perished early once again while Naman Dhir (0) endured a nine-ball duck.With their backs against the wall, Suryakumar picked Marco Jansen to attack as he collected 22 runs off the seventh over with two sixes and two fours to begin his job.But shortly after he completed his fifty off 30 balls, Suryakumar was seen stretching and wincing in pain while looking to manage a strain, presumably to his groin — one of the reasons why he missed cricket for nearly four months from late last year.However, to his credit, the world No 1 T20 batter hung around till the end to take MI over the line as he finished the game with a flurry of boundaries — two sixes and as many fours off his last four balls.Apart from Suryakumar's struggles while batting, the decline in Rohit Sharma 's form also came to the fore with the India captain mistiming one to be dismissed for a mere four — his fourth score in single digits this IPL in last five outings.Earlier in the first half, Pandya struck form before the T20 World Cup while veteran Chawla also bagged three wickets as Mumbai Indians restricted Sunrisers Hyderabad for a below-par total.Pandya found rhythm and momentum to return 4-0-31-3 while Chawla (4-0-33-3) produced an impactful performance to trouble the SRH batters.However, to his credit, SRH skipper Pat Cummins chipped in with a 17-ball 35 (2x4s, 2x6s) late in the innings to take them past the 150-run mark.In complete contrast to last time these teams met earlier in this IPL when SRH hammered 277/3, their usually free-flowing batters struggled for momentum and lack of initiative meant they could never really trouble the Mumbai bowlers.Travis Head top scored with 48 while skipper Pat Cummins made a quick 17-ball 35 not out.","Mumbai Indians beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by seven wickets in IPL.

'Not sure why I was blocked': David Warner opens up on unceremonious exit from Sunrisers Hyderabad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/not-sure-why-i-was-blocked-david-warner-opens-up-on-unceremonious-exit-from-sunrisers-hyderabad/articleshow/109893648.cms,"(With inputs from ANI)

NEW DELHI: Explosive Australian opener David Warner recently opened his unexpected exit from his former Indian Premier League team Sunrisers Hyderabad In an appearance on Ravichandran Ashwin's YouTube channel, Warner described his departure from SRH as 'bizarre'.After playing for Delhi Capitals from 2009-13 in the IPL, Warner was bought by SRH in 2014 and stayed with the franchise till 2021.However, despite winning the 2016 IPL with the franchise as a captain and scoring heaps of runs for the Orange Army, the Aussie experienced an unceremonious exit from the side, which came slowly.First, he was sacked as a captain midway through the 2021 season because of his poor form and frequent losses for SRH. New Zealand batter Kane Williamson replaced him as the captain after Warner lost five out of the first six games of the season.In the second half of the season, not only Warner was dropped, but also blocked by the franchise on social media. Sadness was visible on Warner's face, as he even carried drinks for his team during matches. SRH finished at the bottom with three wins and 11 losses. Warner also scored poorly, making just 195 runs in eight innings with two fifties at an average of 24.38 and a sub-par strike rate of just over 107, which is not associated with his more attacking gameplay.Speaking on Ashwin's channel, Warner said that the treatment from the team management and him being blocked from social media did hurt him because it was also a ""hurt for fans"", something Warner considered really important during his stint with the franchise.""It did hurt because it was a sense of like hurt for fans. The fans are the most important relationship you could have. The engagement with the fans that I had, with the team had was very good,"" Warner said.""I am not sure why I was blocked. But I did engage with a lot of fans on the social media side for SRH. I did feel it was my duty to engage with the fans, making sure they kept coming back. That is what is most important. But from the blocking point of view, I do not know. I have been sitting on it for about 5 years. It was bizarre. At the end of the day, I still have fans who come onto my page and talk to everyone. So it is great,"" he added.Warner's stint with SRH made him an IPL legend and possibly the best overseas player to have graced the league. In 95 matches, he scored 4,014 runs at an average of 49.56 and a strike rate of 142.59, with two centuries and 40 fifties. His best score was 126. He not only won an IPL title for his side in 2016 as a skipper, but also won the 'Orange Cap' honour for most runs in a season thrice, in 2015, 2017 and 2019, the most by any batter in league history.Warner was bought by DC ahead of IPL 2022 for Rs 6.25 crore. In 88 matches for DC, Warner has made 2,550 runs at an average of 31.88 and a strike rate of 135.64, with two centuries and 22 fifties. His best score is 109*. However, he has not won any IPL title with DC.In 2024 season, Warner has scored just 167 runs in seven games at an average of 23.85 and a strike rate of 135.77, with a knock of 52 as his solitary fifty. He is currently out due to a finger injury and his team will play Rajasthan Royals (RR) on Tuesday at Delhi's Arun Jaitley Stadium.",David Warner opened up about his exit from Sunrisers Hyderabad.

NEW DELHI: Chelsea significantly improved their prospects of participating in European competitions in the upcoming season by delivering a resounding 5-0 victory against West Ham in the Premier League on Sunday. The goals were scored by Cole Palmer , Conor Gallagher , Noni Madueke , and Nicolas Jackson , who netted twice.Palmer, aged 21, capitalized on a loose ball following a cross from Madueke in the 15th minute and precisely placed his shot into the far corner, beyond the reach of West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola.It marked his 21st league goal in his maiden season with the London club.Gallagher, the team captain, also took advantage of a loose ball in the penalty area after a tackle on Madueke and emphatically converted his opportunity on the half-hour mark, exposing the disorganization in West Ham's defence.Madueke transitioned from assisting to scoring, and back again, on either side of the halftime break. He scored from close range in the 36th minute following a corner kick and then set up Jackson for Chelsea's fourth goal in the 48th minute.Jackson added his second goal of the match 10 minutes from the end, latching onto a long pass from Moises Caicedo and remaining onside, as confirmed by a VAR review.The outcome propelled Chelsea to seventh place in the league table, surpassing Manchester United , who have a match scheduled for Monday.

And with India's back to the wall and a job at stake, coach Igor Stimac finally opened the doors for Indian talents in I-League to be included in the national team squad.On Saturday, the head coach announced the first list of probables for June's crucial World Cup qualifiers and it included four players - three of whom are from Mizoram - from the erstwhile top-division league that had lost its relevance in India team selection under the Croatian.With the job at hand being guiding India to end as one of the top two teams in Group A, Mohammedan SC's Indian top scorer David Lalhlansanga, Aizawl FC striker Lalrinzuala Lalbiaknia, Inter Kashi midfielder Edmund Lalrindika and Real Kashmir defender Muhammad Hammad were called for the four-week camp in Bhubaneswar starting on Friday.Former Aizawl FC forward Lalhlansanga, who played a vital role in Mohammedan's stupendous run to I-League title this season, scored five goals with two assists in 22 appearances for the champions this season.The 22-year-old's state-mate and an attacker in his former club, Lalrinzuala created history by becoming the highest Indian goal-scorer in I-League with 15 goals and broke the record held by his idol Sunil Chhetri and Mohammed Rafi .Meanwhile, 25-year-old playmaker Lalrindika had a productive season for debutants Inter Kashi, scoring four and providing eight assists.With veteran defender Sandesh Jhingan missing the vital qualifiers with injury, Real Kashmir centre-back Hummad could be an important addition to realise India's dreams.Stimac's commitment to finding recruits in the attacking department was also proved by the inclusion of four new faces to accompany veteran Sunil Chhetri and Rahim Ali as India's strike force.The northeast's continuing role as supply line saw one more player from the seven states to join the three debutants from Mizoram as Assam and NorthEast United FC 's Parthib Gogoi got a chance to prove his mettle after a couple of top-class goals in Indian Super League .His NEUFC teammate Jithin MS, too, was gifted with an opportunity for his four goals and three assists as Stimac looked to have paid heed to his critics with an interesting list of young new faces with dreams to shine for India.A final list is expected after Indian Super League final on Saturday with players from the finalists club missing from the first list of probables that will take on Kuwait in Kolkata on June 6 before travelling to face Qatar in Doha on June 11.The squad: Goalkeepers: Amrinder Singh, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu; Defenders: Amey Ganesh Ranawade, Jay Gupta, Lalchungnunga, Muhammad Hammad, Narender, Nikhil Poojary, Roshan Singh Naorem; Midfielders: Brandon Fernandes, Edmund Lalrindika, Imran Khan, Isak Vanlalruatfela, Jeakson Singh Thounaojam, Mahesh Singh Naorem, Mohammad Yasir, Nandhakumar Sekar, Rahul Kannoly Praveen, Suresh Singh Wangjam, Vibin Mohanan; Forwards: David Lalhlansanga, Jithin Madathil Subran, Lalrinzuala, Parthib Sundar Gogoi, Rahim Ali, Sunil Chhetri","Mohammedan SC's Indian top scorer David Lalhlansanga, Aizawl FC striker Lalrinzuala Lalbiaknia, Inter Kashi midfielder Edmund Lalrindika and Real Kashmir defender Muhammad Hammad called for the four-week camp in Bhubaneswar starting on Friday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109852202,imgsize-11402,width-400,resizemode-4/109852202.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Atletico Madrid took a step closer to securing a Champions League spot with a 1-0 victory against Mallorca in LaLiga on Saturday, thanks to an early goal from winger Rodrigo Riquelme .With only four matches left to play, Diego Simeone 's team sits in fourth place with 67 points, maintaining a six-point lead over fifth-placed Athletic Bilbao.Earlier on Saturday, Real Madrid clinched their record-extending 36th LaLiga title after Girona's comeback win against Barcelona , with a score of 4-2.This result gave Carlo Ancelotti's side an unbeatable lead in the standings. Real Madrid defeated Cadiz and now hold a 13-point advantage over second-placed Girona, while Barcelona slipped to third with 73 points.The match at Son Moix stadium had a lackadaisical atmosphere, with both teams displaying a lack of intensity in a largely uneventful game. The only notable moment came in the fifth minute when Riquelme scored a brilliant individual goal to secure the win for the visitors. He seized a loose ball at the edge of the box, evaded two defenders, and struck an unstoppable shot just inside the right post.Atleti's Axel Witsel emphasized the importance of the win, stating, ""It was very important to win.

KOLKATA: The referee's final whistle was yet to be blown but Lallianzuala Chhangte briefly came over to the Mumbai City FC bench and kissed the crest of his jersey. A couple of his teammates came out of their seats to bow down to him in deference.The packed stands of 62,000 had fallen silent by that time.It was Mohun Bagan SG's heartbreak and Mumbai City FC's hurrah. It was Chhangte's night.In a team game, Mumbai City's No. 7 painted the Salt Lake Stadium's canvass with one of the finest individual performances this season, guiding his team to a remarkable 3-1 win over Mohun Bagan to lift the ISL championship title and denying Antonio Lopez Habas 's Shield winners an opportunity of doing a 'double' in the league.Chhangte, who finished the league with 10 goals - the maximum among domestic players - didn't score this time. But such was his elegant menace that he almost single-handedly brought crowd favourites Mohun Bagan to their knees. His acceleration, vision and endless determination were too much for the home team. He simply eviscerated the opponents.Mumbai City started with such intensity that Chhengte was denied by the woodwork twice in the first half. Yet, the fickle hand of football seemed to turn the script on its head in a stunning way when Jason Cummings put Mohun Bagan ahead in the 44th minute in what was the team's second shot on target at that time.But Petr Kratky 's Mumbai - having certainly learnt from their Shield-losing defeat here three weeks ago - continued to control the game with their passing and possession and always looked threatening on the break. The equalizer came in the 53rd minute through Jorge Pereyra Diaz .Mumbai soon lost Pereyra Diaz and Alberto Noguera to injury. But their substitutes Bipin Singh and Jakub Vojtus rose to the occasion, scoring in the 81st and 95th minute, respectively, giving Mumbai the deserved victory.While Mumbai players sang and danced with the cup, the result also put a question mark on Habas's strategy. They missed the usual creativity, and the likes of Manvir Singh, Liston Colaco and Dimitri Petratos were not given the license to set the tempo until the final 15 minutes when they decided to throw the kitchen sink in desperation.Mumbai started on the front foot, flourishing in Petr Kratky's pass-and-move doctrine and leaving Mohun Bagan all over the place. The imperious Chhangte - the winger with exceptional work rate - was the heartbeat of their relentless pressure on the Bagan box.Soon after Chhangte saw his lay-off across the goalline go begging, he came calling again, this time his looping shot hit the crosspiece.The woodwork came to Bagan's rescue again when, receiving the ball from Vikram Pratap Singh, Chhangte took aim at the goal, the ball coming back into play after hitting the far post.The storm was heavy but Bagan somehow managed to weather it for a while, and then added a twist to the tale out of nowhere.Two minutes after Liston Colaco fired Bagan's first shot on target in the match, the Bagan winger initiated another move just on the cusp of halftime, with his usual brisk pace down the left flank. Petratos, receiving the ball from him, unleashed a ferocious strike from the edge of the box. Mumbai goalkeeper Phurba Lachenpa could only manage to block it but Cummings --just like the semifinal second-leg clash against Odisha FC here six days ago --reacted the quickest to slam home the rebound.But Mumbai came back and stole the home team's thunder with a remarkable second-half performance.","Mumbai City FC beat Mohun Bagan 3-1 to lift ISL championship title. Lallianzuala Chhangte scored 10 league goals, the maximum among domestic players. Jason Cummings put Bagan ahead in 44th minute. Jorge Pereyra Diaz equalized for Mumbai in 53rd minute. Substitutes Bipin Singh and Jakub Vojtus scored in 81st and 95th minute respectively.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109852047,imgsize-179462,width-400,resizemode-4/109852047.jpg"
