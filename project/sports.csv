We had 24 patients there; 11 in the trauma ICU and 13 in the semi-ICU. A short circuit occurred in the trauma ICU, and the fire spread rapidly, releasing toxic gases,” he said.Dhakad added that most of the patients in the ICU were comatose. “Our trauma centre team, our nursing officers, and ward boys, immediately rescued them on trolleys and brought as many patients as we could out of the ICU and shifted them to another location.Six of those patients were very critical; we tried very hard to revive them with CPR, but they couldn't be saved,” he said.According to Dhakad, two of the deceased were women and four were men. Five patients are still critical. “There were 24 that we evacuated: 11 in the trauma ICU and 13 in the adjacent ICU,” he said.Also read - Doctors, compounders fled as smoke spread, say kin; CM reviews situation at SMS trauma centre Authorities are investigating the cause of the short circuit and assessing damage to the facility.

He was about to recover and was scheduled to be discharged in two-three days. ""Jogendra Singh alleged negligence by hospital staff. ""My mother was admitted to the ICU. When the spark occurred, I alerted the doctors four to five times that it was coming from there, but they dismissed it as normal. Suddenly, smoke engulfed the area, and all the staff ran out, leaving no one to help or save my mother. I was outside when I asked the police, and they said everyone had been evacuated.

""I had just arrived this evening. I rushed to the hospital, but initially, they wouldn't let me inside. After some time, I managed to enter. When I went in, I found my brother dead,"" he was quoted as saying by the news agency ANI.","A fire broke out at the trauma ICU of Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital late on Sunday night.

Brett Phillips: A career built on heart and hustle



Numbers that tell Brett Phillips' story



Brett Phillips, the fan-favorite outfielder known for his infectious energy and clutch moments, has officially announced his retirement from professional baseball. In a heartfelt post on Instagram, the 31-year-old shared his gratitude for the sport, his teammates, and fans, marking the end of an illustrious journey in MLB.Phillips first broke into the majors in 2017, quickly earning a reputation not only for his athletic skill but for his electric personality both on and off the field. His most iconic moment came during the 2020 World Series, when his game-winning hit for the Tampa Bay Rays became an instant classic. That play cemented his place in baseball lore and showcased the spirit that defined his career.In his Instagram announcement, Phillips wrote, “To my teammates, as I look back on my career I can say with certainty that you all made my time in professional baseball the most fun and I appreciate each and every one of you for how you treated and welcomed me, thank you!""Beyond his on-field heroics, Phillips was celebrated for his approachable nature. His lighthearted moments, from playful interviews to engaging with fans during games, made him one of the sport’s most relatable figures. Players like him remind us that baseball is more than numbers and trophiesOver his eight-year major league career, Phillips played for five teams: the Milwaukee Brewers, Kansas City Royals, Tampa Bay Rays, Baltimore Orioles, and Los Angeles Angels. He appeared in 397 games, recorded 23 home runs, and drove in 79 RBIs with a career batting average of .188. Although his offensive numbers were modest, Phillips carved out a niche with his outstanding defense—posting a lifetime fielding percentage above .985—and his speed and versatility across the outfield.What separated him, however, was his ability to deliver when it mattered most. His 2020 postseason heroics earned him a place in baseball history, and his fearless diving catches and cannon-like arm routinely made highlight reels. Phillips also became known for his humor and humility, connecting with fans through lighthearted interviews and viral moments, from fake mound visits to playful celebrations.Also Read: Chaos hits Red October as Bryce Harper's family expands with fourth child ahead of NLDS","Brett Phillips announced his retirement from professional baseball on Instagram.

Why are the Buffalo Bills wearing their bold all-white ‘Cold Front’ uniforms against the Patriots tonight?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-are-the-buffalo-bills-wearing-their-bold-all-white-cold-front-uniforms-against-the-patriots-tonight/articleshow/124328077.cms,"Buffalo Bills white-on-white 'Cold Front' jerseys vs. Patriots (X/Buffalo Bills)

Why the Bills chose the ‘Cold Front’ jerseys



Bills embrace heritage and hype with new Rivalries look



The Buffalo Bills brought a chill to Sunday Night Football — even with clear skies overhead. Against the New England Patriots, the Bills debuted their brand-new “Cold Front” uniforms, turning Highmark Stadium into a snowstorm of white. It was more than just a look; it was a statement, one that celebrated Buffalo’s frozen identity and passionate fan base in true Bills fashion.The “Cold Front” design is part of the NFL’s new Rivalries uniform series — a collaboration with Nike that lets teams highlight their culture, heritage, and spirit through unique alternate looks. For the Bills, that meant leaning into what defines them most: winter.Created over two years with Nike, the icy white-on-white uniforms feature frosted silver details and subtle snow-inspired textures. The helmet showcases a white base with a silver charging buffalo outlined in cool blue, while the shoulders are adorned with raised logos resembling icicles. The entire ensemble swaps Buffalo’s signature red for a wintry mix of white, silver, and ice blue.“It’s a cold front coming through Buffalo,” a team insider joked before kickoff — fitting, since fans were invited to join in the spectacle. Each spectator was encouraged to dress in white, with rally towels waved across the stands to create a snow-globe effect under primetime lights.Though it was 80 degrees in Orchard Park earlier in the day, by kickoff, the atmosphere inside Highmark felt like January football — crisp, electric, and undeniably Buffalo.This uniform debut also holds special meaning: it’s the Bills’ final season in their current stadium. To mark the occasion, they’re rotating through three alternate looks this year — the “Cold Front” set, their classic throwback standing buffalo design, and a red helmet tribute to the 1990s Super Bowl era.The “Cold Front” is more than a marketing move. It’s an embrace of Buffalo’s identity — a team and a city that thrives in the cold, bonded by resilience and pride. As snow often defines the Bills’ late-season battles, these new uniforms embody that same toughness, reminding everyone that in Buffalo, the weather isn’t a challenge — it’s part of who they are.If the Bills can top the Patriots in their icy new look, this “Cold Front” might just become a fan favorite for years to come.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s $350K Italian-inspired birthday surprise for Travis Kelce remains one of her most extravagant romantic gestures yet","The Buffalo Bills debuted their new ""Cold Front"" uniforms against the New England Patriots.

The New York Giants might have hit a pause with Russell Wilson’s trade talks



Russell Wilson remains supportive of the New York Giants even after being benched



Russell Wilson’s situation with the New York Giants has become complicated ever since he was benched for rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart a few days ago.

Amid this, NFL insider Jonathan Jones of CBS Sports has shared an update on speculations of Russell Wilson being traded.A few hours ago, Jonathan Jones of CBS Sports wrote, “The Giants have not actively shopped Wilson since benching him in Week 4, sources say, but the league at large understands he could be dealt.”He added, “The acquiring team would owe Wilson only the prorated portion of his $2 million base salary while giving up what sources believe would be a Day 3 draft pick…”However, neither the New York Giants nor Russell Wilson has commented on the trade speculations that have begun ever since he got benched.Despite the trolling and outrage, the NFL veteran Russell Wilson, has remained pretty positive and supportive of his team, the New York Giants.A few days ago, the 37 year old NFL veteran was asked about being benched as he said, “I’m focused on helping this team win…I’m focused on helping Jaxson. . . . I want to be here.”Russell Wilson added, “I love this organization, I love the process of it all. I love the guys in the locker room.I’m not giving up on us and this season.”Out of the four matches played in the new season so far, the New York Giants have only managed to win in only one match against the Los Angeles Chargers.This has sparked concern and panic among fans even though it seems the team has remained positive about a win against the New Orleans Saints tonight as Jaxson Dart takes the field.Also Read: Will Josh Allen play against the New England Patriots tonight?

Why Mark Kastelic charged at Matt Rempe

What really happened in Boston Bruins vs New York Rangers game

During the preseason matchup between the Boston Bruins and the New York Rangers, a key confrontation unfolded between forward Mark Kastelic and Rangers forward Matt Rempe. This incident happened in the last preseason game ahead of the Bruins' regular season debut.At the conclusion of the first period in Boston's last preseason game against New York at TD Garden. This was the Bruins' final rehearsal before their season opener on Wednesday, October 8, 2025.Kastelic started the brawl after both players left the penalty box, charging at Rempe with only five seconds left in the period. This was triggered by their earlier argument and penalties, as they ""got after it again"" immediately upon release.Kastelic's move was a testament to his character as a gritty forward who stands his ground, even when he's at a disadvantage in height (6-foot-4 vs. 6-foot-9), weight (234 pounds vs. 261 pounds), and reach compared to Rempe.As a new member of the Bruins after a June 2024 trade from the Ottawa Senators that involved goaltender Linus Ullmark, Kastelic has made it clear that he takes pride in bottom-six roles that require toughness and penalty killing.Kastelic mentioned to the press at Warrior Ice Arena, ""Who won the bout? Probably him,"" talking about a previous match with his current teammate Jeannot, showcasing his readiness to take on challenging rivals.This incident happened after a bunch of physical plays. Bruins forward Tanner Jeannot executed a clean hit on Rangers defenseman Braden Schneider. Then, Kastelic and Rempe got into a verbal spat, leading to coincidental two-minute penalties for unsportsmanlike conduct with 2:33 to go in the period.These penalties were described as ""ticky-tacky off-setting penalties"" The Bruins seemed to have their sights set on Rempe early on, with Jeannot slamming him into the boards and Kastelic pushing him around on the following shift.This physicality is in line with earlier preseason games between the teams. On September 22, 2024, during a preseason match, a brawl broke out involving Kastelic and other players such as Victor Mancini, Brennan Othmann, and Parker Wotherspoon near the Rangers' net. Kastelic was eager to play physically in that game, but he didn't end up fighting.In the scuffle, both players were busy blocking each other's arms, and neither of them landed any direct hits at the start. As they twirled down to the ice, Rempe landed a couple of grazing punches on the back of Kastelic's helmet. The fight was noted as ""basically a draw"" in an X post noting Rempe landed more punches. The Bruins had their first fight of the preseason here. Kastelic is known for his fighting history, which includes a bout with Connor Mackey.Fans have given all sorts of reaction on this incident. One user in particular said, ""Just waive him and let him get claimed. The Rangers org made enough money off him, time to cut our losses on the hockey end of things. Dude just cant keep up with NHL skill"".After seeing this, one user made fun of both of those by saying, ""Both useless players"" to which another user replied, ""Way more useful as people than you though"". One thing is sure that this incident has sure got people hooked.Mark Kastelic proved he's ready to rise to the challenge, holding his own even when facing a much larger rival.Also Read: Kirill Kaprizov’s net worth in 2025: How his record-breaking Minnesota Wild contract could skyrocket his fortune","Boston Bruins forward Mark Kastelic charged at New York Rangers forward Matt Rempe.

India secured a commanding 88-run victory over Pakistan in the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup 2025 at the R. Premadasa International Cricket Stadium in Colombo on Sunday.The win extended India's unbeaten record against Pakistan to 12-0 in ODIs under the leadership of Harmanpreet Kaur The match proceeded with expected patterns, though notably without the usual hostilities. India maintained their ""no-handshake"" policy at the toss and after the match, following the precedent from the men's Asia Cup in the UAE.The game featured some unexpected moments, including a toss mishap, an unusual run out, and a 15-minute delay due to bugs on the field.""Very happy, very important game for all of us, and I'm sure everyone back home is happy as well,"" Harmanpreet said at the post-match presentation.India batted first after being sent in and posted 247 runs before being dismissed. Harleen Deol contributed 46 runs while Richa Ghosh added a quick 35, though most batters struggled to convert their starts on the slow pitch.""It wasn't an easy pitch to bat on, we wanted to bat longer and see how many runs we can get. It wasn't an easy pitch. It's been raining, and there was a hold on the pitch. We wanted to keep wickets in hand.The key was keeping wickets, Richa batted really well and gave us that crucial 30 runs,"" Harmanpreet said.Pakistan's chase began poorly as they lost three early wickets, falling to 26 for 3 by the eighth over. They were eventually bowled out for 159 in 43 overs.Sidra Amin stood out for Pakistan with a fighting 81 runs off 106 balls, while Natalia Pervaiz contributed 33 runs.India's bowling attack proved effective with Kranti Goud taking 3/20 and Deepti Sharma claiming 3/45. Shree Charani also contributed with 2/38.""Our bowling was great. Kranti bowled really well, she was outstanding and Renuka helped her in getting the breakthroughs. We created so many chances, unfortunately, we dropped it, but in the end when you win you are happy,"" Harmanpreet said.""There are a lot of areas but we are happy we won, just want to go with the momentum.

'Can't tell that on camera': Tilak Varma on heated moments during Asia Cup final vs Pakistan

Poll Do you believe that cricket should be separated from political tensions? Absolutely Not really

Former England captain Michael Atherton has called on the International Cricket Council (ICC) to increase transparency in its tournament draw system, suggesting a reduction in India-Pakistan matches. His comments follow the controversies during the 2025 Asia Cup The recent men's Asian tournament was marked by political undertones, influenced by the terror attack and border conflicts between the two nations. Both the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) were involved in these disputes.India and Pakistan have consistently been placed in the same group at ICC events for many years. The ICC's group selection process remains largely unexplained, unlike other major sporting tournaments.The cricket governing body reportedly ensures these teams share the same group to guarantee at least one India-Pakistan match per tournament. The Asia Cup takes this further, with its format designed to potentially create three such matches within a month, as seen in the latest edition.The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) relies heavily on the revenue from these matches to support grassroots cricket development in the region, making it a complex issue to address.""Despite its scarcity (maybe, in part, because of its scarcity) it is a fixture that carries huge economic clout, one of the main reasons why the broadcast rights for ICC tournaments are worth so much — roughly $3 billion for the most recent rights cycle (in) 2023-27,"" Atherton wrote in his column for The Times. ""Due to the relative decline in the value of bilateral matches, ICC events have grown in frequency and importance, and so the India and Pakistan fixture is crucial to the balance sheets of those who would not otherwise have any skin in the game. """"If cricket was once the vehicle for diplomacy, it is now, clearly, a proxy for broader tensions and for propaganda. There is little justification, in any case, for a serious sport to arrange tournament fixtures to suit its economic needs and now that the rivalry is being exploited in other ways, there is even less justification for it. For the next broadcast rights cycle, the fixture draw before ICC events should be transparent and if the two teams do not meet every time, so be it,"" Atherton added.These matches between India and Pakistan generate significant economic value, particularly for ICC tournaments. The broadcasting rights for these events command substantial fees, with the current cycle (2023-27) valued at approximately $3 billion.Recent events at the Asia Cup have highlighted the increasing intersection of cricket and geopolitics between these nations. The tournament saw multiple controversies and political statements from both sides.","Former England captain Michael Atherton has called on the International Cricket Council to increase transparency in its tournament draw system.

Currently, they only participate in bilateral ODIs, which have seen a reduction in frequency due to commercial factors, along with the IPL T20 tournament.""Rohit and Virat want to play the 2027 World Cup, but game fitness will be a big challenge for them. Rohit has worked well on his fitness. He is focused on that. But there is regular fitness, and game time fitness… If you are not playing regular cricket, both of them have to ensure some game time. They have to play domestic cricket,"" Pathan said on his YouTube channel.""They are big players and know what to do. They have all the experience in the world. But they are not even playing T20Is, so there will be big gaps between the few matches that they play before the big World Cup. They will need regular game time to be fit for that. Only then will their dream to play the 2027 World Cup come true.""The upcoming ODI tour of Australia will mark the beginning of Gill's captaincy.Following this, India's domestic season will commence in winter, featuring the Vijay Hazare Trophy, the country's premier List-A tournament. Neither Kohli nor Rohit has participated in this domestic competition for several years.""There is a leadership change; Gill will lead in both formats now.

Pakistan's fast bowler Diana Baig has confirmed that the confusion surrounding Muneeba Ali 's controversial run-out against India in Colombo has been resolved.The Women's World Cup match between India and Pakistan on Sunday was marked by controversy. The unusual incident occurred during Pakistan's chase of 248 runs.In the fourth over's final delivery, Indian players appealed for an lbw against Muneeba off Kranti Gaud's bowling, which the on-field umpire denied.Muneeba had secured her position by grounding her bat behind the crease. Deepti Sharma then threw the ball from slip, hitting the stumps. At that moment, Muneeba lifted her bat without any part of her body behind the crease.The third umpire's conflicting decisions displayed on the big screen created confusion among players and spectators. The initial verdict was not out, causing Indian players to return to their positions. The decision was then changed to out, surprising Muneeba and triggering celebrations among Indian players.""Muneeba's run-out issue has already been settled, I believe. I don't want to talk much about it now. Whatever happened and whatever the situation was, I think it has been resolved,"" Diana stated after Pakistan's 88-run loss.After being given out for 2 runs off 12 balls, Muneeba sought clarification from the on-field umpires. She paused while walking back after receiving instructions from the team dugout.Muneeba remained on the field while Pakistan captain Fatima Sana discussed the situation with fourth umpire Kim Cotton. The captain then signaled Muneeba to leave, ending the several-minute delay.The ICC Playing Condition 30.1.2 states: ""However, a batter shall not be considered to be out of his ground if, in running or diving towards his ground and beyond, and having grounded some part of his person or bat beyond the popping crease, there is subsequent loss of contact between the ground and any part of his person or bat, or between the bat and person.""This incident caused significant discussion during the match between the rival teams.

Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan made an eye-catching post on his social media to celebrate India's victory over arch-rivals Pakistan in the Women's ODI World Cup on Sunday.“Just another Sunday of Eat. Sleep. Win. Repeat. Team India ,” wrote Pathan on X, capturing the mood of Indian fans after yet another convincing win over their noisy neighbours.For the fourth consecutive Sunday, India emerged victorious against their arch-rivals, three times in the Asia Cup (including a final) and now in the Women’s World Cup, continuing their dominance in cricket’s most emotionally charged rivalry.At Colombo’s R. Premadasa Stadium, India’s women secured a commanding 88-run win, but the match was overshadowed by tension that simmered both on and off the field.The traditional post-match handshake was notably absent, as players from both sides walked straight to their dressing rooms after the final ball.Even before play began, captains Harmanpreet Kaur and Fatima Sana skipped the customary handshake at the toss, a sign of the frosty relations between the two camps.Controversy erupted right from the toss when Sana’s call of “tails” was misheard as “heads,” mistakenly awarding Pakistan the toss.The confusion was only the start of a drama-filled day. Soon after, Pakistan opener Muneeba Ali was bizarrely run out after stepping out of her crease following an LBW review — her bat airborne when the bails were removed, leading to heated protests.Despite the tension, India stayed composed. Harleen Deol anchored the innings with a steady 46, while Richa Ghosh provided late fireworks, smashing 35 off 20 balls to lift India to 247. Pakistan’s Diana Baig bowled valiantly for her 4/69, but it wasn’t enough.In reply, Pakistan faltered early and never recovered. India’s spinners — Deepti Sharma and Sneh Rana — shared five wickets, and Kranti Goud’s fiery three-wicket burst sealed the deal.Only Sidra Amin’s graceful 81 offered resistance, but she lacked support as Pakistan crumbled.With this win, India climbed to the top of the table, while Pakistan remain winless — another Sunday, another Indian celebration.","India beat Pakistan by 88 runs in the Women's ODI World Cup in Sri Lanka.

Jack Eichel’s next contract could shatter Mitch Marner’s $96 million benchmark



Kirill Kaprizov Secures the Bag | 32 Thoughts

What Eichel’s next contract means for Vegas and the NHL



The buzz surrounding Jack Eichel is reaching a fever pitch as the Vegas Golden Knights head into a defining offseason. The franchise’s top center, now entering the final year of his eight-year, $80 million contract, has become the focal point of one of the NHL’s most talked-about negotiations. League insiders suggest Eichel could soon sign a deal that not only cements his place among hockey’s elite but potentially eclipses Mitch Marner’s record-setting $96 million contract.During a recent episode of the 32 Thoughts podcast, NHL insider Elliotte Friedman offered intriguing insights into how Vegas views its franchise star. “I heard that in the summer, when they signed Marner, they knew that Eichel was going to go past him,” Friedman shared. “They recognized Eichel as a number-one center, a Stanley Cup player, and a hugely valuable piece for them.”Eichel’s performance speaks volumes. Coming off a season where he recorded 94 points in 77 games, the 27-year-old continues to prove he’s one of the league’s most complete offensive forces. Analysts believe Vegas is prepared to reward that dominance with a deal exceeding $96 million, with annual figures potentially stretching beyond $13 million.Another factor working in Eichel’s favor is geography. Nevada’s lack of state income tax gives the Golden Knights an edge that few teams can match. “I think Eichel knows he’s not going to get to 17,” Friedman noted, “but where’s the sweet spot? Vegas being a no-tax state makes higher numbers possible compared to markets like Minnesota.”Eichel’s potential extension represents far more than a blockbuster payday — it’s a defining moment for both the player and the franchise. Since arriving in Vegas, he’s become the face of their offensive identity, leading by example and anchoring a championship-caliber roster.General manager Kelly McCrimmon has made it clear that re-signing Eichel is a top organizational priority. The forward’s consistency, leadership, and elite playmaking make him indispensable as Vegas looks to extend its Stanley Cup window.Should Eichel’s next deal surpass Marner’s $96 million mark, it would not only reaffirm the Golden Knights’ aggressive pursuit of excellence but also set a new standard across the NHL. In a league driven by parity and tight salary caps, Eichel’s upcoming contract could redefine how teams value — and pay — their true franchise centers.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Sidney Crosby reportedly on one team’s radar as they plan to do whatever it takes to acquire him","Jack Eichel could soon sign a deal that potentially eclipses Mitch Marner’s record-setting $96 million contract.

Carolina Hurricanes claim Brandon Bussi to strengthen goaltending pipeline

Cayden Primeau placed on waivers amid Hurricanes’ roster shuffle

The Carolina Hurricanes have bolstered their goaltending depth by claiming Brandon Bussi off waivers from the Florida Panthers. The move provides additional insurance between the pipes as the Hurricanes prepare for the upcoming 2025–26 NHL season. The team also placed goaltender Cayden Primeau on waivers, aiming to assign him to the AHL’s Chicago Wolves if he goes unclaimed.Brandon Bussi, 27, joins the Carolina Hurricanes after being signed by the Florida Panthers earlier this summer to a one-year, two-way contract worth $775,000 in the NHL and $400,000 in the AHL. The Sound Beach, New York native posted solid numbers last season with the Boston Bruins’ AHL affiliate, the Providence Bruins, recording a 15-14-4 record, a .907 save percentage, and a 2.77 goals-against average in 33 games.Bussi’s consistency stood out as he tied for third in the AHL with five shutouts while sharing the net with Michael DiPietro, who also recently hit waivers. Over four AHL seasons, Bussi has compiled a .915 save percentage and 2.61 goals-against average in 111 career regular-season games. A product of Western Michigan University, where he played three seasons from 2019 to 2022, Bussi has been regarded as a steady presence with upside potential.To make room for Bussi, the Hurricanes placed Cayden Primeau on waivers, hoping to assign him to the AHL’s Chicago Wolves. Primeau, who was acquired from the Montreal Canadiens during the offseason, was expected to start as the Wolves’ No. 1 goaltender. The 26-year-old has 55 NHL appearances, all with Montreal, and finished the 2024–25 AHL season with a strong 21-2-3 record and impressive consistency with Laval.With Frederik Andersen and Pyotr Kochetkov leading Carolina’s NHL goaltending tandem, Bussi’s arrival offers much-needed depth behind them. The Hurricanes also have Ruslan Khazyeyev, Amir Miftakhov, and Nikita Quapp developing within their North American system.The Carolina Hurricanes’ decision to claim Brandon Bussi underscores their commitment to maintaining depth and stability in goal. As they prepare to open their season against the New Jersey Devils, the addition of Bussi provides valuable insurance for a team with high expectations entering the 2025–26 campaign.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Montreal Canadiens prospect Joshua Roy could be on the trade market","The Carolina Hurricanes have claimed goaltender Brandon Bussi off waivers from the Florida Panthers.

A devastating setback for the Chargers ’ offense

Chargers look for answers with Hassan Haskins and Kimani Vidal stepping in

Los Angeles Chargers rookie running back Omarion Hampton’s impressive early-season momentum came to a halt Sunday after he exited the game against the Washington Commanders with an ankle injury. The 22nd overall pick, who had quickly emerged as a key offensive weapon, did not return to the field, leaving fans and coaches anxious about his status.Omarion Hampton’s injury comes at a particularly tough time for Los Angeles. Already dealing with major absences along the offensive line including left tackle Rashawn Slater (knee) and Joe Alt (ankle) the Chargers are running thin on healthy starters. Hampton had been one of the few bright spots in an offense struggling for consistency, stepping up after Najee Harris suffered a season-ending Achilles injury earlier this year.Over the past two weeks, the North Carolina standout had proven himself as a dynamic, all-purpose back. In Week 3, Hampton recorded 129 yards from scrimmage and scored his first career touchdown during a thrilling comeback win over the Denver Broncos. He followed that performance with another breakout game in Week 4 against the New York Giants, amassing 165 yards and a touchdown on just 15 touches, a performance that solidified his role as the new offensive focal point.With Hampton sidelined, the Chargers turned to Hassan Haskins and Kimani Vidal to fill the void. Haskins, who played under head coach Jim Harbaugh at Michigan, brings familiarity with Harbaugh’s system, while Vidal, a sixth-round pick from last season, made his first appearance of the year. While both backs bring promise, neither possesses Hampton’s burst or versatility, which had made him a nightmare for opposing defenses.For the Chargers, the timing of this injury couldn’t be worse.

Mark Sanchez ’s Hollywood connections before finding lasting love

Mark Sanchez Smelled of Alcohol Before Violent Knife Fight; Now Hit With Multiple Charges

A string of short romances before finding stability

Former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez has once again made headlines but this time, it’s not for his plays on the field. Following his recent hospitalization after a stabbing incident in Indianapolis, fans are revisiting the retired New York Jets star’s past, particularly his high-profile dating history that once made him one of Hollywood’s most talked-about bachelors.Before his marriage to In the Dark actress Perry Mattfeld, Sanchez’s love life was a recurring tabloid favorite. The two first began dating in 2017, got engaged in 2022, and tied the knot in an intimate 2023 ceremony in Oaxaca, Mexico. Sanchez described the wedding as “emotional” and said he felt “overwhelmed with joy and gratitude,” a far cry from his younger, headline-grabbing days.Back in 2012, Sanchez dated Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria. Their relationship was short-lived, with Page Six reporting that their demanding schedules and his grueling NFL season made it “hard to keep things going.” Just a year earlier, the quarterback was romantically linked to supermodel Kate Upton after several late-night visits to her New York apartment. Though Upton never confirmed the fling, she playfully deflected questions by telling reporters, “What do you think?”Around the same time, Sanchez was spotted with actress Hayden Panettiere, though she later clarified to Us Weekly that they were “just friends.”Before his Hollywood streak, Sanchez dated The Sopranos star Jamie-Lynn Sigler in 2010, but the two parted ways after only a few months. Friends close to the pair claimed Sigler wanted a more serious relationship, while Sanchez was focused on his career. That same year, he was rumored to be dating sports reporter Lindsay McCormick, who quickly shut down speculation, calling him “an acquaintance and a friend.”His earliest known romance was with model Hilary Rhoda in 2009, following a GQ photo shoot though the relationship ended when Rhoda began seeing hockey player Sean Avery.Also Read: Who is Mark Sanchez?

“Tom yells at the kids”: Tom Brady’s biggest career scandal reportedly became the final straw for Gisele Bündchen,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-yells-at-the-kids-tom-bradys-biggest-career-scandal-reportedly-became-the-final-straw-for-gisele-bndchen/articleshow/124319726.cms,"Tom Brady & Gisele Bündchen (Getty Images)

The scandal that tested both Tom Brady ’s career and his marriage

How therapy couldn’t save the Tom Brady-Gisele Bündchen relationship

Tom Brady may be celebrated as the greatest quarterback in NFL history, but even the GOAT’s career came with turbulence that bled into his personal life. While fans remember the Deflategate scandal as one of the most controversial moments in sports history, few knew it also created deep cracks in his marriage to Gisele Bündchen, a relationship that once appeared unshakable.In January 2015, Brady’s New England Patriots were accused of using underinflated footballs during the AFC Championship Game against the Indianapolis Colts, a matchup the Patriots dominated 45–7 before ultimately winning the Super Bowl. The NFL investigation that followed was relentless, leading to Brady’s four-game suspension and a $1 million fine for the Patriots.Behind the scenes, however, the quarterback’s troubles extended far beyond the field. According to Radar Online, the stress from the investigation took a toll on Brady’s family life. “When Tom’s had a busy day of training, he’ll come home and pass out on the couch,” an insider revealed. “There’s a lack of effort, for sure, but what annoys Gisele more is when Tom yells at the kids for behaving badly during the time he does spend with them. She feels he should be more patient.”The report added that the couple entered therapy as tensions rose, with Gisele reportedly giving Brady an ultimatum to address his behavior.While Brady initially resisted counseling, he ultimately agreed but not without complications. A source claimed, “The truth is, his career was on the line, and his wife was sneaking around Paris in a burqa getting plastic surgery. The therapist noted that both of them tend to put Gisele’s needs over his.”Though the sessions seemed to stabilize his mindset and help him refocus on football, leading to three more Super Bowl titles, their emotional disconnect deepened.By 2022, the couple divorced after 13 years of marriage. Since then, Brady has been linked to model Irina Shayk, while Gisele has moved on with her jiu-jitsu instructor, Joaquim Valente, with whom she welcomed a son in 2025.Also Read: “Get off and get your responsibilities done”: Tom Brady triggers controversy with blunt take on parenting Benjamin and Vivian Even years later, Deflategate remains more than just a football scandal, it’s remembered as the moment that changed the Brady-Bündchen fairytale forever.",Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen divorced in 2022 after 13 years of marriage.

Stefon Diggs’ iconic Bills No. 14 jersey gets a new owner — Who is Tyrell Shavers?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/stefon-diggs-iconic-bills-no-14-jersey-gets-a-new-owner-who-is-tyrell-shavers/articleshow/124328205.cms,"Stefon Diggs & Tyrell Shavers (Getty Images)

Tyrell Shavers steps into the spotlight wearing Stefon Diggs’ old number

Bills fans compare eras as Stefon Diggs returns to Buffalo

For years, Stefon Diggs defined the Buffalo Bills’ offense and his No. 14 jersey became a fan favorite across western New York. But now, as Diggs prepares to face his former team in a Patriots uniform, a new player is wearing the number that once symbolized Buffalo’s explosive passing game: Tyrell Shavers.The Bills’ decision to give away Diggs’ number wasn’t just symbolic, it represented a shift toward developing fresh offensive talent. Shavers, a 6-foot-4 wide receiver, brings a very different skill set to the table. Known for his size, reach, and athleticism, he offers quarterback Josh Allen a new kind of target, especially in red-zone situations where height and physicality matter most.Shavers, who played college football at Alabama, Mississippi State, and San Diego State, has taken the long road to earn his place on Buffalo’s roster. His breakout moment came in the final preseason game, when he made a spectacular one-handed grab that turned heads across the organization. That play helped cement his spot on the 53-man roster and hinted at his untapped potential.Last season, Shavers had just one catch, but it was a memorable one: a 69-yard touchdown. This year, he’s slowly earning more opportunities, with two catches for 24 yards so far.The emotional layer to Shavers’ emergence is that his first major spotlight comes as Diggs returns to Buffalo wearing enemy colors.When the Patriots take the field on Sunday Night Football, fans will see two players wearing No. 14 — one representing the past, the other the future.It’s a poetic full circle for Bills fans, many of whom are curious to see whether Shavers can eventually carve out his own legacy with the same number. If he shines under the lights against New England, that No. 14 jersey might start selling again, this time with a new name stitched across the back.As one fan joked online, “Maybe we won’t need to burn our old Diggs jerseys — just re-label them Shavers.”Also Read: Chiefs face setback as Xavier Worthy’s injury status clouds Monday night showdown against Jaguars","Tyrell Shavers, a 6-foot-4 wide receiver, has taken the long road to earn his place on Buffalo’s roster.

Chiefs send priceless gifts after Mahomes ’ headband theft goes viral



From online outrage to heartfelt redemption



A 10-year-old boy’s special birthday moment took an unexpected turn when Patrick Mahomes ’ game-worn headband meant for him was snatched away by another fan. But the Kansas City Chiefs stepped in to turn his heartbreak into pure joy — sending him a surprise package that proved why the team’s heart goes beyond the field.What began as a dream night at MetLife Stadium for young Chiefs fan Joey Masters turned sour in seconds. The New York native, celebrating his 10th birthday, watched in awe as his idol Patrick Mahomes approached the stands after Kansas City’s 22-9 win over the Giants. Mahomes tried handing him his headband, but a woman — later identified as Nina Miller — reached over and took it instead.The incident, captured on video, spread across social media, leaving fans furious and Joey visibly heartbroken. “Patrick Mahomes walked over to me, locked eyes with me, tries to give me his headband and the woman just swoops in and snatches it from me,” Joey told KCTV5.When the clip caught the attention of Tavia Hunt, wife of Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, she immediately took to Instagram asking followers to help identify Joey. Within hours, she shared a joyful update: “Thank you everyone! We found him! Surprises ensuing!”The Chiefs followed through in spectacular fashion. In a TikTok video, Joey was seen opening a huge box filled with red, white, and yellow confetti.Inside was a treasure trove of gifts — including a signed Mahomes headband, a No. 15 jersey autographed by the quarterback, and a stack of Chiefs merchandise like caps, foam fingers, and flags. His stunned expression said it all.Nina Miller, now dubbed the “NFL’s Phillies Karen,” initially defended her actions before posting an apology. “At the game, with all the noise and excitement, I honestly thought Mahomes was giving me the headband,” she said. “When I found out it was for that little boy, I felt horrible… I’m sorry that I ruined your moment.”Despite her apology, reports confirmed the stolen headband hadn’t been returned — but Joey’s spirit was restored. His mother, Mindy, summed it up best: “It was such a great day… just to have one person swoop in and take that from him is heartbreaking for a mother to watch.”Thanks to the Chiefs’ compassion, Joey’s story now stands as a reminder that sportsmanship isn’t just about winning games — it’s about doing what’s right when it matters most.Also Read: Why are the Buffalo Bills wearing their bold all-white ‘Cold Front’ uniforms against the Patriots tonight?","Joey Masters, 10, was celebrating his birthday at MetLife Stadium.

He won’t be available for the game, which is a significant blow for the 49ers’ offense. Backup Mac Jones is expected to start under center, making this his first start with the team in a live game situation.Purdy’s absence shifts the responsibility to Mac Jones, who will have to manage the offense and maintain the rhythm established by the 49ers’ starting lineup.

Mac Jones will now have to manage the game, and the receiving corps will have to adjust with Jennings and Pearsall out. Rookie receivers or secondary targets may see more snaps, and the team will likely rely more heavily on the running game to balance the offense.49ers fans will be watching closely to see how Jones performs and whether the team can maintain momentum without their starting QB.

Kyler Murray openly questions consecutive run calls that sealed Arizona’s fate in a game full of high-stakes drama



Late-quarter offensive strategy under intense scrutiny as analysts and fans demand answers from the coaching staff

Momentum lost and pressure mounting on Drew Petzing as Cardinals search for tactical alignment with their star quarterback

Arizona’s path forward hinges on learning from narrow defeats and aligning strategy with Murray’s strengths to reclaim playoff contention

The Arizona Cardinals’ matchup against the Tennessee Titans ended in a nail-biting 22-21 loss, leaving fans and players reeling. What should have been a winnable contest slipped away in the fourth quarter, highlighting cracks in decision-making and sparking visible frustration from Kyler Murray . The defeat not only dented Arizona’s momentum but also intensified scrutiny over offensive strategies as the season reaches a critical stretch.The pivotal moment came late in the fourth quarter when the Cardinals ran the ball three straight times instead of leveraging passing opportunities. Murray didn’t hold back in expressing his bewilderment afterward. “Trust the play call. Really don’t know what to think about that,” he said, his tone revealing genuine exasperation. “I really don’t even know. That’s how to lose a game 101. I don’t know. That was crazy. ” His candid words offered a rare glimpse of a quarterback visibly frustrated with his team’s strategic choices.Murray’s pointed comments have fueled debates among analysts and fans about the Cardinals’ offensive philosophy. Arizona entered the game with high hopes, aiming to assert dominance over a Titans squad struggling for consistency. Instead, the late-quarter approach left lingering questions about play-calling hierarchy, risk assessment, and whether the coaching staff is fully exploiting Murray’s dynamic playmaking abilities in crunch time.With just five games into the season, every loss carries weight, and Murray’s candid critique underscores mounting pressure on offensive coordinator Drew Petzing. Analysts suggest that repeated missteps in play selection could hinder Arizona’s climb in the NFC West standings. For a team built around a versatile quarterback like Murray, failing to capitalize on passing lanes in critical moments illustrates a disconnect between talent and execution.As the Cardinals regroup for upcoming matchups, the focus will remain on improving late-quarter efficiency and better aligning strategy with Murray’s abilities. Fans and insiders alike are watching closely, knowing that adjustments in the next few games could determine whether Arizona stays in playoff contention or falls behind. Murray’s rare public airing of grievances may act as a wake-up call, signaling that patience is running thin and urgency is rising in the desert.Also read: Will Justin Fields play against the Dallas Cowboys today?

Arvinder Singh in action (Special Arrangement)

Thoda afsos hai

Poll Do you believe it's worth moving abroad for better opportunities in sports? Absolutely Maybe Not sure No

Being away from home never gets easier. Every day, you stand in front of the mirror, wondering what your family is doing. The pain doesn’t fade, it quietly settles in. Your mother’s warmth becomes a few seconds of buffering on a video call, and your father? He watches silently from the sidelines.No one leaves home because it’s easy. They leave because it’s necessary. For better opportunities, better facilities, and a better chance at chasing a dream that refuses to let go. As Tony Stark says in ""Iron Man"", ""Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk.""For Indian basketball player Arvinder Singh , it doesn't stop at running; it’s about dribbling, defending, diving for every rebound, and keeping his balance not just on the court, but in life. And right now, he’s doing that not in India, but in Japan, thousands of kilometres away from his home in Barnala, Punjab.(I feel alone sometimes),” he tells TimesofIndia.com from Yamaguchi, his home away from home. “But I train every day, listen to music, go to the gym. That keeps me occupied.”It’s been only a few weeks since he landed in Japan. Playing for Yamaguchi Patsfive in the Japanese B3 League, the Punjabi boy is leading a life that is simple, but lonely.“I cook for myself. Since I’m a vegetarian, it’s difficult to find veg food here. So I watch YouTube, try to make roti and sabzi myself. Sometimes my mom guides me on call,” he says, with a small laugh, somewhat suggesting that scoring a three-pointer is much easier than making a perfectly round roti.But this is what chasing dreams looks like when your home country doesn’t offer you one. India, despite producing players of immense potential, still doesn’t have a stable basketball league.“It’s tough. Leagues start in India but don’t continue regularly,” Arvinder says. “If we had regular matches and exposure trips, we would all be better players. That’s how we improve. Since that’s not happening in India right now, I accepted this offer from Japan to play here and develop my game further.”His comments, though, are not an epitome of frustration but merely a representation of muted disappointment, the kind that comes from knowing what could have been.Arvinder, now 23, has always been one of India’s most promising players.A product of Ludhiana Basketball Academy (LBA) in Ludhiana, which has been a cradle for budding Indian cagers. Growing up, he was a shotputter untill he turned 13 and a LBA coach Rajinder Singh, spotted him and requested his father, an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) in Punjab police to thrust the boy in basketball. And withing a year, Arvinder as drafted in NBA academy in Greater Noida.The 23-year-old was also part of the Indian team that beat Kazakhstan, India's first in 27 years, in the FIBA Asia Cup Qualifiers last year. But the team couldn’t sustain the momentum in the main tournament as they finished winless in the Asia Cup earlier this year.“We lacked experience,” he explains. “All their players play in professional leagues regularly. Playing consistently against tough opponents gives them exposure. Their game vision and court awareness improve naturally.”It’s this understanding that brought him to Japan.But it’s not easy to fit in.“I’ve been here for weeks,” he admits. “Coaches and players mostly speak Japanese. But we have a translator who helps. A few Japanese players also speak English, so they help too. You also learn a lot from body language, and we use signs and gestures on court to communicate plays.”He laughs, but there’s a trace of fatigue under his smile. Loneliness is a quiet companion here.What hurts more, though, is the possibility that he might miss representing India this time in the World Cup qualifiers in November as a result of playing basketball in Japan. His Japanese club is against the idea of releasing him.“There’s a chance I’ll miss it,” he admits softly. “Our league runs for seven months, and the Japanese staff are very strict. Even if I want to go, I’d need to leave a month early for the national camp. The selection happens after the camp. If we skip it, we lose our spot. Going to India isn't possible right now.”Then, after a pause, he adds, “(It hurts a little). Playing for India is always special.”Still, he doesn’t sound defeated: “If you perform well abroad, you’ll always get your chance in the national team. I believe in that. I believe in myself.”For Indian basketball, nevertheless, some hope is left. The Basketball Federation of India, along with ACG Sports, has announced the country’s first-ever professional basketball league, set to begin in 2026.When Arvinder talks about it, his voice suddenly picks up hope: “That’s a big step. It’ll help players a lot. It’ll help the game grow. We’ve waited for this for so long.”And then, when asked what basketball means to him, he smiles. You can hear it in his tone.“Basketball has given me everything. Exposure, a job, a purpose. My parents are happy that through basketball, I’ve found my path and that I’m making the country proud,” adds Arvinder, who represents Railways in nationals.Somewhere between the bouncing of the ball and the silence of an empty apartment in Japan, Arvinder Singh is learning what it really means to ""run before you can walk"".","Arvinder Singh is one of India's most promising basketball players.

Collier further claimed that the incompetence at the top posed a severe threat to the league's viability. She continued:""The real threat to our league isn't money.. It isn't ratings or missed calls or even physical play. It's a lack of accountability from the league office.

Connor McDavid’s contract talks spark growing uncertainty



Oilers insiders remain confident McDavid will stay



The Edmonton Oilers are entering one of their most nerve-wracking seasons in years. Their top priority is securing Connor McDavid ’s future, but recent insider reports have cast serious doubt over whether the superstar will stay in Edmonton beyond this season. With training camp underway and the season opener fast approaching, the uncertainty surrounding McDavid’s next move has the hockey world buzzing.Connor McDavid, now 28, is entering the final season of his eight-year, $100 million contract. Despite months of optimism from within the organization, no extension has been signed, and the silence is beginning to raise eyebrows. On the Barn Burner Podcast, TSN insider Darren Dreger dropped a bombshell, suggesting the odds of McDavid staying with the Oilers are “50-50.”“If it happens, and I’m still 50-50 that it is going to happen,” Dreger said. “But if it gets done in season, I still feel like it’s more likely going to be a shorter contract, like a two-year term. And that probably scares the crap out of Oilers fans and maybe Oilers ownership as well.”Dreger emphasized there’s no friction between McDavid and the organization, but admitted tension is building behind the scenes. “There’s no animosity here,” he said.“Is there nervousness building? Sure. I mean, Daryl Katz is probably getting a little antsy.”The hesitation from McDavid’s camp suggests he’s taking his time to evaluate his future. “We think about it, we talk about it,” McDavid said earlier in camp. “Gauge where we’re at, what we’re feeling. Nothing’s really changed as of now, and just excited to be here.”While Dreger’s comments have fueled speculation, not everyone shares his skepticism. Oilers insider Bob Stauffer remains firm in his belief that McDavid will re-sign with Edmonton — possibly on a shorter deal. “I am remaining at my 102% that McDavid signs some form of an extension with the Oilers,” Stauffer said. “I work for the Oilers Entertainment Group, okay? I’m steadfast at 102%.”Still, with the season opener on October 8 fast approaching and no deal finalized, the anxiety in Edmonton continues to grow. If McDavid does test free agency next summer, it would mark one of the most shocking moves in modern NHL history. For now, all eyes remain on the Oilers’ captain — and whether his heart still belongs in Edmonton.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Sidney Crosby reportedly on one team’s radar as they plan to do whatever it takes to acquire him","Connor McDavid is entering the final season of his eight-year, $100 million contract.

The freak accident that changed Sidney Crosby ’s season

Sidney Crosby gets a puck in the face vs Islanders - NHL 30/3/13

Recovery, resilience, and return to dominance

When Sidney Crosby stepped back onto the ice during the 2013 NHL playoffs without his protective face shield, fans saw more than just the return of a star, they witnessed a testament to resilience. The Pittsburgh Penguins captain had endured one of hockey’s most gruesome injuries just months earlier: a shattered jaw that left him bloodied, toothless, and facing weeks of painful recovery.On March 30, 2013, during a game against the New York Islanders, a slap shot from teammate Brooks Orpik deflected off another player and struck Crosby directly in the face. The puck’s force was devastating, roughly ten of his teeth were damaged, two so badly that they punctured the inside of his mouth near his tongue. The impact broke his jaw, forcing surgeons to insert titanium plates with screws to stabilize the bone.“I can honestly say that was the most traumatic injury that I’ve gone through,” Ottawa Senators defenseman Marc Methot later said, describing a similar experience. Crosby, meanwhile, had to adapt to a liquid diet and lost nearly ten pounds during his recovery. “It’s pretty much impossible to keep weight on,” he admitted, despite being known for his disciplined nutrition.Crosby’s road back wasn’t just about healing bones, it was about reclaiming confidence. Team doctors were cautious, insisting he wear a full facial shield for several weeks before finally clearing him for unprotected play during the Eastern Conference Final. “They’re comfortable with it coming off,” Crosby said of his doctors. “It’s nice to see a little bit better.”His comeback was nothing short of spectacular. Despite the physical trauma, Crosby returned to lead the Penguins with 15 points in 10 playoff games. His agent, Pat Brisson, credited the captain’s perseverance, saying, “Through adversity like that, you become stronger and stronger.”Also Read: Inside Sidney Crosby and Kathy Leutner’s private love story that has lasted more than 15 years For Crosby, who had already battled concussions that once jeopardized his career, this injury became another chapter in his story of grit.

Drama erupted at the exhibition chess event Checkmate: USA vs India on Saturday, as American Grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura drew sharp criticism for throwing away the 19-year-old world champion D Gukesh’s king after the World No. 2's win over the Indian Grandmaster.The incident came as the USA team whitewashed India 5-0 in the opening fixture at the Esports Stadium Arlington.The move immediately sparked debate in the chess community, with FIDE CEO Emil Sutovsky weighing in on social media. On X, Sutovsky wrote: “The event was a show. Fans were ecstatic. Players were encouraged to behave accordingly. All true. Now, for better or worse, name me one top player who would do what Hikaru did.”The official Checkmate: USA vs India account replied with tongue-in-cheek humour: “On behalf of the organizers, we admit having forced the players to have fun, to please the crowd and to forego the FIDE Etiquette. We sincerely apologize if the players, the live audience and the vast majority of online viewers had a good time.”Quoting this, Nakamura responded with three laughing emojis, further fueling online debate.Former world champion Vladimir Kramnik was scathing in his criticism of the American Grandmaster. On X, Kramnik called the act “a diagnosis of the degradation of modern chess”: “I don’t know who came up with this childish, tasteless act. Likely this ‘thinker’ had no specific intention to humiliate Gukesh, but could have realized that this public gesture (using opponent’s KING) looks offensive and provocative ESPECIALLY against the World Champion. ”Kramnik added: “There are players who show respect and mature gentlemanly behaviour, many prominent players in fact (Wesley So, Gukesh himself, and many others). Promoting for years the player known for his awful behaviour instead — deliberate action, damaging our game in my opinion.”Despite the tense moments and multiple near-wins from both sides, the USA dominated the match, leaving India without a single point in the first Checkmate encounter.",Hikaru Nakamura drew sharp criticism for throwing away the 19-year-old world champion D Gukesh’s king after the World No. 2's win over the Indian Grandmaster.
