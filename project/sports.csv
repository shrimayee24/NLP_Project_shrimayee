Carlos Alcaraz completed his post-match TV interviews after defeating Novak Djokovic 6-4, 7-6 (4), 6-2 in the U.S. Open semifinals on Friday.Before beginning the interviews, Alcaraz paused to check his phone for updates on Jannik Sinner's semifinal match against Felix Auger-Aliassime, which was still in its first set.Sinner later secured his place in the final with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Auger-Aliassime. This set up a historic US Open final between No. 1 Sinner and No. 2 Alcaraz, marking the first time two players will face each other in three consecutive Grand Slam finals in one season.""These two players are the best in the world right now,"" said Djokovic, a 24-time major champion.The duo has dominated men's tennis, splitting the past eight major trophies and claiming 10 of the past 13. Alcaraz currently holds five Slam titles, while Sinner has four.The upcoming final will also determine the No. 1 ranking, with President Donald Trump expected to attend.The rivalry between Alcaraz and Sinner has intensified throughout the year, with Alcaraz winning at the French Open in June and Sinner prevailing at Wimbledon in July.Sinner aims to become the first repeat men's champion in New York since Roger Federer's five consecutive victories from 2004 to 2008. He has reached five straight Grand Slam finals since his US Open appearance last year.Alcaraz has maintained a perfect record without dropping a set as he pursues his sixth major title and second at Flushing Meadows.Since April, Alcaraz has dominated with a 44-2 record, reaching finals in his last eight tour-level events.""It's something that I'm working on, just the consistency on the matches, on the tournaments, on the year, in general. Just not having up-and-downs in (a) match. Probably, I'm just getting mature, just getting to know myself much better, what I need on, off the court,"" the Spaniard said.Sinner's record against Alcaraz in 2024 stands at 1-6, while maintaining an impressive 109-4 record against all other opponents.""We have played quite a lot this year. So we know each other very well,"" Sinner said.Alcaraz had previously lost to Djokovic in their last two encounters - the Paris Olympics gold-medal final and the Australian Open quarterfinals. ""It's not easy playing against him, to be honest. I'm thinking about the legend; what he has achieved in his career. It's difficult not to think about it,"" Alcaraz added.Djokovic, at 38, showed signs of fatigue by the match's end. He reached semifinals in all four Slams this season but was eliminated each time, with three losses to either Alcaraz or Sinner.""It's frustrating on the court when you are not able to keep up with that level physically, but at the same time, it's something also expected, I guess. It comes with time and with age,"" the veteran admitted.""I still want to play ... (a) full Grand Slam season next year. Let's see whether that's going to happen or not, but ... Slams are Slams. They are just different from any other tournament. They are the pillars of our sport, the most important tournaments we have. But I do fancy my chances a bit more in best-of-three.""Despite leading 3-0 in the second set, Djokovic couldn't maintain his advantage against Alcaraz.""Today, I'd say, it wasn't the best level of the tournament for me, but I just kept a cool level (from) the beginning until the last point,"" he explained.Alcaraz appeared in a pink sleeveless shirt, sporting regrown hair after a recent buzz cut necessitated by his brother's failed attempt at being a barber.When asked about maintaining his new look if victorious on Sunday, Alcaraz responded: ""Even better. You will see. ... Surprise, surprise.""","Carlos Alcaraz defeated Novak Djokovic 6-4, 7-6 (4), 6-2 in the U.S. Open semifinals.

Aryna Sabalenka has been open about navigating personal tragedy while continuing to dominate the tennis world. Following the sudden passing of her ex-boyfriend, Konstantin Koltsov, in March 2024, the Belarusian star found support in a new relationship with Brazilian entrepreneur Georgios Frangulis. The two went public in spring 2024, and since then, he has become a familiar face courtside, cheering her on at major tournaments.Aryna Sabalenka admitted that her new relationship came during an incredibly difficult chapter in her life. She credited Georgios Frangulis with helping her focus on joy beyond the pressures of tennis.“There was a really tough period where I was really happy to have him by my side, always cheering me up, always making sure that we are doing some fun stuff,” Sabalenka told People. “But I make sure I kind of forget about tennis and focus on the good things and enjoy my life. Even when things are going wrong in my career. So yeah, he was my biggest support and yeah, really happy to have him by my side.”Their relationship became public when they were first pictured together in April 2024. Since then, Frangulis has been spotted regularly in her player’s box, including at her title run at the 2024 US Open.Born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil, to a Greek family originally from Thessaloniki, Frangulis pursued law at Fundação Armando Alvares Penteado but never became a lawyer. His passion was always in entrepreneurship. After graduating in 2014, he moved to the United States, first living in Miami and later in California.A spiritual person, Frangulis has spoken about how faith shaped his outlook. “I go to church a lot, talking to God does me good. I was influenced by both branches of the family. The spiritual side has always been important to me – as well as intuition,” he told Forbes Brazil.In 2016, Frangulis founded Oakberry, an açaí-based brand that has since expanded worldwide. Known for its bowls and smoothies, Oakberry now has hundreds of locations across more than 40 countries. By January 2024, Sabalenka herself became an ambassador for the brand, later launching her own signature bowl.“Most of the time I go for Oakberry bowl; I think it's healthy and a good thing to start your day,” Sabalenka said in an interview. “It has everything you [want]: protein, carbs, vitamins, fruit. It's like an energy bowl, so I feel ready to go after I have it.”Beyond business, Frangulis balances his entrepreneurial career with his passion for motorsports. He has raced in Porsche GT3 Cup Challenge events and the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup, finding in racing both adrenaline and escape.Georgios Frangulis has a visible presence in Aryna Sabalenka’s careerWhile Oakberry has sponsored tennis tournaments before, Frangulis admitted the experience of sitting in Sabalenka’s box is far more intense. “The toughest part is being in the box. It’s one of the most stressful situations I’ve ever experienced,” he said.“I never say anything during matches. I try not to show too much emotion, because Aryna notices everything – what everyone is doing in the box. I just clap as loudly as I can and make sure she feels supported.”Also Read: Who is Naomi Osaka’s husband?

NEW DELHI: At a Grand Slam where fashion goes hand-in-hand with tennis, it was Aryna Sabalenka who had the last laugh at Flushing Meadows. More than that, she created a lasting impression on and off the court while it rained outside the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, New York.On the court, she beat Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 7-6 (3) to successfully defend her US Open title. In the process, she pocketed her fourth Grand Slam title and 100th victory at majors.And at the trophy ceremony, the fashion supremacy kicked in as the Belarusian wore a metallic silver jacket, matching perfectly with the silver of the trophy she had received from 18-time major champion Chris Evert Sabalenka has four now, in comparison, including two at the US Open, winning back-to-back titles. No one had won two in a row at Flushing Meadows since Serena Williams in 2013-14. Before the tournament began, she was asked about this long run.""Wow, that's insane, you know, how unpredictable women's tennis is, right? Should we change it? Should we try at least to change it?"" said the 27-year-old, before adding, ""My thought is to change that.""And she changed that successfully on Saturday evening with the roof closed over Arthur Ashe Stadium.Despite what the scoreline suggests, it wasn't all smooth sailing as she would have liked. Sabalenka, who likes to express her feelings on court, and lets her box know in the process, started slowly as Anisimova forced her into the corner.And that is one position Sabalenka doesn't enjoy. She was shoved into that place during the French Open final loss to Coco Gauff, acknowledging how stressed she got against the American in Paris.This time, too, she was broken at 3-2 in the opening set and smacked the ball away in frustration.Instead, she won the next four games, as Anisimova's risk-reward game of winners to unforced errors tipped towards 13-15. Sabalenka converted all three of her break point chances, served better, returned better, kept the error rate down. In fact, she made three unforced errors in the first five games and made none in the next four.Then in the second set, the World No. 1 twice led by a break, served for the title at 5-4 and came within two points of closing it out. An overhead had her backpedalling, and the smash went flush into the middle of the net. Anisimova converted the break point, and the 24,000 fans were up on their feet.Was this going to be the breaking point for Sabalenka? And the turning point for New Jersey-born Anisimova? Not quite.About 15 minutes later, Sabalenka was on her knees, both her hands covering her face in jubilation, having just converted her third match point opportunity in the tiebreak.That her first major of the year, after two painful final losses to Americans, came in a tiebreak felt fitting. It extended her record to 21-1 in breakers this season, including 19 in a row, and underscored that the defeat to Gauff in Paris was a rare blip.“All those tough lessons (were) worth this one,” Sabalenka said. “I’m speechless right now.”“It’s been tough this year. In those finals, I was really terrible. But come on, it’s worth it, right? Thank you so much. I love you; you’re my family. Thank you to my boyfriend — without your support, I wouldn’t be able to make it,” she continued.As the silver jacket shimmered under the artificial Arthur Ashe lights, Sabalenka’s victory felt bigger than the previous three. It was the culmination of a season in which she turned lessons from painful defeats into fuel, and a reminder that women’s tennis, often accused of unpredictability, now has a figure who is setting the tone at the very top.Her brash energy on court, the roars, the clenched fist directed at her team are contrasts to the poise and flair she projects once the battle is over. Few athletes today blur the lines between raw emotion and refined spectacle quite like Sabalenka; and in New York, the stage rewards both.","Aryna Sabalenka beat Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 7-6 (3) to successfully defend her US Open title.

Amanda Anisimova experienced disappointment in her second Grand Slam final, losing to Aryna Sabalenka at the US Open on Saturday.The 24-year-old American, who was also runner-up at Wimbledon in July, lost 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) to the world number one and defending champion Sabalenka.Despite displaying powerful gameplay against Sabalenka, Anisimova struggled to maintain consistency against her Belarusian opponent.""Losing in two finals is great but it is also super hard. I didn't fight hard enough for my dreams today,"" said Anisimova.""I didn't win today, so of course I didn't do enough. That's just the reality, and I have to accept that. I feel like if I fought harder, then maybe I would have given myself more of a chance, but I feel like I was really kind of in the back seat today. I just felt like throughout the match I wasn't playing my best tennis.""Following her previous 6-0, 6-0 loss to Iga Swiatek at Wimbledon, Anisimova continues to work on managing her nerves during major tournaments.""I feel like with finals I have a lot of nerves, and it's something I'm trying to work on, but I just wish I played more aggressive,"" stated Anisimova. ""Of course, she (Sabalenka) was playing amazing. She was playing very aggressive and doing all the right things, so she made it very difficult for me today.""In the first set, Anisimova recovered from an early deficit to secure a 3-2 lead with two service breaks.The closed roof at Arthur Ashe Stadium, due to heavy rain, affected Anisimova's visibility, leading to Sabalenka winning the next four games and the set.""I haven't played on the court during the day with the roof closed, and it was literally, like, white, and I couldn't see the ball when I was serving,"" added Anisimova. ""That was a huge shock to my system. It was extremely frustrating for me.""The second set saw Anisimova constantly trailing, and despite breaking Sabalenka's serve while the top seed was serving for the match, she ultimately lost in the tiebreak.""Making it to the final is obviously really special, but it would have been a dream come true to make it all the way,"" said Anisimova. ""I hope I can keep working really hard to give myself more opportunities to be in more and more finals.""","Amanda Anisimova lost 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) to Aryna Sabalenka in the US Open final.

Deion Sanders’ advice for Travis Hunter as a new dad



Travis Hunter embraces fatherhood and NFL dreams



Travis Hunter is stepping into fatherhood and the NFL at the same time, and one man who has been by his side throughout this journey is Deion Sanders. The Hall of Famer, who once recruited Hunter to Jackson State and later coached him at Colorado, recently shared heartfelt fatherly advice for the Jacksonville Jaguars rookie as he embraces life’s two biggest milestones — becoming a professional athlete and a dad.For Deion Sanders, Travis Hunter has always been more than a player. Their bond goes back to 2021 when Hunter, then the No. 1 recruit in the nation, shocked everyone by committing to Jackson State instead of a powerhouse like Florida State. He later followed Sanders to Colorado, where he won the 2024 Heisman Trophy as a two-way sensation. Through it all, Sanders played a fatherly role, especially during Hunter’s toughest moments.On the night Hunter lifted the Heisman, his biological father was absent due to legal troubles. Sanders stepped in, embracing the young star in what became one of the most emotional moments of Hunter’s career. Years later, when Sanders was quietly battling a bladder cancer scare and couldn’t attend Hunter’s wedding, the rookie showed up at his coach’s Texas ranch, standing by him as the two shared quiet moments fishing together.“Oh my god, I’m taking a deep breath because I love him to life — I love him like he’s my son,” Sanders said. “It’s funny when your son is now a father… it’s a beautiful thing.“The thing that I told him is let’s correct all the things that we think we didn’t receive as children and let’s do that in our fatherhood. No matter what happens, let’s make sure we are the best darn father that ever walked. That’s what I told him. I’m proud of him, I love him to life, and I miss him dearly.”It wasn’t coach-speak. It was a father figure speaking to someone he considers family. And Hunter will also be happy to get some off-field advice from Coach Prime.Travis Hunter, just 22, is now a husband and a father. He and his longtime girlfriend, Leanna Lenee, tied the knot earlier this year before welcoming their first child, a baby boy. In a heartfelt video titled “Dear Son…”, Hunter can be heard saying to his newborn, “Gotta be better than me.”The timing couldn’t be more symbolic. On September 7, Hunter will make his NFL debut when the Jaguars face the Carolina Panthers. It marks the start of two parallel journeys: one on the field as a top draft pick, and one at home as a father. With Sanders’ wisdom and his own determination, Hunter now carries two legacies — as a rising NFL star and as a dad committed to doing things right. Fans and critics will be watching Travis Hunter how he make his debut a dreamy one. he is ready to show what he is capable of and to prove that he is indeed a two-way player and rare.Also Read: Justin Jefferson injury update: Vikings may take cautious approach as hamstring issue raises long-term concerns","Jacksonville Jaguars rookie Travis Hunter will make his NFL debut on September 7.

Medical expert breaks down what a shoulder dislocation could mean for Xavier Worthy



“Best-case scenario, Worthy could be back in about three weeks,”





Fans react with panic, humor, and everything in between



Kansas City Chiefs fans are on edge after reports surfaced about Xavier Worthy potentially suffering a shoulder dislocation. With the season still in its early stages, losing a key wideout could be a major blow. And with many experts weighing in on the situation, the stakes feel even higher. Fans are now debating whether Worthy will be back in a few weeks or if this injury could derail his season entirely.A sports medicine specialist gave a stark assessment of the situation.he said, but he added a cautionary note: there’s a very high around 50% chance of re-injury even after recovery. The worst-case scenario, according to him, would be surgery, which could end Worthy’s season before it even properly starts. This kind of prognosis immediately sent shockwaves through Chiefs fans, who rely on Worthy’s explosiveness and playmaking ability.Xavier Worthy has been a key piece of the Chiefs’ offensive arsenal, and his potential absence forces head coach Andy Reid and quarterback Patrick Mahomes to rethink their approach.Without Worthy stretching the field, defenses could focus more on other receivers, putting extra pressure on Mahomes. Rookie and secondary receivers might need to step up, and any chemistry Mahomes has been building with Worthy would take time to rebuild. Chiefs fans are already debating who could take on a larger role in his absence, with names like Skyy Moore and Mecole Hardman frequently coming up.The news didn’t take long to trend on social media.Some fans reacted with genuine concern.Others tried to keep the mood light, joking.A few optimistic voices argued that three weeks is manageable and that Worthy would return stronger.Overall, the mix of worry and humor shows just how much fans care about their star wideout.Chiefs Nation is now in a holding pattern, hoping for the best but preparing for the worst. Whether Worthy bounces back quickly or faces a longer recovery, his health will be crucial for Kansas City’s early-season success. Fans will be watching every update closely, ready to react the moment news drops.Also read - Ryan Clark could be on thin ice at ESPN after heated on-air feud with Peter Schrager",Xavier Worthy could miss the rest of the season with a dislocated shoulder.

The 24-year-old safety, who played college football for the Colorado Buffaloes, signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an undrafted free agent right after the 2025 NFL Draft in April. But his chance ended quickly. On August 23, 2025, during a preseason game against the Buffalo Bills in Tampa, Florida, Shilo Sanders was ejected for throwing a punch. A day later, on August 24, 2025, the Buccaneers released him from the roster.The NFL fined Shilo Sanders $4,669 for the punch that got him ejected against the Buffalo Bills. The play happened during the second quarter of the game at Raymond James Stadium, when Sanders got into a scuffle with Bills wide receiver Andy Isabella.Tampa Bay head coach Todd Bowles, who had earlier praised Sanders’ effort in camp, did not comment in detail after the game but confirmed the team wouldOnce Sanders was waived on August 24, no other team put in a claim, and he cleared waivers. The Buccaneers also chose not to place him on their practice squad, leaving him a free agent.This means as of Friday, September 5, 2025, Shilo Sanders has not signed with any NFL team.His future in the league remains uncertain.Shilo Sanders still has options outside the NFL. The Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League currently hold his exclusive negotiating rights. That means if Sanders wants to play in the CFL, Toronto is the only team allowed to sign him.His father, Deion Sanders, the Colorado Buffaloes head coach, said in late August that he isand believes his son still has the talent to play at the professional level.Shilo’s agents, Drew Rosenhaus and Robert Bailey, are continuing to push for an NFL chance, even if it starts on a practice squad. If no NFL team offers him a contract this season, Shilo could look at the United Football League (UFL) in spring 2026.That league has been giving young players another platform to prove they belong in pro football. For now, Sanders remains on the market, waiting for his next shot.Shilo Sanders’ journey shows resilience, determination, patience, growth, focus, perseverance, adaptability, courage, hope, ambition, skill, preparation, learning, opportunity, mentorship, vision, discipline, confidence, persistence, motivation, drive, commitment, determination, focus, improvement, strategy, teamwork, resilience, belief, and future potential.","Shilo Sanders is still without a team in the NFL.

Ronaldo’s late-window power play for Greenwood

Who is Mason Greenwood, and why now?

23 goals in 39 appearances across competitions



22 goals and 6 assists in 36 matches in Ligue 1



Golden Boot winner in Ligue 1 (21 league goals), joint with PSG’s Ousmane Dembélé



Instrumental in securing Marseille’s return to the Champions League





Why Greenwood fits Ronaldo’s vision at Al-Nassr

The bigger picture: Saudi ambitions and a transfer race still alive

Neom SC is eyeing Chelsea’s Axel Disasi



Raheem Sterling is also being considered for a Saudi switch



Al-Qadsiah may revive interest in Andrey Santos



Al-Ittihad are targeting FC Porto midfielder Rodrigo Mora



Al-Ahli have shown interest in Bayer Leverkusen’s Exequiel Palacios





With just days left before the Saudi Pro League transfer window shuts on September 23, Cristiano Ronaldo is personally driving Al-Nassr’s efforts to land Marseille’s in-form forward Mason Greenwood. The move, if it materialises, could define Al-Nassr’s silverware ambitions this season, and possibly reshape Greenwood’s career trajectory yet again.Cristiano Ronaldo, now 40, may be in the twilight of his career, but he's showing no signs of slowing down — either on the pitch or in the boardroom. After extending his contract with Al-Nassr for another two years, committing to the club past his 42nd birthday, Ronaldo has turned his focus to one objective: winning trophies in Saudi Arabia, something that has eluded him since his arrival.His influence already proved decisive in bringing Portuguese teammate João Félix to Al-Nassr this summer in a deal worth up to £43.7 million. Now, he wants another familiar name by his side, Mason Greenwood, the 23-year-old former Manchester United prodigy, now thriving at Olympique de Marseille.According toand other reports, Ronaldo is actively pushing for Al-Nassr to sign Greenwood before the Saudi transfer window slams shut on September 23.European windows are closed, but Saudi clubs remain in the hunt, and Greenwood’s name has shot to the top of Al-Nassr’s wish list.This would mark a dramatic shift for Greenwood, who reportedly turned down Saudi approaches in 2024. But with Ronaldo now fronting the effort, the tide may be turning.Mason Greenwood’s talent has never been in doubt, only his trajectory. A product of Manchester United’s academy, Greenwood joined the club at the age of six and rose rapidly through the ranks, making his senior debut on 6 March 2019 at 17 years and 156 days, becoming United’s youngest-ever Champions League player in a historic win over Paris Saint-Germain.he burst onto the scene with both feet (literally, known for being ambipedal), scoring 35 goals across all competitions for United before his controversial exit.But in January 2022, Greenwood was arrested following allegations connected to material that had been published online. The charges — which included attempted rape and assault — were formally dropped on 2 February 2023. Despite the legal case not proceeding, Greenwood remained suspended by Manchester United throughout the process. After conducting an internal review, the club ultimately decided he would not return to the first-team setup.Following a loan to Getafe, Greenwood returned to Manchester in the summer of 2024, where he was informed by the coaching staff that he would be sold. That led to a fresh start at Olympique de Marseille, who signed him in July 2024. It was here that Greenwood began to rebuild, not just form, but reputation. His first season was emphatic:Now 23, Greenwood has once again emerged as one of the most sought-after young forwards, not just in Europe but also across the growing football frontier of the Middle East. His Marseille form even sparked brief speculation about a return to the England national team, despite his decision this summer to decline a call-up from Jamaica.That invitation came as part of Jamaica’s World Cup qualifying campaign, led by head coach and former Manchester United assistant Steve McClaren, who briefly overlapped with Greenwood at Old Trafford. Although Greenwood had obtained a Jamaican passport and was expected to join the squad, he ultimately opted out after discussions with his family, choosing instead to prioritise his club career and defer any international commitment for now.Ronaldo’s push for Greenwood isn’t about nostalgia, it’s based on first-hand experience. The pair were previously teammates at Manchester United during the 2021/22 campaign, featuring together in 17 matches across the Premier League and Champions League. Ronaldo saw Greenwood’s potential up close in that stretch: a technically gifted, ambidextrous forward with a natural instinct for goal.That impression has clearly stuck. Greenwood, now 23, represents the kind of profile Al-Nassr have struggled to attract, a clinical finisher with top-tier European pedigree, still in his prime, and hungry to re-establish himself at the top level. Crucially, he also comes with the ability to slot into a fluid frontline. Paired with João Félix, Greenwood could inject a sharper, more unpredictable dynamic into Al-Nassr’s attack, precisely what Ronaldo envisions as the club pushes to end its silverware drought.Frustrations have been mounting at Al-Nassr. Recent shortcomings in both the Saudi Pro League and AFC Champions League have left Ronaldo discontent. And despite winning the Golden Boot in back-to-back years, the Portugal international is yet to win the Saudi Pro League, as Al Nassr finished third in 2024/25 – 13 points behind winners Al Ittihad.

Fans Roast Travis Kelce After Brutal Collision With Xavier Worthy

Xavier Worthy’s current status after leaving the opener



The Chiefs’ season opener against the Chargers was supposed to be all about Patrick Mahomes’ passing fireworks and Kansas City’s attempt to launch another Super Bowl run. Instead, the storyline took a bizarre turn when Travis Kelce , the face of the franchise, accidentally knocked out his own rookie receiver, Xavier Worthy, just minutes into the game. Worthy’s shoulder injury forced him out early, but the internet made sure the hit kept trending long after kickoff.On the Chiefs’ third offensive play of the night, Kelce and Worthy ran crossing routes but ended up colliding with each other instead of confusing the defense. Kelce’s 250-pound frame slammed directly into the 170-pound rookie, sending Worthy crumpling to the turf in obvious pain.He walked off holding his shoulder, was taken to the locker room shortly after, and officially ruled out in the second quarter. What made the moment sting even more for Chiefs Kingdom is the timing, Kansas City is already thin at wide receiver, with Rashee Rice suspended and fellow rookie Jalen Royals sidelined. Losing Worthy early looked like the nightmare start nobody saw coming.If Chiefs fans were panicked, NFL Twitter was on fire with a mix of jokes, anger, and conspiracy takes. Some fans framed the whole thing as Kelce’s “revenge season,” with one viral post reading:Others mocked the play like it deserved a flag:A few even speculated the shoulder might be dislocated, while one bettor couldn’t help but laugh:Of course, the Swiftie crossover was inevitable. One fan joked Worthy just lost his invite to the, while another imagined him trolling pre-game with,Whether it was painful or playful, the internet made sure the hit went viral.As of now, the Chiefs haven’t confirmed the severity of Worthy’s shoulder injury. He’s expected to undergo more testing, including an MRI, once the team returns from Brazil. Initial reports suggest it could be serious, but fans and coaches alike are holding their breath especially since Worthy was drafted for his blazing speed and big-play potential.Without him, the Chiefs’ receiving depth looks even thinner, putting more pressure on Mahomes and Kelce to carry the load in the passing game.Also read - “Ugly ass”: Antonio Brown’s trolling hits a new level as he mocks A.J.

Pittsburgh Steelers star T.J. Watt reveals retirement plan sparked by childhood jealousy of his brothers playing a sport he never got to play,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/pittsburgh-steelers-star-t-j-watt-reveals-retirement-plan-sparked-by-childhood-jealousy-of-his-brothers-playing-a-sport-he-never-got-to-play/articleshow/123738328.cms,"Photo by Cooper Neill/Getty Images

‘I loved hockey’: T.J. Watt admits childhood jealousy of his brothers shaped the retirement plan he still dreams about



T.J. Watt: Full Interview

Why the Pittsburgh Steelers paid $123 million: T.J. Watt continues to define the team’s defensive legacy



In July 2025, the Pittsburgh Steelers doubled down on their defensive cornerstone, signing T.J. Watt to a three-year, $123 million extension that made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL. It’s a staggering commitment to a player who has already delivered seven Pro Bowls, four All-Pro nods, and the 2021 Defensive Player of the Year award. Yet, even as Watt continues to terrify quarterbacks in Pittsburgh, life looks different now. At 30, a new father with wife Dani Rhodes, he admits that the thought of retirement has started to creep in, and with it, the return of a childhood dream.Growing up in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, all three Watt brothers laced up skates before ever wearing helmets and pads. T.J. began skating at just two years old, playing center until about age eleven. “I loved hockey. I really did,” T.J. Watt told Graham Bensinger during a 2025 sit-down interview. “I think beer league would be the most fun to do after I’m done playing.”The passion was real. “I finally made AAA and, like I said before, it was such a tough sport to have three boys in, especially at that age, because you’re at different levels and getting pulled in different directions,” Watt explained. While J.J. and Derek Watt pushed further into AAA hockey, J.J. even traveling to Germany with their father and grandfather, T.J. never got that chance. “I felt shorted in that aspect. I felt like I was pretty damn good at hockey, and obviously J.J.and Derek were really good too.”The memory still stings. While his brother packed for Europe, T.J. was forced to hand over a jersey he had just earned. That hunger for competition did not vanish. It simply shifted into football.If hockey left a void, the NFL filled it with dominance. Since being drafted in 2017, Watt has recorded 108 sacks, 33 forced fumbles, and even seven interceptions. He became Pittsburgh’s all-time sack leader by 2024 and, despite playing on a bad ankle last season, still produced 11.5 sacks and six forced fumbles. Steelers insider Mark Kaboly captured the expectations perfectly when he said, “He’s going to have 20 sacks this year.”For most defenders, those numbers would headline a career. For Watt, they are seen as a dip. That is why Pittsburgh’s massive extension is not just a payday. It is a belief that the storm inside him is far from over.Watt has made peace with the idea that one day, he will hang up the black and gold jersey. When that happens, it will not be the end of the competition. It will be the return to the ice he never stopped loving. Until then, Steelers fans at Acrisure Stadium can count on more chaos off the edge, and someday, maybe they will spot their legend skating in a beer-league rink, grinning under a different helmet.Also Read: T.J.

Amen Thompson recalls rooting against Golden State Warriors during LeBron James era

Amen & Ausar Thompson on Locking In and Their New Rockets and Pistons Teammates

From LeBron James’ finals battles to his own playoff clash, Amen Thompson’s feelings for Golden State Warriors runs deep

NBA youngster Amen Thompson is quickly becoming one of the league’s boldest new stars. He is not shy about discussing his competitive flame and what ignited it. The Houston Rockets point guard recently admitted on The Old Man and the Three that he is a massive LeBron James fan. He further said that his initial dislike of the Golden State Warriors was directly driven by his love for the NBA legend.During a recent podcast appearance, Amen Thompson, who is a fan of LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers, acknowledged that he turned against the Golden State Warriors when they began to compete with James. This was probably a reference to the 2015-2018 NBA Finals.Twin brothers Amen and Ausar Thompson , two of the league's most athletic players, are big fans of LeBron. Amen further said during the same podcast:“So we wanted to be tall. My mom’s like 5’6, my dad’s like 5’7… So we wrote 6’9 all over the bed because that’s how tall we wanted to be.”He continued:“I was a LeBron fan, I’m not gonna lie. I didn’t dislike the Warriors until, I actually liked the Warriors until they had to start playing LeBron. And then I’m like, ‘Okay, now I hate the Warriors.’”The competition served as Amen Thompson's exposure to high-stakes basketball while he was in his early teens. The Warriors automatically became the enemy. Years have passed, and Thompson finally opened up about it.Many young NBA players might feel the same way, who grew up watching the Cavaliers-Warriors rivalry of the 2010s. For four consecutive years, the finals were characterized by LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers facing Stephen Curry and the G.S.Warriors.The Warriors walked away with three championships during that stretch, while LeBron’s Cavs secured their only victory in 2016.After what the Warriors did to his Rockets in the 2025 NBA Playoffs, it's doubtful that Thompson likes them any more now than he did when they were playing James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the championship series.In addition to igniting long-standing feelings, the game offered Thompson an opportunity to establish himself against Stephen Curry. His performance reaffirmed the notion that, despite facing one of the most successful teams in league history, Houston has a young cornerstone that doesn't back down from a challenge.Also read: ""Openly taunting LeBron""- Skip Bayless claims Los Angeles Lakers are disrespecting LeBron James by backing Luka Doncic","Amen Thompson is a fan of LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Cam Heyward’s contract resolution sets the tone



Cam Heyward remains vital to Steelers’ defensive identity



The Pittsburgh Steelers have ended weeks of uncertainty by striking a revised deal with veteran defensive lineman Cam Heyward just days before their Week 1 matchup against the New York Jets. The 36-year-old star can now earn up to $18 million this season, with more than $3 million added in incentives, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter. For Pittsburgh, it ensures their defensive anchor is not only available but also fully locked in when the season kicks off.Cam Heyward’s hold-in during training camp hinted at tension, but the team captain never stopped leading from the sidelines. He skipped preseason action while pushing for fair recognition of his value in his 15th season, a rare feat for a defensive lineman still playing at an elite level. His track record speaks for itself: 718 total tackles, 88.5 sacks, and seven Pro Bowl selections across 211 career games.By finalizing the deal, both sides avoided distractions before kickoff. Heyward’s return provides the Steelers with a stabilizing force, not just for his production on the field, but for his voice in the locker room. As he said recently, “I’ve had to have a lot of tough conversations with my family regarding whether to play against the Jets.Now, those conversations will solely be things like, ‘Go Steelers.’” That clarity resets his focus entirely on football.For a franchise synonymous with defense, Heyward continues to be a cornerstone. Last season alone, he logged eight sacks, 20 quarterback hits, 12 tackles for loss, and 11 pass deflections while playing every single game. His presence alongside T.J. Watt ensures Pittsburgh’s pass rush stays among the league’s most feared.Head coach Mike Tomlin is counting on Heyward to set the tone against Aaron Rodgers and the Jets. And for fans, there’s reassurance in knowing the veteran isn’t going anywhere. Heyward has spent his entire career in black and gold, and this agreement reaffirms his legacy as one of the defining players of his era.Focused, motivated, and under contract, Cam Heyward enters 2025 ready to remind the league why he still stands among the NFL’s best.Also Read: Xavier Worthy’s injury leaves Chiefs searching, and one free agent WR stands out as the clear solution","Pittsburgh Steelers and Cam Heyward have agreed to a revised contract.

Xavier Worthy injury highlights Chiefs’ need for veteran depth



Andy Reid on Xavier Worthy INJURY after the Chiefs LOSE to Chargers in Brazil

Chiefs weigh options as Eagles rematch looms



The Kansas City Chiefs opened their season with high expectations, but an early injury has already cast a shadow over their wide receiver depth. Rookie standout Xavier Worthy collided with Travis Kelce in the first quarter against the Los Angeles Chargers, suffering a shoulder injury that forced him out of the game. While the team hasn’t released a timeline for his return, the uncertainty has sparked calls for Kansas City to add a proven veteran.Worthy’s injury comes at a challenging time. Rashee Rice is suspended for six games, Jalen Royals is sidelined with a knee issue, and Hollywood Brown is still regaining form after his own injury. That leaves Patrick Mahomes with limited options beyond JuJu Smith-Schuster and a handful of unproven names.NFL insider Evan Massey believes the solution could be Kendrick Bourne, the former New England Patriots wideout who remains a free agent. Bourne’s numbers don’t leap off the page—292 receptions, 3,714 yards, and 22 touchdowns across 111 career games—but his experience could bring much-needed stability to a depleted group.“Playing alongside a quarterback like Mahomes is a big help for any wide receiver,” Massey explained.“For Bourne, it could be exactly what he needs to have a breakout season and get his career back on track after a couple of disappointing seasons with the Patriots.”The Chiefs’ receiver rotation against the Chargers showed both promise and gaps. Brown posted a strong performance with 10 catches for 99 yards, while Smith-Schuster and Tyquan Thornton chipped in with key plays. But consistency remains a question mark, especially with the looming rematch against the Philadelphia Eagles next week.Kansas City’s front office faces a decision: trust the young receivers to step up or bring in a seasoned veteran like Bourne. With Mahomes at the helm, any addition has the chance to thrive, but the team can’t afford to risk offensive rhythm with multiple starters unavailable.The Eagles clash will test the Chiefs’ resilience and could accelerate their decision-making. If Worthy’s injury proves serious, Kansas City may not wait long before making a move.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders’s NFL future questioned after insider update on limited 2025 playing chances with Browns","Xavier Worthy suffered a shoulder injury against the Los Angeles Chargers.

Shedeur Sanders enters NFL as a long-term project



What’s next for Shedeur Sanders and the Browns?



Shedeur Sanders entered the NFL with plenty of attention, but fans eager to see him take the field for the Cleveland Browns this season may have to wait. While the franchise has confidence in his future, their short-term plans tell a different story. With veteran Joe Flacco locked in as the starter and rookie Dillon Gabriel positioned as his backup, Sanders begins his rookie campaign firmly as the team’s third option.The Browns made an intriguing choice in April’s draft, selecting Gabriel in the third round before taking Sanders with the No. 144 pick. According to The Athletic’s Dianna Russini, the decision wasn’t part of some hidden agenda. “The pick wasn’t some master plan from ownership. It was GM Andrew Berry’s call, rooted in his belief that Cleveland’s coaching staff could bring out the best in Sanders and help him grow into an NFL quarterback,” she wrote.Cleveland’s patient approach was evident throughout preseason. Sanders impressed in his debut against the Panthers, throwing for 138 yards and two touchdowns in a decisive 38-10 win. But consistency proved elusive. An oblique injury sidelined him for the next game, and his finale against the Rams was a stark contrast — 14 yards on six attempts, five sacks, and little rhythm.Despite the uneven results, Sanders survived roster cuts after the team traded Kenny Pickett to Las Vegas. The depth chart order was clear: Flacco’s experience first, Gabriel’s development second, and Sanders as a distant third. His status underscores Cleveland’s cautious timeline, one that values growth over rushing a rookie into action.The Browns will open their season against Joe Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals with Sanders set to watch from the sidelines. For him, the early NFL journey is about absorbing lessons, not headline moments. “Obviously, I feel like I can improve in a lot of areas,” Sanders admitted. “Every day was a new day, every day you learn different things and life lessons that you learn in every situation.”Still, pressure could mount if Flacco falters or Gabriel struggles to adjust. Fans might clamor for Sanders sooner than expected. Yet for now, Cleveland seems determined to let him develop at his own pace. If patience holds, 2025 may become the year Sanders proves he’s ready to step into the Browns’ future.Also Read: What can we expect from Travis Hunter this season and why Jaguars believe he’s a game-changer","Shedeur Sanders entered the NFL with plenty of attention, but fans eager to see him take the field for the Cleveland Browns may have to wait.

Travis Hunter brings versatility and unpredictability to Jaguars’ roster



Travis Hunter’s role could reshape Jaguars’ 2025 season



The Jacksonville Jaguars enter their season opener against the Carolina Panthers carrying both questions and promise. At the heart of the intrigue is rookie sensation Travis Hunter, the second overall pick in the 2025 draft, who is poised to become the NFL’s first true two-way player in decades. With new leadership on the sidelines and a generational talent on the field, the Jaguars are betting big on a future that looks far from ordinary.When general manager James Gladstone selected Travis Hunter, he did so with a vision that stretched beyond traditional football roles. “We expect him to be who we know him to be, and that’s someone who impacts both sides of the football,” Gladstone explained.That impact lies in his ability to keep opponents guessing. One week Hunter may dominate as a wide receiver, the next he could lock down the secondary as a cornerback—or, more likely, some unpredictable blend of the two. This strategic ambiguity forces defenses and offenses alike to prepare for multiple possibilities, giving Jacksonville a rare tactical advantage.The Jaguars showcased glimpses of that strategy in the preseason. Hunter played 18 snaps against the Pittsburgh Steelers, splitting time between offense and defense.Most notably, he lined up predominantly in the slot, providing quarterback Trevor Lawrence with a dynamic option across the middle of the field. His quickness in space and precise route-running echoed his days at Colorado, making him an immediate mismatch for defenders.For head coach Liam Coen, who makes his NFL debut alongside coordinators Grant Udinski and Anthony Campanile, the season ahead is about execution and adaptability. Hunter’s unique role amplifies that mission. “You want to go out and execute what you do best in the first game,” Coen noted, acknowledging the challenge of scheming around a rookie with responsibilities on both sides of the ball.The Jaguars’ investment in Hunter was bold—they traded multiple picks, including a future first-rounder, to secure him. Yet, if he delivers on his potential, the payoff could be transformative. He doesn’t just strengthen Jacksonville’s receiving corps alongside Brian Thomas Jr.; he also offers the flexibility of essentially being two players in one. That roster versatility is invaluable over a grueling NFL season.Fantasy football managers are watching closely too. Drafted as WR32, Hunter carries sleeper potential, especially if his offensive workload grows. His ability to create separation, gain yards after the catch, and provide reliable hands makes him a candidate for breakout production—even while balancing defensive snaps.Jacksonville is a team in transition after a dismal four-win 2024 season, and its success in 2025 may well hinge on how seamlessly Travis Hunter adjusts to the demands of being a modern-day ironman. Whether he becomes the franchise cornerstone the Jaguars envision will unfold week by week, but one thing is already clear: Hunter isn’t just altering the Jaguars’ playbook—he’s challenging the very boundaries of today’s NFL.Also Read: ""Invading my beautiful sport"": NFL fans react negatively to MrBeast and Merrianne Do’s appearance, blasting YouTube’s first broadcast as a flop","Jacksonville Jaguars rookie sensation Travis Hunter is poised to become the NFL’s first true two-way player in decades.

“Today, I had an interaction with my colleague @PSchrags both on and off the air that I regret. I have apologized to Peter and taken accountability with ESPN leadership.”

Rumors swirl about Clark being on thin ice



When ESPN goes live, it usually delivers hot takes but this time, things got a little too hot. Ryan Clark, the outspoken former NFL safety turned ESPN analyst, is once again in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. After a viral on-air spat with Peter Schrager, whispers inside the network suggest Clark’s seat at ESPN may not be as secure as it once was.It all started during Friday’s episode of, when the conversation turned to CeeDee Lamb and the Cowboys-Eagles showdown. Clark cut off Schrager mid-point with a dismissive dig:Schrager didn’t let it slide. Visibly irritated, he snapped back:The tense back-and-forth created an uncomfortable silence on set and by the time clips hit social media, fans were already weighing in.To his credit, Clark didn’t try to sweep it under the rug. Later that day, he jumped on X with a public apology to Schrager and to viewers:But here’s the bigger issue, this wasn’t Clark’s first apology of 2025. Earlier this year, he found himself backtracking after other controversial comments, and now ESPN is being forced to question how many second chances one analyst should get.For a network that values both fiery personalities and professional chemistry, Clark’s unpredictability puts them in a tricky spot.According to Front Office Sports, the drama didn’t end when the cameras stopped rolling. Sources told the outlet that “bad blood” spilled off-air, leading to an “uncomfortable” confrontation behind the scenes.That off-camera tension, paired with Clark’s growing list of apologies, has sparked rumors that he may be on thin ice with ESPN executives. This is already his second high-profile misstep in a matter of months and history shows ESPN doesn’t always wait long before making changes when talent becomes a headache.For now, Clark remains on air, but his margin for error is shrinking. With millions watching and ESPN’s brand at stake, even one more viral controversy could force the network’s hand.Clark has built his reputation on being bold, blunt, and unapologetically himself, qualities that make him stand out but also stir up storms.

Randy Moss found strength in family and friends during grueling cancer battle

NFL Hall of Famer Randy Moss marked one of the biggest moments of his life on September 4, 2025, in Charlotte, North Carolina. Standing inside Atrium Health Levine Cancer Institute, Moss rang the ceremonial bell to signal the end of his treatment for cholangiocarcinoma, a rare and aggressive bile duct cancer. The journey to get there was long and brutal: a six-hour Whipple surgery, months of chemotherapy, and rounds of radiation. His wife, Lydia, never left his side, and fellow Hall of Famer Deion Sanders was a constant voice of encouragement. With their support, Moss made it through the toughest fight of his life, and now he’s set to return to ESPN’s Sunday NFL Countdown for the 2025 season. Randy Moss ’s cancer battle began in late 2024, and the reality hit hard right away. Surgery took pieces of multiple organs, and the recovery that followed was relentless. Chemotherapy days left him drained. Radiation wore him down. Through it all, Lydia was right there. She handled the quiet moments most people never see, keeping him steady when the pain spiked, when the bad news rolled in, and when hope felt like it was slipping.On Good Morning America, she talked about how being there through every appointment and every setback actually brought them closer together. “It made us stronger,” she said. For Moss, her presence was an anchor that kept him from drifting when things felt overwhelming.And then there was Sanders. Going through his own cancer battle, the Hall of Fame cornerback knew exactly what Moss was feeling. They leaned on each other, trading calls and texts, sharing advice, and swapping perspectives that only someone living it could give.That bond gave Moss another layer of strength, proof that he wasn’t in this fight alone.When Moss rang the bell on September 4, it wasn’t just a ritual. It was the sound of a man who had been cut open, broken down, and rebuilt, finally reaching the other side. Hospital staff who had cared for him lined up to celebrate, and Moss made a point to thank them. For him, that simple clang carried all the weight in the world: survival, gratitude, and relief.Now, with treatment behind him, Moss is shifting his focus back to football. He’ll return to Sunday NFL Countdown this season, bringing the same sharp takes and energy fans have missed. But this comeback isn’t just about television. It’s about showing what perseverance looks like, what leaning on loved ones can do, and how even in the darkest battles, there is a way through.For fans, athletes, and anyone fighting their own uphill climb, Randy Moss’s story lands close to home. He didn’t just beat the odds. He rang the bell and walked back into the spotlight, ready for the next chapter.Also Read: Ulysses Bentley IV: Colts' new RB weapon with a name made to stand out set for Week 1 battle against Dolphins","Randy Moss is set to return to ESPN's Sunday NFL Countdown for the 2025 season.

From Calder glory to Olympic dreams



The Olympic hopes of Montreal Canadiens defenseman Lane Hutson, fresh off his Calder Trophy win, have sparked debate following his father’s remarks. Despite his breakthrough season, Hutson was not among the 44 players invited to the U.S. Olympic Orientation Camp, igniting speculation about where his international career may head next. That speculation only deepened after comments made by his father quickly went viral.For many, Hutson’s absence from the camp roster was puzzling. Names like Adam Fox, Charlie McAvoy, Seth Jones, Luke Hughes, and Zach Werenski headlined the invited defensemen, yet the league’s brightest young blue-liner was missing. The surprise omission fueled conversations around the Canadiens star, especially after his father suggested he could represent Canada due to family roots in Manitoba.That claim, however, does not hold ground. Olympic rules make Hutson ineligible to play for Canada, despite the lineage. His agent, Sean Coffey, was quick to clarify the controversy, noting that the remarks were pulled from a short clip of a much longer interview.“It’s easy to take a 60-minute interview and turn it into a 15-second clip for clicks,” Coffey explained, stressing that neither Hutson nor his father hold animosity toward USA Hockey.Hutson remains focused on the NHL season ahead but has made his Olympic ambitions clear. “There are some great players who play for USA Hockey and great NHL players going to that. I wish them the best and hopefully they enjoy the camp. For me, I’ve got a season to get ready for and I look forward to it,” Hutson said. “I’d love to play [at the Olympics] but you never know what could happen… if the opportunity presents itself, it’s definitely something I’d love to do. ”His rapid rise has already placed him in elite company—becoming the first Canadiens player to win the Calder Trophy since Ken Dryden in 1972. Whether or not he makes it to the next Olympic stage, Lane Hutson’s name is firmly cemented among the NHL’s most exciting young stars.Also Read: NHL’s latest eligibility rule change could fast-track Penguins prospect Ben Kindel into pro hockey next season","Montreal Canadiens defenseman Lane Hutson was not invited to the U.S. Olympic Orientation Camp.

Connor McDavid’s ambitious outlook draws a stark divide with Matthew Tkachuk ’s proven championship mentality



Connor McDavid’s Personal Ambitions Add More Uncertainty



The Edmonton Oilers’ faithful are still reeling from the heartbreak of back-to-back Stanley Cup losses, and now a new concern has emerged: the Connor McDavid contract impasse. For a franchise desperate to lift its first Cup in decades, securing their captain should feel like the natural next step. Yet McDavid’s personal ambitions, paired with the team’s recent shortcomings, hint at a widening gap between player and organization.The 2025 Stanley Cup Finals exposed the Oilers’ vulnerabilities. Injuries to Zach Hyman and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins left Edmonton short-handed, while their goaltending unit faltered against Florida’s veteran Sergei Bobrovsky. Stuart Skinner and Calvin Pickard struggled under the spotlight, leaving the Oilers heavily dependent on McDavid to deliver.But Florida’s edge went beyond health and goaltending—it was culture. Matthew Tkachuk summed it up bluntly after hoisting the Cup: “Our team was a team. When things were getting hard for them, they looked to one guy. But our team does it collectively. And that’s why we’re lifting the Stanley Cup right now, because we’re a team and not a bunch of individuals.”The Panthers thrived on balance and chemistry, while the Oilers leaned on brilliance from a single superstar.That reliance, however dazzling at times, proved costly when McDavid alone couldn’t carry the weight.Amid contract negotiations, McDavid’s comments have sparked unease. He recently said, “I want to prove that scoring 50 or 60 is not a one-off. I have had 50 goals, and I have had 100 assists, and I like the goals a little bit more.”For fans, those words are unsettling. While chasing individual milestones enhances McDavid’s legendary status, the Oilers faithful crave a leader fixated on the Cup. Without alignment between his aspirations and the franchise’s urgent needs, Edmonton risks wasting its prime years with one of the NHL ’s greatest talents.Meanwhile, Florida seems intent on building a dynasty. Veterans like Brad Marchand and Tkachuk are committed, extensions are being secured, and the locker room chemistry remains unrivaled. That cohesion may continue to keep the Panthers ahead, unless the Oilers can match their sense of unity.For now, the Oilers’ future hinges on whether Connor McDavid decides to chase personal glory—or lead Edmonton to the championship it desperately seeks.Also Read: Connor McDavid’s future Oilers contract may focus on historic annual value instead of maximum term extension",Connor McDavid’s ambitious outlook draws a stark divide with Matthew Tkachuk ’s proven championship mentality.
