NEW DELHI: Sri Lanka sensation Kamindu Mendis has etched his name in the history books, becoming the first-ever batsman to score fifty or more in eight consecutive Test matches since making his debut.Meanwhile, Viv Richards holds the record for the most consecutive Test matches with a fifty, achieving this feat in 11 matches.The stylish left-hander achieved this remarkable feat during Sri Lanka’s second Test match against New Zealand at Galle International Stadium on Thursday.Coming in at number five, Mendis once again displayed his exceptional batting acumen, notching up his fifth half-century in Test cricket .The milestone came as Sri Lanka recovered from a shaky start in their first innings. After captain Dhananjaya de Silva won the toss and chose to bat, Sri Lanka’s early innings suffered a setback with Pathum Nissanka dismissed cheaply.However, veteran campaigners Dimuth Karunaratne and Dinesh Chandimal steadied the innings with a crucial 122-run partnership for the second wicket.Karunaratne's unfortunate run out provided New Zealand with a breakthrough, but Chandimal continued his fine form to bring up a century before being dismissed.It was Kamindu Mendis’ arrival that solidified Sri Lanka’s position. Alongside Angelo Mathews , Mendis guided the team past the 300-mark, scoring a sublime 51* by the end of day one, with Sri Lanka finishing on 306 for three.Mendis' incredible consistency has been a defining feature of his game, starting with his fifty against Australia in Galle in 2022, followed by awe-inspiring scores against Bangladesh and England earlier this year.His latest half-century against New Zealand not only helped Sri Lanka post a formidable total but also saw him break a world record that stood untouched for years.Mendis’ remarkable run is a clear sign of his growing stature in world cricket, making him one of Sri Lanka’s most reliable middle-order batsmen.","Kamindu Mendis becomes first batsman to score fifty or more in eight consecutive Test matches since making his debut.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s star fast bowler Shaheen Afridi has found himself in the spotlight after taking a subtle dig at Gary Kirsten 's comments regarding his workload management.Kirsten, Pakistan’s white-ball head coach, had recently expressed concerns, noting that Afridi had bowled three times more overs than any other fast bowler globally in the last 18 months.""Fast bowlers are always under immense pressure to deliver and win games.When we look at our key resources, Shaheen Afridi and Naseem Shah have carried the bulk of the workload for Pakistan across all formats. Shaheen has bowled three times more overs than any other fast bowler in the world over the last 18 months. That's alarming- you're bound to wear him down eventually,"" Kirsten had earlier said.Afridi brushed off these concerns in a recent interview as he told Samaa TV , ""First of all, if you are saying that I have bowled the most in the world (among bowlers in Test cricket )… but if you look in the past, all our legends bowlers Wasim Akram Waqar Younis , at that time there was no workload issue.""However, Shaheen's comments didn’t sit well with fans on social media, many of whom pointed out the difference in fitness and performance levels between him and the former greats.Some fans highlighted the dip in Shaheen’s pace, from 150 km/h to around 128 km/h, questioning his claims about workload not being an issue.One fan remarked, “They had peak fitness and were used to bowl 30 overs in a single day of test match with consistent 140+ pace while modern day bowlers like you can only last 4 overs of barely 135+ so there is literally no comparison.”","Shaheen Afridi takes a subtle dig at Gary Kirsten's comments regarding his workload management.

NEW DELHI: Back in April 2023, Lionel Messi experienced a difficult night as Paris Saint-Germain ( PSG ) fans booed him during their 1-0 defeat to Lyon at the Parc des Princes in a perhaps once-in-a-lifetime incident.It was PSG’s second consecutive loss, leaving them just six points ahead of Lens and Marseille in Ligue 1 .Despite Messi's immense reputation, many home fans expressed their frustration by booing his name during the pre-match lineup announcements.The reasons for the booing stemmed largely from PSG's Champions League struggles. After being knocked out by Bayern Munich earlier in the season, many fans remained frustrated by the club’s failure to secure European glory, a trophy that continues to elude them.Messi, despite his 18 goals in all competitions that season, was singled out by some fans who questioned his commitment to the club.With his contract set to expire that summer, there were widespread rumours of a return toBarcelona , fueling doubts about whether he truly wanted to stay in France.For some supporters, parting ways with Messi would free up resources to bolster the squad for future campaigns.Not everyone was pleased with the fans' actions. French football legend Thierry Henry , appearing as a pundit, voiced his disappointment at the treatment Messi received, even suggesting that the Argentine should consider returning to Barcelona.Henry emphasized Messi’s contributions, including his 13 goals and 13 assists in Ligue 1, calling him ""the current best player in the world.""PSG manager Christophe Galtier also acknowledged the difficulty of hearing the boos.He admitted that while expectations were high for Messi to deliver match-winning moments, it was challenging to listen to the jeers aimed at a player who had contributed significantly to the team’s success.

Sanjay Manjrekar 'educates' Rohit Sharma with a piece of statistic,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/sanjay-manjrekar-educates-rohit-sharma-with-a-piece-of-statistic/articleshow/113754827.cms,"Ravindra Jadeja, left, and Rohit Sharma (Getty Images)

Former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar has raised a question mark over Rohit Sharma not using the services of Ravindra Jadeja against left-handed batsmen early and shared a piece of statistic that, he says, ""needs to be shown"" to the India captain.On a rain-shortened opening day of the second Test against Bangladesh in Kanpur, only 35 overs were possible after India won the toss and opted to bowl for the first time in nine years in a home Test.Left-arm spinner Jadeja was the only specialist bowler who was not asked to bowl, while pacer Akash Deep was the pick of the Indian bowlers with his 2 for 34. Veteran off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin took the other wicket to fall on Friday.Bangladesh, who trail the two-match series 1-0, fought their way to 107 for 3. Mominum Haque was batting on 50 and Mushifqur Rahim on 6 when rain stopped play.With Bangladesh under pressure when the third wicket fell at the score of 80 post lunch, Manjrekar believes Rohit could have brought Jadeja in, while admitting that it was only logical to have an off-spinner bowling at the two left-handers on the crease.However, Manjrekar shared a statistic about Jadeja's record against former England captain and left-handed opener Alastair Cook to make his point.""Rohit needs to be shown this stat- JADEJA vs COOK, 2016 series: In 8 inngs, got him out 6 times, conceded just 75 runs. Rohit tends to not bowl Jadeja early when there are left handers out there,"" Manjrekar posted on 'X'.After the end of day's play, Manjrekar elaborated on his point during his analysis in a chat on ESPNcricinfo.""Every captain has an approach, keeping in mind the bowlers he has. It's nothing wrong because captains tend to trust some bowlers more. I have noticed this, not particularly in this series, when it comes to spin, Rohit favours Ashwin a bit more,"" said the former batsman.""Yes, he did have a reason here because there were two left-handers, but match-ups should merely be guidelines. As you see in this series, in the previous match, Shakib Al Hasan had troubled Rishabh Pant, and there was also a dropped-catch scenario. This is an ongoing trend even in Test cricket, but you have a quality bowler like Jadeja, who has a good record against left-handers.""Remember, he dismissed Alastair Cook six times in eight innings. So not giving him the ball at all was baffling,"" he added.",Rohit Sharma did not use Ravindra Jadeja against left-handed batsmen.

Selectors keen to assess pacer's recovery, after which he could travel with India during NZ Tests

KANPUR: The national selectors have included pace bowler Mayank Yadav in a special camp at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) ahead of the T20I series against Bangladesh starting October 6.The camp is limited to a few players, namely Hardik Pandya , Riyan Parag and Abhishek Sharma.The 21-year-old from Delhi has been at the NCA after the IPL because of a recurring side strain.Mayank burst on to the scene in the last IPL as he clocked over 156 kmph in his first two matches. The selection committee, led by Ajit Agarkar , has identified him as one for the future as they look to build a strong pool of pace bowlers.""Mayank hasn't complained of any pain over the last month or so. He is bowling full tilt at the NCA. The selectors are interested to see how ready he is for international cricket. With the long Test season ahead, the selectors are keen on trying new faces for the T20Is against Bangladesh. Pandya has not played competitive cricket for nearly a couple of months. Even Abhishek needs some quality practice,"" a BCCI source said.The selectors are expected to rest Test specialists for the T20I series, opening up an opportunity to try out new players, keeping the T20 World Cup in 2026 in mind.TOI has learnt that the NCA team has charted a roadmap for Mayank's comeback. For now, he has been asked to start with T20 cricket.He hasn't been cleared to play Ranji Trophy for Delhi yet. ""Mayank is bowling close to 20 overs with the white ball in three separate spells in a day. There is a strong chance of selectors picking him for the Bangladesh series after seeing him in the camp at NCA. Agarkar is slated to travel to Bengaluru to attend the inauguration of the new NCA,"" the source said.While Mayank is yet to receive a clearance for Ranji Trophy, it is understood that selectors may ask him to travel with the Indian team during the three-Test series against New Zealand at home next month.""The selectors don't want him to be restricted to just the T20 format. Therefore, they want to carefully monitor his progress. India head coach Gautam Gambhir and bowling coach Morne Morkel rate Mayank highly since their time at Lucknow Super Giants ,"" he said.With Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj set to be rested for the T20I series, Arshdeep Singh is likely to lead the attack.

4th ODI: England hammer Australia to square series after Liam Livingstone fireworks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/4th-odi-england-hammer-australia-to-square-series-after-liam-livingstone-fireworks/articleshow/113753991.cms,"Liam Livingstone (Reuters Photo)

England annihilated Australia by 186 runs in a rain-shortened ODI at Lord's with Harry Brook and Liam Livingstone laying waste to the visitors attack before Matthew Potts took four wickets as the hosts tied the series at 2-2 on Friday.Captain Brook scored a dazzling 87 and Livingstone wrought havoc with the fastest ODI fifty at Lord's on the way to 62 in 27 balls as England posted a daunting 312-5 from their 39 overs.World champions Australia, whose run of 14 successive ODI victories ended in Durham this week, began their reply in menacing fashion but capitulated in the evening chill under the floodlights to 126 all out.They were 68 without loss in the ninth over but after Travis Head was bowled by Brydon Carse for 34 the Australian innings disintegrated. Adil Rashid put them out of their misery in the 25th over after Potts took a career-best four for 38 as England recorded their second-biggest ODI victory in terms of runs against their arch-rivals.Australia had led the series 2-0 but it will now be decided in Sunday's finale in Bristol.Rain caused a two-hour delay, reducing the match to a 39-over each affair and England's innings began at a crawl with Australian pace duo Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood both beating the bat at will in the gloom.England were a modest 35 without loss after the eight-over powerplay and when Phil Salt (22) and Will Jacks (10) were both caught by Marnus Labuschagne at point off Hazlewood and Mitchell March respectively, Australia were on top.Brook, fresh from his match-winning century at Durham, was given out on 17 after feathering a Starc delivery off his legs to wicketkeeper Josh Inglis but reprieved as a review showed the ball had grounded before Inglis pouched it.Boos rang out in a reminder of Australia's last Lord's visit in the 2023 Ashes when keeper Alex Carey controversially ran out Jonny Bairstow and was abused by members.As the sun came out, Brook ignited England's innings with a ferocious assault -- reaching his fourth ODI 50 in 37 balls and adding 79 for the third wicket with opener Ben Duckett.Duckett launched Adam Zampa for six shortly before reaching his 50 but was out for 63 after top-edging the legspinner.Brook continued to sparkle though and was on course for a rapid century before falling on 87 from 58 balls including 11 fours and a six. Jamie Smith went in the next over for 39 to leave England 241-5 with eight overs remaining.But Livingstone's onslaught left the Australians reeling, especially Starc who he struck for 28 in the last over of the innings, including four huge sixes, to power England past 300.It was the most expensive men's ODI over ever bowled by an Australian bowler.When Marsh and Head put on 66 in eight overs, with Head looking especially dangerous, the chase looked on.But Head swung and missed and was bowled by Carse, Steve Smith went cheaply, nicking Potts behind to Jamie Smith for five and Jofra Archer produced an unplayable delivery to bowl skipper Marsh for 28.The wind had completely gone out of Australia's sails and when Carse struck twice in four balls in the 15th over -- removing Inglis and Labuschagne -- Australia were in freefall.Potts then turned the screws with three more wickets as only four Australian batsmen reached double figures.""We were a bit off. Fair play to England, they put us under pressure with the bat. They outplayed us,"" Marsh said.",England beat Australia by 186 runs in a rain-shortened ODI at Lord's.

Rickelton then took Matthew Humphreys over cow corner and smoked Ben White over deep midwicket. He reached his maiden T20 fifty off 30 balls.White went for another couple of sixes in the 11th over and South Africa's run rate passed 10.Hendricks reached his fifty off 31 balls by hitting Hand for six over deep square leg and was out in the next over, pinned in front by Craig Young for 51 off 33.Rickelton was caught in the following over, the 14th, for 76 off 48.Rickelton and Hendricks scored 136 together and brought the run rate required down to less than a run a ball.Matthew Breetzke and captain Aiden Markram had no trouble knocking off the last runs and preserving South Africa's unbeaten record against Ireland in T20s.Ireland started well when Ross Adair took a six and two boundaries off Lizaad Williams in the first over, and Curtis Campher and Harry Tector carried them through the powerplay.Campher and Neil Rock then combined for 59 in nearly seven overs until Rock was bowled by leg-spinner Nqabayomzi Peter.Campher, dropped on 17, was caught at the second chance by Ottneil Baartman on the boundary, but only after he'd hit 49 off 36.Ireland was 169 for 5 going into the last over but Kruger deflated its charge by bowling a brilliant three-wicket maiden over.The Irish moved the tour to the United Arab Emirates because it was cheaper to organise here than at home.The teams play one more T20I on Sunday, followed by three one-day internationals.",South Africa beat Ireland by eight wickets in a Twenty20 in the United Arab Emirates.

NEW DELHI: Legendary Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar minced no words in slamming English media for their persistent criticism of Indian pitches prior to a Test series. The former cricketer expressed his displeasure without holding back his words.While commentating on the first day of the second Test between India and Bangladesh in Kanpur, Gavaskar launched a scathing attack on a section of the English media, labeling them as ""moaners"" and ""crybabies"" for their incessant complaints about Indian pitches that provide spin.The morning session on Friday featured a compilation of Ashwin's outstanding hundred from the opening Test match. When Ashwin arrived at the crease batting at number eight, India were in a precarious position.He proceeded to score his sixth century in Test cricket , establishing a new record for the seventh-wicket partnership with Ravindra Jadeja , who contributed 86 runs. Together, they rescued India from a challenging situation.Following his exceptional performance with the bat, Ashwin further showcased his skills by claiming six wickets in the second innings. His all-round brilliance was instrumental in India's emphatic 280-run victory.Ashwin's remarkable century at Chepauk marked his second ton at the venue. His previous century at the same ground came against England earlier this year, when India required crucial runs on a challenging Chepauk surface that provided a significant turn.Gavaskar, while praising Ashwin's exceptional performance, recalled the English media's criticism of the Chepauk pitch during that match against England.""He (Ashwin) actually said in the press conference that you can get a hundred if you apply yourself. So he walked the talk when the moaners were going on saying 'you can't bat here'. Saying and doing all the things like crybabies, typical English media stuff, where they only talk about Indian pitches,"" Gavaskar said.","Legendary Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar slams English media for their persistent criticism of Indian pitches prior to a Test series.

Top Picks For You Brittany Brown wins big at Athlos NYC: A look at the $663,000 prize distribution

NEW DELHI: Gabby Thomas , the Olympic 200m champion from the United States, was outperformed by Brittany Brown , the bronze medallist from Paris, on Thursday. This race was part of the all-women Athlos athletics meeting in New York.Brown overtook Thomas in the final meters, securing a win with a time of 22.18 seconds. Thomas finished closely behind at 22.21 seconds.Gabrielle ‘Gabby’ Thomas faced significant challenges leading up to her participation in Athlos NYC , the first-ever women-only track contest independent of the Olympics .She admitted, “Honestly, it’s one of the biggest challenges I think I’ve ever had to face.” Competing in her signature 200m event tonight after her recent success in Paris, and choosing the track over rest, was clearly taxing for her.Despite the loss, she shared candid thoughts on collaborating with Alexis Ohanian , the visionary behind Athlos NYC. Earlier this year, Gabby and Alexis announced Athlos NYC 2024, shaping this historical event through their joint efforts.The meeting saw participation from four Paris Olympics gold medallists and was organized by entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian, who is married to retired tennis star Serena Williams Gabby expressed her appreciation for Ohanian, saying, “He didn’t know anything about track, and now he’s using track lingo when he’s talking about, you know, our sport in the races, which I really appreciate.” Balancing her track duties, Gabby had to step away from her essential role during the organization of the contest. She revealed more about this tonight.Reflecting on her direct involvement during the Olympics, Gabby explained, “There was a lot of stuff kind of influx when this was going on so all the details weren’t kind of hashed out so definitely was focused on the Olympics for the most part and then, you know everything kind of came together as it should.” She acknowledged that in her absence, Alexis Ohanian took charge, a move she fully supports.A total of 36 women competed across six events at the Athlos meeting. The winners received $60,000 each from a total prize pool of $663,000.That doubles the prize money awarded in the Diamond League final two weeks ago.Gabby, a three-time Olympic champion, had high praise for the Reddit co-founder. Ohanian has created a competition where each athlete is guaranteed a prize. Part of the overall revenue is allocated for this, along with significant media coverage. The prize money for the champion, an impressive $60,000, surpasses the Diamond League offerings.Highlighting Ohanian's contributions, Gabby once stated, “You see it. I mean, he [Alexis Ohanian] really doubled the prize money of the Diamond League, and that’s fantastic because he saw what we deserve, and he doesn’t want to stop there.” These sentiments capture Ohanian's vision for Athlos NYC, with Gabby Thomas being a central figure in its development.Puerto Rico's Jasmine Camacho-Quinn secured the top spot in the 100m hurdles with a time of 12.36 seconds. She finished ahead of Alaysha Johnson, who recorded a time of 12.43 seconds, and Paris gold medallist Masai Russell , who clocked 12.44 seconds.Marileidy Paulino from the Dominican Republic won the 400m event, finishing in 49.59 seconds.

Seamer impresses with 2/34 on slow Kanpur wicket;

Bangladesh

end rain-hit Day One at 107/3

KANPUR: As the two teams reached the venue on the first day of the second Test, the Green Park Stadium pitch and the weather here on Friday had everyone guessing.Overnight rain, which resulted in an hour-long delay at the start, and overcast conditions prompted India captain Rohit Sharma to retain his three-man pace attack as he chose to field first.Bangladesh, though, went in with three spinners, although their recent success has been engineered by an emerging pace attack.Going by the statements from the two camps in the preceding days, it was difficult to assume how the pitch would play out. In the 35 overs of play possible - before a heavy downpour cut short the day's play - India's newest seam-bowling find, Akash Deep , showed he was the one most aware of the conditions. His immaculate spell of 2/34 was the highlight for India as Bangladesh ended the day at 107/3 on a relatively benign surface.Bangladesh rode largely on Mominul Haque 's rather composed, yet unbeaten 40 off 81 balls and captain Najmul Hossain Shanto's 31. Ashwin's arm ball sent Shanto packing but the duo threatened to put on a frustrating partnership for India.When Jasprit Bumrah 's first delivery of the day reached wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant on the bounce, one could feel the collective gasp in the Indian team. For the rest of the day, the ball largely died in Pant's gloves. India decided against giving home boy Kuldeep Yadav a run in this game.Yet, Rohit was forced to bring Ravichandran Ashwin into the attack against the two left-handed openers in the eighth over of the match. By then, the clouds had given way to strong sunshine.To Bumrah and Siraj's credit, they didn't let Zakir Hasan get off the mark even as Shadman Islam was scoring fluently off Siraj. The new ball did beat the bat a few times but there was nothing menacing for the openers to contend with.Things started to look sharper when Akash started his spell in the ninth over. Like he had mentioned two days before the match, Akash wasted no time in going around the wicket to the left-handers. This has always been his Plan 'A'.The first two balls angled in towards Zakir's pads before the third ball left him from the same spot for Yashasvi Jaiswal to complete a sharp catch at gully. Zakir trudged off with a duck to his name. Four overs later, Akash cut short Islam's fluent innings of 24 with a ball that nipped back sharply to trap him in front of the stumps.Akash was all about consistently hitting an impeccable length on a surface that didn't have much pace in it for the faster bowlers. Given Akash's unending toil on such surfaces in the domestic circuit over the last five years, the difference was apparent.For once, Bumrah was a tad too wide of offstump to the left-handers. And Siraj, hampered by the lack of zip off the surface, either over-pitched for easy drives or bowled too straight on the pads. Siraj's desperation resulted in India losing a review to an LBW shout.With Akash deriving whatever little the pitch had to offer and the Shanto-Mominul pair coming out with positive intent, the contest suddenly turned spicy.On offer were some crunchy drives down the ground off Bumrah and Siraj while the backward point boundary was tested with reverse sweeps and deft cuts off Ashwin.",Seamer impresses with 2/34 on slow Kanpur wicket.

KOLKATA: Pointless in their first two games, the Juggernauts are yet to roll in this season of Indian Super League (ISL). Come Saturday though they have a chance to arrest the slide when they host a red-hot Red Miners at Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar.But it will be an uphill task for Odisha FC as the defensive woes will continue to haunt Sergio Lobera ’s boys in the third game of season 11, where they will be a up against a side who have travelled to the Temple City on the back of consecutive wins against quality opponents – FC Goa (away) and Mumbai City FC (home), both former champions.Historically Jamshedpur FC hold the upper hand over OFC with eight wins in 14 ISL matches but Kalinga Warriors enjoy better records over the Men of Steel in recent past, having won three of their previous four games.However, both Carlos Delgado and Saviour Gama’s long absence through injuries will keep Odisha on their toes for their first points this season. And to make matters worse, pivotal midfielder Hugo Boumous is not fully fit.Enduring a poor start to the campaign, Lobera, however, reiterated his trust in his wards for a turnaround. “This is my work. I need to work with my players and give them confidence. I need to be close to them, especially in difficult situations. I trust my players; I believe in them 200%. We are going to improve,” Lobera said during an interaction on Friday.Asked about their gameplan for the opponents who are on a two-game winning streak, the Spaniard said, “They have had a great start, picking up six points against tough opponents. They are a very balanced and physical team, but for us, the focus is always on ourselves. We need to learn from our previous games and be ready for the challenge. It’s a great opportunity for us to perform at home.”Addressing concerns about Boumous, who looked to be struggling towards the end of the last match against leaders Punjab FC, Lobera said. “We will assess Hugo in training today (Friday afternoon), but I’m optimistic he will be available. Unfortunately, Saviour Gama is not fit for this game.”Logging full points from first two games, with the last being a 3-2 comeback win against the defending champions, JFC head coach Khalid Jamil is confident of a good showing against the home side. At the same time Jamil warned his boys of any complacency against a “good team under an experienced coach”.“Everyone has worked really hard, that’s why we have won the games. We must keep going with the same spirit. It’s better for us to think about the next game,” Jamil said on Friday before adding, “It will not be an easy match. They have a good team and an experienced coach. We must be alert and make sure there is no complacency.”Asked about their good start to the campaign, Jamil said, “We should think about only next match. Every match is different, and we need to work hard every time to make sure that we get full points.”",Odisha FC host red-hot Red Miners at Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar.

Disappointing when we gift goals to opposition: Chennaiyin coach Coyle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/disappointing-when-we-gift-goals-to-opposition-chennaiyin-coach-coyle/articleshow/113740232.cms,"Action during the Chennaiyin FC-Mohammedan Sporting game in Chennai

CHENNAI: Chennaiyin FC head coach Owen Coyle expressed his disappointment and frustration after a costly defensive error led to the 0-1 loss to Mohammedan Sporting in the Indian Super League clash here on Thursday.At the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium , Chennaiyin were the architects of their downfall and suffered their first defeat of the ISL season. A miscommunication between CFC goalkeeper Samik Mitra and centre-back Laldinpuia meant that Lalremsanga Fanai had an open goal to score in the 39th minute – it eventually proved to be the winner for the League debutants.“It was a very avoidable goal, which is doubly frustrating because we had started the game very well. There is no doubt that there were a couple of defensive errors. It is hugely disappointing when you gift opportunities (to the opposition),” said Coyle in the post-match press conference.A few minutes prior to the goal, the hosts escaped punishment as the visitors failed to make the most of a defensive howler. “We certainly did not deserve to lose the game, it was self-inflicted. The goal should never have been lost (conceded) at this elite level. If we are going to make those types of errors, we are going to get punished severely,” added the Scotsman.While Coyle admitted that the blunder at the back cost Chennaiyin dearly, he threw his weight behind Laldinpuia and Samik, who were involved in the mix-up.“Nobody has a higher opinion on Dinpuia than me. But he knows that he can perform a lot better, as could a number of others. We have lost the game, and we have lost it together. When we lose, we lose together. When we win, we win together. It is not about a portion of blame, it is not Dinpuia’s fault or Samik’s fault. We all take responsibility, and we will stick together. What is important is that we rectify the mistakes and not allow them to happen again.”Coyle said that the players, most of whom are new to the club, should build a better on-field “rapport” as the season progresses. “That is with everybody because it is a new group. But that being said, it cannot be given as an excuse for the goal. You are right about the miscommunication. If they are not sure, the defenders have to clear their lines. If Samik had held his position and Dinpuia had passed it back, there would have been no danger,” said Coyle.",Chennaiyin FC lost 0-1 to Mohammedan Sporting in the Indian Super League clash.

Defence lets CFC down in first loss

CHENNAI: During the pre-match press conference ahead of the Mohammedan Sporting clash, Chennaiyin FC 's head coach Owen Coyle highlighted that defence was an area which needed improvement. By the end of Thursday, Coyle was proved right as the defence let him down at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium and Md Sporting snatched their maiden ISL victory.Centre-back Laldinpuia 's mistake in the 39th minute helped Md Sporting score the only goal of the match that came via a crisp finish from Lalremsanga Fanai .While Chennaiyin showed moments of brilliance towards the end of the game, they conceded a penalty courtesy Laldinpuia, who had a pathetic game. Cesar Manzoki Lobi failed to convert the spotkick and Chennaiyin breathed a sigh of relief. Soon, in the third minute of stoppage time, Lukas Brambilla finished a quick counterattacking move, but his shot from inside the box was cleared off the goal line by the Md Sporting defence.Earlier, CFC started the game by playing high-pressing football and looked potent in most of the moves. In-form midfielder Connor Shields combined well with striker Irfan Yadwad, but the latter failed to find the back of the net on multiple occasions. While CFC could not capitalise on most of the chances, Md Sporting seized on their opportunity which was gifted to them by Laldinpuia. Lack of communication between goalkeeper Samik Mitra and the defender resulted in Fanai's tapped left-footed finish from the centre of the box.The goal boosted Md Sporting's confidence as they looked a far more settled side, while CFC were often left frustrated. The home side looked desperate in the second half as Coyle made four changes inside the first 20 minutes. The Kolkata giants' defence, though, stood resolute and it was a disappointing end for CFC, who played their first home match in front of a 9000-plus partisan crowd.",Defence lets CFC down in first loss of ISL season.

For Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan , the ATP Tour doubles title in Hangzhou marks a sort of Jeev 2.0 — not only has his game has matured and become more solid since he won his maiden title at his home town of Chennai, but he is also able to understand better the significance of triumph and what it means to his career going forward.The 35-year-old left-hander claimed the ATP 250 Series event in Hangzhou, China, in the company of his friend and fellow Tamil Nadu player Vijay Sundar Prashanth , beating Constantin Frantzen and Hendrik Jebens of Germany 4-6, 7-6 (5), 10-7 in the hard-court final on Sunday.Jeevan’s first title had come in 2017 at the Chennai Open in the company of veteran Davis Cupper and Australian Open Grand Slam champion Rohan Bopanna.“I think (I am) a little bit more experienced. I remember the first title was a little sooner than I thought,” Jeevan, who has climbed 27 spots on the ATP ladder to be ranked 86 in doubles, told The Times of India.“After switching to doubles, Rohan and I had won Chennai in 2017 and I didn't really know where that title was going to take me, you know.“I was just kind of excited to be playing Grand Slams , because that title happened to push me into the top 100. And ironically, this title has also pushed me into the top 100.“But I would say, (in) 2017 I was kind of naive without any real path to move forward after achieving a 250 title. But now, I'm feeling much calmer after winning a title of this stage, because I have a set partner and I have schedule which works in our favour.“And I'm healthy, I'm able to see that there is definitely going to be an exciting path to be playing with the same partner and consistently at a higher level.”It has been an eventful year for him so far, and Jeevan, wiser with experience, feels things are falling in place for him.“This year has not been very easy, there have been a lot of ups and downs. But very happy to be playing with Vijay, who's one of my closest friends, not just on tour, but in life,” he said.“We've been patient as a team. We've been learning how to get to our best ability together.“As the as far as the emotions are concerned, I think in goal setting, it was very clear for me that this was going to be the year for me to build something, because I'm always looking at long term with my partners.“I have only played with a handful of people my whole career. So with Vijay, we are just building something to give ourselves an opportunity to be, you know, a set team in the Grand Slams next year.”A long-term partnership has become a rare phenomenon in modern doubles and Jeevan looks at it practically.“A lot of teams are looking to build partnerships together. You can see (that) even with the Double Dream of India. So many teams are sticking together, and we're just trying to figure out what best combinations are going to get us all into the Grand Slams,” he said.“Today was a good day for Vijay and me, but the season has been good for Balaji and even Yuki has been doing very well.“The ideal goal for this program is to see all the players sitting at the Slam, taking a group picture.”","Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan wins ATP Tour doubles title in Hangzhou.

When we did not have our respective partners earlier this year, we spoke to each other and then had a mutual agreement to join forces,"" Vijay Sundar added.The pair did not enjoy much success at the start and at one point they lost five first-round matches on the trot on the Challenger circuit . Still, they kept believing in themselves and their work behind the scenes has done the trick.""When we joined hands, we knew that this was going to be a long partnership. Although we lost a few close matches early, it did not bother us much as we knew that wins were not far away. We did not put pressure on us and waited for the right moment.""The next goal for the Indian pair will be to carry forward the momentum and book a place at the Australian Open next year. Vijay made his Grand Slam debut in Australia earlier this year by partnering Anirudh, while Jeevan could not make it to any of the majors this year.

I'm not going to lie -- I have felt this way a few times already. Sometimes I don't feel motivated at all. But as I've said many, many times, I play my best tennis when I smile and enjoy it on court.

This match took place mere weeks after Alcaraz had convincingly defeated Djokovic at Wimbledon, where he successfully defended his title.""I took a little break after the Olympic Games.

Probably I came here without as much energy as I thought I was going to (have),"" he said after his US Open horror show.""I have to think about it and I have to learn about it.""Second-ranked Alexander Zverev couldn't agree more with his Team Europe teammate at the Laver Cup.""The ATP doesn't care about our opinion -- it's a money business,"" said the German. ""It's the longest season in sports. It's unnecessarily long. We have an unnecessary amount of tournaments.""""We're not allowed to boycott, we get fined if we don't play tournaments"" said Zverev. ""The tour goes on without you. We need to do something about it. It's not an easy solution, but a solution which needs to be made.""Alcaraz and Zverev have a packed schedule ahead, with their seasons extending until the Davis Cup Finals in Spain, which will be held in late November.The upcoming 2025 season is set to kick off on December 27, with the United Cup tournament taking place in Australia.","Carlos Alcaraz says the tennis calendar is ""going to kill us"" in some way.

South Korean Lee Hyun Il is Sindhu's consulting coach

BENGALURU: After a disappointing Paris Olympics , PV Sindhu has a new coach, though temporarily, in former Olympian Anup Sridhar . The two-time Olympic medallist will work with the Karnataka man for the remainder of the year and the duo will sit down by the year-end to decide upon the future.Sridhar came into the picture after Sindhu's coach Indonesian Agus Dwi Santoso's contract got over after the quadrennial event.The former international player was taken on board after a successful meeting with the star player and her team. For the last three weeks, the ace shuttler, who trained at the Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy (PPBA) before Paris, has been sweating it out for almost five hours daily under the watchful eyes of Sridhar at the Gachibowli Stadium in Hyderabad. She has been involved in sparring sessions and fitness routines too. The current coaching team also includes former Korean shuttler Lee Hyun Il .Sridhar is pleased with the way the new partnership has begun and is keen to work on different aspects of Sindhu's game in the coming weeks. ""The start has been good so far. The first thing was to get her pain free, playing and moving freely on the court, which we have achieved. Now we're working on getting her speed and endurance levels up. There's a decent amount of improvement,"" Sridhar told TOI. ""I have tried to devise training programmes and routines around the areas that she's finding a little bit difficult.""The last 21 months has not been great for Sindhu as she did not win a single BWF singles title. The task is now cut out for Sridhar as her results in the next three months could prove to be the difference between a long or short-term association with Sindhu. However, the Bengaluruean is looking beyond the results.""The results are certainly important, but I wouldn't say it is the only important thing to look at. No miracles are going to be performed either by me or by anybody else, real change takes time. But I think this period is important from the point of view of how we work together, how we communicate. The working relationship will be important,"" he said.To start with, Sindhu has marked two events for next month, the Arctic Open in Finland (Oct 8-13, Super 500), and Denmark Open in Odense (Oct 15-20, Super 750). ""She's hungry to do well,"" said Sridhar NEW DELHI: PV Sindhu will have South Korean great Lee Hyun Il as her consulting coach on interim basis as she bolstered her coaching team ahead of her anticipated return to action next month.",Former Olympian Anup Sridhar will work with the Karnataka man for the remainder of the year.
