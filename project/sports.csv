Mikko Rantanen faces legal battle over Finnish military service delay

Mikko Rantanen delivers for Dallas after blockbuster trade and mega-contract

Dallas Stars forward Mikko Rantanen is in the middle of a complicated situation off the ice. In Finland, all men are required to complete mandatory military service, and prosecutors allege Rantanen failed to report on time last April. They argue his application to delay his service was filed too late, leaving him subject to a potential fine equivalent to 10–15 days of income.Mikko Rantanen’s agent, Matti Huhtamaki, has pushed back strongly, stressing that his client did nothing wrong and that “there have been mistakes that Mikko has tried to correct as soon as he received the information.” Huhtamaki added that the matter “should be left to the court” and refused further comment until proceedings conclude.The 28-year-old briefly served at the Guard Jaeger Regiment’s sports school earlier this year before being released for health reasons. While the legal uncertainty lingers, the case highlights the challenges international athletes sometimes face when balancing professional careers abroad with domestic legal and civic obligations.Despite the off-ice drama, Rantanen’s hockey career is thriving. After a trade that sent him from the Colorado Avalanche to the Carolina Hurricanes before landing in Dallas, he wasted no time committing to his new team, signing an eight-year, $96 million deal.“It was the first time I’ve been traded from Colorado and it happened quick,” Rantanen told NHL.com, explaining that he felt Dallas was the right fit after discussions with his camp and his girlfriend, Susanna.Also Read: Hockey’s own Kelce brothers?

His hat trick against Winnipeg and four-point night versus Colorado proved his ability to deliver under pressure. For the Stars, Rantanen’s consistency is exactly what they paid for, even as the Finnish court system decides his military service case.","Dallas Stars forward Mikko Rantanen is in the middle of a complicated situation off the ice.

What is the Wayne Gretzky Rule and how it changed the modern NHL forever,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/what-is-the-wayne-gretzky-rule-and-how-it-changed-the-modern-nhl-forever/articleshow/123454130.cms,"What is the Wayne Gretzky Rule (Getty Images)

The origins of the Wayne Gretzky Rule after the 2005 lockout

The lasting impact on hockey and Wayne Gretzky’s legacy

When fans hear the name Wayne Gretzky, they instantly think of records, dominance, and “The Great One’s” lasting influence on hockey. But Gretzky’s legacy extends beyond his on-ice brilliance. After the 2004–05 NHL lockout, a major rule change — later dubbed the Wayne Gretzky Rule — reshaped the way the game was played, prioritizing speed and creativity over clutching and grabbing.The NHL had reached a breaking point before the lockout, with declining scoring and slower gameplay frustrating fans. To restore excitement, the league introduced a stricter “standard of enforcement for obstruction fouls” in 2005.This rule directly targeted interference, holding, and hooking — tactics defenders had long used to slow down skilled forwards. Referees were instructed to call these penalties more aggressively, creating more power plays and forcing teams to adjust.The impact was immediate: offenses found more space to create, the pace of the game accelerated, and skill players had the freedom to shine.The Wayne Gretzky Rule wasn’t just about calling more penalties — it fundamentally changed hockey’s identity.With less obstruction, players like Sidney Crosby and Alexander Ovechkin thrived in the “new NHL,” ushering in a more dynamic era. Fans also responded positively, as higher scoring and faster action brought back excitement after the lockout.Teams had to rethink strategies too. Defensemen could no longer rely on hooking to neutralize top scorers; instead, skating ability and positioning became more important. For offensive players, the rule meant greater opportunities to showcase their creativity and speed — exactly the style Gretzky embodied during his career.Even though the rule has evolved, its influence remains. It stands as a tribute to Gretzky’s vision of hockey as a game defined by flow and finesse rather than obstruction.Also Read: “It’s a war”: Wayne Gretzky’s legacy came under fire amid Donald Trump’s controversial trade war with Canada The Wayne Gretzky Rule did more than change officiating standards — it helped redefine modern NHL hockey. By encouraging speed, skill, and offensive freedom, the league created a product more exciting for players and fans alike. In many ways, the rule is a lasting reminder that Gretzky’s impact on the game goes far beyond his records — it lives on in the way hockey is played today.","After the 2004–05 NHL lockout, a major rule change reshaped the way the game was played.

Jay Rosehill calls the trade a “pipe dream” but says Leafs should take it

Fans divided over the bold trade proposal

Former NHL enforcer Jay Rosehill stirred the pot this week with a bold trade scenario that has Toronto Maple Leafs fans debating the future of their blue line. On the ""Leafs Morning Take"" podcast, Rosehill weighed in on a hypothetical deal that would send Morgan Rielly and Nick Robertson to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for Erik Karlsson , who is on an eight-year, $92 million contract.While acknowledging the unlikeliness of such a move, Jay Rosehill made it clear he’d pull the trigger in a heartbeat. “I take that all day,” Rosehill said. “We're gonna try and get rid of Nick Robertson in general… I just don't think he's gonna be here. And Morgan Rielly is, you know, kind of stalled, makes 7.5 million. Doesn't produce like he used to. Sometimes has some dead stuff going on in the D-zone.”Rosehill praised Karlsson’s resume, pointing to his Norris Trophy-winning pedigree, elite puck movement, and power play ability. Still, he admitted the blockbuster was more of a dream scenario than a realistic front-office move. “I just don't see anyone going for that… so I would take it for sure. But I just don't see it happening.”The mock deal quickly lit up fan discussions online. Some fans argued that Karlsson isn’t worth the package, while others said it would be a “Christmas present” for Toronto. One fan countered bluntly: “Pretty sure Rielly says no.”Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Edmonton Oilers weighing major trade with Bruins as Connor McDavid contract factor looms With Toronto’s offseason decisions still under scrutiny, Rosehill’s take reflects a broader debate: should the Leafs gamble on another star defenseman or continue betting on their current core?",Former NHL enforcer Jay Rosehill stirred the pot with a bold trade scenario that has Toronto Maple Leafs fans debating the future of their blue line.

“I literally tried everything. Running, walking, biking, stair-climber, you name it, I did it … Even now trying to play a professional sport, … I felt like, ‘OK, I don’t want to do this because it is a shortcut…’ But it actually isn’t.”

Poll Do you think RCB made the right decision by letting Mohammed Siraj go? Yes, it was the right call. No, they should have retained him.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) finally ended their 18-year wait for an Indian Premier League (IPL) title in 2025. The breakthrough came in the very first season of the new three-year cycle after the mega auction. RCB built a fresh core with major signings like Josh Hazlewood Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Phil Salt, while parting ways with big names such as Glenn Maxwell and Mohammed Siraj Speaking to Cricbuzz, RCB’s director of cricket Mo Bobat revealed the thinking behind letting Siraj go. “Siraj is probably the player that we spent the longest deliberating over,” he admitted.The fast bowler had been part of RCB for seven years, taking 99 wickets in 102 matches. But the management decided not to retain him before the 2025 auction. “Indian international bowlers are not that easy to get. We discussed every eventuality with Siraj, whether to retain him, release him, or use the Right to Match. It was not a straightforward call,” Bobat explained.Eventually, RCB secured Hazlewood for Rs 12.50 crore and Bhuvneshwar for Rs 10.75 crore, while Siraj went to Gujarat Titans for Rs 12.25 crore. Bobat admitted that Bhuvneshwar’s ability to bowl both with the new ball and at the death tilted the decision. “We were keen to try and get Bhuvi for two ends of the innings. Keeping Siraj would have made that difficult. There is never just one reason, several factors come into play,” he said.Siraj had a steady season with 16 wickets in 15 matches for Gujarat, while Bhuvneshwar struck 17 times and played a crucial role in RCB’s title run. Hazlewood stood out as the tournament’s leading bowler with 22 wickets in 12 matches at an economy of under nine.Bobat also revealed that Australian all-rounder Cameron Green was not retained only because of injury. “Had he been fit, we would almost certainly have retained him,” he confirmed.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) ended their 18-year wait for an Indian Premier League (IPL) title in 2025.

Stephen A. Smith has broken his silence on where things stand with Shannon Sharpe following his firing from ESPN earlier this summer. Speaking on The Dan Le Batard Show, Smith stressed that his relationship with Sharpe remains strong, even if network executives decided otherwise.Stephen A. Smith reaffirmed his bond with Shannon Sharpe despite ESPN’s firing and a sexual assault case, praising Sharpe’s First Take impact while ESPN refreshes its lineup ahead of fall.“My relationship with Shannon Sharpe is a pretty damn good one. I got a lot of love for him,” Smith said. “He did a great, great job for First Take. Anything that I needed him to do, he has always been there for me. It’s unfortunate what happened with his situation. And certain decisions that were made were way above my pay grade.”Sharpe’s ESPN departure came after he was named in an April sexual assault lawsuit filed by a woman with whom he had been involved. The suit caught ESPN by surprise—Sharpe still appeared on First Take that same day—but the fallout escalated quickly. He soon announced a leave of absence, and by July, ESPN formalized his exit. The lawsuit was ultimately settled with a payout, but the reputational damage has lingered.The case has left Sharpe’s future uncertain. Despite boasting over 1.8 million subscribers on YouTube, he has not landed another major television role or a high-profile podcast deal. His digital presence continues to grow, but the absence of a mainstream media platform underscores the impact of the allegations.ESPN, meanwhile, is pivoting. The network has added former NFL quarterback Chase Daniel as a commentator and signed college football analyst Josh Pate, moves designed to strengthen its coverage ahead of the 2025 season.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen sparks buzz as Tom Brady’s son bonds with her new baby daddy Joaquim Valente For Smith, the message is one of loyalty.

Legal Turning Point as Malik Beasley Officially Cleared from Gambling Probe

How Beasley’s Clearance Could Impact the NBA Free Agency Landscape

A Clearer Future for Malik Beasley After Months of Uncertainty

, one of the NBA’s elite sharpshooters and a key figure in this year’s free agency, has received major relief in his ongoing legal saga. According to attorneys Steve Haney and Mike Schachter, Beasley is no longer a target in the federal gambling investigation conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York. The update, first reported by Shams Charania via ESPN, could reshape Beasley’s career trajectory and reignite stalled contract negotiations.The federal probe, launched more than a year ago, focused on suspicious betting patterns connected to Malik Beasley’s performances during the 2023-24 NBA season with the Milwaukee Bucks. At the heart of the inquiry were “prop bets” - wagers tied to player-specific statistics like points, rebounds, or assists.In January 2024, a major U.S. sportsbook flagged irregular betting activity on Beasley’s stat lines, alerting federal authorities and leading to the involvement of the Eastern District of New York. As a result, Beasley’s anticipated free agency deal was put on hold, despite him being in prime position to sign a three-year, $42 million contract with the Detroit Pistons.Beasley’s career-best season, highlighted by 16.3 points per game and a Milwaukee franchise record 319 three-pointers, was overshadowed by the investigation.The uncertainty around his future left teams cautious and unwilling to commit financially.The gambling inquiry was not Beasley’s only off-court challenge. His former agency, Hazan Sports, filed a $2.25 million lawsuit against him, alleging breach of contract and failure to repay a $650,000 advance tied to marketing revenues.This combination of federal scrutiny and legal disputes created significant barriers for Beasley’s free agency, leaving one of the league’s most consistent shooters in limbo.Malik Beasley’s attorneys have now confirmed he is no longer considered a target in the federal gambling case. Attorney Steve Haney emphasized the distinction, stating: “An investigation is not a charge.” This clarification provides both legal and public reassurance that Beasley’s name has been cleared from the most serious allegations.The decision not only lifts a cloud over his reputation but also removes a critical obstacle preventing NBA teams from pursuing him aggressively in free agency.Known for his three-point consistency and durability—playing all 82 games last season—Beasley’s market value remains high. Analysts consistently rank him among the best remaining free agents of the 2025 offseason, with teams in need of outside shooting expected to reenter discussions now that his legal risks have eased.His ability to stretch defenses with elite shooting makes him a plug-and-play option for any roster. The removal of the federal probe could accelerate renewed negotiations and allow him to finally secure the long-term contract that was previously derailed.At the league level, Beasley’s case highlights the NBA’s evolving relationship with legalized sports betting. The league continues to balance its partnership with betting operators while enforcing strict rules on player involvement, a tension further underscored by recent cases like Jontay Porter’s federal wire fraud charges.For Malik Beasley, this development marks a critical step toward stability. While the lawsuit with his former agency still lingers, the resolution of the federal investigation removes the most damaging threat to his career.Fans, teams, and analysts will now shift their focus back to his basketball talent, particularly his unmatched perimeter shooting. As free agency progresses, Beasley appears poised to land the kind of deal that matches his on-court production.Also read: Jayson Tatum Injury Update: Boston Superstar Calls Rehab ‘Tedious’ Months After Achilles Injury Shakes Celtics’ Season His journey over the past year illustrates the high stakes of life as an NBA player, where career-defining opportunities can be stalled by off-court issues.

August 22 also marks the day that the Vikings reportedly expressed interest in reacquiring their former wideout from the Carolina Panthers. According to NFL Insider Adam Schefter on X(formerly Twitter), the Vikings inquired about a trade for Panthers WR Adam Thielen(as per league sources).

Thielen actually grew up in Detroit Lakes MN and went to D2 Minnesota Mankato. He has ties to the region.”A fan jotted down all the reasons why Thielen was perfect for the Vikings: “Thielen might not be in his prime, but his experience, leadership, reliable hands, route-running skills, familiarity with the system, and red-zone effectiveness would all be valuable assets for the Vikings, especially considering their current needs at the receiver position.” A fan spoke for the wideout, “I hope Adam Thielen enjoys wherever he plays. ”When all the fans seemed excited for Adam Thielen’s return to his parent team, one fan questioned the reason behind the Panthers’ trade: “Why would the Panthers do that when they’re trying to be a half decent team this year?” Another fan predicted Thielen’s retirement, “He’s gonna retire this year. bookmark it Adam.” A third fan pointed out, “He deserves to not have to finish his career on a 5 win team.” The Carolina Panthers had finished the 2024 season with a 5-12 record.",Adam Thielen played nine seasons for the Minnesota Vikings.

Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson is dealing with a foot injury that has raised questions about his readiness for the 2025 NFL season. Jackson was injured during a practice session when his foot was stepped on, forcing him to leave early. While the team has insisted the injury isn’t serious, top NFL reporter Adam Schefter expressed doubts about the official updates, suggesting the situation might be more “scarier” than the Ravens are saying.On ‘NFL on ESPN’ Thursday, Adam Schefter shared his thoughts on the injury, pointing out some inconsistencies in the Ravens’ messaging. Although the team reported no broken bones after X-rays and coach John Harbaugh called it a “big relief,” Schefter noted that Jackson has missed two straight days of practice. ""It sounds like it's a little bit scarier than the Ravens led on,"" Schefter said. ""Because they did take X-rays, they did say there were no signs of broken bones or any issues, and John Harbaugh admitted his prayers were answered. So, if there were anything that was nothing, he wouldn't have to pray that Lamar Jackson's X-rays would have turned out the way they did.""Schefter added that the team likely will give Jackson’s foot some extra time to heal since they need him ready for the regular season.The fact that Jackson hasn’t practiced yet this week raises questions about how soon he’ll be back on the field.Coach John Harbaugh later gave an update, confirming the foot injury and saying the quick X-rays showed no damage. Harbaugh admitted Jackson is still sore but is expected to recover soon. ""He got his foot stepped on like we said yesterday. They did a quick X-ray and there's no damage or anything like that. I'm sure it's a little sore today, so we just kept him in. But he's fine. He's going to be good."" Harbaugh said, adding, ""It was a big relief. I told the guys, I said, 'prayers get answered.' Because I was praying. God came through. But he's good.""Jackson himself reacted to the injury talk by commenting with a laughing emoji on Schefter’s viral video.The Ravens will take on the Washington Commanders in their last preseason game on Saturday as they get ready for the regular season.

Mike Vrabel calls out ‘rats’ inside Patriots for leaking injury news

Mike Vrabel didn’t waste any time making his presence felt in New England. Just a few weeks into his new job as Patriots head coach, Vrabel fired off one of the spiciest soundbites of the NFL preseason, calling out the “rats” inside his building. Yes, you read that right. Mike Vrabel says someone is leaking injury updates to reporters, and he’s ready to hunt them down.During a press conference, Mike Vrabel didn’t sugarcoat his frustration when asked about leaks surrounding player injuries. His words? Straight out of a mob flick:It wasn’t just a slip, it was a warning. Mike Vrabel is setting the tone that loyalty first, leaks last. For a team trying to rebuild its identity, that message hits loud and clear.If you’ve followed the Patriots, this shouldn’t shock you.

Florida Panthers bring in Luke Kunin on one-year contract for 2025-26 season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/florida-panthers-bring-in-luke-kunin-on-one-year-contract-for-2025-26-season/articleshow/123462246.cms,"Godofredo A. Vasquez/AP

Florida Panthers add forward Luke Kunin as depth option for 2025-26 NHL season

Luke Kunin faces competition for roster spot on Florida Panthers

The Florida Panthers have signed forward Luke Kunin to a one-year, league-minimum contract, marking the veteran’s fifth NHL stop. Kunin, originally drafted 15th overall by the Minnesota Wild in 2016, has carved out a career as a versatile forward capable of filling multiple roles. After stints with the Wild, Predators, Sharks, and Blue Jackets, he now looks to earn a spot on Florida’s roster heading into the 2025-26 season.Kunin, 27, joins the Florida Panthers with several years of NHL experience across multiple teams. He broke into the league with Minnesota in 2017-18 and showed early promise, producing a 23-29–52 line in his first three seasons with the Wild. Traded to Nashville in 2020, he initially provided secondary scoring before injuries and reduced minutes slowed his momentum.Later stints with the San Jose Sharks and Columbus Blue Jackets saw Kunin transition more into a checking role. An ACL injury during his time in San Jose cut short one season, and his offensive numbers dipped after returning. Over the past two years, Kunin posted back-to-back 18-point campaigns, though his defensive metrics suffered on struggling teams. His experience, versatility, and ability to kill penalties, however, give him value as a depth signing for Florida.While the Panthers secured Kunin on a one-way deal, his spot in the opening night lineup is not guaranteed. He will face stiff competition from depth forwards such as Jonah Gadjovich, A.J. Greer, and Tomas Nosek, all of whom contributed to Florida’s Stanley Cup-winning run. Kunin’s ability to adapt between center and wing could prove crucial in his push to crack the roster.For Florida, the move represents a low-risk signing aimed at bolstering forward depth. The Panthers remain one of the NHL’s strongest contenders after their championship campaign, and competition for roster spots is expected to be fierce. Kunin’s NHL experience and willingness to embrace a checking role may give him an edge as training camp unfolds.The signing of Luke Kunin reflects Florida’s strategy of reinforcing depth while maintaining roster flexibility. For Kunin, it represents another opportunity to re-establish himself in the NHL after bouncing between teams in recent seasons. If he can rediscover his early form and carve out a reliable role, he could become a valuable asset to the Panthers in their pursuit of back-to-back success.Also Read: NHL Trade News: Minnesota Wild secure Marco Rossi with 3-year, $15 million deal","Florida Panthers add forward Luke Kunin as depth option for 2025-26 NHL season.

LeBron James reacts to public statements involving family

Tensions between ESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith and Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James have reached a boiling point during the 2024/25 NBA season. What began as normal basketball talk has grown into something more serious, with both men openly addressing the issue on national shows. The clash has now drawn attention far beyond the court, raising questions about respect, boundaries, and whether their relationship can ever be repaired.During a Lakers home game in Los Angeles in December 2024, the event became personal, to Stephen A. Smith. LeBron James walked up to him courtside in the third quarter and charged him with attacking his son, Bronny James, Smith said during an interview on The Dan Le Batard Show on February 18, 2025.""And to me, what he did when he confronted me in the third quarter in the middle of the game court side,"" Smith said. ""Blaming me for something I did not do… and then trying to turn it into me being somebody who would go after somebody's family. That’s a line you don’t get to come back from.""Smith remarked that his remarks on Bronny were only about basketball performance, not family. He also highlighted that he had previously publicly complimented LeBron's wife, Savannah James, labeling her the ""First Lady of the NBA"" and said LeBron's mother, Gloria James, was ""a marvelous woman.""The ESPN anchor clarified that LeBron crossed a line in his estimation when he made the issue personal. Smith kept saying the damage was irreversible.LeBron James spoke about the incident weeks later on The Pat McAfee Show in January 2025. He said his main issue was not about basketball criticism, but about how Smith’s comments felt too personal when they involved his 20-year-old son, Bronny James.""He completely missed the whole point,"" LeBron said during the January 10, show. ""Never would I ever not allow people to talk about the sport and criticize players about what they do. But when you take it and you get personal with it, it’s my job to protect my household and also protect players.""Bronny James, who is in his rookie season with the Lakers, had been under close media attention throughout 2024 and 2025. After he scored 17 points and added five assists against the Milwaukee Bucks on January 4, 2025, Smith even admitted on ESPN’s First Take that he “might have been wrong” in doubting him early.Still, the public back-and-forth has left both men standing firm. Smith, says there is no path to reconciliation, while LeBron, the NBA’s all-time scoring leader at 40, continues to defend his family strongly.","ESPN analyst Stephen A.

Eric Dickerson says NFL wanted to “make an example” out of Sanders



“I tell you this much, what I heard from someone that's in the NFL — the NFL told [teams] don’t draft him, do not draft him,”

“We’re going to make an example out of him.”

Eric Dickerson EXPOSES NFL's Shedeur Sanders Collusion Plan from INSIDE SOURCE!

Pre-draft concerns about Sanders’ attitude played into his slide



Not everyone is buying the conspiracy theory



“I don’t think there was any conspiracy here,”

“The great majority of NFL teams did not view him as a first-round prospect contrary to what had been out there.”

“there’s entertainers and there’s competitors,”

When Shedeur Sanders slipped all the way to the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, most people chalked it up to bad evaluations, attitude concerns, or maybe just bad luck. But Hall of Famer Eric Dickerson is now tossing out a theory that has Browns fans and NFL Twitter buzzing. According to him, the league didn’t just let Sanders slide, they made it happen on purpose.In his recent interview, Dickerson claimed he was told by a highly connected source that the NFL gave teams a direct message: don’t draft Shedeur Sanders.Dickerson said.Dickerson even went further, suggesting the Browns only ended up taking him at No. 144 because someone behind the scenes pushed them to. The idea? To prove to players what happens if you bring too much noise into the league.Before this conspiracy theory, the more common explanation was that Sanders simply rubbed some teams the wrong way. Reports surfaced during the draft process that some execs saw him as arrogant in interviews, more invested in off-field projects than playbooks, and maybe too comfortable leaning on the “Coach Prime” brand.Add in the fact that Deion Sanders was openly warning franchises about where he wanted his son to play, and suddenly the “can’t-miss” first-rounder started to look risky. That combination of family politics and personality red flags may have been enough to scare teams off, regardless of talent.While Dickerson’s claim made waves, insiders like NFL reporter Albert Breer aren’t convinced. He argued that the league had no secret directive, teams just didn’t see Sanders as a true first-round prospect.Breer said.And historically, Breer has a point, once quarterbacks slide past Round 1, they often freefall until the mid-rounds. Sanders may have been just the latest to fit that pattern.Regardless of how he got to Cleveland, Sanders isn’t walking into an easy situation. The Browns named Joe Flacco their Week 1 starter, while Sanders is battling it out with rookie Dillon Gabriel, Kenny Pickett, and Ty Huntley for backup reps.Things got spicier when Gabriel commented,which many took as shade at Sanders. Instead of firing back, Sanders brushed it off with a calm answer about leaning on his faith and not letting words get to him. Later, he revealed Gabriel told him directly the remark wasn’t meant for him anyway.Also read - “It’s not going to change my life”: Shedeur Sanders reacts to Dillon Gabriel’s viral quote that fans thought was shade",Shedeur Sanders slipped all the way to the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft.

NEW DELHI: India spinner Yuzvendra Chahal and choreographer-actor Dhanashree Verma’s separation has remained in the public spotlight months after their divorce was finalised. While both have opened up about their journey in parts — first Chahal in a podcast and later Dhanashree in her own candid conversation — the latest development has seen an unexpected voice of support emerging from within Indian cricket circles. Suryakumar Yadav ’s wife, Devisha Shetty, publicly extended her solidarity with Dhanashree after the latter shared her experiences on the podcast ‘Humans of Bombay’. In an Instagram story that soon gained traction on social media, Devisha posted a picture of Dhanashree from the interview, captioning it: “So much respect and love for you.”The message struck a chord, with many praising Devisha for standing by her friend. Both women were often spotted together at matches during Chahal’s time in the Indian side and Suryakumar’s ongoing stint with the T20I team.Dhanashree, who finalised her divorce in March, had described the moment of separation as overwhelming. “I genuinely feel that the day it actually happened, it was very emotional for me and my family. I still remember when I was standing there and the verdict was about to be given… I literally started howling and crying in front of everybody,” she recalled on the podcast.She also revealed how the aftermath unfolded in front of the media glare.“He walked out first, that whole thing happened with the T-shirt and media, and I wasn’t aware about it because I was still inside. I got out from the back gate… I sat in the car, my best friend was there with me, and we were still trying to grasp our breath.

Former world chess champion Garry Kasparov has shared his views on the current state of world chess championship during the Sinquefield Cup tournament's fifth round broadcast. On Friday, he specifically commented on Gukesh's recent world championship title.Following Magnus Carlsen 's departure from the world championship cycle in 2023, Ding Liren of China and Gukesh Dommaraju of India became the 17th and 18th world champions, respectively.Gukesh made history by becoming the youngest world champion at age 18 when he defeated Ding in Singapore last year.When discussing Gukesh's achievement as a teenage world champion, Kasparov said, ""Gukesh won fair and square but you can hardly call him the strongest player in the world. I don't want to sound offensive, but I think Magnus ended the era of classical world champions. Gukesh's world championship title is very different. It's still clear that Magnus is the strongest and Gukesh is yet to prove his superiority over others. Even players of his age category. The round 1 game against Praggnanandhaa at the Sinquefield Cup was very unimpressive. The rules are the rules and the games are the games.""Kasparov later offered an apology while maintaining his stance.""I'm sure there will be more excitement in the Candidates and the next world championship match. But I apologise. I have to apologise time and again. This is not exactly the title that I had or Karpov had or Fischer had or Magnus had.""These remarks came as Gukesh played to a draw against Polish grandmaster Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who had previously assisted him in becoming world champion.Kasparov's perspective carries significant weight as he won the world championship title six times, including four victories against Anatoly Karpov, and wins over Nigel Short and Viswanathan Anand.Alongside Bobby Fischer and Magnus Carlsen, Kasparov is often considered one of the greatest chess players in history. He briefly served as Carlsen's coach during the latter's early career.Carlsen has frequently acknowledged Kasparov as the greatest chess player in the sport's history.","Gukesh Dommaraju became the youngest world champion at age 18 last year.

Team India batter Rohit Sharma may be one of the biggest names in world cricket, but he never forgets the fans who cheer for him every step of the way.The India skipper was recently spotted stuck in Mumbai’s notorious evening traffic in his brand-new Lamborghini. Even while waiting at a signal, Rohit found time to acknowledge a supporter, smiling and raising his thumb through the window.The short clip, shared on social media, has quickly gone viral, with fans praising the cricketer’s humility despite the chaos of city roads.Watch:While Rohit’s warm gesture made waves online, conversations about his career trajectory and future in international cricket also surfaced this week.BCCI vice president Rajeev Shukla addressed the growing chatter around potential farewell matches for both Rohit and Virat Kohli, following their retirement from two formats.“They haven’t retired, have they?” Shukla said. “Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are both playing One-Dayers. They haven’t taken retirement, so why are you worrying about their farewell? Retirement from two formats, that’s a phase, but they are still playing ODIs.Don’t worry this much. BCCI policy is quite clear; we won’t ask anyone to retire. That decision rests with the players themselves, and we respect that.”The speculation about grand send-offs stems from memories of Sachin Tendulkar’s farewell at Wankhede Stadium in 2013. However, Shukla insisted it was premature. “Virat Kohli is very fit, and Rohit Sharma plays very well. Why are you worried about their farewell?” he added.Both stars bowed out of T20Is after lifting the 2024 World Cup in the West Indies, and soon after, retired from Test cricket in May 2025.

Kobe Bryant’s 1996 NBA Draft story inspires Warner Bros. feature film titled ‘With the 8th Pick’



Kobe Bryant left an astonishing legacy in the NBA



Warner Bros. Pictures is moving forward with a new feature film centered on one of the most iconic moments in NBA history, Kobe Bryant ’s entry into the league. The studio has acquired the spec script With the 8th Pick, which will dramatize the behind-the-scenes maneuvering surrounding the 1996 NBA Draft. The project, written by Alex Sohn and Gavin Johannsen, promises to explore the tense negotiations, personal stakes, and decisions that nearly changed Bryant’s career before it ever began.Though the title references the eighth pick, Kobe Bryant was actually selected thirteenth overall by the Charlotte Hornets. He was immediately traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for veteran center Vlade Divac. The New Jersey Nets, who held the eighth pick, were on the verge of drafting the 17-year-old prodigy but ultimately passed after head coach John Calipari overruled general manager John Nash. That decision, as basketball history shows, shifted the trajectory of both Bryant’s life and the Lakers franchise.According to industry reports, the film is designed as a draft-day thriller, unfolding in the two weeks leading up to the 1996 draft.Producers Tim and Trevor White, best known for King Richard, are attached to the project alongside Religion of Sports’ Ryan Stowell and Gotham Chopra, who previously directed the 2015 documentary Kobe Bryant’s Muse.Warner Bros. has yet to announce a director or cast, and the project is currently in early development.While With the 8th Pick isn’t a conventional biopic, the choice to frame Kobe Bryant’s draft story reflects the weight of his legacy. Over two decades with the Lakers, Bryant became a five-time NBA champion, league MVP, and 18-time All-Star. His astounding legacy secured his place among the greatest players in basketball history.Beyond basketball, factors like his Adidas sneaker deal, worth significantly more in Los Angeles than New Jersey, played into the decision-making process. Insiders note that financial struggles within the Nets organization further limited their ability to take the risk on a young guard straight out of high school.Also Read: Ex NBA All-Star Shawn Kemp sentenced to 30 days of confinement in gun-related case The film’s development also arrives with a bittersweet note. Bryant, his daughter Gianna, and seven others tragically died in a 2020 helicopter crash. The project reportedly avoids revisiting that tragedy, instead focusing on a story that highlights the beginning of his journey.","Warner Bros.

Why does a LeBron James trade to the Golden State Warriors remain a long shot despite interest?

According to reports, the Golden State Warriors have contacted the Los Angeles Lakers several times in the last few months to discuss potential trade options for LeBron James . The talk for the potential trade, that would link LeBron with two-time MVP Stephen Curry, has been ongoing for the past 18 months. It validates what many have suspected, that the G.S. Warriors have long been interested in bringing together two generational superstars, even though nothing has been concluded yet.It has emerged that LeBron James has been under close observation by the Golden State Warriors. In February 2024, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski and Ramona Shelburne broke news that the team had called the L.A. Lakers about trading the legend. However, Rich Paul , LeBron James' agent, informed Golden State that he had no interest in being transferred.On the other hand, NBA insider Jake Fischer claimed that for the previous 18 months, the Golden State Warriors had contacted the Los Angeles Lakers to discuss trade options that might match LeBron with two-time MVP Stephen Curry He further wrote:“I’m told that the Warriors have called the Lakers on multiple occasions over the past 18 months to see whether there is any trade pathway to pairing [LeBron] James with Stephen Curry, who roughly a year ago at this time was teaming with LeBron for the United States senior men’s national team on its run to a gold medal at the Paris Olympics.""Despite their longstanding rivalry on the field, which dates back to four consecutive NBA Finals between LeBron James' Cleveland Cavaliers and Stephen Curry's Golden State Warriors from 2015 to 2018, the icons recently got the opportunity to work together for the first time.What the G.S. Warriors were offering the L.A. Lakers is unknown, but it was obviously insufficient to initiate a transfer.NBA insider Jake Fischer reported that the Golden State Warriors are still considering matching up LeBron James with long-time standout Stephen Curry. LeBron James still has a contract with the L.A. Lakers despite Golden State's constant calls.Being one of the most powerful people in the NBA guarantees that any conversation about his future is directly related to his openness to talks. He has indicated no desire to leave Los Angeles up to now, nor have his agents.Meanwhile, Golden State's ongoing bids to maximize its championship window with Stephen Curry are evidenced by their pursuit of LeBron James. As the NBA's new season draws closer, the Los Angeles Lakers ' decision to keep the legend and team him up with Luka Doncic signals their own attempt to win another championship.Also read: Luka Doncic wants LeBron James to finish his career with Los Angeles Lakers despite growing tensions","Golden State Warriors expressed interest in pairing LeBron James with Stephen Curry in trade talks with Los Angeles Lakers.

Why Ciara believes the criticism says more about others than Russell Wilson

When it comes to love, Ciara has no time for outside noise. The Grammy-winning singer recently opened up about her husband Russell Wilson being labeled “corny,” and she made it clear she isn’t interested in entertaining that narrative.During an appearance on The Breakfast Club on August 22, Ciara was asked how she feels about people calling the Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback “corny.” Her answer was short but powerful.“I don't even have to reply to that,” she said. “Why would I even respond to that, you know what I'm saying? I know what I know, and that's all that matters.”The “Level Up” singer went on to praise Wilson, calling him “the most amazing human being you can know” and “the smartest, most intelligent Black man that I have ever known.” She emphasized that the man people see publicly is exactly who he is in private—genuine, grounded, and loving.Charlamagne tha God noted that some critics label Wilson as a “simp.” Ciara fired back, questioning the perspective of those who use such terms. “Well, I think it depends on…well, who's the man saying it? … Have you ever loved someone right? Have you ever been loved right?” she asked.Rather than being upset, Ciara chooses compassion. “Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but we don't have to live, I don't have to live my life to prove anything to anybody,” she said.Also Read: “Give up my dream because…”: Gisele Bündchen slams the media and reveals the truth behind split with Tom Brady Married since 2016, Ciara and Wilson continue to show the world that their love story is built on respect, faith, and authenticity—qualities that transcend labels like “corny.”","Ciara was asked how she feels about people calling the Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback “corny.” “I think it depends on…well, who's the man saying it? … Have you ever loved someone right? have you ever been loved right?” she asked.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123463507,imgsize-30086,width-400,resizemode-4/123463507.jpg"

Travis Hunter’s blunt public defense — and the quote that became a meme

Media, social media and the rise of instant judgment

What athletes can learn — from PR to mental resilience

When Travis Hunter burst onto the national stage as the Colorado Buffaloes’ two-way phenom and a Heisman winner, the spotlight didn’t stop at his stats. It followed his personal life — and in December 2024 that attention landed on his wife, Leanna Lenee, after a tense moment during Hunter’s Adidas appearance in New York. What might have been a private reaction turned into a public backlash, prompting Hunter to push back hard.On a livestream, Travis Hunter answered his critics with a line that lit up social feeds: “She brings value to me,"" Hunter declared. ""She makes me money and she makes her own money. So, if you're going to say she's a gold digger, make sure you say I'm a gold digger, too.”The remark did more than defend Lenee; it reframed the conversation about value and partnership. Hunter emphasized that Lenee “brings value to me” and is financially independent, undercutting the simplistic label critics wanted to pin on her.The controversy highlights a broader trend: athletes’ private lives are now public entertainment. NFL Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe weighed in on Nightcap, warning that oversharing invites scrutiny. “If you don’t put your relationship online, you don’t have to worry about opinions,” he said, adding, ""Why share that? It paints a picture nobody needed to see."" Sharpe’s remarks point to a practical playbook for young stars navigating fame: control the narrative or risk having one imposed on you.Beyond the headlines, the episode is a case study in reputation management and mental health for emerging stars. Keeping relationship details private, setting ground rules with partners about public appearances, and leaning on trusted advisors can reduce needless controversy. Hunter’s public stance also sent a message about loyalty and agency: instead of letting rumors define Lenee, he chose to defend her value openly.Also Read: Travis Hunter’s wife Leanna Lenee recalled why she once ignored him, saying he wasn’t really 'her type’ As the Buffaloes prepared for the Alamo Bowl later that month, Hunter’s focus remained on football — but the episode left a clear takeaway: in today’s sports culture, winning on the field and protecting your life off it are equally important.","Colorado Buffaloes star Travis Hunter defended his wife Leanna Lenee after she faced public criticism.

Andrea Petkovic, a former professional tennis player from Germany, said today she is upset with the way the media talked about Carlos Alcaraz arriving in New York.

Andrea Petkovic called those stories “out of control”, saying they are not true and unfair.Andrea Petkovic said one headline read,She thought that was very wrong and too dramatic.

Away from the field, his fiancée Zo Caswell has grabbed attention by revealing she has begun her wedding dress hunt ahead of their big day.The Browns’ quarterback room is one of the most-watched battles this preseason.

With Flacco’s age a factor and Sanders still adjusting to the pro level, Gabriel’s ability to step up could prove decisive as the season unfolds.

“Start. I’m going to just play it by ear. They’ll start it off. We’ll just see how it goes from there.”

Kansas City Chiefs HC Andy Reid Talks After Wednesday Practice

Patrick Mahomes has barely played in the preseason so far



Kansas City fans have been waiting all preseason to see Patrick Mahomes back in action, and Friday night at Arrowhead Stadium they’ll finally get their wish. After sitting out last week’s matchup in Seattle, head coach Andy Reid confirmed his starters including Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce , and Chris Jones will take the field against the Chicago Bears in the Chiefs’ preseason finale. The catch? Don’t expect them to stick around for long.Reid kept things simple when asked about his quarterback’s status:Translation: Patrick Mahomes will be out there with the first unit, but his playing time will depend on how quickly the team settles in.It’s a classic Andy Reid move, giving the top guys a chance to knock off some rust, but not risk unnecessary injuries with the regular season less than two weeks away.Through two games, Patrick Mahomes has only thrown one pass back in Week 1 against the Arizona Cardinals. Sitting him, along with Travis Kelce and Chris Jones, in the second preseason game left fans antsy, but the long-term plan has always been about keeping the stars fresh for when it matters.Friday night’s appearance will likely be short and sweet, but even a handful of snaps gives Patrick Mahomes a chance to sharpen his timing with receivers and test the offensive line against live competition.The Chiefs aren’t trying to win preseason trophies, they’re trying to defend their championship window. That means careful management of their biggest names. Andy Reid’s strategy of mixing rest with targeted live reps ensures that players like Mahomes, Kelce, and Jones enter Week 1 healthy while still carrying some real-game rhythm.Fans shouldn’t expect a four-quarter performance, this is more like a warm-up. But even a brief glimpse of the two-time MVP should be enough to light up Arrowhead one last time before the season kicks off.The Bears game isn’t about the score, it’s about preparation. Coaches will evaluate depth, tweak rotations, and watch how the offense and defense settle in with the starters leading the way.For Mahomes, it’s one final chance to lock in before the Week 1 opener. And for the fans, it’s a short but sweet preview of the firepower that will carry Kansas City into another season chasing the Lombardi.Also read - Eric Dickerson claims NFL told teams not to draft Shedeur Sanders, fueling conspiracy around Browns rookie",Andy Reid confirms Patrick Mahomes and starters will open the game against Chicago.

Also read:

Josh Allen is catching the spotlight for all the right reasons. The Buffalo Bills are prepping hard to start the regular season on a high note, and their key quarterback is busy being kinder to the world day by day. Yes, you heard it right. The 29-year-old quarterback is connecting with the fans, especially the tiny ones, during a relaxed pre-season, and linebacker Dion Dawkins is having his back.During the preseason matchup against the Chicago Bears, Allen didn’t log any snaps on the field. But what he did instead was pure classic. He took the ball and tossed it back to a young fan standing on the sideline. The boy took a few seconds to process what had just happened to him and beamed with instant joy. The crowd witnessing the moment was left stunned.Just a few days have passed, and the Bills' frontliner again came up with another heartwarming gesture to a kid, but this time with a little push from linebacker Dion Dawkins. As HBO’s Hard Knocks spilled some raw moments in the field, a kid was seen approaching Dawkins to help him meet Allen. Dawkins took him to Allen without giving it a second thought and let him pass on a gift to the QB.A dream come true moment for the kid who not only got to meet his idol but also received a high five and a special signed jersey from the 2024 NFL MVP.It looks like Allen knows his on-field duty just as good (if not better) than the off-field ones.Following a tumultuous rookie season, the 6 ft 5 led the Bills to a 10-6 record in his second year, a significant jump from his debut. However, the real career break came in year 3 when Allen completed 69.2% of his passes, throwing 37 touchdowns to 10 interceptions. There was no looking back since then.2022 and 2023 went decent. In 2024, Allen finally clinched the most prestigious MVP award. While he broke his streak of four consecutive seasons of over 4,000 yards, throwing 3,731 yards, Allen threw 28 touchdowns to just six interceptions. It’s definitely not it for Allen since he aims higher. But it seems he finds his footing pretty strong before the 2025 kicks off.

Minnesota Wild commit to Marco Rossi with 3-year, $15 million NHL contract

Impact of Marco Rossi’s contract on Minnesota Wild’s NHL roster decisions and future

The Minnesota Wild have re-signed restricted free agent center Marco Rossi to a three-year, $15 million contract, ending months of speculation about his future with the franchise. The deal carries a $5 million annual cap hit and comes after Rossi’s breakout season, where he established himself as one of Minnesota’s most important young forwards. The extension also provides the Wild stability as they navigate critical roster decisions moving forward.Rossi, 23, was coming off his entry-level contract and entered restricted free agency this summer amid trade rumors and questions about the Wild’s willingness to invest in him long term. Drafted ninth overall by Minnesota in 2020, Rossi posted career-best numbers last season with 24 goals and 36 assists for 60 points in 82 games. His production ranked second on the team in scoring behind Matt Boldy’s 73 points and placed him third in goals, trailing Boldy (27) and Kirill Kaprizov (25).Despite the uncertainty, Minnesota general manager Bill Guerin repeatedly emphasized Rossi’s importance to the club, stating he would match any potential offer sheet.Instead of extending negotiations into training camp, both sides agreed to a three-year bridge contract that balances Rossi’s rising value with the team’s cap flexibility.The signing puts an end to months of speculation that Rossi could be moved after his name surfaced in trade talks around last season’s deadline. By securing the young center, the Wild strengthened their top-six forward group while buying time to evaluate Rossi’s continued development before a longer-term deal.The timing of the extension is also significant for Minnesota’s broader roster outlook. By committing to Marco Rossi on a three-year, $15 million contract, the Wild ensured stability at center while maintaining salary cap flexibility. This move allows Rossi to continue developing into a consistent offensive presence as Minnesota looks to build on its 97-point season that ended in a first-round playoff loss to the Vegas Golden Knights.By securing Marco Rossi, the Wild have solidified their core and ended months of uncertainty about one of their brightest young players. The deal gives Rossi a chance to further prove himself while allowing Minnesota flexibility as they prepare for critical decisions on Kaprizov and the team’s long-term direction.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Seattle Kraken linked to trade talks for Minnesota Wild’s Marco Rossi","Minnesota Wild re-sign restricted free agent center Marco Rossi to three-year, $15 million contract.

Why Alex Forrest fits perfectly with Kitchener Rangers



Kitchener Rangers fans now have a new reason to look toward the future with hope. Alex Forrest was officially signed on an OHL Standard Player Agreement following his No. 24 draft choice in the 2025 OHL Priority Selection. The timing of this arrival could not be better, considering the organization was wrestling with the disappointment of Adam Valentini's decision to pursue his college career at the University of Michigan instead of Kitchener. However, Forrest is already heralded as one of Ontario's most thunderously exciting defensive prospects.At just 16 years old, Alex Forrest has made himself a player of incredible consistency and calm. From St. Catharines, Ontario, he played the 2024–25 season with Oakville Rangers U16 AAA. During that campaign, he was the best defenseman in the OMHA division, piling up 39 points in 34 games. His offensive instincts and defensive thinking made him the highest-scoring blueliner in the league, thus cementing his reputation as an all-around two-way defender.After U16, Forrest made the jump to the St. Catharines Falcons of the GOJHL, mixing it with some older opponents in the playoff format.Playing 13 games for the Falcons, he collected four points and showed that he can roll with the faster and more physical kind of hockey. The coaches spoke highly of his maturity, good puck movement, and confidence beyond his years.Kitchener Rangers GM Mike McKenzie had called Forrest an elite skater, highly competitive, and very much true to the way the team was going. Well known for his puck-carrying and deceptive edgework, Forrest excels in transition, creating offense at the blue line. His vision allows him to remain on the line, dash perfect passing lanes, or even get involved in offensive plays whenever the chance comes.The development of Alex Forrest has also attracted the national selectors, as Hockey Canada has invited him to their U17 Summer Development Camp, a setting often leading to international honours for budding stars.Also Read: Why the Chicago Blackhawks might end up regretting the Frank Nazar long-term extension By signing Alex Forrest, the Kitchener Rangers not only acquired a highly skilled defenseman but also a player with the potential to mature into a franchise cornerstone. His skating ability, composure, and offensive instincts will enable him to garner attention from the crowd and be instrumental to the Rangers' future.","Alex Forrest is a 16-year-old defenseman from Oakville, Ontario.
