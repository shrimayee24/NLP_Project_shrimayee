NEW DELHI: In a thrilling IPL 2024 match at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Bhuvneshwar Kumar's nerve-wracking performance secured a 1-run victory for Sunrisers Hyderabad against Rajasthan Royals. Despite facing adversity, SRH pulled off a remarkable comeback to clinch the win when defeat seemed imminent.Rajasthan holds 16 points from 10 matches, with 4 games remaining.Sunrisers Hyderabad's victory, by just one run against Rajasthan, has propelled them to the fourth spot, pushing Chennai Super Kings down to fifth place.In the 50th IPL 2024 clash, Sunrisers Hyderabad faced Rajasthan Royals. SRH struggled early on but Travis Head and Nitish Reddy's partnership of 96 off 57 balls revived their innings, with Heinrich Klaasen's unbeaten 42 providing the final push.Despite losing two wickets in the first over, Rajasthan's Riyan Parag (77) and opener Yashasvi Jaiswal (67) built a strong 133-run stand. Yet, Sunrisers' bowlers fought back fiercely, clinching a thrilling win on the last ball. Parag's impressive 77 propelled him to the fourth spot in the IPL 2024 Orange Cap list, tallying 409 runs.In the 50th IPL 2024 clash between SRH and RR, T Natarajan clinched two vital wickets, catapulting him to the top of the IPL 2024 Purple Cap race, overtaking MI's Jasprit Bumrah. Natarajan boasts 15 wickets in 8 matches, while Bumrah has 14 wickets in 10 matches. Meanwhile, Yuzvendra Chahal had a tough outing, failing to take any wickets and conceding 62 runs in his four overs.Following Natarajan and Bumrah are Mustafizur Rahman and Harshal Patel, both with 14 wickets each. Bumrah leads them in the Purple Cap race due to his superior economy and average. Matheesha Pathirana closely follows with 13 wickets in 6 matches, currently occupying the fifth position.",The IPL 2024 Orange cap is the most expensive cap in the world. The cap costs an estimated $1.5 million per cap. It is the first time the cap has been used in the Indian Premier League (IPL) since it was introduced in 1998.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109810997,imgsize-43626,width-400,resizemode-4/109810997.jpg"

He later dubbed his comment a ""little joke on Indian politics"" and hoped ""it does not pass for advocacy or expertise"".The remarks followed Rahul posting on his Insta handle on May 1 a video of himself playing chess. He described Kasparov as his favourite player, a ""non-linear thinker"" who ""puts a lot of psychological pressure on the opponent"". ""In chess as in politics, every move your opponent makes can be used to your advantage,"" wrote Rahul.This drew a searing post from an X user who tagged Rahul's video and wrote: ""Feel so relieved that Kasparov and Viswanathan Anand retired early and didn't have to face the greatest chess genius of our times."" Kasparov's ""Rae Bareli win"" remark followed this and went viral.On Saturday, Kasparov appeared to have second thoughts when he dubbed his comment a ""little joke."" ""But as an 'all-seeing monster with 1000 eyes', as I was once described, I cannot fail to see a politician dabbling in my beloved game,"" wrote Kasparov, who became the youngest world champion in 1985 at 22 after beating compatriot Anatoly Karpov. Now a political activist and a fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kasparov had a keen contest with Vishwanathan Anand for the world title.","Former world chess champion Garry Kasparov has waded into India's poll pyrotechnics with a comment aimed at Congress MP Rahul Gandhi.

NEW DELHI: In Chennai Super Kings' commanding 78-run victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad, Tushar Deshpande's sensational bowling performance during the powerplay proved to be the game-changer. Ruturaj Gaikwad, the skipper, recognized Deshpande's pivotal role in shifting the momentum back in their favour, a momentum that had been elusive throughout the season.Deshpande's wholehearted effort reflected in his figures of 4/27 off three overs. Particularly impactful were his three wickets during the powerplay, which dismantled the formidable Sunrisers Hyderabad batting order, led by Travis Head.In terms of individual performances for IPL 2024 Purple Cap list, Mustafizur Rahman's exceptional bowling performance saw him claim two wickets, elevating him to the second position in the IPL Purple Cap List. Rahman now has 14 wickets in 8 innings, tying with Purple Cap leader Jasprit Bumrah of Mumbai Indians, who has taken 14 wickets in 9 innings. However, Bumrah retains the top spot due to his superior economy and average.Also See:Harshal Patel of Punjab Kings follows closely behind in third place in the Purple Cap race, also with 14 wickets in 9 innings, but his economy and average are not as impressive as Bumrah and Rahman's. Matheesha Pathirana of CSK also had a noteworthy performance in the match, claiming two wickets, bringing his total to 13 wickets in 6 innings, securing him the fourth spot on the purple cap list. T Natarajan is in fifth place, having taken 13 wickets in 7 innings, including the crucial dismissal of Ruturaj Gaikwad for 98.In the upcoming match between Mumbai Indians and Lucknow Super Giants, Jasprit Bumrah's track record against key LSG batsmen is notable. He has dismissed K.L. Rahul, Nicholas Pooran, and Devdutt Padikkal twice each in previous encounters. This statistic adds an interesting dimension to the contest between Bumrah and the LSG batting lineup.",The IPL Purple Cap 2024 will be the largest in the history of the Indian Premier League. The cap will be worth an estimated $1.2 billion. It is the largest cap in the league's history. It will also be the most expensive in the world.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109681945,imgsize-59894,width-400,resizemode-4/109681945.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings opener and skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad on Wednesday overtook Royal Challengers Bengaluru's Virat Kohli to become the leading run-scorer in the ongoing edition of the Indian Premier League.After scoring Ruturaj Gaikwad 62 against Punjab Kings in match 49, Ruturaj surpassed Kohli (500) to become the new Orange Cap holder.Ruturaj now has 509 runs in 10 matches.Gujarat Titans' Sai Sudharsan (418) and Lucknow Super Giants' KL Rahul (406) occupy the third and fourth spot respectively on the list. Delhi Capitals' Rishabh Pant is on fifth place with 398 runs in 11 matches.Earlier, in match 48th of IPL 2024, Lucknow Super Giants secured a thrilling four-wicket victory against Mumbai Indians at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in the ongoing IPL 2024, thanks to yet another rescue act by Marcus Stoinis. Despite a shaky start and a middle-order collapse, Stoinis played a pivotal role, ensuring victory for the hosts.In the face of a challenging chase of 145 runs, LSG encountered early difficulties, but skipper KL Rahul and Marcus Stoinis steadied the ship with a crucial 58-run partnership. While Rahul showcased solidity with his 28-run contribution, Stoinis took charge, anchoring the innings with a well-compiled 62.KL Rahul's innings of 28 runs in the match helped him secure the fourth position in the IPL 2024 orange cap race. He crossed the 400-run mark for the season, currently tallying 406 runs in 10 innings. Rahul became the fourth batter in the season to reach the 400-run mark.Virat Kohli, continuing his scorching form, added another half-century to his tally against Gujarat Titans.

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Leg-spinner Piyush Chawla stated that India captain and Mumbai Indians opener Rohit Sharma was compelled to play as an impact substitute in the IPL match against Kolkata Knight Riders because of a ""mild back stiffness"".Their 24-run defeat against KKR, in which Rohit was an impact substitute, saw him score just 11 runs in 12 balls in the second innings. This loss almost saw the five-time winners eliminated from the IPL this year.""He just had a mild back stiffness so it was just a precautionary thing,"" Chawla told the media after the match here at the Wankhede Stadium.Mumbai's eighth loss in 11 games has put an end to the Hardik Pandya-led team, and Chawla also acknowledged that their only remaining motivation is ""pride"".""For the pride and the reputation, because sometimes when you enter on the field, you don't think whether you are going to qualify or you are not going to qualify,"" he said.""You have to play for your name and that's what we are playing for,"" he added.MI's lack of momentum throughout this IPL season, according to Chawla, is the cause of their subpar play.""You must have often heard about that T20 is all about momentum and just that we didn't get that momentum going this season and it can happen to any team,"" he said.""It's not like it's happening to us for the first time or any other team for the second time. It can happen to anyone and it's just that that momentum was not our way.""On Friday, the 35-year-old Chawla overtook Dwayne Bravo to claim 184 wickets, becoming him the second-highest wicket-taker in the IPL.""It has been a beautiful journey because IPL started 17 years back and at that time nobody gave that much preference to the spinners, but now if you see that in top few wicket takers in India, especially all the spinners, Ashwin, Yuzhi, myself (are there), so it's a good feeling,"" he said.In addition, Chawla commended Manish Pandey for his performance in his first game of the season despite being under pressure. As KKR scored 169 all out in 19.5 overs, Pandey (42) and Venkatesh Iyer (70) shared 83 runs for the sixth wicket.""It was a good partnership and credit has to go to them because they batted beautifully. Well, T20 is something in which experience plays a big role, (which is) what we saw today.""When Manish walked in, maybe if somebody walks in who must have played few games, he would have panicked that runs are not coming.""But he read the situation and the way he handled the situation because if you see in starting, he was hardly going at run a ball. But later on, he knew that he has to stand there with Venky.""","Rohit Sharma was forced to play as an impact substitute in IPL match against Kolkata Knight Riders. Leg-spinner Piyush Chawla said Sharma had a ""mild back stiffness"" Mumbai's 24-run defeat against KKR almost saw the five-time winners eliminated from the IPL.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109832694,imgsize-62202,width-400,resizemode-4/109832694.jpg"
Rohit Sharma's 20:20 spin vision: Indian skipper says he wanted four tweakers in T20 World Cup squad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/rohit-sharmas-2020-spin-vision-indian-skipper-says-he-wanted-four-tweakers-in-t20-world-cup-squad/articleshow/109800346.cms,"India's games start at 10 AM and dew will not play a major role

Dube for middle-order power

'In IPL, performances change daily'

MUMBAI: Keeping in mind the conditions in the Caribbean, where the wickets are likely to be low, slow and sluggish, the unusually early start timings for India's matches - 10 am local time - and perhaps also the ordinary form of their pacers barring Jasprit Bumrah , India have clearly devised a bowling plan for the upcoming T20 World Cup based around a heavy diet of spin.While Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel are the left-arm spinning allrounders in the squad, Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal are the two wrist spinners. On Thursday, captain Rohit Sharma , while trying to avoid giving out too much in terms of team strategy, justified the logic of having picked four spinners and just three pacers in the 15-member squad.""I don't want to go too much into details. I'm sure opposition captains are listening to this. I wanted four spinners. We've played a lot of cricket there (Caribbean). We know what the conditions are like. With a morning start at 10-10.30am, there's a little bit of technical aspect involved in this,"" Rohit said.""The reason for picking four spinners is something I won't reveal now. I wanted four spinners. With two of them being allrounders (Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja) and two attacking options (Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal), it gives you balance. Based on the opposition, we can decide who to play,"" the captain stressed.""Maybe when I do the first press conference upon landing, I'll give more details,"" he added.After India's failures in the last two T20 World Cups, it's clear that Rohit and the selectors wanted someone to do the heavy lifting in the middle overs against spinners, where acceleration has been a big problem.In that aspect, the skipper is banking on Mumbai allrounder Shivam Dube, who has been in sizzling form for the Chennai Super Kings in the last three IPLs now and has shown the ability to tonk the spinners.In the IPL so far, Dube has smashed 350 runs in 10 matches at a strike rate of 171.56 (average 50.00), in a tally which includes 26 sixes. In the three-match T20I series against Afghanistan at home in January, he carted 124 runs in three innings at a strike-rate of 158.97.""The one thing we really looked at was middle-overs hitting. The top-order hitting has been alright, hasn't been bad, but there are options there as well. In the middle overs, we wanted someone to come and play that role where he can play freely without worrying about who is bowling and who is not. We picked Shivam Dube based on the IPL and a few games before the IPL as well,"" Rohit said.The Indian captain expects Dube to chip in with the ball too, even though he has bowled just one over in this IPL. ""I know Shivam has not bowled much, but he's a seasoned cricketer who bowls a lot of overs in red-ball cricket. If we need Shivam to bowl a few overs, he will bowl. Hardik as well.""Rohit revealed that he had ""70-80%"" of India's World Cup-bound squad in his mind before the IPL.""You make the playing XI in your mind and work around it. The talk of what our final 15 started much before the IPL. In the IPL, performances change every day. Anyone will come and score a hundred or take five wickets.""",India's games start at 10 am local time and dew will not play a major role. Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel are the left-arm spinning allrounders in the squad.

LUCKNOW: Playing their last match on home turf, Lucknow Super Giants LSG ) will have to give it their best shot to edge past Kolkata Knight Riders at the Ekana cricket stadium on Sunday. KKR are a step away from a berth in the Playoffs with 14 spots.In their previous match against Mumbai Indians, LSG were far from convincing as they had to toil hard to chase the modest 145-run target.On the batting side, LSG skipper KL Rahul is in form up the order and has played some fine knocks, smashing fifties against Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings.Allrounder Marcus Stoinis also played well against MI, scoring 62 runs, and had also played a spectacular match-winning innings against CSK. Deepak Hooda has also played some decent knocks. Wicketkeeper-batter Nicholas Pooran has not been able to make his mark in the last 2-3 matches and it is time for him to put his best foot forward. Top-order batter Quinton de Kock missed the last match against MI and he was back early to the pavilion against Rajasthan Royals.On the bowling side, LSG's bowlers will also face a harsh test with none of them making a real dent with individual brilliance. In the last match, Mohsin Khan, Marcus Stoinis, Naveen-ul-Haq and Mayank Yadav did well against MI. LSG will now have to go without pace sensation Mayank, who had walked out of the last match against MI due to his side strain acting up.Mayank is unlikely to play in the remainder of the IPL . LSG head coach Justin Langer said, ""We'll be praying that he can play hopefully in the play-offs but I am a realist as well.

Virat Kohli , who had lost the Orange Cap as IPL 2024 's top scorer to Chennai Super Kings' captain Ruturaj Gaikwad earlier this week, reclaimed it with his 42-run knock for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in their victory over Gujarat Titans in Bengaluru on Saturday. But it was not just his breezy knock but also his cheeky gesture after receiving the cap from teammate Dinesh Karthik that broke the internet.Kohli's 42 came off just 27 balls at a strike rate of 155.56, while he put up an opening partnership of 92 runs with RCB skipper and top-scorer Faf du PLessis who struck a sublime 23-ball 62, which included 10 four and 3 sixes.However, RCB's middle order caved in against Joshua Litle (4/42) while chasing Gujarat Titans's below-par 147.But the Kohli-Du Plessis partnership had done enough damage at the top, as veteran finisher Karthik (21* off 12 balls) and Swapil Singh (15* off 9) took the team home in 13.4 overs for a four-wicket win.Kohli's knock took him past Gaikwad in the Orange Cap standings CSK's Gaikwad was nine runs ahead before the start of Friday's match.

NEW DELHI: Following the Mumbai Indians ' clash with the Kolkata Knight Riders , Australian World Cup-winning all-rounder Shane Watson commented that the Kolkata-based franchise did not deserve to win the match due to their initial loss of five wickets in quick succession.KKR secured a 24-run victory against MI at the Wankhede Stadium, powered by an impressive 83-run partnership between Venkatesh Iyer and Manish Pandey, complemented by Mitchell Starc 's outstanding bowling performance, claiming figures of 4-33.This win marked Kolkata Knight Riders' first victory at the Wankhede Stadium in 12 years, bringing them closer to the playoff spots in the tournament.The former Australian cricketer emphasized that the Knight Riders had little justification for winning the match after losing their first five wickets so quickly in their encounter against the five-time champions MI.""KKR had no right to win that game tonight after the position they were in five wickets down. It just shows the fight that they have and also just some of the things that happened. Some of the decisions that were made whether that was bowling changes or batting lineup deployment, some of those decisions were very baffling just to really give KKR the upper hand in a game that was just on a knife's edge at certain times,"" Watson said on Jio Cinema.The 42-year-old further mentioned that this victory would significantly boost the confidence of the Shreyas Iyer-led side.""Look that will give KKR so much confidence to know that they don't have to be at their very best and be in a position where the game was nearly done and they've got the fight and determination to find their way to actually get on the right side of the result,"" the two-time IPL champion added.Coming to the match, put to bat first, a solid partnership stand of 83 runs between Venkatesh Iyer (70 off 52) and Manish Pandey (42 off 31) guided KKR to 169. For MI, Jasprit Bumrah was the pick of the bowlers at 3 for 18 in 3.5 overs with two wickets in one over.In reply, MI were bundled out for 145. Starc made a terrific comeback in the tournament returning with a figure of 4-33 in just 3.5 spells, handing KKR a 24-run victory. Varun Chakaravarthy and Sunil Narine both finished with identical figures of 2/22, including some big wickets in the first half of the chase which put KKR on top in the match.Following the win, KKR stand in second place on IPL 2024 standings with 14 points.

Five-time champions Mumbai Indians are all but out of the race to IPL 2024 playoffs. Going through one of their worst seasons in IPL history, Hardik Pandya & Co. faced their eighth defeat in 11 matches, losing to Kolkata Knight Riders by 24 runs on their home ground, Wankhede Stadium , on Friday.The defeat, which was MI's first against KKR at the Wankhede in 12 years, once again brought Hardik 's captaincy in focus.""This was such a good team on paper but was not managed well. The questions that were being raised about Hardik Pandya's captaincy were absolutely correct,"" said former India pacer Irfan Pathan, analysing the game in a video on social media.KKR put up 169 on the board, thanks to a half-century by Venkatesh Iyer (70 off 52 balls) and an equally crucial 31-ball 42 by Manish Pandey, despite MI having the visitors on the ropes at 57/5 in just the seventh over.""When you had KKR's five wickets for just 57 runs, there was no need to give Naman Dhir three overs in a row. You should have got your main bowlers on, but you had your sixth bowler deliver three overs. That allowed Venkatesh Iyer and Manish Pandey to put a partnership together....Where you could have bowled KKR out for 150, they went on to make 170, and that turned out to be the difference,"" added Pathan, raising questions on captain Hardik's decisions on the field.Mitchell Starc , the most expensive player in IPL history, finally did justice to his price tag with match-winning figures of 4/33 as Mumbai folded up for 145 in 18.5 overs despite Suryakumar Yadav's 35-ball 56. Varun Chakravarthy, Sunil Narine and Andre Russell took two wickets each.""KKR now looks like a 'khatarnak' (dangerous) team after Mitchell Starc's return to form. They had just one weak link in fast bowling, which was Mitchell Starc's bowling. The way he bowled to Tim David must be appreciated,"" analysed Irfan.The win took KKR to No. 2 on the points table with seven wins in 10 matches.Coming back to MI captaincy, which had changed hands from Rohit Sharma to Hardik before the start of this season, Irfan said MI is not playing as a unit under Hardik's captaincy.""In cricket, captaincy has a huge effect and it's very important to manage, which did not happen. Mumbai Indians isn't looking like a team that is playing as a unit, and this aspect needs to be looked at going forward for Mumbai Indians. Players need to respect the captain and also accept him appreciably, this is very important.

Aggressive with the bat, unbelievable in the field. [Assessment of conditions] There was more bounce in the wicket, we got that information and the bowlers were consistently really good. We dropped a catch but have been really consistent. Something around 180-90 would have been a good score, but we've seen the way the game has changed,"" Du Plessis said after the match.""Don't look at the scoreboard and play the way that we want to play. It was a bit nerve-racking, another wicket, another wicket. Probably not the best but you're trying to be positive, get your NRR up.

Mumbai City stand between Mohun Bagan and ISL 'double',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/mumbai-city-stand-between-mohun-bagan-and-isl-double/articleshow/109831532.cms,"KOLKATA: It has been the longest and perhaps strangest Indian Super League season. As the dust settles on it with Saturday's grand finale at the Salt Lake Stadium , the order in India's domestic football has already been established.Mohun Bagan SG and Mumbai City FC have emerged truly and decisively as the best in business. Nineteen days after Antonio Lopez Habas 's green-and-maroon brigade pipped the rivals from Mumbai to their maiden the Winners' Shield, they are back again, this time the championship title being up for grabs.There will be more at stake, however and expect fireworks.As Mumbai's Spanish midfielder Alberto Noguera said at the pre-match press conference: ""This is revenge for us. It's an opportunity to show who we are.""Habas does not usually indulge himself in any such hyperbole. But the veteran Spaniard - the lone managerial survivor of the league since its inception a decade ago - made it clear how he was being driven by the sense of the occasion to ""complete the circle"" - of winning the ISL Shield and playoff trophy in the same season.Mumbai City remain the sole owner of this honour. When they achieved this feat back in 2020-2021 season, Habas - then standing as ATK Mohun Bagan coach - ended up getting the wrong end of the stick on both occasions.Having finished the league on top, Habas is certainly salivating at the prospect of crossing the finishing line once more. It could also be a boundary-obliterating push for him as no team has managed to defend the ISL title and a Shield-Cup 'double' will brighten the halo around his managerial accomplishments more.Habas and his opposite in the Mumbai camp Petr Kratky, however, stressed that it will be a different ball game on Saturday, with its own nature of unpredictabilityMumbai, though, are keen on learning from that 1-2 defeat in the league's grand finale here on April 15 and getting even with the new Shield-winners. ""It's a special game for us. We know what quality Mohun Bagan possess but we like to be more pro-active with our passing and control the game this time around,"" their coach Petr Kratky said.When two attacking teams come on a collision path, expect certain patterns to emerge. Both teams flourish in attacking width with wing-backs shaping the team's strategy in slicing open the rival defence. The key to the tie is likely to lie in how they go about using the space behind. Mohun Bagan's Manvir Singh or Liston Colaco and Mumbai City's Lallianzuala Chhangte, Bipin Singh or Jayesh Rane are known for 'hugging' the line, ready to raise their pace to a gallop. Such is the intensity of the system that no player can afford to be isolated, especially during transition when the contest can be won or lost.Apart from Armando Sadiku, Mohun Bagan have all players available. Mumbai will miss Dutch midfielder Yoell van Nieff through suspension and Akash Sharma through injury.Habas and Kratky - having assumed charge in the second half of the league - have imbued their respective team with the feel of a juggernaut. So much about the concept that changing managers in the middle of the season is more about stemming the slide than gunning for glory. So much forMumbai have lost twice to Bagan at the Salt Lake Stadium this season - in the Durand Cup quarterfinals and ISL Shield-decider. Bagan will again enjoy a full house. Can they bring the house down again? Or will Mumbai return to the razzle-dazzle in this rivalry?No quarter will be asked. No mercy will be shown. With the city in the grip of an unprecedented heat wave, expect both teams trying to catch each other cold.",Mohun Bagan SG and Mumbai City FC meet in the final of the Indian Super League.
