This win ensures their progression to the Super Eight stage of the Twenty20 World Cup, with a game left to spare and simultaneously dashes New Zealand's hopes of advancing.Fazalhaq Farooqi led the Afghan bowling attack with impressive figures of 3-16.

NEW DELHI:Pakistan, though not playing, will be closely watching the outcome of the USA and Ireland match in Group A at Lauderhill , Florida, on Friday.A victory for the USA, who currently have four points, would spell the end of Pakistan's World Cup hopes. Pakistan has only earned two points from their three matches. Such a result would also propel the co-hosts, USA and India, into the Super Eight stage from this group.Ireland, despite having experienced players, have struggled in this tournament. They face a tough challenge against a USA team that’s been performing well in T20 cricket.USA's focus will be on the fitness of captain Monank Patel, who missed the match against India on Wednesday due to a left-shoulder injury. Aaron Jones took over the captaincy for the game against India in New York.Weather forecasts hint at a strong possibility of rain, and even a washout would eliminate Pakistan from the competition. A no-result scenario would give the USA five points, making it impossible for Pakistan to catch up, as they can only accumulate a maximum of four points.The 30th match of the T20 World Cup 2024 is set to be an exciting clash between the United States (USA) and Ireland (IRE) at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground in Lauderhill, Florida. Scheduled for June 14 at 8:00 PM IST, this match promises to be a thrilling encounter.The head-to-head record between the two teams is heavily in favour of Ireland, who have won five out of the six matches played against the United States. However, in T20 cricket, any team can win on their day, so the USA will be looking to turn the tide in this encounter.The pitch at Lauderhill is usually good for batting, but with recent rains, there could be some moisture that might assist the seamers.Top-order batsmen will be crucial fantasy picks, as scoring could be easier early on when the ball is new and hard. Spinners and bowlers who excel in the death overs could also play significant roles.He is of Indian origin, has been showcasing excellent form with his left-arm pace for the USA. Netravalkar is delivering economical spells while effectively picking up crucial wickets. He stands out as a key player for the upcoming match.He is a crucial figure in the United States batting lineup. He notably played a stellar inning against Canada and has managed another decent performance in tough conditions since then. Given his current form, Jones is anticipated to be a valuable asset.He is a significant strength in the Irish bowling unit. The right-arm pacer can be particularly dangerous with the new ball and also offers useful contributions with the bat in the lower order. Adair is expected to secure points in both innings for his team.Paul Stirling (c), Mark Adair, Ross Adair, Andrew Balbirnie, Curtis Campher, Gareth Delany, George Dockrell, Graham Hume, Josh Little, Barry McCarthy, Neil Rock, Harry Tector, Lorcan Tucker, Ben White, Craig Young.Monank Patel (c), Aaron Jones, Andries Gous, Corey Anderson , Ali Khan, Harmeet Singh, Jessy Singh, Milind Kumar, Nisarg Patel, Nitish Kumar , Noshtush Kenjige, Saurabh Nethralvakar, Shadley Van Schalkwyk, Steven Taylor, Shayan Jahangir.

The washout in Group A match of the T20 World Cup between USA and Ireland in Florida on Thursday pushed Pakistan out of T20 World Cup 2024 in the first stage itself. The sorry exit of 2009 champions angered the nation and led to a scathing criticism of Babar Azam's team. Amid that, the hypothesis of former wicketkeeper-batsman Kamran Akmal , with India's batting legend Virat Kohli central to the context, is both interesting as well as an admission of Pakistan's past mistakes.Speaking on a TV show in Pakistan, Kamran suggested that had his brother Umar Akmal been backed and promoted, he could have done things like Virat Kohli has done for India despite not being even close to the kind of talent Kohli possesses.""Mujhe stats kal aaye hain. Mein baat kar raha hu Umar ki (I have received the stats yesterday, I am talking about Umar). World Cup matches in T20s, Umar and Virat Kohli's. Umar is like Virat Kohli's little finger, (compared to) the performance and stature of Virat Kohli, the kind of player he is. (But Umar has) Better strike rate than Virat Kohli, runs as well (in T20 World Cups),"" said Kamran in the video clip floating on microblogging platform 'X'.""Hamari koi PR company nahi hai. We don't spread our stats on social media. If these stats (of Umar) were part of these 15 players (Pakistan's T20 World Cup squad), is waqt tak tabahi aa jani thi (it would have created mayhem),"" the former stumper added, and went on to highlight Kohli's 80 centuries in international cricket.Pakistan desperately needed the USA vs Ireland match to go ahead and required Ireland to beat USA to help their chances of qualification for 'Super 8s' from Group A. But the no-result outcome gave USA the one point they needed to push Pakistan out of this World Cup.Now even if Pakistan go on to beat Ireland on Sunday, they will only end up on four points compared to tournament debutant USA's five. Interestingly, it was the upset defeat against USA in their first match that cost Pakistan an embarrassing early exit.The history-making US team advance to the next stage with group toppers India, who are enjoying a three-match unbeaten run.","Pakistan out of T20 World Cup 2024 in the first stage itself.

The comprehensive victory marked the biggest opening game margin in the tournament's history.Furthermore, it serves as a strong statement of intent from the Germans, who were considered somewhat lacklustre ahead of the tournament but are pursuing an unprecedented fourth European title and their first major trophy in a decade.The hosts took control of the match early on, with Florian Wirtz , Jamal Musiala , and Kai Havertz 's penalty giving them a commanding 3-0 lead before halftime.Scotland's task was further complicated when defender Ryan Porteous received a straight red card just before the break for a studs-up challenge on Ilkay Gundogan, which also led to the penalty.In the second half, Germany continued to dominate proceedings, with Niclas Fuellkrug and Emre Can adding two more goals to extend their lead to 5-0. Scotland managed to get on the scoresheet in the 87th minute through Antonio Ruediger's deflected own goal, but it was merely a consolation in an otherwise one-sided affair.Germany's performance was a stark contrast to their recent struggles in major tournaments, where they had lost their opening matches at the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, as well as the previousEuropean Championship in 2021.The Germans' dominance was evident in their possession statistics and the ease with which they carved open the Scottish defence. Their clinical finishing and relentless attacking play left Scotland with no respite, as the visitors failed to register a single shot on or off target throughout the match.For Scotland, who were making their second consecutive appearance at the European Championship under coach Steve Clarke, the defeat was a harsh reality check. They now face an uphill battle to progress from the group stage for the first time in a major tournament, with their next match against Switzerland on Wednesday taking on added significance.Germany, on the other hand, will look to build on this impressive start when they face Hungary in their second Group A encounter on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: The T20 World Cup's initial group stage is nearing its completion, with three spots remaining for the next round -- the 'Super 8s'. As the qualification scenarios stand currently, defending champions England, Bangladesh and debutants USA are most likely to join the other five teams who have qualified.The two big teams that have already been eliminated from the tournament are New Zealand and Sri Lanka, with Pakistan's chances hanging by a thread after defeat against arch rivals India and a shock loss to the US.As of now, India are on top of Group A, Australia lead Group B, Afghanistan are No. 1 in Group C, and South Africa are the toppers in Group D.The one remaining spot on offer in Group B is being contested between neighbours England and Scotland. England's first game in the group was washed out against Scotland, and they lost the next to traditional rivals Australia. England's comprehensive victory over Oman in 19 balls has improved their chances immensely, but they still need to beat Namibia and hope the Scots don't upset Australia.England are currently in third position with three points from their three games and a net run rate of +3.081. They need to win their last match in the group stage to secure five points. That will bring them on equal points with Scotland (5 each) if the Scots lose their concluding group game against Australia, which is likely. In that eventually, England, who already have a better net run rate than Scotland, will go through.With England's qualification still not confirmed, Australia fast bowler Josh Hazlewood said, ""In this tournament, you potentially come up against England at some stage again, and they're probably one of the top few teams on their day. We've had some real struggles against them in T20 cricket, so if we can get them out of the tournament, that's in our best interest as well as probably everyone else's. It'll be interesting to see. We've never really been in this position before as a team.""Hazlewood has no doubt that Australia will aim for a clean sweep in the group by defeating Scotland, but there is also the temptation to assist Scotland in maintaining their net run rate over England. ""There are a few options, like getting close and just knocking it around to drag it out,"" Hazlewood added.As of June 13, five teams have already booked a spot in the T20 World Cup Super 8s' stage. India, Australia, Afghanistan, West Indies and South Africa have advanced to the next round. All these teams have played three matches each and remain undefeated in their respective groups.An exciting match is on the horizon when Afghanistan take on co-hosts West Indies in Group C. The result in this match will end the unbeaten run of one of these two teams before entering the 'Super 8s'.Group 1: A1 (India), B2 (Australia), C1 (New Zealand), D2 (Sri Lanka)Group 2: A2 (Pakistan), B1 (England), C2 (West Indies), D1 (South Africa)Afghanistan will be playing as C1 since New Zealand have been knocked out of the T20 World Cup 2024, and Bangladesh are looking like a strong contender for D2 to replace Sri Lanka, who have also bowed out.If USA win their last match against Ireland or it gets washed out by rain, they will replace Pakistan as A2. On the other hand, if Scotland manage to upset Australia, they will take England's spot as B1. If Scotland fail to win against Australia, the decision will come down to net run rate.","The T20 World Cup's initial group stage is nearing its completion.

The 25-year-old was subsequently dropped for the next match against India, which Pakistan lost by six runs.After the match, a video surfaced on social media showing Khan eating street food late at midnight in New York.Khan faced extensive trolling on social media platforms for his actions.Former Pakistan captain and Team Director Mohammad Hafeez criticised Khan on Friday, revealing some shocking details about him.Hafeez, appointed as Team Director in November last year, was sacked by the PCB just three months later following the team's embarrassing 3-0 Test series loss to Australia and a 4-1 T20I series defeat to New Zealand.During his tenure, Hafeez supported Khan in the New Zealand series, but the son of former Pakistan wicketkeeper Moin Khan failed to meet Hafeez's expectations.In a program on a local sports channel, Hafeez called Khan unprofessional and stated that the 25-year-old is not ready to play international cricket.""(On meeting Azam Khan for the first time) Azam Khan, if you want to play cricket for Pakistan, you need to do two things. First, you have to try your best to get physically fit, which is the requirement at the international level. Second, whenever you get an opportunity, you have to perform. I also want you to work hard on your wicket-keeping abilities because with your current fitness, you can't do fielding,"" Hazeez said while speaking to a local sports channel in Pakistan.""I connected Azam Khan with the incumbent Pakistan trainer and shared all the plans with him. Regardless of his body weight and body fat level, I told him that I don't care about that; all I cared about is that you needed to bring your fat level down and improve your running abilities. You need to increase your running abilities so that the team's balance doesn't get affected during the game,"" Hafeez said.""After allotting him a 6-week program, when Azam Khan appeared, he was still at the same body weight and body fat level as he was 6 weeks prior. His running ability was also twice as low as the rest of the team. If the rest of the team could cover 2 kilometers in 10 minutes, Azam Khan could only do it in 20 minutes. So, I went to talk to him and asked him why he didn't follow the plan and role given to him. He didn't have any answer, saying he tried his best but couldn't. This is unprofessionalism,"" the former Pakistan cricketer said.""Then, Azam Khan got another chance and played three matches. I found that this guy is not ready to play international cricket. I told him again that if you want to play for Pakistan, you need to show more commitment. But I didn't see that commitment in him.

The keeper-batter has flourished in this role, scoring 96 runs in 3 games with his varied shot selection.Sreesanth feels that if Kohli returns to his number three spot, Pant will continue to excel.The former pacer believes Pant is adaptable and can thrive in different situations and positions in the batting order.""Pant is a player who can adapt to any situation. We have seen him bat at different positions. He is a brilliant player, and I think Pant will be happy if Virat goes at number three. Pant doesn't look at the situation, wicket or the bowler. He just looks at the ball. I think that is a quality that youngsters should focus on. I think he loves Virat, and he would love to see Virat score more runs. If Virat comes just before him, imagine the freedom that Pant gets, he might just hit the reverse sweep on the first ball. So that is Pant,"" Sreesanth, who features as an expert on Disney+ Hotstar, said while speaking exclusively to ANI.Pant made his return to cricket in the IPL 2024 season as the skipper of the Delhi Capitals after sustaining injuries in a car accident in December 2022. He scored 446 runs in 13 matches, with an average of 40.55 and a strike rate of 155.40.India remains unbeaten in the T20 World Cup, having defeated Ireland, Pakistan, and co-hosts USA.Sreesanth sees no reason the Indian team shouldn't aim for the title, citing their strength and talent.We have such great bench strength. I don't see any reason why we shouldn't be winning it. Whenever we talk about the World Cup, they show wins of 2009, 2011 and 1983. It is high time this team genuinely deserves to win the World Cup. Next time, pictures of the current edition will be shown.In last year's ODI World Cup, India reached the final undefeated but fell short against Australia. Sreesanth is hopeful that this time, India can seek revenge if both teams reach the final, drawing comparisons to past tournament triumphs.""It feels good, and the way the team is performing it makes you remember the 2007 T20 World Cup. This time, Pakistan is going out, and India is moving forward. The way Bumrah and others are performing, especially in terms of character, India is way ahead. If anybody is going to challenge India, I think it is going towards, India vs Australia final. The result that didn't take place in the 50-over World Cup, I hope India takes revenge this time and we bring the cup back to India,"" he stated.After securing a spot in the Super 8, India will play their final group stage game against Canada in Florida on Saturday.","Former India pacer Sreesanth believes Rishabh Pant would be happy to see Virat Kohli bat at number three and score runs.

Pakistan batsman Imam-ul-Haq has thrown his weight behind the under-fire captain Babar Azam as Pakistan stare at an early exit from the T20 World Cup .Pakistan's consecutive defeats against USA and India in Group A has put their campaign in disarray. The 2009 champions came back to defeat Canada and kept their hopes of reaching the 'Super 8s' alive, but their fate is no longer in their own hands alone.The flash floods in Florida threaten to wash out all three remaining matches in Group A, while Pakistan desperately want Ireland to beat USA before they take on the Irish team in the concluding fixture of the group.In case of no result in the USA vs Ireland match on June 14, Pakistan will be eliminated and co-hosts USA will join India as the two teams to advance to the next stage from Group A.Amid all those qualification scenarios, the Pakistan team and Babar Azam have been facing continuing criticism for their lackluster show, especially for losing against archrivals India from a winning position.Pakistan batsman Ahmed Shehzad has lambasted the team's performance in no uncertain words, questionining Babar's record as a captain and as a batter in ICC tournaments. He has also taken the team to task on the selection of an unfit Azam Khan , who has often been body-shamed on social media for his heavyset body.But another Pakistan batsman, Imam ul Haq , has come out in defence of Babar, questioning those who denounce body-shaming but don't hold themselves back from disrepsecting the captain of the national team with their harsh words.'If the element of respect is coming in the case of Azam Khan, that do not body-shame him, then it should be the same in Babar's case as well...He has also played for Pakistan, has played 250 international matches. You showed 20 stats of him related to World Cup, but what I ask is that if he has an average of 50 in all three formats, who will answer (consider) that?"" said Imam while speaking on a TV show in Pakistan.'You cricitise on national TV, that's your right (because) it's the Pakistan team....but remember one thing, the element of respect should never be taken out. He (Babar) is your captain. You want to remove him from captaincy, do that, nobody has a problem with that. You don't want to consider him 'King', don't. His fans have made him, what you say doesn't matter,"" he added.Babar was reinstated as Pakistan captain in the white-ball formats after he stepped down from the role following Pakistan's poor show at the ODI World Cup in India last year.Fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi replaced Babar as the skipper but lasted just a solitary series before the Paksitan Cricket Board decided to hand over the team's reins back to Babar.So far in this T20 World Cup, Babar's knocks don't actually make for a bad reading, especially on the US tracks that haven't been conducive to batting. His top score of 44 came against USA, while he failed in the match against India, scoring 13. Against Canada, Babar made 33 runs.""I am not justifying him (Babar),"" said Imam. ""He hasn't won you tournaments as a captain, that's the problem, right? So he should be asked questions. If he isn't able to do that, then do change him...but the element of respect should be there.""",Pakistan's consecutive defeats against USA and India in Group A has put their campaign in disarray.

One of India's greatest batsmen Virender Sehwag needs no introduction; but Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan made an impression, possibly sarcastically because of his latest criticism by the former India opener, that he didn't exactly identify who the journalist mentioned in his question.Bangladesh are all but through to the 'Super 8s' stage of the T20 World Cup having won two of their three matches in Group D, including a win over former champions Sri Lanka.On Thursday, the 'Bengal Tigers' defeated Netherlands, after which a video clip of Shakib at the post-match press conference went viral.Listening to a mediaperson's question on Sehwag criticising his batting, the Bangladesh captain stopped the journalist in between and asked ""Who?"", and the clip, which ends at that moment, went viral.Journalist: ""There has been a lot of discussion about your performance, especially a comment by Virender Sehwag that has received much attention...""Shakib: ""Who?""However, the veteran allrounder, who rediscovered his batting form with a stroke-filled 64 not out of 46 deliveries in Bangladesh's 25-run win over Netherlands, did go on to complete his reply.""A player doesn't play to answer (the critics). His job is to contribute to the team. If he is not able to do that, there will be a lot of talk. I think it's not such a bad thing,"" he said.Sehwag had criticised Shakib for his poor run in the first two matches against Sri Lanka and South Africa.""If he was included in the squad for experience, then we were not able to see it. At least spend some time at this wicket! It is not like you are Hayden or Gilchrist who can play a pull shot off a short ball, you are just a player from Bangladesh. Play according to your standards. When you are not able to play hook or pull, so just play the strokes that you know,"" Sehwag had said on Cricbuzz.","Bangladesh are all but through to the 'Super 8s' stage of the T20 World Cup.

NEW DELHI: Gautam Gambhir , the mentor of Kolkata Knight Riders ( KKR ) and former India opener, is emerging as the leading candidate for the position of head coach of the Indian national cricket team as per recent media reports.The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is on the lookout for a successor to the current coach, Rahul Dravid , whose term concludes after the ongoing 2024 ICC T20 World Cup.Gambhir's potential candidacy is bolstered by his recent achievement of guiding KKR to an IPL title as a mentor. Anil Kumble , the former Indian cricketer and legendary spinner, stated that coaching a national team is quite different from coaching a franchise. Kumble emphasized the importance of strong leadership, especially given the transitional phase with several senior players nearing the end of their careers.""Rahul has done a fantastic job, and hopefully, for him and India's sake, he has a swansong with the World Cup. What you also have to keep in mind is that some of the senior players are coming towards the backend of their careers. You need players who go through the transition period and ensure India doesn't miss out on the quality in the bowling and batting department. You pick and choose and transition through,"" Kumble told ESPNCricinfo.""You have to give it time. He certainly is capable. We have seen Gautam handle teams. He has been a captain for India, for his franchise, for Delhi. He has all the credentials to be that. But the Indian team's coaching is slightly different, you have to give him time to settle in. Like I mentioned, in case he takes up the job, he will have the task of looking at not just the current lot, but also the future of Indian cricket,"" Kumble elaborated.Gambhir is well-acquainted with many senior players in the current Indian team, alongside upcoming talents like Rinku Singh. However, Kumble believes that this familiarity may not play a significant role in the selection process.""Today, you have been a part of the system in some form or the other. Whether you're a coach or player, you've played with them or been associated with them in some form or the other. It doesn't matter that much. What you look at is the candidature and not whether this particular coach has a background of playing with the players,"" Kumble said.""I think it's important to choose the right candidate in terms of what they can bring to the Indian team, and someone who has the stature and the credibility to handle the certain situations in the game. Someone who is not afraid to take those calls,"" Kumble added.Selecting the new head coach entails considering their ability to navigate the team through transitional periods while maintaining performance.With Gambhir's track record as a player and mentor, he seems equipped to handle the challenges, provided he gets the necessary time to establish his role.","The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is on the lookout for a successor to the current coach, Rahul Dravid.

He has been a key player for the team in this T20 World Cup, delivering crucial performances at No. 3. His wicketkeeping skills have also been outstanding.""The best thing is that Rishabh has done so well in his comeback. Especially the batting is considered to be very good. But one of the good things about him is the way he came back as a wicketkeeper,"" Dilip said ahead of the team's last group league game against Canada.For the fielding coach, Pant’s smooth lateral movements post-surgery are particularly significant.""Especially with an injury he had, to come back as a wicketkeeper and do that lateral movement, so that is very heartening to see.""Commenting on Pant's batting strategy, the coach mentioned that the player practices intense simulations in the nets, which aids him during actual matches.""Coming to your question about batting differently, having different plans in the match, it's a strategy, it's something which Rishabh always does, is that he tries everything in practice whatever comes in a match so that he is well prepared with his options whatever he wants to try in a match.""Dilip has been with the team for over two years and noted remarkable improvements in the fast bowlers' fielding abilities, particularly in critical positions. An example of this is Mohammed Siraj’s catch of USA's Nitish Kumar at deep mid-wicket.""If I really want to go to specifics, what's heartening to see is the bowlers doing really well. Yes, Jadeja is very good, Virat Kohli is good, Rohit Sharma is good. They were doing very well before.""But then what's happening is the bowlers doing really well, which is adding up as you can see that now the bowlers are standing in hot spots. So, that's a great sign for a team.""So that, what will happen in that, Rohit Sharma will get the versatility (options) that he doesn't have to look for any place. That versatility is allowing him to keep good fielders at positions all the time.""When asked for more details, Dilip highlighted that bowlers, even after long spells, return the next day for optional training sessions.""After long bowling spells and coming back and especially most of the optional sessions, they are taking that initiative to come for the practice. That is first thing.""And in that process, two important things we did in this, we try to do in this tournament, is attitude and attention to detail.""Attention to detail means when the ball is going on the boundary... slow outfield, you all were never giving up till last moment, backing up when somebody is throwing.""Dilip, who has experience working with notable baseball coach Mike King, stated that he incorporates some baseball throwing techniques into cricket practice.""I love it because there are certain things which I have been using for pretty long, because back in there, I had an opportunity to work with Mike King, with an Australian team. He was a baseball player, so quite a few inputs from that game have really helped me in cricket,"" said Dilip, who along with a few players and support staff, went to watch a Yankees game during their stay in New York.""Other day, we went to Yankees Stadium, so we watched some baseball stuff out there and we met an NFL player, so it's diverse sports, so we try to get in what we can learn from other sports, so it gives an opportunity to look into other sports.""","Rishabh Pant made his competitive cricket comeback in the last IPL after a long recovery from a severe car accident in December 2022.

NEW DELHI: First-timers USA, featuring several players who juggle cricket with their primary occupations, on Friday advanced to the next round of the 2024 T20 World Cup in the Americas after their last Group A match against Ireland in Lauderhill, Florida got washed out.The USA vs Ireland washout meant that the 2009 champions Pakistan were eliminated from the tournament.Riding victories against neighbors Canada and tournament heavyweights Pakistan in their initial matches, the USA secured a spot in the Super Eight stage.Their final group match's cancellation allowed them to join India in the next round of the cricketing extravaganza.The USA ended the group stage with five points from four matches.Now even if Pakistan win their remaining match against Ireland, they can only achieve a maximum of four points.Pakistan had already faced setbacks prior to the washout. They lost narrowly to India in New York while chasing a target of 120.Earlier, their opening match in Dallas ended in a surprising Super Over defeat to the USA.The consecutive losses meant Pakistan's progression to the Super Eight depended on other results.The tournament is being jointly hosted by the USA and the West Indies as part of an ICC initiative aimed at expanding cricket's footprint in the region.The USA team's performance so far suggests a genuine attempt to entice NFL, MLB, and NBA fans towards cricket.The USA began their campaign with a decisive victory over Canada, chasing nearly 200 runs. They then pulled off one of the T20 World Cup's biggest upsets by beating Pakistan.In their match against India, they posed a strong challenge to the title contenders. USA's momentum can be traced back to their morale-boosting T20I series win against Bangladesh ahead of the tournament.The USA team includes eight players of Indian descent, many of whom hold temporary H1-B visas that allow companies to employ international workers. These players are helping to revive cricket in the USA, a country that hosted the first international cricket match in 1844 between the USA and Canada, predating even the first Test match between England and Australia.Anticipation that Friday's match might be cancelled was high due to a tropical thunderstorm that struck Florida, causing incessant rain and flash flooding.Yet, even if the match had taken place, the USA team, emboldened by their earlier victories and a strong showing against India, would have backed themselves to defeat Ireland and advance to the Super Eights.","First-timers USA advance to next round of 2024 T20 World Cup in the Americas.

The match concluded as Lamens hit another groundstroke into the net.Despite admitting that grass is not her preferred surface, with her four Grand Slam titles coming on the hard courts of the US and Australian Opens, Osaka appears to be gradually regaining the form that once took her to the top of the world rankings.She has never advanced beyond the third round at Wimbledon but recently pushed eventual French Open champion Iga Swiatek to match point in the second round, the toughest challenge the world number one faced on the Parisian clay.","Former world number one Naomi Osaka beats Suzan Lamens in straight sets.
