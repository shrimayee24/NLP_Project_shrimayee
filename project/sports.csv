NEW DELHI: Despite grappling with the absence of key bowlers due to injuries and international commitments, Chennai Super Kings are determined to exhibit their on-field dominance as they face off against the struggling Gujarat Titans in the 12th round of the IPL today at the iconic Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.Positioned in a mid-table logjam with 12 points from 11 games, this away fixture holds significant importance for Ruturaj Gaikwad 's squad, who are still battling to secure a playoff berth, with a defeat potentially dealing a severe blow to their aspirations.A victory would catapult them to third place in the standings, surpassing Sunrisers Hyderabad by virtue of a superior net run-rate. Among the trio of teams locked on 12 points, only CSK (+0.700) boasts a positive net run-rate.While on paper, GT is at the bottom of IPL 2024 points table but Titans theoretically remain in contention, their maximum achievable tally of 14 points renders it an arduous task for the Shubman Gill-led side to break into the top four.With just one win from their last five outings, the Titans are struggling with confidence and have faced challenges across all facets of the game.With six encounters between them, the rivalry stands evenly poised, with both teams securing victories in three matches each.Also see: IPL live score The Narendra Modi Stadium wicket has proven to be a balanced one, offering something for both batsmen and bowlers alike. While it has witnessed high-scoring encounters, bowlers have also found success, ensuring a thrilling battle between bat and ball. As a result, spectators can anticipate a closely contested match with excitement brimming from both sides.Also see: IPL match result Narendra Modi Stadium in IPL 2024 has hosted 5 matches so far, with teams winning batting first only once while chasing has proven successful on 4 occasions.The average first innings total stands at 164, while teams batting second have averaged 166 runs. The highest total registered was an impressive 206/1 by Royal Challengers Bengaluru against Gujarat Titans, contrasting with the lowest total of 89/10 by the Titans against Delhi Capitals.The pitch initially offers assistance to bowlers, but as the game progresses, it becomes increasingly batsman-friendly. Middle-order batsmen adept at playing attacking shots could rack up valuable points. Additionally, pacers who bowl during the powerplay and death overs are likely to yield the highest fantasy returns, considering the conditions favouring their bowling style.: IPL 2024 has witnessed Ruturaj Gaikwad's batting prowess with 541 runs in 11 innings. While he faced a sluggish start to the tournament, Gaikwad has emerged as a pivotal figure in the CSK lineup, currently ranking as the second-highest run-scorer which makes him second in the IPL 2024 Orange Cap . His recent performances highlight his reliability, making him a dependable choice for fantasy contests.Shivam Dube's IPL 2024 journey reflects 350 runs in 11 matches for CSK. An integral part of the team's middle order, Dube has delivered impactful innings throughout the tournament. Despite facing golden ducks in his last two outings, his consistent form prior suggests he shouldn't be discounted in fantasy selections. Dube's ability to bounce back makes him a potentially lucrative pick for fantasy contests.B Sai Sudharsan has been the epitome of consistency for the Gujarat Titans in IPL 2024, accumulating 424 runs in 11 innings.

In short:

How we calculate the chances

With 11 games left to be played in the league stage of IPL 2024, there remain 2,048 possible combinations of match results. No one is yet certain of making the playoffs, but two teams ( MI and PBKS) are totally ruled out.We look at the chances of each team:The team currently topping the table have a 36% chance of finishing the sole toppers and they could do that even with just one win from their remaining three games.Their chances of finishing joint toppers on points are an impressive 62.5%. At worst they can finish tied for third spot. Yet, they are still not sure of making the playoffs. If they lose all their remaining games, they could end up tied third with any two of CSK DC and LSG depending on results in other games, leaving it to net run rates to see who goes through. But there's just a 0.2% chance of such a scenario.Like KKR, they have a 36% chance of being sole toppers at the end of the league phase and a 62.5% chance of being at least tied for the first spot on points. Yet, they too are still not sure of making the playoffs. If they lose all their remaining games, they could end up tied third with any two of CSK, DC or LSG depending on results in other games. But again, there's just a 0.8% chance of such a scenario.Currently in third place, SRH have nearly 97% chance of finishing among the top four in terms of points. The best they can hope for is a joint first spot with one or two other teams and the chances of that are a little over 2%.In fourth place despite Friday's loss, CSK have a little over 56% chance of finishing within the top four slots either singly or jointly. The best they can do is tied for second spot with one to three other teams. And the chances of that are just 7%.Fifth placed DC have no chance of finishing the toppers or even joint toppers. Their chances of ending up among the top four singly or jointly are about 58%. Their best case scenario is joint second on points and there's a little under 5% chance of that happening.Sixth placed LSG's chances of making the top four singly or jointly are also about 58%. Like DC, the best they can do is tie for the second spot with one to three other teams. The chances of that happening are just under 5%.RCB remain in seventh place and their chances of finishing among the top four on points, singly or jointly, are a tad over 20%. Their best case scenario is joint third with two to five other teams and the chances of that are a little under 5%.With Friday's win, GT have climbed off the bottom of the table, but their chances of making it to the top four on points, singly or jointly, are still under 16%. Their best case scenario is joint third with three to five other teams and there's a less than 5% chance of that happening.Their run for the playoffs have ended. Even the chances of a joint fifth spot are a lowly 0.6%.MI too are out of the playoffs. They can at best end up joint 5th and even that is just a 1.2% chance.Bet on KKR and RR making the playoffs and SRH most likely to join them, leaving CSK, LSG and DC battling it out for the fourth spot. For RCB or GT to get into the mix would need many results to go their way.With 11 games remaining, there remain 2,048 possible combinations of match outcomes. We look at each one of those and what it would mean in terms of the final rankings of the teams. Then we work out the percentage of outcomes that would give team ""A"" a chance of finishing in the top four, or the first spot and so on. The underlying assumption is that any given match is a 50-50 game, not unreasonable given how the IPL has unfolded this year and in other years. For instance, of the 2,048 combinations, GT finish among the top four slots singly or jointly in only 320 combinations, which means a 15.6% chance of making the top four spots singly or jointly.","No one is yet certain of making the playoffs, but two teams ( MI and PBKS) are totally ruled out. With 11 games remaining, there remain 2,048 possible combinations of match outcomes. We look at each one of those and what it would mean in terms of the final rankings of the teams.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110025041,imgsize-61812,width-400,resizemode-4/110025041.jpg"

Bhai mera kya mera to ye last hai

NEW DELHI: Just before the 2024 edition, when five-time IPL champions Mumbai Indians announced that they are replacing Rohit Sharma by Hardik Pandya as captain, things haven't looked good for the franchise.The move came as a rude shock for the MI fans and they thronged the stadiums extending their support to Rohit by cheering and chanting his name and even booed Pandya by loud jeers.The hatred for Pandya had increased so much that former cricketer-turned-commentator had to ask fans to ""behave"" when the MI skipper had turned up at the toss before an IPL game at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.Such has been the downfall for Mumbai Indians that they became the first side to be eliminated from the playoff race having lost 8 of their 12 matches and are now languishing at the ninth spot in the points table.Pandya's captaincy has been under scrutiny and he has been slammed for his timid approach and haphazard decisions throughout the tournament.Now ahead of the match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Mumbai Indians at the Eden Gardenson Saturday, a video is going viral where Rohit Sharma can be seen talking to KKR assistant coach Abhishek Nayar .Though the noise in the video is not clear due to constant cheering by fans for Rohit in the background, he can be heard saying, ""The last audible line in the chat is """".Though the rest of the conversation is not audible, fans were quick to react on it and speculated that Rohit was talking about the MI captaincy and some fans even alleged that KKR had deleted the video after uploading it on X.Rohit Sharma and Abhishek Nayar go back a long way from their Mumbai domestic cricket days and are good friends. Nayar is also credited with playing a big role in Rohit's comeback into the Indian team after 2011 ODI World Cup snub.","Rohit Sharma can be seen talking to KKR assistant coach Abhishek Nayar.

End of Rahul Dravid era? BCCI to search for new head coach after T20 World Cup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/end-of-rahul-dravid-era-bcci-to-search-for-new-head-coach-after-t20-world-cup/articleshow/110025401.cms,"Cannot say whether new coach will be Indian or foreign, says BCCI secretary

Impact Player rule was a 'test case'

2027 WTC final

may be held outside UK

No increase in domestic match fee

MUMBAI: Rahul Dravid 's stint as the Indian cricket team 's head coach may be coming to an end, with BCCI secretary Jay Shah announcing that the board will advertise for a new head coach in the next few days. Shah clarified that ""Dravid can reapply for the job, if he wants to"".The new coach will be appointed for a three-year term extending to 2027 ODI World Cup Shah did not rule out the possibility of BCCI hiring a foreign coach. India are unlikely to opt for a split coaching role for limited overs and Test formats.Dravid, who took over in November 2021, was handed a short-term extension till the T20 World Cup in US and Caribbean in June. His two-year contract ended with the team's defeat in the final of ODI World Cup last November.TOI has learnt that Dravid is unlikely to reapply for the current job.Other members of the revamped coaching staff, such as batting, bowling, and fielding coaches, will be decided after consulting the new coach. ""We cannot determine whether the new coach will be Indian or foreign. It will be up to the cricket advisory committee (CAC),"" Shah said.The three-member CAC, headed by former batter Ashok Malhotra and including Jatin Paranjape and Sulakshana Naik, will also have to finalise the appointment of a national selector.Shah was non-committal on the continuation of the controversial 'Impact Player' rule in the IPL and stressed that the issue will be decided after consultation with franchises and broadcasters. However, he defended the rule, introduced in the IPL from 2023, on the grounds that it allows two extra Indian players to be in the XI of an IPL side.""Impact player was a test case. Two new Indian players are getting a chance in the IPL. We will discuss with the stakeholders - franchises and broadcasters - before deciding on the continuation of it . It is not permanent, but no one has provided feedback against the rule.""The BCCI's all-important meeting with the franchises to decide on the retention rules will be held soon, he said. TOI has learnt that some franchises are in favour of a s many as eight retentions, while some want none. He also clarified that there have been no discussions on reviving the Champions League T20 tournament, contrary to recent claims made by an official from Cricket Victoria in Mumbai.Shah revealed that the BCCI had taken up the issue of holding the 2027 World Test Championship (WTC) final outside of England with the ICC. The first two WTC finals were held in the UK, while the third one too will be held there - at the Lord's Cricket Ground in 2025.""We have spoken about the ICC for 2027. There are only three main Test centres - India, England, and Australia. You cannot hold it in Australia during that window or even in India,"" he said.There is speculation that Shah will be taking up the position of International Cricket Council (ICC) chairman in November, as Greg Barclay's term ends later this year, but the BCCI secretary didn't reveal his cards. ""Let there be speculation. But let me be here (in the BCCI). Am I not doing a good job?"" he said in jest.Shah said that there will be no increase in the remuneration for domestic players.

While Virat has a hundred and 37 fifties to his name, Babar has 3 centuries and 35 half-centuries to his credit.Both Virat and Babar have a top score of 122 in T20Is though the former Indian captain's effort was an unbeaten one.While Virat has scored 4037 T20I runs, leading the most runs chart, Babar is yet to breach the 4000-run mark with 3880 runs under his belt.Rohit Sharma (34), Mohammad Rizwan (27) and David Warner (27) are the next three in the list of most fifty-plus scores in T20Is.Comparisons between Virat Kohli and Babar Azam have been constant for quite a while now.Kohli is known for his consistency across all formats of the game. He has a remarkable record in both Test and limited-overs cricket , with numerous centuries to his name.

NEW DELHI: Captain Shubman Gill blasted a scorching century, while B Sai Sudharsan notched his first IPL century, helping the Gujarat Titans stay in the playoff race with a 35-run victory over the Chennai Super Kings on Friday.Sudharsan (103 off 51 balls) and skipper Gill (104 off 55 deliveries) matched each other stroke for stroke, producing destructive centuries to guide GT to 231/3.The home team's bowlers then restricted the defending champions to 196/8 despite valiant fifties from Daryl Mitchell (63) and Moeen Ali (56).After being sent in to bat, Gill and Sudharsan put on a display of six-hitting, building a 210-run partnership, the highest stand for any wicket in the IPL this season.The two also equalled Quinton de Kock and KL Rahul's highest-ever IPL opening partnership.While Gill's remarkable innings was punctuated by nine fours and six maximums, Sudharsan's maiden IPL hundred was peppered with five boundaries and seven sixes.In contrast, the CSK openers were back in the hut with just two runs on the board. Their best batter this season, skipper Rituraj Gaikwad (0) was also sent packing with Rashid Khan completing a brilliant catch on the boundary with the defending champions reeling at 10/3.Mitchell and Moeen steadied the ship with some counter attacking play, stitching a 109-run partnership. The two targeted the Afghan spin duo of Rashid and Noor Ahmad.While Moeen clobbered three sixes on the trot off Noor in the 11th over, Mitchel hit a boundary and a six in the next over off Rashid to bring down the equation to 113 runs off the last 48 balls.But veteran Mohit Sharma (3/31) struck off his very first ball, dismissing Mitchell and then came back to take the scalps of Moeen and Shivam Dube (21).Rashid soon joined the party, getting rid of Ravindra Jadeja (18) and Mitchell Santner (0).Mahendra Singh Dhoni (26 not out) got the fans excited with three sixes, including back-to-back maximums in the last over but it was in a lost cause.The win lifted GT from the bottom of the table to the eighth spot. They have 10 points from 12 games.While CSK remain on fourth with 12 points, their net run rate took a hit, dropping from +0.700 to +0.491.Earlier invited to bat first, Gill timed to perfection an over pitched Santner delivery for GT's first boundary of the innings. He then lofted the ball over mid on for a maximum, setting the tone of the game.Gill's lazy elegance was on full display as he hit an effortless six off a Simarjeet Singh delivery over long on into the stands in the sixth over.At the other end, after a relatively slow start, Sudarsan, who was elevated to the role of an opener, too accelerated. He went down on his knees to hit a slog sweep off star spinner Ravindra Jadeja to get his fifty in 32-balls.A couple of overs later, Gill too reached his half-century with a top edge that went the distance.The CSK bowlers, barring Shardul Thakur (0/25), who was the most economical, could do little to stop the onslaught by Gill and Sudharsan.CSK's effort in the field was also found wanting, besides general sloppiness, the defending champions, dropped Gill at the boundary.Tushar Deshpande (2/33) misjudged a miss-hit by Gill and dropped the GT skipper on 72. To add salt to the wounds, not only the dropped catch went for a six, the Daryl Mitchell over yielded 19 runs.Gill soon brought up his fourth IPL hundred by sending a Simarjeet full toss through square leg for four. It was the 100th ton in the history of the IPL and the youngster celebrated rather animatedly.Sudharsan followed his skipper as he sent a length ball soaring over the fence to bring up his first-ever IPL hundred in style.CSK bowlers then managed to stage a comeback as they gave just 41 runs in the last five overs. Deshpande picked up the wickets of Sudharsan and Gill.",Gujarat Titans beat Chennai Super Kings by 35 runs. Captain Shubman Gill scores 104 not out. B Sai Sudharsan scores first IPL century. Daryl Mitchell and Moeen Ali score fifties for CSK.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110018972,imgsize-61564,width-400,resizemode-4/110018972.jpg"

Virat Kohli once again became the centre of attraction with his all-round show during Royal Challengers Bengaluru 's (RCB) win over Punjab Kings in their IPL match on Thursday in Dharamsala. First, he dazzled with the bat and then produced a moment of brilliance in the field to grab everybody's attention.Kohli lived a charmed life with the bat during the initial part of his innings, when he was dropped on 0 and 10 by Punjab Kings.But he made the most of those chances and made the opposition pay a heavy price as the RCB icon when on to score 92 off just 47 balls.In the field, Kohli produced a 'Superman' effort by effecting a run-out with a direct hit while running in from the boundary to dismiss Punjab's last hope Shashank Singh, who scored a brisk 37 off only 19 balls.Chasing RCB's gigantic 241 for 7, Punjab were bowled out for 181 and lost by a massive 60 runs.While the win kept RCB alive in the race to playoffs, Kohli's all-round show became the talk of the town. The Orange Cap holder has now scored 634 runs in 12 innings and has become only the second batter after KL Rahul to score 600-plus runs in a season four times in the IPL.Reflecting on how Kohli goes about his business to excel in every skill he posseses, his India teammate and fast bowler Mohammed Shami said it doesn't matter to Kohli if he is coming from a long break. He just stays focused all the time and wants to leave an impression with everything he does.""Woh ek aisa banda hai jo kahin bhi rahe woh apne frame (zone) mei rehta zaroor hai. Woh jab bhi aayega, woh show karega apne aap ko ke haan 'mai kya hu' (he is such a person who stays focused wherever he is. Whenever he returns, he shows who he is),"" said Shami on a Cricbuzz show.Kohli took a long break for the birth of his son and missed the five-Test home series against England before the start of the IPL.""He keeps his plans very clear, be it fitness, batting. Even if you give him the bowling, he will do the job, even with his cross feet (wrong foot) action,"" said Shami with a smile.""If there are such role models for today's generation, imagine how much they will get to learn -- fitness, skill and so on. Every aspect you look at, you find loyalty for everything. That reflects in Virat Kohli.""",Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Punjab Kings by 60 runs in IPL match.

Jay Shah reveals who made the decision to exclude Ishan Kishan and Shreyas Iyer from central contracts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/jay-shah-reveals-who-made-the-decision-to-exclude-ishan-kishan-and-shreyas-iyer-from-central-contracts/articleshow/110004249.cms,"(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: The decision to remove Ishan Kishan and Shreyas Iyer from the list of players under central contract was made only by Ajit Agarkar , the chairman of selectors, BCCI secretary Jay Shah disclosed, stating that ""nobody is indispensable"".After neglecting to appear for domestic engagements in spite of a BCCI mandate, Kishan and Iyer were excluded.Iyer did play for Mumbai in a couple of Ranji Trophy matches, including the semifinal and final, but Kishan took a lengthy vacation following the conclusion of the ODI World Cup and did not return until the IPL Iyer was still on the receiving end, though, when it came to light that he had gone to a Kolkata Knight Riders camp in Mumbai when his statemates were occupied with a Ranji Trophy match.""You can check the constitution. I am just a convener (of the selection meeting),"" he said during a media interaction at the BCCI head office here on Thursday.""That decision lies with Ajit Agarkar, even when these two players (Ishan Kishan and Shreyas Iyer) who did not play domestic (cricket), the decision to drop them (from the central contracts list) was only his.""My role is just to implement. And we have got new players (in place), like Sanju (Samson). Nobody is indispensable,"" he added.Shah restated the Board's stance, according to which Indian players must give priority to playing domestic cricket.Before the third Test match between India and England in February of this year, Shah had declared in the days preceding the contract rejection that he would fully support the chief selector's decision to take any action against players who do not adhere to the Indian captain and team management's requirements for participation in domestic cricket.Following their expulsion, Shah claimed to have spoken with the players.""Yes, I had spoken with them. Media had even carried the reports,"" he said.""Even Hardik (Pandya) said if BCCI is considering me for white-ball, then I am ready to play Vijay Hazare Trophy and Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. Any player will have to play, even if they do not want to, they will have to,"" Shah continued.Shah stated that, in the end, it boils down to who is playing well and who can maintain performance as a player when discussing high scores in this year's IPL.""Whoever plays well in the IPL... like say Ishan Kishan, he finds it difficult to take part with the Indian team but he can play in Mumbai Indians as a player. There he can play in a relaxed manner.""In Team India , you have to prove yourself, give back to back performances. The one who can handle that can be described as a right player,"" he added.Shah also shared information on his chat with Kishan, which happened following the Mumbai Indians' game against the Gujarat Titans.""No, I did not advise him anything. It was just a friendly talk that he should do well and I speak with all players like that,"" he said.While there have been a few media reports mentioning an increase in the match fees for domestic players in the country, Shah said there is no such plan.""We have increased the pay anyway and also incentivised Test cricket. We had increased the pay by 100 per cent in 2022,"" Shah added.",Ishan Kishan and Shreyas Iyer were excluded from central contracts list. BCCI secretary Jay Shah said the decision was made by chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar. Shah also revealed that Hardik Pandya is ready to play white-ball matches.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110004181,imgsize-62420,width-400,resizemode-4/110004181.jpg"

In short:

How we calculate the chances

With 12 games left to be played in the league stage of IPL 2024, there remain nearly 4,100 possible combinations of match results. No one is yet certain of making the playoffs , but two teams ( MI and PBKS) are totally ruled out.We look at the chances of each team:The team currently topping the table have a 36% chance of finishing the sole toppers and they could do that even with just one win from their remaining three games.Their chances of finishing joint toppers on points are an impressive 62.5%. Yet, they are still not sure of making the playoffs. If they lose all their remaining games, they could end up tied fourth with DC or LSG depending on results in other games. But there's just a 0.4% chance of such a scenario.Like KKR, they have a 36% chance of being sole toppers at the end of the league phase and a 62.5% chance of being at least tied for the first spot on points. Yet, they too are still not sure of making the playoffs. If they lose all their remaining games, they could end up tied fourth with DC or LSG depending on results in other games. But again, there's just a 0.4% chance of such a scenario.Currently in third place, SRH have nearly 94% chance of finishing among the top four in terms of points. The best they can hope for is a joint first spot with one to three other teams and the chances of that are a little under 5%.Fourth-placed CSK have a little over 73% chance of finishing within the top four slots either singly or jointly. Like SRH, the best they can do is tied for top spot with one to three other teams. And the chances of that are a mere 4%.Lying in fifth place at the moment, DC have no chance of finishing the toppers or even joint toppers. Their chances of ending up among the top four singly or jointly are just under 50%. Their best case scenario is joint second on points and there's a little under 4% chance of that happening.At the moment in sixth place, LSG's chances of making the top four singly or jointly are just under 50%. Like DC, the best they can do is tie for the second spot with one to three other teams. The chances of that happening are just under 4%.Despite Thursday's win, RCB remain in seventh place and the best they can hope for is tied third or fourth. The win, however, upped the chances of that from around 8% to over 16%.The 2022 title holders find themselves at the bottom of the table and their chances of progressing are slim at a little under 8%.Thursday's loss to RCB has effectively ended Punjab's 2024 campaign as they can no longer make it to the last four. Even the chances of a joint fifth spot are a lowly 0.3%.MI were already out of the playoffs. They too can at best end up joint 5th and even that is just a 0.6% chance.Bet on KKR and RR making the playoffs to be joined by two out of CSK, SRH, LSG and DC, with the first two having a distinctly better chance. For RCB or GT to get into the mix would need much to go their way.With 12 games remaining, there remain 4,096 possible combinations of match outcomes. We look at each one of those and what it would mean in terms of the final rankings of the teams. Then we work out the percentage of outcomes that would give team ""A"" a chance of finishing in the top four, or the first spot and so on. The underlying assumption is that any given match is a 50-50 game, not unreasonable given how the IPL has unfolded this year and in other years. For instance, of the 4,096 combinations, SRH finish among the top four slots singly or jointly in 3,840 combinations, which means a 93.8% chance of making the top four spots singly or jointly.","With 12 games remaining, there remain 4,096 possible combinations of match outcomes.

Virat Kohli always wants to be in the thick of things when it comes to action on the cricket field, and Thursday was no different. First he played a sensational innings and then produced a 'Superman' moment on the field with a run-out off a direct hit in Royal Challengers Bengaluru's (RCB) big win over Punjab Kings at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala .Coming out to bat in his customary opening position for RCB, Kohli's bat sparkled to produced 92 runs off just 47 balls, including 6 sixes and 7 fours, which powered RCB to a mammoth 241 for 7, as Rajat Patidar (55 off 23 balls) and Cameron Green (46 off 27 balls) kept the momentum in the middle overs and towards the end.Kohli, however, had a lucky day on the crease as he was dropped twice -- on 0 and 10.Orange Cap-holder Kohli now has 634 runs in 12 innings, becoming only the second batsman after KL Rahul to score 600-plus runs in four IPL seasons.For Punjab, Harshal Patel led the bowling charts with his spell of 3/38, which also earned him the Purple Cap. His tally of wickets now tops the charts with 20 wickets in 12 innings.Punjab's run-chase folded up in 17 overs at 181 all out despite Rilee Rossouw's commendable knock of 61 off just 27 balls. The RCB bowling effort was led by Mohammed Siraj's 3 for 43. Swapnil Singh, Lockie Ferguson and Karn Sharma took two wickets each.The chase also saw a moment of brilliance in the field by Kohli when he ran out Shashank Singh , who scored a pacy 37 off just 19 balls.The delivery after Shashank's nasty collision with RCB skipper Faf du Plessis in the 14th over, the Punjab batsman played Lockie Ferguson towards the leg-side and tried to steal a second run as Kohli ran in from deep mid-wicket, picked up the ball one-handed and threw the stumps down in the same motion with a direct hit to celebrate straight away.The third-umpire found Shashank's bat short of the popping crase on replay and declared the batsman out.It was RCB's fourth straight win and fifth in total, which took them to 10 points and kept their faint playoff hopes alive.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Punjab Kings by five wickets in IPL.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming has shed light on the team's approach towards managing the fitness of former skipper MS Dhoni in the lead-up to their upcoming encounter against Gujarat Titans in the ongoing Indian Premier League 2024.Addressing concerns over Dhoni's physical condition, Fleming emphasized the cautious stance adopted by the team management, acknowledging the immense value Dhoni brings to the squad.Despite Dhoni's lower position in the batting order, Fleming urged against underestimating his impact, citing his proficiency in scoring boundaries and his prowess behind the stumps.""Like just hitting sixes and fours, which he has done pretty well. And keep as well as some of the best in the competition if not the best in the competition. So don't underestimate his influence on the team just because he comes in at No. 9.

's slip was reminiscent of Kahn's butterfingers in 2002 WC final

Goalkeeping howlers, as they say, are part of the game but some stay entrenched in minds much longer after the final whistle has been blown.Magnificent till the 87th minute in the Champions League semifinal's deciding tie against Real Madrid on Wednesday night, Bayern's Manuel Neuer will have nightmares about what happened in the 88th.Even Neuer spills. Even Homer nods.As Neuer stood aghast, from the flash drive of memory popped up a hoary, time-worn visual of Oliver Kahn 's slip from grace. In that gentrified June evening at Yokohama, 22 summers ago, Neuer's illustrious predecessor made a similar faux pas. The eventual Golden Ball winner, the only goalkeeper to win the award in the history of the World Cup, spilled a stinger from Brazil's Rivaldo. Ronaldo, sniffing around like a terrier, did the rest.Kahn's momentary loss of brilliance lost Germany the World Cup.On Wednesday night, Neuer's frozen fingers allowed unheralded Joselu to score and open the gates for Carlo Ancelotti's unrelenting Real Madrid to sneak through to the Champions League final at Wembley.""Anyone who's ever played football knows how I'm feeling right now. That we've been knocked out in the closing stages, having led 1-0 until the (88th minute), it's extremely bitter. We had taken one step to London, we saw ourselves in the final and now I'm lost for words,"" Neuer told the media after his disastrous moment in Madrid.Till that moment, Neuer remained impregnable under the bar. He remained the only reason the radioactive Vinicius Junior failed to get on the scoresheet. A back-to-back save to deny Real Madrid was the standout moment that enhanced Neuer's reputation of being the big game performer, the big brother of custodians, one who could slap a ball off an attacker's head inside his own box in a World Cup final and carry on as if it's just another day in office.Those who were fortunate enough to watch him at the Maracana would never forget a goalkeeper's supreme nonchalance.When he acrobatically palmed Vinicius' vicious punch over the bar, no one missed a beat because it was 'Manu the wall', as the Bayern fans have been fondly calling him for the last 13 seasons.""Manu did incredibly well but then made a mistake he wouldn't have made for 100 years,"" said Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel . ""It's frustrating. If there's anyone who didn't deserve that, it's Manu. We know who he is, what he's achieved.""At 38, Neuer made everyone believe in his stupendous shot-stopping ability and feline reflexes when his slightest touch defied Vinicius and when the ball bounced off the post, he was ready to deny Rodrygo. The reason Bayern could make the tie so close was Neuer and Neuer alone. Even legends do have a fall and Neuer relived the Kahn emotions and surely the senior felt the same.Wednesday's loss meant Neuer and Bayern will finish the season without a trophy for the first time since 2012.",Manuel Neuer's slip was reminiscent of Oliver Kahn's butterfingers in 2002 WC final.

History-makers Olympiakos to face Fiorentina in Europa Conference League final,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/history-makers-olympiakos-to-face-fiorentina-in-europa-conference-league-final/articleshow/109994786.cms,"(With AFP inputs)

Olympiakos secured their place in the Europa Conference League final by defeating Aston Villa 2-0 in the second leg of the semi-finals, marking a historic moment for the club. Led by Jose Luis Mendilibar, Olympiakos sealed a commanding 6-2 aggregate victory, largely thanks to Ayoub El Kaabi's brace, who had also scored a hat-trick in the first leg.The atmosphere at the Karaiskakis Stadium in Piraeus was electrifying as Olympiakos, boasting a record 47 Greek championships, earned their debut in a major European final.This achievement places them alongside Panathinaikos as the only Greek clubs to reach such heights, with Panathinaikos falling to Ajax in the 1971 European Cup final.The upcoming final against Fiorentina at the AEK Arena adds to the sense of destiny for Olympiakos, as it lies just 10 miles away from their home ground, further emphasizing the local rivalry.Despite Mendilibar's recent appointment in February, he has quickly become an iconic figure for Olympiakos, turning around their European fortunes after several disappointments in previous seasons.Under the ownership of Evangelos Marinakis, Olympiakos had struggled in Europe, failing to progress past the group stage 14 times out of 16 attempts. However, this season presents an opportunity for redemption, with Olympiakos aiming to secure their first European trophy in their nearly century-long history, a feat that would rival Greece's memorable Euro 2004 triumph.It has been a remarkable year for Olympiakos, highlighted by their Under-19 team's success in the UEFA Youth League final against AC Milan in April.On the other hand, Fiorentina booked their spot in the final by overcoming Club Brugge in the semi-finals, setting the stage for a thrilling showdown.Villa's departure marked a painful end to their quest for their first European final appearance since 1982. After returning to European competition following a 13-year hiatus, Villa now face the challenge of regrouping and redirecting their focus towards securing a top-four finish in the Premier League to qualify for the next season's Champions League.Under the guidance of Unai Emery, currently occupying fourth place in the league standings, Villa hold a seven-point lead over Tottenham, who sit in fifth place with three games remaining, compared to Villa's two.Early in the match, Olympiakos's Chiquinho had a chance on goal after bypassing Villa's defense, but his shot missed the target. However, Villa failed to take heed of this warning as Olympiakos capitalized on their defensive lapses to take the lead in the 10th minute.Despite Villa's attempts to find their rhythm, they struggled to coordinate their efforts, exemplified by Leon Bailey's slip as he attempted a shot that posed little threat to Olympiakos goalkeeper Kostas Tzolakis, who showcased his skill with a remarkable save to deny Bailey's powerful strike just before halftime.With Olympiakos firmly in control of the match, they pressed relentlessly and defended resolutely to keep Villa at bay. In the 78th minute, Ayoub El Kaabi sealed the result for Olympiakos, capitalizing on Tzolakis's clearance to score, securing their victory and igniting celebrations among the Olympiakos faithful.",Olympiakos defeated Aston Villa 2-0 in the second leg of the semi-finals. Ayoub El Kaabi scored a brace to seal a 6-2 aggregate victory.

NEW DELHI: Real Madrid showcased their renowned comeback prowess to secure a dramatic 2-1 second-leg victory over Bayern Munich at the Santiago Bernabeu , sealing their path to the Champions League final .Trailing behind on aggregate, Real faced the prospect of elimination as Bayern substitute Alphonso Davies unleashed a stunning strike in the 68th minute.However, a late surge from Real, orchestrated by substitute Joselu, turned the tide of the match.Joselu's equalizer in the 88th minute, capitalizing on a rare error from Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer , injected new life into the Bernabeu. Moments later, he secured the win with a second goal, albeit controversially initially ruled out for offside before being awarded following a VAR review .Reflecting on the team's indomitable spirit, midfielder Jude Bellingham remarked, ""We've seen it a lot of times this season when it looked as though we're dead and buried ... it doesn’t matter who scores the goals but someone always manages it... that mentality of never say die.""Real Madrid's dominance throughout the game was evident, with Vinicius Jr leading the charge down the left channel and Neuer putting up a valiant defense for Bayern. Despite Bayern's resilient performance, Real's relentless pressure eventually paid off, propelling them to yet another Champions League final.Bayern Munich, meanwhile, felt aggrieved by what they perceived as contentious officiating decisions, particularly a disallowed goal in added time. Defender Matthijs De Ligt expressed frustration, labeling the call ""a disgraceful decision.""With their Bundesliga reign ended by Bayer Leverkusen, Bayern's hopes for silverware were dashed, leaving them with only the Champions League to fight for this season. Manager Thomas Tuchel lamented the outcome, describing it as feeling ""like a betrayal in the end.""Real Madrid's remarkable comeback sets the stage for an electrifying final showdown against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley on June 1, as they aim to clinch a record-extending 15th Champions League title.",Real Madrid beat Bayern Munich 2-1 on aggregate to reach Champions League final.

Kylian Mbappe: Kylian Mbappe's final match for Paris Saint-Germain ends in Champions League semi-final defeat to Borussia Dortmund,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/champions-league/top-stories/kylian-mbappes-final-match-for-paris-saint-germain-ends-in-champions-league-semi-final-defeat-to-borussia-dortmund/articleshow/109933341.cms,"NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe 's dream of bidding farewell to Paris Saint-Germain by leading them to their first-ever Champions League title has been shattered following their unexpected semi-final defeat to Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday. The 2018 World Cup winner, who is set to leave PSG when his contract expires at the end of the season, likely to join Real Madrid , had hoped to sign off by guiding the club to European glory at Wembley next month.Despite PSG's status as favourites and their 31 attempts on goal, they failed to overturn a one-goal first-leg deficit, with Mats Hummels scoring the only goal of the night to secure a 2-0 aggregate victory for Dortmund. Mbappe, one of four PSG players to hit the woodwork in the second half, admitted that they needed to be more clinical in front of goal.""I don't really like to talk about bad luck. When you are good, you don't hit the post, you score. I tried to help the best I could. When I say we needed to be more clinical, I am the one who has to be scoring. But this is life, we need to pick ourselves up,"" Mbappe said after the loss.The defeat marks the closest Mbappe has come to lifting the European Cup with his hometown team, for whom he is their all-time top scorer with 255 goals, including 42 in the Champions League. The French sports daily L'Equipe described the result as ""the end of his dream"" and gave a scathing assessment of Mbappe's performance, rating him just two out of 10.PSG's elimination by a team sitting fifth in the Bundesliga is seen as a significant disappointment for a club that has invested heavily since the Qatari takeover in 2011. It is the latest in a series of Champions League knockout round failures, with their 6-1 defeat by Barcelona in 2017 still the most notable.Despite the presence of Mbappe, this PSG side was not seriously expected to reach this stage of the competition, having undergone a major overhaul following the departures of Lionel Messi and Neymar. Coach Luis Enrique, brought in to oversee the new project, acknowledged that his objective was to compete as well as possible for every trophy. Mbappe's final game for the club will now be the French Cup final against Lyon on May 25.The lack of experience at this level may have ultimately cost PSG, with their starting line-up having an average age of just 24 years and 157 days, the youngest for any team in a Champions League semi-final since Arsenal faced Manchester United in 2009. Captain Marquinhos emphasized the need to focus on the positives, saying, ""We need to remember that it is a new project with a new coach, with lots of changes. There are lots of positives and good things to take forward into next season.""However, it remains to be seen how PSG can improve their chances of winning the Champions League without Mbappe, even with the likely significant investment in a replacement.The coach's strategy of resting Mbappe or substituting him in domestic league games over the past three months, apparently in preparation for next season, has not ultimately helped PSG secure the trophy they most desire. As Mbappe, now 25, prepares to leave Paris, he will hope to finally get his hands on the Champions League trophy with his next club.",Kylian Mbappe is set to leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season. PSG lost 2-0 on aggregate to Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League semi-final. The defeat is seen as a significant disappointment for the French club.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109934269,imgsize-61554,width-400,resizemode-4/109934269.jpg"
Parthib Gogoi a step away from achieving his dream,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/parthib-gogoi-a-step-away-from-achieving-his-dream/articleshow/109926682.cms,"KOLKATA: “Every young footballer dreams of playing for India,” was how Parthib Gogoi — named for the first time by Igor Stimac among the probables for the crucial World Cup qualifiers — put it when asked about his national team aspirations.“Playing for India is always a different kind of feeling. All of us have a lot of passion for playing in national colours.There is this feeling that we will give our lives to win the game for India. So that’s the feeling I get and get connected emotionally when representing India.”While the 21-year-old has chosen to stay low before the final squad selection, the Assam footballer is one of the new faces that head coach Stimac chose to give a shot ahead of India’s vital June fixtures in quest to progress to the third round of World Cup qualifiers. He will join NEUFC teammate and fellow first-time India probable Jithin MS for the four-week camp in Bhubaneswar set to begin this week.And if NEUFC’s only player to score in four consecutive games for his club makes it into Stimac’s final squad, it will be a milestone in Gogoi’s journey from his father’s football training centre in Assam’s Sivasagar to donning the jersey for the senior national team.“My idol is Sunil Chhetri . And if I get to share the dressing room with him, I can learn so much from him. If young players get a chance in the Indian squad, we can learn so much from the senior players. But it depends on the coach. If he picks me, I will give my best,” Parthib said during a freewheeling interaction with TOI.Parthib, along with Jithin this season, has been a bright spot in the Highlanders’ last two Indian Super League campaigns and has been getting better with time and experience. He had eight shots on target, of which three were goals, in 18 appearances in 2022-23 and continued the form at Durand Cup this year with his first hat-trick for NEUFC.Having extended his NEUFC contract till 2026-27, Parthib scored five goals for his team this ISL season while also providing two assists. But what captivated fans are three spectacular strikes from long range – against title winners Mumbai City, Chennaiyin and East Bengal.Parthib expressed his love for such piledrivers during the interaction. “That’s something I really love to do. Even while playing FIFA on Playstation, I always look for opportunities to shoot from distance,” he said.Having started his football journey as a two-year-old by following his brother Pragyan – also his teammate and “mental support” at NEUFC – to the field, Parthib has had the support of his entire family in his pursuit.“My father and his colleagues started a football training centre in 2005 that trains kids even today. My brother used to go there for training from 2005. My father, who was not a footballer but loves the game, used to carry me to the ground when I was two to watch my brother play and if I liked it, I could play it too. So that's how my football journey started in 2007. Also, papa used to get football clips on his phone, like those of Messi or Ronaldo, for us and watching these clips, I got attracted to the game,” Parthib said before adding with a laugh, “I have broken many doors in my house.”Having climbed through the ranks of Assam age-group teams, Bengaluru’s Ozone Football Academy and Indian Arrows, Parthib has also represented India at age-group competitions, the most recent being U23 AFC Cup Qualifiers in China followed by friendlies in Indonesia.But the bigger test begins for him this week as he looks to grab a place in Stimac’s scheme of things and add a goalscoring touch to the squad against Kuwait and Qatar.Asked about his future goal, the Messi fan and self-proclaimed “Barcelona boy” said, “I want to become one of the best footballers in India.”The dream bodes well for India, too, with the team in dire need of goal scorers as Chhetri approaches his twilight days with the team.",Parthib Gogoi named among probables for India's World Cup qualifiers.

NEW DELHI: Michael Olise 's two goals propelled Crystal Palace to a resounding 4-0 triumph over Manchester United at Selhurst Park on Monday, marking the first time in their history that Palace have secured a league double over the Red Devils.

Their chances of securing European football for the upcoming season are rapidly diminishing. Palace, on the other hand, sit in 14th place with 43 points from 36 matches.United's injury woes were compounded by the absence of Bruno Fernandes, who missed a match due to injury for the first time in his 230-game Old Trafford career. The ease with which they were defeated will be a significant concern for everyone associated with the club.This marks the first instance in the Premier League era that United have suffered 13 defeats in a single season, and the scoreline could have been even more lopsided.Under the guidance of new manager Oliver Glasner, Palace have found their rhythm, while United are stumbling towards the end of a season that cannot conclude soon enough for Ten Hag.","Crystal Palace defeated Manchester United 4-0 at Selhurst Park on Monday.
