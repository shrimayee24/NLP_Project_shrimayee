After leading India to victory in the T20 World Cup earlier this year, Rohit Sharma decided to quit the format in the international arena, while many felt he is still fit enough to play both the white-ball formats besides Test cricket .India defeated South Africa in a thrilling final to become the T20 world champions once again in June this year. Soon after the triumph in Barbados, both Rohit and Virat Kohli announced their retirement from T20Is .In a recent podcast, Rohit, who was also part of MS Dhoni's team that won the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007, shed light on the reasons why he felt it was time for him to bid T20Is adieu.'The only reason I retired from T20Is is because I have had my time, I enjoyed playing the format, I played for 17 years, I did well and all of that,"" said Rohit. ""Then, you won the (2024) World Cup. This was the best time for me to decide that 'okay, this is now time for me to move on and look after the other things'. There are a lot of good players who can do well for India.""""It (decision to quit T20Is) was not because I felt anything. I just felt this was the right time. I could still play all three formats easily. That's why I say fitness is in your mind, how you train your mind.""""I believe everything is in the mind. I am a person who has got a lot of self-belief because I know that I can control my mind when I have to. Sometimes it's not easy. I know most of the time I can do that. If you tell your body that you are young, you can do this, you can do that, (then) of course you can,"" Rohit added.Rohit played 159 T20Is and ended up with 4231 runs at an average of 31.34 and strike rate of 140.89, including 5 hundreds and 32 fifties.After Rohit quit T20Is, the BCCI appointed Suryakumar Yadav in the role.",Rohit played 159 T20Is and ended up with 4231 runs at an average of 31.34 and strike rate of 140.89.

NEW DELHI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) on Saturday announced new retention rules for the IPL 2025 season, which included a notable change for uncapped players .The rule change has sparked debate over Dhoni's future in the IPL, as many fans speculate if the 2024 season was truly his last.Amid the chatter around the uncapped player rule, Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan 's recent comments about Dhoni have now gone viral.At the recent IIFA award ceremony, Shah Rukh was asked about retirement by his longtime friend and filmmaker, Karan Johar , leading to a hilarious exchange.During the event, Karan teased Shah Rukh when the latter said, ""Legends know when to retire."" He also cited the examples like Sachin Tendulkar, Sunil Chhetri, and Roger Federer.Replying to that, Karan quipped, ""So, by that standard, why don't you retire?""In classic SRK fashion, he responded with quick wit, ""Actually mai doosre kisam ka legendary hoon. Mai aur Dhoni ek kisam ke legends hai. Na na kar ke bhi 10 aur IPL seasons khel jaate hai (Actually, I‚Äôm a different kind of legend. Dhoni and I belong to the same league.

Things in Pakistan cricket took a turn for the worse on Saturday when one of the national selectors, Mohammad Yousuf, resigned from his position following continued criticism since the team's failure in the T20 World Cup and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) overlooking consistent performers in domestic cricket. The effects of that were clearly felt in batsman Iftikhar Ahmed 's press conference following the Champions Cup final.Markhors ' skipper, Iftikhar, was visibly upset after his team's defeat by Panthers and vented out at a reporter over a question on the young talent emerging from the Champions Cup.When asked which young players, according to him, the tournament has unveiled, Iftikhar blamed the media for unnecessary hype.""Media ne kya dekh liya hai (what has the media observed)?"" he shot back at the reporter.""See, I am not against anyone, but I tell you people, the media, that don't hype someone so much after just one innings, like we have got this and that talent. Let them (youngsters) perform in domestic cricket. Let them succeed there 2-3 seasons, then talk about their prospects to play for Pakistan,"" he said without taking any names.""Ek innings mei aap upar le ke jaate, fir wahan pe jab woh Pakistan ke liye fail ho jata hai, toh kehte ho 'yeh kahan se laye ho, yeh toh kuchh bhi nahi hai' (media puts a batsman on cloud nine after just one innings and when that batsman fails while playing for Pakistan, you guys say 'where has this come from, it's nothing'),"" said Iftikhar.However, former Pakistan players like Ahmed Shehzad have been continuously criticising the PCB for not giving young talent a chance and keeping inconsistent performers in the team for longer than they deserve.But Iftikhar reiterated that youngsters should be considered for Pakistan only after they have succeeded in domestic cricket for a couple of seasons and not just after one good innings.""For god sake, let a player succeed in all formats in domestic cricket, then talk about him. You guys talk so much, like 'Pakistan has got another Inzamam'...I am not against anyone. I am telling everyone to give domestic cricket its due respect. Let a player succeed there in all formats. Then let's all of us talk about that player,"" said the 34-year-old all-rounder who has played 4 Tests, 28 ODIs and 66 T20Is.He went on to blame the media for spoiling the cricket atmosphere in the country.""Aap logon ki wajah se cricket ka jo sara mahaul hai woh kharab ho gaya hai (things in Pakistan cricket have gone bad because of you guys).

Mayank Yadav

Speaks To TOI About India Call-Up, Injury Which Is Common Among Javelin Throwers And How

Sonnet Club

Took Care Of All Of His Needs‚Ä¶

A lot is said about your pace‚Ä¶

Your injury and rehab at NCA‚Ä¶

You are very attached to Sonnet Club‚Ä¶

Could you elaborate on how Sonnet helped you?

You have already worked with Gautam Gambhir and Morne Morkel at LSG‚Ä¶

KANPUR: Mayank Yadav was having his dinner at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) when he learnt the selectors had picked him for the T20I series against Bangladesh. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt aware of the selection.But I saw my mates here receiving congratulatory calls. I just checked the BCCI website and got to know my name was there,‚Äù Mayank told TOI.He rang up his mother, spoke to her about six minutes before she got emotional and tears started rolling down her cheeks. ‚ÄúOnce I put down the phone, I had flashbacks in front of my eyes‚Äîfrom the day I first went to Sonnet Club to the four anxious months spent at the NCA to recover from frequent niggles,‚Äù he said of his first reaction.Mayank is just 22 and he has only played one first-class match, 17 List A matches and 14 T20s for Delhi before the four exciting IPL matches for LSG this year. That‚Äôs not a lot to go by before being picked for India. It‚Äôs his electric pace which easily breaches the 150 kmph mark on the speed gun that stood out.Excerpts from a conversation:I was not aware I could bowl this quick. I always thought I bowled at a pace which is normal for anybody. Devender Sharma sir (coach at Sonnet) and people in Delhi cricket would tell me I am bowling 150 kmph but I never believed them. In my first session at LSG in 2022, I bowled for a while. The support staff asked me to guess the speed of my deliveries. I said 140 kmph since I felt I bowled in a good rhythm. But then they told me I was bowling 149 and 150 kmph throughout. That‚Äôs when I realized I could bowl really quick.‚ÄùWhen I was with LSG, I went to Dr. Dinshaw Pardiwala (one who treated Rishabh Pant and looks after India‚Äôs Olympians). He told me my side strain is not a regular one. It happens to athletes in high-intensity sports like javelin or there must have been a major impact with an object. When I went to NCA after IPL, it was found that I was not taking enough protein. Since I am a strict vegetarian, I had to be given supplements. I had other niggles when I was about to get fit. It was agonizing but people at NCA like Troy Cooley and my trainer Rajnikanth were helpful. I can tell you that I understand my body now.When I went for a trial for a summer camp there as a 14-year-old, I got picked immediately. But the fee was around Rs 35 thousand. My father had a very small business and could not afford that amount. But Devender sir and late Tarak Sinha sir immediately waived the fee for me. They said they would take care of me then on. My father never spoke to me about cricket since. Even yesterday, he didn‚Äôt speak to me. Sonnet is special to me. Even at NCA, I met Rishabh (Pant) bhaiya. He was helpful and talked so much about how the club is doing. That‚Äôs what Sonnet does to its players.I could never afford bowling shoes. Tarak sir and Devender sir once noticed it. They gave me the money to buy my shoes as per my wish. I never thought I was any special bowler. Once during a camp in Jaipur just before Covid lockdown, I was hiding in a group of players. Tarak sir told everyone at the ground: ‚ÄúThere is a bowler here who is really special. He will be in Delhi‚Äôs Ranji probables in no time and will be playing for India in four years and that is Mayank Yadav.‚Äù From then I never had issues with my confidence. I was 15 when Devender sir made me play in a semifinal of a senior tournament. I got four wickets there. I had issues with my line and length but they kept giving me matches till I got consistent.Gautam bhaiya had once told me that there will be players who get multiple chances to prove themselves and there will be some who will get just one opportunity. I was struggling to even find a sponsor for my shoe despite being in an IPL team and having played for Delhi. Gautam bhaiya‚Äôs words stayed with me. He and Vijay Dahiya (former coach at LSG) had clearly told me that I would get my first game after one or two years. When the opportunity came this year, I had to make it count. The day after my IPL debut, I got offers for my bowling shoes. As far as Morne is concerned, he doesn‚Äôt speak much. If he observes anything then he will come and point it out. He will mostly talk about strategies.","Mayank Yadav was picked for the T20I series against Bangladesh.

NEW DELHI: Virender Sehwag 's 309 in Multan, often referred to as the ""Sultan of Multan"" innings, is one of the most iconic knocks in the history of Indian cricket . It took place during India's 2004 tour of Pakistan in the first Test at Multan.Sehwag became the first Indian to score a triple century in Test cricket , achieving the feat in just 364 balls.Sehwag had a 336-run stand with his idol batting legend Sachin Tendulkar for the third wicket.Sehwag has more than once shared numerous anecdotes about his time with Tendulkar on the field, in the dressing room, during team dinners, and while traveling.And in a video that is viral on the internet, Sehwag narrated an interesting incident during his partnership with Tendulkar when he was warned against hitting a six.Sehwag says in the video, ""When he (Tendulkar) came to bat after the dismissal of Rahul Dravid , I was on 120, and just after his arrival I hit Saqlain Mushtaq for a six, the ball just went over the long-on fielder who tried for a catch but he could not take it. Master came with his bat and said 'ab agar tune chakka maara na toh main tere bat maarunga kheench ke'.""Sehwag continues, ""When I reached 295, I said if Saqlain Mushtaq comes in the attack, I will step out first ball and hit a six. He (Tendulkar) said are you mad? You'll become the first Indian player to hit 300. I replied no Indian has ever hit 295 even, I have become the first Indian. He walked back saying you are mad. Saqlain came, I stepped out and hit a six to reach 300 and Tendulkar was happier than me.""Sehwag's knock helped India post a massive total of 675/5 declared in the first innings, leading India to win by an innings and 52 runs.This innings is remembered not only for its historical significance but also for the aggressive and fearless manner in which Sehwag played against a strong Pakistani bowling attack that included Shoaib Akhtar , Mohammad Sami, and Saqlain Mushtaq.Though both Tendulkar and Sehwag were batting legends with different styles, their camaraderie and mutual respect on and off the field created a unique partnership that benefited the Indian team for many years.Their camaraderie extends off the field as well. Their bond, despite differences in personalities (Tendulkar being calm and composed, Sehwag more carefree and humorous), has always remained strong.The Tendulkar-Sehwag friendship stands as a testament to the spirit of Indian cricket during their playing days and continues to be celebrated even after both have retired from the game.",Virender Sehwag became the first Indian to score a triple century in Test cricket.

KANPUR: As you approached the Green Park Stadium on Sunday morning, you could see hordes of excited fans pointing towards the blue sky as they briskly walked to watch the third day of the second Test between India and Bangladesh .The smattering of dark clouds could not bog them down. Little did they know that poor condition of the outfield would not allow a ball to be bowled in the day.There was no rain all day.But there wasn't any play either. That effectively means that there is a very slim chance of getting a result and India may lose out on some crucial World Test Championship points.Covers were off but the umpires weren't happy with the outfield which was under covers for nearly two days. The match officials had told both teams to stay put at the hotel until there could be a chance of resuming play after they had gone off the field post lunch on Day One. The crowd waited patiently and vociferously cheered every time the officials came out to inspect the outfield, every two hours.Soon, things were to turn rather comical. When the umpires felt the field wasn't ready to start the game even at 12 pm and scheduled another inspection at 2 pm, the Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association (UPCA) officials started announcing that the game could not be started because of poor light. It was the brightest in the last three days!Shiv Kumar, the chief curator, claimed that the light wasn't good enough albeit one could see the umpires were concerned about some damp patches inside the 30-yard circle. ""The ground is absolutely fit to play. The moisture has been absorbed by the super sopper. The umpires feel it needs the sun for a natural element of heat,"" Shiv Kumar told TOI.At 2 pm, when the sun was beating down on the stadium, the officials called off the match citing a wet outfield .The Green Park Stadium's facilities have been under scrutiny for a while and UPCA's stubbornness to host the Test here despite the Indian team management's reluctance to play here must have left the association embarrassed.",Covers were off but the umpires weren't happy with the outfield which was under covers for nearly two days.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali feels that Kanpur should not host Test matches in the future, and if the second match between India and Bangladesh ends in a draw, then it could have a big impact on the hosts in the World Test Championship (WTC) standings.Only one session of the opening day has been played since the commencement of the Kanpur Test .On Sunday, the impact of rain continued to impact the Test as the third day was washed away due to wet outfield at Green Park .Basit Ali slammed the management for their inability to make the ground ready for play despite the availability of two super soppers.""They couldn't manage to dry the ground even though it hadn't rained since last night. Even after two super soppers, the ground was still wet. It means that covers were not great. Whoever is next BCCI secretary after Jay Shah should suspend Test matches in Kanpur,"" Basit said on his YouTube channel.Even though it didn't rain on Sunday, there were still some wet patches in the ground, including one near the bowler's run up area. The outfield could not be dried out despite the covers being peeled off.Basit went on to state that if the game ends up as a draw, it could have a major impact on their position in the WTC standings .""If the match ends up in a draw, then this result could affect India in the WTC standings. Everyone is thinking that India will win the three Tests against New Zealand. If one match ends up in a draw, then India could be in trouble. Kanpur doesn't deserve to host Test matches,"" he added.With seven wins, two losses, and a draw in 10 matches, India sit at the top of the rankings with a points percentage of 71.67 per cent.Australia closely follow on in the second spot with a point percentage of 62.50 per cent.

KANPUR: Despite a rain-free morning and bright sunshine later in the day, day three‚Äôs play of the second Test between India and Bangladesh was called off without a ball being bowled at the Green Park Stadium.The unexpected cause? A ‚Äòwet outfield‚Äô. Frustration grew as both teams remained at their hotel, while match officials inspected the field three times, all without covers.But there was no play, leading to two days now lost due to rain.Shiv Kumar, the pitch curator of the Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association (UPCA) maintained that everything was under control in Kanpur. But he admitted to having confusion regarding the match officials‚Äô reservations.‚ÄúThey gave us three different time for inspection but never told us what is the issue. Which area was wet or whatever is the problem. I told them that you can start the match but if you have any concern let me know,‚Äù he told IANS.With the morning and lunch sessions already lost, match referee Jeff Crowe conducted multiple inspections, but the soggy patches on the field, particularly in the deep mid-wicket area near Pavilion C, left him unsatisfied.The damp 30-yard circle also continued to concern, leading to the push of the pitch inspection to 2pm. Crowe, alongside reserve umpire Virender Sharma and TV umpire Rod Tucker, insisted on further delays, hoping for sunlight to dry the affected areas before allowing play to resume.Before the third inspection which was scheduled at 2pm, a senior ground official told IANS that the match officials wanted ground to dry up with natural light but were never told about the exact area of wet patch.‚ÄúMatch officials have asked us to wait for the natural light then only we can continue the play. The pitch and another part of the ground are perfectly good, there are certain areas of concern but we can start the play.‚Äù‚ÄúIf they want to wait for the sunlight, then they should have given the next inspection time at 1pm, because a little sunlight is always here which will dry the concerned area in an hour. We have already lost two sessions, next inspection at 2pm will lead us to call off the match,‚Äù a ground official working at the stadium told IANS.Spectators travelling from different parts of the state showed their frustration with the ground facilities at Green Park, leaving them disheartened and wanting UPCA to take good care of one of the oldest stadiums in the country, which has been hosting Test cricket since 1952.‚ÄúI am deeply feeling bad, Green Park is one of the oldest stadiums and we got a Test match after three years. The game should have continued for all five days, It‚Äôs the UPCA and the match organizers, who should be blamed. They are not taking proper care of it. We are coming from different parts of the state and investing money to watch the match but of what use,‚Äù said a fan from Fatehpur.Another fan from Kanpur said, ‚ÄúYe Green Park ko kuch ni milna chahie, yahan sab gadbad chal raha hai. Mahaul aisa banate hain jaise kitni suvidhaein hain but they can't even conduct a match on a day when it was a proper sunny. Green Park shouldn‚Äôt get a match, I am happy to travel to Lucknow or Varanasi but not Green Park.‚ÄùThe teams had played only 35 overs in the entire match so far, with Bangladesh standing at 107 for 3. The delay has sparked fresh criticism of the stadium‚Äôs drainage system, with questions raised on its readiness to host international games.When rain hampered the proceedings on day one, ground staff worked to dry the surface by using sawdust and covering the field, but the efforts were futile. Even with 75 groundsmen working tirelessly, the wet patches stubbornly remained, disappointing the thousands of spectators in the stands, who have been eager to witness a Test match.This isn‚Äôt the first time such issues have emerged. Memories of the recent Test between Afghanistan and New Zealand in Greater Noida came flooding back‚Äîwhen poor outfield conditions led to the match being abandoned without a ball being bowled earlier this month.The venue director, Sanjay Kapoor, assured before the game started that, ‚ÄúWe guarantee a five-day match here at the Green Park Stadium and we have ensured that everything is in place. We are prepared for rain but I assure you even if rain comes we will start the game in an hour or two.‚ÄùThe BCCI sources have suggested to IANS that the Green Park Stadium could lose out on hosting future international matches, with Lucknow‚Äôs Ekana Stadium‚Äîa state-of-the-art facility with superior infrastructure‚Äîemerging as a preferred alternative.Ekana Stadium has already hosted a Test match between Afghanistan and the West Indies, apart from being a home ground of Lucknow Super Giants in the IPL and hosting 2023 Men‚Äôs ODI World Cup games. It is all set to host the upcoming Irani Cup game between Rest of India and Ranji Trophy champions Mumbai from October 1-5.","Day three of the second Test between India and Bangladesh was called off without a ball being bowled at the Green Park Stadium in Kanpur.

NEW DELHI: Shoaib Akhtar , the "" Rawalpindi Express ,"" is renowned for his blistering pace, having bowled the fastest recorded delivery in cricket history - a scorching 161.3 km/h (100.2 mph) during the 2003 World Cup match in Cape Town.It was a delivery that left many batsmen rattled, struggling to keep up with his lethal speed. However, English batsman Nick Knight had a surprising and memorable reaction to one of Akhtar's fiery bullets.During a match between Pakistan and England, Akhtar unleashed one of his trademark thunderbolts, clocking an astounding 161.3 km/h. The delivery rocketed towards Knight, who had a calm and unexpected response. Rather than appearing fazed or intimidated, Knight simply shrugged off the delivery, even mocking the speed with an almost casual demeanor.His composed reaction to the ball left onlookers both surprised and amused. While Akhtar's fearsome pace was the stuff of legend, Knight's calm mockery stood out as a rare instance of a batsman nonchalantly handling one of the fastest balls ever bowled.This moment remains etched in cricket history, not only because of Akhtar's speed, but also due to Knight's cool-headedness in the face of such extreme pace. It exemplifies how, even in the face of intimidating fast bowling, a batsman‚Äôs calmness and confidence can sometimes defy the odds.Akhtar reminisced about how he had prepared himself to break the 100 mph barrier. ""When you touch 155 kph as a bowler, remember that you have another 5 kph inside you. However, adding that extra pace to your bowling requires specific training. Before I broke the 100 miles record, I was bowling at speeds of 157-158 kph but I was not able to reach 160. I was a bit baffled over the same, wondering why it was not happening,"" he told Sportskeeda.""I began by running with tires but soon realized that they are light. Next, I started pulling small vehicles with my shoulders. There is less public in Islamabad, so I used to pull vehicles in the night. I used to match its speed with the pace of my run-up. I realized that the vehicle is also small, so I started pulling a truck. I used to pull a truck for 4-5 miles.","Shoaib Akhtar bowled the fastest delivery in cricket history, clocking 161.3 km/h (100.2 mph) during the 2003 World Cup match in Cape Town.

NEW DELHI: Angel Correa scored in stoppage time and Atletico Madrid drew 1-1 with Real Madrid in a tense Spanish league Madrid derby that was interrupted for more than 15 minutes in the second half after Atletico fans threw objects onto the field.Correa equalized for Atletico in a breakaway five minutes into added time with a goal that was initially disallowed for offside but was awarded after video review.Eder Militao had given Madrid the lead in the 64th.The draw left Madrid in second place, three points behind leader Barcelona, which lost 4-2 to Osasuna on Saturday to end its seven-game winning streak. Atletico was third, two points behind Madrid after eight rounds.""I always think positively,"" Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. ""We moved closer to the leader and we have been playing well.""The derby was interrupted shortly after Madrid's goal at the Metropolitano, with the referee sending the players to the locker rooms after Atletico fans kept throwing objects onto the field.Militao had celebrated near the side line in front of Atletico fans, and Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was seen appearing to provoke Atletico fans after Militao scored.""What the fans did wasn't right but we are not helping when we provoke them,"" Atletico coach Diego Simeone said. ""I'm not justifying what the fans did, but we need to help as well.""It was Courtois who alerted the referee about the objects - including lighters - being thrown onto the field near him.Atletico defender Jose Maria Gimenez and midfielder Koke Resurreccion went to talk to the fans in the section behind Courtois' goal. That section is where usually the more radical Atletico supporters are located. Atletico coach Diego Simeone also asked several times for the fans to behave.A message over the stadium loudspeakers said the match was being interrupted for 15 minutes, and that it would be suspended if the problem continued.The interruption came a day after the Spanish league said it would ask police to act against the promoters of a social media campaign which the league said was aimed at promoting racist acts against Madrid star Vinicius Junior at the derby.The social media campaign was based on a hashtag encouraging Atletico fans to wear face masks, apparently to make it more difficult for authorities to identify individuals who participate in racist chants or insults.Social media videos showed Atletico fans before the match chanting ""Vinicius is different.""Vinicius occasionally clashed with Atletico players at the Metropolitano.Atletico's Marcos Llorente was sent off in stoppage time.Other results Fourth-place 10-man Athletic Bilbao conceded a stoppage-time equalizer in a 1-1 draw with Sevilla at home, while Giovani Lo Celso scored an 85th-minute goal in Real Betis' 1-0 home win over Espanyol.Iago Aspas got an 81st-minute equalizer for Celta Vigo in a 1-1 draw against visiting Girona.",Angel Correa scores in stoppage time as Atletico Madrid draws 1-1 with Real Madrid.

Alaeddine Ajaraei 's goal from a freekick was equalised by Noah Sadaoui's stunning strike as the Kerala Blasters FC salvaged a crucial point on the road.Right from kickoff, it was a very high-intensity match with end-to-end football from both sides.However, the visitors made the more impressive moves with the likes of Noah, Jesus Jimenez and Danish Farooq combining in attack.Kerala Blasters FC almost had the opener when their Moroccan superstar lost his marker and made a telling run down the left flank before finding Farooq in the box. Unfortunately the 28-year-old failed to make contact with the ball with only the goalkeeper to beat.Noah kept pushing for the opening goal as he once again dropped a shoulder and rifled an effort from outside the box but it was a whisker away from nestling into the top corner.The momentum of the game gradually shifted towards the Highlanders as Jithin MS made a surging run forward before releasing Guillermo Fernandez in space near the penalty box. With only the keeper to beat, the Spaniard scuffed his shot wide.A couple of minutes later, Guillermo and Ajaraei combined before the latter hammered a grounded effort which forced Sachin Suresh to come up with a sensational save before it brushed off the post.At the start of the second half, Mikael Stahre turned to Kwame Peprah to replace Alexandre Coeff as he wanted to add more guile to the attack.Kerala Blasters FC started the second essay brightly with Rahul KP getting more involved in play for them.The winger had a golden opportunity to break the deadlock following Vibin Mohanan's freekick which got deflected and fell right into Rahul's path in the penalty area. Unfortunately, his effort couldn't test Gurmeet Singh in goal.However, NorthEast United FC made them pay courtesy of a goal from Ajaraei in the 58th minute.The Moroccan struck a free-kick straight on goal and on any other day, Sachin would gather it with ease. But the young goalkeeper faltered with his collection as the ball crossed the line, awarding NorthEast United FC with the opening goal.Despite the goal, the visitors kept pushing forward in search of the equalizer. Noah with his mazy runs caused a lot of problems for the Highlanders' defence.Kerala Blasters FC were eventually rewarded in the 67th minute when substitute Mohammed Aimen released Noah just outside the box. The Moroccan superstar glided through a crowd of defenders before rifling his shot into the bottom left corner, beating Gurmeet completely in the process.Things became slightly more difficult for the hosts when Asheer Akhtar was given the marching orders in the 82nd minute for a reckless tackle on Noah.Kerala Blasters tried taking full advantage of the situation as Aimen almost came close to scoring twice in quick succession. One opportunity saw him go past an on-rushing Gurmeet only to get denied by a tackle from Michel Zabaco.",Alaeddine Ajaraei's goal from a freekick was equalised by Noah Sadaoui's stunning strike as the Kerala Blasters FC salvaged a crucial point on the road.

NEW DELHI: The FIFA Pusk√°s Award has long been recognized as the pinnacle of individual brilliance in football goal-scoring. Named after Hungarian legend Ferenc Pusk√°s, it celebrates the most aesthetically pleasing and remarkable goals each year.However, as with any award, the subjectivity of selection has led to some truly spectacular goals being overlooked.Here, we have five goals that, despite their brilliance, somehow missed out on the coveted Pusk√°s Award, leaving fans and pundits wondering how they didn‚Äôt make the cut.Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá is no stranger to wonder goals, but his stunning overhead kick for LA Galaxy against New England in 2019 deserved more recognition. With the ball lofted into the box, Zlatan demonstrated impeccable technique, timing his leap to unleash an acrobatic bicycle kick that nestled into the back of the net.It was the perfect combination of athleticism, audacity, and finishing prowess ‚Äî everything you‚Äôd expect from a Pusk√°s contender. However, despite being one of the standout goals of that MLS season, it didn‚Äôt make the final cut for the Pusk√°s nomination.Hatem Ben Arfa‚Äôs talent has always been mercurial, but when he‚Äôs in form, he‚Äôs capable of producing moments of pure magic. One such moment came in 2016 while playing for Nice against Rennes.Picking the ball up deep in his own half, Ben Arfa slalomed past five defenders with a blend of mesmerizing footwork and speed, before calmly slotting the ball past the goalkeeper.It was a solo goal of the highest order, reminiscent of Diego Maradona‚Äôs famous World Cup strike. Yet, despite its genius, Ben Arfa‚Äôs solo effort didn‚Äôt claim the Pusk√°s Award that year, much to the surprise of many.Few moments in football are as defining as scoring the winning goal in a major tournament final. Eder did just that, delivering a title-securing strike for Portugal in the Euro 2016 final against France.After receiving the ball from a deep midfield position, Eder took a touch and unleashed an unstoppable long-range effort that curled past Hugo Lloris, sealing Portugal‚Äôs first-ever European Championship.Given the magnitude of the occasion and the quality of the goal, many felt it deserved a Pusk√°s nomination. However, it wasn‚Äôt even shortlisted, leaving fans scratching their heads.One of the most jaw-dropping moments of Euro 2020 was Patrik Schick‚Äôs audacious long-range strike against Scotland. Spotting the goalkeeper off his line, Schick took aim from just inside the halfway line, curling the ball with perfect accuracy into the net.It was a goal that left viewers stunned, with the precision and audacity of the attempt setting it apart from anything seen in the tournament.Despite the goal being widely hailed as one of the best in recent international tournaments, it did not win the Pusk√°s Award, with many feeling it was unfairly overlooked.Few goals encapsulate the spirit and excitement of a World Cup quite like Siphiwe Tshabalala‚Äôs opening strike in the 2010 tournament.Playing for host nation South Africa, Tshabalala received a through ball on the left side of the pitch, took a perfect first touch, and rifled the ball into the top corner from the edge of the box.The goal was not only a thing of beauty but also carried immense historical significance, being the first goal scored on African soil in a World Cup.Many believed Tshabalala‚Äôs strike was a strong contender for the Pusk√°s Award, but it didn‚Äôt even make the final three, leading to widespread disappointment.",The FIFA Pusk√°s Award celebrates the most aesthetically pleasing and remarkable goals each year.

NEW DELHI: Key players will be side lined when the Champions League resumes Tuesday after a wave of injuries within a week of the new-look competition starting. Kylian Mbappe 's sore hamstring is likely to sideline him beyond Wednesday when he was due to return to France with defending champion Real Madrid to face Lille.Serious knee injuries mean Manchester City midfielder Rodri is out for the season and Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen will miss at least most of it.Inter Milan midfielder Nicolo Barella , who was a standout playing against Rodri on Sept. 18, will miss at least one Champions League game because of a thigh strain.The injuries to four players who were involved at the European Championship into the knockout phase have sharpened the debate about player workload in a calendar made more congested by the bigger Champions League.The extended program is what influential clubs all-but forced UEFA to create and the 18 games this week, split between Tuesday and Wednesday, still leaves each of them with six more to play through January.Another final rematch There were two repeats of past finals in the first week of games that relaunched the Champions League in a single-standings format. Man City and Inter drew 0-0 and Liverpool won 3-1 at AC Milan.The next rematch comes Wednesday when Aston Villa hosts Bayern Munich , a giant of the European Cup era that was shocked 1-0 in the 1982 final.Villa Park will host a first game in the competition since March 1983 when the English side's title defense was ended by Juventus.Both eased to winning starts two weeks ago. Villa won 3-0 at Young Boys and Bayern's nine goals against Dinamo Zagreb was a record for any team in the 33-season Champions League era. Harry Kane scored four in Bayern's 9-2 win and has a good record visiting Villa, with five goals there in five Premier League games for Tottenham. He faces a late check on an ankle injury.Kane edges Haaland Kane's fast start to the season with 10 goals in seven games for Bayern has outpaced even Erling Haaland's 10 in eight games for Man City.Haaland was kept quiet by Inter for the second time in 16 months, a fact he was reminded of in a post-game talk with the Italian champion's center back Francesco Acerbi, who smiled and held up two fingers.Haaland should find it easier on Tuesday in Slovakia when Man City faces Slovan Bratislava, which took the second biggest beating in the opening round, 5-1 at Celtic.Crowd size and fan fervour The pulsating atmosphere at Celtic Park for a rare European win by the Scottish champion stood out in an opening week where anticipation was not universal.Pundits including former Man City goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel noted a quietness about the stadium for the Inter game. The attendance was nearly 2,000 higher five days later when Man City met Arsenal in a tempestuous Premier League clash where title ambitions were already in play.Milan-Liverpool was a heavyweight European fixture yet far from sold out, with fewer than 60,000 at San Siro. The crowd topped 70,000 at each of Milan's first two Serie A home games this season, and 66,000 on the equivalent Champions League opening night last season to see another English club, Newcastle.Paris Saint-Germain drew at least 46,000 fans for each home game in Ligue 1 this season - and all three Champions League group-stage games last season - yet fewer than 40,000 were at Parc des Princes to see European debutant Girona two weeks ago.Sporting Lisbon also had 40,000 fans for a Champions League opener against Lille that was 6,000 down on the crowd for a domestic league game against Porto.The attendance and atmosphere trends will be watched as fans respond to the longer and more expensive program of four Champions League home games. The 36-team standings is set to be more dynamic for the final two rounds in January.Tuesday's games The raucous atmosphere should follow Celtic to Borussia Dortmund whose fans in the Yellow Wall tribune are among the noisiest in Europe.Bundesliga champion Bayer Leverkusen hosts Milan after making a fast star in a 4-0 rout at Feyenoord. San Siro now reverts to Inter to host Red Star Belgrade.Arsenal hosts PSG in a meeting of two teams chasing a trophy they never won. Each was a beaten finalist once. Also, Barcelona hosts Young Boys.Wednesday's games Even without Mbappe, Madrid should have too much for Lille playing in the stadium that hosted basketball group-stage games at the Paris Olympics.Premier League leader Liverpool hosts Bologna, and Girona's first European visitor to the Montilivi stadium is Feyenoord.Dinamo Zagreb fired its coach, Sergej Jakiroviƒá, after the drubbing at Bayern and brought back Nenad Bjelica for a second spell. He starts in the Champions League hosting Monaco.",Key players will be side lined when the Champions League resumes Tuesday. Kylian Mbappe's sore hamstring is likely to sideline him beyond Wednesday.

The FIFA World Cup has seen some of the greatest footballers etch their names into history with extraordinary goal-scoring feats. Since its inception in 1930, the tournament has provided a global stage for players to showcase their talents, and a select few have risen above the rest to become all-time leading goal scorers.Topping this list are legends who have defined eras and brought glory to their nations.Miroslav Klose , Ronaldo , Gerd M√ºller , Just Fontaine , and Lionel Messi are five players who have made their mark in the World Cup with exceptional scoring records.Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the top five all-time FIFA World Cup goal scorers and the impact they've had on the tournament's rich history.Miroslav Klose stands atop the list of FIFA World Cup all-time scorers with 16 goals, accumulated over four tournaments (2002, 2006, 2010, 2014). Klose's World Cup debut in 2002 saw him score 5 goals, helping Germany reach the final. He added 5 more in 2006 and 4 in 2010 before scoring his record-breaking 16th in the 2014 semifinal against Brazil. Klose‚Äôs crowning achievement came when he won the World Cup with Germany in 2014.Brazilian forward Ronaldo scored 15 World Cup goals across three tournaments (1998, 2002, 2006). He scored 4 goals in 1998, where Brazil finished as runners-up, and was the top scorer in 2002 with 8 goals, including a decisive brace in the final against Germany, as Brazil secured their fifth World Cup title. Despite injuries, Ronaldo added 3 more goals in 2006, taking his total to 15, a record that stood until 2014.Gerd Mueller was a prolific scorer for West Germany, netting 14 goals in just two World Cups (1970, 1974). His 10-goal haul in the 1970 edition led Germany to a semifinal finish. In 1974, he added 4 more goals to his tally, including the match-winner in the final against the Netherlands, as West Germany lifted the trophy on home soil.Just Fontaine‚Äôs record of 13 goals in a single World Cup, set in 1958, remains unmatched. The French striker's remarkable goal-scoring run in Sweden included a four-goal performance in the third-place match against West Germany. Despite playing in only one World Cup, Fontaine's sharp finishing and ability to score from various positions made him a standout figure. He led France to a third-place finish, their best performance at the time.Lionel Messi scored 13 goals across five FIFA World Cups. He made his World Cup debut in 2006, scoring once as a teenager. Despite not scoring in 2010, Messi provided key assists and led Argentina's attack. In 2014, he netted 4 goals and was named the tournament‚Äôs best player, guiding Argentina to the final. In 2018, Messi added one goal but faced an early exit. His crowning achievement came in 2022, scoring 7 goals, including two in the final, as he led Argentina to World Cup glory and won the Golden Ball.","Miroslav Klose, Ronaldo, Gerd M√ºller, Just Fontaine and Lionel Messi are the top five all-time FIFA World Cup goal scorers.

Take on

in their first home game of the season

KOLKATA: It's so far been a season that the NorthEast United FC fans had hoped for after a forgettable campaign last time around. Yet, most of them have not been able to see their heroes in action as the Highlanders played their title-winning Durand Cup campaign as well as their opening two games of the Indian Super League away from their base in Guwahati.But come Sunday, that's all going to change for NEUFC and their fervent local supporters when the Juan Pedro Benali-coached side take on Kerala Blasters FC at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium . And the Highlanders are treating it as a joyous occasion, overlooking the added pressure of a home match.""It's not pressure but really a pleasure to play the first home game,"" Benali said at the pre-match press conference in Guwahati on Saturday.""Since we started on the 14th of July, all the games we played were away. We played in Kokrajhar, we played in Shillong, and we played in Kolkata. This is the first home game for us. We are a little bit tired from travelling the whole time but we are fantastically happy to play at home, in front of our fans. It's a great feeling and we hope we have that feeling on the field, too.""It will be their first game since the heartbreaking 3-2 defeat toMohun Bagan Super Giants that once again brought to the fore the refereeing standards in ISL with the hosts' second goal. Benali, however, looked to have moved on from the controversy - terming the referees as ""human beings"" - and shifting focus to the home game at hand.""It will be a very difficult game for both of us tomorrow (Sunday) and a very nice game for the fans to watch. They are a very tactical team and so it will be a very tactical game. And I think the team that will be more calm and organised will win the game,"" he said.Nonetheless NEUFC will be eager for their second win after claiming their opener against Mohammedan Sporting, with Hamza Regragui returning to the squad after missing out on the previous fixture with illness.""I feel good,"" said the Moroccan defender on Saturday. ""We are training hard every day in the field, fully focused on the challenges ahead.""Kerala Blasters, too, will have the same goal of registering their next three points after defeating East Bengal in their last game for their first win of the season. Interestingly, Sunday's game will be their first of three consecutive away fixtures and coach Mikael Stahre is aware of the challenge before the Blasters.""We will be facing a good team, very organised, well coached and some absolutely interesting players. So, we need to stay humble,"" Kerala Blasters coach Mikael Stahre said at his pre-match interaction in Guwahati. ""But we need to focus on our game and keep up the momentum from the first win.""However, the last time they met in Guwahati, Jithin MS and Nestor Albiach earned the hosts a crucial win against the Blasters and the home fans will hope for an encore when the teams take the field again on Sunday.",NorthEast United FC take on Kerala Blasters FC at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium on Sunday.

Chhetri becomes ISL's top-scorer after scoring against Bagan

BENGALURU: Bengaluru FC skipper Sunil Chhetri emerged as the Indian Super League 's top-scorer firing in his 64th goal in his 152nd match as the Blues engineered a 3-0 win against Mohun Bagan Super Giant to climb to the top of the standings.Changing ends with a two goal deficit, Bagan tried to stage a comeback making few key substitutions but their efforts came undone when defender Dippendu Biswas brought down BFC striker Edgar Mendez inside the box and conceded a penalty in the 51st minute.Chhetri, who was replaced in the 75th minute, scored with a neat placement beating Bagan 'keeper Vishal Kaith to his right. He thus emerged on top of the charts leaving Nigerian Barth Ogbeche in second place. It was sweet revenge for BFC, they almost made it 4-0 in the 90th minute, who had crashed to a 0-4 defeat against the Kolkata side last season. Incidentally, it was also the last time the Blues lost at home and are now unbeaten in 10 games under coach Gerard Zaragoza .It was an overall team effort that also saw the Rahul Bheke-led defence help Gurpreet Singh Sandhu keep his third straight clean sheet. The former champions are the only side who are yet to concede a goal this season after clearing the toughest test of the season so far with flying colors.Bengaluru translated their confidence from their first two wins into a dominating show as they came up trumps in an entertaining match that lasted 103 minutes. The matchup between two unbeaten sides saw the hosts pressing hard early on. The Blues, who faced flak last year for their goal drought, were 2-0 up by the 20th minute as they made full use of Bagan's defensive lapses. Highly rated Spanish striker Mendez found his rhythm against Bagan as he repeatedly troubled the rival defence moving up through the right. His pace and physical presence made him a constant threat in the Bagan box as he repeatedly powered his way in. BFC took the lead in the ninth minute after threatening a few times early on. Medio Alberto Noguera's kick came down nicely and Nikhil Poojary smartly slotted it for Mendez in front who scored with a cracking finish.Bagan, who had conceded four goals in their two matches, were soon trailing as Suresh Singh made full use of an assist by skipper Sunil Chhetri who was back in the starting XI. Once again it was Mendez who did the spade as he sped through the right and pushed it into the box. Chhetri was marked tightly but he still managed to poke it to Suresh who scored in the 20th minute. The Bagan defence were in total disarray and Chhetri soon had a chance to make it 3-0 but he failed to beat Kaith.",Bengaluru FC captain Sunil Chhetri becomes ISL's top-scorer after scoring against Bagan.

Dusan Vlahovic fired Juventus top of Serie A with a brace in Saturday's 3-0 win at Genoa who were forced to play behind closed doors as punishment for fan disorder in their midweek Italian Cup defeat to local rivals Sampdoria.Juventus are a point ahead of Torino, AC Milan and Inter Milan , who were 3-2 winners at Udinese earlier on Saturday, after Vlahovic settled a match played in an atmosphere that harked back to the Covid-19 pandemic.The Serbia striker has struggled for form in the early weeks of the season, only netting in one of his previous six Juventus appearances.But he opened the scoring from the penalty spot two minutes after half-time before rifling home from Teun Koopmeiners' fine pass in the 55th minute.""People talk, say that you're the best when you score goals and a flop when you don't. I do my talking on the pitch,"" said Vlahovic to DAZN.""I know very well that there is a lot expected of me and I am not running away from that.""Thiago Motta's team, who also scored in the final minutes through substitute Francisco Conceicao, are yet to concede a league goal this season and snapped a run of three consecutive goalless draws in Serie A with a professional display.Juve could have won by more as Koopmeiners somehow failed to push home Conceicao's low cross in the 64th minute, hitting the crossbar from inside the six-yard box.The away side's task was made easier with Genoa's passionate support shut out of the Stadio Luigi Ferraris in the aftermath of the encounter with their second-tier neighbours Sampdoria.Prolonged clashes between the hardcore ultras before and after Wednesday's fraught derby cup tie led to dozens of injuries to fans and police and a crackdown by Italy's security authorities.A third defeat of the season left Genoa in 16th place and one point above the relegation zone.Lautaro Martinez struck his first goals of the season in Inter's entertaining win at Udinese.Davide Frattesi's deft finish after just 43 seconds was followed by Argentina forward Martinez's strikes moments before and after half-time.The win in Udine helped Inter bounce back from Milan derby defeat last weekend and move up to fourth, on 11 points after six matches.""After the derby we kept quiet and worked hard and I think you saw that on the pitch,"" said Martinez to DAZN.Martinez's brace will be great news for coach Simone Inzaghi whose team host Red Star Belgrade in the Champions League on Tuesday night.Before Saturday, last season's Serie A top scorer had not scored since netting the winner for his country in the Copa America final in July.""It definitely important for me because a striker is always on the hunt for goals,"" he said.""I always say that first I work for the team, and if I manage to score then so much the better.""Lazar Samardzic snatched a late 1-1 draw at 10-man Bologna with a brilliant 90th-minute leveller ahead of their Champions League trip to Shakhtar Donetsk.Midfielder Samardzic rammed home his equaliser seconds after striking the post, saving a point after playing with an extra man for almost all of the second half following Jhon Lucumi's 51st minute sending off.Atalanta are ninth and level on seven points with Bologna, who face a daunting Champions League trip to Anfield to take on Liverpool on Wednesday.",Dusan Vlahovic scores twice as Juventus beat Genoa 3-0 in Serie A. Genoa forced to play behind closed doors as punishment for fan disorder. Lautaro Martinez scores first goals of the season in Inter's 3-2 win at Udinese.

NEW DELHI: Carlos Alcaraz cruised past Tallon Griekspoor 6-1, 6-2 at the China Open in Beijing, securing his 200th tour-level victory on Sunday.The victory sent Alcaraz to the quarterfinals, and made him the third player born in this century to achieve the 200-win feat along with Jannik Sinner and Felix Auger-Aliassime .""I'm really happy about it, 200 wins is a great number,"" the 21-year-old Alcaraz said.""But I am already looking for the third hundred. I just want to keep going, to keep rolling. I am looking forward to playing matches and to keep doing the things that I am doing.""Pegula keeps momentum In the women's tournament, third-ranked Jessica Pegula responded to losing a marathon first set to rally for a 6-7 (9), 6-1, 6-2 win over Veronika Kudermetova in the third round.The No. 6-ranked Coco Gauff beat Katie Boulter 7-5, 6-2. Four-time major winner Naomi Osaka will now play Katie Volynets on Monday after heavy rain in the afternoon.Pegula has won 17 of her last 19 matches, including defending her title in Toronto and making finals at Cincinnati and the U.S. Open, where her only defeats have come to Aryna Sabalenka, the top-seeded player in Beijing.The American made three service breaks in the first set, but also lost three of her own, with Kudermetova prevailing in a lung-busting 20 point tiebreaker to take the lead.The loss of the tiebreaker seemed to spur Pegula to life as she found her groundstroke range to break her Russian opponent's serve twice in each set to take the match in just over 2 1/2 hours. It was Pegula's first win against the 39th-ranked Kudermetova in three attempts.Pegula will play the 15th-seeded Paula Badosa in the fourth round after the Spaniard beat Rebecca Sramkova 7-5, 7-5.Poland's Magdalena Frech, seeded 23rd, overcame a disastrous start to rally to a three-set win over 12th-seeded Diana Shnaider 0-6, 6-3, 6-4 and next faces the 595th-ranked wildcard Zhang Shuai , who beat Greet Minnen of Belgium 6-2, 6-3.In the men's draw, local favorite Bu Yunchaokete upset Paris Olympics bronze medalist Lorenzo Musetti 6-2, 6-4 for the 22-year-old's first victory against a top 20-player.The 96th-ranked Bu will next play either fifth-seeded Andrey Rublev or Alejando Davidovich Fokina.Seventh-seeded Karen Khachanov made 15 fewer winners and four more unforced errors than Argentine Francisco Cerundolo, but found a way to win the big points in a 7-6 (4), 7-6 (9) victory to take him through to the quarterfinals and a matchup against Alcaraz.Alcaraz needs to make at least the semifinals this week to rise above Alexander Zverev to No. 2 in the rankings. Zverev is not playing in Beijing as he recovers from an illness.","Carlos Alcaraz beats Tallon Griekspoor 6-1, 6-2 at the China Open in Beijing.

BEIJING: Top-ranked Jannik Sinner rallied to beat Roman Safiullin 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 in the second round of the China Open on Saturday and learned afterward that his steroid case is far from over.While Sinner was on court in Beijing, the World Anti-Doping Agency announced it was seeking a ban of one to two years for the U.S. Open champion who tested positive twice for an anabolic steroid in March but was not suspended in a decision by an independent tribunal announced by the International Tennis Integrity Agency on Aug.20 because the ITIA determined he was not to blame.Sinner's fate will now be determined by the Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport after WADA said it filed an appeal on Thursday.""Obviously, I'm very disappointed and also surprised of this appeal, to be honest, because we had three hearings,"" Sinner said at a press conference after his match Saturday. ""All three hearings came out very positively for me.""You know, I was not expecting it. I knew it couple of days ago, that they were going to appeal, that today it's going to go official. But yeah, it's surprise.""On court Saturday, the two-time Grand Slam champion again found himself behind in the Chinese capital after Safiullin broke serve twice to claim the opening set.Sinner's power and laser-like accuracy from the baseline gradually chipped away at his Russian opponent and helped the Italian to win seven straight games from 2-2 in the second set to take the ascendancy and close out a gritty win.Sinner, who has reached at least the quarterfinals at every tour-level event he has played in 2024, will next play Jiri Lehecka, who earlier defeated Roberto Bautista Agut 3-6, 6-2, 6-1.Third-seeded Daniil Medvedev , who lost to Sinner in this year's Australian Open final, also reached the last eight after beating French veteran Adrian Mannarino 7-6 (6), 6-2.Medvedev, the 2021 U.S. Open champion, had eight aces and broke Mannarino's serve four times as he advanced to his 75th tour-level quarterfinal.""Titles are more important obviously than finals. But even then 75 quarterfinals are great,"" said Medvedev, who is Russian. ""When I made my first quarterfinal (it) was (in) Moscow and I was pretty happy. And now it's 75. I am still happy, but not the same way.""He next faces Italy's Flavio Cabolli, who advanced with a 6-4, 6-2 win over Pavel Kotov.In the women's draw, U.S. Open champion Aryna Sabalenka advanced to the third round with a 6-4, 6-1 win over Thai qualifier Mananchaya Sawangkaew.""In the first set, I was struggling a little bit with the rhythm,"" said Sabalenka, who's best run in Beijing has only been to the quarterfinals. ""In the second set, seems like everything started working much better. I think that's why it was more smooth and better quality.""The second-ranked Sabalenka is the top seed in Beijing in the absence of Iga Swiatek .Next up for the three-time major winner is American Ashlyn Krueger, who beat New Zealand's Lulu Sun 6-1, 7-6 (4).Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen of China, seeded fifth, also advanced with a 6-1, 6-1 win over unseeded Kamilla Rakhimova. Her next opponent, Nadia Podoroska of Argentina, is also unseeded.Third-seeded Jasmine Paolini of Italy rallied from a poor first set to beat Denmark's Clara Tauson 1-6, 7-5, 6-4. Paolini, the French Open and Wimbledon runner-up, will play Poland's Magda Linette after the 31st-seeded player also needed three sets to progress past Moyuka Uchijima 6-4, 4-6, 6-3.Ninth-seeded Daria Kasatkina of Russia beat Croatian Jana Fett 6-1, 6-2. She will play Amanda Anisimova, who beat Camila Osorio of Colombia 1-6, 6-3, 6-4.Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova was upset 1-6, 6-4, 7-5 by Romania's Jaqueline Cristian.American Madison Keys, seeded 18th, won 6-2, 6-1 against Spaniard Sara Sorribes Tormo and next faces 13th-seeded Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil.Japan Open Tomas Machac upset fifth-seeded Tommy Paul 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (4) to advance to the quarterfinals and continued a disappointing week for the top-seeded players in Tokyo.Top-seeded Taylor Fritz, third-seeded Casper Ruud and fourth-seeded Stefaos Tsitsipas were all beaten in the first round, before second-seeded Hubert Hurkacz was also eliminated as he lost to U.S. Open semifinalist Jack Draper 6-4, 6-4 in the second round.Sixth-seeded Holger Rune is the highest-ranked seed remaining in the draw. Rune, from Denmark, beat home favorite Yoshihito Nishioka 6-2, 6-4.Defending champion Ben Shelton , the No. 8 seed, is the only other seeded player left in the quarterfinal draw.Alex Michelsen of the U.S. also advanced after a 6-1, 6-4 win over Australian Christopher O'Connell to set up a quarterfinal match against Machac.Kei Nishikori beat Jordan Thompson 6-2, 6-3 and will play Rune in the quarterfinals.","Top-ranked Jannik Sinner rallies to beat Roman Safiullin 3-6, 6-2,. 6-3 in the second round of the China Open.

Vijay turns his tennis around despite financial challenges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/vijay-turns-his-tennis-around-despite-financial-challenges/articleshow/113769629.cms,"Vijay Sundar Prashanth during the ATP 250 men's tennis event in Hangzhou, China, last week

PUNE: Sometimes the sequel can be better than the original.If his tennis career were to be divided in two halves, there would be no prizes for guessing which one Vijay Sundar Prashanth would cherish more.The 37-year-old has been living his dreams these past couple of years. He notched up three Challenger doubles titles in 2023 in partnership with Anirudh Chandrasekar , 11 years younger to him.The pair played the Australian Open this year, first appearance in a Grand Slam for both, before a string of poor results saw them part ways.Vijay, however, found his mojo back quickly after starting to combine with his childhood friend Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan from May.The duo reached the final of the clay-court Challenger in Bonn in August and took it up to another level last week by clinching the ATP 250 Series event in Hangzhou, China.""I mean, it's a great feeling after having gone through the journey. And, I would say some type of validation that we are doing the right things and on the right path,"" said Vijay of his maiden success on the ATP Tour in a measured tone, belying the overwhelming emotions he was experiencing.Except in the opening round, all three teams the Indian combination subsequently defeated enroute to the trophy featured top-50 ranked players - Julian Cash (38) and Lloyd Glasspool (42) in the second round, Ariel Behar (45) and Robert Galloway (40) in the semis, and Constantin Frantzen (47) and Hendrick Jebens (47) in the final.""To be honest, we didn't expect to win the title. I mean, we always believed in ourselves and our talent, and we believed that we can match any team at the highest level,"" Vjay said.""With the doubles format, we knew that we had to play good on big points. I think we did it well this week.""Actually, to do it back to back for four matches and against top 50 teams, that really surprised us. But also not in a big way, because I think both of us truly believed that we could match any team in this tournament.""Playing with Jeevan seems to bring out the best in him.""We are very familiar with each other, we've known each other for almost 25 years, on court and off court. We grew up together in Chennai. So that makes it easier to work as a team,"" Vijay said.""We acknowledge each other's analysis after the match and feedback with an open mind, so it helps the team progress.""We kind of know we are in it for a long run, and we are not going to judge the partnership based on a few bad results or a few first-round defeats. That's how we've taken it, so that‚Äôs helped.""But the journey has not always been a bed of roses. The covid pandemic disrupted his career right when he was shifting focus to doubles and the prolonged period of uncertainty was much harsh on someone who has had to deal with financial constraints right through his career.""Yes, after covid, it was tough, because for most tennis players who weren't playing at the highest level, they had to, I had to re-evaluate my whole career, my life, how to take it forward,"" he said.""That's when I felt doubles could be a viable option to continue, because at least I would be playing the Challenger tour, which technically would help me progress up the ladder and financially help me sustain playing the sport.""Since then, I've had a lot more clarity on how to approach doubles. And I have this blind belief that I can be a very good doubles player. That has just translated (to) on-court.""The revival began when his contemporary and former Tamil Nadu state-mate PC Vignesh asked him if he was willing to combine with his younger brother Anirudh.Anirudh had made a pretty early decision to play doubles full-time and Vignesh felt the seasoned Vijay would be the ideal partner to guide Anirudh.""The partnership with Anirudh was good because we kind of made use of each other's strengths,"" Vijay said.""He made use of my experience, and I made use of his young, enthusiastic energy, which I was lacking.""Because I was coming back after lockdown, (I was) searching for answers, and someone who had that motivation and enthusiasm, it rubbed off on me, and I was giving him the experience.""Then we kind of worked our way. So, it was actually a good partnership because we had to climb different levels.""We had to work as a team. For the first time in my career, I worked as a team with someone, and we had to cross many barriers. We played the first slam (for both) together. So, it was really good, yeah.""While he has managed to turn things around on the tennis court, it is yet to translate into financial security - given the low purse offered in doubles.""To be honest, what's always been the challenge for me my entire career is the financial aspect of playing the sport professionally,"" Vijay said.""I don't know how long I can sustain because now I am married, I have a five-month-old baby. So, I have to think about that aspect of life as well.""So, I've accepted that it's never going to go away. It's up to me to start doing well, and then I can generate my own funds and sustain myself playing at this level.""So, for me personally, that's the only challenge, everything else, I'm very confident about myself, my work ethic, the partner that I have, and the circle that I've created around myself.""My wife has been very supportive of my career, which is really crucial at this stage.""So, the only challenge for me is the financial aspect. Hopefully there comes a stage where I don't have to worry about it.""","Vijay Sundar Prashanth won the ATP 250 Series event in Hangzhou, China. The 37-year-old has been living his dreams these past couple of years.

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner ‚Äôs ongoing doping controversy has ignited discussions about doping in tennis once again. While Sinner, ranked among the top tennis players in the world, continues to appeal his case after testing positive for an anabolic steroid, the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) is seeking a ban.The tennis world is watching closely, as this case brings back memories of other high-profile doping bans in the sport.That said, we look at five tennis stars who were banned for doping.In 2016, the tennis world was stunned when Maria Sharapova, one of the most celebrated female players, tested positive for meldonium at the Australian Open.Meldonium, which had just been added to the banned substances list, was a heart medication Sharapova had been using legally for many years. She was initially handed a two-year ban by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), but after appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), her suspension was reduced to 15 months.Sharapova admitted to not being aware of meldonium‚Äôs addition to the banned list, and though the ban affected her career, she returned to the sport in 2017.Five-time Grand Slam champion Martina Hingis shocked the tennis world in 2007 when she announced she had tested positive for cocaine at Wimbledon.Hingis denied ever taking the drug, but chose not to contest the result. She retired from tennis soon after and was handed a two-year ban by the ITF.Despite the ban, Hingis's legacy remains strong, and she later made a successful comeback in doubles tennis, further cementing her place in tennis history.Simona Halep, a two-time Grand Slam champion, was handed a four-year ban in September 2023 after testing positive for the banned substance Roxadustat at the 2022 US Open. However, it was later cut to nine months.Halep has consistently maintained her innocence, claiming the result was due to contamination or an unintentional error. Despite her defence, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) pursued a thorough investigation, leading to the suspension.The case has raised questions about doping regulations and the challenges athletes face in proving their innocence when contamination is alleged. Halep's career now hangs in the balance as she fights to restore her reputation.The Croatian tennis star Marin ƒåiliƒá was banned in 2013 after testing positive for the stimulant nikethamide. ƒåiliƒá claimed he had inadvertently ingested the banned substance through glucose tablets and contested the severity of the ban.Initially banned for nine months, the suspension was later reduced to four months by CAS.ƒåiliƒá went on to win the 2014 US Open, proving that a doping ban, while damaging, doesn‚Äôt necessarily end a player‚Äôs career.In 2009, French tennis player Richard Gasquet tested positive for cocaine and was handed a 12-month ban by the ITF. However, Gasquet's defence was one of the more unusual in sports doping history.He claimed that he had ingested the drug inadvertently by kissing a woman who had consumed cocaine in a nightclub. An independent tribunal accepted his explanation and reduced his ban to two and a half months, allowing him to return to competition soon after.The current case with Jannik Sinner bears some similarities to these past incidents, especially in terms of contested explanations and appeals.Sinner, who tested positive for low levels of Clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid, claims the substance entered his system accidentally through his physiotherapist's treatment. Despite three hearings that ruled in Sinner‚Äôs favour, WADA has appealed the case, seeking a one-to-two-year ban, which could disrupt the young player's rising career.","Jannik Sinner tested positive for Clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid.

BEIJING: Jannik Sinner said he was ""disappointed and surprised"" Saturday after the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) appealed the decision to clear him in his steroid case, seeking a ban of up to two years.The Italian world number one twice tested positive for traces of the banned substance clostebol in March but was exonerated and allowed to carry on playing.The 23-year-old went on to win the US Open earlier this month for his second major crown, weeks after the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) found he ""bears no fault or negligence"".The ITIA accepted his explanation that the drug entered his system when his physiotherapist used a spray containing it to treat a cut, then provided massage and sports therapy to the player.WADA on Thursday appealed the high-profile case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport .""It is WADA's view that the finding of 'no fault or negligence' was not correct under the applicable rules,"" it said in a statement on Saturday.WADA made the appeal announcement as Sinner was on court at the China Open, where the defending champion fought back to beat 69th-ranked Russian Roman Safiullin 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 in Beijing.""WADA is seeking a period of ineligibility of between one and two years,"" it added.Sinner has consistently denied knowingly doping and said after his win: ""Obviously I'm very disappointed and also surprised.""We had three hearings. All three hearings came out very positively for me.""Clostebol is an anabolic agent prohibited at all times by WADA.After winning the US Open, Sinner said that the controversy over his failed tests was still on his mind.He defeated Taylor Fritz in straight sets to add the New York title to his Australia Open triumph in January.""It was and it's still on my mind. It's not that it's gone, but when I'm on court, I try to focus about the game, I try to handle the situation the best possible way, communication with the team, in the practice courts,"" said the world number one.""It was not easy, that's for sure, but I tried to stay focused, with which I guess I've done a great job.""The decision to clear the Italian was met with scepticism by some players in the locker room who suggested that Sinner had benefited from preferential treatment due to his status in the sport.Australia's Nick Kyrgios said in a post on X that the lack of a suspension was ""ridiculous"".Canadian player Denis Shapovalov said the decision proved that there are ""different rules for different players"" suggesting that Sinner was saved by his ranking.On court in Beijing, Sinner fell behind against the ""lucky loser"" Safiullin on Saturday after also dropping a set in his opening victory over Chile's Nicolas Jarry.The second set went with serve until the sixth game when Sinner finally broke to go up 4-2, celebrating with a subtle fist pump.Sinner took control early on in the deciding set on the way to an ultimately comfortable victory to reach the last eight, where he faces Jiri Lehecka of the Czech Republic.In-form Sinner has reached at least the quarter-final of every tournament he has played this year.","Jannik Sinner says he is ""disappointed and surprised"" by World Anti-Doping Agency's appeal.

South Korean Lee Hyun Il is Sindhu's consulting coach

BENGALURU: After a disappointing Paris Olympics , PV Sindhu has a new coach, though temporarily, in former Olympian Anup Sridhar . The two-time Olympic medallist will work with the Karnataka man for the remainder of the year and the duo will sit down by the year-end to decide upon the future.Sridhar came into the picture after Sindhu's coach Indonesian Agus Dwi Santoso's contract got over after the quadrennial event.The former international player was taken on board after a successful meeting with the star player and her team. For the last three weeks, the ace shuttler, who trained at the Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy (PPBA) before Paris, has been sweating it out for almost five hours daily under the watchful eyes of Sridhar at the Gachibowli Stadium in Hyderabad. She has been involved in sparring sessions and fitness routines too. The current coaching team also includes former Korean shuttler Lee Hyun Il .Sridhar is pleased with the way the new partnership has begun and is keen to work on different aspects of Sindhu's game in the coming weeks. ""The start has been good so far. The first thing was to get her pain free, playing and moving freely on the court, which we have achieved. Now we're working on getting her speed and endurance levels up. There's a decent amount of improvement,"" Sridhar told TOI. ""I have tried to devise training programmes and routines around the areas that she's finding a little bit difficult.""The last 21 months has not been great for Sindhu as she did not win a single BWF singles title. The task is now cut out for Sridhar as her results in the next three months could prove to be the difference between a long or short-term association with Sindhu. However, the Bengaluruean is looking beyond the results.""The results are certainly important, but I wouldn't say it is the only important thing to look at. No miracles are going to be performed either by me or by anybody else, real change takes time. But I think this period is important from the point of view of how we work together, how we communicate. The working relationship will be important,"" he said.To start with, Sindhu has marked two events for next month, the Arctic Open in Finland (Oct 8-13, Super 500), and Denmark Open in Odense (Oct 15-20, Super 750). ""She's hungry to do well,"" said Sridhar NEW DELHI: PV Sindhu will have South Korean great Lee Hyun Il as her consulting coach on interim basis as she bolstered her coaching team ahead of her anticipated return to action next month.",Former Olympian Anup Sridhar will work with the Karnataka man for the remainder of the year. The pair will sit down by the year-end to decide upon the future.
