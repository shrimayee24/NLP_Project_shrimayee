NEW DELHI: Afghanistan secured a spot in the Super Eight phase of the 2024 T20 World Cup with a seven-wicket victory over Papua New Guinea, knocking New Zealand out of the competition. Fazalhaq Farooqi led Afghanistan’s bowling, taking three wickets and contributing to PNG’s total of 95.Despite early losses, Afghanistan chased down the target in 15.1 overs, finishing at 101-3. Gulbadin Naib, unbeaten on 49, and Mohammad Nabi, with 16 not out, anchored the chase. This win, Afghanistan’s third in a row, guarantees their place alongside hosts West Indies in the next round. Farooqi’s performance brought his tournament wicket tally to 12, four more than his closest rivals, showcasing Afghanistan’s growing prowess in T20 cricket.As the group stage of the tournament edges towards its climax, numerous teams have solidified their positions in the Super Eight.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan cricket team has become a centre of criticism since their humiliating first-round exit from the T20 World Cup . The 2009 champions were eliminated following the abandonment of the USA-Ireland match due to rain.The team endured a startling loss against tournament debutants USA and subsequently fell short against arch-rivals India. Pakistan's sole triumph came in their encounter with Canada.Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram , who has been a staunch critic of Pakistan's poor performances in the past, didn't hesitate to express his disappointment and even took a jab at his own team.On the official Instagram account of the ICC, Akram responded to the news of USA qualifying for the Super Eight stage. While he extended his congratulations to Monank Patel's team, Akram also had a blunt message for the Pakistani side, led by Babar Azam .""Congratulations to the USA, They've done amazingly well. When you talk about globalization of the game, this is it. USA qualified for the Super Eight, they deserve to be there. They defeated Pakistan, in their group match. For Pakistan, what's the plan? EK 601 (flight number) to Dubai, to their respective cities. From then, we will see what happens,"" said Akram.Earlier, Akram also blamed biased selection for Pakistan's below-par performances in the T20 World Cup.""Pakistani players think that if they don't perform well, the coaches will be sacked, and nothing will happen to them,"" Akram said during a broadcast after the defeat to India.""It is time to keep the coaches and change the entire team.""Former player Kamran Akmal said Shadab Khan was chosen to play because he is close to captain Babar Azam, and that meant leaving out leg-spinner Usama Mir, the top wicket-taker in this year's Pakistan Super League.""When you select players based on friendship, you'll get these results,"" Akmal told AFP. ""Mir should have been in the squad... That was a big injustice.""",Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram takes a jab at his own team.

NEW DELHI: As the initial group stage of the T20 World Cup approaches its end, two spots remain open for the 'Super 8s' round. Defending champions England and Bangladesh are currently the frontrunners to join the six already qualified teams.The tournament has seen notable exits, with Pakistan, New Zealand, and Sri Lanka already eliminated.Currently, India leads Group A, Australia tops Group B, Afghanistan holds the number one spot in Group C, and South Africa is the frontrunner in Group D.The one remaining spot on offer in Group B is being contested between neighbours England and Scotland. England's first game in the group was washed out against Scotland, and they lost the next to traditional rivals Australia. England's comprehensive victory over Oman in 19 balls has improved their chances immensely, but they still need to beat Namibia and hope the Scots don't upset Australia.England are currently in third position with three points from their three games and a net run rate of +3.081. They need to win their last match in the group stage to secure five points. That will bring them on equal points with Scotland (5 each) if the Scots lose their concluding group game against Australia, which is likely. In that eventually, England, who already have a better net run rate than Scotland, will go through.With England's qualification still not confirmed, Australia fast bowler Josh Hazlewood said, ""In this tournament, you potentially come up against England at some stage again, and they're probably one of the top few teams on their day. We've had some real struggles against them in T20 cricket, so if we can get them out of the tournament, that's in our best interest as well as probably everyone else's. It'll be interesting to see. We've never really been in this position before as a team.""Hazlewood has no doubt that Australia will aim for a clean sweep in the group by defeating Scotland, but there is also the temptation to assist Scotland in maintaining their net run rate over England. ""There are a few options, like getting close and just knocking it around to drag it out,"" Hazlewood added.As of June 14, six teams have secured their spots in the T20 World Cup Super 8s stage. India, USA, Australia, Afghanistan, West Indies, and South Africa have all advanced to the next round. Among these, only the USA has suffered a defeat in their group matches, with all other teams remaining undefeated.An exciting match is on the horizon when Afghanistan take on co-hosts West Indies in Group C. The result in this match will end the unbeaten run of one of these two teams before entering the 'Super 8s'.Group 1: A1 (India), B2 (Australia), C1 (New Zealand), D2 (Sri Lanka)Group 2: A2 (Pakistan), B1 (England), C2 (West Indies), D1 (South Africa)The USA will now play as A2 after Pakistan's elimination from the T20 World Cup 2024.Meanwhile, Afghanistan will take the C1 spot following New Zealand's exit from the tournament.Bangladesh are emerging as a strong contender for the D2 position, potentially replacing Sri Lanka, which has also been knocked out.On the other hand, if Scotland manage to upset Australia, they will take England's spot as B1. If Scotland fail to win against Australia, the decision will come down to net run rate.","England and Bangladesh are currently the frontrunners to join the six already qualified teams. Pakistan, New Zealand, and Sri Lanka already eliminated. India leads Group A, Australia tops Group B, Afghanistan holds the number one spot in Group C, and South Africa is the frontrunner in Group D.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110991865,imgsize-74408,width-400,resizemode-4/110991865.jpg"

Euro 2024: England hang on to beat Serbia 1-0 with Jude Bellingham header,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/euro-2024-england-hang-on-to-beat-serbia-1-0-with-jude-bellingham-header/articleshow/111047384.cms,"NEW DELHI: Jude Bellingham 's first-half header gave England a 1-0 victory over Serbia, kicking off their Euro 2024 campaign on a high note. The match began confidently for England but ended with them holding on for the win.Bellingham timed his run perfectly to meet Bukayo Saka's deflected cross, scoring from close range in the 13th minute. The goal came after Bellingham started the move himself, helping put England ahead early in the game.This win placed England at the top of Group C, following Denmark and Slovenia's 1-1 draw earlier in the day. Bellingham stayed involved throughout, driving England's attack and drawing loud cheers from fans at the Arena AufSchalke.Gareth Southgate 's team initially created opportunities down the right side, with Saka combining well with fullback Kyle Walker. Walker's runs were a consistent threat in the first half.However, Serbia gained momentum in the second half, posing more of a challenge. England struggled to replicate their early dominance after halftime.By the end of the match, there were only 11 total shots, with Serbia taking six and England five. This was the lowest shot tally in a European Championship match since at least 1980, according to Opta data.When asked if the loss of momentum indicated that England was still a work in progress, Bellingham took issue with the suggestion.""I don't agree with that,"" he said. ""I think the first half shows why we can score goals against any team and the second half shows why we can keep a clean sheet against any team.""At the start of the second half, Serbia improved their play after coach Dragan Stojkovic substituted Ivan Ilic for defensive midfielder Nemanja Gudelj. Striker Dusan Vlahovic soon sent a dangerous cross through England's box, energizing the Serbian fans.Stojkovic then intensified his offensive strategy by bringing on Dusan Tadic and Luka Jovic just past the hour mark.In response, England's coach, Gareth Southgate, introduced the energetic Conor Gallagher, replacing Trent Alexander-Arnold, who was playing in an unusual midfield position.Another substitute, Jarrod Bowen, set up a precise cross for captain Harry Kane . Kane's header was dramatically saved by goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic, hitting the bar in the 77th minute.Five minutes later, Jordan Pickford made a crucial save, tipping over a powerful shot from Vlahovic as Serbia maintained their pressure.Despite the onslaught, England's restructured defense, featuring the impressive Marc Guehi in his first major tournament and right-footed Kieran Trippier as a stand-in left back, managed to secure the win.Kane acknowledged the performance was not a classic by England. ""Overall a deserved win. It's just about getting through,"" said the England captain.""There was a spell in the second half where we got camped in our box and we found it hard to get out but it was an important win tonight.""England next play Denmark on Thursday after Serbia take on Slovenia.","Jude Bellingham's first-half header gave England a 1-0 victory over Serbia.

Concerns are also being raised about Babar Azam's captaincy. He was reinstated as skipper before the tournament.He had relinquished the captaincy following a poor ODI World Cup campaign last year.In a post-match press conference after the game against Ireland, Babar addressed the captaincy issue. He stated that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) would review the campaign at home and decide on the team's future leadership. Babar emphasized that his reinstatement as captain was a decision made solely by the PCB .""Jahaan tak captaani ki dekhe toh pahle maine chori toh mujhe laga ki ab nahi karni chahiye, toh maine chor di. Maine khud announce kiya tha. Wapas jab diya hai woh PCB ka faisla hai, unhone di hai. Ab hum jayenge, jitni bhi yahaan huwi hai baithke discussion karenge aur yeh faisla baad me.. Jab chorni hogi toh main aise hi khule aam bataunga, jo hoga saamne hoga. Filhaal ispe maine kuch socha nahi hai. Jo faisla hai woh PCB karegi,"" Babar said.Babar expressed his disappointment regarding the team’s early exit from the T20 World Cup. He acknowledged that the team as a whole failed to perform rather than pointing fingers at individual players. He noted that the team struggled to synchronize their performances; when the bowlers performed well, the batting lineup faltered.""Dukh jitna aap ko hai, usse jyada humein hai. Players, management sabko dukh hai. Hum waisi cricket nahi khel paaye, jaise expect karni chahiye thi. Jis tarah ke hamare players the, waise hum performance nahi kar paye.

Kabhi humne bowling me achcha kiya, kabhi humne batting me acha nahi kiya,"" Babar added.While discussing the conditions, Babar admitted that the pitches slightly favored fast bowlers, but the primary issue was their batting failures in critical moments. He pointed out that losing wickets back-to-back put them in a difficult position in crucial matches.""Yahaan par jo pitches thi who fast bowlers ko thoda sa help kar rahi thi. Humari batting waise click nahi kar payi. Jab humare hathon ki cheez aayi, wahan par humne wicket lose ki, jiske bajah se do crucial match the woh haare.

MIAMI: It's travel time. The American duty is over for India and now we're into what matters most --the Super-8 in the West Indies There wasn't everything perfect about the US leg - bad pitches, poor outfield, washed out game - but India didn't find it too tough to cross the first hurdle of the month-long marathon. Now it's Afghanistan , Bangladesh and Australia in Barbados, Antigua and St Lucia respectively. And with two teams going ahead from the group --Rohit Sharma's boys should be there in Guyana for the semifinal on June 27.With their last league game against Canada at Fort Lauderdale getting washed out without a ball being bowled, Team India players got a bit of time to put their feet up and relax. But with no practice also possible since their last match in New York on June 12, batting coach Vikram Rathour sounded a little worried.""This was of course not ideal. We would have preferred to build on the momentum and this was the game to express ourselves. But there's not much we can do about it,"" Rathour said.The Indian team will hit the nets in Barbados on June 17 to prepare for their game against Afghanistan --a team that has been in fine form so far. But much like India, they, too, haven't played in Barbados and will have to adapt to conditions. The England vs Australia game was played at the Kensington Oval where the Aussies had plundered 201 and then leggie Adam Zampa got 2/28 to become Man of the Match.Unlike Nassau County Ground in New York, where India played their three games, the Kensington Oval pitch should be batting-friendly and with no dew in the equation, the spinners, too, could come in handy.It's to be seen whether India stick to the four-pacer theory or drop Mohammed Siraj, whose form has been slightly up and down, and play Kuldeep Yadav as the third spinner. Rathour kept the options open when he said: ""We need to be a flexible team. We need to look at the conditions that are in front of us and be ready to deal with those. We'll react to what we get on that day and we have the resources to deal with any condition,"" Rathour said.Afghanistan, of course, is a team that banks heavily on spinners with Rashid Khan leading the line. Mohammed Nabi and Noor Ahmed are the two other spinners who should get the nod. All of them were part of the IPL and they know everything about bowling to the Indian batters.For India, it will be crucial that Virat Kohli , who had an indifferent USA leg with scores of 1,4 and 0, gets into the groove. Opening the batting, it could well be on Kohli to take the attack to the Afghan bowlers, and we might see him playing the slog sweep, a weapon that he has included in his arsenal to deal with the spin.Rathour insists that a ""hungrier"" Kohli, following his slight bad patch in New York, could be even more dangerous. ""I have absolutely no concern about his form. He batted superbly in the IPL and a couple of dismissals here doesn't change anything. Actually, it's good that he is a little hungrier, he is really keen to do well and really switched on,"" Rathour said.That should be music to the ears of all those fans who have been waiting for India to break a decade-long ICC title jinx. The signs so far aren't bad at all.",Team India will hit the nets in Barbados on June 17 to prepare for their game against Afghanistan.

T20 WORLD CUP:

|

MIAMI: These are two guys at two different ends of the spectrum. One's a phenomenal talent who is still lucky to be alive, let alone playing, while the other is an honest trier who keeps fighting.Rishabh Pant and Arshdeep Singh are two completely different personalities, but if you're to closely analyse India's United States leg of the T20 World Cup --they are the two stars who have gone slightly under the radar.Arshdeep, of course, has won a Man of the Match award with a spell of 4/9 against the United States, but Pant's contribution has almost going unnoticed. In all the three games that India won, the wicketkeeper-batter who is playing for India for the first time after his life-threatening injury late in 2022, played crucial knocks. 36 not out, 42 and 18 might not look huge, but if you put it in context, the importance becomes clearer.Pant is batting at No. 3, a position that is always reserved for the crème-de-la-crème of any batting line-up. And in New York, Pant came into bat when India lost the early wicket of Virat Kohli with virtually nothing on the board.The world knows Pant is a dynamite with the bat, but what made it special for him here was he wasn't always at his destructive best. Yet, the southpaw never went below run a ball, in fact his 31-ball 42 against Pakistan was probably the best batting effort on the New York minefield by any batter.Pant's promotion to the No. 3 spot was the product of a brain-wave of captain Rohit Sharma , who seems to have meticulously prepared for this T20 World Cup after the heartbreak of the ODI World Cup in India. ""The moment I saw Pant bat in the IPL, I knew where he would be batting in the World Cup,"" Rohit said in one of his press conferences. The decision was communicated to the wicketkeeper-batter early and the 26-year-old has gone out of his way to justify the captain's faith in him.In New York before the first game, on a practice pitch which everyone was avoiding due to its uneven nature, Pant asked the throwdown expert to test him with vicious short balls from less than 22 yards. Pant was getting hit on the body a few times, but you could see that the lion-hearted cricketer was trying to overcome fear.The team management was also looking to have the left-right combination going through the middle-order, something that Pant's promotion facilitates. In his decision to promote Pant to No. 3, Rohit is in fact looking forward to the West Indies leg as well, where he wants to use the dasher's counter-attacking abilities.""The kind of ability he has, it's always tough to find the right number for Pant. But with three right-handers in the top four, I thought it was nice to have him in the middle. And later on, in West Indies, when spin is going to play a big part, his counterattacking can come into picture in a big way. He has got an all-round game and we want to utilize that upfront, where he gets to play maximum balls along with some of the other experienced players,"" Rohit said.While Pant's batting is crucial to India's success going forward, Arshdeep's ability to swing the new ball and deliver the yorker at the death are equally important. The fact that he is also a left-armer adds the much-needed variety to the pace attack, which has three more right-armers.After doing well against Ireland, Arshdeep was entrusted to bowl the last over against Pakistan, where he did just enough to keep the desperate batters at bay. That was followed by his match-winning effort against USA and in all probability, if the team management decides to go with three specialist pacers in West Indies in the XI, he will be one of them.Arshdeep, though, doesn't want to think that far. ""I remember what (batting coach) Vikram Rathour told us in the team meeting - 'stay where your feet are'. So right now, we just stay in the present and prepare for that.""For now, the Super-8s are ""the present"" and Arshdeep would surely love to be at the top of his game at the Kensington Oval on Thursday.",Rishabh Pant and Arshdeep Singh have gone under the radar at T20 World Cup. Pant has been promoted to No. 3 in India's batting order. Singh has been playing for India for the first time since his life-threatening injury in 2022.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111048115,imgsize-65518,width-400,resizemode-4/111048115.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Under-fire Pakistan skipper Babar Azam on Sunday achieved a remarkable feat as he surpassed legendary MS Dhoni in the list of most run-getters as a captain in the history of the T20 World Cup during their match against Ireland in Lauderhill, United States.Riding on Babar's fighting unbeaten knock, Pakistan somehow managed to eke out a narrow three-wicket win in a low-scoring thriller. Despite chasing a paltry target of 107, Pakistan once again slumped to 62 for six in 11 overs. But skipper Babar (32 not out) and Abbas Afridi (17) shared a crucial 33-run stand to take them home at 111 for 7 in 18.5 overs.Already-eliminated from the race of Super 8, Pakistan concluded their T20 World Cup campaign with a third-place finish in Group A while arch-rivals India and co-hosts USA advanced to the next round, finishing at first and second positions respectively.Leading from the front, these captains have demonstrated remarkable skill and composure under pressure, etching their names into the history of the tournament with substantial run tallies.Pakistan's Babar stands atop this illustrious list, amassing 549 runs in just 17 innings. Known for his elegant stroke play and impeccable timing, Babar has consistently anchored his team’s innings, providing stability and a reliable scoring option.
