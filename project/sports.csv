"Chasoti students, teachers vow to resume classes ‘even under tree’ day after tehravi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chasoti-students-teachers-vow-to-resume-classes-even-under-tree-day-after-tehravi/articleshow/123477423.cms,"The video, recorded hours before the flood, shows Suman Devi, 11, rehearsing ‘Dharti’ on Aug 14 for the Independence Day event — something that didn’t happen.

CHASOTI (KISHTWAR): The poem began with a warning, a child’s voice — high-pitched, but intense — carrying through the govt-run Chasoti Middle School. The video, recorded hours before the flood, shows Suman Devi, 11, rehearsing ‘Dharti’ on Aug 14 for the Independence Day event — something that didn’t happen. Among the 14 villagers swept away was Arundhati Singh, 11, who studied in Kishtwar and stayed home rather than join school preparations. As the village prepares to observe ‘tehravi’ for their dead on Tuesday, the school’s four teachers and 50 students have resolved to resume classes the day after.In the 32-second video, Suman speaks about floods that remade lives in Mandi, Dharali, Kedarnath and Katra, her finger pointed, as if addressing not just her peers but the mountain. “Hey manav, sudhar ja, iss laalach ko chhod de; dharti maa ko samaj, prakriti se rishta jod de.” (O human, mend your ways. Cast off this greed. Honour Mother Earth and restore your bond with nature.)Her cadence rises: “Warna ye prakriti nahin ruk payegi, aur tu jhulas jaayega. Vilukt hote prajati ki hai lagegi.” (Or nature will not stop; you will be scorched. The curse of the vanishing species will descend, again and again upon you.)And then the final one, unblinking: “Phir tera number aayega. Tu bhi vilukt ho jaayega.” (Then it will be your turn. You, too, will vanish.)The morning of Aug 14 had been ordinary. Children were preparing for Independence Day skits — one group staging Operation Sindoor, others playing freedom fighters and soldiers. Bhagat Singh, British officers, soldiers, terrorists moved on cue, while Suman prepared her poem.Chasoti Middle School, 15 metres from the torrent’s path, has remained standing. Inside, everyone survived. That survival owed itself to timing. As it was a long break for Independence Day, Janmashtami and Rakshabandhan, children from Chasoti who study in other towns had returned home and were also called in to help prepare for the event. Arundhati was the only one who did not come.Every family in Chasoti was bereaved — a sibling gone, a grandparent lost, an aunt cremated, cousin missing. Each of the school’s four teachers carries grief. Hukam Chand Rathore, 45, the head teacher who wrote ‘Dharti’, had been in the courtyard when the flood struck; he lost his younger brother, sister-in-law and niece. Deva Ram, 52, mourns two sisters. Pavitra Singh, 31, lost an uncle. “Sometimes I think about those 15 metres,” said Rajendra Singh, 33, a teacher who lost his mother. He pressed his palms together as if measuring the distance. “That’s all it was. A few steps. But if the school still stands, then so must we. If we don’t gather again, the silence will break them.”In the evenings, the teachers sit on the cracked steps of the schoolhouse, planning how to reopen as its rooms remain occupied by rescue teams. Around them, the noise of 25 earthmovers has quietened as the day’s rescue work winds down, no longer interrupting conversation. Boots stacked in corners; supplies against walls. The timetable rewritten on scrap paper. “If there are no benches, we will sit on the ground,” Rathore told TOI. “If the building’s not cleared, we’ll use a courtyard. If that’s not safe, we’ll sit in someone’s home... even under a tree. What matters is that the children hear each other again.”The children, too, have begun speaking of little else. Anmol Singh, 11, kept his books close. “I want to study. I don’t want to waste this second chance,” he said. Makkhan Singh, 14, asked teachers if they could start early, even without uniforms or blackboards. His classmate Rashi Devi said she wanted to revise her lessons before school reopens. Bhawna Devi, 13, has returned each day to the edge of the school compound, waiting to learn again.","Chasoti Middle School, 15 metres from the torrent’s path, has remained standing.

"""They probably don’t need..."": Penguins icon Sidney Crosby gives Connor Bedard clear message that could define Canada’s future in global hockey",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/they-probably-dont-need-penguins-icon-sidney-crosby-gives-connor-bedard-clear-message-that-could-define-canadas-future-in-global-hockey/articleshow/123436832.cms,"Connor Bedard gets special message from Sidney Crosby as Team Canada eyes 2026 Winter Olympics (Getty Images)

Sidney Crosby inspires Canadian hockey team next generation



Canadian hockey future shaped by Crosby’s mentorship



As the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina is getting closer, Canadian hockey once again looks to its most reliable leader, Sidney Crosby. The Pittsburgh Penguins captain, celebrated for his game-winning goals and unmatched leadership, isn’t just gearing up for another shot at Olympic gold. He’s embracing a bigger responsibility: guiding Canada’s next generation of hockey stars, including phenom Connor Bedard, to carry forward the nation’s legacy on ice.Sidney Crosby has been more than just a player in the red and white jersey—he’s been the face of Canadian hockey for nearly two decades. From the golden goal in Vancouver 2010 to his steady presence in Sochi 2014, his contributions stretch far beyond scoring. What sets Crosby apart is his rare ability to connect with teammates of all ages. Veterans respect his consistency, while young players gravitate toward his mentorship.Speaking on the new wave of Canadian stars, Sidney Crosby offered humility and encouragement. “These guys are so ready now when they come in at such a young age, so they probably don’t need to hear much, but I’m here if they need it,” he said. For Bedard and others making their Olympic dreams a reality, having Crosby around means more than tactical guidance—it’s about learning the values of patience, composure, and leadership.The three-time Stanley Cup champion reflected on his own journey, saying, “I had guys who were really important in helping me adjust and, hopefully, accelerate my progress as best as possible. That’s part of playing a team sport. It’s a great thing about the game. Hopefully I can do the same.” His words reveal the cycle of mentorship that keeps Canadian hockey thriving across generations.The younger generation has already started voicing its gratitude. At the recent 4 Nations Face-Off tournament, Nathan MacKinnon credited Crosby as a steady influence in his career, noting, “He helped me a ton.” This acknowledgment highlights Crosby’s impact not only as a world-class athlete but as a cultural cornerstone in hockey.With Milan-Cortina 2026 approaching, Crosby’s presence guarantees that Canada won’t just compete for medals—it will continue shaping champions for decades to come. And, he will be watching the next gen.Meanwhile, contract talks between Connor Bedard and the Blackhawks aren’t urgent yet, though both sides aim for a long-term extension. With cap space available, the focus is on structuring the perfect eight-year deal, not rushing negotiations before Bedard’s third season.Also Read: Former Maple Leafs star reacts boldly to shocking trade rumors involving two of Auston Matthews’ teammates",Sidney Crosby has been the face of Canadian hockey for nearly two decades.

Serena Williams reveals weight loss journey with GLP-1 medication on Today show

“I literally tried everything. Running, walking, biking, stair-climber, you name it, I did it … Even now trying to play a professional sport, … I felt like, ‘OK, I don’t want to do this because it is a shortcut…’ But it actually isn’t.”

“If you’re on GLP-1s too, don’t let anybody tell you it’s the ‘easy way out.’ You’re not taking a shortcut, you’re taking care of yourself.”

“I feel light physically and light mentally … I can just do more. I’m more active. My joints don’t hurt as much.”

Serena Williams, the retired tennis legend, age 43, says she used a GLP-1 weight-loss medication to lose 31 pounds in eight months.

Poll Do you think Vanessa Bryant handled the pregnancy rumors well? Yes, very cleverly No, she should have addressed them directly

Met Gala Surprise: Rihanna Stuns With Baby Bump Reveal, A$AP Rocky Confirms It’s Baby No 3

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side— until now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Recently, Renaldo Wilson, the brother of WNBA star A’ja Wilson, has spoken out after a fake photo involving (who appears to be) Celtics forward Jaylen Brown and Vanessa Bryant started spreading online. The image, which many quickly realized was AI-generated, sparked a wave of unnecessary speculation. Renaldo stepped in to shut down the rumors and defend Vanessa from online trolls. In his response, Wilson reminded people that it has been nearly five years since Kobe and Gigi Bryant tragically passed away.He pointed out that the only reason the photo caused such a stir was because of Vanessa’s connection to Kobe, stressing that she is “human, just like everybody else.”Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Natalia Bryant stepped into the fashion world just like her mother, officially joining IMG Models in 2021 at the age of 18. “Ever since I can remember, I wanted to model,” she shared in a statement posted by IMG on Instagram. “There is a lot to learn, but I feel this is a great opportunity for me to learn and express myself creatively.”Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip. After the viral response via memes, Vanessa has seemingly closed the chapter as she did not extend the matter any further with any other comments about it afterwards.Days after shutting down the pregnancy rumor, Vanessa Bryant made a glowing courtside appearance with her daughters at the New York Liberty vs. Chicago Sky game. The WNBA shared a sweet clip showing Vanessa alongside Natalia, 22, Bianka, 8, and Capri, 5, all smiling and waving for the camera.Later, Vanessa uploaded an image of her in a restaurant, candidly posing as she waited for the food to be arrive. Considering the dress, it appears that the photograph was shot after her recent attendance in the game.Their family moment quickly caught fans’ attention online, adding a warm highlight to the evening. It was a rare and heartwarming public outing for the Bryant family, showing their strong support for women’s basketball. It was Vanessa's first public outing since she debunked the horrendous pregnancy rumors.Recently, Vanessa honored her husband Kobe's memory with a heartfelt Instagram post on Instagram, sharing a throwback photograph of the family with the NBA legend, ""Happy Fathers Day @kobebryant 💕 You are so missed. We love you so much. #GirlDad 💕💕""Earlier this July, Vanessa Bryant added another heartfelt moment to her social media with a birthday post for her sister, Sophie. The sweet throwback photo featured Vanessa, her late husband Kobe Bryant, and Sophie together, smiling during happier times. It comes after several touching family updates, including daughter Natalia’s recent USC graduation and emotional tribute to her dad.As for her fortune, Vanessa's net worth has seen major growth over the years. While Kobe Bryant’s NBA success helped build their fortune, Vanessa carved her own path, too. She’s earned recognition as a model, businesswoman, and philanthropist, adding to her wealth through years of steady work.As of 2025, her estimated net worth is $600 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. A large portion of that came from Kobe’s estate, after his tragic passing in 2020. At the time, Forbes valued the Lakers legend’s net worth at $600 million.Vanessa Bryant just shared a sweet throwback-inspired moment that melted hearts online. Her youngest daughter, Capri, recreated one of Kobe Bryant’s most iconic photos from 1999—wearing a cast and pajamas just like her dad did after a wrist injury. Vanessa captioned the photo, “Like father, like daughter. 💜 Capri Kobe Bryant 💜 #BabyMamba #KokoBean 💜💛🐍,” reminding fans how Kobe’s spirit lives on through their kids. From raising her children to keeping Kobe's memory alive, Vanessa has been an example of love and a remarkable parent. Also, there is no report of her seeing anyone as she remains loyal to her beloved husband Kobe, cherishing his legacy with their kids.Vanessa Bryant’s newest tribute arrives just months after she shared memories from a snowy holiday getaway with her daughters. Last December, she posted sweet moments on Instagram— showing the girls toasting marshmallows and skiing through the snow. Little Capri even shared a carousel ride with Vanessa, making the winter trip extra special.Additionally, Vanessa Bryant also grabs headlines for her friendship with several celebrities including Ciara, she often comments and likes the posts of her friends on social media. As of now, Vanessa is keeping a low profile about her personal life like always.Recently, Vanessa Bryant touched hearts with a heartfelt tribute to Kobe Bryant, joined by daughters Natalia, Bianka, and Capri during the Dodgers’ Bobblehead Night. She shared sweet photos from the emotional occasion, and her Instagram post celebrating Kobe Bryant’s legacy quickly drew an outpouring of love from fans. Certainly, Vanessa has been a proud mother with strong bonding with her kids.Recently, They partnered with @baby2baby and their Angel, @vanessabryant, to take part in a special Back-to-School Celebration for the incredible students of Ninth Street Elementary in Los Angeles. Each student received Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation gear along with Kobe sneakers — a perfect way to kick off the new school year and fall sports season.Also Read: Is Vanessa Bryant pregnant with her 5th child?

Benin’s citizenship program seeks to heal history and strengthen ties with the Black diaspora

From memorial tourism to a personal journey of heritage

Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin through a groundbreaking initiative aimed at reconnecting descendants of enslaved Africans with their ancestral homeland. The ceremony took place on July 26 in Cotonou, marking a symbolic moment for both the artist and the West African nation.Justice Minister Yvon Détchénou described the program as a step toward repairing deep historical wounds. “By legally recognizing these children of Africa, Benin is healing a historical wound. It is an act of justice, but also one of belonging and hope,” he said during the event.In September, Benin passed a law granting citizenship to people over 18 who can prove their lineage to victims of the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa, provided they do not already hold citizenship from another African nation. Applicants can submit DNA reports, authenticated testimonies, or historical family records.To streamline the process, the government launched a digital platform, My Afro Origins, allowing descendants worldwide to apply. While other African nations have opened similar pathways, Benin’s efforts carry profound weight due to its significant role in the slave trade. An estimated 1.5 million people were taken from the Bight of Benin region—modern-day Benin, Togo, and parts of Nigeria—by European traders, often with the involvement of local kingdoms.Benin has openly acknowledged its part in the slave trade, hosting conferences since the 1990s and issuing formal apologies. Today, the country invests heavily in “memorial tourism,” with historical sites like the Slave Route and the haunting Door of No Return in Ouidah serving as powerful reminders of the past.After receiving her citizenship, Ciara walked these historic paths, reflecting on their significance. “Between emotion, reflection and heritage, I experienced a profound return to what truly matters,” she shared.Benin’s coastline, once part of the historic “Slave Coast,” was a major hub in the transatlantic slave trade. From 1580 to 1727, the Kingdom of Whydah, located along today’s Benin coast, exported over a million enslaved Africans to the Americas, including the U.S., the Caribbean, and Brazil.Also Read: “Rhyme with betrayal”: Blake Lively fears friendship fallout with Taylor Swift could go public as Travis Kelce gets dragged into the drama Best known for hits like “Goodies” and “Level Up”, Ciara’s journey is more than a personal milestone—it’s a symbol of reconnection between Africa and its diaspora, inspiring others to explore their roots while acknowledging the complex history that shaped them.Russell Wilson's wife Ciara has also been credited with elevating the standard of dance, choreography, and visual art in her respective generation, and is regarded as an icon within the fields of dance, entertainment, and R&B for her contributions.In her acting career, she has appeared in the films All You've Got (2006), Mama, I Want to Sing! (2012), That's My Boy (2012), and the television series The Game (2013). Ciara starred in the 2023 remake of The Color Purple as Nettie. Ciara has received multiple accolades, including a Grammy Award, two BET Awards, the Woman of the Year award from Billboard Women in Music, two MTV Video Music Awards, eight Soul Train Awards, and fifteen Ascap Music Awards. As of 2019, Ciara has sold over 45 million records worldwide.On the other side, Wilson was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2020 and was the recipient of the Bart Starr Award in 2022. Wilson is also part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won MLS Cup 2019 and the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League.Russell Wilson and Ciara exchanged vows during a secret, secluded wedding ceremony at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England on July 6, 2016. Attendees consisted of their closest family and friends, including Kelly Rowland, Jennifer Hudson, and La La Anthony.

While India will not participate in bilateral sports with Pakistan, they will continue to play in multi-nation tournaments.""I think we are very clear that whenever talks are held, it will be on an equal footing with India, and there will be no more begging for negotiations.

Pakistan squad:

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) stunned many when it announced its 17-member squad for the upcoming UAE tri-series and Asia Cup 2025 without star batters Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan. Amid the speculation, PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi has clarified that the decision was purely the work of selectors.“First of all, I don’t have even 1% role in putting players into the team or taking them out,” Naqvi told reporters on Saturday.“We have a selection committee and then an advisory body, they all sit together. The process goes through a lot — discussions that last 8–10 hours, sometimes for 2–3 days. Definitely, if a team is being selected, it’s in good hands, all professionals are there. I’ve only told them one thing — whatever decision they take, it should be on merit, and I will support that.”The Asia Cup squad sees a greater emphasis on power-hitters, with Saim Ayub, Sahibzada Farhan and Fakhar Zaman expected to shoulder the top-order responsibility. Neither Babar nor Rizwan has featured in a T20 international since December 2024.Naqvi underlined the long-term vision, adding, “With whatever lot was available, I polished it and carried it forward. Now our effort is to bring in as many new players as possible so that there is more competition in cricket and the best of the best can come forward.”Head coach Mike Hesson, meanwhile, elaborated on the call, saying Babar had been asked to improve “in some areas” including his strike rate and play against spin.“At the moment, the players that we have, (they) have performed exceptionally well,” Hesson had said. “But certainly a player like Babar has an opportunity to play in the BBL and start to show that he’s improving in those areas in T20s. He’s too good a player for us not to consider.”Salman Ali Agha will captain Pakistan in the tri-series and Asia Cup, with senior names like Shaheen Afridi, Haris Rauf and Hasan Ali joined by promising youngsters Hasan Nawaz and Mohammad Haris.Salman Ali Agha (c), Abrar Ahmed, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Hasan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Haris (wk), Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Waseem Jnr, Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Salman Mirza, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Sufyan Moqim.",Pakistan announce 17-member squad for upcoming UAE tri-series and Asia Cup 2025.

Yuzvendra Chahal Explains His Viral 'Be Your Own Sugar Daddy' T‑Shirt

NEW DELHI: India spinner Yuzvendra Chahal and choreographer-actor Dhanashree Verma’s separation has remained in the public spotlight months after their divorce was finalised. While both have opened up about their journey in parts — first Chahal in a podcast and later Dhanashree in her own candid conversation — the latest development has seen an unexpected voice of support emerging from within Indian cricket circles. Suryakumar Yadav ’s wife, Devisha Shetty, publicly extended her solidarity with Dhanashree after the latter shared her experiences on the podcast ‘Humans of Bombay’. In an Instagram story that soon gained traction on social media, Devisha posted a picture of Dhanashree from the interview, captioning it: “So much respect and love for you.”The message struck a chord, with many praising Devisha for standing by her friend. Both women were often spotted together at matches during Chahal’s time in the Indian side and Suryakumar’s ongoing stint with the T20I team.Dhanashree, who finalised her divorce in March, had described the moment of separation as overwhelming. “I genuinely feel that the day it actually happened, it was very emotional for me and my family. I still remember when I was standing there and the verdict was about to be given… I literally started howling and crying in front of everybody,” she recalled on the podcast.She also revealed how the aftermath unfolded in front of the media glare.“He walked out first, that whole thing happened with the T-shirt and media, and I wasn’t aware about it because I was still inside. I got out from the back gate… I sat in the car, my best friend was there with me, and we were still trying to grasp our breath. It was that shaky moment, especially when you know people will blame you only.”Yuzvendra Chahal, a limited overs specialist, has not played for India since August 2023. His last appearance came against the West Indies in a T20I in Lauderhill, USA. His last showing in an ODI was further back that year, in June, against New Zealand. Chahal had been part of India's T20 World Cup-winning squad in 2024 but didn't feature in any fixture.","India spinner Yuzvendra Chahal and choreographer-actor Dhanashree Verma's separation has remained in the public spotlight months after their divorce was finalised.

Shilo Sanders ejected after throwing punch in Buccaneers’ preseason game



Sons of Coach Prime endure tough weekend



The preseason often serves as a proving ground for rookies hoping to carve out a place in the NFL. For Shilo Sanders, that opportunity may have slipped through his hands on Saturday night. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers rookie safety was ejected in the second quarter against the Buffalo Bills, an incident that could weigh heavily as roster decisions loom in the coming days.Shilo Sanders, the son of Hall of Fame cornerback Deion Sanders, entered camp with high expectations but little margin for error. Having gone undrafted out of Colorado, he was already in a crowded competition behind Antoine Winfield Jr. and several other safeties on the depth chart. A strong preseason debut hinted at promise, yet the latest display of frustration may hurt his chances.The flashpoint came when Buffalo tight end Zach Davidson locked up with Sanders downfield after a short completion. The two exchanged shoves before Sanders, visibly frustrated, threw a punch that connected with Davidson’s helmet. Officials wasted no time: a flag for unnecessary roughness and an ejection followed, sending the rookie to the locker room.One play later, Buffalo found the end zone, magnifying the costly lapse.Sanders’ stat line across the preseason—three total tackles—was modest but serviceable for someone fighting from the bottom of the roster. Unfortunately, discipline matters as much as production for fringe players, and this moment will likely be a focal point in the coaches’ evaluation.It wasn’t just Shilo having a difficult day. His younger brother, Shedeur Sanders, struggled in his own preseason outing with the Cleveland Browns, completing just 3 of 6 passes for 14 yards while enduring five sacks. For both brothers, the final weeks of training camp now bring uncertainty about whether they will be part of an active roster when the regular season begins.Shilo Sanders’ NFL dream is far from over, but the timing of his mistake couldn’t have been worse. With Tampa Bay’s roster cuts imminent, his future hangs in the balance, and the coming days will reveal whether his journey continues in pewter and red—or takes a detour elsewhere.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders finally explains his reaction after being subbed out late against Rams in preseason finale","Tampa Bay Buccaneers rookie safety Shilo Sanders was ejected in the second quarter against the Buffalo Bills.

Rob Gronkowski hails Jack Brady as “more beastly”



Gisele Bündchen shares new mom glow



Tom Brady marked a milestone that made fans feel the passage of time just as much as he did. The NFL legend, who turned 48 earlier this month, now finds himself the proud father of an adult. His eldest son, John Edward Thomas Moynahan—known to the world as Jack—celebrated his 18th birthday, and Brady’s emotional tribute captured both his pride and gratitude.For a man whose name is synonymous with discipline, competitiveness, and success, Brady’s softer side came alive on Instagram. “You have shown the world what it means to be gracious, courageous, and kind,” he wrote, adding that his heart was overflowing with pride. He reminded Jack that adulthood brings new challenges but celebrated the young man he’s becoming.The bond between father and son extends beyond words. Just before Jack’s birthday, the duo shared a golf outing where Brady proudly showcased his Nobull gear. Yet the spotlight shifted to Jack, who stood taller and carried a rugged presence beside his dad.The photos stirred reactions, and none was as playful as Rob Gronkowski’s.“Jack looked way more beastly than Brady himself,” the former tight end quipped, reminding fans that Brady’s legacy is living on in more ways than one.While Brady reflected on fatherhood, Gisele Bündchen chose a different lens to celebrate life. The supermodel, now 45, has embraced a new chapter with her boyfriend, Joaquim Valente. She recently welcomed a baby boy with him in February, and her latest Instagram post radiated joy. “Thank you, summer, you’ve been so good to us! Obrigada, verão, você foi tão bom conosco,” she captioned, alongside idyllic snapshots of vacations and family moments.The pictures showed Gisele holding her seven-month-old close, glowing with the happiness of new motherhood. Her older children, Benjamin, 15, and Vivian, 12, were also featured in the post, reflecting the blended realities of her family with Brady. Her life now blends co-parenting with raising a newborn, offering fans a rare glimpse of resilience and renewal after her 2022 divorce from the NFL icon.Between Brady’s heartfelt tribute to Jack and Gisele’s tender portraits of her baby, one truth stood clear: both continue to celebrate family in their own way, while the world watches the next generation of the Brady-Bündchen story unfold.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s secretive feature film leaves fans guessing — and why Travis Kelce won’t be in it","Tom Brady celebrated his son Jack's 18th birthday with a heartfelt Instagram post.

It’s not every day that professional football players get caught up in a teenage love triangle debate, but the Kansas City Chiefs found themselves going viral for doing just that. In a lighthearted locker room moment, Chiefs players were asked to pick sides in the popular Amazon Prime series The Summer I Turned Pretty — choosing between Team Conrad and Team Jeremiah.The clip, shared by the Chiefs’ official account and amplified by @_MLFootball, quickly made the rounds on social media. While the players are usually grilled about game plans and rival defenses, this time the questions were all about which fictional boyfriend they’d back.One answer, in particular, stole the spotlight: “My wife would be mad if I said Jeremiah… so Conrad.” The response had fans cracking up online, with many noting how carefully players balanced humor with domestic diplomacy. The emojis that followed — 💀💀💀 — summed up just how funny the moment was to viewers.What stood out most about the viral exchange was how human it made the players appear. Instead of breaking down defensive schemes or Patrick Mahomes ’ passing options, the Chiefs were suddenly no different from any group of friends caught up in a binge-worthy drama.Fans quickly chimed in, with some shocked that NFL players even had strong opinions on The Summer I Turned Pretty.

has long been a fan-favorite on the basketball court with his unmatched skills. But in the summer of 2025, the Los Angeles Lakers superstar became the subject of lighthearted trolling - not for his jump shot or highlight-reel dunks, but for his “stiff” golf swing that quickly went viral and drew reactions from NFL legends, NBA peers, and fans alike.During the NBA offseason, LeBron James began exploring golf as a new hobby, often playing alongside his son Bronny James. He documented his early attempts on social media, posting videos of his tee shots. In one clip, he admitted, “Day 2 of trying this! Boy oh boy, it’s a mind f**k to say the least! But I really love that part - humbling!”Despite his excitement, the footage revealed a swing that reminded many of Charles Barkley’s famously awkward form. With stiff shoulders, minimal wrist action, and a rigid motion, LeBron’s golf swing became an instant talking point online.The viral videos caught the attention of NFL Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe, former wide receiver Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson, and ex-NBA star Joe Johnson, who dissected LeBron James’ form on their popular show Nightcap.Shannon Sharpe joked about James’ “robotic” shoulder movement, while Chad Johnson quipped, “Bronny should’ve booked his dad a lesson instead of just bringing him to the course.”Joe Johnson offered encouragement, saying, “He’s going to be alright, though. Just keep working.”The consensus: LeBron’s swing was comically stiff, but with practice, he could improve.The fun didn’t stop with NFL legends. Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry, an avid golfer, joined in by posting a hilarious impersonation of LeBron’s follow-through. Curry welcomed him to the sport, joking, “The game needs you, big fella.”PGA Tour pro Jordan Spieth analyzed LeBron’s swing more seriously, pointing out his “lack of wrist flexibility and limited backswing.” Still, Spieth was optimistic, saying LeBron could “add 30 yards in 30 minutes” with the right adjustments.Fans piled on with memes, calling LeBron’s form a “visual headache” and joking about whether he even knew where the ball landed.Despite the trolling, LeBron James took the jokes in stride. He described golf as “addictive” and vowed to keep practicing, rain or shine. His persistence drew support from NBA stars like Jayson Tatum and pro golfer Min Woo Lee, who praised his willingness to step out of his comfort zone.True to his reputation, LeBron approached golf with the same relentless mindset he brings to basketball: a commitment to learning, grinding, and eventually mastering the challenge.This viral golf saga struck a chord because it showed a rare, vulnerable side of one of the world’s greatest athletes. Watching LeBron struggle - and laugh at himself - made him more relatable, while also sparking a fun crossover between basketball, football, and golf communities.As LeBron himself summed up: “You gotta fall in love with the game.

has offered an optimistic update on his recovery from the devastating Achilles tendon injury he suffered during Game 7 of the 2025 NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The injury, which required surgery, has ruled him out for the entire 2025-26 season, but Haliburton’s steady progress has Indiana Pacers fans hopeful for his long-term return.Speaking to reporters in late August, the 25-year-old guard revealed that he is hitting new milestones in his rehab. “I’m walking now in my boot,” Haliburton shared, via Tony East. “Getting closer to walking full time in my shoe. So that’s exciting for me. It’s kind of like a new benchmark, a new achievement for me… Just being able to walk; it’s like the small wins right now. Just taking it a day at a time. I have good days, bad days. ”He also emphasized the mental side of the journey: “Yeah, things are going well… Same treatment, same stuff every day. But falling in love with the grind of that. Just trying to get as well as I can as fast as I can.”Tyrese Haliburton described his progress as a series of “small wins,” acknowledging that the recovery process comes with highs and lows.Despite the daily grind, he remains encouraged by the direction things are moving.The Indiana Pacers have officially ruled Haliburton out for the 2025-26 campaign, understanding the severity of Achilles injuries, which often require 10 to 12 months of healing. Haliburton himself has echoed this cautious stance.“I want to be at 100 percent; I don’t want to come back at 85 or 90 percent,” he said, stressing that a full recovery is his only priority.Haliburton, who turns 26 in February, still has plenty of prime years ahead. While his absence will leave a major gap in Indiana’s rotation, the Pacers are focused on ensuring he returns fully healthy and ready to resume his leadership role. Tyrese Haliburton ’s injury came at a heartbreaking moment for Indiana, which fell to the Thunder in a grueling Game 7 of the Finals. The guard had been instrumental during the playoff run, averaging nearly 19 points and over nine assists per game while contributing across the board in rebounds and steals.Without him, the Indiana Pacers face a challenging 2025-26 season. President of basketball operations Kevin Pritchard has expressed confidence in Haliburton’s eventual return, saying the team will not jeopardize his long-term health for short-term success.Haliburton has leaned on both teammates and fellow athletes during his recovery.

Why does a LeBron James trade to the Golden State Warriors remain a long shot despite interest?

According to reports, the Golden State Warriors have contacted the Los Angeles Lakers several times in the last few months to discuss potential trade options for LeBron James . The talk for the potential trade, that would link LeBron with two-time MVP Stephen Curry, has been ongoing for the past 18 months. It validates what many have suspected, that the G.S. Warriors have long been interested in bringing together two generational superstars, even though nothing has been concluded yet.It has emerged that LeBron James has been under close observation by the Golden State Warriors. In February 2024, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski and Ramona Shelburne broke news that the team had called the L.A. Lakers about trading the legend. However, Rich Paul , LeBron James' agent, informed Golden State that he had no interest in being transferred.On the other hand, NBA insider Jake Fischer claimed that for the previous 18 months, the Golden State Warriors had contacted the Los Angeles Lakers to discuss trade options that might match LeBron with two-time MVP Stephen Curry He further wrote:“I’m told that the Warriors have called the Lakers on multiple occasions over the past 18 months to see whether there is any trade pathway to pairing [LeBron] James with Stephen Curry, who roughly a year ago at this time was teaming with LeBron for the United States senior men’s national team on its run to a gold medal at the Paris Olympics.""Despite their longstanding rivalry on the field, which dates back to four consecutive NBA Finals between LeBron James' Cleveland Cavaliers and Stephen Curry's Golden State Warriors from 2015 to 2018, the icons recently got the opportunity to work together for the first time.What the G.S. Warriors were offering the L.A. Lakers is unknown, but it was obviously insufficient to initiate a transfer.NBA insider Jake Fischer reported that the Golden State Warriors are still considering matching up LeBron James with long-time standout Stephen Curry. LeBron James still has a contract with the L.A. Lakers despite Golden State's constant calls.Being one of the most powerful people in the NBA guarantees that any conversation about his future is directly related to his openness to talks. He has indicated no desire to leave Los Angeles up to now, nor have his agents.Meanwhile, Golden State's ongoing bids to maximize its championship window with Stephen Curry are evidenced by their pursuit of LeBron James. As the NBA's new season draws closer, the Los Angeles Lakers ' decision to keep the legend and team him up with Luka Doncic signals their own attempt to win another championship.Also read: Luka Doncic wants LeBron James to finish his career with Los Angeles Lakers despite growing tensions","Golden State Warriors expressed interest in pairing LeBron James with Stephen Curry in trade talks with Los Angeles Lakers.

Elliotte Friedman’s assurance on Kyle Dubas’ future with the Penguins

NHL Update From Europe | 32 Thoughts

Why ownership changes won’t disrupt team direction



The Pittsburgh Penguins have been the subject of heated speculation in recent weeks as reports of a potential ownership shakeup gained steam. Fenway Sports Group, which purchased the franchise in 2021, is reportedly exploring selling a minority stake to new investors. With names like the Florida-based Hoffmann Family of Companies and even former owner Mario Lemieux surfacing in rumors, fans have wondered what the ripple effects could mean for hockey operations. Chief among those concerns was the future of general manager and president of hockey operations, Kyle Dubas.On his 32 Thoughts podcast, NHL insider Elliotte Friedman directly addressed the rumors and sought to calm the speculation. “I don't know when they (Hoffmann Family) came in, but, like I wrote on Monday, they're very serious about it,” Friedman said. Despite that seriousness, he emphasized that any ownership adjustments will not impact Dubas’ job. “I don't think this will affect Dubas at all. I think he's going to stay on in his current roles. ”Dubas joined Pittsburgh in 2023 after leaving the Toronto Maple Leafs, and has since reshaped the Penguins’ front office.His role has been pivotal as the franchise looks to rebuild competitiveness while managing the tail end of Sidney Crosby’s legendary career.While sales and valuation chatter can rattle fan bases, Friedman made it clear he doesn’t see a change in direction. “Do you think it'll change the direction of the team? … There's nothing I've heard in the days since this first came out that convinces me that their plan is changing,” he explained.Also Read: Mikko Rantanen’s military service delay sparks legal case in Finland amid career-high season For Penguins fans, the takeaway is simple: while ownership structures may evolve, Dubas’ hockey blueprint remains firmly in place.","The Pittsburgh Penguins have been the subject of heated speculation in recent weeks as reports of a potential ownership shakeup gained steam.

Antonio Brown mocked Diddy but fans quickly turned the spotlight back on him

Social media backlash revealed the hypocrisy in Antonio Brown’s trolling



In 2024, former NFL star Antonio Brown once again found himself in the middle of controversy, not because of his play on the field but because of his behavior online. Known for his unfiltered presence on social media and his provocatively named podcast “CTESPN,” Brown often positioned himself as a cultural commentator. But when he tried to take aim at hip-hop mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs during Combs’ wave of legal troubles, the move spectacularly backfired.After footage from 2016 resurfaced showing Combs assaulting Cassie Ventura, Brown jumped into the conversation by uploading a Photoshopped image on X. The post showed Diddy’s face pasted onto Cuba Gooding Jr.’s body from his 2019 arrest, with Brown declaring that if the LAPD wouldn’t act due to the statute of limitations, then “Detective AB” would “finish the job.”The internet, however, was quick to remind him of his own legal baggage. Fans pointed out his 2021 sexual assault settlement with a former trainer, alongside years of legal disputes, arrests, and child-support issues. Many felt Brown had no standing to call out others when his own track record was littered with allegations and run-ins with the law.What Brown framed as a moment of accountability for Diddy was largely seen as opportunistic and hypocritical. Critics argued that his trolling wasn’t about justice but about drawing attention to himself, at the cost of reminding everyone of his own turbulent downfall after leaving the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2018.Also Read: Stephen A.

While fellow rookie Gabriel received extended reps in Week 2, Sanders was held out after suffering his oblique issue in practice.

Bill Gates reveals his winning answer to ‘why should we hire you’ to crack any interview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-reveals-his-winning-answer-to-why-should-we-hire-you-to-crack-any-interview/articleshow/123405257.cms,"

Bill Gates answers why should we hire you?

What are your strengths and weaknesses?





Where do you see yourself in five years?



What are your salary expectations?







Bill Gates’ final advice

When it comes to cracking a job interview, even the brightest candidates often stumble on the most common questions. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates , who has not only given interviews in his youth but also conducted countless ones as an employer, recently shared how to approach some of the trickiest questions that appear in almost every interview. Gates believes that while technical skills matter, the way candidates express their motivation, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities makes a lasting impression. His advice offers a mix of honesty, preparation, and strategic thinking that can help job seekers stand out in today’s highly competitive hiring environment.Gates emphasizes that this question isn’t about boasting but about clearly communicating your value in a way that resonates with the employer. He explains that hiring managers are not just looking for a list of accomplishments – they want to see how your skills and mindset directly align with the company’s mission and challenges. Instead of giving vague responses like “I work hard” or “I’m a team player,” Gates suggests tailoring your answer to highlight the exact strengths the employer is seeking. For example, if the role demands innovation, a candidate could describe a time when they creatively solved a difficult problem and how that approach could benefit the company.As an example, Gates himself often pointed to his coding achievements, deep passion for software, teamwork skills, and ambition when answering this question during his early career. By showcasing not only what he had already accomplished but also his enthusiasm and hunger to grow, he left interviewers convinced of his long-term potential. He advises modern candidates to take a similar approach: connect your unique skills directly to the company’s needs, show you are motivated to grow with the role, and position yourself as someone who can contribute to both short-term impact and long-term vision.According to Gates, this question is an opportunity for self-awareness rather than self-promotion. He recommends that candidates choose strengths that are relevant to the job while explaining how those qualities have produced real results in the past. On weaknesses, Gates suggests honesty balanced with growth – admitting areas of improvement while showing the steps you are taking to overcome them. This demonstrates maturity and a willingness to learn, qualities employers value highly.Bill Gates’ own answer: Gates admitted that he was not particularly skilled in marketing or sales, but he excelled in product creation and defining features. By acknowledging weaknesses without trying to disguise them, while doubling down on his true strengths, Gates showed the kind of critical self-awareness employers value.Gates points out that this question is less about predicting the future and more about revealing ambition. Employers want to see that candidates have direction and drive. He suggests aligning your career goals with the company’s growth, showing that you want to grow alongside the organization. Even if the long-term vision evolves, demonstrating that you think ahead and are motivated to build a future leaves a strong impression.On this tricky question, Gates advises candidates to strike a balance between confidence and flexibility. Being too rigid about salary can make you seem difficult to work with, while undervaluing yourself may raise doubts about your worth. Gates recommends doing prior research on industry standards and giving a reasonable range instead of a fixed number. He also stresses framing salary discussions in terms of value – how your skills and contributions justify the compensation – while showing openness to negotiation. This demonstrates professionalism and practicality, traits employers respect. In today’s fast-changing job market, Gates’ timeless advice highlights that authenticity, preparation, and adaptability are key. For candidates, mastering these principles can mean the difference between just attending an interview and truly acing it.For Gates, interviews are not just about answering questions but about telling a story – one that highlights your passion, your potential, and your fit with the company’s culture. He encourages candidates to prepare, practice, and remain authentic, reminding them that the goal is not perfection but connection. By framing common questions as opportunities to reveal character and ambition, Gates believes any candidate can turn a stressful interview into a powerful career breakthrough. Gates reminds candidates that confidence paired with curiosity often leaves a stronger impression than rehearsed answers. Embracing challenges and demonstrating adaptability can set you apart in any competitive interview. Gates believes that the candidates who succeed are those who combine skills with purpose, showing not just what they can do but why they want to do it.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates recently shared how to approach some of the trickiest questions that appear in almost every interview.

A short look at Evander Kane’s Vancouver journey



Evander Kane, a Vancouver Canucks forward, has in recent times gained attention for reasons unrelated to hockey. This 33-year-old athlete showed his fiancée, Mara Teigen, on her birthday that she was cherished, via an Instagram tribute. A person with so much intensity on the ice showed a softer side by honouring not just his partner but the family that they have built together. His posts spoke of love, appreciation, togetherness and offered a peek into his personal life away from the rink.For Mara Teigen's big day, Evander Kane decorated Instagram with two story posts. The first one showed a radiant photo of Mara along with the heartwarming message: ""Happy birthday Mara Teigen. We all love you very much,"" followed by several affectionate emojis. His second post showed the couple enjoying wine in a cozy café, gazing warmly into each other's eyes—a picture of sheer contentment.Mara also gave an account of the preparations, beginning with an all-night party accompanied by children. Balloons spelling “Mom” filled the room, complemented by a coffee mug reading “best mom ever.” Hendrix stood tall, holding a big heart-shaped balloon, as Mara narrated about her little ones being her “best friends.”With the day coming to a close, she posted glowing photos of herself with the kids, with the house having been warmed by love.The posts mirrored the couple's synergy, with Mara focusing on motherhood while Kane channelled his love for her; together they wove a story that is far from a mere birthday tribute, instead indicative of family togetherness and shared joy.Kane's celebration coincides with the deal that made him a member of the Vancouver Canucks. The move is special given that he grew up in the city, getting in-game time before the families and friends. He is itching to spend time on the ice rink contributing, but more importantly, he wants to spend some quality time with his family.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's legacy faces a new debate after Frank Nazar’s mega deal Evander Kane's heartfelt birthday tribute to Mara Teigen went much farther than mere wishes and conveying love, esteem, and family unity.

Mitchell Tinsley’s case for Joe Burrow and the Bengals’ WR duo



Why analysts say Cincinnati is risking Joe Burrow’s prime



TMZ Sports caught Cincinnati Bengals wideout Mitchell Tinsley ahead of Saturday’s preseason finale against the Indianapolis Colts. The preseason riser did not hesitate when asked about Joe Burrow ’s place among quarterbacks, and his words turned heads. As final roster cuts approach Tuesday at 1 p.m. PT (4 p.m. ET), Tinsley’s comments frame both his own rise and a bigger question around how Cincinnati is building around its franchise QB.As per TMZ Sports, Tinsley praised Burrow without qualification. “He’s the best quarterback in the league and I get to practice and play with him in games,” Tinsley said. “It’s really awesome to build chemistry with him on and off the field. He’s one of those guys, he’s so smart, so intelligent. It’s awesome being out there with him.”Tinsley also pointed to the standard set by Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, and how that accelerates his development. “It’s a lot of fun. To go out there and [go] ‘Okay, how did [Ja’Marr] run that route or how did Tee run that route.’ Add things to your tool bank. At the end of the day, it’s all about getting better. Iron sharpens iron.”The wide receiver is pushing to make the 53-man roster with the league’s cut deadline on Tuesday.He said he is focused on what comes next, not last week’s breakout, and kept the lens on improvement, as per TMZ Sports.A separate debate continues around Cincinnati’s roster construction and defensive trajectory. Former safety Ryan Clark argued that some roster strain traces back to Burrow’s influence on keeping elite weapons together, which concentrated spending at wide receiver while making defensive upgrades harder, as per Ryan Clark. The logic: paying Tee Higgins at a near–WR1 level and preparing for Ja’Marr Chase’s top-of-market value compresses flexibility elsewhere.Stephen A. Smith took a different tack, placing the responsibility on the franchise, not Burrow. Smith’s view is that Cincinnati has not supplied even an average defense often enough, and that Burrow does not need a Chiefs-level unit to contend, as per Stephen A. Smith.Contract dynamics add friction. The Trey Hendrickson situation remains a flashpoint over guarantees and structure going forward. On “The Dan Patrick Show,” former lineman Mark Schlereth criticized the broader philosophy. “Listen, Trey Hendrickson is a phenomenal football player. Love watching him play. But in Cincinnati, the one thing they want to do is they want to sit back in shotgun and throw the football… their offensive coordinator came out this offseason and said, ‘Hey, we just got to outscore people. ’ And I thought to myself, how’d that work for you last year? It’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard,” Schlereth said, as per “The Dan Patrick Show.”He connected that approach back to Burrow’s workload. “They’re wasting Joe Burrow because they basically make him play the entirety of four quarters on a high dive… it’s all on Joe Burrow 24/7 in Cincinnati. So whether they sign Hendrickson or not, that’s not going to change the philosophy of how they play.”The takeaway across those viewpoints: if resources and philosophy tilt too far toward outscoring opponents, even strong edge play or splash additions may not change outcomes. The onus is on Cincinnati to balance its passing-game identity with a defense that can hold the line when Burrow and the offense inevitably hit stretches where drives stall.",Cincinnati Bengals wideout Mitchell Tinsley praised quarterback Joe Burrow without qualification.

Poll Will Ronaldo ever win a major trophy with Al-Nassr? Yes, definitely No, I don't think so

Cristiano Ronaldo ’s hunt for a major trophy with Al-Nassr continues after his side fell short in the Saudi Super Cup final, losing to Al-Ahli on penalties following a 2-2 draw in normal time.The Portuguese star is now winless in three domestic finals since moving to Saudi Arabia. Despite his milestone goal on the night, the team once again finished on the losing side.The 2023-24 King's Cup, the 2024 Super Cup, and now the 2025 edition are the three finals that the superstar has failed to clinch victory after signing for the Saudi club bac at the start of January.Al-Nassr started brightly, pressing hard in search of an early breakthrough. Ronaldo himself went close with an overhead attempt, while Wesley and Felix also tested goalkeeper Edouard Mendy. Their persistence paid off late in the first half when Ronaldo converted from the spot after Ali Majrashi was penalised for handball.But parity was quickly restored as Franck Kessie struck a precise effort from the edge of the box. The contest swung again in the second half when Marcelo Brozovic punished a mistake from Kessie to fire Al-Nassr 2-1 ahead with just minutes remaining.However, Roger Ibanez’s late header ensured the match went to penalties.In the shootout, Ronaldo converted his kick with laser-like precision, but was let down by the missed attempts of his co-stars. Mendy proved decisive, saving Abdullah Al-Khaibari’s effort to seal victory for Al-Ahli. It left Ronaldo and his teammates reflecting on another missed opportunity.The 40-year-old forward did reach a personal landmark, scoring his 100th goal for Al-Nassr. In doing so, he became the first player in history to net 100 or more goals for five different teams – Manchester United, Real Madrid, Juventus, Al-Nassr and Portugal.For Ronaldo, the milestone offered little comfort. The player was seen distraught after the defeat and in low spirits after yet another final slipped from his grasp.

That’s a big if. It’s legit and everybody knows it,” Smith said on the show.The Mavericks struggled after Davis joined in October 2024. In his very first game for Dallas, Davis injured his left adductor. He missed 18 games in a row. Irving’s bad luck came later in the season. On March 3, he tore his ACL and was ruled out.Without their two stars, Dallas missed the playoffs.Fans were disappointed, but Smith reminded everyone that the story is not over.

If both are fit, Smith believes Dallas could become one of the most dangerous teams in the league.Stephen A.

Right on that list, he placed Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, Luka Doncic, Kevin Durant, and Jimmy Butler.Leading into the 2025–26 NBA season, every one of these names has a main plotline.

Butler was seen working out in Miami and even played some tennis to keep in shape. Concentrating on his rehabilitation, Irving is trying to get ready by the beginning of the season.Smith summed up his opinion by stressing availability. “It’s all about availability. If Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving are on the court together, nobody wants to face the Mavericks,” he said.The Mavericks begin their preseason in early October 2025. All eyes will be on Davis and Irving to see if they can finally deliver what Dallas traded for a championship run.","The Dallas Mavericks shocked the NBA world by trading Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers for Anthony Davis.
