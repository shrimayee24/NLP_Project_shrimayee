with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three

books

with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

(Thirukkural 111)

“To treat all — enemies, strangers, and friends — with equal fairness,

is the highest virtue.”

Thiruvalluvar envisioned a world where justice was a balance beam, not a weapon — where the ruler, the ruled, and even the voiceless stood on equal ground. But what happens when power begins to decide what is right?The following quote, often misattributed as a dialogue by Marlon Brando in the movie, has always stayed with me:“When you hold a gun and I hold a gun, we can talk about law. If you hold a knife and I hold a knife, we can talk about rules. If we both are empty handed, we can talk about reason. But if you have a gun and I only have a knife, then the truth lies in your hands. The concepts of law and rules hold meaning only when they rest on equality.”It is a chilling reflection — that law has meaning only when force stands equal. Fiction or not, it mirrors reality uncomfortably well.In a case that drew significant public attention, the wealthy accused in a fatal BMW car crash in Delhi was reportedly taken to a distant hospital where her father was a director, instead of a nearby one.Power dislikes being questioned. In a society divided between the powerful and the powerless, rules stop being rules — they become tools for the strong and chains for the weak.I was reminded of this fragile balance a few years ago during a visit to London. Our team was invited for lunch by a wealthy business magnate who later offered to drop us at Heathrow airport. When we stepped outside, a gleaming black Rolls Royce stood waiting — my first ride in one.At Heathrow, where vehicles are allowed to halt barely for a minute, our chauffeur parked calmly, helped us unload, and even offered to walk us inside. I asked, “Won’t the police fine you for waiting here?” He smiled politely and said nothing.I realised how deeply power infiltrates even the most rule-bound societies. When money speaks, rules go silent.And then my mind turned to a story from— one that shows what justice once meant in our land.In the 12th-century classic, among the 63 Nayanmaars stands, a Chola king whose very name became a byword for righteousness. One day, the king’s son was driving his chariot when a calf darted across and was crushed under its wheels. The grieving mother cow went to the palace and rang the— the bell of inquiry the king had installed to hear the cries of those wronged. It was the first time that bell had ever been rung.The minister examined the case and cleverly shifted the blame, declaring that the calf was at fault for straying into the chariot’s path. But the king, the guardian of justice, refused such a convenient solution. “If a mother is grieving in my land, justice demands that I share her pain,” he said and ordered that his own son be given the same fate as the calf. The prince was executed — and legend says divine grace restored both the calf and the prince to life.An ideal society indeed — where the voiceless and the mighty were treated as equals.Today, such stories read like distant echoes. We have laws and law enforcement agencies— yet the truth still bends before status, wealth, or influence. Thiruvalluvar’s call for impartiality remains not merely a virtue, but a test of civilization itself.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124456253,imgsize-45436,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/124456253.jpg"

Former NBA player backs Russell Westbrook amid LeBron James ’ scapegoating rumor

Russell Westbrook last played for the Denver Nuggets, but he is currently a free agent. While the Sacramento Kings got themselves hinged with the former NBA MVP, Westbrook is now rumored to have been linked with a new offer overseas. A Chinese team is now eyeing Westbrook for a massive deal, and it’s all over social media. The still-unnamed team is willing to pay the former Nuggets star quadruple what the Sacramento Kings had offered to him. Now that is a huge advancement for Westbrook after the scapegoating rumor that had him blamed for all the wrong reasons during his time with the Los Angeles Lakers. Here’s more information about Russell Westbrook and his big moment with the Chinese team:According to Carmichael Dave of Sactown Sports 1140, an unnamed Chinese team is willing to offer Russell Westbrook a mega deal. The new agreement is willing to offer four times more than what the Sacramento Kings initially offered to Westbrook.“I heard something from someone I trust enough not to blow off what they said. He may have an offer in China for about half a season”, Carmichael Dave said on the podcast. “And it’s damn near quadruple what the Kings could offer him”, he further added.However, previously, the former NBA MVP was linked to the Xinjiang Flying Tigers, as per PlayProphetx.Now, the question is whether Westbrook will sign the deal with the unnamed Chinese team.Even if he does sign for half a season, he could return to the big league by January, and that sounds like a fair deal. Every other player has done it over the course of many years.After the failure of the Los Angeles Lakers in 2021, while Westbrook was still a part of it, the former NBA MVP had to face many criticisms about the same. According to the former ex-NBA player, Enes Kanter, Westbrook became the scapegoat of the team led by Lebron James.“If you play with someone like LeBron, it’s all about LeBron. And if the season fails, then you need some kind of scapegoat”, said Kanter. “After that, look at his career—this guy can’t even find a team right now”, Enes Kanter added further. He also added that huge scapegoating affected Westbrook mentally, and he didn’t deserve this.Also read: Enes Kanter slams LeBron James and Los Angeles Lakers for destroying Russell Westbrook’s career after 2021 disaster",A Chinese team is now eyeing Russell Westbrook for a massive deal.

Stephen Curry, the NBA legend, and his wife, Ayesha Curry, have been getting brutally criticised ever since she made a few controversial remarks about how she wanted different things in her life. Amid all the mess, a resurfaced video of Ayesha Curry making a controversial gesture while spotting a shirtless man has sparked outrage among fans.A couple of years ago, Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, appeared on The Real Daytime, where she was spotted sitting with the hosts.At one point, a shirtless waiter walks in on the set and Ayesha Curry makes a gesture of trying to take off her wedding ring as soon as he spots him.While this was a humorous and playful gesture, the video has sparked outrage among fans as many feel their marriage is “on the rocks”.A fan by the username @misfit8089421 wrote, “She’s literally the worst, Steph is a goofy for marrying this disrespectful & pathetic, she’s so jealous of him & desperate for attention it’s cringy. Not to mention she’s not even all that he found did way better. He gonna end up like his dad divorced if he’s not careful…”Another fan by the username @__AyooDae wrote, “They could get divorced and her book will be titled “being married to Stephen curry” and i bet she wouldn’t go back to her maiden name.”A third fan by the username @TDHBXG posted, “Steph should just start cheating. That will trigger the divorce.

Assessing the Winners

My Final Thoughts on this Mock Trade

Theare reportedly exploring a potential trade with the Washington Wizards centered around sharpshooter, with young forward Jonathan Kuminga expected to headline the package heading to D.C. The rumored deal has generated considerable buzz around the NBA, as Golden State looks to strengthen its championship hopes, improve roster balance, and create more financial flexibility during the final stages of Stephen Curry’s title window.According to multiple reports, the proposed trade structure would see the Golden State Warriors send Jonathan Kuminga to the Wizards in exchange for Corey Kispert and a future 2030 first-round draft pick - a selection that originally belonged to Golden State.• Golden State Warriors receive: Corey Kispert, 2030 first-round pick (originally theirs)• Washington Wizards receive: Jonathan KumingaThis swap would immediately benefit Golden State financially, as Kispert’s projected $13.9 million contract is roughly $8.6 million less than Kuminga’s $22.5 million deal, easing the team’s growing luxury tax concerns.For the Golden State Warriors, acquiring Corey Kispert would address several needs simultaneously. The 26-year-old wing is a proven 3-and-D specialist who thrives in motion offenses, making him a seamless fit next to Curry, Jimmy Butler , and Draymond Green. His career 38.2% shooting from beyond the arc adds another reliable perimeter threat to a team that thrives on spacing and quick ball movement.Another key benefit is the reacquisition of their 2030 first-round pick, which increases the team’s flexibility for future trades. Moreover, the move reduces overall salary obligations, aligning with the front office’s strategy to trim costs while keeping the roster competitive.For Washington, this trade represents a classic rebuilding move. By landing 22-year-old Jonathan Kuminga , the Wizards secure a high-upside player with star potential. Kuminga’s athleticism, defensive versatility, and ability to create off the dribble make him an exciting addition to their young core. The Wizards can offer him a larger offensive role, providing the developmental environment he needs to unlock his full potential and become a franchise cornerstone.• Immediate upgrade in floor spacing and perimeter shooting.• A better positional fit in Steve Kerr’s offensive system.• Relief from financial pressure with reduced salary commitments.• Regained control of a valuable future draft asset.• Losing a young player with genuine star potential.• Corey Kispert’s defensive limitations and lack of elite athleticism could cap his ceiling.• Reduced long-term upside, as Kuminga’s best years may still be ahead.• Acquire a former lottery pick with elite athleticism and untapped potential.• Kuminga can grow into a featured role on a team focused on development.• Ideal move for a rebuilding franchise seeking future stars.• Loss of a key floor-spacer in Kispert, potentially affecting offensive balance.• Uncertainty over whether Kuminga can develop into a consistent, franchise-level player in a losing environment.Corey Kispert’s strength lies in his efficiency as a spot-up shooter and off-ball mover. Standing at 6-foot-7, he has improved his ability to find space within offensive schemes but remains limited as a creator and defender. Kuminga, on the other hand, offers elite athleticism, defensive versatility, and a far higher developmental ceiling, though he remains inconsistent and unproven as a lead scorer.• Golden State Warriors: This is a “win-now” move that prioritizes fit, shooting, and financial relief. The front office’s focus is clearly on maximizing Curry’s championship window, even if it means parting with a potential future star.• Washington Wizards: The Wizards get the long-term win by adding a potential franchise player in Kuminga, aligning perfectly with their rebuilding vision.• Jonathan Kuminga: Gains a larger role and more on-ball opportunities in Washington, but must prove he can thrive without veteran guidance in a rebuilding setup.• Corey Kispert: Lands in an ideal environment in Golden State, where his shooting and movement can shine alongside elite playmakers.The proposed trade between Golden State and Washington encapsulates the contrasting priorities of both franchises - one aiming to capitalize on its championship core, the other looking to secure its future. For the Golden State Warriors, it’s a calculated gamble that enhances shooting, chemistry, and flexibility. For the Wizards, it’s an investment in potential that could pay off massively if Kuminga fulfills his promise.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Utah Jazz Could Part Ways With $238 Million Superstar Ahead of 2025-26 Season; Exploring Possible Better Teams Ultimately, the deal will be judged by what Kuminga becomes. If he develops into an All-Star, Washington walks away with a clear victory. But if Corey Kispert helps the Golden State Warriors capture another title, Golden State’s decision to prioritize the present will look like a masterstroke.","The Golden State Warriors are reportedly exploring a potential trade with the Washington Wizards centered around sharpshooter Jonathan Kuminga.

My Two Cents: Who Wins the Trade?

Theare reportedly weighing a blockbuster trade proposal that could drastically reshape their roster ahead of the 2025-26 NBA season. With LeBron James ’ health being carefully managed and uncertainty surrounding his availability for the season opener, the Lakers appear open to bold moves to stay competitive.As the regular season approaches, LeBron James ’ readiness remains in question. According to his agent, Rich Paul, the Los Angeles Lakers have been advised to take a cautious route to ensure the veteran star is fully healthy for what could be one of the final runs of his storied career.“LeBron wants to compete for a championship,” Paul told ESPN. “He knows the Lakers are building for the future. He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all. We are very appreciative of the partnership that we’ve had for eight years with Jeanie [Buss] and Rob [Pelinka] and consider the Lakers as a critical part of his career.” (H/t: Sporting News)James, now entering his 22nd season, is prioritizing longevity and success over rushing back to the court. The Los Angeles Lakers, in turn, are reportedly exploring options to add more star power to their lineup and support their aging superstar.Reports suggest the Los Angeles Lakers are keeping a close watch on the Utah Jazz, particularly regarding two of their players - Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen. While Kessler’s availability remains uncertain, there are whispers that Utah might entertain offers for Markkanen if the right package is presented.“It’s unclear if Utah will be reasonable in its trade demands for Kessler, but the door appears at least slightly ajar for the Lakers to bring that value back to Los Angeles given the failed extension,” wrote Lake Show Life’s Max Ogden.Bleacher Report’s Andy Bailey proposed a hypothetical trade that has since gained traction among fans and analysts. The deal would send a significant haul from Los Angeles to Utah in exchange for All-Star forward Lauri Markkanen - who is currently on a $195 million deal.The deal is designed to give the Los Angeles Lakers another elite scorer who can stretch the floor alongside Anthony Davis, potentially forming a dangerous frontcourt duo.While landing Markkanen would instantly improve the Lakers’ offensive potential, the price tag is enormous. Losing young contributors like Reaves and Hachimura would strip Los Angeles of much of its depth and chemistry, while Knecht’s departure would mean sacrificing a promising long-term asset.For Utah, the return is far more appealing.

The Jazz would gain both present and future assets, while the Lakers would risk sacrificing depth and flexibility for a single All-Star addition.As noted by Hunter Cookston, who reported the story, “The proposed trade would certainly shake up the NBA - but for the Lakers, it’s questionable at best.

The Tragic Story Behind Korean Influencer Yoon Ji-ah’s Passing

Confession and Arrest of Yoon Ji-ah’s Killer



The Man Who took the life of TikToker Yoon Ji-ah — The Dark Truth Behind “Black Cat”

The digital world in South Korea is mourning after losing Yoon Ji-ah who was known for being a TikToker and live streamer with more than 300,000 fans. On September 11, she was found dead on a secluded mountain in Muju County, North Jeolla Province, only a few hours after her last live stream. The terrifying circumstances of her passing have once again raised the issues of the dark side of fan communities and influencer security in the era of the internet.Police have indicated that Yoon Ji-ah met with her death about 30 minutes after cutting off her last stream. The 30-year-old digital star was pronounced dead with serious physical injuries inflicted on her body through beating, strangling, and asphyxias. Later, the medical examiner declared the cause of death to be suffocation from neck compression.Initially, the fan's affection reportedly transformed into obsession. Choi, who presented himself as a CEO enjoying success, was actually an individual who had gotten into deep financial trouble and lost his home through auction. He had created a fake persona and was financially supported which led him to create a close bond with Yoon and even convince her to go into business together.But there were reports about Yoon having recently sought to break the ties claiming controlling behavior and demanding schedule as reasons. The CCTV clips released by the detectives showed Choi kneeling and asking for forgiveness just before the tragic event. As per his later confession, he dragged her into her car before killing.After the murder, Choi made an effort to hide his actions, dressing up with a suitcase, and taking several stops to misdirect the police before he left Yoon's body on the mountainside. He was captured 12 hours after the incident. He first proclaimed his innocence but later admitted it when the police found the corpse.The death of Yoon Ji-ah has created a wave of nationwide protests and mourning compared to which the calls for more effective safety measures for content creators against the obsessive online behavior are stronger than ever. Her death serves as a grim reminder of the dangers influencers face, prompting urgent calls for stronger digital safety laws, mental health awareness, and accountability within online communities to prevent similar tragedies. Yoon Ji-ah’s story stands as a haunting reminder of love turned obsession, fame turned fear, and the urgent need to protect those who bring light to the digital world.","Yoon Ji-ah was found dead on a mountain in North Jeolla Province, South Korea.

Andre Agassi opens up about leading Team World at the 2025 Laver Cup

“I wasn’t sure what to expect. I barely know how I’m going to be every day in my own life, let alone something I haven’t done before.

But one thing I can say is — I still have that bottled-up competitiveness inside me.”

“These guys gave it their all. I had Ferraris on the court. It was one of the most special weeks I’ve ever had,”

Andre Agassi, the American tennis legend, recently shared a set of old pictures showing his famous tennis looks after leading Team World to victory at the 2025 Laver Cup in San Francisco, held from September 19 to 21, 2025. The post showed his bold and fun fashion choices from the 1980s and 1990s, long hair, bright neon colors, bandanas, earrings, and even his famous denim shorts from the 1988 US Open.Agassi, now 55, wrote on Instagram sharing memories from his early career. His daughter, Jaz Elle Agassi, replied with just one word,The simple comment caught attention, as fans loved how the 21-year-old praised her dad’s style.

His “neon era,” between 1990 and 1992, stood out for its bright colors and futuristic prints.After Andre Andre and Steffi Graf’s daughter’s comment made headlines, Agassi also shared his thoughts about his first time as Team World’s captain.His team, featuring Taylor Fritz, Alex de Minaur, Francisco Cerúndolo, Alex Michelsen, João Fonseca, and Reilly Opelka, defeated Team Europe 15–9 at the Chase Center in San Francisco.Speaking about the experience, Andre Agassi told The Tennis Gazette,Also Read: “They Were So Jealous:” Steffi Graf’s Father Peter Once Exposed German Media After Her 1991 Wimbledon Win He said the victory was not just about winning, but about teamwork and spirit.he said.Andre Agassi’s return to the tennis spotlight reminded fans not only of his coaching skills but also of the bold, fearless style that once made him a global icon, a legacy his daughter Jaz now proudly celebrates.","Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf’s daughter Jaz Elle melts hearts with her one-word reaction to father's iconic tennis fashion.

10 simple reasons Donald Trump didn't win the Nobel Peace Prize,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/10-simple-reasons-donald-trump-didnt-win-the-nobel-peace-prize/articleshow/124462794.cms,"Trump didn’t treat peace as a process — he treated it as a PR stunt.

1. He Tried Too Hard



Nobel Chair Reveals Why Trump Did Not Win Peace Prize 2025; 'We Have Seen Many Such Campaigns...'

2. His Foreign Policy Was the Opposite of “Peace”



3. The Obama Obsession Backfired



4. He Made Peace a Performance



5. He Undermined the Global Order the Nobel Celebrates



6. The Totality of His Legacy Worked Against Him



7. There Were Far Stronger Candidates



8. His Style Violated the Nobel’s Unwritten Code



9. The Committee Fears Another “Kissinger Moment”



10. The Nobel Is About More Than Results — It’s About Values







Donald Trump has spent years chasing a prize he will almost certainly never hold. To him, the Nobel Peace Prize isn’t just a medal — it’s the final validation of his legacy, the cinematic closing scene where history applauds and Barack Obama seethes in the background. Yet year after year, Oslo says no. The reasons go far beyond partisan dislike or media bias. They lie in a deeper mismatch between what the Nobel stands for and what Trump represents. Here are ten of them.The Nobel Committee loathes overt campaigning. Its mystique depends on aloofness — the idea that peace is recognised, not demanded. Trump, however, treated the prize like a campaign trail promise. He lobbied allies, pressured foreign leaders to nominate him, and even hinted that Norway might face tariffs if Oslo continued to snub him. In Nobel politics, desperation is disqualifying.The Peace Prize honours those who advance fraternity among nations. Trump’s record often did the opposite. He tore up the Paris Climate Accord, withdrew from WHO, shredded arms-control treaties, and waged tariff wars on allies. He mocked NATO, belittled the UN, and reduced diplomacy to branding. Even if some initiatives were genuine, the overall picture was one of disruption, not harmony.Trump’s fixation with Obama’s 2009 Nobel — awarded just eight months into his presidency — has defined his pursuit ever since. Every summit, handshake, and deal was framed as evidence he had “done more” than Obama. But the Nobel Committee doesn’t reward vendettas. Seeking the prize as a weapon against a predecessor only underscored that Trump saw it as a trophy, not a responsibility.Trump didn’t treat peace as a process — he treated it as a PR stunt. The Abraham Accords, North Korea summits, and Taliban negotiations were often packaged for maximum headlines rather than lasting impact. Oslo prefers sustained, structural contributions over flashy photo-ops. Symbolism matters, but it cannot replace substance.The Peace Prize is as much about supporting international cooperation as it is about ending conflicts. Trump’s “America First” ethos clashed with that vision. He weakened multilateral institutions, insulted allies, and emboldened autocrats. For a committee that sees itself as the guardian of the post-war order, rewarding the man who tried to dismantle it was unthinkable.While Trump could point to achievements like the Abraham Accords or Kosovo economic agreements, they were offset by decisions that deepened instability — from quitting the Iran nuclear deal to escalating tensions with China and North Korea. The Nobel weighs the whole legacy, not isolated wins. Trump’s overall record was too contradictory to justify the prize.The 2025 laureate, Venezuelan dissident María Corina Machado, embodied the kind of perseverance and courage the Nobel seeks. She risked her life to challenge dictatorship, built grassroots movements, and never campaigned for recognition. Against that backdrop, Trump’s self-promotion looked shallow — and the contrast sealed his fate.The Nobel Prize thrives on moral gravitas and understated leadership. Trump thrives on bombast and grievance. His habit of calling the prize “rigged,” attacking past winners, and belittling the process made it politically impossible for the committee to consider him seriously. The Nobel doesn’t bend to tantrums.After past embarrassments — Kissinger amid the Vietnam War, Suu Kyi before the Rohingya crisis — the Nobel Committee has become more cautious. Awarding Trump risked turning the prize into a global joke. The potential backlash outweighed any argument in his favour.At its core, the Peace Prize is not a scoreboard for foreign policy achievements. It is a statement about who embodies the ideals of cooperation, empathy, and shared humanity. Trump’s politics — transactional, nationalist, divisive — run counter to those values. That’s why, no matter how many deals he signs or wars he claims to end, the Nobel will remain beyond his reach.Bottom line: Trump sees the Nobel as a vindication — a mirror that reflects his greatness back to the world. But the Nobel isn’t a mirror. It’s a moral compass. And as long as his politics point in the opposite direction, it will remain the one prize he cannot win.","Donald Trump has spent years chasing a prize he will almost certainly never hold.

Bill Belichick focused on rebuilding UNC amid early season struggles



Off-field controversies and docuseries setback add to Belichick’s challenges



Bill Belichick, one of football’s most storied coaches, is facing early turbulence in his first college season with the University of North Carolina. Despite a rough 2-3 start and swirling reports suggesting UNC had explored a buyout, sources close to the 73-year-old coach insist he was “never looking into buyouts for UNC. ” Belichick, they claim, was as blindsided as anyone when the speculation surfaced earlier this week.According to PEOPLE, the legendary former Patriots coach was “surprised” to learn about the rumors that UNC officials were discussing his exit just five games into the season. “It’s all sensational drama,” the source added, emphasizing Belichick’s continued commitment to turning the program around.Belichick, who famously referred to North Carolina as “the 33rd NFL franchise” during offseason recruiting, has struggled to replicate his pro-level success on the college field. The Tar Heels’ disappointing performances—including heavy losses to TCU, UCF, and Clemson—have only intensified scrutiny. Still, both Belichick and UNC have dismissed any notion of a split, releasing a joint statement reaffirming that they remain “fully committed” to their partnership.Behind the scenes, however, tensions have reportedly brewed. A WRAL-TV report described the program as “an unstructured mess,” with claims of poor communication between coaches and players.In the wake of these allegations, assistant coach Armond Hawkins was suspended for violating NCAA rules by providing unauthorized sideline passes.Away from the gridiron, Belichick’s off-field life has been equally scrutinized. His relationship with 24-year-old Jordon Hudson, a former cheerleader who recently began acting as his publicist, has drawn public attention—and concern from some of his former players and friends. Their partnership gained further visibility after a CBS interview featuring the couple went viral, adding to the ongoing media frenzy surrounding the coach.To make matters more complicated, a former North Carolina official has filed a lawsuit alleging that Belichick was illegally hired by the university. Meanwhile, a Hulu-backed docuseries chronicling his first season at UNC has reportedly been put on hold, with insiders suggesting the streaming giant’s creative direction “wasn’t in alignment” with the university’s vision.Despite the chaos, Belichick remains steadfast. His focus, sources say, is still on leading UNC football forward—a challenge perhaps tougher than any he faced in his 24 years with the New England Patriots.Also Read: Bo Nix’s wife Izzy steals spotlight with touching four-word pregnancy reveal before Broncos face the Jets","Bill Belichick is facing early turbulence in his first college season with the University of North Carolina.

Shubman Gill on ODI captaincy: Leading India with lessons from Rohit Sharma & Virat Kohli

Poll Do you think Jaiswal will convert his innings into a double century? Yes, definitely! Maybe, but it's uncertain

NEW DELHI: The opening day of the second India vs West Indies Test at Arun Jaitley Stadium on Friday belonged to Yashasvi Jaiswal , whose scintillating 173 not out anchored India to a commanding 318/2 at stumps. Alongside him, captain Shubman Gill remained unbeaten on 20, as the duo added 67 crucial runs for the third wicket, putting India firmly in control of the match.While Jaiswal’s batting brilliance stole the headlines, a light-hearted yet unusual incident captured the imagination of fans worldwide. Towards the end of the day, Gill suffered a nasty collision with West Indies wicketkeeper Tevin Imlach during a quick single in the 85th over. Both players looked visibly shaken, prompting medical staff to rush on for treatment.In a viral moment that has since taken social media by storm, Jaiswal was seen taking charge of Gill’s concussion check. The 23-year-old opener humorously asked the Indian captain how many fingers he was holding up, mimicking the standard concussion protocol while both players shared a laugh. Fans praised the playful gesture, showcasing Jaiswal’s awareness and camaraderie on the field.Jaiswal’s innings itself was historic. His 173 came off 253 balls and included 22 fours, marking his second instance of scoring 150+ runs on the first day of a Test in India, after a 179-run masterclass against England in Vizag in 2024. Only Virat Kohli has achieved a similar feat on the same venues. Out of his seven Test centuries, five have crossed the 150-run mark, placing him in elite company alongside Don Bradman , who had eight 150+ scores before turning 24.With India ending Day 1 on 318/2, the focus now shifts to whether Jaiswal can convert his dominance into a bigger score and help India seal a 2-0 series sweep.",Yashasvi Jaiswal scores 173 not out as India reach 318/2 on Day 1 of second Test.

IND vs WI 1st Test: Why West Indies' decision to bat first vs India backfired?

Poll Will Yashasvi Jaiswal score a triple century in his innings? Yes, he will achieve it! No, he won't reach that milestone.

NEW DELHI: India’s legendary spinner Anil Kumble lavished high praise on opener Yashasvi Jaiswal after the young left-hander’s unbeaten 173 lit up the opening day of the second Test against West Indies at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Friday. The former India captain went a step further — tipping Jaiswal to turn his marathon innings into a historic triple hundred on Saturday.“Jaiswal is just getting better and better day by day,” Kumble said on JioHotstar’s Amul Cricket Live. “We’ve spoken about his hunger and his attitude toward building big innings, not just for himself but for the team. Even in the previous game, he got off to a good start but was dismissed early, so he’s certainly made up for that here.”The 23-year-old southpaw, who has already amassed almost 2500 runs in just 26 Tests with seven centuries and 12 fifties, batted through the entire first day. His 173 came off 253 balls, decorated with 22 fours, and put India in command at 318/2 at stumps.Kumble, who has seen several modern greats from close quarters, lauded Jaiswal’s temperament and ability to convert starts into monumental knocks. “Throughout his short career, he has shown that he doesn’t waste opportunities like these.Once he’s in, he makes it count — and that’s wonderful to see,” he said.The veteran also pointed out Jaiswal’s rare consistency in producing big hundreds — five of his seven centuries have been scores over 150. Only Graeme Smith and Don Bradman have comparable numbers before turning 24.With the pitch flattening out and West Indies’ bowlers already looking fatigued, Kumble urged the youngster to aim even higher. “He’s still out there, and he can go on to score big runs tomorrow… Jaiswal now has a great opportunity, not just for a double hundred, but maybe even a triple hundred,” Kumble added.If Jaiswal does convert his unbeaten 173 into a triple century, he would become only the third Indian in history to do so — joining Virender Sehwag and Karun Nair.",Yashasvi Jaiswal scored unbeaten 173 on opening day of second Test against West Indies.

Poll Which team's performance impressed you the most in their latest match? Germany Northern Ireland France Switzerland

Germany, four-time World Cup winners, returned to winning ways on Friday, thrashing 10-man Luxembourg 4-0 to reclaim top spot in Group A. Captain Joshua Kimmich was the star of the show, scoring a first-half penalty and tapping in a second goal shortly after the break. David Raum’s precise free-kick and Serge Gnabry’s early second-half strike sealed the emphatic win for Julian Nagelsmann’s side.Germany, who endured group-stage exits in both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, showed a renewed poise and swagger missing from their earlier qualifiers. The victory moved them level on points with Slovakia and Northern Ireland, but ahead on goal difference. Luxembourg’s task became near-impossible after Dirk Carlson was sent off for a handball inside the box within the first 20 minutes, conceding the penalty that Kimmich converted.Northern Ireland kept alive hopes of a fourth World Cup appearance and a first since 1986, defeating Slovakia 2-0 at Windsor Park. An early own goal from Patrik Hrosovsky and a stunning late volley by Trai Hume secured the win. “It was a great night, good performance and the most important thing is the three points,” Hume said.In Paris, Kylian Mbappe continued his fine form at Parc des Princes, scoring just before halftime to mark his 10th goal in consecutive games for Real Madrid and France. Adrien Rabiot and the returning Florian Thauvin also scored as Didier Deschamps’ side eased past Azerbaijan 3-0, remaining unbeaten after three matches and leading Group D. Despite the win, Deschamps urged caution ahead of Monday’s clash in Iceland. “It’s three points more but perhaps not in the way we wanted… Monday will be another game, another context,” he said.Elsewhere, Switzerland maintained their perfect record in Group B, defeating Sweden 2-0, while Kosovo and Slovenia played out a goalless draw. Belgium, chasing a 13th World Cup appearance, were held 0-0 by North Macedonia, who currently top Group J after famously eliminating Germany from the 2022 World Cup qualifiers.With key wins and dominant performances from the likes of Germany, France, and Switzerland, the race for World Cup qualification in Europe is heating up, leaving fans eagerly anticipating Monday’s pivotal fixtures.","Germany thrash 10-man Luxembourg 4-0 to reclaim top spot in Group A.

Rohit Sharma removed as India ODI captain, a glorious era comes to an end

Poll Do you agree with Mohammad Kaif that Rohit Sharma will play a key role in the 2027 ODI World Cup despite losing captaincy? Yes, I completely agree No, I disagree

NEW DELHi: Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif has made a bold statement about Rohit Sharma ’s future, asserting that the Mumbai batter will feature prominently in the 2027 ODI World Cup despite being relieved of his captaincy. Shubman Gill was recently appointed India’s new ODI captain ahead of the three-match series against Australia starting October 19, but Kaif believes Rohit’s leadership status will not affect his role as a key opener for India.“He will definitely play, boss. Look, the captaincy may have been taken away from him, but I believe that as an opener, Rohit Sharma will do his job,” Kaif said on his YouTube channel.The former cricketer highlighted the importance of experience in challenging conditions, particularly in South Africa, where the World Cup will be co-hosted alongside Zimbabwe and Namibia. “You need an experienced batter in the side. You can’t go to South Africa with an entirely young team. Sometimes in those seaming conditions, the ball moves a lot and the pitches are bouncy. If you take only new players there, they’ll get exposed.Kaif praised Rohit’s ability to handle pace and bounce, saying, “That’s why I feel you need a player who can handle the bounce, who can pull and cut the rising deliveries just like Rohit Sharma does. On those kinds of pitches, I believe Rohit Sharma will perform even better. His batting style as an opener suits such conditions perfectly. He plays the rising ball, the one that bounces from the front, extremely well. Among all the players you can name, Rohit Sharma is the only one who handles that rising delivery so effectively. ”He also emphasised the importance of combining youth with experience in crucial tournaments.“Just look at his numbers, his years of experience. On a big stage like the World Cup, you need players like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, players who have seen the world and experienced ups and downs. In a tournament like the World Cup, you’re going to lose a game or two in between, then you’ll need to make a comeback. You’ll face those do-or-die matches where you must win to reach the quarterfinals or top four. In such crucial situations, the roles of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli become absolutely vital.”",Mohammad Kaif believes Rohit Sharma will play a key role in the 2027 ODI World Cup despite being relieved of his captaincy.

IND vs WI 1st Test: Why West Indies' decision to bat first vs India backfired?

Poll Do you think Yashasvi Jaiswal can surpass Sachin Tendulkar's Test century record? Yes, he has the talent. No, Tendulkar's record is monumental.

NEW DELHI: Test cricket can be hard, brutal business if you lack penetration as a bowling unit. Coming into this game, the West Indies had the third worst win-loss ratio in Tests since 2020, having lost 23 of 41 matches, making them marginally better than Bangladesh and bottom-placed Ireland. That lack of aptitude and imagination showed at the Ferozeshah Kotla on Friday, in spite of periods of disciplined bowling, as the once-mighty Windies bowling unit seemed cannon fodder for a strong Indian top order on a dry, batting-friendly surface.For those who missed out in Ahmedabad, it was time to rack up the numbers — Yashasvi Jaiswal reminded the world of his penchant for daddy hundreds, becoming only the second Test opener after Graeme Smith to score seven Test tons before turning 24. Among Indians, he is now second only to the peerless Sachin Tendulkar , who had scored 11. Five of his hundreds are scores of 150 or more. Giving Jaiswal company for most of the day was the under-pressure Sai Sudharsan, who fell 13 runs short of the three-figure mark but played an important role in a 193-run second-wicket stand, the fourth-highest partnership ever by a lefthanded Indian pair in Tests.Jaiswal ended the day batting on 173 off 253 balls (22x4) and passed 3,000 runs across formats. India took stumps on Day One of the second Test at 318/2 after Shubman Gill won the first toss of his short captaincy career.It was all worthy pursuit for India — they are chasing the full WTC points at home and some have reputations at stake, so there were no half-hearted measures. For the West Indies, it was ceaseless toil, with only left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican coming away with some special moments, notably the dismissals of KL Rahul and Sudharsan, with some alarming turn offering a portent of what might be to come in this Test.West Indies had seemed despondent in the days leading up to the Test and must have been world weary by the end of Day One. None of that matters, of course, to Jaiswal, who played largely within himself, mindful of the need to take the game away from the opposition on the first day itself.Jaiswal scored only 10 off his first 36 deliveries, trying to increase the control percentage of the cut shots which have been both his boon and bane, as the West Indies seamers started off with controlled lengths and disciplined lines. A yard or two of extra pace would have gone a long way, though.Even before an hour was through, Jaiswal was heard on the stump mic telling his opening partner how nothing much was happening off the pitch, a typical Kotla phenomenon, and with little seam movement on offer, it was a matter of time before the bowlers’ lengths disintegrated and India’s batting found some fluency.There will be a lot of spin to be bowled yet, but the first wicket that fell to spinners in this game was a wonderful one — an unusually aggressive Rahul was left mystified, first beaten in the air and then off the pitch by one from Warrican which turned 84 degrees, having landed either on the seam or on a crack.The dismissal only strengthened the hungry Jaiswal’s resolve to leave his imprint on the game. He decided to adapt minimalism instead of expansive, ambitious strokeplay or bold footwork, playing crisp, clean cover drives, straight drives, threading open spaces behind square when available and rotating strike efficiently. By the second session, his trademark run-scoring square of the wicket was in full view as Jayden Seales started offering width.With no innovation or attempt to disrupt proceedings by Windies captain Roston Chase, all Jaiswal needed to do was exhibit restraint and then cash in on loose offerings. The Windies bowled no extras but Jaiswal reacted by not attempting any sixes throughout the day.Sure, the seamers could have bowled fuller, especially in the middle session, while the spinners could have made more effort to change the angles. The captain could have messed up the fields a bit more to plant doubts in the batters’ minds, but maybe Chase knew the Indian batters would just raise their game.Such is most of Test cricket these days, strangely lop-sided affairs which have largely alienated the cricket-loving masses. Not counting, of course, contests between the chosen top three or four teams, most of which have had robust first-class structures with strong financial backing in place for close to a century or more. For the others, there is perhaps little incentive remaining now to invest in building such infrastructure for the red-ball game.India’s expected dominance on Day One may further deflate the Windies, meaning there might be more to come from Jaiswal. Sudharsan, meanwhile, showed he deserved a longer rope at No. 3.","Yashasvi Jaiswal becomes only the second Test opener after Graeme Smith to score seven Test tons before turning 24.

In Week 6 of the 2025 NFL season, the Philadelphia Eagles lost to the New York Giants by a disappointing score of 34-17. Some fans blame Eagles offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo—they want him fired. Amid growing online outrage over the Eagles' loss to the Giants, Eagles star quarterback Jalen Hurts’ views on Patullo resurfaced. Back in February, before the season began, Hurts shared, “His job is gonna demand something totally different of him.”Kevin Patullo, 44, has been with the Philadelphia Eagles since 2021. For two seasons, he served as their passing game coordinator. Then, in 2023 and 2024, he took on the role of passing game coordinator and associate head coach. It was only in 2025, after Kellen Moore left to become the New Orleans Saints head coach, that Patullo transitioned to (was promoted to) offensive coordinator, taking over for Moore’s previously dominant offense. Now, what is the difference between his two roles?On February 20, ESPN Eagles/NFL Reporter Tim McManus shared on X, Hurts said,“Kevin Patullo has never been…I mean, he’d have a different role. So, it’s hard to compare that role (as passing game coordinator) to this role (offensive coordinator) because his job is gonna demand something totally different of him.I have a lot of confidence in him and what he’s shown. However, I know over the years I’ve learned that it is out of my jurisdiction. So, kind of just taking things as they come. Try to go out there and be the best I can be and just learn.”These comments were made several months before the Eagles’ recent loss to the Giants and the ensuing backlash. But an X account named O.J. Spivey reshared it on October 10.Returning to the present—Eagles fans are fuming with fury over Kevin Patullo’s performance as offensive coordinator. Let’s check out their reactions.One brutally honest fan wrote, “If the Eagles don’t fire Kevin Patullo this week then you can probably write the rest of this season off.”Eagles Fan Central boldly posted this on X: “The defense can at least say they’re down Quinyon, Carter, and Nolan Smith. The offense? Once again scoreless for an entire half. Against the Giants. Orlovsky calling out their predictability. I doubt they do it, but Kevin Patullo is way in over his head and should be dismissed tomorrow. Get a grown-up play caller and stop wasting Saquon, AJ, and DeVonta’s primes.”The Eagle Times asked a straightforward question on X: “YES OR NO: Kevin Patullo needs to be fired.” Fans vehemently reacted to it with one saying yes in different languages: “Yes Si Oui Da Hai Ja.”Another wrote, “Couldn't get Barkley a TD. I have no idea what he's doing.”A third fan shared, “Well he needs to change the way he’s coaching because we are going down real fast.”A fourth fan commented, “I’m starting to think something needs to happen. This offence of all stars look lost.”A fifth fan said, “Yes. Absolutely. The Eagles also need to go out and acquire five or six new defensive players immediately.”","Kevin Patullo, 44, has been with the Philadelphia Eagles since 2021.

Coach André Tourigny highlights Utah Mammoth ’s effort despite 2-1 loss

New signings shine: Utah Mammoth’s rookies and debuts make an impact



The Utah Mammoth showed resilience and promise in their latest NHL matchup, falling 2-1 to the Colorado Avalanche. While the result wasn’t in their favor, the game offered valuable insights into the team’s strengths, young talent, and areas needing improvement. For a squad aiming for playoff contention, these early-season tests are crucial for growth and chemistry.Facing a seasoned opponent like the Avalanche is always challenging. Colorado’s goaltender, Scott Wedgewood, proved nearly impenetrable, turning away multiple scoring opportunities, including a critical save on a late game-tying chance. Head coach André Tourigny acknowledged the challenge, saying, “We had good chances, but Wedgie, the other side, did a good job.” Despite the loss, Utah consistently pressured Wedgewood and created breakaway opportunities, showing flashes of a capable and determined offense.The Mammoth’s young second line—Dylan Guenther, Logan Cooley, and JJ Peterka—showed potential but will require time to build cohesion. Guenther, known for his offensive firepower, also impressed on the penalty kill, intercepting passes and creating a shorthanded scoring attempt.His versatility suggests he could become a key impact player this season.Newcomers made their presence felt as well. JJ Peterka brought speed and dynamic playmaking, demonstrating the ability to generate offense independently. Dmitriy Simashev exceeded expectations in his NHL debut, stepping up after Olli Määttä’s early injury and handling the pressure with poise. “I was nervous, but it went about how I expected,” Simashev said. “I’ll remember this all my life. It was my first game in the NHL. It was unbelievable.” Brandon Tanev, Nate Schmidt, and Andrew Agozzino also integrated well, providing depth and stability.While Utah’s offense must refine shooting lanes and coordination, the game highlighted that the team can challenge elite competition. With additional experience, the Mammoth’s offensive units, combined with their talented young stars, are likely to become more dangerous and effective.Next up, Utah faces the Nashville Predators, offering another chance to strengthen chemistry and build confidence. If the Mammoth continue to learn from these early tests and harness the potential of their rookies and new signings, they could emerge as a genuine playoff contender in the NHL.Also Read: Oilers’ strategic signings secure core stars Connor McDavid, Mattias Ekholm, and Jake Walman – Is a Stanley Cup finally within reach?","The Utah Mammoth lost 2-1 to the Colorado Avalanche.

Kevin Durant feels right at home with the Houston Rockets

Kenyon Martin backs Kevin Durant for MVP 2026



Iman & Kenyon Martin Said Ant Edwards Is Better Than These NBA Stars…

Kevin Durant made a strong statement in his first game with the Houston Rockets. After missing his first three shots, the veteran star turned on the heat and didn’t miss again. Durant scored 20 points in 23 minutes to lead Houston to a 140-127 preseason win over the Utah Jazz. It was his first outing since being traded from the Phoenix Suns in July. The Rockets will hope that Durant’s arrival will take them to the next level after last season’s early playoff exit.Kevin Durant showed no signs of discomfort in his new team. His shooting touch returned quickly after a cold start.After the game, Durant reflected on playing with the new side, the Houston Rockets. “I’ve felt at home since I got here three or four weeks ago, so it felt normal,” said Durant. “It felt like I’ve been here a while. The guys welcomed me pretty kindly, the coaching staff too, so it just felt natural. I haven’t felt any difference.”The Rockets aim to build on their strong 2024-25 season, in which they finished second in the Western Conference. In the game, Amen Thompson impressed with 19 points, seven rebounds, and six assists, while Alperen Sengun showed promise with 13 points and 13 assists.Even without Fred VanVleet, who is recovering from an ACL injury, Houston’s offense looked dangerous. Durant’s calm and confidence gave the team a clear lift.The excitement around Kevin Durant joining the Houston Rockets goes beyond just the team’s management and fans. The ever-positive Kenyon Martin opined on this union on Iman Shumpert’s All In show. When the topic of the 2026 MVP came up, he immediately backed Durant for the honor.“If people stop hating on him, I’m going Kevin Durant,” said Martin.Notably, Durant hasn’t finished in the top five in MVP voting since the 2015-16 season. His years in Golden State, the Achilles injury, and a tough Phoenix stint kept him out of the race. However, Houston may be the change he needs. “I think Houston’s gonna do something, bruh. And he’s gonna drive that s*** dawg,” Martin added, with Iman agreeing.With Durant, Alperen Sengun, and Amen Thompson, the Rockets will have a strong belief that they can rise to the top again!Also Read: Houston Rockets' Kevin Durant Turns Interview Into Flirt Fest With Gorgeous Reporter, Makes Fans Go Crazy","Kevin Durant scored 20 points in 23 minutes to lead Houston to a 140-127 preseason win over the Utah Jazz.

Oilers NHL signings lock Connor McDavid, Mattias Ekholm and Jake Walman



Oilers strengthen offensive depth with Jack Roslovic signing



The Edmonton Oilers are making bold moves this week, cementing their core with key contract extensions and signings that could define their future. Superstar Connor McDavid , along with veteran defensemen Mattias Ekholm and Jake Walman, are all now committed to the team, giving Edmonton stability, salary cap flexibility, and a clear path toward a potential Stanley Cup run.Edmonton GM Stan Bowman has been proactive in securing his top talent. Connor McDavid, the team’s captain and generational talent, signed a two-year, $25-million contract extension, keeping him in Edmonton while providing the Oilers room to manage the salary cap effectively.On the defensive side, Jake Walman agreed to a four-year deal worth $7 million per season, ensuring he remains a key contributor on the blue line. Veteran Mattias Ekholm also signed a three-year, $4 million per season contract. At 35 years old, Ekholm is taking a pay cut despite a rising NHL salary cap, giving the Oilers a cost-effective solution while maintaining his physical, reliable defensive presence.These moves lock in Edmonton’s top four defensemen, including Darnell Nurse and Evan Bouchard, for at least the next three seasons. While Walman, Ekholm, and Nurse will be in their mid- to late-thirties by the end of their deals, the contracts provide the right balance between experience, team control, and future flexibility.Adding forward depth, the Oilers also signed unrestricted free agent Jack Roslovic to a one-year, $1.5 million deal. Roslovic scored 22 goals last season, tying his career high, and brings versatility as a forward who can contribute up and down the lineup. While he may seek a larger contract next year, his immediate impact strengthens Edmonton’s offensive options.With these new contracts, the Oilers’ projected cap hit for 2026-27 is $86.2 million, well under the expected $104 million salary cap ceiling. By locking in McDavid, Ekholm, Walman, Nurse, and Bouchard, Bowman has eliminated much of the offseason uncertainty and set the stage for a stable, competitive roster.If these strategic signings deliver results on the ice, the Edmonton Oilers could secure their first Stanley Cup since 1990, validating the team’s investment in its core roster. With McDavid, Ekholm, Walman, and other key players locked in, Edmonton now has the stability and depth to compete at the highest level.Also Read: Connor McDavid's mega contract extension now sparks Oilers to strengthen roster with $1.5 addition – Could Jack Roslovic be the key to Edmonton’s future?","Edmonton GM Stan Bowman has been proactive in securing his top talent.

For years, Brady Tkachuk and the Ottawa Senators were often overlooked in the NHL . That perception changed last season when Tkachuk led the Senators to their first playoff appearance in eight years, starred in Amazon’s Faceoff documentary, and appeared on the NHL 26 deluxe edition cover with brother Matthew and father Keith. Now, the Senators captain is focused on one goal: the Stanley Cup.Tkachuk enters the 2025-26 season with a renewed focus. Improving conditioning, controlling emotions, minimizing fights, and producing more points are key priorities. His opening game performance against Tampa Bay reflected this evolution, as he recorded three assists to spark a comeback from a 3-1 deficit to a 5-4 win. His composure sets the tone for the entire team, demonstrating why Ottawa fans rely on him as a leader.Senators coach Travis Green calls Tkachuk “hockey’s unicorn,” praising his rare mix of skill, power, and personality. With new acquisitions like Kurtis MacDermid handling the physical enforcer role, Tkachuk can concentrate on scoring and leading, rather than fighting. This maturity allows him to influence teammates positively while staying focused on results.Brady Tkachuk has transformed into a complete player. Defensively, he skyrocketed from 695th to 128th in expected goals allowed at five-on-five last season, while offensively, he proved clutch with five game-winning goals, including an overtime strike that secured Ottawa’s playoff spot.Off the ice, his philanthropy and community presence have cemented his status as a leader and role model.With rising stars like Tim Stutzle, Jake Sanderson, and Shane Pinto supporting him, the Senators are primed to challenge the Atlantic Division’s elite. Tkachuk’s combination of skill, defensive awareness, conditioning, and leadership makes him the cornerstone of Ottawa’s 2025-26 playoff ambitions.Tkachuk thrives in high-stakes games and has made it clear that he’s addicted to the intensity of playoff-level competition. If he continues to elevate his game while guiding younger stars, the Senators could finally have the captain capable of taking them deep into Stanley Cup contention. With Tkachuk leading by example, Ottawa fans have every reason to believe that this season could mark the team’s rise to prominence in the NHL.Also Read: “We had good chances”: Coach André Tourigny on Utah Mammoth’s hard-fought 2-1 loss to Avalanche","Brady Tkachuk led the Ottawa Senators to their first playoff appearance in eight years last season.

Ja’Marr Chase injury update: Bengals star questionable for Week 6 matchup against Packers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jamarr-chase-injury-update-bengals-star-questionable-for-week-6-matchup-against-packers/articleshow/124462232.cms,"Ja’Marr Chase injury clouds Bengals’ Week 6 offense (Image via: Getty images)

Ja’Marr Chase injury concern grows ahead of Bengals ’ Week 6 matchup vs Packers



Bengals’ offense faces major test if Ja’Marr Chase can’t play in Week 6



The Cincinnati Bengals could be without their biggest offensive weapon when they take on the Green Bay Packers in Week 6. Star wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase has officially been listed as questionable after coming down with an illness late in the week, raising concerns about his availability for Sunday’s game at Paycor Stadium.Chase was initially on the Bengals’ injury report earlier this week for rest purposes, practicing in a limited capacity on Wednesday before returning fully on Thursday. However, on Friday, head coach Zac Taylor revealed that the team’s top receiver had developed an illness and was unable to participate in practice. Taylor confirmed that Chase’s official game status is “questionable,” though the team remains hopeful he’ll be ready to go by kickoff.According to ESPN’s Ben Baby, Taylor stated, “Bengals WR Ja’Marr Chase will be questionable for Sunday’s game, coach Zac Taylor said Missed today with an illness.” Fortunately, Chase did take part in the Bengals’ walkthrough session, which suggests the issue may not be serious. Cincinnati Enquirer reporter Kelsey Conway also noted that Chase was active during team meetings, another encouraging sign for his potential return.Chase’s health is crucial for a Bengals offense that has struggled to find rhythm this season. With Cincinnati currently on a three-game losing streak, the team desperately needs its All-Pro receiver to spark life into its passing attack. Chase has been a consistent difference-maker since entering the league in 2021, forming one of the NFL’s most explosive duos with quarterback Joe Flacco, who is set to make his first start for the Bengals this week.If Chase is unable to play, Tee Higgins would likely assume the WR1 role, with rookie Andre Iosivas and tight ends Mike Gesicki and Noah Fant seeing more targets. However, losing Chase’s deep-threat ability and red-zone presence would significantly impact Cincinnati’s offensive strategy against Green Bay’s secondary.While the Bengals remain optimistic that Chase will recover in time, his illness adds an unwelcome layer of uncertainty ahead of a must-win matchup. All eyes will be on pregame warmups in Cincinnati as fans await confirmation on whether Ja’Marr Chase will suit up and help lead the Bengals’ push to end their losing streak.Also Read: Tampa Bay Buccaneers face injury setback: Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, and Bucky Irving status questionable for Week 6","Cincinnati Bengals star wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase has been listed as questionable for Sunday’s game against the Green Bay Packers.

What was meant to be a thumbs-up quickly became a middle finger, sparking widespread attention on social media. Speaking to 105.3 The Fan, Jones clarified, “I put up the wrong show of hand. The intention was thumbs up.”Despite his explanation, the NFL enforced the $250,000 fine, in line with league policies on conduct. Sources confirmed that all fine money goes directly to charitable organizations, a detail that Jones welcomed. NFL insider Tom Pelissero tweeted, “$250,000 for a finger, but also for a great cause,” reflecting Jones’ positive outlook on the situation.At 82, Jones has seen it all in professional sports, and this incident hasn’t slowed him down. Rather than focusing on the controversy, he is keeping his attention on the Cowboys’ 2-2-1 record and the upcoming matchup against the Carolina Panthers.Fans may have noticed the viral clip, but for Jones, the priority remains the team’s performance and long-term success.This episode highlights a recurring theme in the NFL, where high-profile owners often face hefty fines, but Jerry Jones’ response stands out.

Deion Sanders’ Health Struggles Continue



Pilar Sanders Shows Subtle Support



Deion Sanders, the Colorado football coach and NFL Hall of Famer, faced another health scare this week, undergoing surgery for blood clots in his legs. Despite the ongoing challenges, Sanders returned to practice less than a day after the procedure. While his girlfriend Karrueche Tran stayed by his side, his former wife, Pilar Sanders, quietly showed her support in her own way, highlighting the complicated yet enduring family bond.Sanders, 58, has faced persistent health issues over recent years, with this latest procedure marking his 16th surgery, according to his son Deion Sanders Jr. Earlier this week, the coach admitted he was in “a lot of pain” during the Buffaloes’ 35-21 loss to Texas Christian University, where he was seen limping and even removing his left shoe due to discomfort.Christopher Neely of Thee Pregame Network noted on The Morning Run podcast that Sanders remained “involved” and “engaged” during practice, despite likely still feeling the effects of surgery. Accompanied by his son, former NFL player Adam “Pacman” Jones, and Tran, Sanders demonstrated resilience and determination that has defined both his NFL and coaching career.While Deion’s relationship with Pilar has been complicated since their divorce in 2013, she has consistently remained supportive of their children’s athletic careers.The couple shares three sons: Shilo, Shedeur, and Shelomi Sanders. Pilar was seen cheering for Shilo during his preseason games with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Shedeur in his college games with eye-catching outfits, including a bold orange custom “12” look. This week, Pilar shared a photo of herself cooking a delicious meal while wearing a Colorado sweatshirt, captioned, “Chef’s 💋 #legendary.” Though subtle, this gesture reflects her support not only for her ex-husband but also for the family unity surrounding the Buffaloes’ upcoming game.Even amid health setbacks and a complex family dynamic, Deion Sanders’ story shows resilience, dedication, and a network of support that extends beyond football. Fans can expect to see him continue coaching while managing his health, with loved ones quietly cheering him on from the sidelines.Also Read: “It’s all sensational drama”: Bill Belichick sets record straight on UNC job drama, says quitting was never even a thought","Deion Sanders, the Colorado football coach and NFL Hall of Famer, underwent surgery for blood clots in his legs this week.

It was a dream start for India in the semifinals of BWF World Junior Mixed Team Championships in Guwahati on Friday. The junior shuttlers – first the doubles pair of Bhargav Ram Arigela and Viswa Tej Gobburu, followed by the exploits of a below-par Unnati Hooda – dominated Court 1 of National Centre of Excellence at the start of the opening set against Indonesia.But the defending champions’ junior world No. 1 player in boys singles, Mohammaad Zaki Ubaidillah, turned things around by beating Rounak Chouhan and led his team’s thwarting of the hosts’ ambitions in a manner that they could not recover from.In the end, India had to settle for bronze after a 35-45, 21-45 defeat as Indonesia set up a clash with top seeds China, for the third time in a row.“Today, the Indonesian team was better than us in all departments,” India doubles coach Ivan Sozonov told TOI from Guwahati.The Russian couldn’t have been more right. India did start strong and were on level terms for much of the first set and the mixed doubles combination of Lalramsanga C and Vishakha Toppo raised hopes of a fightback as they first drew level at 28-28.But the Indonesian combination of Ikhsan Pramudya and Rinjani Nastine wrested back the initiative and Nastine then teamed up with Riska Anggraini to beat Reshika U and Vennala K and wrap up the set 45-35.“In the first doubles, had we managed to go into the last doubles with a few points lead, we could have put some pressure on them. But that did not happen,” added Sozonov.India’s level dipped further in the second set. The Indonesians tweaked their opening men’s doubles pair and the change worked taking Indonesia to 9-2.It was one-way traffic from there on as Hooda, expected to pull India ahead, couldn’t get going against Thalita Wiryawan and Ubaidillah put the Indonesians further ahead in men’s singles.India’s slim hopes of recovery were further dashed in mixed doubles, with Pramudya-Nastine outplaying Lalramsanga-Toppo. The Indians switched the final women’s doubles, bringing in Aanya Bisht with Angel Punera but that made little difference with Nastine and Anggraini comfortably taking their team into the final with a 45-21 score.Meanwhile, China held off a spirited charge from Japan, squeezing through 45-42 at the end of an entertaining third set to win 2-1.The Indians will now shift focus on the individual championship that will begin on Monday.","Indonesia beat India 35-45, 21-45 in the semifinals of the World Junior Mixed Team Championships in Guwahati on Friday.

Why Munetaka Murakami Fits the Phillies’ Vision

My Final Thoughts on this Move

The Philadelphia Phillies are entering a crucial offseason following their heartbreaking National League Division Series loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. After years of deep postseason runs ending in disappointment, major roster changes are expected. At the center of attention is free agent designated hitter Kyle Schwarber - and whether Philadelphia can bring him back for 2026 and beyond.Despite the organization’s desire to re-sign Schwarber, the task won’t be easy. Several teams across the league are expected to pursue the 56-home-run slugger. The Philadelphia Phillies, however, still hold the advantage in negotiations, given Schwarber’s success and connection to the team’s culture. But if they fail to retain him, there’s already a name surfacing as a possible replacement: Japanese superstar Munetaka Murakami.According to MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand, Munetaka Murakami - a 25-year-old corner infielder from Japan’s Yakult Swallows - is expected to be posted this offseason. Murakami, who once hit 56 home runs in a single season (2022), could bring his elite power-hitting ability to Major League Baseball as early as 2026.Feinsand wrote, “Nikkan Sports reported this week that the Yankees, Mets, Phillies, and Mariners are among the teams that could make a big push for Murakami.” (H/t: Sporting News)While the Philadelphia Phillies have previously lost out on major Japanese free agents like Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Munetaka Murakami represents a unique opportunity. His combination of youth, raw power, and consistent offensive production makes him an ideal fit for a Phillies team that desperately needs another bat in the lineup.In the 2022 season, Munetaka Murakami recorded 56 home runs and a 1.168 OPS - numbers comparable to Schwarber’s best MLB seasons. This year, despite limited action, he still managed 22 home runs and 47 RBIs in just 56 games, maintaining a stellar 1.043 OPS.If Murakami joins the Philadelphia Phillies, several lineup adjustments could follow. According to Feinsand, “The Phillies could slot Murakami in as a DH to replace Kyle Schwarber (who is also set to be a free agent), move Bryce Harper back to the outfield to open first base or possibly trade third baseman Alec Bohm, who is entering the final year of arbitration.”That leaves the Phillies with a few clear options:1. Murakami as Designated Hitter: A direct Schwarber replacement to keep the power intact.2. Bryce Harper’s Position Shift: Moving Harper back to the outfield would open up first base for Murakami.3. Alec Bohm Trade: Trading Bohm could create roster flexibility and free up arbitration salary space.The most optimistic scenario for Philadelphia remains retaining Schwarber while potentially adding Murakami. This would give the team unmatched power depth heading into 2026. However, if Schwarber signs a massive deal elsewhere 0 which seems likely after his career year - the Phillies will have no choice but to look elsewhere for production.Schwarber’s impact on the Philadelphia Phillies lineup has been undeniable. Losing him would create a major void, but Murakami’s addition could soften that blow with a younger and equally powerful hitter ready to step up.The Phillies’ front office, led by Dave Dombrowski, has made it clear that the team needs more offensive firepower after the NLDS loss to Los Angeles. Munetaka Murakami not only brings power but also long-term potential as he enters his prime years.Adding Murakami could give the Phillies:• A consistent left-handed power bat• Positional flexibility across the infield and DH• A fresh offensive spark following postseason disappointmentWhile bringing back Kyle Schwarber remains the priority, Philadelphia’s reported interest in Munetaka Murakami shows they’re preparing for all outcomes. After years of near-misses, the Philadelphia Phillies are determined to reload rather than rebuild.Feinsand’s report paints a clear picture - if Schwarber leaves, Murakami could become the next big name to light up Citizens Bank Park. Whether it’s a trade involving Alec Bohm, a Harper position shift, or a full-fledged roster reshuffle, change is inevitable.Also read: MLB Trade Rumors: Philadelphia Phillies Predicted to Part Ways With $100 Million Superstar in a Blockbuster Free Agency Move The Philadelphia Phillies can’t afford another offseason of standing still.With Munetaka Murakami on their radar, they might just have found their next 56-home-run star.","Munetaka Murakami, a 25-year-old corner infielder from Japan’s Yakult Swallows, is expected to be posted this offseason.
