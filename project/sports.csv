Nitish Does It Again: Alliance Back With Landmark 202 Seats

PATNA: National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won a stunning landslide in Bihar, with the governing coalition headed by chief minister Nitish Kumar bagging 202 of 243 assembly seats in a hugely one-sided outcome that underscores the JDU boss's political resilience despite two decades in office, and PM Narendra Modi's sway over voters, while deflating the Grand Alliance's Rahul Gandhi-led campaign against ""vote theft"".The overwhelming victory puts BJP on a firm footing ahead of approaching encounters, especially in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu.The outcome, which surpassed NDA's own expectations, is seen as a pro-incumbency vote conveying gratitude to Nitish Kumar, who put the state back on track after a widely perceived 15 years of anarchy, and marks a ""coming of age"" moment for women voters who turned out in huge numbers to reciprocate Nitish-led NDA govt's measures to empower them using a whole spectrum of means. It also speaks to the success of a strategy to overpower the numerically robust Muslim-Yadav combination with a broader tent covering ""most backward classes"", ""non-Yadav backwards"", extremely backward classes, and significant sections of Dalits.It was the first time that women - including possibly those from the Yadav community - in a supposedly ""socially backward"" state made themselves felt as an independent electoral category.The landslide should potentially put Nitish Kumar on the way to becoming one of India's longest-serving CMs.Bihar voters disregarded concerns about CM Nitish Kumar's health and past political flip-flops to vote overwhelmingly for him. JDU's score of 85, which would have looked improbable after the underwhelming 43 it managed five years ago, was facilitated also by perfect coordination with BJP.BJP, fuelled by Modi's popularity in the state, has for the first time emerged as the single largest party in the state, an achievement that may encourage many in the party to stake claim to the chief ministership. BJP was also the glue for the coalition.Other members of the NDA alliance - Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party, Union minister Jitanram Manjhi's HAM and Upendra Kushwaha's RLM - contributed to the thumping win with spectacular strike rates.In contrast, the rival RJD-led Mahagathbandhan fared poorly. The Tejashwi-led RJD barely escaped the political ignominy of slumping below its poorest score of 22, which it had crashed to in 2010. Congress, in keeping with what has become a pattern, again fared disastrously, plumbing to an embarrassing single-digit score of 6. CPI-ML's streak of successes since 2020 also came to a halt, with the leftist formation winning 2.Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM has secured 5 seats, but the significance of its success stretches beyond the numbers in that it reflects a yearning among Muslims to diversity options beyond ""secular"" options led by non-Muslims.The coronation of Tejashwi, a CM-in-waiting for five years now, has been further delayed. He now must contend with the risk of BJP making overtures to Yadavs, with RJD having been out of govt for almost 20 years now. Nitish has never dropped his attempt to claim the Muslim vote and may redouble his efforts.In terms of national politics, the Gandhi-led Congress is the bigger loser, with his ""vote theft"" claim not getting any traction with Bihar voters. Congress responded to the shock by sticking to its guns. But it may come under pressure from within to revisit the drawing board.The biggest letdown, however, was Prashant Kishor, whose Jan Suraaj Party drew a blank, proving yet again that a successful career in political consultancy does not automatically translate into one's own political success.","National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won a stunning landslide in Bihar.

‘Not Just Congress’: Tharoor Calls Out RJD Amid NDA’s Big Bihar Lead

Also read |

NDA's three-fourth majority in the third most populous state, its best performance since 2010, comes as a major endorsement of the 'double-engine plank' of the alliance and has validated the coalition's belief that an opposition campaign centred on targeting PM Narendra Modi carries a stiff cost.The coalition contested the polls as a united family, blurring the 'symbols divide', with smaller allies making significant contributions. Buoyed by the emphatic win despite the Mahagathbandhan's bitter campaign accusing PM Modi of 'vote chori', BJP strategists said the attack backfired - much like the 'chowkidar chor hai' slogan of 2019.A senior party functionary added that the fourth successive win in state elections points to the desire of the electorate to help Modi make up for the surprising sub-par performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. NDA's landslide victory, with BJP's second-best performance and strike rate ever, confirm that the charisma of Modi, the alliance mascot who has completed 11 years in office, remains intact.NDA's previous best tally was 206 of the 243 seats in 2010, with JDU winning 115 and BJ. This time, BJP has emerged as the single largest party. However, party leaders have shown commitment to abide by 'coalition dharma' and reconcile with the continuation of Nitish Kumar as CM - another testament to the fact that stitching alliances is not enough; parties must equally focus on running them smoothly.Unity among allies was so evident that even their poll offices were set up as those of the alliance, not individual parties.Besides, most rallies were held in the name of the alliance, with PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah addressing workers of all parties rather than confining themselves to BJP or its bastions.Although Nitish Kumar had walked away from the alliance in the past, top BJP netas, including PM Modi and Shah, set the narrative for his entire 20 years in office, floating the slogan of 'Mangal Raj' as contrast to Lalu-Rabri's 'Jungle-Raj'. Central and state welfare schemes - particularly those benefitting women - formed the campaign's core, while reminders of the 'dark years' of misgovernance helped consolidate voter sentiment. BJP netas also accepted Nitish as the alliance leader, ignoring apprehensions about the chief minister's health.The PM addressed 13 rallies and held a roadshow in Patna. Throughout the campaign, he conveyed a message of unity to NDA constituents by interacting with them as the campaign kicked off and ironing out differences among them after the announcement of the alliance's candidates.","The coalition contested the polls as a united family, blurring the'symbols divide', with smaller allies making significant contributions.

NEW DELHI/PATNA: Before these polls, Chirag Paswan had described himself as ""sabji mein namak"" (salt in vegetables), which is essential to any political broth.Winning 19 of the 29 seats his party contested, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief proved his mettle again in Bihar as his performance propelled NDA past the 200-seat mark. What makes the showing more significant is that LJP (RV) has wrested 17 seats from Mahagathbandhan despite talk of discontent around candidate selection.Chirag's rise in Bihar became evident during seat-sharing talks, when his party got a fair share despite only one of its 143 candidates winning during the 2020 assembly polls. His bargaining power came from the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, when LJP(RV) won all five seats it fought.At a time when the fortunes of other Dalit netas like Mayawati and Jitan Ram Manjhi have been on the decline, the son of former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan has emer-ged a prominent face. The victory has also virtually put an end to the claim his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras laid to Paswan senior's legacy. Though Paras has been claiming that his Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party is part of NDA, the coalition gave a clear signal when it did not give him a single seat.Before his political plunge, Chirag made his Bollywood debut in 2011 with 'Miley Naa Miley Hum', starring with Kangana Ranaut. In 2014, he convinced his father to ally with BJP. Chirag's political journey began in 2014, when he won Jamui Lok Sabha seat. He retained it in 2019 before shifting to his father's stronghold, Hajipur, in 2024 and becoming a Union minister. The 42-year-old sees a bigger role for himself in 2030.

LJP (RV)'s previous performances

Chirag vs Tejashwi in 2030?

NEW DELHI: The two senior Bihar NDA constituents — the BJP and chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) — may have swept the assembly elections between themselves. But it was Union minister Chirag Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), which brought in the extra seats and powered the coalition’s march beyond the 200-seat mark.Though the counting of votes is still underway and results are still being declared, the LJP (RV) has won or is leading in 19 constituencies. If it wins all those seats, it would end with a strike rate of 68 per cent and would have a won a whopping 1800 per cent more seats than in 2020.The NDA’s decision to allocate 29 constituencies to the LJP (Ram Vilas) had drawn attention — and some unease — within the alliance. The two smaller partners, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and the Rashtriya Lok Morcha (RLP), were each given six seats to contest.The LJP (RV) was allotted the following assembly constituencies: Govindganj, Simri Bakhtiarpur, Darauli, Garkha, Sahebpur Kamal, Bakhri, Parbatta, Nathnagar, Paliganj, Brahmapur, Dehri, Balrampur, Makhdumpur, Obra, Sugauli, Belsand, Marhaura, Sherghati, Bodhgaya, Rajauli, Govindpur, Bochha, Bakhtiarpur, Fatuha, Bahadurganj, Mahua, Chenari, Maner and Kasba.However, the party ultimately contested 28 seats, as the nomination of its Marhaura candidate, Seema Singh, was rejected.The LJP (RV) chose not to field a replacement, and the NDA instead extended support to independent candidate Ankit Kumar.The party was established in 2021 following a power tussle between Chirag Paswan and his uncle, Pashupati Kumar Paras, which resulted in the split of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) into two factions. The faction led by Paswan was named the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) in memory of his late father, Ram Vilas Paswan, who passed away in 2020, while the group headed by Paras came to be known as the Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party.Also read: 'Gamcha' in the air: PM Modi leads celebrations after NDA secures sweeping victory in Bihar elections- Watch Formed in 2000 by Ram Vilas Paswan, the original LJP made a strong debut in the February 2005 Bihar assembly elections, winning 29 seats (178 contested) in a contest that produced a fractured verdict. However, its tally dropped to 10 (202 contested) in the re-election held in October the same year. The party’s strength further declined to three seats in 2010 and just two in 2015. In the 2020 assembly polls, despite being an NDA ally, the LJP contested 134 seats independently, winning only one — but inflicting considerable damage on the Janata Dal (United).The success of the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) has vindicated what was once seen as a risky move, firmly consolidating Chirag Paswan’s standing within the NDA. The outcome is likely to further endear the Hajipur MP to the BJP leadership — particularly Prime Minister Narendra Modi — whom Paswan has described himself as being “Hanuman” to. The young actor-turned-politician’s rising influence could also set the stage for a future political face-off with Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav for Bihar’s chief ministerial post in the 2030 assembly elections.","Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) has won or is leading in 19 constituencies.

NEW DELHI: Many surprising wins and losses marked Friday's results as Bihar finalised its mandate, delivering a sweeping victory to the NDA and extending its nearly two-decade-long dominance under chief minister Nitish Kumar, who has switched alliances several times over the years very conveniently.What was expected to be a close contest between the ruling NDA and the opposition Mahagathbandhan instead turned into a decisive, one-sided mandate. The NDA is poised to comfortably cross the 200-seat mark in the 243-member assembly, while the Mahagathbandhan has collapsed to under 40 seats.The grand old party -- Congress, once a major force in the state, has been reduced to a near-wipeout, winning hardly about 10 per cent of the 61 seats it contested.The verdict also produced several striking wins and unexpected defeats across Bihar. While JD(U) strongman Anant Singh retained his bastion, many prominent figures in Patna failed to secure victories.Mahagathbandhan’s chief ministerial face and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav eventually retained his family stronghold of Raghopur in Vaishali district after a tense, fluctuating contest. Throughout the day, he alternated between leads and trails, making the outcome far from the comfortable victory his family traditionally enjoyed from this seat.In 2020, Tejashwi had secured Raghopur with ease. He won again this time, but without the dominance that pollsters or supporters expected.JD(U) heavyweight Anant Singh once again proved his unshakable hold over Mokama. Despite being jailed in connection with the recent killing of Jan Suraaj worker Dular Chand Yadav and facing repeated allegations of muscle power, Singh secured yet another victory.Just days before polling, he was taken into custody in the same case, yet voters reaffirmed their trust in him as they have many times before. Known for his trademark sunglasses and brief, punchy remarks to the media, Singh emerged victorious even from behind bars.Folk singer and influencer Maithili Thakur, contesting her first election on a BJP ticket, won comfortably from Alinagar by more than 11,000 votes, defeating veteran RJD leader Binod Mishra. This makes her the youngest MLA in the Bihar assembly.The BJP’s gamble on her reach and cultural appeal paid off—the party has won this seat for the first time since 2008. Alinagar, in Darbhanga district and part of the Darbhanga Lok Sabha constituency, saw a three-way contest involving Thakur, Mishra, and Jan Suraaj’s Biplaw Chaudhary.Bhojpuri star Khesari Lal Yadav, fielded by the RJD from Chapra in Saran district, failed to convert his popularity into votes. Unlike other film stars who transitioned successfully into politics—such as Ravi Kishan, Manoj Tiwari, or Dinesh Lal “Nirahua” Yadav—Khesari struggled from the beginning.He eventually lost by over 10,000 votes to BJP’s Chhoti Kumari. For the RJD, which had backed him despite his limited political experience, his defeat was a major embarrassment.Tej Pratap Yadav, son of former CM Lalu Prasad Yadav , estranged from the RJD, and founder of the Janshakti Janata Dal (JJD) suffered a significant defeat in Mahua. Contesting from the same district as his brother Tejashwi and from a seat he once held, Tej Pratap was unable to mobilise support for his new party, resulting in a heavy loss.In Simri Bakhtiarpur, RJD leader and sitting MLA Yusuf Salahuddin, son of veteran politician and former parliamentarian Mehboob Ali Kaiser, was defeated by Sanjay Kumar Singh of the Chirag Paswan-led LJP (RV). Sanjay won by more than 7,000 votes, marking another high-profile setback for the RJD.","The NDA is poised to comfortably cross the 200-seat mark in the 243-member assembly.

NEW DELHI: Congress's abysmal show threatens to again trap the party in the rut that it has been trying to climb out of since 2014 - an endless cycle of recriminations, dissent and defections, and whispered demands for change of personnel and strategy.Coming against the backdrop of shocking losses in Haryana and Maharashtra, this setback will only harden the belief among party functionaries that the future remains bleak, a concern that had triggered an exodus of popular faces between 2014 and 2023.There is now a serious worry the defeat will revive public airing of grievances from restive souls within, a strong possibility given that many have been upset with the party's focus in recent months. A couple of popular faces are even said to be waiting for their opportunity.An ominous warning came from an unlikely corner. Mumtaz Patel, daughter of the late Ahmed Patel, posted on X: ""It's time to look within and accept reality. Till when will countless loyal ground workers who have stayed with the party through thick and thin wait to see success... it's failure after failure due to power concentrated in the hands of a few who are totally disconnected with ground reality...these same people will be rewarded again and again because they have made themselves indispensable with their control and power. ""MP Shashi Tharoor minced no words either: ""I have been talking to people...our party leaders must do some very serious analysis of where things went wrong ... how our organisation functions."" Congress veteran Digvijaya Singh said ""elections are about intensive public contact at booth level"" while Karnataka state chief and deputy CM DK Shivakumar advocated the need to work out a new strategy.After the high of the 2024 Lok Sabha contest where it emerged with its dignity intact despite an uphill battle, Congress has been on an uninterrupted decline, losing Haryana and Maharashtra, states it was expected to win, and finishing with a pathetic tally in J&K.Bihar is yet more proof that Congress has lost its way electorally. In a typical paradox that plagues Congress, the party was a fringe player in Bihar, but its national appeal as embodiment of anti-BJP politics provided the base from which local powerhouse RJD was to fire. But even as a side player, it could not fulfil its promise of being a strong supporting ally (like it did in Jharkhand last year). This time, its tally was in single digits, even lower than the 19 seats it won out of the 71 contested in 2020.",Congress's abysmal show threatens to again trap the party in the rut that it has been trying to climb out of since 2014.

NEW DELHI: The five seats won by Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM in Seemanchal region of east Bihar, where Muslim voters have a substantial presence, reflect the community's willingness to diversify its options in areas where it feels secure that experimentation may not benefit BJP.Results show that AIMIM won five of nine constituencies with more than 40% Muslim population, with its Muslim candidates securing decisive victories. They defeated four Muslim candidates fielded either by Mahagathbandhan or JDU, and in one seat, the party defeated a Hindu candidate from BJP. In three of the five victories, AIMIM defeated NDA candidates, including two from JDU. The five seats won by AIMIM are Baisi, Jokihat, Bahadurganj, Kochadhaman and Amour.The party also fielded seven candidates in constituencies where Muslim population ranges between 25% and 40%, but it failed to win any of these seats, which went to NDA. Except for Congress, which won Kishanganj seat, neither RJD nor CPIML-Liberation registered a victory in the belt - marking a shift from the decades-long pattern of Muslims backing an RJD-led alliance. The outcome points to something larger - a desire to look beyond Hindu-led parties and prefer an outfit seen as their ""own,"" even at the risk of aiding BJP and its allies.This pattern first surfaced in the 2020 elections when Muslims in Seemanchal voted for Owaisi despite accusations from RJD and Congress that he was BJP's ""B-team."" AIMIM had then won five seats, though four later defected to RJD. Yet the party's base does not appear eroded. Owaisi has tapped into the community's ""sense of hurt"" over what political scientists term ""invisibilisation,"" pointing out how secular parties seek Muslim votes but hesitate to offer ""fair"" representation. The results indicate that many in the community are listening - something that may, in the future, force secular parties to confront tough choices over greater Muslim representation.","Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM won five seats in Seemanchal region of east Bihar.

NEW DELHI/PATNA: From a low of 43 seats in 2020 to a high of 85, an almost 100% jump as the counting progressed on Friday, Janata Dal (United) has delivered a knockout punch to the naysayers and burnished its credentials as a lead BJP ally in a politically crucial Hindi heartland state.The tally will be the second highest for CM Nitish Kumar-led party, which had won 115 seats in alliance with BJP in 2010 in the 243-member assembly in an electoral battle that had annihilated the RJD-led opposition on a scale similar to this election's.JDU entered the political fray amid rising skepticism over its strength as questions mounted over the health of its mascot Nitish and the virtually non-existent second line of leadership, rooted in its traditional vote bank drawn from sections of OBCs, EBCs and Dalits.Its lowest ever tally in 2020 came largely due to Chirag Paswan-led LJP's fielding its candidates mostly against JDU, dealing it a hammer blow.Its strong show has opened a narrow path for JDU to make overtures to voting blocs like Muslims and Yadavs who have long been loyal to RJD but will turn increasingly restive as another spell out of power looms for them, with the main opposition party looking at an uncertain future.Muslims have already displayed their thinning patience with MGB by backing AIMIM in substantial numbers in this poll and have maintained some goodwill for Nitish despite his alliance with BJP and their recent protest against his support to the amendments in Waqf Act. BJP, too, in the past has reached out to Yadavs and Union minister Nityanand Rai, a member from the community, enjoys an important position in the party.As JDU prepared for the 2025 poll and for the first time contested the same number of seats, and not more, as BJP, questions were raised whether history would repeat itself and NDA would again have to bank disproportionately on BJP to cross the majority mark.However, it is a testament to Nitish's appeal that what was considered a vulnerable stage of his nearly five-decade-long political journey sparked a wave of support for him among his supporters, especially women who have benefitted from his multiple schemes, with the cash assistance of Rs 10,000 to 1.5 crore of them being the latest.Steadfast support from BJP, which has also made inroads among JDU's traditional supporters, has also helped.The regional party's win on 12 Lok Sabha seats in 2024 made it the second largest ally of BJP after TDP and helped it claw back some of its lost influence as the saffron party lost majority support and had to depend on partners to form the govt at the Centre.JDU's stupendous performance in the poll, however, has dispelled doubts about its popularity. At the same time, its future is tied to Nitish's health, though the party has dismissed questions on this count.","Janata Dal (United) has delivered a knockout punch to the naysayers and burnished its credentials as a lead BJP ally.

NEW DELHI: The Bihar results have delivered a major blow to CPI(Marxist-Leninist) Liberation with its double-digit tally of 12 seats in 2020 plummeting to mere 2 seats - Karakat and Paliganj - out of the 20 it contested this time. The party that traces its beginnings to mass movements and grassroots mobilisation among the landless and marginalised failed to retain even its strongholds.While describing the election outcome as “unnatural and not a reflection of ground reality” and claiming that the result was facilitated by deletion and addition of voters and by dispensing of the dole to women, party general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya did acknowledge the need for parties in the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ to “introspect” on this severe setback.The CPI(ML) certainly needed to take a closer look at its strategy. Not only has it lost in its strongholds, the party which played a crucial role in keeping together the rather fragile alliance is set to lose its place as one of the grouping’s key anchors because of the abysmal performance.In what was seen as a strong comeback in 2020, the Left party had secured 12 of the 19 seats it contested as part of the Mahagathbandhan, emerging as a critical force with grassroots influence in belts like Bhojpur, Siwan and Arrah.Its influence in the alliance was evident ahead of the current polls. Through the power-play over ticket distribution and declaration of Tejaswi Yadav as the CM face of the alliance, one saw Bhattacharya playing a key role in ironing out differences between RJD and Congress.It is also felt that CPI(ML)’s going along with its Mahagathbandhan partner RJD’s decision to field Osama Shahab from Raghunathpur would not have gone unnoticed among the core support base of the Left party, impacting its image as a crusader for the marginalised. Osama’s late father and former Siwan MP Mohammad Shahabuddin was accused of ordering the 1997 killing of student activist Chandrashekhar, who was associated with the Left party and seen as his potential political rival.While CPI(ML) candidates won merely two seats - Paliganj and Karakat, the party lost in Agiaon (SC) by a narrow margin of 95 votes. In three other seats - Balrampur, Dumraon and Zeeradei, the margin of defeat was less than 3,000. The party contested 20 seats this time and its vote share sands at close to 3%.The other Left parties too have performed poorly, with CPI(M) winning just 1 of 4 seats as against 2 last time and CPI, which had won 2 seats last time, failing to open its account though it contested 6.Reflecting on the verdict the CPI(ML) general secretary said that the outcome ""has the scars of SIR all over it. The role of the unprecedented money transfer operation amounting to Rs 30,000 crore among a beneficiary population of 3 crore defying all notions of election ethics and model code of conduct must also be taken into account.""""A virtual repeat of the 2010 outcome after fifteen years when the credibility of the Nitish Kumar government has touched an all-time low and the Modi government too suffered a major loss of support just a year ago defies credulity. We will undertake a thorough analysis of the outcome and draw necessary lessons,"" Bhattacharya added.CPI(M) general secretary MA Baby described the result as a setback for the ‘mahagathbandhan’ and accused the NDA of utilising the state machinery and resorting to all sorts of manipulation including the Rs 10,000 cash transfer to bank accounts of women beneficiaries ahead of polls. The party in a statement said that the ""NDA benefited from the polarising communal and cateist rhetoric of its leaders, including the Prime Minister and home minister"". “All this drowned out the issues like unemployment and even vote chori raised by the mahagathbandhan,” Baby said. However, he called for introspection over how key players could have put up a more united fight to counter the NDA in the elections.A leader said that while the Mahagathbandhan was able to raise the ‘vote chori’ issue with the people effectively, somewhere the alliance on ground was unable to mobilise the people to come out and vote to seek transparency in the polling system.The Left party leaders also cite that the way RJD and Congress delayed resolving differences over ticket distribution sent out a negative message about the mahagathbandhan lacking unity. This was further aggravated by what was referred to as “friendly fights” on nearly 10 seats where no consensus could be reached.",The Bihar results have delivered a major blow to CPI(Marxist-Leninist) Liberation. Its double-digit tally of 12 seats in 2020 plummeting to mere 2 seats.

NEW DELHI: Staring at a political abyss in the face of continued decline post-2014 - hastened after 2019 - a flailing opposition came together to give itself the collective moniker 'INDIA', vowing to stick together and fight jointly. It enjoyed a surge in fortunes and gave the governing BJP alliance a scare in 2024.The INDIA bloc - stacked with competitive allies - managed to find a fomula that allowed members to back each other despite the odd flaring up of contradictions. It helped the bloc in Jharkhand and J&K last year though it failed to rescue them in Maharashtra where Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress came up rather as a squabbling team.Bihar was a crucial test for the opposition bloc. RJD, the lead player, was to take along Congress, Left and caste outfits to challenge the JDU-BJP combine. That it came a cropper is bound to raise questions for opposition as key contests await the INDIA bloc in Bengal and Tamil Nadu.TMC chief Mamata Banerjee has made it clear that Congress is too weak to offer any value in an alliance, repeating the 2024 line when the two contested as rivals despite being part of the same umbrella nationally.The immediate challenge for Congress is the Bengal dilemma - should it target Mamata or BJP.A crucial overlapping constituency between TMC and Congress is the large minority populace in Bengal - and it would present a serious conundrum for Congress, which has been quick to dismiss such ""secular"" rivals in other states as BJP's ""B-team"".Tamil Nadu is a curious case, too. While alliance is a settled subject, with Congress brass and DMK supremo M K Stalin being on ""my brother"" terms, local Congress is chafing at the 'domineering' attitude of 'big brother'. Local Congress functionaries have been demanding that the terms of partnership be rewritten. And Congress argues that its 8% vote would be critical for DMK in case there's an AIADMK-headed joint opposition.Some are already blaming Congress's hard bargaining with RJD - as also vice versa - for delaying the campaign and joint strategy plan in Bihar. The party may have to return to ""sacrifice"" mode - as in 2024 - to help put the alliance back on track.","Bihar was a crucial test for the opposition bloc.

Even if you win, do not gamble; the bait may be made of gold, yet what good

Is it to the fish that swallows it?

I have often wondered why someone as virtuous as Yudhishthira should resort to gambling so fervently — to the point of pledging Draupadi herself. Was he a compulsive gambler? Why could he not resist the temptation to play further, even as his fortune slipped away?Thetells us he was lured, that destiny led him to the dice. Yet once seated at the table, it was not fate but frenzy that consumed him — the shimmer of chance, the intoxication of gamble. He played ceaselessly, mindlessly, raising the stakes until he lost every possession, every relationship, every ounce of dignity. In that hall of deceit, Yudhishthira was not conquered by Sakuni but by his own delusion — the belief that one more throw of the dice might change his fate.Modern science offers an explanation. Gambling activates the brain’s reward system much like drugs or alcohol do. The tragedy of gambling-related suicides has become a quiet epidemic.When I was very young, I watched a Shivaji Ganesan–Padmini film titled. A couple, long childless, are finally blessed with a son. The boy becomes their world. One day, the father takes him to a wedding while the mother stays back, warning him repeatedly to take care of the child.At the wedding hall, the father meets old friends playing cards and succumbs soon. The clink of coins, the rhythm of the cards — all blur into one. His eyes gleam with a fever that blinds him to everything else. The child, forgotten, wanders away into the night. The rest of the film is a long search — for the boy, for forgiveness, for peace. What I still remember is the extraordinary acting of legend Shivaji Ganesan that depicts how gamblers succumb to temptation.Thiruvalluvar, in his timeless wisdom, captures this folly with haunting precision:In the same chapter, Valluvar condemns gambling across all the ten couplets. So gambling clubs existed as an organised business even two millennia ago! Today, gambling houses are not tucked away in alleys; they are glowing icons on our phones. Betting apps promise easy money, masking risk as entertainment. Once I took a cab from airport to my office in Mumbai. The cab driver, mistaking me for an IT professional, asked if I could ‘hack’ a gambling app. I was appalled and asked why. He had lost 12.7 lakh rupees on one such app and if I could help hack that app, he could recover his losses. I was stunned — not just by the scale of loss, but by the desperation that drives people to such extremes.These digital platforms blur the line between play and peril. What begins as harmless fun often turns into addiction — a slow erosion of willpower.Perhaps the only remedy is to recognise gambling as what it is — a snare. As Valluvar warned, even victory in gambling is defeat in disguise. The bait may glitter, but to swallow it is to lose everything that matters — as Yudhishthira learned, too late, in the echoing silence after the last throw of the dice. He has lost Draupadi.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125322309,imgsize-89688,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/125322309.jpg"

Hornets’ Offensive Struggles Highlight Ball’s Importance

Tough Road Test Against the Milwaukee Bucks

LaMelo Ball’s anticipated return has become one of the main storylines as the Charlotte Hornets prepare to face the Milwaukee Bucks on November 14, 2025. After missing significant time, the Hornets are hoping that Ball’s presence will spark a much-needed shift in their early-season momentum. With the team struggling to find consistency on both ends of the floor, the timing of his expected comeback could not be more critical.Charlotte enters this matchup at 3-7, clearly feeling the effects of playing without their franchise cornerstone. Ball’s ability to orchestrate the offense, set the game’s tempo, and elevate the scoring around him has been sorely missed. Tonight’s contest presents both a challenge and an opportunity for the Hornets to regain their footing in the Eastern Conference.LaMelo Ball is expected to suit up for tonight’s game after being listed as “probable” following a five-game stretch on the sidelines due to a right ankle impingement. His recovery has been handled with caution, given his history of ankle-related setbacks. The Hornets monitored his progress closely through limited practice involvement, targeted rehab sessions, and strength-building work with the team’s G League affiliate.Ball’s return is viewed as a positive progression in his rehabilitation, with both the medical staff and coaching team encouraged by his improvements. Head coach Charles Lee noted that Ball’s strength and movement have been improving daily, adding that the team has been focused on ensuring long-term durability rather than rushing him back prematurely.In LaMelo Ball’s absence, the Hornets have struggled to maintain rhythm offensively. His season averages of 23.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 9.8 assists reflect not only his scoring ability but also his central role as the team’s primary playmaker. Without him, Charlotte has lacked fluidity, consistency, and leadership on the court.The team’s record during this stretch underscores those challenges, with the Hornets failing to generate the offensive balance needed to close out games. LaMelo Ball’s playmaking is essential not only for creating scoring opportunities but also for stabilizing the team during crucial moments.Charlotte will lean heavily on Ball’s expected return as they head into a difficult matchup against a Bucks squad that has performed strongly at home. Although Ball is likely to play, the Hornets are still dealing with other injuries, including the absence of Josh Green, who remains sidelined.Fans are eager to see whether Ball can make an immediate impact upon his return. As Charlotte attempts to turn around its early-season slump, his presence gives the team a fighting chance to rediscover its competitive edge.Also read: Is Giannis Antetokounmpo playing tonight vs the Charlotte Hornets?

Milwaukee’s Dependence on Its Superstar

What to Expect Tonight from the Milwaukee Bucks vs Charlotte Hornets Game (November 14, 2025)

as the Milwaukee Bucks prepare for another important matchup against the Charlotte Hornets. Listed as probable, the two-time MVP appears on track to play barring any last-minute issues during warm-ups. Milwaukee is in a tight battle near the top of the Eastern Conference standings, making every game crucial, especially with several roster injuries.The Bucks opted to rest Giannis in the previous game against the Hornets due to a flare-up of his left knee patellar tendinopathy. The condition has been a recurring hurdle throughout the season, requiring careful management to ensure he remains healthy for Milwaukee’s long-term goals. With the team continuing to monitor him closely, tonight’s contest is expected to see him back in action if pregame evaluations go smoothly.Giannis Antetokounmpo’s left knee patellar tendinopathy is not considered a severe injury, but it is persistent and demands consistent load management. The Bucks’ medical staff has reduced his practice workload and strategically limited his minutes whenever necessary.Despite the discomfort, Giannis has remained dominant on the floor in recent weeks, averaging more than 33 points and nearly 12 rebounds per game. His production levels highlight how impactful he remains even while dealing with ongoing knee irritation.In the latest injury update released on November 14, 2025, the Bucks officially listed him as probable for tonight’s rematch with Charlotte. His participation in warm-ups and light drills suggested that he’s trending in the right direction. While the team remains cautious, the expectation is that Giannis will suit up unless he experiences any unforeseen symptoms before tip-off.Milwaukee’s success this season has been closely tied to Giannis’ availability. His two-way dominance elevates the Bucks’ offense and defense, allowing Milwaukee to maintain its competitive edge even while navigating multiple absences elsewhere on the roster. The team continues to be without Kevin Porter Jr., who remains sidelined after right knee meniscus surgery, and Taurean Prince, who is out with a neck strain.Given these injuries, Giannis Antetokounmpo’s return becomes even more important as the team looks to maintain stability in the rotation. Should he play, he is expected to set the tone early, providing the energy and production the Bucks rely on. In the unlikely scenario that he is unable to go, the pressure would shift heavily onto Damian Lillard, Khris Middleton, and Brook Lopez, who would be tasked with carrying both the scoring load and defensive responsibilities.As the Bucks prepare for another showdown with a Hornets team battling inconsistencies and injury issues of its own, Giannis Antetokounmpo’s presence could be the deciding factor. For now, all signs point toward a strong return from Milwaukee’s franchise star in what should be an intense and competitive matchup.","Giannis Antetokounmpo is listed as probable for the Milwaukee Bucks vs Charlotte Hornets game (November 14, 2025) The two-time MVP has been dealing with a flare- up of his left knee patellar tendinopathy.

More coverage on NFL WAGs:

The electric connection between Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski echoes the dynamic spark we see today with Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, offering a vivid lens for comparison. Brady, a seven-time Super Bowl legend, closed out his storied career with three seasons in Tampa Bay, hanging up his cleats as a Buccaneer in 2023. Gronkowski, never far from the spotlight, first retired from the New England Patriots in March 2019, only to be lured back by Brady for a Tampa Bay reunion. Their partnership delivered fourth Super Bowl win before Gronkowski announced his second retirement in June 2022. But was his heart truly at rest? Perhaps not, since he rewrote his retirement script. On November 12, Rob Gronkowski signed a ceremonial one-day contract with New England at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, so he could officially retire as a Patriot after 11 total NFL seasons. Witnessing this emotional homecoming, his longtime partner and SI Swimsuit star Camille Kostek celebrated on Instagram , sharing 11 photos, one supposedly for each season, and declaring him a “Patriot for life.”The first snapshot was taken inside Gillette Stadium, likely from the Patriots' office. The NFL couple stood in business casuals before a backdrop of Gronkowski’s moments as a Patriots player. Camille Kostek wore a dark denim blue co-ord set with a denim shirt and matching wide-legged trousers. Her medium-length wavy blond hair was left down. She wore glossy peach lipstick, blush, and prominent kohl on the corners of her eyes, along with big, round gold earrings.Gronkowski wore a navy-blue suit with a white collared shirt and brown and white shoes. He had a thin goatee and a spiked army cut.The next snapshot showed them with Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who appeared to be signing his one-day contract. Another image showed the Gillette Stadium Jumbotron displaying a big message: “THANK YOU GRONK,” with Patriots’ Super Bowl championship banners above, commemorating six victories. Other images included the four-time Super Bowl champion in an interview or photoshoot, the stadium in its raw form, and Gronkowski chatting with current head coach Mike Vrabel. The coach and the tight end never played together, as Gronkowski was drafted a year before Vrabel was traded. Vrabel played linebacker for the Patriots from 2001 to 2008. The last image is the cutest, featuring the couple’s French bulldog, Ralphie Gronkowski, whom Rob and Camille adopted in February 2021. Ralphie lies comfortably on a sofa, wearing a Patriots jersey.","Gronkowski first retired from the New England Patriots in March 2019, only to be lured back by Tom Brady for a Tampa Bay reunion.

More coverage on NHL:

The Columbus Blue Jackets were left searching for answers after captain Boone Jenner exited Tuesday’s game against the Seattle Kraken with an upper body injury. The veteran center left early in the second period, immediately raising concerns for a team that relies heavily on his leadership and dependable two way presence.Jenner had been performing well to start the season, providing steady production and anchoring the top six. His early exit disrupted the team’s rhythm and created uncertainty about his availability for the upcoming stretch of games.On Thursday, head coach Dean Evason finally addressed the situation and shared the clarity the team needed. He revealed that Jenner’s injury is not a short-term issue, indicating that the Blue Jackets will likely be without their captain for a longer period than hoped. The update delivered a tough blow to a roster already searching for consistency.Jenner, age 32, recorded three goals and seven assists through 16 games before the setback. His value goes beyond scoring, as he regularly handles key faceoffs, heavy minutes, and leadership responsibilities. Unfortunately, injuries have been a recurring part of his recent seasons. He has not appeared in 70 games since the 2019 to 2020 campaign and played only 56 games last year.This new absence adds to that pattern at a difficult point in the schedule.Columbus will likely be without Jenner when they face the Edmonton Oilers on Thursday night. The team also hosts the New York Rangers on Saturday and the Montreal Canadiens on Monday, creating a challenging stretch without their most experienced forward. His absence will influence special teams, physical play, and overall lineup stability.There is some good news with the return of Kent Johnson, who missed the Kraken game. Johnson has five points in 15 appearances and will help strengthen the center position, though replacing Jenner’s complete impact remains a significant task. As the Blue Jackets move through this crucial part of the season, Jenner’s recovery timeline becomes a major storyline to monitor. The team will rely heavily on depth and adaptability as they wait for their captain to heal.","The Columbus Blue Jackets were left searching for answers after captain Boone Jenner exited Tuesday’s game against the Seattle Kraken with an upper body injury.

Availability for Tonight’s Pelicans Matchup

Rehab Progress and What Comes Next

The Los Angeles Lakers will once again be without LeBron James as they prepare to face the New Orleans Pelicans on November 14, 2025. The superstar has been officially ruled out due to persistent right sciatica, an issue that has plagued him since before the start of the 2025–26 season. Despite taking encouraging steps in his rehabilitation program and participating in extensive practice sessions, the Lakers are not ready to clear him for gameplay.LeBron James’ ongoing recovery has included multiple workouts with the Lakers’ G League affiliate, the South Bay Lakers, where he has taken part in full-contact 5-on-5 drills. Although these sessions have produced promising signs - with no reported discomfort or post-practice setbacks - the organization continues to prioritize caution, keeping him sidelined until he reaches full readiness for NBA action.LeBronLeBron has been out since the beginning of the season after dealing with right sciatica, a nerve-related condition causing intense pain in the lower back and radiating down his right side. This condition prevented him from joining training camp and has already kept him from the Lakers’ first 13 regular-season games. While working with the South Bay Lakers, he has steadily increased the intensity of his sessions and has reportedly handled full-contact scrimmages well.Still, team medical staff and coaches believe he needs additional time before he returns to the main roster.For tonight’s Lakers vs. Pelicans game, the organization has officially listed LeBron James as out. The decision reflects the team’s commitment to long-term health management, especially with sciatica being the type of injury that can flare up under heavy physical strain. The Lakers will also be missing several key contributors, including Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura, and Jordan Goodwin, all ruled out for the matchup. Meanwhile, Adou Thiero remains questionable, leaving the roster in a challenging position as they face a competitive Pelicans squad.Although LeBron James is unavailable tonight, the trajectory of his rehabilitation remains positive. His participation in multiple high-intensity G League practices without complications indicates meaningful progress. The Lakers are optimistic that he could rejoin the team after their upcoming road trip, depending on how he responds to continued conditioning. For LeBron James, the priority is ensuring he returns at a level where he can perform at his standard of excellence, particularly as he aims to compete in what could be a historic 23rd NBA season.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers vs New Orleans Pelicans regular season game: Full injury report, who;s out, and more (November 14, 2025) For Lakers fans, patience remains essential.

Can Edmonton Oilers actually convince the Nashville Predators to trade Juuse Saros?

“Absolutely Dynamic”: 55 Minutes of Juuse Saros Saves

At the beginning of their season, the goaltending dilemma at the Edmonton Oilers turned out to be their most important story, particularly after the humiliating 9-1 loss to the Colorado Avalanche. That loss led fans and analysts to push for GM Stan Bowman to take action immediately, and now he is under a lot of pressure to consider upgrading the goaltender position. Stuart Skinner has managed to perform better recently, and so he has received some support, but the conversation concerning if Juuse Saros could be the long-term answer still reigns in the league discussions.Interest in Saros rose when Jeff Marek first floated his name as a possible target, then insiders like Allan Mitchell and Mark Spector followed up with more detailed analyses. The biggest problem is clear: Edmonton is very close to the salary cap limit, has almost no tradable players, and Saros has only just begun the first year of an eight-year contract that carries a full no-movement clause. This situation makes any trade incredibly difficult, despite the fact that most people think that Saros would quickly bring stability to the Oilers’ most vulnerable area.The first question is whether Nashville wants to discuss things.Until now, the insider's view of the situation is that the Predators are not interested in trading Juuse Saros. Allan Mitchell mentioned that any trade would see the Nashville team retaining some salary, and allowing it to take back several players, whereas, in the case of Skinner, Frank Seravalli was not sure if Saros’ recent performance could be considered an upgrade over Skinner.The Pittsburgh Penguins, meanwhile, are figuring out how their narrative is changing. Insiders, like Josh Yohe, are saying that after the team’s surprisingly good start, players like Erik Karlsson, Rickard Rakell, and Bryan Rust are no longer going to be trade candidates — at least not as long as the team stays in the playoffs. GM Kyle Dubas will not be chasing risky rentals or sacrificing future assets, which implies he is adopting a more conservative approach compared to the previous seasons.The Oilers can only have Juuse Saros in their dreams for the moment, as all indications are that this trade is unlikely to happen — at least for now. Nashville wants to keep its goalie, and Edmonton has no room under the cap, making it more probable that the latter's next step will be aiming at a backup strengthening rather than going for a spectacular blockbuster trade.More coverage on NHL","Edmonton Oilers GM Stan Bowman is under a lot of pressure to consider upgrading the goaltender position.

Blake Coleman emerges as a trade target amidst potential NHL suitors

This is WILD… Insider LINKS Coleman to Devils | Calgary Flames News

As the Calgary Flames navigate a slow start to the 2025-26 season, trade chatter has begun to swirl loudly. As names like Rasmus Andersson and Nazem Kadri have dominated speculation, insiders now say the player drawing the most attention is another veteran forward, Blake Coleman. Despite the rising demand for Kadri and Andersson, Flames forward Blake Coleman is drawing the most early interest.The reason behind this trade chatter is due to his contract and reliable play, which is making him attractive to potential suitors. Coleman, who is in the fourth season of his six-year, $29.4 million contract. Meanwhile, multiple teams have contacted Calgary expressing strong interest in the 33-year-old winger, according to recent reports.As trade speculation is picking up momentum, Calgary Flames forward Blake Coleman has emerged as a top trade target amidst potential NHL suitors. He has become the focal point of interest among multiple NHL contenders as he is considered one of the most dependable two-way forwards, offering a strong penalty-killing presence, leadership experience, and reliable secondary scoring.According to Pierre LeBrun of The Athletic, Coleman is getting the most attention now.""Interestingly, for all the speculation around Andersson and Kadri, ... the player who’s received the most attention from other teams is Blake Coleman,"" LeBrun wrote. ""Teams are ... letting Flames GM Craig Conroy know that if he entertains moving Coleman, get in touch... In no way is Calgary shopping Coleman. But Conroy can’t control teams reaching out. "" (source: Sportskeeda)The primary reason behind this attention is based on Coleman’s experience and contract. As per reports, he is signed through 2026-27 with a $4.9 million salary, on a 6-year with $29,400,000. Coleman is known for strong two-way play and has won two Stanley Cups with Tampa Bay. So, many contending teams value his leadership and playoff play.As per his NHL stats and career, Coleman has eight points in 19 games this season, including seven goals and one assist so far. Moreover, the veteran player has earned 298 points in 643 career games. He remains one of Calgary’s most reliable forwards every night and holds value as an offensive addition for any team.Calgary must now decide whether to keep its veteran forwards or trade them. The organization is therefore expected to monitor how the season unfolds leading up to March, with their overall trajectory ultimately shaping every trade decision.","Calgary Flames forward Blake Coleman has emerged as a top trade target amidst potential NHL suitors.

Lions Get Aidan Hutchinson back but secondary issues deepen before Eagles clash



Lions’ Aidan Hutchinson Details Recovery From Season-Ending Injury + Regrets Not Meeting Eminem 😱

More coverage in NFL:

The Detroit Lions enter Week 11 with a mix of optimism and growing anxiety as they prepare for a nationally televised clash with the Philadelphia Eagles. While the return of star pass rusher Aidan Hutchinson boosts Detroit’s confidence, a wave of secondary injuries is threatening to unravel the team’s defensive stability at the worst possible time.This matchup carries major playoff implications, and the Lions know that limiting Jalen Hurts and Philadelphia’s explosive receiving duo is critical. Hutchinson’s availability helps, but the mounting issues in the defensive backfield are the main concern this week and could play a major role in how Sunday night unfolds.Aidan Hutchinson’s full return to practice on Thursday delivered the good news Detroit desperately needed. After sitting out Wednesday with an elbow issue, the star edge rusher was cleared to resume full work, signaling his readiness for Week 11. Hutchinson has been one of the driving forces behind Detroit’s top-tier pressure numbers, and his presence is essential to containing Hurts’ mobility and disrupting Philadelphia’s rhythm.However, the Lions’ secondary is moving in the opposite direction. Cornerback Amik Robertson was added to the injury report with a hamstring problem, creating another major concern.Robertson has frequently served as Detroit’s No. 1 corner due to injuries elsewhere, making his status crucial for a defense preparing to face AJ Brown and DeVonta Smith.Veteran corner DJ Reed, sidelined since Week 4 with a hamstring strain, practiced in a limited capacity for the second straight day, but the team has yet to decide whether to activate him for Sunday. Rookie Terrion Arnold remains in concussion protocol and hasn’t practiced all week, while safety Kerby Joseph is expected to miss his fourth straight game with a knee issue. If Robertson is unavailable and Reed isn’t cleared, Detroit may be forced to rely on Rock Ya-Sin and Nick Whiteside against one of the NFL’s toughest passing attacks.Offensively, tight end Sam LaPorta missed his second consecutive practice with a back injury, creating uncertainty around one of Jared Goff’s most reliable weapons. The Lions also saw defensive tackle Pat O’Connor downgraded to a non-participant, while Taylor Decker, Penei Sewell, Marcus Davenport, Josh Paschal, Sione Vaki, and Brock Wright were limited. Malcolm Rodriguez and Graham Glasgow practiced fully, offering at least some stability heading into Sunday. With so many moving pieces, the Lions’ depth and resilience will be tested as they aim to hold their ground in a crucial Week 11 showdown.",Detroit Lions face Philadelphia Eagles in nationally televised game on Sunday.

That’s where I fell in love with hockey, in the same arenas these kids skate in now. To be able to give back with NHLPA Goals & Dreams and NHL Street Hockey to help more kids experience that same feeling, that same opportunity, means a lot.

NHL Trade Rumor: Rasmus Andersson linked to Maple Leafs as Calgary Flames explore options,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumor-rasmus-andersson-linked-to-maple-leafs-as-calgary-flames-explore-options/articleshow/125335267.cms,"Rasmus Andersson (Image Via Twitter)

Are Maple Leafs making a mistake by chasing Rasmus Andersson amid ongoing defensive struggles?

Leafs Readying For Life Without Matthews | Real Kyper & Bourne

Once again, the trade talks surrounding Rasmus Andersson have come up with the Calgary Flames having a hard time at the beginning of the season. Andersson, who is now in the last year of his six-year contract, has a cap hit of $4.55 million that is still reasonable and has a modified six-team no-trade clause, thus making him one of the most fascinating players to be mentioned in the trade rumors. His contract runs out in 2026, but the unclear situation concerning the Flames' future has put the talks about his future into overdrive.Across the border in Toronto, the Maple Leafs’ inconsistent start of 8-8-2 has created a situation where more urgency than optimism prevails. Their attack is still maintaining a high rate of scoring of 3.61 goals per game, but conceding 3.83 goals has laid bare the same defensive shortcomings that have troubled the team for a number of years. Besides, the injuries of key players such as Auston Matthews and Anthony Stolarz, and the fact that the special teams are among the worst in the league, have made it really hard to ignore the defensive problems of the Leafs. As a result, all attention was turned to Andersson, who has been a good, top-four defender able to take the toll of 24+ minutes of ice time at night.Analyst Sam McKee on Sportsnet 590 The FAN warned the Maple Leafs about being overly optimistic in their Rasmus Andersson pursuit.The trade of major assets for a player who might become a UFA in 2026 is a gamble, considering that Toronto has limited prospects and draft picks. Also, McKee doubted whether the Leafs’ current situation — inconsistent defense, a power play ranked 24th, and a penalty kill ranked 19th — justifies a forceful move. However, with Calgary postponing Andersson’s extension negotiations, the speculation is increasing. Despite that, McKee suggests that the Leafs should not be hasty with such an expensive choice.Rasmus Andersson may be the right player, but this may be the wrong time. With the Leafs’ assets already stretched thin and their performance unreliable, patience—not panic—might be the smarter long-term move.More coverage on NHL","Rasmus Andersson is in the last year of his six-year contract with the Calgary Flames.

Theenter their November 14, 2025 regular-season matchup with significant roster complications on both sides. What was initially projected to be a star-powered showdown has quickly transformed into a depth-driven contest shaped by injury-induced adjustments and strategic reshuffling. With several key names unavailable or uncertain, both teams are navigating a delicate balance between maintaining competitiveness and protecting their long-term health goals.The stakes remain high regardless of the setbacks. The Lakers are aiming to stabilize their early-season rhythm without multiple veteran leaders, while the Pelicans look to stay afloat in the standings despite long-term absences to core players. These circumstances position the clash at Smoothie King Center as a test of grit, adaptability, and coaching flexibility.Los Angeles Lakers enters the matchup with a lengthy list of unavailable contributors. LeBron James is ruled out due to right sciatica, a major loss given his playmaking, leadership, and ability to elevate the team in high-pressure stretches. Young wing Adou Thiero is listed as questionable with a left knee injury that may require surgery, leaving his status uncertain.The guard rotation takes a further hit as Gabe Vincent remains sidelined with a left ankle sprain.Taurean Prince continues to recover from a neck herniated disc, reducing forward depth and versatility. Kevin Porter Jr. is unavailable as he recovers from right knee meniscus surgery, and Jordan Poole is out with a left quad strain, removing a major scoring option. With so many players missing, the Lakers are leaning heavily on Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura to carry offensive and defensive responsibility, though the absence of James and Poole will be significant.The New Orleans Pelicans are facing their own critical setbacks. Zion Williamson is still out with a left hamstring strain, though reports note progress in rehab and clearance for non-contact on-court work. Dejounte Murray remains sidelined with a right Achilles rupture, eliminating a major defensive presence and backcourt playmaker. Two-way guard Trey Alexander is out, and several developmental and G League players - along with Gabe Vincent following recent roster movements - remain unavailable.Day’Ron Sharpe is questionable with a left glute contusion, adding to frontcourt concerns. In response, New Orleans relies heavily on Luka Dončić’s elite scoring and facilitating, supported by Trey Murphy III, DeAndre Ayton, and Jake LaRavia, who have stepped up to maintain competitive balance despite the injuries.The extensive injury situations on both sides shift the emphasis toward depth production, defensive execution, and in-game adjustments. The Los Angeles Lakers must find ways to compensate for missing star power and perimeter scoring, while the New Orleans Pelicans aim to build around the reliable output of Dončić and supporting talent. Fans can expect a physical, tactical, and closely contested battle defined by resilience rather than marquee names.","The Los Angeles Lakers host the New Orleans Pelicans in a November 14, 2025 regular-season matchup.

What the Sixers Will Rely on Tonight

Fan Reactions and Game Expectations

Joel Embiid has officially been ruled out for tonight’s matchup against the Detroit Pistons, as the Philadelphia 76ers continue to manage his right knee soreness. The Sixers’ latest injury report for November 14, 2025, confirms that the reigning MVP will not suit up, extending a stretch of careful monitoring following his ongoing knee issues. This decision aligns with the team’s long-term approach, particularly as they remain engaged in NBA Cup Group Play.This marks the second straight game Embiid will miss after sitting out against the Boston Celtics. Philadelphia has avoided playing him on consecutive nights this season, prioritizing his recovery and ensuring that minor flare-ups do not escalate. While the news may disappoint fans hoping to see him dominate in the paint, the team has emphasized that Embiid has fortunately avoided any structural damage, and his day-to-day status indicates optimism moving forward.The organization maintains a cautious stance but remains encouraged by Joel Embiid’s progress. Despite knee soreness lingering over recent games, medical evaluations have reportedly shown no major concerns. His status as day-to-day suggests that his absence is more about precaution than setback. This approach reflects Philadelphia’s larger goal of keeping their franchise cornerstone healthy for the long haul rather than pushing him into November games at the expense of durability.Joel Embiid’s last outing - a standout 29-point performance in a win over the Toronto Raptors - showcased the level of impact they lose without him. His scoring, defensive presence, and leadership continue to anchor the Sixers’ identity. With him sidelined, the coaching staff must lean on adjustments that boost energy, creativity, and next-man-up effort.Tyrese Maxey instantly becomes the focal point of the offense, and recent history suggests he’s up for the task. Maxey has averaged over 30 points and close to seven assists in his last four games against Detroit, making him Philadelphia’s clearest path to staying competitive. The team will also be without Paul George, who continues to recover from left knee surgery, adding to the pressure on the backcourt.Center depth becomes critical with Joel Embiid unavailable. Veterans Andre Drummond and rookie Adem Bona are expected to handle the interior responsibilities, bringing contrasting styles that could give the Sixers a dynamic but unpredictable presence in the paint. Rookie VJ Edgecombe remains questionable with back spasms, further thinning the rotation.Supporters have largely backed the decision to rest Joel Embiid, joking online about “load management and living-room leadership,” while also recognizing the importance of preserving their superstar. Tonight offers Maxey another chance to strengthen his emerging star power as Philadelphia seeks to remain competitive despite missing key contributors.","Joel Embiid has been ruled out for tonight’s matchup against the Detroit Pistons.

More coverage in NFL:

Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert is used to commanding national attention, but Week 11 brings a rare twist that puts his own family in the spotlight. His younger brother, Patrick Herbert, is on the verge of making his NFL regular-season debut, setting the stage for an unexpected storyline that has quickly gained momentum ahead of Sunday’s matchup.For the Jacksonville Jaguars, the timing couldn’t be more compelling. Injuries at the tight end position have created a real opening for Patrick, who has quietly spent the season developing on the practice squad. Now, as the Jaguars prepare to face the Chargers, the possibility of a Herbert-versus-Herbert moment has become one of Week 11’s most intriguing developments.Patrick Herbert, like his older brother, came through the Oregon program and earned a shot in Jacksonville with the hope of carving out his own NFL path. Though he has yet to take an official snap in a regular-season game, circumstances this week may finally give him that chance. The Jaguars are dealing with injuries to Brenton Strange and Hunter Long, thinning the depth at tight end and increasing the likelihood of elevating Patrick to the gameday roster.Despite Johnny Mundt and Quintin Morris sitting ahead of him on the depth chart, the coaching staff may opt to bring Patrick up for added depth and flexibility.For Patrick, sharing an NFL field with Justin would not only be historic—it would mark a personal milestone after months of hard work on the practice squad.Patrick spoke earlier this week about how meaningful this moment could be, acknowledging that watching Justin succeed over the last several years has been both inspiring and grounding. Facing his brother on an NFL stage is something the family dreamed about, but few expected it to materialize this soon.If the Jaguars elevate Patrick, Week 11 instantly becomes more than just another AFC showdown. It becomes a rare family narrative, one that brings together two brothers chasing the same dream on opposite sidelines. And for Patrick Herbert, this could be the moment that officially launches his NFL journey, turning a long-awaited opportunity into a memorable debut.","Patrick Herbert will make his NFL debut in Week 11, facing brother Justin.

On the latest episode of the “Show Me Something” podcast, she reacted to a viral moment where a fan proposed at an Ole Miss game. Cunningham made it clear she wants no part of such grand public gestures.“I swear, if anyone were to ever propose to me at any sporting event, I would punch them in the nose and I would leave. I think it’s gross. There’s no way in hell. If someone were to ever do that to me, actually, they wouldn’t do that because I wouldn’t be getting proposed to, cause they would know I would not want that”, Cunningham said.Cunningham has kept her romantic life private. Earlier this year, she revealed she was single and not dating anyone. Her honesty about her life and performances makes her a fan favourite.

'Control your temptations': Jasprit Bumrah reacts after stunning fifer against South Africa in 1st Test

Poll Should South Africa have escalated the stump-mic incident? Yes No

South Africa have taken a measured stance on the stump-mic moment that briefly overshadowed the opening day of the first Test at Eden Gardens, with batting coach Ashwell Prince confirming the visitors will not escalate the matter.The incident unfolded during the 13th over of South Africa’s innings, moments after Jasprit Bumrah struck Temba Bavuma on the pads with a delivery that cut back into the right-hander.India’s appeal was turned down, leading to a discussion between Bumrah and wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant over the DRS call. The stump mic picked up a remark, which was widely interpreted online as “bauna bhi hai”, which triggered debate on social media.Prince, however, dismissed the prospect of internal discussion or formal action.“No, there will be no discussion. It's the first time, obviously, it's come to my attention. I don't think there'll be any issues with what's happened out in the middle,” he said.Bavuma, returning after a calf strain, lasted 11 balls before Kuldeep Yadav removed him with a leg-slip trap. His early exit came during a phase in which India clawed back control after South Africa’s steady start at 62/2.Bumrah’s spell, meanwhile, continued to dictate the course of the day.The fast bowler claimed 5/27, striking early blows by removing Aiden Markram and Ryan Rickelton before triggering a collapse that sent South Africa tumbling to 159 all out. His ability to generate movement on a dry surface that offered inconsistent bounce stood out even in a bowling attack built around four spinners.The visitors had entered the series after a mixed run last season, one that included both strong home performances and stretches of inconsistency away from familiar conditions. Their World Test Championship defence began with injuries disrupting the squad, and Bavuma’s delayed return added to the adjustments made for the Kolkata Test.While the stump-mic remark dominated online chatter after play, South Africa’s camp has shifted focus back to the cricket, emphasising that their assessment remains confined to on-field events. India closed the day at 37/1, leaving the match finely poised heading into Day 2.With no complaint expected and both sides turning their attention to the remainder of the Test, the controversy is unlikely to stretch beyond its brief viral moment","Jasprit Bumrah was involved in a controversial moment as his words, which were likely aimed at Temba Bavuma, were picked up on the stump mic.
