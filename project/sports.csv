NEW DELHI: Tejashwi Yadav ’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Bihar assembly's single-largest party and the main opposition force, marked Diwali on Monday by announcing its list of 143 candidates. The move asserts RJD’s dominant position within the Mahagathbandhan even as tensions simmer among allies.Led by Tejashwi, the party aims to unseat chief minister Nitish Kumar , who has anti-incumbency as a negative factor after years in power. For RJD, long led by Lalu Prasad Yadav, this election is crucial, a battle that could define Tejashwi’s political future.The announcement came on the last day of nominations for the second phase, confirming that RJD will contest 143 seats, Congress 61, CPI(ML) 20, and the remaining few likely going to Mukesh Sahani’s VIP.RJD scion Tejashwi will contest again from Raghopur, while several key names feature in the list, including Renu Kushwaha from Bihariganj, Anita Devi Mahto from Warsaliganj, and Mala Pushpam from Hasanpur. Other candidates include Sandhya Rani Kushwaha from Madhuban, Ritu Priya Chaudhary from Imamganj (SC), Tanushree Manjhi from Barachatti (SC), and Chandni Devi Singh from Baniapur.In a sign of strain within the alliance, RJD and Congress have fielded rival candidates in several constituencies.In Narkatiaganj, Deepak Yadav (RJD) faces Shaswat Kedar Pandey (Congress); in Kahalgaon, Rajnish Bharti (RJD) goes up against Praveen Singh Kushwaha (Congress); and in Sikandra (SC), Uday Narayan Chaudhary (RJD) faces Vinod Chaudhary (Congress).Another constituent of the alliance, CPI too faces Congress in Bachhwara, Rajapakar, Rosera, and Biharsharif, while RJD is directly up against Congress in Vaishali, Warisaliganj, Lalganj, and Kahalgaon.RJD’s list clearly reflects its focus on the traditional Muslim-Yadav (MY) equation, with over 50 tickets allotted to these communities. Of the total 143 candidates, 23 are women, marking an effort to broaden the party’s appeal.The party also handed a ticket to the late gangster-politician and former RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddin’s son from Siwan’s Raghunathpur, reinforcing ties to its old base.A key highlight is the battle for Mahua, where RJD’s Mukesh Raushan will face Tej Pratap Yadav, Lalu’s elder son, who was expelled from the party earlier this year. Tej Pratap has since launched his own party, Janshakti Janata Dal, and announced himself as candidate from Mahua, an RJD stronghold. The family feud adds personal drama to the already tense political equation.Several incumbents and loyalists have retained their seats. A Yadav continues from Sonepur in Saran district, Lalu’s home turf, while Bhai Virendra from Maner and Ritlal Rai from Danapur also feature on the list. Both seats fall within the Pataliputra Lok Sabha constituency, represented by Misa Bharti, Lalu’s daughter, in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Despite releasing its list, the Mahagathbandhan has yet to formally announce a chief ministerial candidate. While Tejashwi’s leadership is widely recognised, Rahul Gandhi’s avoidance of naming him as the CM face at a joint rally has fuelled speculation of unease within the alliance.The overlapping seats and leadership ambiguity could end up benefiting the ruling NDA.Bihar, India’s fourth-largest assembly, will go to polls in two phases -- November 6 and November 11 -- with counting on November 14.","Tejashwi Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal announces its list of 143 candidates.

NDA’s balancing act: Can Nitish Kumar and Chirag Paswan coexist?

‘Jungle Raj’: Amit Shah Slams RJD For Fielding Shahabuddin's Son In Bihar Elections

2020 fallout: When Chirag went solo





Nitish’s declining arc





What's at stake?





NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing deal for the upcoming 2025 Bihar assembly election revealed a subtle but significant shift in internal power dynamics within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). For the first time since the early 1990s, the two principal partners — the Janata Dal (United) (JD(U)), led by chief minister Nitish Kumar , and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — will contest 101 seats each in Bihar’s 243-seat assembly, while the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) (LJP(RV)), led by Chirag Paswan, got 29 seats.For the first time, the BJP has secured equal seat-sharing in Bihar, ending the long-standing tradition of Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) playing the “big brother.” This parity between BJP and JD(U) underscores how BJP has shifted from the “junior” to an equal (or perhaps dominant) status in Bihar’s ruling coalition — while continuing to present Nitish as the face of stability.Meanwhile, LJP(RV)’s allocation of 29 seats — though modest in absolute terms — is significantly larger than typical junior-ally shares and includes visibility-rich constituencies: for example, in districts such as Jamui, Hajipur and Khagaria, where Dalit and youth demographics are strong.The logic seems clear: BJP is hedging its bet—maintaining Nitish for his experience and stability, while elevating Chirag as a long-term ally and potentially a future power centre.The backdrop to this shifting balance lies in the 2020 assembly election. In that election, JD(U) won just 43 seats, down from 71 in 2015 elections. Meanwhile, LJP fielded candidates on its own and acted as a vote-splitter. The result of this vote-cutting was a massive drop in the JD(U)'s seat tally, which fell from 71 seats in 2015 to just 43 seats in 2020.This was the JD(U)'s lowest tally in years and resulted in the party becoming the junior partner to the BJP for the first time in the NDA coalition in Bihar.As Chirag famously declared in October 2020, “I am Prime Minister Modi’s Hanuman… the PM lives in my heart.” His solo campaign was widely seen as an effort to weaken JD(U) while maintaining warmth toward the BJP.Nitish, for his part, responded with restraint. He welcomed the NDA’s overall victory but could not overlook how his party’s reduced tally had shifted the internal arithmetic — paving the way for BJP’s greater influence in coalition decisions.Nitish Kumar’s political journey has been defined by his reputation as “Sushasan Babu” — the administrator who once dominated Bihar’s politics. But by 2020, JD(U)’s footprint had shrunk and its strike rate fell sharply.Now, in 2025, BJP appears to be pursuing a dual strategy: keep Nitish visible as the stabiliser and face of continuity, while also nurturing Chirag as a parallel power centre. For BJP, that solves two problems at once: one, it retains the organisational strength and governance credentials associated with Nitish; two, it prepares for a future in which the LJP’s Dalit-youth base and rising profile may become more central.For Nitish, the 2025 election is not just about retaining power—it’s about preserving relevance. If JD(U) fails to hold ground, Nitish may become a symbolic leader within his own alliance rather than its fulcrum.For Chirag, the 29-seat allocation marks his political breakthrough. He revealed that his party chose from a “pool of 38 seats” offered by BJP, stressing “quality over quantity.” His negotiation skills were on full display during the seat-sharing talks: engaging in multiple rounds with senior BJP and JD(U) leaders, he held firm until securing favourable terms. As a result, LJP(RV) emerged as the largest junior ally in the NDA. While BJP and JD(U) settled for 101 seats each, smaller allies — Jitan Ram Manjhi’s HAM and Upendra Kushwaha’s RLM — received only six seats apiece.This distribution positions Chirag as a key player in post-poll arithmetic, regardless of how the NDA performs overall.As for the BJP is concerned, the party seems to trying to thread the needle between coalition harmony and long-term dominance. If Nitish remains on board, BJP retains stability; if Chirag’s LJP strengthens, BJP gains leverage and a younger, more dynamic ally with reach into new caste and regional segments.Whether this triangular arrangement can sustain itself through the campaign — and beyond — will test the NDA’s cohesion like never before. Whether Nitish and Chirag truly coexist within the same alliance without their ambitions colliding remains to be seen.","BJP and JD(U) will contest 101 seats each in Bihar’s 243-seat assembly. Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) (LJP(RV), led by Chirag Paswan, got 29 seats.

Bihar Polls: UP CM Yogi Adityanath Accuses RJD, Congress of ‘Mischief’ Over Burqa Verification Order

NEW DLEHI: Janhit Janata Dal (JJD) chief and Lalu Yadav ’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav , who is set to contest from Mahua constituency in the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections , filed his nomination on Thursday accompanied by a roadshow and carrying a photo of his grandmother Marchiya Devi.Speaking to reporters, he said the occasion was significant for him as he had moved ahead with the blessings of his grandmother and parents.""I have moved ahead with the blessings of my grandmother and my parents. On this auspicious occasion, as I am required to file my nomination, I have brought my grandmother with me. She lives on in our hearts... People of Mahua will support whoever works for them. I worked to make Mahua a district and also give employment opportunities to the youth,"" Tej Pratap said, as quoted by ANI.Tej Pratap, who currently represents Hasanpur, had earlier served as Mahua MLA from 2015 to 2020. The seat is now held by RJD’s Mukesh Kumar Raushan.The JJD, which Tej Pratap floated after his expulsion from the RJD earlier this year, has announced 22 candidates in its first list for the assembly elections scheduled for November. His expulsion from the party followed a controversy involving a social media post where he claimed to be in a long-term relationship.Tej Pratap had later stated that his account was hacked.His strained ties with his family have played out publicly in recent months. On October 12, he unfollowed his younger brother and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on X. He had earlier unfollowed his sisters Misa Bharti and Hema Yadav. He now follows only five accounts, including his father Lalu Prasad Yadav, mother Rabri Devi, and sister Raj Lakshmi Yadav.Despite family tensions, Tej Pratap’s sister Rohini Acharya extended her support to him with a message on X: ""May you achieve all the success and happiness in the world, and may you always move forward like a shining light, brother. Wishing you all the very best... with love and blessings.""It makes an interesting twist in the Yadav family dynamics, as last month Rohini Acharya did something similar to his elder brother Tej Pratap when she unfollowed RJD, and Tejaswi Yadav from her social media accounts. The increasing rifts between family members playing out in public are often attributed to sudden importance given to Sanjay Yadav, a close friend to Tejaswi.On being asked about the grandmother and Acharya he said, ""I brought the photo of my grandmother Marchiya Devi in the nomination. With her blessing, I am going to win in Mahua. The Janshakti Janata Dal is going to win. Rohini Acharya called me, she extended her good wishes.""The Bihar Assembly elections will take place in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with counting scheduled for November 14. The main contest is expected between the NDA alliance led by BJP-JD(U) and the INDIA bloc led by RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav.

Why a Reunion Makes Sense

Themay be looking toward a major reunion this offseason, as reports suggest the team could make a push to bring back former MVP and World Series champion. After a roller-coaster regular season and an unexpected postseason surge, the Dodgers’ front office could be planning a familiar move to bolster their lineup once again.Following a strong postseason showing and an inspiring 10-game winning streak before falling to the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS, the Los Angeles Dodgers proved they still have the potential to compete at the highest level. Manager Dave Roberts’ fiery comments after sweeping the Milwaukee Brewers captured the team’s mindset.“Before this season started, they said the Dodgers are ruining baseball. Let’s get four more wins and really ruin baseball,” Roberts said on the air. (H/t: Sporting News)While Los Angeles is still focused on chasing championships, the offseason could bring a strategic reunion that excites fans - one involving a two-time All-Star and one of the most popular Dodgers of recent years.Cody Bellinger, who won the 2019 NL MVP with the Los Angeles Dodgers, saw a drastic dip in performance over the next three seasons. During that time, he hit just .203/.272/.376 with a 76 OPS+ across 1,143 plate appearances, which ultimately led to the Dodgers non-tendering him.However, since leaving Los Angeles, Bellinger has rediscovered his form. Over the past three seasons, he’s posted a 125 OPS+ and accumulated 12.0 WAR in 412 games, proving that his prime years may not be over yet.According to Bleacher Report’s Joel Reuter, “After winning NL MVP in 2019, Cody Bellinger hit a combined .203/.272/.376 for a 76 OPS+ over 1,143 plate appearances in the three years that followed, which ultimately led to him being non-tendered. In three years since he left, he has a 125 OPS+ and 12.0 WAR in 412 games, and he could be atop the Los Angeles Dodgers list of potential targets to replace Michael Conforto as a left-handed hitting outfielder. ”Bellinger is expected to opt out of his current deal with the New York Yankees, where he recently experienced a resurgence. ESPN’s Jorge Castillo reported that “As expected, New York Yankees outfielder Cody Bellinger plans to opt out of his contract and become a free agent next month, a source told ESPN. Bellinger, 30, has a $25 million player option for next season. After a rebound season in his first year in pinstripes, he presumably will receive widespread interest in free agency - it should yield a lucrative multi-year contract. ”This move could set the stage for a fierce bidding war between top contenders, including the Los Angeles Dodgers, who have the financial strength to compete for big-name free agents.Bellinger’s defensive versatility adds further appeal. He’s capable of playing center field, first base, and right field at a high level - traits that fit seamlessly into Dave Roberts’ flexible lineup approach. For the Dodgers, reuniting with Cody Bellinger wouldn’t just be about nostalgia; it would be a calculated move to strengthen both offense and defense.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Boston Red Sox could sign $180 million Houston Astros All-Star to replace Lucas Giolito as rotation upgrade The Los Angeles Dodgers have the money, the motivation, and the familiarity to make a reunion with Cody Bellinger a reality. As free agency approaches, all signs point toward a potential homecoming that could reignite memories of their 2020 World Series run - this time with Bellinger back in Dodger blue, aiming for redemption and another championship push.","Cody Bellinger won the 2019 NL MVP with the Los Angeles Dodgers.

The Atlanta Falcons have had an average start to the season as the team has managed to win in only three out of the six matches played so far in the new season.

As the team gears up to face the San Francisco 49ers, all eyes are on their star player, Michael Penix Jr.Yes, the Atlanta Falcons’ quarterback, Michael Penix Jr., is all set to play against the San Francisco 49ers tonight at the Levi’s Stadium.At this point in time, the Atlanta Falcons’ injury report does not feature Michael Penix Jr. on it.

Why the Trade Could Make Sense

Key Impacts of the Trade

What It Means for Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks

Thecould be on the verge of one of the biggest shake-ups in franchise history. With Jayson Tatum sidelined for most, if not all, of the 2025-26 NBA season due to a severe Achilles injury, the team might consider a bold move to keep their championship window alive - one that involves acquiring Milwaukee Bucks superstarTatum’s absence leaves a massive void, but Jaylen Brown is expected to carry the offensive load. Still, as reported by Fansided’s Matt Moore, Boston could benefit from thinking long-term by making a blockbuster trade with Milwaukee - one that would bring a generational player to TD Garden.According to Moore, the proposed trade would send Jaylen Brown, Anfernee Simons, Sam Hauser, Xavier Tillman, and two first-round picks to the Bucks. In return, the Boston Celtics would receive Giannis Antetokounmpo, Myles Turner, and Bobby Portis.Moore described the potential deal as painful but transformative for both sides. He wrote, “Obviously, Jaylen Brown is the best player in any of these packages that the Bucks can get back. A good-to-great player, in his prime, on a long-term contract. It would be painful for the Boston Celtics to make this trade… but Boston gets to instantly reorganize their future. It’s now Tatum coming back from the Achilles with Derrick White and Giannis.That’s your core for the next four years.” (H/t: Sporting News)The Boston Celtics’ current roster is talented, but losing Tatum for a long stretch threatens to stall their momentum. Adding Giannis Antetokounmpo, one of the league’s most dominant forwards, could immediately revitalize the team’s championship aspirations.Meanwhile, the Bucks would gain valuable depth and flexibility, particularly with Myles Turner anchoring their frontcourt and shifting their system from a wing-heavy to a more balanced inside-out structure.• For Boston: Forms a new core of Giannis, Tatum, and Derrick White, ensuring long-term competitiveness.• For Milwaukee: Gains multiple starting-caliber players and future assets to build around post-Giannis era.• For Giannis: Offers a fresh start with a championship-caliber franchise while pairing with a Top 15-20 player in Tatum once he returns. Giannis Antetokounmpo , who signed a massive $175 million contract, remains one of the NBA’s most valuable players. Yet, if Milwaukee’s postseason struggles continue, his patience could wear thin. A slow or uncompetitive start to the 2025-26 season might open the door for the Boston Celtics to swoop in.The 6-foot-11 forward has made it clear that he wants to maximize his prime years. If the Bucks fail to show signs of progress, a change of scenery might become inevitable. Boston’s combination of organizational stability and future star power could be exactly what he’s looking for.While the deal is purely hypothetical for now, it represents the kind of forward-thinking move that could redefine both franchises. Boston would get a generational talent ready to lead alongside Tatum once he’s healthy, while Milwaukee could reset with a deep, versatile roster.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Predicted to sign $186 million Milwaukee Bucks NBA All-Star to form deadly duo with Luka Doncic As the new season unfolds, all eyes will be on how Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks perform early.

Miami Dolphins make bold QB move: Quinn Ewers steps up as Tua Tagovailoa’s backup for Week 7 vs Browns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/miami-dolphins-make-bold-qb-move-quinn-ewers-steps-up-as-tua-tagovailoas-backup-for-week-7-vs-browns/articleshow/124692070.cms,"Quinn Ewers steps up as Dolphins’ QB backup (Image via: Getty images)

Quinn Ewers confirmed as Dolphins ’ backup to Tua Tagovailoa for Week 7

Zach Wilson moved to third-string as Dolphins adjust QB depth chart





The Miami Dolphins are making a bold quarterback move ahead of their Week 7 clash against the Cleveland Browns. Tua Tagovailoa remains the starter, but rookie Quinn Ewers will now serve as his backup, replacing Zach Wilson. Miami is preparing for a challenging game in Cleveland’s windy, wet conditions while testing their quarterback depth.According to NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport, Quinn Ewers will be active as the backup to Tua Tagovailoa for the Dolphins’ matchup against the Browns. Zach Wilson has been moved to the third-string role. This marks Ewers’ first time active in an NFL game, highlighting Miami’s confidence in the rookie’s ability to step up under pressure. The move also gives Ewers a chance to make his NFL debut in a potentially high-stakes environment.Ewers, who played his final season at Texas, threw for 3,472 passing yards with 31 touchdowns and 12 interceptions, leading the SEC in touchdown passes. In the Dolphins’ preseason, he went 23-of-43 for 273 yards and two touchdowns, taking four sacks but committing no turnovers. These performances signal that Ewers is ready to contribute when called upon.Miami’s $6 million offseason signing, Zach Wilson, is now the third-string quarterback. This season, Wilson completed 29-of-45 passes for 327 yards, one touchdown, and seven sacks, avoiding turnovers. The Dolphins’ decision to prioritize Ewers reflects their focus on building depth and evaluating rookie talent for long-term success. Wilson’s demotion highlights Miami’s growing trust in rookie quarterback Quinn Ewers, who continues to draw attention as one of the most promising young passers in the AFC.With Tua Tagovailoa starting and Ewers as the backup, Miami is prepared for any scenario in Cleveland. The windy and wet conditions could make the quarterback position crucial if a substitution is required. This move also gives Ewers a chance to make an early NFL impact and shows Miami’s strategic approach to managing their quarterback room.The Dolphins’ Week 7 quarterback change demonstrates the team’s commitment to preparing for adversity and developing rookie talent. Quinn Ewers’ elevation to backup marks a significant step in his NFL journey and could play a key role in Miami’s Week 7 game against the Browns. If Ewers sees game action, it could offer a glimpse into Miami’s future at quarterback — a storyline that could define their 2025 NFL campaign.Also Read: Could Dolphins’ Anthony Weaver jump ship after 2025 disaster?

How a social media rumor spiraled out of control

Super Bowl SHOCK: Turning Point USA Plots Its OWN Halftime Show Amid Bad Bunny Drama

Adam Sandler remains focused on comedy and film, not politics

A bizarre viral rumor suggesting that Adam Sandler was set to perform at Turning Point USA’s All-American Halftime Show has officially been debunked. The claim, which spread rapidly across Facebook and X (formerly Twitter), alleged that the comedian would headline a rival event to the Super Bowl halftime show, but fact-checkers and sources close to Sandler have confirmed that the story is entirely fabricated.The rumor began earlier this week after a series of misleading Facebook posts claimed that “Adam Sandler will join Lara Trump at the Turning Point USA halftime show.” The posts racked up thousands of shares within hours, with users debating whether Adam Sandler had shifted toward political performances. However, no reputable news outlet, nor Turning Point USA itself, ever announced his involvement.According to media watchdog Primetimer, the rumor stemmed from a manipulated headline that mixed genuine coverage of Lara Trump’s recent offer to perform at the event with false claims about Sandler’s participation. The viral graphic even used a photo of Sandler from his Netflix stand-up special, adding to the illusion of authenticity.Fact-checkers later confirmed that Sandler has no known ties to Turning Point USA or its founder Charlie Kirk, and he has never publicly expressed interest in performing at political events.In reality, Adam Sandler’s current schedule is packed with promotional appearances for his upcoming Netflix sequel “Happy Gilmore 2” and a new family comedy project set for release in 2026.Sources close to the actor emphasized that he’s steering clear of politically charged platforms. “He’s focused on creative projects and touring, not partisan events,” one insider told Primetimer.This isn’t the first time Sandler has been the subject of viral misinformation. Earlier this year, fake posts alleged that he had exchanged texts with Charlie Kirk and criticized late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, both of which were later proven false.Also Read: Will Jennifer Lopez join Bad Bunny at the Super Bowl halftime show?

How Kramnik and Naroditsky’s relationship evolved — from public glasses







American chess Grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky took his last breath on Sunday, at the age of 29, his family confirmed on Monday.Naroditsky, known as “Danya” in the chess community, was among the world’s top-ranked blitz players and a well-known chess commentator, author, and content creator.Till now there has no news on the reason behind the death, however, former World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik has alleged a foul play, hinting at possible drug use and alleging that signs of distress were ignored by those close to Naroditsky.Vladimir Kramnik, who previously accused Naroditsky of cheating in 2024, shared screenshots on social media from a private message sent by a viewer who had watched Naroditsky’s final stream.The message expressed concern over Naroditsky’s condition and questioned whether he was under the influence of drugs.Sharing the screenshot, Kramnik tweeted, ""What exactly happened? Because I received this two days ago from a friend of mine, chess fan, and at least did what I could to warn people to do something urgently in my posts. To those who prefer blaming and shaming instead of helping. Awful tragedy, hope properly investigated.""Before Naroditsky’s death was confirmed, Kramnik had posted several tweets suggesting the streamer was “on something else than sleeping pills.”After the news broke, he continued to criticize those close to Naroditsky, alleging they ignored signs of serious problems.In another tweet, he wrote, ""Too high price paid, but if I was the only person shouting about obvious long-term problems of Danya becoming alarming, requiring urgent measures from people around, while 'friends' only cared about hiding it and erase evidence, it’s rotten to the core.""The controversy that cast a long shadow over Daniel Naroditsky's final year commenced when Vladimir Kramnik publicly accused him of cheating through a series of online posts in early 2024.Kramnik alleged that Naroditsky used a second screen to consult chess engines, a serious accusation undermining the integrity of a professional player. Naroditsky, ranked among the world's top 75 in Rapid and top 25 in Blitz, had to defend himself in the court of public opinion.He strongly denied the allegations, stating that his streaming setup had been misinterpreted by Kramnik. In a raw and emotional response, Naroditsky described the former world champion as 'worse than dirt' for making such damaging claims without concrete evidence.The allegations compelled Naroditsky to release detailed videos defending his setup and playing style, an ordeal that visibly affected the popular streamer, International Business Times UK reported.","Daniel Naroditsky, 29, died on Sunday, his family confirmed on Monday.

Optics vs reality

""Not a sign of disintegration""

A bigger bloc, more arithmetic

Friendly fights and withdrawal loophole

Not the first messy start

NDA's campaign mode on

NEW DELHI: As nominations for Phase 1 of the Bihar assembly elections closed on Friday, the NDA appeared battle-ready, its candidate list finalised, campaign plan rolled out.Across the aisle, the opposition's Mahagathbandhan (or INDIA bloc), led by Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), continues to debate who fights where. Congress and RJD, which are still holding talks, have also declared a few of its candidates for the high-prestige contest.This, obviously, has given a big ammunition to the NDA which has claimed that the Mahagathbandhan has crumbled even before the contest.Yet, despite the optics of confusion, alliance leaders insist the delay signals expansion, not disarray.Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar, who has been part of the opposition bloc's discussions, said such coordination takes time. ""Coordination matters more than speed,"" he quipped, adding that the bloc’s final list would be announced soon.Congress leader Pawan Khera on Thursday also questioned why NDA was concerned about Mahagathbandhan's deal.Khera informed that candidates were filing their nominations and the procedure for seat distribution was under way. He affirmed clearance on the situation and mentioned that the Mahagathbandhan government will be formed in Bihar.""The work is going on very well, symbols are being distributed. Those who have to file nominations are also doing so. The process has started... Very soon, the entire situation will be clear to everyone. The Mahagathbandhan government is going to be formed. Why is the NDA raising questions? They should think about themselves,"" Khera told ANI.CPI(ML) Liberation general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya dismissed speculation of infighting within the opposition alliance.""People may feel there is chaos in the INDIA bloc. But the delay in announcing seats is because more constituents are on board this time. It’s definitely not a sign of disintegration,” he told PTI.Bhattacharya revealed that his party, which won 12 of the 19 seats it contested in 2020, would field roughly the same number this time.This year's Mahagathbandhan is more crowded than in 2020, when it included the RJD, Congress, and the three Left parties — CPI(ML), CPI, and CPI(M).Now, Mukesh Sahni’s Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) has joined the fold, while talks are under way with Hemant Soren’s JMM, which wants to contest a few border seats.Congress, meanwhile, has released its first list of 48 candidates even before the seat-sharing formula was finalised - a move that signalled both impatience and self-confidence. Among the key names are state chief Rajesh Ram (Kutumba), CLP leader Shakeel Ahmad Khan (Kadwa), and Youth Congress chief Prakash Garib Das (Bachhwara).In Bachhwara, however, CPI’s Awadesh Roy has also filed papers, creating what insiders call a ""friendly contest"", a common phenomenon in Bihar’s multi-party coalitions.Sources within the bloc told PTI said RJD has tentatively agreed to allot 61 seats to the Congress, with some negotiations still underway over high-stakes constituencies.In India’s electoral playbook, such overlaps between allies are common. When alliances negotiate till the last minute, parties often field 'friendly' candidates in the same seats, using the withdrawal window to clean up overlaps once the deal is sealed.The withdrawal window, which opens after nominations close, gives them room to tidy up overlaps once the final deal is sealed. Candidates in overlapping seats typically withdraw nominations at the last minute, leaving only the officially endorsed name in the fray.With the Phase 1 withdrawal deadline on Monday, and Phase 2 deadline on Thursday, several overlapping candidates are likely to quietly withdraw once the bloc finalises its list.This isn’t the first time Bihar’s opposition has walked into an election season with unresolved seat-sharing issues.In 2020, the RJD and Congress sparred till the eleventh hour over key constituencies, and yet, the alliance went on to deliver one of its strongest performances in years, falling just short of defeating the NDA. The Grand Alliance registered win on 110 seats out of 243. Tejashwi Yadav's RJD emerged as the single largest party in the assembly and he was election leader of opposition in the assembly.The Left parties contested as part of the alliance and performed notably well, especially CPI-ML(L) that won 12 seats. Congress secured 19 seats.That precedent might have made leaders more relaxed about the optics of delay.The NDA, by contrast, has its machinery in motion. The JD(U) and BJP are contesting 101 seats each, with allies LJP (Ram Vilas), RLM, and HAM covering the rest.The BJP’s 40-member star campaigner list, led by PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, signals a high-energy campaign. Chief minister Nitish Kumar, seeking his 10th term, is pitching continuity and stability, while the opposition bets on discontent, voter fatigue and anti-incumbency.The first phase of voting will be held on November 6, the second on November 11, and counting on November 14. For now, the NDA may have the early advantage in optics, but Mahagathbandhan's late start may not necessarily have an impact on the final results.","BJP fields Samrat Choudhary, Vijay Sinha in first list for Bihar polls.

India beat New Zealand but lose to Bangladesh.

New Zealand must defeat England in their final match.

The team with the better net run-rate (India or New Zealand) will progress to the semifinals.

NEW DELHI: India’s Women’s World Cup campaign is on a knife-edge after another agonising defeat. Chasing a target of 289 against England in Indore on Sunday, India fell just four runs short, marking their third consecutive loss in the tournament. With the win, England secured a semifinal berth alongside South Africa and Australia, leaving only one spot up for grabs. India currently sit fourth in the points table with four points from five matches (NRR +0.526), while their main competitor for the final semifinal place, New Zealand, also has four points but a lower net run-rate (-0.245).The defeat leaves India, co-hosts and pre-tournament favourites, teetering on the brink of elimination, with their semi-final hopes now resting on the outcomes of the remaining two group matches.India will next face New Zealand on Thursday, followed by their final group match against Bangladesh on October 26.A win in both games would guarantee a spot in the semifinals.If they lose to New Zealand, India will need the White Ferns to lose their last match against England and then beat Bangladesh to advance.There’s also a third scenario. If India beat New Zealand but lose to Bangladesh, and New Zealand defeat England, the team with the better net run-rate will progress.Against England, India looked on course for victory for much of the chase. Skipper Smriti Mandhana scored a commanding 88, while Harmanpreet Kaur contributed 70 and Deepti Sharma added 50.With India needing 56 runs off 54 balls and seven wickets in hand, the match seemed under control. However, England fought back brilliantly to clinch the win. Heather Knight’s classy 109 off 91 balls, in her 300th international appearance, had earlier anchored England’s total of 288/8, with Amy Jones contributing 56.India’s bowlers triggered a late collapse, but Linsey Smith and Sophie Ecclestone sealed England’s triumph in the final overs.“It’s a bad feeling when you have put so much hard work in but the last 5-6 overs didn’t go according to the plan,” Harmanpreet said after the match. “Smriti’s wicket was the turning point for us. It’s a heartbreaking moment. Credit to England. They didn’t lose hope, they kept bowling and getting wickets.”","India's World Cup campaign is on a knife-edge after another agonising defeat.

Poll What’s your view on criticism of players on social media? It helps them improve It can be harmful

NEW DELHI: Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin recently found himself in a humorous situation when a person impersonating Australian cricketer Adam Zampa contacted him on WhatsApp, asking for the phone numbers of several Indian players.Ashwin shared screenshots of the conversation on Instagram, captioning it “Fake Adam Zampa tries to strike.” The post quickly went viral, with fans loving Ashwin’s sharp and witty replies to the impersonator.The fake Zampa asked Ashwin for the contact details of players such as Abhishek Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Sanju Samson, Jitesh Sharma, Rinku Singh, and Shivam Dube. Ashwin decided to play along, joking that he would send the list and asking if those names were enough.He then turned the tables by asking the impersonator if he had MS Dhoni’s number. When the fake Zampa replied that he did, Ashwin requested the number in return. The chat ended on a hilarious note, with Ashwin quipping that he was “Compiling in Excel” when the impersonator again pressed for the contacts.This wasn’t Ashwin’s first brush with online impostors. He revealed a similar incident involving someone pretending to be his former Chennai Super Kings teammate Devon Conway.""After the IPL got over, one guy messaged me, claiming to be Devon Conway, 'Hi buddy, how are you?' and I also responded, 'We'll stay in touch. You're playing in MLC; I'll watch the games.' He then asked, 'I've lost Virat Kohli's number, can you share it?' I thought, why is he asking for Virat's number? I thought I should ask him, but I didn't want Devon Conway to misunderstand. Then I picked up Virat Kohli's card and gave him a different number,"" Ashwin shared on his YouTube channel.In a separate development, Ashwin recently defended pacer Harshit Rana after earlier questioning his inclusion in India’s ODI squad against Australia.""I have always reiterated that no player should be attacked below the belt. When the attack becomes too personal, the genre changes. I would like to talk about Sanjay Manjrekar, who has criticised me throughout my career. But I have never held any grudge against him. What they say might be right or wrong, as long as the criticism doesn't get personal, I am fine with it,"" Ashwin stated on his YouTube channel.Ashwin also voiced his concern over the psychological toll of harsh social media criticism on young players.""Assume Harshit sees the reel in which he is being harshly criticised, and he is about to play a match for India, wouldn't he be shattered by this? And if his parents and friends see it, what will be their mindset? We can definitely criticise their skill, their style of cricket and the trade that they are plying. But it shouldn't get personal. It may be funny once or twice, but it shouldn't be a running theme. The reason they are doing this is that there is an audience for it. Negativity sells these days. They sell whatever is in demand. We should avoid consuming such content,"" he added.","Ravichandran Ashwin was contacted on WhatsApp by a person impersonating Adam Zampa.

ACB statement

Poll Do you agree with Shahid Afridi's view on Afghanistan forgetting Pakistan's support? Yes, completely agree No, I disagree Not sure

Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi expressed disappointment with Afghanistan, saying it is regrettable that the country seems to have “forgotten Pakistan’s support.”“I did not expect it to be like this. For the past 50–60 years, we have been taking care of them. I personally look after nearly 350 Afghan families in Karachi,” Afridi told Pakistani media.He also highlighted Pakistan’s decades-long assistance, including hosting millions of refugees and providing direct help to families in need.“I believe that both are neighboring countries, and our message has always been to the people of Afghanistan that both sides should cooperate because we are Muslim countries,” he said.Without mentioning India directly, Afridi urged Afghan leaders to preserve the fraternal relationship and prevent outsiders from exploiting their land against Pakistan.“It is regrettable that instead of sitting down and discussing things directly, you went and shook hands with those who have been involved in terrorism inside Pakistan for a long time. We have always welcomed you, provided you a place, and people have lived, worked, and done business here.It is unfortunate that you went and shook hands with those who are carrying out terrorism inside our country.”The controversy comes after the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) pulled its team from a tri-series in Pakistan next month, following the deaths of three local cricketers in a Pakistani military strike. In a post on X, the ACB said that after the airstrikes, it decided not to send its team to Lahore and Rawalpindi for the November T20 tri-series, which also involved Sri Lanka. Zimbabwe has replaced Afghanistan.The deceased players — Kabeer, Sibghatullah, and Haroon — were returning home after a friendly match in Sharana, the capital of Paktika province.Earlier this month, Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi visited India for a week of talks — a previously unimaginable move.

'Unfair at this stage!': Virat Kohli's childhood coach on the treatment of senior duo Virat-Rohit

India face mounting pressure following their disappointing loss in the first ODI against Australia at Perth's Optus Stadium. The match, which was initially anticipated as a celebratory return for Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, resulted in India conceding a 1-0 series lead.Australia won the toss and elected to field first. The Indian batting lineup struggled to cope with the challenging conditions in a rain-affected match.India managed to score 136/9 in their allocated 26 overs, with the target being adjusted to 131 for Australia through DRS. Both Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli had brief stays at the crease, scoring 8 off 14 balls and 0 off 6 balls respectively.In the bowling department, Arshdeep Singh provided an early breakthrough by dismissing Travis Head. However, the Australian team comfortably achieved the target with seven wickets in hand and 29 balls remaining.The entire Indian bowling attack appeared ineffective, with Harshit Rana receiving particularly harsh criticism from fans. His selection for the series has been a topic of debate, with some suggesting his inclusion was influenced by his association with coach Gautam Gambhir Rana's performance in his four-over spell yielded no wickets while conceding 27 runs.This outcome has intensified the scrutiny surrounding his selection and capabilities at the international level.The Indian team now needs to regroup quickly as they prepare for the second match of the three-game series. The upcoming game is scheduled for October 23rd in Adelaide.The pressure will be particularly intense for Harshit Rana, who needs to prove his worth at the international level. A loss in the next match would put India in a difficult position to salvage the series.The match has highlighted concerns about team selection and performance under pressure. The Indian team's ability to bounce back will be tested in the upcoming Adelaide fixture.The rain-interrupted nature of the first match added to the complexity of the game, but the overall performance has raised questions about the team's adaptability in challenging conditions.India's batting collapse in the shortened format and the inability of their bowling unit to defend even a modest target has become a point of concern for the team management.The return of senior players Rohit and Kohli was expected to strengthen the team, but their early dismissals contributed to India's struggles in the match.The upcoming match in Adelaide presents an opportunity for the team to address these issues and level the series. The focus will be on both individual and collective improvement.Australia's commanding performance in chasing down the target has put additional pressure on India to respond strongly in the second ODI.The loss has sparked discussions about team selection strategies and the balance between giving opportunities to new players while maintaining team performance at the international level.The team management faces the challenge of making necessary adjustments while maintaining confidence in their selected players ahead of the crucial second match.","India conceded a 1-0 series lead to Australia in the three-match ODI series.

Kirk Cousins’ Father: Faith, leadership, and lifelong guidance



Mary Ann Cousins : Dedication, family roots, and athletic heritage



Kirk Cousins’ career seemed set when he signed a four-year, $180 million contract with the Atlanta Falcons. The veteran quarterback looked ready to lead, yet the NFL is nothing if not unpredictable. When Atlanta used the No. 8 draft pick to select Michael Penix Jr., the landscape shifted. Suddenly, every practice, meeting, and headline carried a new tension. Amid the uncertainty, one constant has remained: the unwavering support of his parents, Mary Ann and Don Cousins. Their guidance and faith have shaped the quarterback who refuses to fade from the spotlight.Don Cousins, Kirk’s father, is a longtime pastor and author whose faith and leadership left a lasting imprint on his son. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in Biblical Studies from Trinity International University and spent 17 years as an associate pastor at Willow Creek Community Church, one of the nation’s largest Evangelical megachurches. Don later founded Team Development Inc., guiding Christian leaders through speaking, writing, and consulting.His influence on Kirk’s athletic journey is undeniable. Don coached his son in Little League Baseball and encouraged him to play multiple sports, shaping both his skill and discipline.Even personal challenges could not dim his guidance—after being diagnosed with cancer in 2015, Don received a game ball from Kirk following a standout performance against the New Orleans Saints, a moment that reflected their deep bond.Mary Ann Cousins, Kirk’s mother, brought dedication and consistency to the family. Raised in Iowa, she studied nursing at the University of Iowa and spent over three decades as a flight attendant with United Airlines. Her family had a rich athletic tradition: her father, Ralph Woodard, played for the Iowa Hawkeyes, as did her uncle, Dick Woodard, who also had a four-year NFL career.Mary Ann’s influence is equally powerful in shaping Kirk’s character. Her work ethic, loyalty, and support instilled values that extended to his professional life. Alongside Kirk, the Cousins family includes Kyle and Karalyne, both athletes growing up. Kyle played college baseball and now directs Mission Increase Foundation in Orlando, while Karalyne became a doctor in Florida. Kirk’s strong relationship with his parents and siblings provided a stable foundation amid the pressures of the NFL.Through faith, family, and unwavering support, Mary Ann and Don Cousins have played a vital role in Kirk’s journey, proving that a quarterback’s greatest strength often comes from the lessons learned at home.Also Read: Who is Mac Jones’ girlfriend?

Mac Jones’ girlfriend Sophie Scott: From Roll Tide to NFL supporter



Sophie Scott’s support: More than just Football



Mac Jones’ rise from Alabama quarterback to NFL star has been remarkable, but he hasn’t navigated it alone. By his side from the start has been Sophie Scott, his college sweetheart. The couple’s journey began at the University of Alabama, where their shared passions and early support for one another laid the foundation for a lasting relationship. From campus moments to NFL stadiums, Scott has remained a constant cheerleader for Jones’ career.Sophie Scott and Mac Jones started dating in 2019 while both were at Alabama. Scott, raised in St. Louis, Missouri, attended Kirkwood High School before joining the Crimson Tide, ultimately earning a degree in kinesiology and exercise science in December 2020. When Jones was drafted by the New England Patriots in 2021, Scott moved to Boston to support him, often spotted in the stands at practices and games. Their bond deepened through shared experiences, from volunteering at local camps to giving back to the community.Scott has used her Instagram platform to document their life together and model for brands, while Jones himself has dabbled in modeling. “I used to be a child model/actor, or whatever, and that was fun,” Jones told WEEI 93.7’s Merloni & Fauria in 2021.Their shared media presence highlights a couple equally comfortable in the spotlight.Beyond their social posts, the couple shares a love of philanthropy. Jones’ $100,000 donation to the Boys and Girls Club of Metro South in 2022 was a team effort, with Scott joining him at Camp Riverside to engage with children. “From the moment we arrived at the camp, we were greeted by smiling campers just like these who wanted nothing more than to have fun. And that is exactly what we did!” Scott wrote on Instagram, emphasizing the couple’s commitment to supporting young people.Scott’s support for Jones extends far beyond cheering from the stands. She celebrated his NFL draft journey with heartfelt Instagram posts and accompanied him to his first Patriots practice. The Alabama alum even became a viral sensation in 2022 after calmly handling a minor kitchen fire at home, proving her poise under pressure. Whether making fiesta dip or coordinating matching Patriots jerseys with their dog, Scott has shown that her support for Jones is both practical and personal.The couple has maintained a balance between NFL life, personal passions, and memorable experiences, including attending a Taylor Swift concert together in 2023. Their relationship blends shared goals, genuine affection, and a commitment to each other that began in college and continues to grow.

Taylor Swift Gives Full Breakdown Of TS12 Album 'The Life Of A Showgirl'

Critics raise concerns over “trad wife” themes and conservative undertones



Taylor Swift’s latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, was expected to mark another high point in her storied career. Instead, it’s ignited a cultural debate, one that extends far beyond music. Since its release on October 3, Swift’s 12th studio album has drawn criticism from some fans and commentators who say certain lyrics hint at racial undertones and possible digs at Kayla Nicole, the Black journalist and influencer who once dated Travis Kelce, Swift’s fiancé.When Swift sings, “But I’m not a bad b*h and this isn’t savage,” on her track “Eldest Daughter,” many online listeners immediately pointed out its resemblance to the iconic lyrics from Megan Thee Stallion’s “Savage.”Critics argue that the line could be a veiled reference to the women Kelce dated before Swift, several of whom were Black ,including Kayla Nicole. Others note the lyric from “Opalite”, “Sleepless in the onyx night but now the sky is opalite”, as a subtle racial dog whistle.Social media users, particularly on TikTok, have dissected these lyrics frame by frame, suggesting that the album’s tone feels dismissive toward Black femininity.While no direct reference to Nicole is made, fans argue the timing, coming amid Swift’s high-profile romance with Kelce, makes the subtext hard to ignore.Swift’s comments about prioritizing Kelce over career ambitions have also raised eyebrows. During an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Swift said one reason she wouldn’t headline a Super Bowl halftime show was because she was “too concerned about Kelce.” Some critics say this shift, from independence to devotion, mirrors the “trad wife” trend on TikTok, where women glorify domesticity and traditional gender roles.While Swift hasn’t addressed the backlash directly, cultural commentators argue that “impact matters more than intent.” As one writer noted, even unintentional microaggressions carry weight when you’re one of the most influential women in the world, especially when your lyrics may touch on the intersections of race, femininity, and fame.Whether the controversy fades or grows, The Life of a Showgirl has already achieved one thing: it’s forced the public to confront how celebrity narratives, including those involving Travis Kelce and his past relationships, shape the cultural conversation around identity and power.Also Read: Despite being far richer than Travis Kelce, why is Taylor Swift insisting on a prenup before marriage?","Taylor Swift's new album, 'The Life of a Showgirl,' is sparking debate over lyrics perceived to have racial undertones.

From social media sparks to a fairytale wedding in Rhode Island

A new chapter of love, faith, and family

Former Miss Universe Olivia Culpo and San Francisco 49ers star Christian McCaffrey have officially entered a new chapter of their picture-perfect love story, becoming parents. The couple, who welcomed their first child, daughter Colette Annalise, in July 2025, are celebrating a milestone that feels years in the making for fans who have followed their journey from flirtatious Instagram likes to walking down the aisle.Their romance began in 2019, when McCaffrey liked one of Culpo’s Instagram posts, a simple gesture that fans now see as the start of something special. Just months later, the two were spotted vacationing in Mexico, confirming the rumors that a new power couple was emerging. By the end of the year, Culpo proudly wore McCaffrey’s jersey at a Panthers game, and soon after, they made their relationship Instagram official.Over the years, the model and the athlete became one another’s biggest supporters, Culpo cheering from the sidelines and McCaffrey publicly defending her from online criticism.The NFL star once wrote, “She doesn’t need my money bubbs,” after a rude comment surfaced, reminding fans that his admiration for her goes beyond fame.Their shared milestones, including McCaffrey’s trade to the 49ers in 2022 and Culpo’s continued modeling success, only strengthened their bond.Their June 2024 wedding in Rhode Island was nothing short of a modern fairytale. Culpo told Vogue her goal was simplicity and grace: “I didn’t want it to exude sex in any way, shape, or form. I wanted it to feel effortless and as if it’s complimenting me, not overpowering me.”Just months after their wedding, Culpo revealed her pregnancy in March 2025 with the heartfelt caption, “next chapter, motherhood 🤍.” Now, with baby Colette’s arrival, the couple’s once-glamorous love story has transformed into a beautiful family narrative.Culpo later reflected on the experience, calling motherhood “the scariest and most rewarding of all experiences.” For two people who built their relationship on faith, loyalty, and admiration, their growing family marks the ultimate touchdown, one filled with love, humility, and the promise of a lifetime together.Also Read: “Never fails to blow me away”: Travis Kelce is all praises for Patrick Mahomes’ relentless drive as Chiefs reclaim their dominance",Olivia Culpo and Christian McCaffrey have welcomed their first child.

Patrick Mahomes’ leadership continues to inspire a championship mentality

Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce once again showed why his bond with Patrick Mahomes is one of the strongest in NFL history, not just on the field, but in the locker room as well. Following the Chiefs’ dominant 31–0 win over the Raiders, Kelce opened up about Mahomes’ mindset and leadership, giving fans a glimpse into what keeps Kansas City’s dynasty alive.Despite the Chiefs facing early-season struggles and public doubts about their offensive chemistry, Kelce made it clear that Mahomes’ work ethic has never wavered. “He’s just always gonna do what he can to get better,” Kelce said, reflecting on his quarterback’s consistent pursuit of excellence.The two-time MVP’s preparation and drive have defined the team’s culture under Andy Reid, creating an atmosphere where complacency simply doesn’t exist. “That’s why I love playing with him,” Kelce added. “That’s why this team is gonna get better throughout the year, because we all have that mentality.”Even after multiple Super Bowl titles, the Chiefs’ leaders continue to emphasize growth over glory.

Shane Beamer speaks out amid Virginia Tech rumors while vowing to refocus South Carolina for a comeback,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/shane-beamer-speaks-out-amid-virginia-tech-rumors-while-vowing-to-refocus-south-carolina-for-a-comeback/articleshow/124698472.cms,"Shane Beamer (Image credits: IG/X)

Shane Beamer dismisses Virginia Tech rumors and tells players he’s fully committed to South Carolina

South Carolina’s struggles only reinforce Beamer’s determination to fix the program

Virginia Tech legacy makes headlines, but Beamer’s future remains firmly in Columbia

Amid a turbulent start to the season and swirling speculation linking him to Virginia Tech, South Carolina coach Shane Beamer made it clear on Sunday that his focus is entirely on his team. With the Gamecocks struggling in the SEC, Beamer reassured both players and fans that his commitment to Columbia has not wavered, and his energy is dedicated to turning around a disappointing start.Beamer addressed a CBS Sports report claiming multiple members of Virginia Tech’s search committee were advocating for his return. The 48-year-old coach, who played at Virginia Tech and later served as an assistant under his father, Hall of Famer Frank Beamer, said the report had no basis and his loyalty lies firmly with South Carolina.“I have no idea where that story came from,” Beamer said during his Sunday teleconference. “I have conveyed publicly many times how much I want to be here. This is my dream job. I said that when I came here, nothing has changed. I am pissed off at the way we are performing right now, and it's not acceptable. I came here to win a championship, and right now we're not getting it done, and my focus right now is on getting it fixed. ... We're in a storm right now that I’m going to get us out of.”He told his team personally that any notion of him seeking a “parachute” or soft landing elsewhere was false, emphasizing that all his attention is on improving the team’s performance.Saturday’s 26-7 loss to No. 14 Oklahoma dropped the Gamecocks to 3-4 overall and 1-4 in SEC play, highlighting a rough patch after a 9-4 season last year. Despite the challenges, Beamer insists that this is a moment to double down on accountability and rebuild the team’s culture.“When you’re 3-4, there’s all kinds of noise and chatter and speculation out there about all kinds of things,” Beamer said. “I wanted to make sure our players understood that I’m not focused on anything but getting this right. And that I’m gonna get it right.”Beamer’s connections to Virginia Tech are deep — he played there from 1995-99 and was an assistant under his father from 2011-15. Frank Beamer, South Carolina’s coaching legend, built the Hokies into a national powerhouse. Yet Shane’s commitment to South Carolina is reinforced by a contract through 2030 that pays $8.15 million this season, with a $5 million buyout if he departs early.While speculation may continue, Beamer’s message is clear: his energy, focus, and loyalty remain with the Gamecocks as he works to turn around a difficult season.Also read: Aryna Sabalenka and boyfriend Georgios Frangulis’ relationship timeline: A complete look at their romance, support, and viral moments so far",South Carolina coach Shane Beamer dismissed speculation linking him to Virginia Tech.

Brock Purdy injury update: How long will the 49ers quarterback be sidelined with his toe injury?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/brock-purdy-injury-update-how-long-will-the-49ers-quarterback-be-sidelined-with-his-toe-injury/articleshow/124698465.cms,"Brock Purdy injury update (AP Photos)

Brock Purdy injury update : What it means for the 49ers



49ers’ Season outlook hinges on Brock Purdy’s recovery



San Francisco 49ers fans are holding their breath as Brock Purdy’s lingering turf toe injury drags on, threatening to derail the team’s early-season momentum. What was first seen as a minor setback in Week 1 against the Seahawks has snowballed into a prolonged absence, leaving the 49ers leaning on backup Mac Jones. Every update seems to bring more uncertainty, and with playoff hopes on the line, the pressure is mounting both on Purdy and the team.Purdy suffered the injury in the season opener against the Seattle Seahawks and briefly returned in Week 4 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, only to aggravate the toe. NBC reporter Melissa Stark shared that Purdy described the injury as “so annoying” and cautioned that “any movement in the wrong direction could set him back.” The quarterback is dealing with a hyperextension of his right big toe, which tore stabilizing ligaments under the joint—a serious injury that limits planting and pushing off, vital movements for any quarterback.Despite optimism for a potential Week 8 return against the Houston Texans, Purdy himself stressed that he remains “truly day-to-day.” The cautious approach is understandable, given the severity of turf toe and the risk of further setbacks if he returns too soon.Meanwhile, Mac Jones has guided the 49ers to a 3-1 record in his first five starts, proving capable but still unable to replicate the full impact of Purdy’s presence on the field.Purdy’s absence couldn’t come at a worse time. After signing a five-year, $265 million extension, he is the cornerstone of San Francisco’s offense, and the team’s strategy revolves around his return. With key players like Nick Bosa and Fred Warner sidelined for the season, and multiple injuries across the wide receiver corps, the 49ers are navigating a challenging roster landscape.San Francisco’s medical staff is prioritizing long-term health over rushing Purdy back, hoping that a full recovery will allow him to return stronger for the second half of the season. The team remains atop the NFC West at 4-2, but their ceiling is undeniably higher with Purdy at quarterback. Fans can only wait and hope that the star signal-caller returns at full strength, ready to steer the 49ers deep into the playoffs.Also Read: Who Are Kirk Cousins’ Parents?

Poll Who do you think will perform better in the second ODI? Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma

NEW DELHI: A lot of anticipation surrounded the first ODI in Perth, which India lost by seven wickets (DLS), as two of the game’s stalwarts, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , returned to the side after months. Both players had already retired from T20Is and Tests, making their comeback in the highly anticipated series opener against Australia at Optus Stadium even more significant.For Kohli, it marked his first ODI appearance since lifting the Champions Trophy on March 9 in Dubai.Virat was in a jovial mood from the start, interacting with teammates, sharing laughs, and cracking jokes.Ahead of the match, during the national anthem, he stopped and asked captain Shubman Gill and vice-captain Shreyas Iyer to lead the team and stand first in the line.However, Kohli’s return ended in disappointing fashion, as he was dismissed for a duck.Watch the video here Australia’s spin-bowling all-rounder Cooper Connolly dived to his left to complete the catch at point. Mitchell Starc thus became the second bowler to dismiss Kohli for a duck twice across all internationals, after James Anderson.Before Kohli’s exit, Rohit Sharma’s eagerly awaited comeback was short-lived. Making his 500th international appearance for India, Rohit was dismissed for eight runs by Josh Hazlewood after edging the ball to second slip, where debutant Matthew Renshaw took the catch.India now turn their attention to the second ODI against Australia, scheduled for Thursday at Adelaide Oval, Adelaide, hoping to bounce back and level the series after a tough start in Perth.","India lost the first ODI against Australia by seven wickets in Perth.

Arshdeep Singh Press Conference After IND vs AUS 1st ODI: Praises Captain Gill, Backs Virat Kohli

NEW DELHI: Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has expressed confidence that Indian stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma will bounce back strongly in the second ODI against Australia in Adelaide, following their disappointing returns in Perth. Gavaskar said it would be no surprise if the two senior batters deliver big scores, emphasising that it’s only a matter of time and practice before they regain their rhythm.Kohli and Rohit returned to international cricket after a seven-month break but struggled on Perth’s challenging surface, scoring 0 and 8 respectively. Australia capitalised on India’s batting collapse to secure a comfortable seven-wicket win, taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Gavaskar defended the duo, stressing that adjusting to Perth’s bounce after such a long layoff was always going to be difficult.“They were playing on probably the bounciest pitch in Australia. It wasn’t going to be easy, especially for players who haven’t played international cricket for a couple of months. It was challenging even for Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer, who play regularly,” Gavaskar was quoted as saying by India Today.The former India captain remained optimistic about India’s prospects, pointing out that once Kohli and Rohit spend more time at the crease and in the nets, they’ll quickly rediscover their touch.“India are still a very, very good team. Don’t be surprised if Rohit and Kohli score big in the next two games. The more they play, the more time they spend in the nets, the quicker they’ll find their rhythm. Once they’re back among the runs, India’s total will be 300, 300-plus,” Gavaskar added.The second ODI in Adelaide presents ideal conditions for a turnaround, particularly for Kohli, who has an outstanding record at the venue.In four ODIs at Adelaide Oval, he has scored 244 runs at an average of 61, including two centuries.His Test record there is even more remarkable, with 537 runs in five matches at an average of 53.70, featuring three hundreds.","Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma returned to international cricket after a seven- month break.

Poll Do you think India will secure a spot in the World Cup semifinals? Yes, they will win at least two matches. No, they will struggle in the remaining matches.

Despite two consecutive three-wicket defeats to Australia and South Africa, India’s ace all-rounder Deepti Sharma remains optimistic about the women’s team’s World Cup campaign. Speaking to the media on Saturday, ahead of the must-win match against England at the Holkar Stadium in Indore, Sharma stated, “We have lost two matches, but our morale is very good because we played two good matches at the start. ”Hosts India are set to resume their campaign after a week’s break and must win at least two of their remaining three matches to guarantee a spot in the semifinals. Sharma noted that during the hiatus, the team devised specific strategies for the remaining games.“It was a very good break. We have to realise how we can make better plans. As a team, we did a lot of bonding activities,” she said.India, vulnerable against left-arm spinners, will face challenges from Sophie Ecclestone and Linsey Smith on Sunday. Sharma affirmed that the team has prepared for various obstacles.Sharma holds extensive familiarity with the England squad, owing to her experience in international cricket , the Women’s Premier League (WPL) with the UP Warriorz, sharing the dressing room with Sophie Ecclestone, Danni Wyatt-Hodge and Lauren Bell, and her stint in The Hundred for the London Spirit.“I know how their bowling and batting set-ups are, as I have played a lot of matches against them.

Cowboys’ defensive challenges with Trevon Diggs sidelined for Commanders clash



Trikweze Bridges and Caelen Carson to fill key roles in Dallas’ secondary



The Dallas Cowboys will face a major defensive challenge this Sunday as star cornerback Trevon Diggs has been sidelined for the matchup against the Washington Commanders. Head coach Brian Schottenheimer confirmed Friday that Diggs entered concussion protocol following an accident at home on Thursday night, ruling him out for the upcoming game.Diggs’ absence comes at a critical time for the Cowboys, whose defense is struggling this season, ranking near the bottom in both yards and points allowed. Despite this setback, Schottenheimer emphasized that the team’s defensive strategy remains intact. “It doesn’t change. We adjust always on defense when we get into gamedays anyway,” he said, signaling confidence in the team’s game plan against a high-powered Commanders offense.To fill the void left by Diggs, the Cowboys will rely on backup players such as Trikweze Bridges and Caelen Carson. Bridges has impressed during practices, showing readiness to step up, while Carson could return to bolster the secondary. Schottenheimer underscored the NFL’s “next man up” philosophy, stressing that the team is prepared to adapt and execute its plan despite missing a key starter.The Cowboys’ defensive struggles make Diggs’ absence particularly significant.Analysts expect the Commanders to test Dallas’ secondary early and often, putting pressure on linebackers and safeties to cover gaps and force turnovers. The performance of Bridges and Carson could be decisive in keeping the Cowboys competitive and limiting scoring opportunities for Washington.Player safety remains a top priority, and details about the severity of Diggs’ condition are still emerging. Schottenheimer confirmed that Diggs was evaluated by the team’s medical staff on Friday, with updates pending as he progresses through concussion protocol. The Cowboys are focused on his well-being while preparing for a crucial NFC East matchup.As Sunday’s game approaches, the focus shifts to how the Dallas Cowboys will adjust without Trevon Diggs.

Revisiting Carter Hurt’s experience with the Philadelphia Flyers

Vegas Golden Knights goalie Carter Hurt has made his long-awaited return to the NHL after his controversial long court battle. After a prolonged absence from professional hockey due to the charges pressed against him of sexual assault in a high-profile case, Hurt is joining the Vegas Golden Knights on a professional contract tryout, as the team claimed on Thursday. However, reports suggest that Hart and the others are not eligible to play in games until December 1, as part of the league’s reinstatement process for him. Let’ take a closer look at what the goaltender has to say about his return to the league after a long hiatus. NHL goalie Carter Hurt has made his long-awaited return to the league on Thursday, as announced by the Vegas Golden Knights on Thursday. The goalie has joined the team on a professional tryout contract basis, following a long-fought legal battle. Earlier, Hart played six seasons with the Philadelphia Flyers before stepping away from the game amid significant legal and organizational developments.Following the signing of the contract with the Golden Knights, the goaltender stated, “I’m beyond grateful, excited, and honored to be part of the Golden Knights.” He further said, “It’s been a long road to get back to this point, getting back to playing the game of hockey, the game that I love.I’ve been out of the game for a year and a half now. I’ve learned a lot. I’ve grown a lot. Just excited to move forward.”On his joining, the Vegas Golden Knights officially announced that, “Following the reinstatement decision agreed on by the National Hockey League and the National Hockey League Players’ Association, goaltender Carter Hart will be joining the Vegas Golden Knights organization.”In addition to this, the team stated, “The Golden Knights are aligned with the process and assessment that the NHL and NHLPA made in their decision.
