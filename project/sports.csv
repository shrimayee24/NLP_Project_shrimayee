NEW DELHI: Ahead of the second Test, there was a lot of debate on out-of-form KL Rahul and in-form Sarfaraz Khan for a spot in the Playing XI for the fixture in Pune. After India's loss in the opening Test in Bengaluru, the key question was who should be picked for the next match — KL Rahul or Sarfaraz?At the toss in Pune, Rohit revealed the three changes in India XI and ended the KL Rahul vs Sarfaraz debate by picking Sarfaraz over the Karnataka batter.Along with Sarfaraz, Washington Sundar and Akash Deep were also brought in while KL Rahul, Mohammed Siraj and Kuldeep Yadav were dropped.Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra believes that time is running out for KL Rahul, who has struggled in red-ball cricket recently.""Of course, the pressure is building because of his form. It is also unfair to start judging a player or to start picking or dropping him based on a single performance. He hasn't really been very good in the last 8 or 10 Test matches. That's also a fact. So, time is running out,"" Chopra said in a select media interaction.Chopra, who played 10 Tests for India between 2003 and 2004, is currently an expert with JioCinema and Sports18 for the India vs New Zealand series. The former India batter also highlighted that Sarfaraz's consistent run-scoring has increased the pressure on KL Rahul.Since making his debut against England in Rajkot earlier this year, Sarfaraz has played four Tests, scoring 350 runs at an impressive average of 58.33, including three half-centuries and a century.""Sarfaraz has already scored 150 in the last Test match. That pressure is also there on KL Rahul. The team also knows that KL Rahul is basically an opener, but he has been pushed up and down the order way too many times. It is not fair for someone to always be in the line of fire and asked to adjust. But, yes, the team is backing him, but in the end, it's all about scoring runs. So, there will be pressure on KL Rahul now. There's no doubt about it,"" Chopra added.","KL Rahul has struggled in red-ball cricket recently. Aakash Chopra believes that time is running out for the Karnataka batter. Sarfaraz has scored 350 runs in four Tests, including three half-centuries and a century.

Revitalised India win second Test 5-3; Germany win the following shootout to clinch two-match hockey series,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/hockey/top-stories/revitalised-india-win-second-test-5-3-germany-win-the-following-shootout-to-clinch-two-match-hockey-series/articleshow/114566928.cms,"(Hockey India Photo)

NEW DELHI: ""Keep faith in yourselves and stay calm,"" coach Craig Fulton told the Indian players when the team went into a huddle at half time, trailing 0-1 in the second hockey Test against Germany here on Thursday.The Indians had played much better in the first half than they had the day before, but the game was threatening to go out of their reach due to their inability to convert the chances that came their way.Having failed to score even once on Wednesday, the team was desperately in search of a goal to boost their confidence. That moment came four minutes into the second half when a young Shilanand Lakra got hold of the ball near the German circle and passed it to Sukhjeet Singh whose reverse hit got India their first goal of the series.That goal changed everything. The team which was struggling to beat the German deep defence for the second straight match, suddenly looked possessed. In the next three minutes India forced three penalty corners. They failed to score from any of them but that did not deter them as they kept hammering at the German defence.The sustained pressure cracked the German defence open as India pumped in four goals within a period of six minutes, including three in three minutes. First Harmanpreet Singh scored from a penalty corner, India’s 9th, hitting the ball to the top of the net. He followed up with a powerful ground shot to the goalkeeper’s left in the next penalty corner to make it 3-1 for India. Two minutes later, Vishnukant Singh’s long pass from near the half-line to Abhishek inside the German circle was well intercepted, and he turned around to hit it to the right of the goalie.Stunned by the series of reverses, Germany pushed forward offering Sukhjeet enough space and the chance to increase the lead in the 48th minute.Sukhjeet, running with the ball, dodged past a couple of defenders before tapping the ball in while diving as the goalkeeper tried in vain to defend his citadel.There were still 12 minutes left and the fifth goal virtually sealed the fate of Germany. The visitors managed to score two goals in the remaining time through Elian Mazkour (57th) and Henrik Mertgens (60th) with the final goal coming just two seconds before the final hooter. This was Mazkour’s second goal of the match, having scored the first goal in the 7th minute of the match.""What we couldn’t do yesterday, we did today,"" an elated Fulton said after the match. ""We played well yesterday but we were not sharp. Today, we improved our game and were full of energy to score some good goals. The younger players also contributed well.""Germany won the two-Test series as they won the shootout (3-1) that followed Thursday’s match since both teams had won one Test each.Germany coach Andre Henning admitted that his players were getting tired as the match progressed and that India made the most of it. ""India were extremely strong during that phase. We were really struggling. We couldn’t manage to hold the speed. We were just not defending consistently anymore. And that’s why they almost deserved to score five times,"" Henning told TOI.Indian striker Mandeep Singh summed up the game aptly. ""If you score a goal, you get charged up. And that’s what happened today.""",India score four goals in six minutes to beat Germany 5-1 in second Test match. India had failed to score even once on Wednesday and were trailing 0-1 at half time.

Kerala Blasters bank on attack as they face BFC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/kerala-blasters-bank-on-attack-as-they-face-bfc/articleshow/114556322.cms,"KOCHI: The rivalry between Kerala Blasters and Bengaluru FC has always been intense, both on and off the field. As the two teams prepare to face each other for the first time this season at the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium, Kochi on Friday, fans are expecting another high-octane clash.Bengaluru are enjoying an impressive unbeaten run and are on top of the table, while Blasters, with their recent form, are expected to pose a significant challenge to the former champions.Since losing their opening match against Punjab FC, Blasters remained undefeated in their last four outings, securing two wins and two draws. In the 15 previous ISL meetings between the two sides, Bengaluru emerged victorious on nine occasions, while Blasters won just four fixtures, with two games ending in draws.However, Bengaluru have struggled historically at Kochi, never keeping a clean sheet at the Blasters' home venue and losing three out of the five matches played here. Their record of not conceding a goal this season might be put to the test against Blasters, especially with the home side playing attacking football with Noah Sadoui, Adrian Luna, and Jesus Jiminez in top form.The return of talismanic midfielder Luna to full fitness will boost the Blasters' confidence. ""I think of course we are three good players, but we need more time to play together. But so far Noah and Jesus are doing fantastic. I played 90 minutes after a long time (against Mohammedan Sporting). I need to catch up with them and hopefully we will continue to be good throughout the season,"" said Luna on match-eve.Blasters head coach Stahre emphasised their approach, stating, ""We want to play a fast, confident game. We strive to be highly competitive, and for each match, we have different game plans. About 80 per cent of our strategy is based on our core philosophy, while the remaining 20 per cent is tailored to adjustments for each game."" Sunil Chhetri , who scored seven goals against Blasters, will again be a threat. But the man to watch out for will be Nikhil Poojary , who recorded an impressive average of 24 forward passes per game this season and will look to make a difference in the midfield.","Bengaluru are enjoying an impressive unbeaten run and are on top of the table.

Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra led the New Zealand batting effort, scoring 76 and 65 runs, respectively, after captain Tom Latham won the toss.Off-spinner Sundar finished with impressive figures of 7 for 59, while fellow off-break bowler Ravichandran Ashwin took 3 for 64, helping to dismiss New Zealand in just 79.1 overs.","Rishabh Pant was caught on the stump mic telling spinner Washington Sundar to bowl a bit fuller to Kiwi tailender Ajaz Patel.

PUNE: Washington Sundar has added another feather in his cap. He was a kind of 'super sub' in the absence of Virat Kohli and many others when India won the Brisbane Test , and with that the series Down Under in 2020-21. Now, he is India's 'super addition'.Drafted into the second Test as a 16th member after the Bengaluru reversal, Washington came up with a dream spell of 7/59, including 7/28 in 61 balls and gave India's campaign a much-needed boost.After scoring 152 in Delhi in a Ranji match, his second-highest first-class score, he came up with his best-ever first-class bowling effort in Pune on Thursday. He is playing in only his fifth Test.Washington labelled the turnaround within 10 days as ""God's plan"" and thanked the team management and selectors for giving him an opportunity. On the Rachin dismissal, he said, ""When it happens, it is magical.""He also hoped that he would get more chances to play whenever India opts for a three-man spin attack. A left-handed batsman, Washington said the experience of playing red-ball cricket (Ranji) helped him a lot in regards to his rhythm with bat and ball. He also emphasised on the need to be accurate on this track.When Luke Ronchi said some of the Kiwis batsmen were ""unfortunately"" out, he was not way off the mark. For, it was that kind of a magical day for Washington. ""Washington showed consistency,"" said the NZ batting coach. ""He bowled wide of the crease, got the drift and made batsmen play.""He also said that the pitch did not turn as much as they thought it would. Ronchi reckoned that after looking at the behaviour of the pitch in the first session, the Indians bowled slower and also varied their pace on a pitch which doesn't have consistent bounce.However, Washingon said that after the ball became soft, he and Ashwin discussed about ""more speed and putting more body into the balls"". The venue is also special to Washington as he had made his IPL debut in 2016 for Pune here after Ashwin was injured.When Washington takes someone's place, he is doubly dangerous.","Washington Sundar came up with a dream spell of 7/59, including 7/28 in 61 balls.

NEW DELHI: The third Test between Pakistan and England in Rawalpindi made history by rewriting the record books with a statistic that had occurred only once before in the history of the game.England's first innings marked only the second instance in Test history where no pace bowling was delivered in the first innings of a match.The first occurrence dates back to 1882, when Australia's Joey Palmer and Edwin Evans bowled 115 four-ball overs against England at the SCG.After England opted to bat first, Pakistan handed the new ball to spinners Sajid Khan and Noman Ali , who immediately took advantage of the dry pitch, offering turn and low bounce from the outset.This marked only the fourth instance in Test cricket history where two spinners opened the bowling with the new ball on the first morning, and the first time it happened in Pakistan.Sajid and Noman, who shared all 20 England wickets in their series-levelling victory in Multan, bowled a combined 42 consecutive overs together.Pakistan did not use a third bowler in the morning session and Aamer Jamal, their lone seamer, did not bowl in the England innings in a fair indication of how spin-friendly the wicket is.Sajid (6-128) and Noman (3-88) tore through England's batting lineup, while Zahid Mahmood contributed with figures of 1/44. Salman Agha bowled just one over but remained wicketless.After a rearguard 89 by Jamie Smith enabled England to post 267, having stuttered to 110-5 at lunch. England fought back to reduce Pakistan to 73-3 at close on the opening day of the series-deciding third Test.On a dry, spin-friendly Rawalpindi pitch, 13 wickets fell on the first day, with all but one claimed by spinners.Gus Atkinson was the lone fast bowler to take a wicket, dismissing Kamran Ghulam for three.","England's first innings marked only the second instance in Test history where no pace bowling was delivered in the first innings of a match.

Can Washington succeed Ashwin?

Chennai: October 24, 2024, will undoubtedly go down as a red-letter day in Tamil Nadu cricket history as two ‘sons of the soil’ joined forces to bag all 10 wickets for India in a Test innings .On the opening day of the second match in Pune on Thursday, the returning Washington Sundar ran through the New Zealand middle and lower-order with a personal-best seven-wicket haul after fellow off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin removed the top-three.The masterclass from Washington and Ashwin effectively made it a mini contest between TN and NZ, with the finger spinners from the southern region of the country emerging well on top in the end. The ‘brothers of destruction’ brought huge cheer to everyone associated with cricket in TN, a state that has a history of producing fine slow bowlers.“It was fantastic to see two off-spinners from TN combine to pick up all 10 wickets in an innings. Washington was a surprise element; no one would have expected him to pick up seven wickets. It is a great thing for him as well as TN cricket. When it comes to Ashwin, he has been consistently doing well and is expected to be among the wickets,” M Venkataramana , former India off-break bowler and TN head coach, told TOI.With pride swelling in his voice, M Senthilnathan, a former TN player who coaches MRF Globe Trotters SC – the TNCA first-division team which Washington plays for – said: “Washington can be a lethal weapon with the ball on turning tracks. Washington and Ashwin have shown in this Test that they can play together. The TN guys did it (10 wickets) together. They bowled NZ out.”As Ashwin is at the twilight of his glorious career, the selectors and management are busy finding an able successor for the maestro. Washington fits the bill and has made a strong case on his Test comeback.Asked if Washington can be a like-for-like replacement for Ashwin after the latter hangs up his boots, Venkataramana said: “So far, he has proved himself in white-ball cricket. In international red-ball cricket , this is the first time he has performed so well with the ball. He has to keep improving. He has to work harder to have the skills to bowl well on good batting tracks. If he does that, he will be very good in the future. His past experience in the India team will help.”Senthilnathan said that Washington has the wherewithal to operate in a spin-heavy attack. “He will be a star performer for India in the years to come. Ashwin has been doing very well. There is an option to play both of them. If Ashwin continues to play like this, why not have both of them in the XI? When we can play two left-arm spinners in the XI, why cannot we have two right-arm off-spinners in the team?”",Washington Sundar and Ravichandran Ashwin took all 10 wickets in India's innings. The 'brothers of destruction' brought huge cheer to everyone associated with cricket in Tamil Nadu.

🔴 LIVE: Can India Bounce Back in Pune? | KL Rahul and R Pant to Enter IPL Mega Auction 2025

PUNE: India head coach Gautam Gambhir 's assertion that trying to win the second Test against New Zealand is the top priority - and that it will take precedence over planning for the tour of Australia - has cleared the fog.It makes sense because not taking any chances, taking their best XI to the park and winning this series will put India in the best position to qualify for the World Test Championship (WTC) final at Lord's from June 11. The first of five Tests in Australia starts in Perth on November 22.It can now be said with certainty, barring last-minute fitness issues or a change of heart, that Shubman Gill is taking the place of KL Rahul in the team for the second Test of the series starting at the Gahunje stadium from Thursday. There is a strong possibility of pacer Akash Deep coming in for Mohammed Siraj.The strategy of playing three spinners will continue, albeit with a change in personnel - meaning either left-arm spinner Axar Patel or off-spinning left-handed batsman Washington Sundar is likely to take left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav 's spot. Gambhir said Gill and Rishabh Pant were fit and available for selection.Kiwi captain Tom Latham said, ""Our job is to adapt as quickly as possible. We can't control the pitch. Going into the match without preconceived ideas is a strength of this team.""New Zealand, however, will have to decide whether to keep their three-man pace attack from the first Test - Tim Southee, Matt Henry and William O'Rourke - or bring in an additional spinner in Mitchell Santner.Sometimes, the playing XI also decides your preference at the toss. And that can backfire too.On his achievement of leading the Black Caps to their third-ever Test win on Indian soil in the preceding Test, Latham said, ""That was last week. We celebrated what was a special performance. But our attention turned quickly to this game. We don't want to rest (on the laurels) of last week.""But we do want to take confidence from that win going ahead. The win shows that we can come over here and we can compete. But we realise that both teams start on zero for this game. We are hoping to put India under pressure by doing correct things on a consistent basis,"" Latham added.One of those correct things could be not going into a shell and using decisive footwork - like Rachin Ravindra did in Bengaluru - against the Indian spinners.In the last Test against South Africa at this venue in 2019, Virat Kohli had slammed a well-controlled double hundred. If the pitch behaves like a typical Indian wicket, the former India skipper, expected to be back at his favoured No. 4 batting spot behind Shubman Gill, could well come up with another big one.Latham said, ""We expect India to be at their best over the next few days.""Not allowing the home team - especially openers Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal - to be at their best will be their primary task.If the track is a raging turner, India will not be safe either. Unfancied spinners have troubled India big time in the past.Besides Ajaz Patel's 10 wickets in an innings in Mumbai in 2021, there are examples of Aussies Steve O'Keefe (12-70, Pune 2017), Matthew Kuhnemann (6-76, Indore 2023) and England's Tom Hartley (7-62, Hyderabad, January 2024) troubling India big time with their left-arm spin.","India head coach Gautam Gambhir says trying to win the second Test against New Zealand is the top priority. Shubman Gill is taking the place of KL Rahul in the team. New Zealand captain Tom Latham said, ""Our job is to adapt as quickly as possible""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114526939,imgsize-73258,width-400,resizemode-4/114526939.jpg"

🔴 LIVE: IND vs NZ: Rohit Sharma & Co. Get Their Playing XI Right | Washington Makes Instant Impact

AHMEDABAD: Pacer Saima Thakor (2/26) and Tejal Hasabnis (42 off 64b; 3x4) got their India careers off to a strong start as they played lead roles in India's 59-run win against New Zealand women at the Narendra Modi Stadium here on Thursday. The two debutants impressed after the Indian women were bowled out for 227 in 44.3 overs. Smriti Mandhana , leading the side in the absence of an injured Harmanpreet Kaur , opted to bat first.But she fell to a rather tame dismissal as she guided a wide ball outside the off stump to point. Shafali Verma (33 off 22b; 5x4, 1x6) and Yastika Bhatia ( 37 off 43b; 5x4) played solidly but failed to convert their starts.A 61-run 5th-wicket stand between Jemimah Rodrigues (35 off 36) and Hasabnis brought stability to the innings. But after Jemimah was trapped in front by Suzie Bates, India's lower order showed acute lack of game awareness to bat out the 50 overs. The experienced Deepti Sharma (41 off 51b; 2x4, 1x6) was left to do the heavy lifting all by herself as Amelia Kerr (4/42) and Jess Kerr (3/49) proved handful for the hosts.India, for once, made up for their poor batting with a good bowling and fielding display. Saima got India off to a great start when she dismissed Bates caught behind for one with an outswinger off the third ball of her career.

PUNE: India opted for the control of off-spinner Washington Sundar over Kuldeep Yadav 's left-arm wrist spin while picking the spin combination for the second Test. Once Sundar was drafted in as an additional member of the team after the first Test defeat, the chances of him getting a game in Pune were high.Whether it was really due to the theory of his balls turning away from the left-handers — even Kuldeep and Ashwin do that — the nature of the track on offer could have played a part in his selection.That he offers an extra batting cushion too was a factor.India also dropped middle-order batsman KL Rahul and pacer Mohammed Siraj for the fit-again Shubman Gill and Akash Deep respectively.Once India lost the first Test and team management decided to field the best XI for the day without bothering too much about game time before the tour of Australia, it was clear multiple changes were always on the cards.Before the toss, former India coach Anil Kumble said on the official broadcast that it was necessary to retain KL Rahul — over Sarfaraz Khan, who made 150 in the last innings — and Kuldeep. But the current team management thinks differently.Kuldeep's absence from the first-ever Test in Pune (2017 vs Australia) was also a prickly matter. According to the grapevine, coach Kumble wanted him to give him a debut but captain Virat Kohli's thinking prevailed. Kuldeep finally got a game in the fourth and final Test of that series in Dharamshala.Kumble's argument on Thursday for sticking with Kuleep and Rahul was about consistency, giving them a decent rope if there is no dramatic drop in their contributions, and not getting confused with immediate form.In his last 10 Test innings, Rahul has scored one hundred and two fifties. Plus his experience is seen as valuable for the Australia series. Kuldeep in his last five Tests has taken 22 wickets.Siraj's replacement Akash was given only three overs at the start, and Bumrah four.Akash Deep bowled only six overs on a spin-friendly wicket and went for almost seven runs an over.",Washington Sundar was drafted in as an additional member of the team after the first Test defeat.

Top Picks For You India vs New Zealand: Washington Sundar adds dash of magic to team's plans

🔴 LIVE: IND vs NZ: Rohit Sharma & Co. Get Their Playing XI Right | Washington Makes Instant Impact

PUNE: At 197/3 after 59 overs, the Kiwis would have been happy with the way things were unfolding after winning the toss. The visitors, up 1-0 in the series, had not allowed pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep any breakthrough and it appeared both the Tamil Nadu offspinners — Washington Sundar and R Ashwin — were being kept under reasonable control.Daryl Mitchell’s unconvincing stay had begun to give India some heartburn.And the century-maker in the first Test, Rachin Ravindra (65 off 105b, 5x4s, 1x6), was batting beautifully, with soft hands and assured footwork. He was not wasting too many scoring opportunities.But Washington, not in the original plan of the selectors, had other plans. He put on a show on how to bowl on a responsive pitch — don’t try hard to turn the ball, allow the pitch to do the damage by sticking to the correct principles of bowling. After all, a marginal turn can yield more wickets than a big turn. In the process, the 25-year-old ended with figures of 7/59, which included five batters being out bowled. Before Washington started his magic, Ashwin was 3-48. He ended with 3-63. The two hardly bowled in tandem.All the wickets that India took came from the pavilion end and only one catch was taken in the outfield, as two were out LBW and two caught behind the wicket.India bowled out New Zealand for 259 in the 80th over and then made 16-1 in 11 overs at stumps, losing Rohit Sharma for a nine-ball duck to Tim Southee.India got the visitors’ last seven wickets in about 20 overs, conceding 62 runs. It was a rare instance of two bowlers from one state (Tamil Nadu) and one craft (off-break) taking all 10 wickets for India in a Test innings.At the Gahunje stadium, the ball nicked the off stumps thrice. First, Washington angled the ball in and moved it away from lefthanded Rachin’s bat. Though the batter tried to cover the off-stump with his bat, the red cherry still found a way to clip the stumps. Southee was castled when Washington bowled wide of the crease around the wicket — the ball pitched between leg and middle and skidded to kiss the off stump.This beautiful sight was repeated during the last half an hour of play, though India were at the receiving end this time around. Southee’s ball cut and moved away and left captain Rohit Sharma helpless in overcast and floodlit conditions as his off stump was disturbed.After removing Rachin with an almost unplayable delivery, Washington had Tom Blundell with a classical off-spinner that went between the bat and pad. Then he trapped Daryl Mitchell LBW with a beautiful seam position as aerodynamics and turn came into play.In between, Glenn Phillips played into India’s hands by lofting Washington to deep mid-off without any force or connection when Ashwin was posted there exactly for that type of shot.India didn’t taste success for more than seven overs in the morning and got the first success in the first over of spin. Ashwin’s smart thinking of allowing Devon Conway a single to the long-on fielder placed only for that ball worked well. Tom Latham, a southpaw, was trapped LBW the next ball.Ashwin also removed Conway (76 off 141, 11x4s) who had started to give India a headache with his unconventional batting style. The batter tried to work through the turner when he could have played forward, and nicked it to Pant for a sharp catch against the run of play.Then, Sarfaraz Khan, stationed at short-leg, insisted on a review which found the ball brushing Will Young’s bat. Going by the assessment of coach Luke Ronchi, the pitch and helplessness of finding a seemingly unplayable ball has already started to play on the visitors’ minds.Now, India will hope to bat only once in this match. They have to tackle the pace of Southee and Williams O’Rourke. The Kiwis have drafted in left-arm spinner Mitchell Santer (scored 33 important runs) in place of Matt Henry.",India bowled out New Zealand for 259 in the 80th over and then made 16-1 in 11 overs at stumps.

Joining him to mull over India's playing XI and a momentous day for Washington Sundar were Times of India 's Gaurav Gupta, Manuja Veerappa and Sahil Malhotra.The panel, understandably, lauded Sundar's outstanding bowling performance, which helped India dismiss New Zealand for 259 runs at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium.Sundar, who came in for Kuldeep Yadav, claimed seven wickets for 59 runs, supported by Ravichandran Ashwin, who took three wickets.New Zealand's innings featured Devon Conway's solid 76 and Rachin Ravindra's 65.In response, India ended the day at 16 for 1, with Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal at the crease after losing captain Rohit Sharma for a duck.The day was marked by strong individual performances as New Zealand struggled against India's spin attack.India made three changes to their playing XI for the Test — KL Rahul has been left out, while fit-again Shubman Gill returned to the playing side. In-form Sarfaraz Khan, who scored 150 runs in the second innings at Bengaluru in the first Test, kept his spot.For New Zealand, pacer Matt Henry missed out due to an injury, with left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner came into the playing XI.","Washington Sundar took seven wickets for 59 runs.

AHMEDABAD: Stand-in captain Smriti Mandhana hailed India's bowling and fielding efforts as they bounced back from a ""tough"" phase to secure a win against New Zealand in the first ODI of the three-match series.India's Women's T20 World Cup campaign earlier this month had ended in a disaster as they failed to reach the semifinals following a 58-run defeat to Sophie Devine's New Zealand, who went on to win the tournament.However, this time, Devine's side fell short of chasing a modest 228, losing to India by 59 runs in the ODI series opener.""It's been a tough 1.5 to 2 months, so it feels good to start with a win. If you don't believe in cricket, you won't succeed,"" said Mandhana, who captained in place of Harmanpreet Kaur , during the post-match presentation.Harmanpreet was rested for this game because of an unspecified niggle.Indian batters also could not convert their starts and kept losing wickets at regular intervals to be bowled out for an under-par 227 in 44.3 overs.""We had a talk that we were under-par but if we field well, we could add 20-30 runs. Saima set the tone for us with Suzie's wicket,"" Smriti said of the debutant seamer who bagged 2 for 26.""She (Saima) has been around with us (for the past couple of months). She has been brilliant throughout and we have seen her work really hard. Really happy for her and hope this is just the start for her,"" she added.Saima said: ""I have been very patient, the team is amazing. That is the secret. It was a flat wicket honestly. It was a batter's paradise. But we did really well as a bowling group and luckily, it (the result) came into our favour.""T20 World Cup-winning NZ captain Devine was run out for two in a bizarre fashion after stepping down the track and tapping the ball back to the bowler.Bowler Deepti Sharma quickly threw it to wicketkeeper Yastika Bhatia, who removed the bails with Devine's foot just outside the crease as the TV umpire confirmed the dismissal, giving India a key breakthrough and leaving New Zealand at 46/3.""I thought she was outside her crease, so I felt throwing it (to Yastika) was a good option,"" said player-of-the-match Deepti who hit a 51-ball 41 and returned with 1/35 from nine overs.",India beat New Zealand by 59 runs in the first ODI of the three-match series.

NEW DELHI: Luke Ronchi , the assistant coach of New Zealand, stated that the team would aim to emulate the strategy employed by the Indian spinners when the second day of the second Test in Pune begins.The Indian spinners, particularly Washington Sundar and Ravichandran Ashwin , effectively varied the speed of their deliveries to take wickets and restrict New Zealand's first innings total.Sundar claimed an impressive 7 wickets for 59 runs, while Ashwin chipped in with 3 wickets for 64 runs.Their combined efforts limited New Zealand to a score of 259. In response, India reached 16/1 at the end of the first day's play.""If you notice, for the first couple of sessions, the Indians were bowling quite quick -- the spinners -- and towards the back end they started to slow their pace,"" Ronchi told the media after the day's play.Ashwin and Washington devised a strategy to induce a collapse in the New Zealand batting lineup, which had reached 197/3. The plan involved mixing up the pace of their deliveries to unsettle the batsmen.Ashwin struck first, dismissing three top-order batsmen. Washington then took charge, claiming the remaining seven wickets, achieving his best-ever figures in Test cricket.""That sort of made for variable, a bit more turn and bounce and variable sort of reactions off the surface, so that's something we can use in our bowling innings, knowing that changes of pace are quite significant,"" he added.Ronchi praised Washington for maintaining consistent lengths on the first day, allowing him to maximize the surface's potential.""It was just this consistency of being able to hit a good area for long periods of time. There were some balls that went really wide in the crease.""He got some good drift and the ball that got Rachin (out) was from really wide and straight and hit (the off stump). That's a really nice ball to bowl for anyone,"" he said.Ronchi mentioned that although the pitch at the MCA Stadium didn't provide as much spin as expected, the key for New Zealand would be to maintain tight bowling against the Indian batters.""Both teams could quite easily say at the start of the day, they thought this wicket would turn more than it has so far, but again, it's just about tomorrow for us, build pressure, bowl in some good areas and get that ball (off) variable bounce,"" he added.""We saw some balls today really jumped off a length and then some stayed a little bit, they just skidded through a little bit, it's going to be a surface where maybe as the game goes on you're not going to feel like you're actually in,"" he added.",New Zealand assistant coach Luke Ronchi says his side will aim to emulate Indian spinners. Ravichandran Ashwin and Washington Sundar took seven wickets each on day one. New Zealand were bowled out for 259 in their first innings.

Many times in cricket, a fielder throws a probing catch towards the wicketkeeper in an attempt at catching the batter off. There is equal parts desire to bring about a dismissal and there is also an attempt to keep the batters on their toes.The first India vs New Zealand ODI in Ahmedabad on Thursday produced one such moment. In the 12th over, with New Zealand 46/2, Sophie Devine came down the track to Deepti Sharma and played a defensive shot back.Sharma, after a little wait, threw the ball back towards the stumps where wicketkeeper Yastika Bhatia whipped off the bails and asked the umpire if there was a chance for a run out .On the face of it, it didn't look to be a threatening situation at all. The batters were not trying to steal a run and it was simple for Devine to make her way back to behind the line.Instead, her foot was found to be on the outer part of the line. The TV umpires confirmed that she was indeed short of ground. A combined presence of mind between Deepti and Bhatia helped India deliver a crucial blow and resulted in celebrations - even in the dugout.Batting first, India scored 227 runs in the first of three ODIs - well below the par total as the hosts folded with 33 balls to spare at the Narendra Modi Stadium .The Kerr sisters, Amelia and Jess, combined to take seven wickets. Eden Carson and Suzie Bates chipped in with two and one wickets respectively.The bane of the Indian innings was the batters' inability to convert the starts they got.Deepti Sharma (41), debutant Tejal Hasabnis (42), Shafali Verma (33), Yastika Bhatia (37) and Jemimah Rodrigues (35) started off the block in fine fashion but were unable to build on.The lone bright spots in India's innings was a 50-plus alliance – a 61 between Rodrigues and Hasabnis for the fifth wicket.","New Zealand were bowled out for 227 in the first ODI against India.

Excerpts:

How did the comeback to Chennaiyin happen?

How did you feel when you returned to Chennaiyin for selection?

When Coyle decided to sign you, what were his expectations?

You are yet to make a competitive appearance since returning to CFC. Are you fully fit and prepared to get back into action?

How did you remain in good shape when you were away from the East Bengal first team?

What would you like to achieve in your second stint at Chennaiyin

Edwin Sydney Vanspaul endured tough times at East Bengal FC after joining the Kolkata giants last year. Edwin was sparingly used by former East Bengal head coach Carles Cuadrat in the Indian Super League 2023-24 season and was later left out of the first team.Beginning the new season with the East Bengal reserve side, the Tamil Nadu player kept a sharp lookout for options to resurrect his career.Edwin turned to a familiar face and contacted Chennaiyin FC chief coach Owen Coyle , who he had worked with during his first spell at the southern ISL team.The attempt yielded a positive result as the 32-year-old terminated his East Bengal contract and returned to Chennaiyin, for the ongoing 2024-25 season. In an interaction with TOI, Edwin, a versatile player who can operate in midfield and defence, spoke about how the transfer to CFC materialised, the conversations he had with Coyle, his role in the team and more.I took the initiative to talk to Coyle. Everyone knew that I was finding it difficult at East Bengal. Signing for East Bengal was a good thing, but it did not go the way I wished. I did not get enough game time, so I thought whether I should stay at East Bengal or look for opportunities elsewhere. I first messaged Coyle, I asked him if there was an opportunity and told him that I was looking forward to play. We were getting towards the end of the summer transfer window and the club had completed most of the signings by then. But I made one last try. Coyle asked me to come and conducted trials for about a week. He told me clearly that he would sign me only if I am good enough. He was satisfied with how I performed in the trials.Coming back and having the touch of football felt different. I was extremely happy. I was under a lot of stress at East Bengal and was worried about what would happen next. When I joined the Chennaiyin camp, I was able to forget all the stress I had; it did not even cross my mind. Coyle has given me a new life following a period of struggle. He is always honest with his players, that is what I like about him the most. I cannot express my feelings in words.Coyle told me that he knows how I played in the ISL 2019-20 season. I responded that I am no longer young (laughs). He then said: “You need not match the speed of the youngsters. I want you to show them that you are pushing them for a spot in the team.” The way he demands is different; knowing what we have, he will get the best out of us.Personally, I am ready for everything; I am ready to do whatever the coach asks of me. That is the mentality I returned to Chennaiyin with. I had prepared myself for that. When I spoke to the coach, I told him: “It does not matter where you play me or how long you play me… 10 minutes or 20 minutes. I am fit and ready to give my 100 per cent.” Coyle explained to me that we are following a process and that I will get opportunities in the coming matches.I knew that I would get a chance one day, and I kept myself ready for it. When I played in the East Bengal reserve team, I learnt from the youngsters. A number of them are good. Whenever I took the field, I played with seriousness. That helped me a lot during my selection at Chennaiyin. Had I taken things lightly when I was in the East Bengal reserve team, I would have struggled to show my best in the CFC trials.When I left CFC last year, some fans messaged me saying that I left the club only because East Bengal offered me a better salary. I went there for a challenge. Had I gone there for money, I would not have come back to Chennaiyin. There were some things that needed to be worked out during my contract termination; I could have stayed there since I had a year left. Football is everything for me. I went to Kolkata for a change and I wanted to experience the derby. I managed to do it and the derby experience was great. Having come back to CFC, I want to act as a mentor to the youngsters and talk to them about the situations I have experienced over the years. I want to motivate the young players to give their best. I just ask them to be ready for every opportunity that comes their way. Whenever the youngsters need help, I will be there to explain how to navigate the tough situations.",Edwin Sydney Vanspaul is yet to make a competitive appearance since returning to Chennaiyin FC.

Forced changes for CFC:

CHENNAI: The Indian Super League matches between Chennaiyin FC and FC Goa have been goal fests more often than not, irrespective of the coaches and players involved.The Chennaiyin-Goa fixtures have seen 95 goals in 26 meetings, the most between any two teams in the league's history. Given the preference of both coaches - Owen Coyle and Manolo Marquez - to play a positive brand of football, the 'century' mark could be breached on Thursday, when CFC welcome Goa to the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here.Chennaiyin head into their second home game of the season after scoring three past NorthEast United FC and getting back on track with a thrilling victory.CFC, who have earned seven points from four matches, will be boosted by the good form of their overseas recruits Wilmar Jordan Gil and Lukas Brambilla. Striker Gil scored a double in the previous outing, while Brambilla showed flashes of the 'Samba' magic and opened his goal-scoring account. Not surprisingly, ahead of the trip to Chennai, Manolo emphasised that CFC have ""dangerous"" players at their disposal.""You know how Coyle's teams play. My feeling is that he has the players he wants this season. Chennaiyin have two good strikers (Gil and Daniel Chima Chukwu) and young Indian players who are growing. It will be difficult for any team to beat Chennaiyin. They will fight till the last moment [in every match],"" said Manolo.Visitors Goa have had an indifferent start to the season, securing five points off as many games, but have not had a problem in rippling the net. ForwardArmando Sadiku has been in sizzling form, leading the chart alongside NorthEast's Alaeddine Ajaraie with five goals each, and will have the company of Borja Herrera , a creative midfielder who netted a match-winning hat-trick against East Bengal FC recently.Wary of the threat that Goa carry, Coyle said: ""We certainly like to play on the front foot. We are an attack-minded side. Manolo has good pieces in his team and we have to be ready for them. Sadiku is a top striker; he can hit from anywhere outside the box, never mind when arriving in the box. Borja was one of the outstanding players in the league the other week."" Goa have been defensively poor, shipping in 10 goals leading to no clean sheets.Coyle will be forced to rejig his backline due to the unavailability of two domestic players. While Laldinliana Renthlei is suspended after picking up a red card in the last game, Ankit Mukherjee is set for a spell on the sidelines with an injury.","Chennaiyin-Goa fixtures have seen 95 goals in 26 meetings, the most between any two teams in the league's history.

(Photo Credit: KSLTA/Deepthi Indukuri)

For Tanisha Kashyap , 22, the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week will remain special for many reasons, not least because it's her first one on the pro circuit.""This one's really special because it's in my home country, in India, and it's something that I've waited for a while,"" Tanisha said.""I'm really glad how I performed in the week I was actually injured.I had a neck catch which led to my shoulders because of the continuous matches that I played.""And it was tough each and every match to play with that pain, but I managed it really well. Mentally, I stayed strong and I relied on my fitness to win this title.""Tanisha, world ranked 868, overcame Akanksha Nitture 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-1 in the final of the hard court event.The triumph was made all the more memorable by the difficult start to the season wherein she was rendered out of action for three months after undergoing a ""mini surgery"" to treat a meniscus and ACL tear.Tanisha suffered the injury during an event in Monastir, Tunisia, in early April. She was leading in the second set against Finland'sAnastasia Kulikova , a former top-200 player with nine pro titles, when she felt pain but played through it. It was only the following day when she underwent scan, she discovered the full extent of the injury.""I cannot disclose what treatment I got, because I was treated by (Daniil) Medvedev's doctor … (I was) set back for three to four weeks,"" she said.""I was completely off from tennis. I was on crutches. I didn't play for three-four (sic) months. I was just building back my fitness and building the strength of my knee and everything.""So I would say this year has been tough, mentally, physically, and I had to face a lot adversities in the beginning because it was not looking that great.""But through it all, I stayed positive and didn't lose sight of my goal. I worked hard each and every day to build myself back up from injury … to get to where I'm right now, to lift my first pro title.""The time away from action and the subsequent comeback helped her understand her game better.""When I did start, it was also very tough, because when you start to play tournaments, you're trying to figure it out again because there's some pain or there's a certain movement that's bothering you.""So you have to find out, you have to go back and do therapy. It was a process to figure it out and to also strengthen my quads back up to support my knee. So, it was tough.""But, sometimes when there's a lot of chaos, when you have a lot of time, you can really think about tennis from an outside perspective, and you get to know yourself better.""Tunisia seems to be Tanisha's favourite hunting ground, at least this year, and it was for a reason.""The best probable reason why I frequently played in Monastir (is) because I've been boarding in All In Tennis Academy (in France), and it's very close,"" she said.""It's not that expensive to travel, not much of jet lag. And the level of the tournaments in Monastir are way, way, much higher than other places.""And I was still fresh off an injury. If you're injured and suddenly go to Thailand, what do you do? You go to Indonesia, you spend all that money for two weeks and you might not perform well.""It was in Monastir while she was finding her way back in July that she first felt a catch in the neck, which forced her to retire from a $15K event in the second round when she was leading 6-2, 4-1 against Spaniard Victoria Gomez O'Hayon.It was the same issue that cropped up in Bengaluru at the very start of the tournament, and she showed tremendous grit to play through the pain and obvious discomfort it put her in.""Right before my first round, in a certain movement, I jerked it, and I had the same neck catch again,"" she said.""I couldn't look up, I couldn't look to my right, I couldn't serve. And I think throughout this tournament, I had so many double faults. I'm sure the statistics are there.""It taught me something. I stayed strong, I battled each and every point. I ran for each and every shot. I didn't, you know, let anything go. So, that fighting spirit really helped me win this tournament.""And, of course, some strategy here and there, and to play smart tennis.""Smart tennis she did have to play in the final which lasted two hours and 19 minutes.""I knew that I had limited range of motion, and I knew that I couldn't blast my first serves, how I was blasting in Mysuru or before. So I knew that I had to tennis wise, play smart, and place the ball and start off the point and stay in the rallies for my match.""For sure, the neck started to act during the first set, which lasted more than an hour and a half. She delivered nine double faults in the opener, compared to just one for the remainder of the match.""When I was four or five down, my neck started to really catch again, and it was really extremely painful. So I had no other option to call the physio,"" Tanisha said.""The second and third, I took a breather. I just kind of meditated and focused on my game strategy … to place the balls away from her striking zone and to make her work for each and every point.And maybe she wasn't expecting, maybe she thought that I would be tired out and I wouldn't fight back. But I've always been a fighter, and I stayed strong mentally and just stayed in it, and I let her make the errors.""I was calm and cool. I can't explain it, but you know, I just went into my zone.""Tanisha has been mainly coached by her father Suresh Kalita. But she had worked with former Davis Cupper Vishaal Uppal and Billie Jean King Cup player Rushmi Chakravarthi among other coaches. She also had a short stint at the JC Ferrero Tennis Academy in Spain before heading to the Ohio State University to play college tennis.Having seen her share of tennis abroad, the Assam native believes that while the ""commitment level and fitness level"" were the areas where Indian players lagged, it was not necessary that they had to relocate to elsewhere to make the breakthrough.""We can definitely do that here as well. Like I said, it depends on the individual and how much they want to do it.""They might be doing the same exercises that the Europeans are doing, but it's not up to the standard that the Europeans are doing. In the sense, the effort, the physical ability, how much you are pushing yourself.""I've always believed that it's an individual's choice. And, there are some great tennis coaches, fitness coaches here. But in the end of the day, it's how hard you push yourself.""As for herself, Tanisha is not ready to rest on her Bengaluru laurels.""""This is just the beginning of something,"" she said, ""it's a good achievement, but I'm looking for more. I'm gonna get back to train and recover, to win some more, hopefully soon.""It's just one of the small stepping stones towards the bigger picture and the bigger goal.""","Tanisha Kashyap, 22, won the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week.
