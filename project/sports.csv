NEW DELHI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) announced the 18-member Indian team for the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia, set to commence on November 22 in Perth.The squad features new additions in the form of Abhimanyu Easwaran, Harshit Rana, and Nitish Rana.India's pace attack looks formidable, with Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj leading the charge.Akash Deep retains his place after impressive performances against England and Bangladesh, while Prasidh Krishna makes a comeback following rehabilitation for a stress fracture. The Karnataka seamer showcased his skills during India A's recent Duleep Trophy victory.Harshit and Nitish, both medium-pace all-rounders, have earned their maiden Test call-ups after stellar performances in the IPL and domestic cricket.Washington Sundar, who claimed seven wickets in the first innings of the ongoing second Test against New Zealand in Pune, has also been included in the spin department.However, Axar Patel has been omitted from the squad.The most significant talking point is the absence of Mohammed Shami , who has been working to recover from ankle surgery.Despite his rehabilitation progress, a recent knee swelling has cast doubt on his availability.Shami, however, on Sunday shared a video on his social media showcasing his bowling in the nets.India's Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav has also been left out as he seeks long-term treatment for a chronic left groin issue at the BCCI Centre of Excellence.BCCI said in a statement, ""Kuldeep Yadav was unavailable for selection for the tour of Australia since he has been referred to The BCCI Centre of Excellence after the end of the ongoing Test series against New Zealand for long term resolution of his chronic left groin issue.""Mukesh Kumar, Navdeep Saini, and Khaleel Ahmed have been named as reserve players.

NEW DELHI: In a major blow to India's prospects in Australia, pace ace Mohammed Shami has not been included due to his knee injury for the five-Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy next month. The selectors have been forced to pick an inexperienced pace attack in the 18-member team announced on Friday.Vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah will be the pace spearhead and will have Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Prasidh Krishna and Harshit Rana for support. Seam-bowling allrounder Nitish Reddy has been included as the management wants someone who can bat at No. 7 or 8 and also play the role of a fourth seamer in Australian conditions.Interestingly, the three travelling reserves — Mukesh Kumar, Navdeep Saini and Khaleel Ahmed — too are all pacers. That indicates how unsure the team management is without the services of Shami. TOI had reported on Oct 2 that Shami has developed swollen knees and could be out for six to eight weeks. The team management was looking for tall fast bowlers who can hit the deck. That's why Krishna made the cut.Rana has been backed by head coach Gautam Gambhir . Saini too has shown good form in the ongoing domestic season and he also has the experience of playing in Australia during the last tour in 2020-21.Kuldeep Yadav has been ignored for the tour as he has a chronic groin issue. Washington Sundar has made the cut and Axar Patel has been left out.Washington made a memorable Test debut in the famous win at the Gabba on the last tour. “Kuldeep was unavailable since he has been referred to the BCCI centre of excellence for long-term resolution of his chronic left groin issue,” BCCI secretary Jay Shah said.Abhimanyu Easwaran has been picked as the third opener.The selectors also announced the T20I team to play four matches in South Africa from Nov 4. Upcoming pace sensation Mayank Yadav was rested from the Suryakumar Yadav-led squad as a precautionary measure since he has fluid retention in his back.Rohit Sharma (c), Jasprit Bumrah (vc), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant (wk), Sarfaraz Khan, Dhruv Jurel (wk), R Ashwin, R Jadeja, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Prasidh Krishna, Harshit Rana, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Washington Sundar.Suryakumar Yadav (c), Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (wk), Rinku Singh, Tilak Varma, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Ramandeep Singh, Varun Chakaravarthy, Ravi Bishnoi, Arshdeep Singh, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Avesh Khan, Yash Dayal.","Mohammed Shami ruled out of Border-Gavaskar Trophy with knee injury.

NEW DELHI: In response to India's loss to New Zealand in the second Test match in Pune, former cricketer Anil Kumble expressed his disappointment, attributing the defeat to the Indian team's lackluster batting performance.By securing a 113-run victory at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium on Saturday, Tom Latham's New Zealand team achieved a historic first-ever series win on Indian soil.This loss brought an end to India's impressive 18-series unbeaten run at home, which stood as the longest such streak for any team.With New Zealand now holding a 2-0 lead in the three-match series, the final Test is scheduled to take place at the renowned Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on November 1.In his conversation with Jio Cinema, Kumble underscored the importance of each Test match in India's quest to reach the World Test Championship (WTC) final.""I think that's the beauty of the WTC. Although the series is over for India, each Test match remains crucial. They've made things harder for themselves. At the start of the series, we talked about needing five wins to comfortably reach the championship final. But now, with four wins required from the next six matches, it's even tougher, especially with one game against this confident New Zealand side at Wankhede and five more in Australia,"" Kumble said.Kumble commended India's bowling attack and pointed out that their ability to take 20 wickets in the series has kept them at the top of the WTC points table.However, he stressed the urgency for India's batsmen to start contributing runs.""India have done exceptionally well in their last two series in Australia, but qualifying now is even more challenging. They need to get their act together. The batting has been disappointing, and though the bowling will continue to face challenges, India are at the top because their bowlers have consistently taken those 20 wickets. The batting needs to step up and deliver runs,"" he added.",New Zealand secured a historic first-ever series win on Indian soil. New Zealand now holds a 2-0 lead in the three-match series.

IND Defeated at Home Ground After 12 Years: India's Bowling Incomplete for BG Trophy Without Shami

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan batter Basit Ali feels Indian players were 'overconfident' ahead of the start of the series against New Zealand and that resulted in the hosts succumbing to their first home series loss in 12 years.After their clinical triumph in the opener in Bengaluru, New Zealand beat India in three days in the second Test in Pune to claim their first-ever series win in India.Basit said that New Zealand's 2-0 series loss in Sri Lanka and Rohit Sharma and Co. winning the Bangladesh Test in two days made them overconfident. But the Kiwis did their homework before the India tour and exposed their batting completely in the first two Tests.""I had said chasing 350-plus will be too difficult. There had to be ton from one of the top three batters. India's batting got exposed. In the first match, Kiwi pacers took 17 wickets. In the second Test, spinners took 19 wickets. India players were neither able to play pacers well nor spinners. On a track that had pace and bounce (Bengaluru), India lost and on a spinning track, India lost as well,"" Basit said on his YouTube channel.""The match India won against Bangladesh in two days and New Zealand's 2-0 defeat in Sri Lanka, the team might have thought they would beat the Kiwis easily. This means, Indian management and Indian players were overconfident. New Zealand did their homework. They had nothing to lose. No one would have thought that the Kiwis might be able to defeat India. Even New Zealand themselves wouldn't have thought of something like this. But they did their homework,"" he added.The BCCI also recently announced the squad for the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy and Basit feels that without Mohammed Shami India will have a lot of problems Down Under.Basit said that with only Siraj out there along with youngsters, the entire load will be on Jasprit Bumrah on the marquee tour.""I am surprised (mujhe hairat hai) why there is no Mohammed Shami in the squad for the Australia tour. You have put all the load on Bumrah. Arshdeep (Singh) could have been in the squad because he brings variety. In this team, India's fast bowling is not complete without Shami.

India lose second Test against New Zealand by 113 runs in Pune

TimesView The shattering defeat is a blow to India's WTC final aspirations. The reasons for the series loss are multiple. But one thing is clear: some top players are a pale shadow of their former selves and fast approaching their expiry date. It wouldn't be prudent to change horses midstream in this WTC cycle. In any case, the team for the Australia tour has already been announced. But the generational change must be carried out, without fear or favour, over the next 12 months. To procrastinate would be self-damaging.

PUNE: Ability to rotate the strike. Sharpness in the field. Flexibility with strategy and captaincy. Perennial underdogs New Zealand showed that sometimes these things matter more than the big shots, both in terms of personnel and batting style.Without their most skilful and experienced batsman Kane Williamson , New Zealand hammered India - who had the likes of captain Rohit Sharma and stalwart Virat Kohli in the ranks - by 113 runs in the second Test at the Gahunje stadium with two days to spare.The Tom Latham-led team's historic first-ever Test series in India and the home team's first defeat in their own backyard in 18 series - after a span of 12 years - may not be as dramatic as Australia ending West Indies' unbeaten run at Sabina Park in 1995. But it underlined that cool minds can defuse firepower in an elegant way.On an extremely helpful pitch, left arm spinner Mitchell Santner took his best career haul of 13-157 (7-53 & 6-104) to give a new lease of life to his career. He would like to travel with the Gahunje pitch. But such pitches, made with special instructions from the team management, cannot be imported. Santner bowled unchanged for 29 overs as India tried to chase 359 as if there is no tomorrow and folded for 245.It's not the first time that India have succumbed to spin at home. There have been newcomers like Aussies Steve O'Keefe (Pune 2017), Matthew Kuhnemann (6-76, Indore 2023) and England's Tom Hartley (7-62, Hyderabad 2024) who have also had an impact. But this time it came not against a newbie but Santner, a veteran of his craft.India took lunch with great hope as Ravindra Jadeja and dashing left-handed batsman Yashasvi Jaiswal (46; 36b, 3x4s, 3x6) gave them some respite. They had taken five Kiwi wickets for 58 runs in the morning session.Jaiswal came out all guns blazing, collecting boundaries with cuts, drives and backfoot punches. A couple of straight towering sixes, with great footwork, were a treat to watch. He also made the life of Kiwi bowlers difficult with sweeps and reverse sweeps.But Shubman Gill (23) and Jaiswal (77) got out in quick succession in the post-lunch session. Rohit Sharma (8) came on to the front foot and popped a bat-pad catch to short leg while Gill edged a Santner delivery angled into him to slips. Jaiswal did not use soft hands against the left-arm bowler around the wicket. While trying to cover the angle, he edged the straightened ball comfortably to first slip.Almost 30,000 spectators felt the pain when Rishabh Pant was run out for a three-ball duck. He was slow off the blocks from the non-striker's end as Kohli wanted a sharp single to backward point. And the ball was to the throwing hand of Santner, who was right on the money with the throw to the 'keeper just above the stumps.After the fall of Jaiswal at 127-3, India could have sent Washington Sundar and Jadeja to bat ahead of aggressors Pant and Sarfaraz Khan. It's not clear if they did not trust the staying capacity of the duo considering the conditions or wanted to chase down the target on the third day itself. Kohli (17) played on the backfoot when he could have played it with better control and paid the penalty of leaving it to the umpires' call against Santner's guile.The approach of rival fielding captains also indicated that the Kiwis showed more flexibility. Latham started with pace from both ends but after realizing that it was not working, he brought on Santner immediately.On the other hand, Rohit started with both off-spinners R Ashwin and Washington Sundar in the second innings, not trusting world-class pacer Jasprit Bumrah with the new ball for at least a couple of overs. And he persisted with Ashwin at the end from which Santner had taken seven wickets in the first innings despite having a leftie - Jadeja - at his disposal.",India lose second Test against New Zealand by 113 runs in Pune.

NEW DELHI: Former PCB chairman Ramiz Raja on Saturday found himself in troubled waters over his absurd questions to Pakistan captain Shan Masood on live television after the team's series triumph over England.In Rawalpindi, Pakistan thrashed England by 9 wickets in the decider to secure a superb come-from-behind 2-1 series win.However, Ramiz was seen taunting skipper Masood after the match as he, rather than talking about series win, asked the captain ""Aapne 6 losses in a row kaise achieve kiya?"" (How did you achieve six losses in a row?).Along with this, there were also a few other shots fired by Ramiz at Masood during the post-match show.Ramiz's behaviour didn't go down well with former cricketers and fans at all as he faced severe criticism for his taunts.Left-arm pacer Mohammad Amir too hit out at Ramiz for his post-match comments, saying that the former Pakistan cricketer should behave like a literate person.""You should celebrate the series win. There is a series winning captain sitting next to you. You should have asked him about the win, next plans. But you are making fun of him. Have some respect. You are literate people and you should behave like one as well. Where the credit is due, you should give it. I was feeling so bad for Shan. Ramiz has been doing on-air duties for so long now and he has no idea what to ask a winning captain,"" said Amir in a video posted on X.The Test series win was Pakistan's first on home soil since 2021. Their last triumph had come against South Africa at the start of 2021.After that they had lost series against Australia, England and Bangladesh at home while a series against New Zealand had ended in a 0-0 draw.It was also Pakistan's first series win over England since 2015.

PUNE: ""We are allowed to have two bad matches after doing so well, especially at home over the years."" This was captain Rohit Sharma summing up the defeat to New Zealand as India's formidable home-win record, stretching back more than a decade, came to an end here on Saturday.""It's necessary to be sad. But not in a bad way and do things that can harm us. We need to change our batting approach slightly, not completely,"" Rohit said. Rohit probably won't approve of the word 'self-destructive' when it comes to describing India's batting for a large part of this series. ""We first want to win the matches, not draw them. We have the ability to bat three days in a Test. But if we do that, we will win the game,"" he said.The skipper said that he didn't want to be too critical of his team and teammates and create an atmosphere in which players would start doubting their own ability. ""When we were juniors and not established players, all we wanted was support and encouragement from seniors and team management. I will keep them nice and calm and make them feel they belong here.""Describing the need to bat aggressively, he said, ""When you play around with the field and bowlers, it also allows you to play with a straight bat. We want to work on our weaknesses. But more than that, we want to work on our strengths,"" he said.Rohit conceded that India failed to respond to the pressure, and stated: ""It's too early to think about WTC .""He first has to think about the third Test in Mumbai starting on Nov 1.

Rohit probably failed to read the pitch on both occasions. He did not feel that the pitch would be so spin-friendly in Pune that both Indian pacers would be almost out of the game in the second innings.Former India coach Ravi Shastri , meanwhile, told the official broadcaster: ""India underestimated New Zealand spin. It is a rude awakening, you cannot be complacent. India were outplayed in the first two Tests. They also played into the Kiwis' hands with defensive fields.

Santner Did Exactly What Sundar Did For India | NZ Defeated India on Indian Soil | | Basit Ali

🔴 LIVE: India vs New Zealand: Another embarrassing show by India batters, series in danger

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali believes that India face an uphill task to make a comeback in the second Test against New Zealand at MCA Stadium in Pune.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Basit remarked, “Rohit Sharma aur Virat Kohli agar runs kare (If Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli score runs) — two big names who failed in the first innings—there might be a possibility (of a comeback). But the chances are very low right now. New Zealand are in a very strong position to win the match... Before the Australia tour, this is not a good sign for India. Let's see what happens.”New Zealand have taken control of the Test, leading by 301 runs at stumps on day two, thanks to a brilliant performance by left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner , who grabbed 7-53 to dismantle India's batting lineup.India were bowled out for just 156 in response to New Zealand's 259, giving the visitors a 103-run first-innings lead on a challenging Pune pitch.By the end of the day, New Zealand reached 198-5 in their second innings, with Tom Latham scoring a solid 86.Wicketkeeper Tom Blundell (30 not out) and Glenn Phillips (9 not out) remained unbeaten, steering New Zealand closer to what could be a historic Test series win in India.India’s bowlers, led by Washington Sundar , showed some resistance.Sundar picked up four wickets, bringing his match tally to 11, while Ravichandran Ashwin chipped in with a key breakthrough. However, New Zealand’s batters extended their lead, leaving India in a tough spot.India’s batting collapse in the first innings was another disappointment, following their 46 all-out debacle in Bengaluru.Ravindra Jadeja top-scored with 38, but wickets tumbled regularly. Santner’s spin exposed India's vulnerabilities, with crucial dismissals, including Virat Kohli for just one and Sarfaraz Khan for 11.With New Zealand already 1-0 up in the three-match series, Basit Ali’s doubts about India’s comeback seem justified.India's struggles with the bat are particularly concerning ahead of their upcoming Australia tour. At the moment, New Zealand appear to be firmly in control, leaving India searching for answers.","Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali believes that India face an uphill task to make a comeback in the second Test against New Zealand.

The Indian cricket board also picked the squad for the four-match T20I series against South Africa.The five-match Test series is set to commence on November 22 in Perth, with India aiming to defend the trophy. The squad features two new faces in Delhi pacer Harshit Rana and Andhra seam-bowling all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy, who received their maiden call-up to the national team.However, the selection committee opted not to include Kuldeep Yadav in the squad, as he has been advised to undergo long-term rehabilitation for his groin injury. Another notable absentee is Mohammed Shami, who is still recovering from an ankle injury sustained during the 2023 ODI World Cup. Ruturaj Gaikwad ’s absence was among the notable exclusions that sparked anger on social media, as he missed out on selection in both the Test and T20I squads.The Maharashtra batsman, who was recently appointed as the captain of the India A team for their upcoming tour of Australia, was expected to be included as a backup opener for the Border-Gavaskar series.This decision was based on the possibility of Rohit Sharma missing one of the earlier Test matches due to personal reasons.Gaikwad has been in impressive form, consistently performing well in the Duleep, Irani, and Ranji Trophy matches over the past two months.However, the selectors chose to include the in-form Bengal batsman Abhimanyu Easwaran , who has scored four centuries in his last four first-class matches across the aforementioned tournaments.Fans took to social media to express their disappointment and question the decision to exclude Gaikwad from the squad.""Politics And Favouritism Won Once Again,"" a fan wrote, while another commented, ""Can't find Ruturaj Gaikwad anywhere in both squads.""Gaikwad is currently the leading run-scorer for Maharashtra in the ongoing Ranji Trophy tournament, with 231 runs in 2 matches at an average of 77.00, including one century and one half-century.",The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the 18-member squad for the upcoming five-Test series against Australia for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

🔴 LIVE: IND vs NZ: Rohit Sharma & Co. Get Their Playing XI Right | Washington Makes Instant Impact

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant is a livewire on the field, bringing energy to the atmosphere with his thrilling shots while batting and his entertaining antics behind the wickets.In a hilarious turn of events that unfolded during the first day's play of the second Test against New Zealand in Pune, Pant was caught on the stump mic telling spinner Washington Sundar to bowl a bit fuller to Kiwi tailender Ajaz Patel ""Washi aage daal sakta you can bowl a little fuller, thoda bahar daal sakta hai,"" Pant came up with a suggestion to Sundar.Sundar seemed to have followed Pant's advice, delivering a tossed-up ball that turned out to be a bit too straight. Ajaz Patel swung through the line, and the ball flew to the right of mid-on, racing away for four runs.Patel's response to Sundar's delivery left Pant slightly disappointed, as he was overheard saying, ""Yaar mereko kya pata issey Hindi aati hai"".In the match, Sundar shone on his return to the Indian side, taking seven wickets as New Zealand was bowled out for 259. At the close of play in Pune, India stood at 16 for 1, having lost captain Rohit Sharma for a nine-ball duck to a Tim Southee delivery that shaped away and crashed into the off-stump off his pad.Yashasvi Jaiswal, with six runs, and Shubman Gill, with ten, were at the crease as the hosts trailed by 243 runs. Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra led the New Zealand batting effort, scoring 76 and 65 runs, respectively, after captain Tom Latham won the toss.Off-spinner Sundar finished with impressive figures of 7 for 59, while fellow off-break bowler Ravichandran Ashwin took 3 for 64, helping to dismiss New Zealand in just 79.1 overs.","Rishabh Pant was caught on the stump mic telling spinner Washington Sundar to bowl a bit fuller to Kiwi tailender Ajaz Patel.

Can Washington succeed Ashwin?

Chennai: October 24, 2024, will undoubtedly go down as a red-letter day in Tamil Nadu cricket history as two ‘sons of the soil’ joined forces to bag all 10 wickets for India in a Test innings .On the opening day of the second match in Pune on Thursday, the returning Washington Sundar ran through the New Zealand middle and lower-order with a personal-best seven-wicket haul after fellow off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin removed the top-three.The masterclass from Washington and Ashwin effectively made it a mini contest between TN and NZ, with the finger spinners from the southern region of the country emerging well on top in the end. The ‘brothers of destruction’ brought huge cheer to everyone associated with cricket in TN, a state that has a history of producing fine slow bowlers.“It was fantastic to see two off-spinners from TN combine to pick up all 10 wickets in an innings. Washington was a surprise element; no one would have expected him to pick up seven wickets. It is a great thing for him as well as TN cricket. When it comes to Ashwin, he has been consistently doing well and is expected to be among the wickets,” M Venkataramana , former India off-break bowler and TN head coach, told TOI.With pride swelling in his voice, M Senthilnathan, a former TN player who coaches MRF Globe Trotters SC – theTNCA first-division team which Washington plays for – said: “Washington can be a lethal weapon with the ball on turning tracks. Washington and Ashwin have shown in this Test that they can play together. The TN guys did it (10 wickets) together. They bowled NZ out.”As Ashwin is at the twilight of his glorious career, the selectors and management are busy finding an able successor for the maestro. Washington fits the bill and has made a strong case on his Test comeback.Asked if Washington can be a like-for-like replacement for Ashwin after the latter hangs up his boots, Venkataramana said: “So far, he has proved himself in white-ball cricket. In international red-ball cricket , this is the first time he has performed so well with the ball. He has to keep improving. He has to work harder to have the skills to bowl well on good batting tracks. If he does that, he will be very good in the future. His past experience in the India team will help.”Senthilnathan said that Washington has the wherewithal to operate in a spin-heavy attack. “He will be a star performer for India in the years to come. Ashwin has been doing very well. There is an option to play both of them. If Ashwin continues to play like this, why not have both of them in the XI? When we can play two left-arm spinners in the XI, why cannot we have two right-arm off-spinners in the team?”",Washington Sundar and Ravichandran Ashwin took all 10 wickets in India's innings. The 'brothers of destruction' brought huge cheer to everyone associated with cricket in Tamil Nadu.

Reserves:

Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) announced an 18-member India squad for the five-match Test series against Australia on Friday with Abhimanyu Easwaran, Harshit Rana and Nitish Rana included. The series begins in Perth on November 22.Arguably, the biggest talking point in the squad is the absence of Mohammed Shami , who had been working against the clock to get ready for the series. The match-changing seamer underwent ankle surgery earlier in the year and his rehabilitation process had appeared to be on track until a recent swelling to his knee.Kuldeep Yadav is also not in the squad to figure out a long-term solution for his chronic left groin issue. BCCI said in a statement, ""Kuldeep Yadav was unavailable for selection for the tour of Australia since he has been referred to The BCCI Centre of Excellence after the end of the ongoing Test series against New Zealand for long term resolution of his chronic left groin issue.""Mukesh Kumar, Navdeep Saini and Khaleel Ahmed have been named as the reserves.Bengal's Easwaran has been rewarded for his success in domestic cricket as he becomes the third-choice opener alongside skipper Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal.India will also travel with a well-stocked pace attack alongside the leading pair of Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj. Akash Deep has maintained his spot following impressive performances against England and Bangladesh, while Prasidh Krishna returns to the Test squad after debuting in South Africa.The Karnataka seamer underwent lengthy rehabilitation for a stress fracture. He was impressive in India A's Duleep Trophy title win last month.Seamer Harshit Rana gets to cap off an excellent year where he starred in an IPL title and now gets a Test call-up, after already being picked in the other two white-ball squads.Andhra Pradesh's medium-pace all-rounder Nitish Reddy is in the same boat as Rana, having impressed in the T20 league and stepping up to India level with his T20I bow in the Bangladesh series this month.Among the spin-bowling options, Washington Sundar, who took seven wickets in the first innings against New Zealand in the on-going second Test in Pune, has also been picked. But Axar Patel has been left out.Rohit Sharma (C), Jasprit Bumrah (VC), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant (WK), Sarfaraz Khan, Dhruv Jurel (WK), R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Prasidh Krishna, Harshit Rana, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Washington Sundar.Mukesh Kumar, Navdeep Saini, Khaleel Ahmed.","India announce 18-member squad for five-match Test series against Australia.

However, his fortunes declined during the 2017 season, and his role came under scanner due to shifting of power structure, as he revealed in his latest book. Virender Sehwag was roped in as mentor of Punjab and it was the time when Maxwell was named the side's captain. However, the duo found themselves at loggerheads with Sehwag asserting his authority and taking control of decisions, including selecting the playing XI.""When it came to selection, I thought it might be a good idea to bring the coaches into a WhatsApp group to make our decisions. Everyone agreed to this and shared their teams, with the exception of Sehwag,"" Maxwell wrote in his book, the excerpt of which was published on ESPNCricinfo.""At the end of the process, he made it clear that he would pick the starting XI, end of story. We were losing on and off the field by now, with Sehwag on more than one occasion making decisions that didn't necessarily make sense.""Maxwell revealed that his relationship with Sehwag deteriorated further after he publicly criticized him. This public criticism deepened the rift between the two, worsening their already strained dynamic.""The season came down to our final group game against Pune away from home, and we had a shocker batting first on a wet wicket, rolled for 73. It was all over. In the context of what was going on, I'm still quite proud of how we were able to broadly keep the show on the road until that stage,"" Maxwell wrote.""I was also happy with how I performed, doing the right thing as leader by giving myself the chance to influence games at the right time with bat and ball. Of course, we were all flat not to make the postseason, but it could have been so much worse.""I volunteered to do press that night, but Sehwag said he would instead. Upon getting onto the team bus, I found I'd been deleted from the main WhatsApp group. What was going on here? By the time we reached the hotel my phone was blowing up, with Sehwag having unloaded on me as a ""big disappointment"", blaming me for not taking responsibility as captain, and all the rest. It was unpleasant, especially when I thought we had parted on good terms.""""I texted him to say how much it hurt to read those comments and added that he had lost a fan in me for the way he had conducted himself.

Nagpur: Yash Rathod , in his nascent career, has shown a penchant for standing up to crises with maturity. On Saturday, the southpaw batter again posted a ton when the team was in a spot of bother to guide Vidarbha to 326 all out on Day 1 of Ranji Trophy Elite Group 'B' against Uttarakhand in Dehradun.Be it last year’s semifinal against MP or Vidarbha’s previous match against Puducherry, Rathod played the saviour role belying the be wet behind the ear stage of his 11-First Class-match-old career.Things were not much different at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Dehradun on Saturday. Opting to bat, Vidarbha, after an early flourish provided by opener Dhruv Shorey (35;43b;8x4), found themselves at 64 for 3 in 16.3 overs. Absence of veteran Karun Nair, the professional is still nursing an injury suffered in the last match, made the situation more grave.But Vidarbha had Rathod, fresh from his century knock in the previous match. Coming in at No. 5, Rathod started on a positive note with an early boundary. He found an able ally in Danish Malewar , another young home-bred batter.The two rode over the tough phase, importantly, without going into the shell. By lunch, Rathod and Malewar took Vidarbha to 127 for 3 in 35 overs apart from easing a few nerves in the visitors' dressing room.The second session saw the fourth wicket partnership putting Vidarbha in a position of strength. Malewar (56;116b;5x4) posted second fifty in his second FC match before becoming left-arm spinner’s second victim of the day.After Malewar’s dismissal, Rathod stitched another crucial partnership with skipper Akshay Wadkar . Rathod and Wadekar added 57-run for the fifth wicket as Vidarbha reached 238 for 4 by tea.The first ball of the third session saw Wadkar (25;51b;3x4) edge a Mayank Mishra delivery to wicketkeeper Aditya Tare. Undeterred by the fall of two key wickets, Rathod continued to dictate terms over rival bowlers.Rathod brought up his third FC hundred in style, through a straight driven boundary, his 13th of the innings, off medium pacer Abhay Negi. At the other end, allrounder Akshay Karnewar (24;25b;3x4;1x6) played a cameo which ended with an edge off a Deepka Dhapola delivery to wicketkeeper.Running out of partners, Rathod (135;195b;16x4) missed to connect a delivery by Avneesh Sudha at the fag end of day.BRIEF SCORESVidarbha: 326 all out in 88 overs (Yash Rathod 135, Danish Malewar 56, Dhruv Shorey 35, Akshay Wadkar 25, Akshay Karnewar 24; Mayank Mishra 3-72, Swapnil Singh 2-70, Avneesh Sudha 2-35) vs Uttarakhand.",Yash Rathod scores 135 as Vidarbha reach 326 all out on Day 1 of Ranji Trophy Elite Group 'B' against Uttarakhand in Dehradun.

MUMBAI: India's first-ever home Test series defeat to New Zealand has highlighted a new vulnerability: Indian top-order batsmen, once known for neutralising visiting spinners (with Shane Warne being a notable example), are now as susceptible to spin as any other team in the world.In the second Test in Pune, Kiwis' left arm spinner Mitchell Santner exposed India's struggles on a rank turner. Santner's 13-wicket haul led New Zealand to a 113-run win within three days.In a similar scenario seven years ago at the same MCA Stadium, Australian left-arm spinner Steve O'Keefe made a dream debut by taking 12 wickets, which powered them to a 333-run win. On that occasion, India was bowled out for 105 and 107 across two innings.Former India skipper Dilip Vengsarkar feels that one reason India's batting now collapses regularly on turning tracks is that their batsmen don't play enough domestic cricket to enhance their skills against the spinners.""Unless you play domestic cricket, you'll not master the skills of playing spinners. I'm not talking about just playing on turning tracks, but also playing spin well. This is why it's important that everyone should be available to play domestic cricket. Also, when you have these Under-19 and India A tours on, at a time when international cricket is happening, it dilutes the importance of domestic cricket,"" Vengsarkar told TOI on Saturday.Meanwhile, Vengsarkar lauded the Kiwis' for pulling off the stunning series win. ""It's an historic and a well-deserved win for the Kiwis. What's important is that they knew what's expected of them to win the series in India and they came here very well-prepared as they outclassed India.""",India lost first-ever home Test series to New Zealand.

Odisha’s perennial problem with batting came to haunt them again on Saturday as they were bundled out for 193 in 65 overs by Baroda in the opening day of their Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match in Vadodara. The home side rode off-spinner Mahesh Pithiya ’s five-wicket haul to skittle Odisha below the 200-run mark at Kotambi Stadium .At stumps, table-toppers Baroda reached 50 for the loss of one wicket in 22 overs. Opener Jyotsnil Singh (5 off 8) returned to pavilion in the second over of the match. Shivalik Sharma (28 batting) and Shashwat Rawat (17 batting) are unbeaten at the crease for the hosts who have come out victorious in both their matches so far.Odisha, on the other hand, are sixth in the eight-team group with four points after two rounds. And in the third match of the season, they are in trouble as Baroda trail them by only 143 runs going into the second day of the tie.Veteran all-rounder Biplab Samantray was the top scorer for Odisha with a gritty 132-ball 58, while wicketkeeper-batter Aasirwad Swain (37) at No. 7 saved Odisha the blushes. Odisha were reduced to 73 for five in 33.3 overs at lunch and it was because of Samantray and Swain that Odisha could breach the 150-run mark. However, Odisha lost their last four wickets for only 14 runs to finally skittle below 200. Opener Shantanu Mishra (23) was the only other Odisha batter to reach the 20s.Earlier, Junagad-born Pithiya, whose action resembles that of Team India offie Ravichandran Ashwin , was in fine form. The 22-year-old jolted Odisha’s middle and lower order with fine spells of off-spin, taking five wickets for 61 runs in his 22 overs.Pacer Akash Singh and left-arm tweaker Bhargav Bhatt took two wickets apiece while Krunal Pandya scalped one with his orthodox left-arm spin.Captain Govinda Poddar gave Odisha an early breakthrough inducing an edge off opener Jyotsnil in his first over but despite some tight bowling by his teammates the visiting side could not make any further inroads into the Baroda batting lineup.Brief Scores (In Vadodara): Odisha 193 all out in 65 overs (Biplab Samantray 58; Mahesh Pithiya 5/61).

PUNE: A New Zealand journalist performed the Haka - a traditional ceremonial dance performed with and aggressive body language and war cries - during skipper Tom Latham 's post-match press conference.Latham did not appear to have liked it. He didn't stop the man, neither did he smile. But he sighed in relief after the sequence, which included a salute to the winning team.New Zealand are that kind of team. They don't like theatrics, at least in public. They prefer to show what they are made of on the big stage.After losing the Test series in Sri Lanka, they would have been disheartened. Pacer Tim Southee resigned as captain after the defeat and Latham got the reins. Their track record in India (36 Tests, 17 defeats, two wins) was not too encouraging either. And now within a fortnight, they have won two wins, including a precious series win in India on their 14th attempt (11 loses, two draws).""We did not play too badly in Sri Lanka. They scored eight 50s but no hundred. But the results didn't go our way,"" said Latham, who had captained the Kiwis in nine games before the India tour, winning four and losing five.""We tried to analyse what went wrong."" The Lanka tour probably helped them acclimatize to subcontinent conditions. They also realized their ultra-defensive ways against Indian spinners in 2016 was incorrect. They also missed Kane Williamson , their best Test batter in recent history, due to injury.""All we try to do is improve our game,"" said Latham. ""In each part of the game and process, regardless of who is the captain.""New Zealand had beaten India in the semis of the 2019 ODI World Cup in Manchester and the 2021 WTC final in Southampton.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan off-spinner Sajid Khan hilariously poked fun at himself, saying that Allah has given him such a look that even when he laughs, people get scared.In a video that went viral on social media, Sajid was responding to a question about how he was intimidating opposing batters from one end while Noman Ali was taking wickets from the other, drawing a comparison to Pakistan's legendary pace duo, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis ""Maine toh koi daraya nahi hai yaar, aap log kehete ki dara rahe ho, ab Allah ne look aisi di hai main hasta bhi hu toh log darr jate hain,"" (I have not scared anyone, Allah has given us such a look and eyes that people get scared even if we laugh, what is my fault in this?) he said.Noman and Sajid combined to dismantle England, leading Pakistan to a commanding nine-wicket win in the decisive third Test, securing a memorable 2-1 series victory on Saturday.Pakistan had been in control after gaining a crucial first-innings lead of 77 on a pitch where spinners from both sides thrived.Noman (6-42) and Sajid (4-69) bowled England out for a meager 112 in their second innings, leaving Pakistan with just 36 runs to chase for the series win.Despite losing Saim Ayub early, Pakistan comfortably sealed the victory during an extended morning session on day three.Noman and Sajid took 19 of England's 20 wickets, with Pakistan opting not to use their lone seamer, Aamer Jamal, at all - a clear sign of the spin-friendly conditions. Since their mid-series selection, the duo claimed 39 of the 40 English wickets in the last two Tests.","Pakistan off-spinner Sajid Khan poked fun at himself in a video that went viral on social media.

Ranji Trophy: Priyank Panchal slams hundred but Rajasthan fightback to restrict Gujarat to 285/7 on Day 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ranji-trophy-priyank-panchal-slams-hundred-but-rajasthan-fightback-to-restrict-gujarat-to-285/7-on-day-1/articleshow/114628664.cms,"Brief Scores

JAIPUR: Priyank Panchal once again proved that he is one of the giants of domestic cricket by cracking a brilliant century to steer Gujarat to 285 for 7 against Rajasthan on the opening day of the Ranji Trophy Elite Group B match at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium here on Saturday.The 34-year-old opener hit 28th First-Class hundred of his career with a composed 110 to provide a solid start to his team but after his departure, Gujarat lost 4 quick wickets for just 12 runs in the post-tea session to end the day on a slightly even keel.Panchal, who not so long ago was in the selectors’ radar as a Test opener, added 156 runs with Aarya Desai for the first wicket after Rajasthan skipper Deepak Hooda won the toss and opted to field first.The left-right combination of Desai and Panchal frustrated the hosts who entered the field with four pace bowlers. They capitalised on the depleted Rajasthan bowling attack by negotiating the pacers as well as spinners without any problem to help their team go to the lunch without any loss.Even after the break, they continued their run spree, and it looked that Hooda’s decision to bowl first backfired completely.However, against the run of play and everyone thought Desai would reach his maiden hundred in his sixth Ranji match, Arafat Khan sent him back with a sharp outswinger. The right-arm pacer just moved the ball slightly away and Yash Kothari in the first slip held a splendid catch in front of his chest. Southpaw Desai looked dejected as he walked back to the pavilion. The 21-year-old hammered 86 off 119 balls laced with 15 boundaries.Arafat struck again on the next ball, sending back left-hander Manan Hingrajia with a similar delivery. This time wicketkeeper Kunal Singh Rathore took a low catch. The two quick wickets brought life to the Rajasthan players, who were desperately searching for a breakthrough since morning.Despite a double blow, Panchal was going great guns at the other end and completed his hundred with a superb square-drive boundary off Aniket Rajput. The veteran added 76 for the third wicket with Umang Kumar (41) to consolidate his team’s position.Panchal didn't last long as he became the first of the three victims of Ajay Singh Kukna. The left-arm spinner was playing the first match of the season and justified his inclusion with three crucial wickets to bring his team back into the match.At stumps, Jaymeet Patel and Arzan Nagwaswalla were batting at the crease on 26 and 4, respectively.Medium-pacer Arafat Khan and left-arm spinner Ajay Singh Kukna claimed three wickets each, while experienced left-arm seamer Aniket Choudhary took one wicket for Rajasthan.Panchal was satisfied with his knock but rued the fact that his team lost too many wickets towards the end of the play.""It was a well-crafted century. The bowling attack was good, and we had to bat cautiously in the beginning. They had four seamers who bowled well in patches. I was feeling confident from the start and knew a big innings was coming. I couldn't reach the pitch of the ball and the ball went high which caused my dismissal,"" Panchal told TOI after the day's play.He is hoping the tailenders will click tomorrow morning and add some crucial runs. “If we can add around 50-60 runs more and reach beyond the 350-run mark then it would be a strong total. I was not surprised by Rajasthan's decision to bowl first. Even we would have done the same had we won the toss,"" said Panchal.Gujarat 285/7 in 85 overs (Priyank Panchal 110, Aarya Desai 86, Umang Kumar 41, Jaymeet Patel 26 not out; Arafat Khan 3-39, Ajay Singh Kukna 3-92, Aniket Choudhary 1-46) vs Rajasthan.",Priyank Panchal hits 110 as Gujarat reach 285-7 on opening day of Ranji Trophy Elite Group B match.

BENGALURU: Nearly five years ago, Vyshak Vijaykumar stood in front of the mirror at his home and wept. The reflection he saw was not that of a top-level pace bowler, but of a plump young man whose cricketing dreams have been pegged back.Vyshak's fitness was far beyond ideal then and his action was all over the place, cutting his pace by a couple of yards.""He was nervous and unsure as he did not know what his future was. He told us that he was overweight and was not able to leap properly while bowling and he feared that his career would come to an end,"" Vijaykumar, father of Vyshak, told PTI, after his son was drafted into the India squad to tour South Africa for four T20Is.But around this time, Vyshak, now 27, got a chance to work with former India pacer and bowling coach Bharat Arun in Chennai.""It was a good opportunity for him because Arun is a very experienced coach. He helped him with his action and also to cut down his weight. He trained with him for a few weeks and came back a totally changed bowler and person,"" he said.In this period, Vyshak also received copious help from former athlete and coach BP Aiyappa and trainers Sai Prasanna and Puneeth.But Vyshak was also fortunate to get guidance from former India and Karnataka pacer Abhimanyu Mithun during his initial days with the state Ranji Trophy team during the 2021-22 season.Mithun, himself a fitness savant, was impressed by Vyshak's attitude towards the sport, and took him under his wing.""He was a very enthusiastic young bowler who wanted to learn and improve. Even then he had a lot of skills, but just had to concentrate on his fitness, so that he could play to his full potential.""Our focus was on fitness and he followed all the tips regularly which I think helped him later to get a contract with Royal Challengers Bengaluru ,"" Mithun told PTI.Vijaykumar agreed upon the point. ""Initially, Vyshak was disappointed that he could not get an IPL contract, despite having trials with Chennai Super Kings, Lucknow Super Giants and Mumbai Indians.""But then Rajat Patidar got injured and RCB drafted him in as a replacement. Then we told him that many more things will come your way, if you stay focussed on cricket and stay true to your roots,"" he added.Vyshak did precisely that.After getting selected to India for the upcoming white-ball trip to South Africa, one of the early phone calls he made was to his childhood coach, Devnath, who is now largely confined to his home owing to modest health.""Vyshak wanted his blessings and both were crying in fact. Devnath used to tell me long back: 'Nodi Vijaya, Vyshak prathibavantha hudaga. Avannanu cricket aadisi (Look Vijaya, he is a talented boy and make him play cricket at any cost.""Vijay followed the words of the experienced coach, who himself was an acclaimed player in the state's club cricket circuit.The first hint of his travel to the next level came when Vyshak received the BCCI pace bowler's contract, which his state teammate Vidwath Kaverappa is also a part of, last season.""I took his advice, but I had to leave my job at Hindustan Lever to travel with him for matches and practice.""But as Devnath once said, all our efforts have eventually paid off. Hopefully, he will get a chance to show his skills in South Africa,"" Vijay signed off.","Vyshak Vijaykumar, 27, has been drafted into the India squad to tour South Africa for four T20Is.

Silence the Bernabeu

Robert Lewandowski struck twice in three minutes as Barcelona crushed rivals Real Madrid 4-0 on Saturday, inflicting the Spanish champions' first La Liga defeat in over a year.Teenage winger Lamine Yamal and Raphinha completed the rout, while Madrid superstar Kylian Mbappe had two goals ruled out for offside on a frustrating first Clasico appearance for Los Blancos, who now trail league leaders Barcelona by six points.France captain Mbappe was consistently outwitted by the visitors' high defensive line to the chagrin of the exasperated Santiago Bernabeu crowd, whose mood darkened as Barcelona hit four second half goals.Barcelona snapped Madrid's 42-match unbeaten streak in La Liga, one game short of the Catalan giants' all-time record, adding further shine to their triumph.Hansi Flick has whipped Barcelona into shape in just a matter of months and in ending a run of four Clasico defeats, his young side made a statement victory to show how far they have come.Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti opted for more muscle in midfield by selecting Eduardo Camavinga over Luka Modric, with his team's game-plan clear -- defend in numbers and try to spring Mbappe or Vinicius with a long ball into the space behind Barcelona's high defensive line.It led to an intense but repetitive first half, with Barcelona's defence catching Madrid offside on eight occasions.Mbappe hit the side-netting and lobbed over but was offside on both occasions, while Jude Bellingham forced a superb save from Barcelona goalkeeper Inaki Pena, but it would also have been disallowed for offside.At the other end Barcelona's teenage star Yamal sent a soft effort at Andriy Lunin when put through on goal by a superb Lewandowski flick.Raphinha fired over and Lunin also saved from the Brazilian winger, but Barcelona were not playing with the fluidity they have demonstrated in recent weeks, culminating in the impressive 4-1 Champions League win over Bayern Munich on Wednesday.Mbappe thought he had broken the deadlock when he got in behind and produced a fine dinked finish over Pena, but yet again the forward was marginally offside and his celebration was cut short.Despite the feeling they were constantly menacing Barcelona, Madrid only produced one legal shot in the first half, with Vinicius dragging into the side-netting when he tried to catch Pena out at the near post.Eager for more control Flick replaced Fermin Lopez with Frenkie de Jong at half-time and Barcelona soon took the lead.Casado slipped Lewandowski through and with Madrid defender Ferland Mendy a step behind his team-mates, the Pole was onside.The 36-year-old slotted low past Lunin to silence the Bernabeu, and two minutes later he pounced again.Lewandowski headed home Alejandro Balde's cross to double Barcelona's advantage and net his 14th league goal in 11 games, continuing his stunning revival under Flick afer struggling last season.Mbappe had a second goal ruled out for offside as Madrid struggled to find a way back in and Pena kept out a low stinging effort from the former Paris Saint-Germain forward.Lewandowski spurned two golden chances to complete his hat-trick, shooting against the post from Raphinha's lay-off and then blazing over after good work by Yamal.Spain's Euro 2024 star Yamal plundered Barcelona's third by rifling home after the surging Raphinha teed him up, with Flick celebrating jubilantly in the dugout.Raphinha completed the rout with a lob over Lunin to leave the Bernabeu reeling.",Barcelona crush rivals Real Madrid 4-0 in Clasico at the Santiago Bernabeu.

MANCHESTER (England): Manchester City 's Erling Haaland scored an early goal to take the champions provisionally top of the Premier League with a 1-0 victory over lowly Southampton at Etihad Stadium on Saturday.Pep Guardiola 's team have 23 points after nine games, two ahead of Liverpool, who visit Arsenal on Sunday. Southampton are still without a win in their first season back in the top flight after a season away and sit bottom on one point.While Haaland scored a stunner in Wednesday's 5-0 Champions League thrashing of Sparta Prague, he had gone three Premier League games without a goal but ended that drought in the fifth minute on Saturday.Wrestling with defender Jan Bednarek, the 24-year-old Norwegian, a master of scoring from difficult angles, stabbed the ball into the roof of the net with a toe while falling onto his backside.Southampton had a terrific chance to level right before the break when Cameron Archer was one-on-one with keeper Ederson -- and Saints boss Russell Martin already had his hands raised in celebration -- but the forward smashed his shot against the bar.Haaland, whose 11 goals top the league scoring chart, had a flurry of near-misses in the second half, including a sitter from close range that he poked just wide and then buried his head in his hands in disbelief.The afternoon was a tale of teams heading in opposite directions, with City stretching their unbeaten streak in the Premier League to 32 games. They have not lost a league game at the Etihad since a defeat by Brentford in November 2022.Southampton have not won at City since 2004.The win for Guardiola's side was not particularly pretty.They did just enough to beat a Southampton team who were pinned back in their own half for much of the afternoon. Russell Martin's side will have to take comfort from conceding just one goal after allowing 18 in their previous eight league matches.""We're used to that when teams defend deep against us which makes it more difficult, we have to be patient,"" City midfielder Bernardo Silva said.""We had our chances to score three or four goals to make it, but (Southampton) deserve a lot of credit for what they did here today.""",Erling Haaland scores the only goal in Manchester City's 1-0 win over Southampton.

And on Saturday, in front of the bedazzled Highlanders fans in Guwahati, Ajaraie showed his indispensability to coach Juan Pedro Benali 's scheme of things with his magical touch in four of the five NEUFC goals on the day.The Moroccan scored a brace and assisted in one of Parthib Gogoi's two strikes and in the process, NEUFC climbed to the top half of the ISL table with a 5-0 win over the high-flying second-placed Jamshedpur FC at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium. The victory - their second this season - took them to the fourth spot with eight points from six games.Ajaraie, in turn, overtook FC Goa's Armando Sadiku as the top contender for this year's Golden Boot with seven goals - one of which was the wonder goal on Saturday that began the rout. Getting a pass from Buanthanglun Samte on the left in the fifth minute, a few feet outside the box, the 31-year-old centre forward chose to take the shot from the distance that magically flew over everyone, including the diving Jamshedpur custodian, into the top right corner of the goal.While Ajaraie missed a goalmouth chance from a Jithin MS cross a few minutes later and NEUFC kept growing into the match, the action took a diametric shift in the 29th minute as Jamshedpur's defensive mainstay Stephen Eze - already on a yellow for a foul on Gogoi in the 13th - was sent off with a second yellow as his feet inadvertently hit Muthu Mayakkannan's face while receiving a high cross.Jamshedpur coach Khalid Jamil was forced to change his tactic early on and the hosts pounced on the opportunity to up the ante in the Jamshedpur half. And it paid off just a minute before half-time as Ajaraie sent a perfect through to Gogoi from inside the box that the youngster converted with a confident touch that grazed past Albino Gomes into the net.After the change of ends, it seemed just a matter of time before NEUFC increased their lead. It came in the 55th minute and golden boy Ajaraie was involved this time with his defence piercing long through for Jithin inside the box, who did well to control it in the midst of the defenders and fed it to Gogoi near the goal who slotted it home for his 10th ISL goal - the most among U22 players in the league.The fourth goal came from a swerving finish by 20-year-old sub Louis Macarton Nickson with an assist from co-substitute Hamza Regragui.And while he saw an earlier attempt hit the woodwork, Ajaraie was undaunted in his constant attacks and produced another magical run from a Michel Zabaco pass on a counter-attack in the 90th minute and added the fifth to the NEUFC tally converting it with a defender close on heels and past the reach of the outstretched Gomes.",Alaeddine Ajaraie scored a brace and assisted in one of Parthib Gogoi's two strikes in NorthEast United's 5-0 win over Jamshedpur FC.

East Bengal FC managed to halt their 8-match losing streak across tournaments when they rallied to hold Paro FC 2-2 in their AFC Challenge League opener in Thimphu on Saturday.Facing cold weather and playing on an artificial pitch at the Changlimithang Stadium, East Bengal took the lead in the fifth minute when Madih Talal - set up by Saul Crespo - came up with a composed finish. But Paro came back immediately into the contest thanks to their two Ghanaian attackers. Evans Asante first drew a foul from East Bengal full-back Provat Lakra inside the box and his teammate William Opoku - who had once plied his trade for Bhawanipore FC in Kolkata - converted the resultant penalty.And things became worse for East Bengal who finished the first half trailing. After surviving an onslaught, the Bhutan champions launched into a quick counter-attack and Asante raced forward with the ball, sprinting past a hapless Talal and with defender Lalchugnunga nowhere to challenge him, he calmly drilled the ball in past goalkeeper Prabhsukhan Gill, who came out of his position to close the gap but in vain.Dimitri Diamantakos eventually salvaged a point for Oscar Bruzon’s side when he tapped home a deft lay-off from Nandhakumar Sekar in the 70th minute.East Bengal kept the pressure on and missed several chances to clinch the win. Diamantakos could have also killed the contest with a stoppage-time winner but the Greek striker failed to go past Paro goalkeeper Milos Cupic in a one-on-one situation.The draw might have ended a wretched run for the red-and-gold team, which has lost six matches in a row in the ISL season and two more before the start of the domestic league. But the players' inability to live up to expectations against a Bhutanese side should leave a lot to be desired for the team management.","East Bengal FC held 2-2 by Bhutanese side Paro FC in their AFC Challenge League opener in Thimphu on Saturday.

Kochi: Kerala Blasters paid a heavy price for two goof-ups, one by Pritam Kotal in the first half and then by goalkeeper Som Kumar in the second, as they went down to arch-rivals Bengaluru FC 1-3, despite dominating most of their fixture at the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium on Friday night.Second-half substitute Edgar Mendez scored twice for BFC in the 74th and 94th minutes after Pereyra Diaz gave them an early lead in the eighth minute. Jesus Jimenez Nunez (45+2) scored Blasters’ lone goal from a penalty.Former Blasters player Pereyra Diaz, who doesn’t enjoy a good relationship with the Blasters fans, continued to haunt the home side as he put BFC ahead before the match settled down. Capitalising on a Pritam Kotal mistake, Diaz won the ball from the Blasters centre-back and outfoxed Blasters goalkeeper Som Kumar with a delightful chip.After conceding, Blasters came out all guns blazing, and the remaining 37 minutes of the first half saw complete domination by the home side. They nearly equalised in the 11th minute, but Jesus’ stunning long-range shot from outside the box rebounded after hitting the top post. Two minutes later, Vibin Mohanan attempted a similar shot from the edge of the box, but this time the ball went over the bar.In the 29th minute, Blasters were awarded a free kick in the ‘D’ area after Rahul Bheke was caught handling the ball at the edge of the box. However, Luna's direct free kick missed the goal by inches. Though it seemed that Bheke deserved a yellow card for his foul, Referee Tejas Nagvenkar thought otherwise.That decision was crucial as Bheke entered the books in the 44th minute for a late challenge on Kwame Peprah inside the box. The foul resulted in a penalty, and Jesus converted it to put Blasters on level terms. It was also the first goal conceded by BFC in the last six matches.A silly error from Blasters’ 19-year-old goalkeeper Som Kumar saw BFC regain the lead in the 74th minute. Som Kumar came off his line to clear a free kick that came in for Alberto Ripoll . However, he failed to complete the catch and fumbled the ball as second-half substitute Edgar Mendez smashed the ball into the back of the net.With Blasters throwing more men forward in a desperate attempt to find an equaliser, BFC took advantage and put the game beyond their grasp in the 94th minute. Pritam Kotal once again gave away the ball to Mohammed Salah, who found Mendez all alone at the half-line. Receiving the ball, Mendez dribbled past Som Kumar, who came off his line, and shot the ball into an empty net.With this win, BFC extended their lead at the top of the points table and have 16 points from six matches, while Blasters remain in the sixth position with eight points.","Kerala Blasters paid a heavy price for two goof-ups, one by Pritam Kotal in the first half and then by goalkeeper Som Kumar in the second. Jesus Jimenez Nunez scored Blasters’ lone goal from a penalty. Second-half substitute Edgar Mendez scored twice for BFC in the 74th and 94th minutes after Pereyra Diaz gave them an early lead.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114606989,imgsize-62816,width-400,resizemode-4/114606989.jpg"

My fighting spirit helped me win my first ITF title: Tanisha Kashyap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/my-fighting-spirit-helped-me-win-my-first-itf-title-tanisha-kashyap/articleshow/114554193.cms,"Tanisha Kashyap in action during the $15,000 ITF women's tennis event in Bengaluru last week.

For Tanisha Kashyap , 22, the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week will remain special for many reasons, not least because it's her first one on the pro circuit.""This one's really special because it's in my home country, in India, and it's something that I've waited for a while,"" Tanisha said.""I'm really glad how I performed in the week I was actually injured. I had a neck catch which led to my shoulders because of the continuous matches that I played.""And it was tough each and every match to play with that pain, but I managed it really well. Mentally, I stayed strong and I relied on my fitness to win this title.""Tanisha, world ranked 868, overcame Akanksha Nitture 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-1 in the final of the hard court event.The triumph was made all the more memorable by the difficult start to the season wherein she was rendered out of action for three months after undergoing a ""mini surgery"" to treat a meniscus and ACL tear.Tanisha suffered the injury during an event in Monastir, Tunisia, in early April. She was leading in the second set against Finland'sAnastasia Kulikova , a former top-200 player with nine pro titles, when she felt pain but played through it. It was only the following day when she underwent scan, she discovered the full extent of the injury.""I cannot disclose what treatment I got, because I was treated by (Daniil) Medvedev's doctor … (I was) set back for three to four weeks,"" she said.""I was completely off from tennis. I was on crutches. I didn't play for three-four (sic) months. I was just building back my fitness and building the strength of my knee and everything.""So I would say this year has been tough, mentally, physically, and I had to face a lot adversities in the beginning because it was not looking that great.""But through it all, I stayed positive and didn't lose sight of my goal. I worked hard each and every day to build myself back up from injury … to get to where I'm right now, to lift my first pro title.""The time away from action and the subsequent comeback helped her understand her game better.""When I did start, it was also very tough, because when you start to play tournaments, you're trying to figure it out again because there's some pain or there's a certain movement that's bothering you.""So you have to find out, you have to go back and do therapy. It was a process to figure it out and to also strengthen my quads back up to support my knee. So, it was tough.""But, sometimes when there's a lot of chaos, when you have a lot of time, you can really think about tennis from an outside perspective, and you get to know yourself better.""Tunisia seems to be Tanisha's favourite hunting ground, at least this year, and it was for a reason.""The best probable reason why I frequently played in Monastir (is) because I've been boarding in All In Tennis Academy (in France), and it's very close,"" she said.""It's not that expensive to travel, not much of jet lag. And the level of the tournaments in Monastir are way, way, much higher than other places.""And I was still fresh off an injury. If you're injured and suddenly go to Thailand, what do you do? You go to Indonesia, you spend all that money for two weeks and you might not perform well.""It was in Monastir while she was finding her way back in July that she first felt a catch in the neck, which forced her to retire from a $15K event in the second round when she was leading 6-2, 4-1 against Spaniard Victoria Gomez O'Hayon.It was the same issue that cropped up in Bengaluru at the very start of the tournament, and she showed tremendous grit to play through the pain and obvious discomfort it put her in.""Right before my first round, in a certain movement, I jerked it, and I had the same neck catch again,"" she said.""I couldn't look up, I couldn't look to my right, I couldn't serve. And I think throughout this tournament, I had so many double faults. I'm sure the statistics are there.""It taught me something. I stayed strong, I battled each and every point. I ran for each and every shot. I didn't, you know, let anything go. So, that fighting spirit really helped me win this tournament.""And, of course, some strategy here and there, and to play smart tennis.""Smart tennis she did have to play in the final which lasted two hours and 19 minutes.""I knew that I had limited range of motion, and I knew that I couldn't blast my first serves, how I was blasting in Mysuru or before. So I knew that I had to tennis wise, play smart, and place the ball and start off the point and stay in the rallies for my match.""For sure, the neck started to act during the first set, which lasted more than an hour and a half. She delivered nine double faults in the opener, compared to just one for the remainder of the match.""When I was four or five down, my neck started to really catch again, and it was really extremely painful. So I had no other option to call the physio,"" Tanisha said.""The second and third, I took a breather. I just kind of meditated and focused on my game strategy … to place the balls away from her striking zone and to make her work for each and every point.And maybe she wasn't expecting, maybe she thought that I would be tired out and I wouldn't fight back. But I've always been a fighter, and I stayed strong mentally and just stayed in it, and I let her make the errors.""I was calm and cool. I can't explain it, but you know, I just went into my zone.""Tanisha has been mainly coached by her father Suresh Kalita. But she had worked with former Davis Cupper Vishaal Uppal and Billie Jean King Cup player Rushmi Chakravarthi among other coaches. She also had a short stint at the JC Ferrero Tennis Academy in Spain before heading to the Ohio State University to play college tennis.Having seen her share of tennis abroad, the Assam native believes that while the ""commitment level and fitness level"" were the areas where Indian players lagged, it was not necessary that they had to relocate to elsewhere to make the breakthrough.""We can definitely do that here as well. Like I said, it depends on the individual and how much they want to do it.""They might be doing the same exercises that the Europeans are doing, but it's not up to the standard that the Europeans are doing. In the sense, the effort, the physical ability, how much you are pushing yourself.""I've always believed that it's an individual's choice. And, there are some great tennis coaches, fitness coaches here. But in the end of the day, it's how hard you push yourself.""As for herself, Tanisha is not ready to rest on her Bengaluru laurels.""""This is just the beginning of something,"" she said, ""it's a good achievement, but I'm looking for more. I'm gonna get back to train and recover, to win some more, hopefully soon.""It's just one of the small stepping stones towards the bigger picture and the bigger goal.""","Tanisha Kashyap, 22, won the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week.
