Why Indira didn’t let Rajiv attend two proposed meetings with Bhindranwale,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-indira-didnt-let-rajiv-attend-two-proposed-meetings-with-bhindranwale/articleshow/124278925.cms,"Indira Gandhi

NEW DELHI: The year 1984 is a defining moment in Sikh history but could events have taken a different course? A new book suggests there were windows of opportunity to control militant preacher Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, but these were squandered because “politics and politicians came in the way of conflict resolution”.In the months leading up to Operation Blue Star , then PM Indira Gandhi wanted her son Rajiv to secretly meet and negotiate with Bhindranwale. Two meetings were even set up by then Congress MP Amarinder Singh between 1982-84 but they never materialised because Indira was worried that her son’s life might be in danger.The last-minute cancellation of the meetings infuriated Bhindranwale, who later moved into the Golden Temple in Amritsar, setting the stage for Operation Blue Star, Gandhi’s assassination and the 1984 riots, making the year among the bloodiest in India’s political history.“I set up the meeting twice. The first time [in 1982], I picked up Rajiv and we drove to the Safdarjung airport where a special aircraft was to fly us to the Ambala Air Force station, where Bhindranwale was already waiting for us. We were recalled before we could reach the airstrip. I had to make up a story and told Bhindranwale that we couldn’t make it because the plane had developed a technical snag,” Singh says in an interview to journalist Harinder Baweja in her book ‘They Will Shoot You, Madam: My Life Through Conflict’.The book says, “Within a fortnight, Amarinder picked up Rajiv Gandhi again. They were to, once again, go to the Ambala Air Force station where Bhindranwale had already reached. This time, Amarinder was sure they would make it for the meeting. They were airborne, and on their way, but the pilot got a radio message asking him to return.”According to Singh, the second meeting was aborted because Gandhi had been told by then Punjab CM Darbara Singh that there were plans to ambush Rajiv. He claims Rajiv shared this with him. The book says, “Amarinder also suspects that Darbara Singh, who had favoured Bhindranwale’s arrest, wanted to get back to his bête noire, Zail Singh and that he was the one who told Mrs Gandhi to not let her son walk into the trap.”Another lost opportunity was in 1981. Bhindranwale was arrested for the murder of Punjab Kesari editor Lala Jagat Narain, but released within weeks after home minister Zail Singh told Parliament there was no evidence against him. “Once free, Bhindranwale went to Delhi to celebrate. He was accompanied by close to a hundred supporters who openly brandished their weapons.Home Minister Zail Singh made no attempt to rearrest him; nor did Prime Minister Indira Gandhi,” writes Baweja. “The seniormost politicians of the country catapulted Bhindranwale into a hero. The genie was now out of the bottle.”",A new book suggests there were windows of opportunity to control militant preacher Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.

Cody Bellinger’s Free Agency Decision

Pete Alonso Enters the Market

Implications for MLB and New York

The 2025 MLB offseason is shaping up to be one of the most exciting in recent memory, particularly for fans in New York. Two of the city’s biggest stars - Cody Bellinger of the New York Yankees and Pete Alonso of the Mets - are both expected to hit the open market. With MVP résumés, strong recent seasons, and major contract decisions looming, the coming months could define the direction of New York baseball and the broader league landscape.Cody Bellinger, who joined the New York Yankees after signing a three-year, $80 million deal with the Cubs, has reestablished himself as a premier offensive and defensive force. In 2025, he delivered a strong season, slashing .272/.334/.480 while adding 29 home runs and 97 RBIs. His versatility in the outfield and improved consistency at the plate have made him one of the New York Yankees’ most valuable contributors alongside Aaron Judge.However, Cody Bellinger’s contract includes an opt-out clause, and all signs point toward him exercising it. League insiders believe he is aiming for a much larger deal this winter, with projections suggesting he could command upwards of $180 million.While Bellinger has expressed interest in staying with the New York Yankees due to their championship aspirations, his free agency will likely generate heavy competition. The Yankees’ front office faces the challenge of balancing their already massive payroll, which ranks among the top three in baseball, with the need to retain a player who has become central to their offensive attack.Meanwhile, Pete Alonso - the Mets’ beloved “Polar Bear” - has officially opted out of the final year of his two-year, $54 million deal. The first baseman is coming off another powerful season, smashing 38 home runs, driving in 126 RBIs (the second-highest total in the National League), and posting a .272 batting average with an .871 OPS. Beyond the numbers, Alonso’s improved Statcast data, including his exit velocity and hard-hit rate, underline his continued dominance as one of the game’s premier power hitters.Alonso also enters free agency without draft-pick compensation attached, boosting his appeal to prospective suitors. His offensive production and status as a fan-favorite cornerstone make him one of the most coveted players available. A long-term, high-value contract is all but guaranteed, and while the Mets will undoubtedly attempt to re-sign him, the competition for his services is expected to be fierce.The simultaneous free agency of Cody Bellinger and Alonso sets the stage for one of the most compelling offseasons in years. For the New York Yankees, the priority lies in keeping Bellinger to ensure their lineup remains among the league’s most potent, especially after missing out on big-name targets last offseason. His presence alongside Judge gives New York a formidable middle order, but the financial weight of a new deal may complicate negotiations.For the Mets, Alonso’s decision forces the franchise to confront tough questions about its future core. Losing their most consistent power threat would create a major void, not just on the field but also in terms of fan engagement. At the same time, Alonso’s free agency will drive up the market for first basemen, influencing other clubs’ plans and adding further intrigue to the winter ahead.As the curtain falls on the 2025 MLB season, attention shifts squarely to a free agency period defined by two stars: Cody Bellinger and Pete Alonso. Both are opting out of their current contracts in pursuit of long-term, high-value deals, and their decisions will reverberate throughout the league. For fans in New York, this offseason carries heightened stakes, as the futures of two franchise-defining players hang in the balance.Also read: MLB Trade Rumors: Toronto Blue Jays All-Star Shortstop Predicted to Land $180 Million Contract With bidding wars on the horizon and teams eager to land elite talent, the stage is set for a dramatic and high-stakes winter.

Despite McDavid's potential for a record-setting salary, the Oilers face significant cap challenges due to existing high-value contracts. McDavid prioritizes winning a Stanley Cup, suggesting he might accept less to ensure a competitive team, forcing Edmonton to find creative financial solutions.

Frank Seravalli weighs in on Connor McDavid’s future after Kirill Kaprizov’s $136M deal

Connor McDavid’s goal: The best team around him with a genuine chance to win

Level of concern with McDavid potentially leaving?

Connor McDavid’s dilemma is to win now or cap later

Connor McDavid’s future with the Edmonton Oilers has once again taken center stage in NHL contract discussions. After Minnesota Wild forward Kirill Kaprizov secured an eight-year, $136 million extension this week, the attention immediately shifted to what Edmonton’s superstar captain might demand when his next deal comes up. The Oilers are already weighed down by big-money contracts that could limit how far they can go for McDavid.While McDavid is expected to set the market whenever he signs, Edmonton’s financial structure complicates the picture. The Oilers are currently locked into expensive long-term commitments. Leon Draisaitl’s $14 million salary, Evan Bouchard’s double-digit deal, and Darnell Nurse’s $9.25 million contract already consume a large portion of the cap. On top of that, goaltender Stuart Skinner is due for a significant raise in the near future.NHL insider Frank Seravalli highlighted this challenge, stating, ""They can't, I don't think the Edmonton Oilers can afford to go more. In fact, I don't think on their cap that they can really even afford to go 17 million, um, because of all the other deals that they've got."" That kind of financial squeeze makes it difficult for the Oilers to entertain numbers north of $17 million annually — a figure that insiders believe McDavid could command.Even with the NHL’s salary cap set to climb in the coming seasons, Edmonton’s roster construction leaves little margin to maneuver.Oilers GM Stan Bowman addressed Connor McDavid’s contract situation on Wednesday, admitting there is still no clarity on whether the superstar captain will have a new deal before the regular season begins. Bowman revealed via TSN that ongoing talks with McDavid’s agent Judd Moldaver remain frequent but offered no firm timeline, stressing, “I don’t like to make predictions, we’ll see where it goes.”Beyond the financial puzzle, McDavid’s decision may come down to competitiveness. The Oilers have enjoyed success over the past two years, but McDavid understands that aging players, a thin prospect pipeline, and limited draft picks can quickly derail momentum.For McDavid, the question is not simply “how much” but “how far can this team go?” He has made it clear throughout his career that chasing a Stanley Cup defines his priorities. That means Edmonton must strike a balance — paying its franchise player while still building the depth required to compete against the league’s best.Kaprizov’s blockbuster contract raised expectations league-wide, but McDavid’s case is different. He may ultimately accept less than his maximum value if it ensures the Oilers remain contenders. At the same time, Edmonton must find creative ways to manage the salary cap or risk losing the most dominant player in the game.McDavid’s decision will shape not just the Oilers’ future, but also the landscape of the NHL. His contract situation is now one of the defining storylines of the league.Also Read: Leon Draisaitl’s wife Celeste Desjardins just can’t stop reliving her dream wedding; Labels it “Happiest day of our lives”",Connor McDavid's contract future with the Edmonton Oilers is under intense scrutiny following Kirill Kaprizov's massive deal.

Who is Meg Moroney, Nick Bosa’s rumored girlfriend?



Nick Bosa’s absence looms large for 49ers



The San Francisco 49ers are facing a tough road ahead after Nick Bosa tore his ACL against the Arizona Cardinals on September 21. Losing the star pass rusher is a massive blow for the team, but off the field, speculation about his rumored relationship with rising country music star Meg Moroney has fans talking almost as much as his injury. 'Moroney, also 27, grew up in Douglasville, Georgia, before studying at the University of Georgia. Initially on track for a career in accounting, she shifted her focus to marketing and music business, setting the stage for her rise in the industry. She first gained attention after performing “Strawberry Wine” at a campus event, and her career took off after moving to Tennessee in 2020.She skyrocketed to fame when her single Tennessee Orange went viral in 2022, telling the story of a Georgia girl wearing her rival’s colors for love. The hit was followed by her debut album Lucky in 2023 and Am I Okay? in 2024, which debuted inside the Billboard 200’s Top 10.Adding to her profile, Moroney has previously been linked to fellow country star Morgan Wallen, though she clarified they were never officially a couple. Today, it’s her rumored connection with Bosa that has everyone’s attention. If true, she could soon join a 49ers WAG circle that already includes Olivia Culpo, who is married to Christian McCaffrey.For now, Bosa’s absence on the field is what weighs most heavily on San Francisco. But off the field, his rumored romance with Moroney adds a touch of intrigue to an otherwise difficult season.Bosa, 27, was off to a strong start this season with two sacks already under his belt. His absence will be felt immediately, especially with the 49ers heading into a Thursday Night Football clash with the Los Angeles Rams. The timing of his injury coincided with Moroney’s appearance at Levi’s Stadium, where she was spotted in a suite wearing a custom 49ers jersey and hat, fueling rumors of a budding romance.The defensive lineman is no stranger to the spotlight beyond football. Over the summer, he was seen enjoying a Grateful Dead concert with teammate George Kittle in Las Vegas, hinting at his love for music. That makes his rumored connection with Moroney, who has quickly become one of country music’s brightest young stars, even more intriguing.Also Read: Who is Jake Tonges?

Tom Brady’s NFL broadcasting role under fire



Can Brady turn it around at Fox Sports?



Seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady has built a career defined by precision and dominance on the field. Now in the Fox Sports booth alongside Kevin Burkhardt, Brady is facing a challenge of a different kind: winning over viewers. Despite his 10-year, $375 million deal, his transition from quarterback to broadcaster hasn’t been smooth.While Brady remains a part of the Las Vegas Raiders’ ownership group, his role at Fox Sports has stirred controversy. Legendary broadcaster Dan Le Batard recently voiced strong criticism, saying Brady’s presence is actually hurting the viewing experience.“Tom Brady is distracting me during games because he’s still bad at this,” Le Batard said during The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz. He added that Brady isn’t even blending in as an average analyst but instead stands out for the wrong reasons.“Like it’s not even that he’s neutral or mediocre or milquetoast or just there, and I don’t notice it. I’m noticing, and he’s distracting me with it not being good.""Le Batard compared Brady’s lack of memorable commentary to Tony Romo’s early days with CBS, where Romo impressed audiences by predicting plays with accuracy.“Is there anything memorable that Tom Brady is giving the Fox broadcast for that $375 million guaranteed dollars… that would indicate he has improved at this to you?” Le Batard asked his co-hosts.His critique struck a nerve with fans who expected Brady’s legendary football IQ to elevate Fox’s No. 1 NFL broadcast team. Instead, viewers have noticed his inexperience. Even Greg Olsen, who was bumped to the network’s No. 2 analyst role to make way for Brady, has been praised for steadier, more insightful coverage.Despite criticism, Fox Sports seems unlikely to move away from Brady. The network invested heavily in his star power, banking on his name to attract viewers and advertisers. One fellow announcer suggested that sponsorship potential is the real reason Brady was given the top spot. Yet, as Le Batard bluntly put it, “I’m noticing when he’s doing things incorrectly. I’m not noticing when he’s doing them correctly.”For now, Brady has time to refine his broadcasting voice. With patience, guidance from peers like Olsen, and lessons from polished analysts such as Romo, he could still grow into the role. But until then, Fox faces a tough reality: its biggest investment is still trying to find his rhythm off the field.Also Read: Tyreek Hill sends emotional hospital plea to brands days after devastating season-ending injury","Legendary broadcaster Dan Le Batard says Tom Brady's presence is actually hurting the viewing experience.

How Sergio Conceicao Might Transform Al Ittihad: 5 Key Changes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/saudi-football/news/how-sergio-conceicao-might-transform-al-ittihad-5-key-changes/articleshow/124278197.cms,"Sergio Conceicao (Image Source: Getty)

A shift to compact 4-4-2 with coordinated pressing

Faster vertical transitions and wide overloads

Stronger defensive structure with tighter spacing

Merit-based selection and role clarity

Targeted recruitment aligned to the playing system

Al Ittihad are once more facing a choice. Following the separation from Laurent Blanc, the Jeddah giants are reportedly on the verge of appointing Sérgio Conceição, the passionate Portuguese coach who has built his career at Al Ittihad. Not only due to his energetic and strict attitude on the sidelines, but also his general no-nonsense handling of the squad, Conceição may well bring a completely new flavour to the Saudi Pro League. Below are five main changes that could outline his period if he were to take the helm.Porto's squad under Conceição was a thoroughly trained 4-4-2 system with a narrow tactical approach. Those were not simply about the shape of the players on the pitch but also about their reaction to the pressure and their discipline.For Al Ittihad, it would signify going beyond defensive passive blocks and implementing a system where two attackers direct the pressing, driving opponents to the flanks and removing access to the middle of the pitch. Such closeness would facilitate the defenders in fending off the attacks, while, at the same time, it would require every outfield player to have a high level of stamina.Conceição likes his teams to go forward with quick and targeted moves after they regain possession.So Al Ittihad’s wide players and full-backs should be able to link up at great speeds along the sides of the pitch, thus generating overloads to stretch the opposition’s defensive line.Conversely, the team would focus more on direct vertical play, early crosses, and quick attacking transitions instead of the usual patient buildup. In the Saudi Pro League, where matches are often decided in transition phases, Al Ittihad could gain a crucial advantage over its rivals.Also Read: Sergio Conceicao Set to Take Charge as Al Ittihad’s New Manager A defence-first approach has always been a significant part of Conceição's coaching style. While at Porto, his teams were consistently among the best clubs in Europe, allowing very few goals. If he implemented the same tactics at Al Ittihad, it would result in defenders and midfielders being positioned closer together, more cover for the defence, and higher vigilance against rest-defence to avoid quick counterattacks.One of the major changes in the culture that Conceição might cause is the ruthless method of selection. He is said to choose players solely on their current form, hard work, and tactical discipline without considering their reputation. Even star players will have to acclimate to his requirements or face the possibility of sitting out. This could lead to a tighter rivalry among the team members and even help them know their characters well. This type of behavior most times leads to better team spirit and higher collective standards.Although Al Ittihad already boasts several big-name players, Conceição will likely seek new signings that better fit his style. So the team may include speedsters that are good at defense, athletic full-backs that can go up the field endlessly, and midfielders that not only press hard but also pass forward quickly. Rather than a complete overhaul, player acquisition with his mentorship might be more precise, allowing the club to seamlessly function in the system by tapping into its areas of strength.",Sergio Conceição is reportedly on the verge of taking charge of Al Ittihad.

Saudi football has gone through a managerial renaissance. Two of Portugal's most famous coaches, Jorge Jesus and Sérgio Conceição, are not only the present but also the future of Saudi football. Jesus is on his way back to Saudi Arabia to be the head coach at Al-Nassr. Meanwhile, Conceição has been appointed at Al-Ittihad. Both are seasoned professionals who have made their names in Europe, and Saudi clubs regard them as icons of ambition. However, their football tactics differ significantly. To understand each coach's preferences, let's compare their training methods.Jorge Jesus always has a tendency to structure and provide a tactical unity that is usually materialized by patience in possession and the appearance of decisive moments. Throughout his career in Portugal, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia, he has always been drawn to the idea of teams that are balanced and can turn the tide of the game by their tactical adaptability.One of his first decisions at Al-Nassr explains this style well, as he chose to reduce Cristiano Ronaldo’s participation to 75 percent of matches. This shows his sense of managing top players who need rest, and at the same time, providing a high level of performance throughout the season.He went on to say that he left Ronaldo out of an AFC Champions League match because he was confident enough in the team and tactically balanced.Jesus designs his squads to be not only defensively solid but also well-drilled in transitional play. His approach aims to blend the brilliance of superstars like Ronaldo and João Félix with the stability of an organized system. The competitive nature of football in Saudi Arabia suits his strategy, allowing Al-Nassr to maintain a strong identity, balance multiple competitions, and reduce the burden on individual players.Also Read: Sergio Conceicao Set to Take Charge as Al Ittihad’s New Manager Sérgio Conceição, on the other hand, is typically described as someone with an outraged and reactive approach. At Porto and other European clubs, he used to play fast breaks, persistent pressing, and tactical changes that were made to break the opponent’s game.Conceição often set up his team with a 4-3-2-1 lineup and changed it to 4-4-2 at times to dominate midfield areas and get rapid attacking chances. His players had to work very hard during their time out of possession, hustle opponents in a brief time, and administer a strike when the ball was given to them. His daring personnel moves have earned him the reputation of being a man who puts tactics above the stats.Conceição might as well install an aggressive and risk-taking Alfa type that would challenge possession-oriented teams, place pressing traps, and seek to unsettle rivals with his pace and fury had he been hired by Al-Ittihad.","Saudi football has gone through a managerial renaissance.

Tyreek Hill pitches comeback journey to brands while sharing hopeful update

Tyreek Hill

What the Dolphins lose without Tyreek Hill and what comes next

Tyreek Hill’s 2025 campaign ended far sooner than anyone expected, but the Miami Dolphins star isn’t letting a devastating injury stop his momentum. Just days after undergoing surgery on a torn ACL and multiple ligament damages suffered in Week 4 against the New York Jets, Hill has already shifted his focus toward recovery and business.From his hospital bed, the wide receiver took to Instagram to turn a difficult moment into a chance for collaboration. “Let’s see how many brands want to work with me during my comeback journey?” Hill wrote, signaling that his rehabilitation will not only be about football but also about building partnerships during his recovery process.Despite the severity of his injury, Hill offered fans reassurance with another message: “Surgery went great 🙏🏿.” He also quoted Romans 8:18, showing gratitude for the support pouring in from across the league. The response highlighted what many already know about Hill—his determination to bounce back and keep pushing forward.Hill’s injury came during a third-quarter play against the Jets, when his knee bent awkwardly after being tackled near the sideline. He had to be carted off the field, waving to fans despite being in visible pain.Before the setback, Hill had notched 15 catches for 198 yards and one touchdown in 2025, averaging an impressive 13.2 yards per reception.With their superstar sidelined, the Dolphins are turning to Jaylen Waddle as the new WR1. The team also signed Cedrick Wilson Jr. and will look to Malik Washington and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine to absorb additional targets.Agent Drew Rosenhaus remains confident about Hill’s future, telling ESPN: “The surgery went well. It’s about rehab, and he will play next season. The realistic goal is the start of the season.”Also Read: What led former Dolphins star Xavien Howard to retire after only four games with the Colts?

Puka Nacua could shatter an NFL record with eight catches in Rams’ showdown vs. 49ers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/puka-nacua-could-shatter-an-nfl-record-with-eight-catches-in-rams-showdown-vs-49ers/articleshow/124280596.cms,"Puka Nucua (Getty Images)

From overlooked draft pick to record-breaking pace

Spotlight grows as Rams clash with a familiar NFC West rival

Puka Nacua has already gone from hidden gem to household name in just a few seasons, but tonight he has the chance to cement his place in NFL history. With eight more receptions, the Los Angeles Rams receiver will become the first player ever to record 50 catches in the first five games of a season.Puka Nacua’s rise is as improbable as it is inspiring. Selected in the fifth round of the 2023 NFL Draft after 176 players were taken before him, he entered the league with little fanfare. But the third-year receiver quickly silenced doubts. Through four games in 2025, he has already hauled in 42 passes, averaging 10.5 per game. That pace ties him with two elite names—Michael Thomas (2018) and Cooper Kupp (2022)—for the most receptions across the first four games of a season.Now, one more big performance could set him apart. “With eight catches tonight against the 49ers, Nacua will become the first player in league history to catch 50 or more passes through the first five games of a season,” Pro Football Talk noted. For a player once viewed as a depth piece, the transformation into one of the league’s most reliable targets is nothing short of remarkable.The timing of Nacua’s chase adds even more intrigue. The Rams, sitting at 3-1, will face the 49ers—also 3-1—in a primetime matchup that carries early playoff implications.With San Francisco boasting one of the league’s toughest defenses, Nacua’s ability to get open and deliver chain-moving catches could be the difference.Beyond the record, this game offers a stage for Nacua to prove he is not simply a hot start but a cornerstone for the Rams’ future. His chemistry with quarterback Matthew Stafford has been undeniable, and his consistency gives Los Angeles another offensive identity alongside its ground game.Also Read: Who is Jake Tonges?

From undrafted long shot to breakout playmaker

Why Jake Tonges is more than just a fill-in for Kittle

For years, Jake Tonges was the kind of NFL player only die-hard roster-watchers knew about. Undrafted in 2022 and bouncing between practice squads, his name rarely appeared in headlines. But now, with George Kittle sidelined and San Francisco’s receiving corps depleted, Tonges has become one of the most unexpected bright spots of the 49ers’ early season.Jake Tonges’ journey is the kind of underdog story that defines football culture. Born in Cincinnati but raised in Los Gatos, California, just an hour from San Francisco, Tonges grew up surrounded by the team he now suits up for every week. After a steady college career at Cal, he went undrafted, signing with the Chicago Bears in 2022. His rookie year was spent bouncing between the active roster and practice squad, and by 2023 he was waived and looking for another chance.That chance arrived when the 49ers brought him onto their practice squad last season. He had yet to record a catch in the NFL until this September, when he finally broke through with a touchdown against the Seahawks. That score wasn’t just symbolic—it was the difference in a 17-13 San Francisco win.Since then, Tonges has stacked productive outings: four catches for 31 yards in Week 2, two for 21 in Week 3, and most recently, his best performance yet—three receptions for 58 yards and another touchdown.The 49ers’ depth chart currently lists Tonges alongside Luke Farrell and Brayden Willis, but it’s clear who the passing game trusts. As one report put it, “when there’s a pass to be thrown to a tight end, it’s usually Tonges.” While Farrell thrives as a blocker and Willis provides rotational support, Tonges has shown he can stretch the field and make contested grabs, traits vital for a team missing its All-Pro tight end.Also Read: Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski vows ICE crackdown at 2026 Super Bowl after NFL picks Bad Bunny for halftime show What makes Tonges’ rise even more compelling is its timing.

Gisele Bündchen’s Miami boat ride with Joaquim Valente and baby River stirs buzz as Tom Brady’s yacht looms nearby,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/gisele-bndchens-miami-boat-ride-with-joaquim-valente-and-baby-river-stirs-buzz-as-tom-bradys-yacht-looms-nearby/articleshow/124280229.cms,"Gisele Bündchen was seen enjoying a calm family boat ride with her partner Joaquim Valente and baby River in Miami. The outing gained attention due to Tom Brady’s luxury yacht docked nearby, symbolizing their diverging paths. Gisele embraces a new chapter focused on family and wellness, contrasting with Brady's reflections on fatherhood and past sacrifices.

A family moment in focus while navigating new beginnings

Passing by Tom Brady’s yacht adds symbolic weight to the outing

When it comes to Miami’s glittering waterways, few outings capture public attention like Gisele Bündchen’s most recent one. The supermodel was seen enjoying a calm family boat ride with her partner, Brazilian jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente, and their baby River. Yet, what made the serene scene buzzworthy was the coincidental backdrop: Tom Brady’s luxury yacht docked nearby.Gisele Bündchen’s day on the water wasn’t about spectacle but about presence. With her blonde hair pulled back in a simple ponytail, she looked content holding baby River as Joaquim guided their sleek vessel along Miami’s canals. The calm energy between the two hinted at the strength of their bond, built on years of familiarity that blossomed from trainer-student into a committed relationship.For Gisele, this chapter is about balancing her roles as a mother and global icon while embracing a slower, wellness-driven rhythm. Since her 2022 split from Brady, she has created a new family dynamic rooted in both co-parenting and carving out her own space. Miami, with its mix of glamour and groundedness, has become her sanctuary.While their boat ride could have passed as another family Sunday, the proximity to Tom Brady’s extravagant yacht added unmissable symbolism.Brady, who has publicly reflected on his years of football and the sacrifices it demanded, recently wrote: “Reading bedtime stories and helping them with homework are not the only ways to be a great parent. And neither is winning Super Bowls or MVPs. Being a great football player didn’t make me a great dad, but how I became a great player certainly had an impact. ”Fans were quick to interpret his words as a nod to past tensions with Gisele, who had once told Elle: “I have my children, and I would like him to be more present. I’ve definitely had those conversations with him over and over again.”Also Read: “Something in me begins to heal”: Gisele Bündchen finds peace in nature and family while Tom Brady watches from a distance For onlookers, the passing boats symbolized the distance between two very different lives now.

The Philadelphia Eagles legend, who co-hosts the hit show with his brother Travis Kelce, acknowledged that some critics felt the podcast wasn’t “worthy” of a star like DiCaprio.“The thing I enjoyed the most was reading comments like, ‘Leonardo DiCaprio is so, this podcast is so beneath Leonardo DiCaprio’s talent,’” Jason said with his trademark humor. “And I’m like, I don’t disagree with you one bit.

Brock Purdy’s impact on the 49ers’ offense



The San Francisco 49ers are preparing to face the Los Angeles Rams in a crucial Thursday Night Football matchup.

He won’t be available for the game, which is a significant blow for the 49ers’ offense. Backup Mac Jones is expected to start under center, making this his first start with the team in a live game situation.Purdy’s absence shifts the responsibility to Mac Jones, who will have to manage the offense and maintain the rhythm established by the 49ers’ starting lineup. Fans should expect adjustments in play-calling and potentially a simplified game plan to accommodate the change at quarterback.Doubtful:Full Participation:G Steve Avila (Ankle) – Expected to play.TE Colby Parkinson (Shoulder) – Active.S Kamren Kinchens (Shoulder) – Active.Brock Purdy’s absence is huge not just because he’s the starter, but because of the leadership and timing he brings to the offense. Mac Jones will now have to manage the game, and the receiving corps will have to adjust with Jennings and Pearsall out. Rookie receivers or secondary targets may see more snaps, and the team will likely rely more heavily on the running game to balance the offense.49ers fans will be watching closely to see how Jones performs and whether the team can maintain momentum without their starting QB. Purdy’s return will be key for keeping the 49ers’ playoff hopes on track, but for Thursday night, all eyes are on Mac Jones and how the offense adapts to these injuries.Also read - Russell Wilson caught looking ‘disgusted’ during Jaxson Dart’s locker room speech, and fans are losing it","The San Francisco 49ers are preparing to face the Los Angeles Rams in a crucial Thursday Night Football matchup.

Debutant

Atul Kaushik

wins bronze

India’s Pranav Soorma and Dharambir Nain failed to secure a top-two finish in the men’s club throw F51 final at the ongoing World Para Athletics Championships here, ending the country’s consecutive double podium streak in the event. The duo had previously achieved a brilliant 1-2 finish at the Asian Para Games in 2023. At the Paris Paralympics last year, they swapped places, with Dharambir finishing ahead of Soorma to secure a 1-2 finish once again. Despite expectations for India to continue its dominance in the club throw event, another top-two finish eluded the athletes this time on Thursday.Dharambir, 36, finished second with a best throw of 29.71m, behind Serbia’s Aleksandar Radisic, who threw 30.36m for gold. Soorma, who was looking for his maiden para World medal, disappointed with a fifth-place finish in a nine-man final, despite producing a season best effort of 28.19m on his fifth attempt. Dharambir later said that weather gods played a part, with high humidity after rains impacting his performance. Rain lashed parts of Delhi-NCR on Thursday evening, leading to muggy conditions. The evening session at the JLN Stadium was halted for close to an hour due to showers, with the play remaining suspended till 7 pm.“I was quite confident about my chances of winning gold. The preparations and training were good. India has dominated the club throw event over the years and Soorma and I were expected to land two medals for the country. However, rain spoiled our plans. After the drizzle, the conditions became humid, and it became difficult to grip the club. My hands were moist. Still, I managed to win silver. Overall, it feels good to be among the medallists here,” said Dharambir, who faced a life-altering accident in 2012 when a misjudged dive into a canal left him paralysed from waist down at the age of 23.Soorma looked dejected with his underwhelming show. “I produced my season best (in his fifth attempt), but it wasn’t enough to win a medal. I was looking for some good throws, but they didn’t come. Not happy,” said Soorma, a cricket and roller hockey enthusiast who was just a teenager when a cement sheet fell on his head at the age of 16. It caused a severe spinal cord injury, leaving him paralysed.The club throw F51 classification is for athletes with impaired muscle power or range of movement in their trunk, legs and hands, requiring them to throw a wooden club from a seated position using only their arms and shoulders for power.On a day when other Indians in different competition classes faltered, debutant Atul Kaushik shone bright with a bronze finish in the men’s discus throw F57 event after trailing his opponents for a major part of the final. The 29-year-old Kaushik, from the outskirts of South-West Delhi, produced a best effort of 45.61m in his fifth attempt to finish third in a 10-man final.The discus throw F57 classification is for athletes with a limb deficiency or leg length difference that affects their lower limbs but leaves their trunk and upper body functional. Athletes compete from a seated position, often using a throwing frame or chair, to throw.",India's Pranav Soorma and Dharambir Nain failed to secure a top-two finish in the men’s club throw F51 final at the ongoing World Para Athletics Championships.

Ravens’ rocky opening week against Buffalo set the tone for early season struggles that are now complicated by injuries

Troy Aikman highlights how injuries and performance gaps are impacting Baltimore’s ability to compete at expected levels

Jackson’s hamstring injury adds uncertainty and forces Ravens to navigate a pivotal week against the Texans

The Baltimore Ravens entered the 2025 season with high expectations, but a 1-3 record and a string of injuries have left the team struggling to find its rhythm. Quarterback Lamar Jackson suffered a hamstring injury during last week’s 37-20 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, missing key practices midweek and Hall of Famer Troy Aikman weighed in on the challenges the team faces. With Week 5 against the Houston Texans approaching, Jackson’s availability remains uncertain, casting a shadow over the Ravens’ offensive strategy and playoff hopes.Baltimore’s season began with a narrow defeat to the Buffalo Bills, a game that exposed cracks in execution during critical moments. Subsequent matchups offered glimpses of potential, but inconsistency and injuries have prevented the team from hitting its stride. The challenges on and off the field are compounded by key players missing practice, making every matchup a test of resilience.On Thursday’s episode of NFL on ESPN, Hall of Famer Troy Aikman analyzed the Ravens’ struggles. “You know, they got off to a tough start,” Aikman said. “Obviously in Week 1 in the loss to Buffalo in a really tight game. That would have been a great way to start the year against a conference rival. Since then, they've just haven’t played real good football.”He also stressed that injuries make it harder for the team to perform consistently.Lamar Jackson missing practice Wednesday and Thursday leaves Baltimore in a precarious situation. Coaches must weigh the risk of playing their star quarterback against the necessity of maintaining offensive cohesion. Aikman noted, “But, we saw them against Detroit a couple of weeks ago before all of these injuries... And for whatever reason, they just haven’t played up to the level that you expect from them, and now with these injuries, it’s only gonna get that much tougher. ” The team’s preparation for Houston now hinges on both player health and strategic adjustments.The upcoming clash with the Texans is more than a single game—it’s a test of Baltimore’s resilience. Jackson’s uncertain status and a roster riddled with injuries put the onus on backups, coaching, and team chemistry. How the Ravens respond could determine whether the team turns early adversity into a comeback story or continues to struggle in a season already clouded by setbacks.Also read: Courtland Sutton’s wife Brea turns heads on Broncos sidelines and steals the spotlight as husband dominates Bengals in 28-3 blowout","Troy Aikman highlights how injuries and performance gaps are impacting Baltimore’s ability to compete at expected levels.

Lalit firmly believes that significant global funds or a sovereign fund would desperately want to have them as part of their investment strategy & India strategy.There have been a lot of rumours about the sale of an @IPL franchise, specifically @RCBTweets. In the past, these were denied, but it seems the owners have finally decided to take it off their balance sheet and sell it.Having won the IPL last season, with a strong fan base, the team itself, and a great management group, it could be the only franchise available as a whole,"" Lalit wrote on X.""I'm sure one of the big global funds or a sovereign fund would desperately like to acquire them.

It's our cancer.""According to Union, she was scared and even worried that she would have to raise the kids in Dwyane Wade’s absence. The Bring It On star further mentioned,""I'll speak for myself when I say that the decisions that he was making hurt me about his cancer. It felt like, 'Oh, you're trying to kill me.And I'm going to be alone raising these kids. It's a very selfish response that I had, and it caused all kinds of problems, but [so did] his need for secrecy about his cancer decisions. It just starts sowing the seeds of distrust.""After coming across the life-threatening tumor in Wade’s kidney, Gabrielle Union felt as if the NBA icon was almost near to death.

Who am I without this big life, and without this healthy body? But you also don’t understand the journey and the toll that it takes on your marriage, on your family, on your kids.”After being married for 11 long years, Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union share a daughter named Kaavia via surrogacy.
