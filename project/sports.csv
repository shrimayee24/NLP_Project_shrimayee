A legacy with something to prove returns for a third try at DCC

Emotional fallout, a strained friendship, and a quiet comeback

Dayton Bramhall's journey with the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders has been anything but easy — and her story has become one of the most emotional arcs in Season 2 of Netflix's America’s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. A third-time auditionee and daughter of longtime DCC associate choreographer Shelly Bramhall, Dayton came into the 2024 training camp with the weight of a legacy and the pressure to finally make the team. But after once again being cut, the young dancer made a decision that would redefine her identity beyond the DCC brand.Raised in McKinney, Texas, Dayton Bramhall has been immersed in the world of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders her entire life. Her mother, Shelly, was part of the DCC class of 1989 and has served as a key figure on the staff for years. That connection, however, didn’t secure Dayton a spot. “None of us want you to make this team just because you have a history,” director Kelli Finglass told her bluntly. “You need to earn to make this team. ”Despite showing improvement and passion during her audition, Bramhall struggled with memorizing choreography and keeping up with the precision and power expected at the elite level.“There’s one that just won’t stick in my body, but I’ll get it,” she said during training camp. Unfortunately, the veterans didn’t believe she was ready — and Finglass ultimately told her it would be a “disservice to have you make this team and the struggle be all year. ”While Dayton Bramhall took the cut with grace, the decision left ripples in her personal life. Her mother Shelly admitted, “That was hard because we were friends. If anything, I wasn’t hurt by her not making it, I was way more hurt by Kelli and Judy.” Despite the tension, Dayton chose to tell her mom herself, showing maturity beyond her years.Bramhall returned in 2025 for another shot — but was cut again before training camp. In a heartfelt comment on TikTok, Dayton wrote, “I did EVERYTHING they asked of me and tried my absolute best to fit their mold. I’m not wanted there and I’m hoping this takes me to where I truly belong.”Also Read: Where is Armani Latimer now?

New York Jets' Quinnen Williams and Minnesota Vikings' Andrew Van Ginkel come in at No. 87 and No. 88 on esteemed NFL list



New York Jets defensive tackle Quinnen Williams and Minnesota Vikings linebacker Andrew Van Ginkel have been recognized for their outstanding performances in the 2024 NFL season, both landing places on the NFL Top 100 list in 2025. QuinnenWilliams ranked No. 87, while Andrew Van Ginkel ranked immediately behind him at No. 88.The ballot, cast by fellow players, is one of the league's most highly regarded rankings of on-field performance, and both defenders won their spots through gritty reliability, standout statistics, and leadership on underperforming and high-functioning teams alike.The New York Jets might have experienced another forgettable 2024 campaign, going 5-12 and stretching their drought to 14 years without the playoffs, but Quinnen Williams was still one of the team's few silver linings. Even with fighting the pull of a nagging hamstring injury, the veteran defensive tackle played 16 games and put up a decent line: 37 total tackles, eight tackles for loss, six sacks, and his third straight Pro Bowl selection.Quinnen Williams' sustained greatness arrives with newfound optimism under new head coach Aaron Glenn in 2025 to finally bring competitive football to New York. A whole season healthy after dominating as the 2022 First-Team All-Pro could be the Jets' long-awaited turnaround turning point.Andrew Van Ginkel's presence helped to make Minnesota a defensive force to be reckoned with. The Vikings were second against the run (93.4 yards per game allowed) and fifth in points surrendered (19.5) in their 14-3 regular season campaign, which lasted until the NFC Wild Card Round at the hands of the Los Angeles Rams.His breakthrough gained him his initial Pro Bowl selection and a Second-Team All-Pro.

A hush has fallen over the Golden State Warriors as fans and commentators watch closely this offseason. Rumors swirl around NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo , but no clear direction has surfaced. Meanwhile, the Warriors are staying quiet, even as whispers grow louder. With superstars Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler nearing their peak years, many wonder if the Golden State Warriors will act fast or wait on what could be a game-changing opportunity.On July 6, NBA insider Ramona Shelburne appeared on NBA Today to offer a key update on Giannis Antetokounmpo’s future. Shelburne said that Giannis may take until August or even September to decide if he will request a trade from the Milwaukee Bucks. She added, “I don’t think anything will be decided on his end until August, September”.At the same time, the Warriors have held steady. No major signings. No big trades. Behind closed doors, they are standing guard. With Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler still in the prime of their careers, the organization is preparing, but staying patient. If Giannis does make a move, Golden State wants to be ready with all cards in their hand.The wait is a gamble. The longer the Warriors hold off, the more likely they miss other key chances.Stephen Curry, now nearing 37, and Jimmy Butler, 35, have two or three years of peak performance left. Golden State’s front office knows this. If Giannis decides to leave the Milwaukee Bucks, Curry and Butler’s final championship run may hinge on swift action.Still, there is a risk. If the Warriors act too late, either in free agency or minor trades, the value of their draft picks and role players could disappear. In season after season, every pick and rotation player adds up.Analysts believe the Bucks' decision to waive Damian Lillard and bring in Myles Turner could influence Giannis Antetokounmpo to remain in Milwaukee. However, as Ramona Shelburne pointed out, “a decision like that usually comes later in the summer.”The Warriors’ offseason silence signals confidence, but also tension. Fans worldwide know the stakes. With every day that passes, the clock keeps ticking on what could be the biggest acquisition in NBA history all depending on one man’s choice.",Giannis Antetokounmpo’s decision timeline may delay Golden State Warriors’ next move.

The Context: Subway Series Banter Between Mitchell and Josh Hart

The Impact: Knicks Fans React and Trade Speculation

The Players’ New York Connections

Broader NBA and Fan Engagement

In the world of professional basketball, social media often serves as a lively arena for players to engage in friendly banter, showcase their personalities, and connect with fans beyond the court. Recently,sparked excitement among New York Knicks supporters by sending a succinct seven-word message to a Knicks fan favorite on social media, igniting a wave of reactions and speculation.The exchange occurred amid the intense New York Subway Series baseball games between the New York Mets and the New York Yankees. Josh Hart, a prominent player for the Knicks and a Yankees supporter, tweeted his allegiance to the Yankees despite the Mets winning two out of three games in the series. Hart’s tweet emphasized that New York remains a ""Yankees city,"" a nod to the storied baseball franchise’s enduring popularity in the city. Donovan Mitchell , a lifelong Mets fan with deep family ties to the organization—his father having been a manager and hitting coach—responded to Hart’s tweet with a playful jab. Mitchell’s seven-word message read: **""Saying this down 6 is funny 😂 #LFGM""**, referencing the Mets’ commanding six-run lead during one of the games.This lighthearted social media interaction quickly caught the attention of Knicks fans, many of whom flooded the comments urging Mitchell to join their team. The prospect of Mitchell donning the Knicks’ orange and blue sparked enthusiasm, given his status as a six-time NBA All-Star and a dynamic scorer. However, despite the fan fervor, there appears to be little practical momentum for such a trade. Mitchell is thriving with the Cleveland Cavaliers, and the Knicks have firmly positioned Jalen Brunson as their franchise cornerstone.Both Mitchell and Hart share strong New York roots, though their sports loyalties differ. Hart’s connection to the Yankees is personal and historic; he was gifted a Yankees jersey in honor of his great uncle, Elston Howard, the first Black player for the franchise. Meanwhile, Mitchell’s Mets fandom is lifelong, adding a layer of authenticity to his playful taunts during the Subway Series.This episode exemplifies how NBA players use social media to engage with fans and each other in ways that transcend basketball. Mitchell’s witty seven-word tweet not only entertained followers but also highlighted the vibrant sports culture in New York, where basketball and baseball loyalties intertwine. It also underscores the camaraderie and competitive spirit among NBA stars, who often blend sports talk with personal pride and humor.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could be chasing $251,019,650 Washington Wizards superstar to form Big 3 with LeBron James and Luka Doncic In conclusion, Donovan Mitchell’s brief but pointed seven-word message to Knicks fan favorite Josh Hart on social media was more than just a playful jab—it was a reflection of sports passion, city pride, and the engaging personalities that make professional athletes beloved figures both on and off the court. While the Knicks-Metropolitan rivalry continues on the baseball diamond, Mitchell and Hart’s exchange provided a memorable moment of cross-sport banter that delighted fans and added another chapter to New York’s rich sports narrative.","Donovan Mitchell sparked excitement among New York Knicks supporters by sending a succinct seven-word message to a Knicks fan favorite on social media.

On-Court Fit

The Realities: Hype vs. Hope

The NBA offseason is always a hotbed of speculation, but few stories capture the imagination of Cleveland Cavaliers fans quite like the prospect of a reunion with Kevin Love—especially as whispers about LeBron James ’s future continue to swirl. Could the Cavaliers be on the verge of reuniting their 2016 championship core? Let’s break down the latest developments, what they mean for the Cavs, and why fans are buzzing with excitement and nostalgia.Kevin Love, a key member of the Cavaliers’ 2016 title team, recently found himself moved in a three-team trade to the Utah Jazz. But his stay in Salt Lake City may be short-lived, as the Jazz are widely expected to buy out the veteran forward, making him a free agent with the freedom to choose his next destination.- Leadership & Experience: Love’s impact goes beyond the box score. He’s a respected locker room presence, mentor, and former champion—qualities invaluable to a Cavs team with playoff aspirations.- Fan Favorite: Few players are as beloved in Cleveland as Love. His return would electrify the fanbase and bring a wave of nostalgia from the 2016 championship run.- Low Risk, High Reward: At 37, Love isn’t expected to play heavy minutes.But on a veteran minimum deal, his leadership and three-point shooting could be a strategic asset off the bench.> “His impact off the floor is amazing. Here’s a great person, advocate, coach/player and can help everyone on this team trying to make that push to be a title winner like Love was in 2016.” — Zach Shafron, local reporterNo discussion of Cavaliers reunions is complete without mentioning LeBron James . The King’s future is, as always, the subject of intense speculation. Here’s what we know:- Player Option Picked Up: LeBron has opted into his contract for the 2025–26 season, ensuring he’ll play a 23rd NBA season. However, this doesn’t guarantee he’ll remain with the Lakers, as trade rumors—especially involving the Warriors and even a Cleveland return—continue to circulate.- Cleveland Connections: While a LeBron return to the Cavs faces financial and logistical hurdles, the mere possibility has fans and analysts dreaming of a storybook reunion—especially if Love is also back in wine and gold.- Lakers and Warriors in the Mix: The Lakers are reportedly open to roster changes, and the Warriors have previously shown interest in acquiring LeBron. The Mavericks have also been mentioned as a dark-horse destination if a buyout occurs.Bringing back Love—and potentially LeBron—would instantly boost the Cavs’ credibility as contenders. Both are battle-tested veterans who know what it takes to win at the highest level.- Mentorship: Young stars like Donovan Mitchell and Evan Mobley could benefit immensely from Love’s and LeBron’s experience.- Culture: The 2016 Cavs were known for their chemistry and resilience. Reuniting key pieces could help recapture that magic.- Love: Stretch big, floor spacer, and rebounder—perfect for spot minutes and as a locker room leader.- LeBron: Even at 39, LeBron remains one of the league’s top playmakers and could elevate the Cavs to true contender status if a trade or buyout somehow materializes.While the emotional appeal is undeniable, there are practical considerations:- Love’s Role: At this stage, Love is best suited for a limited role, providing leadership and shooting off the bench.- LeBron’s Contract: LeBron’s $52.6 million salary and the Cavs’ cap situation make a trade difficult under the current CBA.- Roster Construction: The Cavs must decide whether to prioritize veteran presence or continue developing their young core.The prospect of a Kevin Love reunion in Cleveland is more than just a feel-good story—it’s a move that could provide tangible benefits for a Cavs team on the rise. As for LeBron James, the rumors may be swirling, but for now, they remain just that—rumors. Still, in an NBA landscape where anything can happen, Cavaliers fans can dare to dream of one more magical run with their championship heroes.Also read: Donovan Mitchell’s Seven-Word Tweet to Knicks Star Josh Hart Ignites New York Sports Buzz and Fan Speculation One thing is certain: the 2025 NBA offseason in Cleveland is shaping up to be as entertaining as any game on the court.","Kevin Love recently found himself moved in a three-team trade to the Utah Jazz.

What is Julio Urías doing now and how did MLB react to the whole situation regarding their star player?



Julio Urías, once considered to be a promising young player in the MLB, has his entire career in limbo after he was suspended through the end of the 2025 All-Star break back in March 2025. Julio Urías had shown the world his talent and had proved his worth on the field, despite having a massive injury to his left eye in 2015. While Julio Urías has been sentenced to 36 months of probation, here is everything that the star player was accused of.Back in 2023, Julio Urías had attended a LAFC soccer match, but things quickly went downhill after an eyewitness accused the star player of assaulting a woman outside the stadium.Julio Urías was immediately arrested by the authorities on suspiscion of felony domestic violence. Three days later, the MLB placed Julio Urías on administrative leave and since then, the free agent has not played a professional game in the league.Later, Julio Urías was charged by the Los Angeles City Attorney with 5 misdemeanour counts including assault, spousal battery, two counts of domestic battery and one for false imprisonment.At this point in time, Julio Urías is serving 36 months of probation, has to complete 52 weeks of counseling course on domestic abuse and 30 days of community service.In March 2025, Julio Urías was promptly removed from the 2025 All-Star break for violating MLB’s policies related to the incident.Commissioner Rob Manfred issued a statement on Julio Urías’ situation in the league and said, “The Office of the Commissioner of Baseball has completed its investigation into allegations that free agent pitcher Julio Urías violated Major League Baseball’s Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy. Having reviewed all of the available evidence, I have concluded that Mr. Urías violated our Policy and that discipline is appropriate. ”In early 2023, before all the mess, Julio Urías had signed a pretty expensive deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers. The deal was worth a whopping $14.25 million for a year.Also Read: “He has said some stuff publicly”: MLB insider Jeff Passan breaks down why the Washington Nationals might have fired Dave Martinez and Mike Rizzo",Julio Urías was accussed of domestic violence in 2023.

Inside Edgbaston: A Complete Stadium Tour

Poll Will India succeed in winning the next Test match at Lord's? Definitely Probably Unlikely Definitely not

From Edgbaston to Lord’s | Chasing the 3rd Test | Travel Vlog

Former India captain Sourav Ganguly believes that while Shubman Gill is currently experiencing a favourable period as India's Test captain, he will face increased pressure in the future.Ganguly, who celebrated his 53rd birthday on Tuesday, referenced his recent PTI interview while emphasising the continuous emergence of talented players in Indian cricket.Gill is currently 18 runs away from breaking Rahul Dravid's record of 602 runs, the highest by an Indian batter in a series in England. India secured a commanding 336-run victory at Edgbaston, levelling the five-match series 1-1.""This is the best I've seen him bat and I'm not surprised,"" Ganguly said while talking to reporters at Eden Gardens on the sidelines of his birthday celebration, as quoted by PTI.""There will always be players in Indian cricket after every generation. Whenever there's a void, players will come and fill it.""""There is so much talent in Indian cricket. In every generation, you will find players.""""After the great (Sunil) Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, (Sachin) Tendulkar, (Rahul) Dravid, (Anil) Kumble came and then (Virat) Kohli, now Gill, (Yashasvi) Jaiswal, Akash Deep, Mukesh (Kumar), (Mohammed) Siraj...just see the abundance of talent.""""In every generation, whenever there's a void, they will come and fill it. I've always said that.""Regarding his potential future as India's head coach, Ganguly maintained a cautious stance.""It's too early. There are many desires, but reality is different. Do you wish to become coach? Let's see, don't know,"" Ganguly said on Tuesday.In his debut as captain, Gill has accumulated 585 runs at an average of 146.25, including three centuries. His scores of 269 and 161 in Birmingham set multiple records, including the highest match aggregate by an Indian batter.Gill is approaching Don Bradman's 88-year-old record of most runs as captain in a Test series. Bradman scored 810 runs in five Tests during the 1936-37 Ashes, averaging 90 with three centuries. Gill needs 225 more runs to surpass this mark.""It's phenomenal. I hope his career will take a new direction. And I believe he's a middle-order batter. He has just become captain, it's a honeymoon period. But there would be more pressure with time. The pressure will build in the next three Tests.""Ganguly emphasized the importance of starting fresh at Lord's despite India's recent victory.""It's just one-all. There's still a lot to play for with three matches to go. India played well, and have been playing well. They may have lost at Headingley but they played well. But again, you have to start from scratch in the next match (at Lord's).""The new generation under Gill's leadership has performed admirably, compensating for the absence of veterans Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and R Ashwin.Ganguly suggests that a lively pitch at Lord's would benefit India.""It will be advantage India if it's a lively pitch. Because our batters will score runs and we'll be in a position to take 20 wickets. I've said before -- if you give grass and life on the wicket, we can take 20 wickets.""""Last week it was very hot in England, so it's flat. But it's a long way to go.""Regarding the bowling lineup for Lord's, Ganguly offered his perspective.""If the surface is brown, Kuldeep has to play 100 per cent. It depends on the surface. If it's green, you can have four pacers. If Kuldeep comes in, it could be either in Nitish (Kumar Reddy) or Washy's (Washington Sundar) place.""Akash Deep claimed ten wickets in the match while replacing Jasprit Bumrah, who was rested. The team also missed Mohammed Shami due to injury.Both Shami and Akash Deep developed their careers through Bengal's domestic cricket system, despite their origins in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, respectively.Addressing the debate about non-Bengali players representing Bengal, Ganguly acknowledged their dedication.""It's their hard work. They have come here, worked hard and with CAB's support have come this far. You have to give credit.""Ganguly celebrated his 53rd birthday with a cake-cutting ceremony in Dubai while returning from England.Born on July 8, 1972, Ganguly is recognized as one of Indian cricket's most influential leaders. He is credited with rebuilding the team after the match-fixing scandal and establishing India's success in overseas competitions.Ganguly's career statistics include 7,212 Test runs with 16 centuries between 1996 and 2008. In ODIs, he remains India's third-highest run-scorer with 11,363 runs and 22 centuries.","Former India captain Sourav Ganguly believes Shubman Gill will face more pressure in the future.

Mika Zibanejad’s recent form adds to the storyline

Fans are buzzing over a startling NHL insider Elliotte Friedman report on the 32 Thoughts Podcast. He hinted that the New York Rangers are in serious talks with center Mika Zibanejad as the team tries to prevent a repeat of early-season instability. Behind-the-scenes action in the Big Apple is what reallyOn July 8, 2025, Elliotte Friedman said it’s clear the New York Rangers are “trying to figure out a way to make it work” with Mika Zibanejad, even though nothing is certain. He noted the team is not starting this season like the last two, rumors and trade talk are beginning earlier than expected.The Rangers finished strong last spring, but fans and analysts are wary. It seems Zibanejad may need a firmer role or a new deal for the group to stay afloat. As Friedman explained, both sides want a long-term answer but time is ticking with training camp approaching.Entering the offseason, Zibanejad signed a notable contract in 2022, securing himself as a stable center in New York. However, the past two seasons saw decreased goal output and reduced ice time. Friedman mentioned “trade noise” around the Rangers, showing that Zibanejad’s future could be under review.In response, some believe moving Zibanejad could free salary cap space and create flexibility.

The Boston Celtics are entering a new chapter after their championship win. While fans were hoping for the core group to stay, changes are already happening. Big names are leaving, and others might follow. One of them is veteran center Al Horford. His future with the team now looks very uncertain, and fans are waiting to see what’s next.On July 9, Boston Celtics general manager Brad Stevens spoke to reporters in Boston. He said it is ""unlikely"" that Al Horford and Luke Kornet will return to the team. ""We made offers to both Luke and Al. We'd love to have both back. I'd say it's unlikely,"" Stevens said, as reported by ClutchPoints' Daniel Donabedian.Horford, now 39, is a free agent after finishing a two-year, $19.5 million contract. He spent seven total seasons in Boston, from 2016 to 2019 and again from 2021 to 2025. Stevens praised Horford's contributions and leadership. ""If he goes and plays somewhere else, I think he is an all-time Celtic. A winner, and someone who helped our younger players,"" he added.Stevens also spoke about two major trades that took place this offseason.Jrue Holiday was sent to the Portland Trail Blazers, and Kristaps Porzingis was traded to the Atlanta Hawks. According to ESPN's Bobby Marks, these trades saved the Celtics around $180 million in total. The team’s goal was to stay below the NBA’s second apron cap rule, which brings strong financial penalties.Stevens said, ""The second apron is the reason why those trades happened. The basketball penalties are real.""With Al Horford and Kristaps Porzingis possibly gone, Boston’s center depth now depends on Luka Garza and Xavier Tillman. Stevens said the team will rely on them, even though they are not well known yet.Some rumors have linked Al Horford to teams like the Golden State Warriors, Denver Nuggets, and Los Angeles Lakers. No deals have been confirmed.Brad Stevens made it clear the Celtics are not rebuilding, even with changes coming. He said, ""When you trade players like Jrue and KP, there’s some retooling. But we still have a strong group. I don’t think we’ll use the word ‘rebuild.’""With Jayson Tatum expected to miss next season due to an Achilles injury, fans will be watching closely to see how the Celtics handle the pressure.

“Didn’t take one gift,”

“Everything was donated to kids that don’t have shoes, that don’t have Christmas.”

Fans are calling it a rare act of class in today’s NFL chaos



“STAR IN THE MAKING,”

In a time when the NFL headlines are flooded with arrests, holdouts, and contract drama, one rookie just flipped the script with a story so pure it’ll make your heart melt. Patriots quarterback Drake Maye, fresh off his wedding to his middle-school sweetheart Ann Michael, quietly donated every single gift from the ceremony, the money, the presents, everything to children’s shelters and homeless centers. He didn’t post about it, didn’t make a statement, he just did it. And we only know thanks to a broadcaster who spilled the tea on air.According to longtime Patriots radio announcer Scott Zolak, the rookie QB and his wife donatedtheir wedding gifts both physical items and cash to local shelters that help children in need.Zolak said during a recent segment.Zolak revealed the couple made the donation quietly, without telling anyone publicly. It wasn’t some social media stunt or brand collab. It was simply about giving back.The donations reportedly went to shelters and centers in North Carolina, where Maye grew up and became a hometown hero long before going pro.This move wasn’t impulsive. It turns out, Drake and Ann Michael had made this decision years ago, way before the NFL spotlight.According to reports, the couple promised each other that if Drake ever “made it,” they would use their wedding as a chance to give back to the community that raised them. So when the wedding rolled around this June, they kept their word. Every dollar, every wrapped box, all gone straight to shelters helping kids in tough situations. It wasn’t just about generosity; it was about following through on a dream they shared before fame, cameras, or the NFL ever entered the picture.Once the news got out, fans absolutely flooded social media with praise. Patriots supporters and even rival fans are hailing Maye as a true role model.one person wrote on X. Others pointed out how rare it is for a rookie to do something this selfless, especially without publicizing it for attention.It’s not often the NFL gives us a wholesome headline like this, especially one that’s not part of a press release or PR tour.

Capitals legend Alex Ovechkin teases NHL fans with cryptic update on his retirement timeline



As the NHL gears up for the 2025–26 campaign, all eyes remain fixed on Alex Ovechkin, the Washington Capitals legend who made history by surpassing Wayne Gretzky’s all-time goals record. At 40 years old, Ovechkin now holds the crown as the league’s greatest goal scorer, and fans are wondering — will this be his final lap?Last season was nothing short of monumental. The Russian superstar netted an astonishing 44 goals, proving he still has that lethal scoring touch. But despite the milestone and whispers of retirement growing louder, Ovechkin isn’t ready to close the door — at least, not yet.“To be honest with you, I haven’t thought about it yet, but we’ll see what’s going to happen,” Ovechkin told reporters following his record-breaking campaign. “Obviously, I’m going to try to do my best to be able to do well next year and, how I said, we’ll see.”That non-committal response is vintage Ovi — fiercely focused on the present, not distracted by legacy talk or long goodbyes. With the final year of his current contract approaching, speculation about his future has hit a fever pitch. Still, he remains determined to give Capitals fans one more thrilling ride.After appearing somewhat out of shape last offseason, Ovechkin has returned to the grind. He’s back in the gym, sharing clips of his workouts, signaling that he's far from mailing it in.The 2025–26 season marks his 21st year in the NHL — a feat in itself — and judging by his commitment, he’s looking to finish on his own terms.For Capitals fans, the good news is that Ovechkin is fully engaged. He may no longer dominate in all aspects of the game like he once did, but when it comes to finding the net, no one does it better — even after two decades.Every goal this season will not only extend his own record but also solidify a legacy that few in professional sports can match. Whether this is the farewell tour or not, Ovechkin’s journey isn't over yet. He's here for at least one more run — and that might be all the fuel he needs to deliver another unforgettable season.Also Read: NHL bans Alex Ovechkin from Russian interviews — fans question league’s motives","Alex Ovechkin scored 44 goals last season, surpassing Wayne Gretzky's all-time goals record.

Nikola Jokic chooses to delay contract extension eyeing 80 million more by waiting until 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/nikola-jokic-chooses-to-delay-contract-extension-eyeing-80-million-more-by-waiting-until-2026/articleshow/122331058.cms,"Nikola Jokic chooses to delay contract extension eyeing 80 million more by waiting until 2026 (Image Source: Getty Images)

How delaying until 2026 could net Jokic a fourth year and tens of millions extra

Most players jump at the chance for $212 million. Nikola Jokic isn’t most players. By choosing not to sign an extension this summer, the MVP-caliber center is banking on an even bigger payday in 2026 — possibly close to $290 million. He’s at his peak, injury-free, and his team is actively rebuilding around him. This isn’t hesitation — it’s strategy. And Jokic is executing it as perfectly as one of his no-look passes.On July 8, Bennett Durando of The Denver Post confirmed that Jokic has informed the Nuggets he won't be signing an extension this offseason. He became eligible for a three-year extension worth up to $212 million on Tuesday, but instead, Jokic has chosen to wait. What's the reason? By postponing until summer 2026, he could add a fourth year and around $77–80 million more, which would raise his total potential earnings to nearly $290 million.From a financial perspective, dragging out the extension discussions really boosts his bargaining power. Jokic has two guaranteed seasons remaining (2025–26 and 2026–27), along with a player option valued at $62.8 million for 2027–28.With no signs of injury or age issues, he’s performing at his best and has complete control over his future. Nuggets vice-chair Josh Kroenke noted the importance of transparency in the talks but anticipates that Jokic will stand his ground for the time being.On the court, Jokic had an incredible season - averaging 29.6 points, 12.7 rebounds, 10.2 assists, with a 41.7% shooting rate from three, and he ranked second in MVP voting for the fifth consecutive year. Off the court, the Nuggets made some changes, letting go of coach Michael Malone, swapping out GM Calvin Booth, and bringing in Cam Johnson, Jonas Valanciunas, Bruce Brown, and Tim Hardaway Jr.Despite getting knocked out in the second round of the playoffs two years in a row, Denver is still very much Jokic’s team. The front office is obviously trying to construct a team around him, and Jokic’s aim to boost his earnings matches that strategy. Fans on Reddit are applauding his choice - saying it makes ""perfect financial sense"" - and analysts believe that postponing is a clever idea.Also Read: LeBron James tried golf and the internet is shocked by what his swing looks like next to Charles Barkley’s Nikola Jokic isn’t ditching Denver—he’s just playing it smart. With two years still on his supermax contract, a player option coming up, and a shot at an extra $80 million plus a fourth year, waiting is definitely the way to go. Denver keeps enhancing its roster, and Jokic has the leverage. When they start talking again in 2026, both he and the franchise will be ready to strike a deal and maybe even go for another title.","Nikola Jokic became eligible for a three-year contract extension worth up to $212 million on Tuesday.

Lakers Already Building a Competitive Core

A Missed Opportunity, But Not the End

Thehave been aggressive this offseason, crafting a well-rounded roster around Luka Doncic and LeBron James. Bolstering the frontcourt with Deandre Ayton has checked one of the key boxes for the franchise. Yet, one of their loftiest summer goals—landing former Warriors champion Andrew Wiggins—may no longer be within reach.Despite being linked to the 2022 NBA champion and former No. 1 overall pick, the Lakers ’ pursuit of Andrew Wiggins appears to have hit a wall. According to Lakers insider Jovan Buha, there’s little optimism surrounding the trade’s viability.“I don’t know if Wiggins at this point is looking realistic (for the Lakers),” Buha stated in a recent update. (H/t: Sporting News)This update delivers a major blow to fans who envisioned Wiggins’ two-way skill set complementing the star-studded Lakers lineup. His blend of scoring, perimeter defense, and experience made him an appealing target for a team looking to contend immediately.Andrew Wiggins entered the 2024-25 season as the Warriors’ second-leading scorer and remained a fan favorite in Golden State. However, the team’s struggles early in the campaign prompted GM Mike Dunleavy Jr. to act decisively. Just a day before the February trade deadline, Wiggins was dealt to the Miami Heat in exchange for six-time All-Star Jimmy Butler.Despite the sudden transition, Wiggins adjusted quickly in Miami.Functioning as one of the top scoring options in South Beach, he helped guide the Heat to a first-round postseason appearance. His slashing ability and respectable outside shooting made him a valuable addition to Miami’s rotation.While the dream of pairing Wiggins with Doncic and LeBron may be fading, the Lakers have made strides elsewhere. They added:- Jake LaRavia: A reliable three-point shooter to stretch the floor.- Deandre Ayton: A proven screener and rebounder, ideal for Doncic’s pick-and-roll schemes.- Jaxson Hayes: Re-signed on a one-year deal as frontcourt depth and Ayton’s stylistic backup.These moves indicate that the front office is committed to building a system that amplifies Doncic’s strengths and keeps LeBron’s championship window open.Though a trade for Andrew Wiggins would’ve added another seasoned playoff performer to the mix, the Lakers are still in a solid position heading into the season. The roster continues to take shape with purposeful signings and a clear vision.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors predicted to land $22,141,697 Sacramento Kings guard in a bold deal with Jonathan Kuminga as key trade asset Still, fans can’t help but wonder what could have been if Wiggins had donned purple and gold.","The Los Angeles Lakers have been linked to the 2022 NBA champion and former No. 1 overall pick.

After James shared a video of his stiff, arm-heavy swing, the internet quickly erupted with jokes and critiques. While it's only Day 2 of his golf journey, some are already suggesting James' swing might rival Barkley's infamous struggles on the green.

It was only Day 2 of LeBron James’ golf journey, but the internet wasn’t feeling generous. After sharing a stiff, arm-heavy swing on July 4, fans instantly compared him to none other than Charles Barkley—golf’s most legendary disaster. The clip went viral, the jokes rolled in, and suddenly LeBron’s greatness on the court meant nothing on the green. Could he really be worse than Chuck? That’s what everyone’s asking.LeBron shared his most recent swing on July 4, describing golf as ""a mind f**k to say the least."" The video shows a rigid, arm-dominant motion with very little wrist movement, leading fans to compare it to Charles Barkley’s well-known mid-swing hitch. One social media post even straightforwardly remarked that the swing “draws comparisons to NBA legend Charles Barkley’s famously awkward form”.Charles Barkley kicked off his golf journey in the early 1990s with a lot of promise—he had a single-digit handicap and often shot below 80. However, after he began taking numerous lessons, his swing fell apart in the mid-90s, spiraling from sub-80 rounds to over 100 strokes. His swing became a spectacle of awkward pauses and spasms. It got so infamous that even Tiger Woods made fun of it, and coaches like Hank Haney tried to fix it on camera in The Haney Project.At 40, LeBron is still one of the top basketball players, but golf is a whole different challenge. In his Instagram post, he confessed it was only Day 2 and hinted that getting the hang of golf would be a lengthy and humbling journey. Even though he produced a good drive distance, reviewers pointed out that his swing was too stiff, driven by his arms, and didn't have the smooth wrist action needed—making it a recipe for awkward moments and memes.The internet jumped right in. While it's widely accepted that Barkley is the cringe king of golf swings, a lot of folks joked that LeBron’s form ""might actually be worse."" One poll showed that people rated LeBron’s swing as ""Better than Barkley’s""—but just barely. Comments like ""That swing is worse than anything Barkley ever did"" are coming in hot.Charles Barkley might still be known for having the most awkward golf swing, but LeBron James is definitely stepping up to the plate. It’s just the beginning (we're only on Day 2), and with LeBron's youth and incredible athletic skills, there's a lot to be hopeful about.","LeBron James' golf debut sparks instant Charles Barkley comparisons.

Jared Goff gets brutally honest about Rams trade and emotional fallout with Sean McVay



When the Los Angeles Rams dealt Jared Goff to the Detroit Lions in January 2021, it sent shockwaves through the NFL . But for Goff, the real jolt came from the manner in which it all unfolded. In the latest season of Netflix’s Quarterback, Goff opened up about the abrupt and impersonal way he learned of the trade — a moment that left him stunned and questioning his worth.“Three weeks after the last game of the season, get a call from Sean [McVay] and really did not expect anything,” Goff recalled. “He lets me know they're trading me to Detroit, and I'm like, ‘Whoa, OK, all right. What the hell? What's happening?’ I would say about 30 seconds after that phone call, it was on Twitter.”It wasn’t just the news that stung — it was the lack of communication leading up to it. “You feel like you've been betrayed, or like you're not wanted,” Goff admitted. “And I think for me, ultimately it was the fact that there was not a conversation had... There was nothing.”That feeling of betrayal still lingers. But instead of crumbling, Goff used it as fuel.His early days in Detroit were rocky, but he’s since engineered one of the most compelling comeback stories in recent NFL memory.From being discarded by a Super Bowl team to leading the Lions to two straight NFC North titles, Goff’s resurgence has been remarkable.In 2023, Goff not only ended Detroit’s decades-long playoff victory drought but also eliminated his former team in a poetic postseason showdown. By 2024, he had silenced any remaining critics by putting up career-best numbers — 37 passing touchdowns, a 111.8 passer rating, and leading Detroit to a 15-2 regular season and the No. 1 seed in the NFC.The trade that was once viewed as a one-sided victory for the Rams — who went on to win a Super Bowl with Matthew Stafford — is now a much more balanced narrative. Goff didn’t just survive in Detroit; he turned a long-struggling franchise into a genuine contender.Meanwhile, even Sean McVay has acknowledged he mishandled the situation, admitting over time that he could’ve communicated better during the transition.Goff, for his part, isn’t dwelling on it — but he’s certainly not forgetting it either. “You wish that there was some sort of maturity... to let me know what’s going on and how things went down and why this is happening,” he added on Quarterback.From feeling discarded to becoming Detroit’s undisputed leader, Jared Goff’s journey is not just a story of redemption — it’s a statement.Also Read: Travis Kelce rumored to be “seriously considering” a summer proposal to Taylor Swift as fans dissect clues and whispers",Jared Goff was traded by the Los Angeles Rams to the Detroit Lions in 2021.

Media pressure is taking a toll on Swift and Kelce

A conscious decision to pause and protect their peace



For months, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce ’s romance has dominated headlines—and now, the couple is finally signaling their intent to slow things down, at least publicly. Amid relentless speculation about a possible engagement, the pop megastar and NFL tight end are choosing a quieter, more intentional approach to their love story, according to a new insider report.A source close to the couple told Star Magazine that the nonstop media obsession is wearing them down. “Taylor and Travis are tired of all the pressure and endless discussion about their status,” the insider revealed. Between paparazzi snapshots, fan theories, and the constant swirl of wedding rumors, the pair—who are arguably the most famous couple in the world right now—have found themselves at the center of a media circus.It all escalated recently when a wedding planner claimed to have sent an invite to “Taylor and Travis Kelce,” sending social media into a frenzy. But Swift herself cleared the air during a visit to Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital in Florida.When a young fan asked why she was there, Swift candidly replied, “My boyfriend is training here.” The moment, caught on video and shared across platforms like X (formerly Twitter), was the clearest public confirmation yet that she and Kelce are still together—though not engaged.While fans may be eager for a red carpet proposal or another viral moment, Swift and Kelce are focused on protecting their relationship from the outside noise. After spending time apart during her Eras Tour, they’re now prioritizing quality time together. The source emphasized, “They’re just enjoying being together right now.”Still, Swift and Kelce aren’t completely shutting the door on sharing updates in the future. “When there’s news to share, they will,” the insider added—suggesting that the couple wants to control the timing and tone of any big announcement on their own terms.Also Read: “He isn't going to ask for her hand”: Travis Kelce holds off on proposing to Taylor Swift despite their strong and supportive relationship Until then, fans may need to accept that not every love story comes with a press release—and sometimes, the most meaningful connections thrive quietly behind the scenes.","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are reportedly scaling back their public appearances.

Travis Kelce still not GOAT? Gronk lays out his rules to earn that crown and overtake him



Rob Gronkowski vs. Danny Amendola | Hot Ones Versus

The NFL offseason might be quiet on the field, but that hasn’t stopped its biggest stars from igniting lively conversations off of it. Patrick Mahomes recently made headlines during a candid conversation with Kay Adams, but it’s Rob Gronkowski and Danny Amendola who have stolen the spotlight with their hilarious and now-viral appearance on “Hot Ones Versus. ” As fans debate the tight end GOAT, Gronkowski didn’t shy away from throwing some spicy — quite literally — takes into the fire.In a wing-fueled showdown with Amendola, Gronkowski playfully addressed what Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce needs to do to surpass him as the greatest tight end in NFL history. And true to form, Gronk’s list was as entertaining as it was outrageous.“You gotta throw some motherf------ defenders out the club,” Gronkowski said without blinking. “Two, you need another Super Bowl ring. There you go. Thank you Danny. Danny said that one. We're helping each other out because we're teammates like that. And three... you gotta party your face into the dirt with your fans. Sorry Trav, I wasn't eating another wing. I love you brother.”The lighthearted exchange captured the friendly bond between Gronkowski and Kelce — two stars who’ve helped redefine the tight end position.Their connection isn’t surprising considering their joint efforts with “Tight End University,” a collaborative initiative where top tight ends mentor and uplift one another.While Gronk’s remarks were delivered with a side of hot sauce and humor, they touch on a deeper, ongoing debate in NFL circles. Gronkowski’s résumé includes four Super Bowl rings — three with Tom Brady and the Patriots, and one with the Buccaneers — and a legacy built on dominance. With 92 touchdowns and nearly 9,300 receiving yards, his impact is undeniable. He also holds the second-most Super Bowl touchdown receptions in league history, trailing only Jerry Rice.Kelce, meanwhile, is quietly crafting a different kind of legacy — one built on consistency and adaptability. With 1,004 receptions, over 12,000 receiving yards, and 77 touchdowns through 11 seasons, he’s shown no signs of slowing down. His playoff production, where he ranks just behind Rice in receiving categories, further fuels the argument.What separates the two is not ability, but how they reached their greatness. Gronk’s dominance was almost gladiatorial — raw, physical, and explosive. Kelce’s brilliance lies in his finesse, route-running, and ability to be anywhere on the field at once.As Kelce enters the 2025 season, the only box left to check may be that elusive fourth Super Bowl ring. And if he wins it? Even Gronk might need a fifth to keep the GOAT crown firmly in his hands.Also Read: Taylor Swift set to become Chiefs’ biggest fan as she commits to Travis Kelce’s full 2025 season","Rob Gronkowski and Danny Amendola appeared on ""Hot Ones Versus"" Gronkowski laid out a list of things Travis Kelce needs to do to surpass him as the greatest tight end in NFL history.

Kelly Olynyk joins Victor Wembanyama-led San Antonio Spurs in strategic roster overhaul



In a bold offseason move, the San Antonio Spurs have acquired veteran big man Kelly Olynyk from the Washington Wizards in exchange for guards Malaki Branham, Blake Wesley, and a 2026 second-round draft pick. The trade, first reported by Shams Charania of ESPN, adds another skilled stretch-five to San Antonio’s growing frontcourt rotation, while Washington continues its youth-focused rebuild with added flexibility.Kelly Olynyk is on the move again, his third trade in five months. After brief stints with Toronto, New Orleans, and most recently Washington, the 34-year-old Canadian now finds himself in San Antonio. Now, he'll play alongside rising phenom Victor Wembanyama and recent free-agent addition Luke Kornet.“The Washington Wizards are trading Kelly Olynyk to the San Antonio Spurs for Malaki Branham, Blake Wesley and a 2026 second-round pick (least favorable of Dallas, Philadelphia, Oklahoma City),” reported Shams Charania on X.He added, “The deal gives the Spurs another stretch big after the free agent signing of Luke Kornet, and Washington receives two more young players as the Wizards continue to add some talent this offseason with potential for increased opportunity along with an expected later second-rounder.”Olynyk brings with him valuable experience and a versatile game. Last season, he averaged 8.7 points and 4.7 rebounds while shooting an impressive 41.8% from beyond the arc. Despite playing just 44 games due to injury, he proved to be a better defender than expected and a steady presence on both ends of the floor. He now joins a Spurs team that's actively retooling around Wembanyama and De’Aaron Fox.For the Wizards, the return centers around two former first-round picks in Branham and Wesley. While their development stalled in San Antonio, a fresh start in Washington could offer more opportunity. Still, the Wizards’ backcourt is crowded with names like Marcus Smart, CJ McCollum, and recent draftees Stephon Castle and Dylan Harper. The trade also creates a $13 million trade exception for Washington and saves them approximately $5 million, depending on final structuring.Interestingly, this deal also brings an unexpected twist to a past Spurs trade. Blake Wesley was originally acquired with a pick from the 2022 Derrick White trade to Boston. That once-overlooked draft asset has now been flipped to bring in a veteran big man who fills an immediate need.Also Read: Kevin Durant gives heartfelt credit to his mom Wanda Durant for his stunning basketball career As San Antonio continues to balance youth with experience, head coach Mitch Johnson suddenly has a deep, versatile group to work with.

Connor McDavid contract extension: NHL analyst predicts $16–18 million short-term deal with Oilers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/connor-mcdavid-contract-extension-nhl-analyst-predicts-1618-million-short-term-deal-with-edmonton-oilers/articleshow/122321306.cms,"Connor McDavid may sign $16–18M if Oilers compete (Image via: Getty Images)

NHL Insider predicts $16M–$18M short-term deal for Connor McDavid



Can the Oilers afford to risk losing Connor McDavid in free agency?



Connor McDavid is officially eligible to sign a contract extension, and the buzz around his next deal is already heating up. With just two seasons remaining on his current eight-year, $100 million contract, the Edmonton Oilers face mounting pressure to lock up the NHL’s biggest superstar before free agency becomes a real threat.On TSN’s FanDuel Overdrive, NHL analyst Martin Biron weighed in on what kind of extension the Oilers captain could command. With the NHL salary cap projected to rise to $103.5 million, McDavid can legally sign a deal worth up to 20% of the cap, approximately $20.7 million per year.But Biron doesn’t expect McDavid to chase the full max. Instead, he predicts a short-term, two-year bridge deal worth between $16 million and $18 million per season. That number would still make McDavid the highest-paid player in NHL history while allowing Edmonton to retain enough cap space to improve the roster around him.However, Biron issued a clear warning. McDavid could accept a slightly lower salary, but only if the Oilers meet key conditions. “I think $18 million is the number,” said Biron. “But I wouldn’t be surprised if Connor McDavid, if the Oilers are solid, says, ‘I’ll go to $16 million on a two-year deal.’But you know that’s coming with strings attached, if it’s not good, it’s bye-bye, and I’m gone.”McDavid is coming off another elite season with 100 points in 67 regular-season games and 33 points in 22 playoff appearances. He’s led the Oilers to consecutive Stanley Cup Final trips, but Edmonton has failed to close the deal, falling short again to the Florida Panthers.The Oilers now face a crucial moment to build a championship-caliber team around McDavid now, or risk losing him in 2026 free agency. With 2026 free agency approaching, Connor McDavid’s future forces Oilers to build a Stanley Cup team or risk losing him.Also Read: Sidney Crosby Trade Rumors: NHL Insider links Penguins star to Canadiens for final cup run This looming decision could define the next decade of NHL power dynamics.
