Who was Jack Hoffman?

Jack Hoffman , who played a huge role in an iconic moment of Nebraska football , died from cancer at the age of 19. He was in his freshman year at the University of Nebraska-Kearney. His relationship with NU started in 2012 when he was fighting pediatric brain cancer . It was inspired by former Husker running back Rex Burkhead , who received a letter from Hoffman and his family when Burkhead was injured.Jack Hoffman was a Nebraska boy who had been diagnosed with pediatric brain cancer and had been a football player for his local high school. Hoffman died from a diffuse high-grade neuroepithelial tumor on January, 15, 2025.In 2012, in between his first and second brain surgery, Jack Hoffman met Rex Burkhead, then an offensive player for the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Shortly thereafter, Jack became one with the team. On April 6, 2013, at the annual Nebraska spring game, 7-year-old Hoffman entered the game in the fourth quarter and ran for a 69 yards (63 m) touchdown which brought him into national and international prominence.He then met with President Barack Obama, received the Best Moment ESPY Award for 2013, and the United States Senate passed a resolution honoring him for his efforts in calling attention to pediatric brain cancer. He formed the Team Jack Foundation , through which his parents, Andy and Bri Hoffman, fundraise for pediatric brain research.On August 5, 2014, Hoffman learned that his tumor had increased in size since his MRI in April of 2014. His father told him that in April there was a spot on his scan that was suspicious, but that they had been hoping it was nothing; probable options were chemotherapy or surgery.After consulting with Hoffman's medical team, in mid-August 2014, his parents decided to pursue a clinical trial in Boston involving a genetic therapy approach, in part because the cancer has spread to the brain stem, making surgery difficult. After the 13-month clinical trial, Hoffman had been off cancer treatment since 2015.Also Read: ‚ÄúNot trying to be your friend‚Äù: Lamar Jackson had some honest words for his rival Josh Allen just days before their kickoff at Highmark Stadium The Hoffman family subsequently established the Team Jack Foundation, which as of December 2020 raised roughly $8 million for pediatric brain cancer research.",Jack Hoffman was a Nebraska boy who had been diagnosed with pediatric brain cancer.

LiAngelo Ball Was Cut From the NBA Three Times Before Getting His Big Break

NBA Legend LeBron James who is also the NBA‚Äôs all-time leader in career earnings, recently took to Instagram to highlight the Ball Brothers, Lonzo, LaMelo, and LiAngelo Ball ‚Äôs stellar achievement. James reacted to a post highlighting that the Ball Brothers have earned a combined $296 million throughout their careers. LeBron James put the post on his Instagram story and used the raise arms emoji to praise LiAngelo, LaMelo, and Lonzo‚Äôs amazing achievement.This figure mainly consists of the career earnings of NBA stars Lonzo and LaMelo. The eldest brother, Lonzo Ball signed a $80 million contract back in 2021. LaMelo Ball who is the Charlotte Hornets‚Äô best player signed a $203.8 million deal with the team back in July 2023. Last but not least, LiAngelo Ball‚Äôs recent hip-hop hit ‚ÄúTweaker‚Äù has earned him a $13 million deal with recording label, Def Jam.This was a much-needed win for LiAngelo who has been a little unfortunate in comparison to his brothers. Lonzo and LaMelo have made a name for themselves in the NBA with LaMelo Ball being one of the most exciting prospects in the league. LiAngelo was supposed to be in the league with them but could never make it work.LiAngelo signed three separate contracts with two different NBA teams. He first inked an Exhibit 10 contract with the Detroit Pistons on December 2, 2020. But, was waived by them just 12 days later on December 14, 2020. Ball was able to land himself another contract with the Charlotte Hornets on October 14, 2021. Unfortunately, he was waived just a day later on October 15, 2021. LiAngelo Ball got another opportunity with the Hornets on September 26, 2022. But, the Hornets decided to waive him once again on October 15, 2022. Following this, Ball spent some time in the G-League but failed to land himself an NBA contract. Then Ball did a brief stint in a Mexican league, but it seems like music was his true calling. With any luck, Tweaker will be the first of many hits that LiAngelo Ball puts out this year.ALSO READ: Lamelo Ball's Brother, LiAngelo Ball, Signs Massive $8 Million Deal With Def Jam LiAngelo Ball‚Äôs deal with Def Jam also allows him to retain all the rights to his music and record label.

Sydney Cricket Ground is love at first sight: SCG museum, walk of fame and all the facilities

NEW DELHI: Jasprit Bumrah has been advised bed rest at home and the future course of action will be finalised only after swelling in his back subsides. The seamer reached home last week after a long tour of Australia and the current situation doesn't look very encouraging.It is reliably understood that while Bumrah will have to report to the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru, there is no date of his check-in yet.""Bumrah could go to the CoE next week but right now there is no fixed date yet. He has been advised bed rest at home to help the muscles recover and the swelling to subside. Once that is done, future course of action will be ascertained,"" said a well-placed source.The initial word is that it's just swelling in the back and Bumrah will not be rushed back to cricket at this stage. With his history of back issues, the last thing stakeholders want is aggravating it. There is no clarity on his exact diagnosis yet but if it's something severe than just swelling, return could take longer.""Bed rest doesn't sound good. I hope it's not a disc bulge or a muscle swelling which is of a higher grade. The approach has to be similar with him - wrap him in cotton wool and preserve the talent like him,"" added the source.Former Team India strength and conditioning coach Ramji Srinivasan feels the exact time of rest and recovery can only be ascertained after a thorough diagnosis. He further explained that it depends whether the swelling is in the muscle or on disc.""Swelling happens if there is a tear because of edema formation - which depends on the grade of tear in the muscle. If it's a disc bulge or swelling then recovery also depends on grade, individual capacity, medical intervention and post medical rehab work,"" says Srinivasan.The stakeholders would hope that it remains swelling in the back because a disc bulge could delay his return to professional cricket. There is a long season ahead with the Champions Trophy, IPL and India's tour of England and Bumrah needs to carefully manage his recovery and return.There are still few days left before India pick their provisional squad for the Champions Trophy and it now remains to be seen whether the selectors include him in the list of 15. They are allowed to make changes until February 13 and are understood to be waiting for the final report from the medical team before taking the crucial Bumrah call.","Jasprit Bumrah has been advised bed rest at home and the future course of action will be finalised only after swelling in his back subsides.

When India head coach Gautam Gambhir lost his cool in Australia

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has called on the Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI ) to reduce the squad size for the upcoming Test series against England in June. Gavaskar, writing in his column for Sportstar, expressed concerns about the oversized contingent India took on their recent tour of Australia, which included 19 players, reserves included.Gavaskar acknowledged the need for a larger squad in Australia due to logistical challenges but insisted the England tour requires a more streamlined approach. ""Carrying more than 16 players will indicate the selectors are unsure, and that's never a good sign. Just because the BCCI can afford to send a large party doesn't mean the India cap should be given just like that,"" he stated.While he recommended taking additional bowlers for practice purposes, Gavaskar was firm on not awarding them the India cap unless absolutely necessary. ""The usual problem overseas is a lack of practice bowlers, so by all means take a few bowlers over, and they can be given the training and clothing, but not the India cap,"" he added.Gavaskar also emphasised the importance of practice matches, urging the Indian team to schedule as many as possible during the England series. Reflecting on the recent Border-Gavaskar Trophy , where India opted for intra-squad games and a single tour match, Gavaskar called for a shift in approach.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy ""There will be some gaps between the Test matches, and these need to be utilised for practice games. Travel in England is by road almost every time, and the India team will drive down to the next Test venue on the last evening of the previous Test match. Since there won't be a travel day involved, giving the next day off after the Test is understandable, but the next couple should be used for practice,"" he explained.The batting great also suggested eliminating optional practice sessions, advocating for the coach and captain to determine the team's schedule. ""This recent tradition of optional practice should be done away with, and only the coach and captain should decide who gets days off from practice, and this should not be left to the individual player to decide,"" he wrote.Also See: Champions Trophy Fixtures 2025 Concluding his remarks, Gavaskar expressed optimism about India's depth and the opportunity for a refreshed squad to make a strong statement in England. ""Indian cricket has depth, or so we are told, and hopefully, that will be seen in England, where a new India can show they are ready to take on the world,"" he said.","Gavaskar has called on the Board of Control for Cricket in India to reduce the squad size for the upcoming Test series against England.

BCCI feels team bonding missing

LIVE: India Champions Trophy squad: Who should make up the Rohit Sharma-led side?

Return to strict fitness levels?

NEW DELHI: As India tries to recover from back-to-back debacles in the Test series against New Zealand and Australia, BCCI has identified lack of team bonding and the need for a strict fitness regimen as key areas to be worked upon.TOI understands while the board has received strong feedback from head coach Gautam Gambhir on these issues, itwill also reassess his role after the upcoming Champions Trophy next month At a meeting between BCCI, Gambhir, captain Rohit Sharma and chief selector Ajit Agarkar , it was mentioned there should be curbs on the amount of time players spend with wives/partners on a long tour. The fact that some players prefer to travel alone and asked for separate accommodation on tours was discussed.Gambhir's involvement with the team beyond the field too has been questioned, and he could be advised to have more team bonding exercises.""The board is a bit concerned that a team which has been so consistent across formats for more than half a decade is suddenly struggling to click with almost the same set of players. It comes down to a lack of galvanising force in the team. It has emerged that players are consumed in their individual lives once they are done with training or a game,"" a BCCI source said.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 ""Players these days have their families around along with a big entourage. Some have even requested to stay in different hotels and a few have made their own travel arrangements within the country. These players are barely seen with the rest of the team. The board is contemplating restricting the length of stay for families to two weeks on a lengthy tour,"" the source added.On a key observation coming out of the meeting about the need to rebuild team spirit beyond game time, the source said, ""One expected the team to have a customary celebratory team dinner after India won the first Test in Perth. Instead, everyone in the squad went out in groups.Gambhir went out with his own people. There was only one team dinner during the two-month tour. Previous team management used to organize outdoor activities with the entire team. It helps in building team spirit,"" the source said.TOI understands that Gambhir has cancelled the culture of optional training sessions for the same reason. He feels that the entire team needs to train together to enhance synergy amongst the players and there is no point of a handful of players turning up for practice.It has been suggested that the BCCI medical team should go back to having fitness criteria for selection instead of just focusing on injury prevention. The previous team management had done away with the yo-yo test that was a key parameter for selection during Virat Kohli 's captaincy days.""The board had gone lenient on the players since they are mostly on the road. The focus had shifted to just injury prevention. This has been taken lightly by some players. It is being mooted that a certain fitness level criteria needs to be reintroduced so that complacency doesn't creep in,"" the source said.","BCCI feels team bonding missing and need for strict fitness regimen.

The Indian women's cricket team achieved their biggest ODI victory by demolishing Ireland by an astonishing 304 runs in Rajkot on Wednesday, completing a 3-0 clean sweep. The match result was a foregone conclusion once India set a massive target of 436 runs for Ireland to chase.Ireland could only muster 131 runs before being bundled out in 31.4 overs. India's record-breaking performance was led by skipper Smriti Mandhana 's 70-ball century and her opening partner Pratika Rawal 's 154 runs off 129 balls, propelling the team to a total of 435/5, the highest by any Indian team in ODIs.Mandhana and Rawal's opening partnership of 233 runs in just 26.4 overs set the stage for an unstoppable Indian victory. Spinners Tanuja Kanwar and Deepti Sharma then took charge, sharing five wickets between them to decimate the inexperienced Irish lineup.Orla Prendergast and Sarah Forbes provided some resistance with a 64-run partnership for the third wicket, helping Ireland recover from 24/2 to 88. However, once Prendergast was dismissed by Kanwar, India dominated the tourists, claiming the remaining seven wickets for just 33 runs.This victory also surpassed India's previous largest margin of victory by runs, which was 249 against the same opposition in 2017 at Potchefstroom, South Africa. Mandhana's 10th ODI century came off just 70 deliveries, surpassing Harmanpreet Kaur 's 87-ball hundred against South Africa last year.India joined Australia and New Zealand in the elite list of teams that have breached the 400-run mark in ODIs. Mandhana's destructive batting included aerial shots over the 'V' and clearing the 30-yard circle, while Pratika complemented her captain brilliantly with a measured knock, notching her maiden international century in her sixth innings.Their 233-run partnership made them only the fourth Indian pair to record a 200-run stand in Women's ODIs and the third instance of both Indian openers scoring hundreds in ODIs. The duo maintained a brisk scoring rate throughout their partnership, adding 90 runs during the Power Play and 67 in the subsequent 10 overs.Mandhana reached her first century of the calendar year with an exquisite drive off Arlene Kelly, who bore the brunt of her onslaught. Even Kelly's variations were dispatched with ease, with Mandhana following a six with another boundary in the 24th over.Mandhana also took on Ireland's leading bowler, Prendergast, smashing her for a boundary down the ground and a towering six over long-on. Promoted to No. 3, Richa Ghosh also returned to form, making a 37-ball fifty, her fifth in ODIs.","India beat Ireland by 304 runs to complete 3-0 ODI clean sweep.

I think it's our luck that we played the first match at the Wankhede and we're alive!""""It was an absolutely memorable match, because it was the first (first-class) match ever played at the Wankhede Stadium. And today, after 50 years, people and MCA still remember (us). It shows how much they love the game. This kind of a recognition to us, Rs 10 lakhs, is secondary for us, because the most important thing is that the MCA has given us the opportunity to play. That itself is a bigger award and reward. There cannot be a bigger reward than this. We appreciate this gesture with all our heart,"" Ghavri, 73, told reporters.In the morning, the MCA organized a felicitation function where it honoured almost 200 groundsmen of Mumbai, including three of its curators-Ramesh Mamunkar, Nadeem Menon and Madhukar Botle at the Wankhede Stadium. There was an interactive session with Mumbai's Ranji Trophy captain Ajinkya Rahane and Dr Adil Chagla for the groundsmen, a health camp and then a special lunch for the groundstaff, the unsung heroes of cricket.

NEW DELHI: Iga Swiatek advanced to the Australian Open 's third round with a commanding 6-0, 6-2 victory over Rebecca Sramkova , marking her continued return to competition following a doping suspension in the previous year.The second-seeded player immediately established dominance by breaking Sramkova's serve in the opening game and maintained control throughout the match.The Slovakian player, ranked 49th globally and making her Grand Slam second-round debut, struggled against Swiatek's superior technique and forceful play.In the initial set lasting 27 minutes, Swiatek dominated by winning 64 percent of points on Sramkova's first serve, surrendering merely 10 points.The Rod Laver Arena audience warmly applauded when Sramkova finally secured her first game in the eighth game of the match.Swiatek maintained her authority throughout, securing victory in precisely 60 minutes.""I felt really solid today and it was a really efficient game,"" said Swiatek.

She missed the season-opener Malaysia Open Super 1000 in Kuala Lumpur last week. It was evident during the match that Sindhu was a bit rusty. There were several unforced errors during the second game. At one point, she was getting quite frustrated as Sung built a healthy 11-4 lead. Sindhu took a little break and had a courtside chat with her new coach Irwansyah Adi Pratama, a renowned Indonesian coach who is now in charge of the Indian women‚Äôs singles players.""The chat was mostly about hitting my strokes deep and making better use of the court. She (Sung) was able to dictate terms without moving much, and I had to break that rhythm of hers,"" Sindhu, who will now face Japan‚Äôs Manami Suizu in the second round, said.Soon after the chat, Sindhu changed the tempo and started hitting powerful ground strokes which caught Sung off guard.

NEW DELHI: It was a day of heartbreaks for quite a few Indian shuttlers, and the fans, at the KD Jadhav Indoor Stadium here on Wednesday. Despite the loudest cheers and unequivocal backing from the spectators, some of the top names of Indian badminton suffered shocking first-round exits from the India Open Super 750 tournament.Paris Olympics semifinalist Lakshya Sen crashed out of the men‚Äôs singles event after a 21-15, 21-10 loss against Lin Chun-Yi of Chinese Taipei. Lakshya, 12th in the world rankings, lost to world No. 15 Lin in just 37 minutes. World No. 26 HS Prannoy fought for an hour and 13 minutes, but couldn‚Äôt prevent a 21-16, 18-21, 12-21 loss to Su Li Yang of Chinese Taipei.This was Prannoy‚Äôs second loss in as many matches against Su Li Yang, having previously come up short at the All England Open last year. Prannoy started the match on a positive note and hit some delectable winners much to the de -light of the Indian fans. But Su came back in the second game, forcing some un -forced errors from Prannoy at crucial junctures.In the final game, Prannoy looked clearly tired as Su wrapped up the match in a jiffy. Youngster Priyanshu Rajawat battled valiantly and even saved a match point in the second game before going down fighting 16-21, 22-20, 13-21 against sixth seed Kodai Naraoka of Japan.Rajawat employed big jump smashes to keep pace with Naroaka, making the Japanese work hard for every point, but Naraoka‚Äôs experience counted in the end.Another young gun, Malvika Bansod, played her heart out against China‚Äôs Han Yue, the third seed. Malvika managed to eke out the first game from Han, but the Chinese upped the ante in the next two to win 20-22, 21-16, 21-11.In an all-Indian clash between two Gopichand Academy trainees, Anupama Upadhyaya and Rakshita Sree, the former prevailed 21-17, 21-18 in 43 minutes. The match turned out to be a battle of wits between two good friends with experience triumphing over youth. Anupama, a former national champion, will now face Japanese sixth seed Tomaka Miyazaki in the second round.‚ÄúThis is my first time playing in the India Open Super 750 level. Last year, I was just watching all of them play. Before this, I had played in the Super 500 but the standard at this level is different. Last year, I played my first 750 in China and last week also played the Malaysia Super 1000. These performances help me believe that I can be their equal. I have the speed and compatibility to compete against the top players,‚Äù Anupama said after her win.Among the foreign stars, Olympic champion Viktor Axelsen fought back from a game down to beat Chi Yu Jen of Chinese Taipei 16-21, 21-11, 21-13 in a men‚Äôs singles first round match, while fellow Paris Olympics champion An Se Young of South Korea defeated Chiu Pin-Chian of Chinese Taipei 22-20, 21-15 in the women‚Äôs singles first round.Also advancing to the next round were seventh seeded women‚Äôs doubles combination of Ashwini Ponnappa and Tanisha Crasto, Rutuparna Panda and Swetaparna Panda and the mixed doubles combination of Ashith Surya and Amruta Pramuthesh.Ashwini and Tanisha defeated com -patriots Kavya Gupta and Radhika Sharma 21-11, 21-12, while the Panda sisters got the better of the young Thai combination of Phattarin Aiamvarees -risakul and Sarisa Janpeng 7-21, 21-19, 21-14.

GRV

recalls his famous 97 at Madras that gave India a 100-run win over the West Indies

I don't think I've ever seen a batsman who could deceive the point fielder. He was such a brilliant player off the toe, there are very few people I've seen playing that stroke. In that match (in 1975), there was a lot of uneven bounce, and the batsmen were struggling. But not Vishy. He was playing like it was tennis ball cricket. EAS PRASANNA

He was such a brilliant stroke-maker. We played without helmets. Also, the wickets were not covered. He was a fearless and gifted batsman. BRIJESH PATEL

People in Chennai still talk about the 97 n.o by GRV in 1975. I think it is one of the most talked about subjects in cricket. It was a joy to watch him, and a dream come true to play alongside him. ROGER BINNY

Whenever Vishy bhai scored runs they were match-defining innings and India won those games. I grew up listening to my uncle speaking about the repertoire of Vishy bhai's strokes. VVS LAXMAN

BENGALURU: Of the 6,080 runs that came off his blade, GR Vishwanath 's unbeaten 97 against the West Indies in Chennai (then Madras) on Jan 11, 1975, overshadows all else -- over his 14 centuries, and even his highest score, the 222 against England at the same venue in 1982.Such is the enduring impact of that innings that GRV, in his autobiography 'Wrist Assured', writes, ""Every time I go to Chennai, all I hear about is the 97 not out. Sometimes I feel that is the only worthwhile innings that I have played.""That innings, spread over 228 testing minutes, is testimony to GRV's greatness, an essay of immense grit. Wednesday marked the 50th anniversary of that famous 100-run victory over Clive Llyod's ferocious XI.Back in the day, Madras traditionally hosted a match in the second week of January, popularly labelled the Pongal Test. On Tuesday, those who played that match, along with cricketers from other generations came together to celebrate the landmark innings. The gathering was hosted by Vishwanath's family and on the main course was nostalgia. Those who joined were GRV's 1975 team-mates, BS Chandrasekhar, EAS Prasanna and former Karnataka team-mates Roger Binny and Brijesh Patel. VVS Laxman and Anil Kumble completed the glittering line-up.With his inimitable straight-faced humour, GRV regaled the audience with tales from the match, the era of facing ferocious pacers without the security of a helmet and the camaraderie in the Indian dressing room of a bygone era.It is folklore how the late Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, whose eyesight was failing, decided to lead the team. His confidence stemmed from GRV's prowess with the willow and the ability of his spinners. GRV spoke on the contribution of India's spin trio - Bishan Singh Bedi, Prasanna and Chandrasekhar, Pataudi's acumen as captain, and the crucial 80 by Anshuman Gaekwad in the second essay.Opting to bat, India were in no time reduced to 76/6 with pace merchant Andy Roberts breathing fire. ""By the time I realized what was happening, I saw Karsan Ghavri (No. 8) at the crease,"" said GRV, ""I asked him, 'What's happening here?' He said most of them were back in the dressing room. I looked up at the scoreboard and saw the score was 76. I thought, 'Okay, it's time to play some shots.' I had already played a few and felt good. I decided to go ahead. It so happened that whatever I played, worked. I thought to myself, 'It looks like my day. So, I don't want to stop now.' In between two wickets fell.""At 169/9, the last men standing were GRV and Chandrasekar. For 38 minutes, the spinner had survived the pace onslaught of Roberts, Bernard Julien, Keith Boyce and Vanburn Holder and scored one run.On 96, GRV cut Roberts towards the boundary.""I thought the timing of my cut shot was brilliant. Boyce was in the third-man region, and I told myself, 'No chance will Boyce or his father stop the ball.' I was heading towards Chandra to thank him for his support when I saw the panicked look on his face and ball in Boyce's hand,"" remembered GRV.Chandra was left to face Roberts. He recalled the moments, ""Vishy walked up to me and told me that Roberts would bowl a bouncer. I was preparing for it when Roberts, on his way to his run-up mark, looked back and glared at me. That simply unnerved me.""GRV retorted good-naturedly, ""Who asked him to look at the bowler?""""When Roberts started his run-up, I moved towards the forward short leg and tapped the leg-cutter which curled away. Lloyd took the catch at first slip and that was the end of it,"" said Chandrasekar.India were bowled out for 190, but history still awaited Pataudi's men. GRV hit a patient 46 in India's second innings, Prasanna took 9-111 in the match and Bedi claimed six wickets for a famous win.""I've scored 100s with many strokes. All those strokes came in one inning,"" remembered a modest Indian hero, half a century later.","GR Viswanath's unbeaten 97 against the West Indies in Chennai (then Madras) on Jan 11, 1975, overshadows all else.

It is still early stages of the tournament; we will dust ourselves off and look forward to the next ones. We would like our dot balls to be a lot lower than 70 balls so we will try to minimise that. We know this game can change quickly, so we get a day off tomorrow and we go again.‚ÄùPlayer of the Match David Willey explained his bowling strategy, saying, ‚ÄúI always aim to take wickets and try to swing the new ball to achieve that.

London: Arsenal reignited their Premier League title challenge with a 2-1 victory over Tottenham on Wednesday, while Newcastle secured a spot in the top four thanks to a brace from Alexander Isak.In other matches, David Moyes had a disappointing return to the Everton dugout as his team lost 1-0 to Aston Villa at Goodison Park.The win at the Emirates lifts Arsenal to within four points of league leaders Liverpool, who drew 1-1 with Nottingham Forest on Tuesday, and ended a three-match winless run for the Gunners across all competitions.Tottenham took the lead through Son Heung-min in the 25th minute, but Arsenal equalised 15 minutes later when Gabriel's header from a corner deflected off Dominic Solanke for an own goal.Arsenal completed the turnaround just before halftime, with Leandro Trossard blasting a shot past new Spurs goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky.Despite numerous chances to extend their lead, Arsenal failed to do so and had a nervous moment when Pedro Porro hit the post in stoppage time.Arsenal now sits on 43 points after 21 matches, four points behind Liverpool, who have a game in hand.Mikel Arteta, the Arsenal manager, praised his team's performance, calling it ""outstanding.""""We had some big chances and big situations. At the end we had to suffer more than we wanted,"" he told the BBC.""When you have opportunities (to close the gap) you have to take them. We are on a really consistent run in the Premier League. It's about recovery tomorrow and Aston Villa on Saturday, going and going.""The defeat is another setback for injury-plagued Tottenham, who have taken only five points from their last nine Premier League games and have fallen to 13th in the table.Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou was critical of his team's performance, saying, ""Nowhere near good enough, especially in the first half. We were too passive.""Newcastle moved into fourth place, ahead of struggling Chelsea, with a 3-0 victory over Wolves, thanks to a record-chasing performance from Isak, who scored for the eighth consecutive league match.Isak's deflected shot off Wolves defender Rayan Ait-Nouri put Newcastle ahead in the 34th minute, and he doubled the lead before the hour mark with his 15th league goal of the season.Anthony Gordon added a third goal for Newcastle.""I feel amazing,"" said Isak, who has Jamie Vardy's record of scoring in 11 straight Premier League games in his sights.""Individually I feel free and confident but looking at the team we are doing so well as well, defending and with threats going forward. It is a team and I have to keep contributing with goals.""At Goodison Park, Ollie Watkins scored the only goal for Aston Villa in the 51st minute, slotting past England teammate Jordan Pickford after being sent through by Morgan Rogers.Despite their efforts, Everton lacked creativity, which is unsurprising for a team that has scored only 15 league goals in 20 matches this season.The result lifts Aston Villa to seventh in the table, while Everton remain in deep trouble, just one point above the relegation zone in 16th place.Everton, who have been in the top flight since 1954, have struggled against relegation for the past three seasons and are once again in a perilous position.David Moyes, who enjoyed success during his 11-year stint at Goodison Park from 2002 to 2013, was brought back by Everton's new American owners, the Friedkin Group, after they sacked Sean Dyche last week.""Obviously it's been a bit of a whirlwind,"" Moyes said. ""Sean Dyche left a group of players that have great character and a great attitude.""I'm really pleased to take over that. What I need to do is add quality and find a way of getting results but you can't change the whole thing around straight away.""In another match, Leicester suffered their sixth consecutive league defeat, losing 2-0 to Crystal Palace, which leaves them second from bottom in the table.Jean-Philippe Mateta scored for Palace early in the second half, and Marc Guehi secured the points with a late second goal.","Arsenal beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 to move within four points of Premier League leaders Liverpool.

Liverpool 's charge towards the Premier League title was halted by stubborn Nottingham Forest in a 1-1 draw between the top two on Tuesday as Manchester City 's resurgence came undone in a 2-2 draw at Brentford.Chris Wood fired Forest in front early on at a raucous City Ground, but Liverpool dominated almost the entire 97 minutes and got back on level terms thanks to substitute Diogo Jota's goal with his first touch.Only a brilliant goalkeeping performance from Matz Sels denied the leaders victory, but the point maintained a six-point cushion over Forest for Arne Slot's men, who also have a game in hand.Forest had won their last seven games in all competitions to raise the possibility of matching Leicester's incredible title win of 2015/16.The in-form Wood had the home fans believing after just eight minutes when he slotted in Anthony Elanga's pass.Liverpool enjoyed over 70 percent possession and had 23 shots on goal but only posed a serious threat in front of goal after the break.Jota had only been on the field a matter of seconds when he nodded in Kostas Tsimikas' corner.Sels then made incredible saves to deny Jota, Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo a winner, while Salah also had a goalbound effort cleared off the line.""I could not have asked for more,"" said Slot. ""Second half was outstanding.""There are not many teams that can create so many chances against an opponent so defensively strong. Unfortunately we couldn't get a second.""Liverpool's second consecutive league draw opens the door for Arsenal to cut the gap at the top to four points when they host Tottenham in the north London derby on Wednesday.Any suggestion City could get themselves back in the title race was ended in a late collapse in west London as Brentford struck twice in the final 10 minutes for a deserved point.Phil Foden's double had City on course for a fourth consecutive win after a run of just one victory in 13 games.However, the English champions' defending was not convincing all night and they were punished as Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard netted for the Bees.Foden's return to the form that saw him crowned Premier League player of the year last season was the one positive for City.But Pep Guardiola will reflect on a missed opportunity to make up ground on the top four as City remain down in sixth, 12 points off the top.Foden produced a brilliant deft touch from Kevin De Bruyne's inviting delivery and then smashed in a rebound for his fourth goal in five league games.Brentford wasted a host of chances before conceding but finally got some reward for their attacking endeavour when Wissa slotted in from Mads Roerslev's cross to become the club's all-time leading goalscorer in the Premier League.They completed the comeback in stoppage time when Norgaard's header had too much power for Stefan Ortega.""We are not (at our best) and we didn't take the right decisions,"" said Guardiola. ""It's fine, it's not a good place to come. Unfortunately, we couldn't win.""Fourth-placed Chelsea's miserable run extended to five league games without a win but they were grateful for captain Reece James' stoppage-time equaliser salvaging a point in a 2-2 draw at home to Bournemouth.Cole Palmer's cool finish from Nicolas Jackson's through ball had given Chelsea the perfect start.But Bournemouth hit back through Justin Kluivert's penalty, before Antoine Semenyo's blistering near-post effort put the visitors in front.James has endured another injury-hit season but showed his quality by curling home a free-kick at the death.West Ham boss Graham Potter enjoyed a winning home debut as Fulham were beaten 3-2 at the London Stadium.Carlos Soler, Tomas Soucek and Lucas Paqueta were on target for the Hammers to take Potter's men above Manchester United and Tottenham into 12th.",Liverpool held to 1-1 draw by Nottingham Forest at the City Ground.

Conceicao success

Milan: Atalanta creeped closer to Serie A leaders Napoli on Tuesday after drawing an entertaining match with Juventus 1-1 and moving to within four points of the summit, while AC Milan came from behind to beat Como.Mateo Retegui salvaged a point for Atalanta with a close-range header 12 minutes from time, not long after returning to action from the bench following four weeks on the sidelines with a hamstring injury.The Italy striker's finish, which levelled Pierre Kalulu's 54th-minute opener for Juve, put him out on his own at the top of the Serie A scoring charts on 13 goals and pushed Atalanta to 43 points, ahead of table-topping Napoli's crucial trip to Bergamo this coming weekend.Gian Piero Gasperini's side, who are bidding for their first league title after winning the Europa League last season, sit level on points with second-placed Inter Milan.However, champions Inter have two games in hand on both Atalanta and Napoli and play the first of those fixtures against Bologna at the San Siro on Wednesday.""It was a great match tonight, and I'm very happy with the way my boys played,"" said Gasperini to Sky.""It was difficult going behind because we were hoping to go ahead but I think at the end of the day a draw is probably a fair result.""Tuesday's draw was Atalanta and Juve's rescheduled fixture due to their trip to Saudi Arabia to contest the Italian Super Cup earlier this month with Inter and winners AC Milan.Juve were again without a recognised striker due to an injury crisis which has left both Dusan Vlahovic and Arkadiusz Milik sidelined but Thiago Motta's side were a constant threat.Moments before his opener Kalulu watched on in frustration as his glancing header hit the inside of the post and was just scooped off the line by Atalanta goalkeeper Marco Carnesecchi.And Kenan Yildiz put wide a great chance to snatch a last-gasp win deep in stoppage time, shortly after substitute Nicolo Zaniolo slapped a golden opportunity for the hosts straight at Juve goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio.""To draw like that in the closing minutes hurts a bit. We played well and had the chances to win today,"" said Kalulu.Juve remain unbeaten but have now drawn 13 of their 20 league fixtures and sit fifth, 13 points behind Napoli.Earlier, Theo Hernandez and Rafael Leao saved Milan from an embarrassing defeat at Como with the goals which gave Sergio Conceicao's new team a 2-1 win.Trailing to Assane Diao's fine low strike on the hour mark, star players Hernandez and Leao turned the match around by the 76th minute, handing Conceicao his first league win as Milan coach.Tuesday's victory in one of their two games in hand moved Milan up to seventh on 31 points, five behind fourth-placed Lazio as Conceicao tries to reignite the Italian giants' bid for Champions League qualification.""They (Como) are a good team with a good coach, it's not easy to play here,"" said Conceicao.""It was an even game but we can't concede as much as we did, we need to be more organised.""Left flank pairing Hernandez and Leao had reportedly been at loggerheads with Conceicao's predecessor Paulo Fonseca, who was sacked at the end of December following a dismal opening half of the season.Both praised their new coach after he arrived just before the new year and immediately won the Super Cup for Milan, who came from two goals behind to beat Inter in Saudi Arabia earlier this month.Hernandez levelled for Milan 11 minutes after Como new boy Diao's opener when his mishit volley sliced off his left boot and looped past goalkeeper Jean Butez.Leao dinked home the decisive goal shortly afterwards, meeting substitute Tammy Abraham's excellent through ball before netting his seventh goal in all competitions.",Atalanta draw 1-1 with Juventus in Serie A.

Sadaoui netted the winner in the 90+5th minute, having earlier provided the assist for Jesus Jimenez 's strike in the 73rd minute.The match sprang to life as soon as it started, with Odisha FC taking an early advantage through Mawihmingthanga's goal in the fourth minute. A clearance from Odisha's half landed in the Blasters' penalty area. Despite the ball bouncing in front of Pritam Kotal, the Indian international hesitated and failed to make a proper clearance. Odisha's striker Dorielton Nascimento capitalised on the defensive error and directed a header towards Mawihmingthanga, who gently guided the ball past Sachin Suresh to put the visitors ahead.After falling behind, Blasters launched numerous attacks on the Odisha goalmouth, clearly controlling the latter part of the first half and the initial minutes of the second half. Their persistence paid off in the 60th minute. Korou Singh, who was positioned in the attacking third, surprisingly retreated to the midfield, catching the Odisha defence off guard. He then provided Kwame Peprah with a precise pass from the right of the centre line, splitting two Odisha defenders. Peprah, left with only goalkeeper Amrinder Singh to beat, slotted the ball skilfully to draw the scores level.Soon after the equaliser, Blasters strengthened their strike force by substituting defender Alexandre Coeff with striker Jesus Jimenez. This tactical change proved beneficial for the hosts when Jimenez put Blasters ahead in the 73rd minute. Luna delivered a cross from the right flank to Sadaoui positioned near the far post, who directed a header towards Jimenez. The striker simply extended his foot to guide the ball into the net, securing a 2-1 lead for Blasters.Odisha managed to level the score when Dorielton Nascimento converted a rebound in the 80th minute. However, Odisha's fortunes took a turn for the worse when Carlos Delgado, who entered as a substitute in the 66th minute, received his second yellow card in the 82nd minute for consecutive fouls, reducing his team to ten players.Blasters made the numerical superiority count when Sadaoui found the back of the net during stoppage time. His strike from inside the penalty box took a fortunate deflection off Rahim Ali and looped into the net to give Blasters a much-needed victory.","Noah Sadaoui netted the winner in the 90+5th minute, having earlier provided the assist for Jesus Jimenez's strike in the 73rd minute.

Coaching The Fundamental

Since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, Manchester United fans ‚Äì particularly those who reached adolescence when the Class of 1992 made the first-team cut ‚Äì have channelled their inner Ronin (Hawkeye‚Äôs murderous avatar into beg the team not to give hope. Over the years, there have been numerous false dawns, slivers of light ahead of the tunnel that have made United fans dream again before they were snatched away, like Morpheus‚Äô Nebuchadnezzar‚Äôs lament: ‚ÄúI had a dream, but the dream was taken from me.‚ÄùThere was the Van Gaal era where fans were convinced that a former tactician ‚Äì a man some claim invented modern football ‚Äì could bring United back to the glory years. Then they convinced themselves that the Special One, by sheer dint of willpower and personality (and a little bit of the dark arts), the fallen Lucifer to Pep Guardiola‚Äôs Michael, would be the right person to resuscitate the Red Devils. They almost persuaded themselves, when Ole was at the wheel, that the good times were rolling again. It certainly felt like that on that night in Paris and when United were playing like the Fergie teams of yore. They even dared to hope that a man named Eric would lead the charge again, much like the collared Frenchman who did it in the early Fergie years.And now, Ruben Amorim, the youngest Man Utd manager in half a century, is playing the Pandora‚Äôs Box‚Äôs old trick again. Of course, on paper, Amorim‚Äôs record is nothing to write home about. His record in his first 13 games reads: five wins, two draws and six losses. Most other Man Utd managers actually have better records. Sir Alex Ferguson‚Äôs read: three wins, seven draws and three losses. It‚Äôs what came after those 13 games that makes Manchester United fans believe.But there has been something of the old grit that defined Fergie teams that has Utd fans daring to hope again. The back-to-the-wall performance evoked an older Man Utd vs Arsenal clash: the epic 1999 replay.The similarities are astounding between the 1999 FA Cup semi-final replay and the 2025 third-round showdown between the two clubs.The only difference in the 2025 match was that it was decided on penalty shootouts and not a wondrous Ryan Giggs goal that made Maradona look up from his cocaine pile.And in a strange way, it was a mirror image of the 2005 FA Cup final with its infamous Band of Brothers viral image featuring Paul Scholes, Roy Keane, Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney , Ryan Giggs, Mika√´l Silvestre and Quinton Fortune.Incidentally, Manchester United battered Arsenal in that match ‚Äì a follow-up to the infamous 4-2 ‚ÄúI will see you out there‚Äù Highbury fight ‚Äì but still lost on a penalty shootout with Paul Scholes missing the last penalty. That day, United had eight shots on target, 12 off target, and 12 corners (far more than Arsenal) but still lost.It was a different ballgame in 2025. Arsenal had 26 shots to Man Utd‚Äôs seven, 71% of the possession, and a 3.3 xG to United‚Äôs 1.1 but failed to make their mark. United players have been struggling to adapt to Ruben Amorim‚Äôs style, but against Arsenal (like they did against Manchester City and Liverpool), there was a slight glimpse of the taste in the pudding.In the cult classic Coach Carter ‚Äì when Samuel L. Jackson was whipping a bunch of askew young men into shape ‚Äì he was asked by his team what they should do since they hadn‚Äôt practised attacking. To this, Jackson‚Äôs Carter had said: ‚ÄúRun.‚Äù And that‚Äôs what United players did in the match, all of them running together as a pack to keep Arsenal at bay.Harry Maguire, often the pantomime villain on the football pitch and even in parliaments around the world, was a colossus in defence. Equally driven were Lisandro Mart√≠nez and Matthijs de Ligt, the latter finally learning how to operate in a three-man midfield.Of course, Arsenal‚Äôs inability to finish was one of the major reasons this match went to penalties, with Kai Havertz moved around the pitch like Roy Keane was screaming ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt score in a brothel!‚Äù in his ear.But United fans will rejoice at the grit from a team that, during the last days of the Ten Hag era, looked like they were simply not interested in playing football. Whether it was Bayindir‚Äôs redemption after the horror performance against Tottenham in the Carabao Cup, academy graduate Toby Collyer‚Äôs gut-bursting runs, Bruno‚Äôs Roy Keane impression or Noussair Mazraoui and Manuel Ugarte in midfield, this was a team effort.And the performance came against refereeing that launched a thousand memes about Arsenal players diving with abandon, which included a soft penalty and a red card.A swallow doesn‚Äôt make a summer, and Manchester United will probably have to suffer for many more years before they finally have a team worthy of cleaning the boots of any of the vintage Ferguson teams. But for the moment, United fans can at least hope that the current side, even if they lack the sheer world-class talent of the Band of Brothers or the 1999 winning team or any of the great Fergie teams, will give it their all every time they are wearing the United shirt.Next up in the FA Cup: Ruud van Nistelrooy‚Äôs Leicester City, the last interim manager of Manchester United and a man who knows a thing or two about the gigantic expectations that come with wearing the Manchester United shirt.",Manchester United lost 3-2 to Arsenal in the 2025 FA Cup third round. The match was a mirror image of the epic 1999 FA Cup semi-final replay.

In an alarming coincidence, each of their three home losses in this ISL campaign have come by that very scoreline.In a game that took until the second half to come to life, it was Mohammed Sanan who set the visitors on their way in the 64th minute with a clinical finish.Just as Mumbai City so nearly drew level when Nikolaos Karelis's left-footed effort stung Albino Gomes's palms in the closing minutes, Jordan Murray (86th) sealed the three points for Khalid Jamil's side following a quick break after Jamshedpur had won back possession.There was time for one final dagger which arrived in stoppage time as Javi Hernandez (90+6) fired home from inside the box.The win saw Jamshedpur climb to third place, level on points with Bengaluru (27pts) with a game in hand. Mumbai, meanwhile, still occupy sixth spot and that final playoff berth, but were left to rue another bitter outing at home. Although they went into this game with a confidence-boosting 3-2 win at East Bengal last week, there is no doubt that the Islanders are finding goals hard to come by this season.Coach Petr Kratky has even resorted to switching captain Lallianzuala Chhangte from his favoured position on the right of their usual three-man attack to playing in the hole behind the front three.It would yield no dividends on this occasion, as Jamshedpur's backline were disciplined enough to deal with anything Karelis, Vikram Partap Singh or Bipin Singh were able to ask of them.To make matters worse, Chhangte was sent off after the game for dissent.","Jamshedpur beat Mumbai City 0-3 at the Mumbai Football Arena.

Altay Bayindir was the unexpected hero for Manchester United as they edged past Arsenal in a dramatic FA Cup encounter at the Emirates. The match ended 1-1 after 90 minutes, and United triumphed 5-4 on penalties, with Bayindir making crucial saves both in normal time and during the shootout to send the holders into the fourth round.United took the lead early in the second half when Bruno Fernandes unleashed a thunderous strike into the top corner, capitalising on a slip by Gabriel after Alejandro Garnacho's incisive run. However, the game turned when Diogo Dalot received a second yellow card on the hour mark for a reckless challenge, leaving United to defend with 10 men for over half an hour.Arsenal wasted no time exploiting their numerical advantage as Gabriel Magalh√£es scored the equaliser, with Bayindir failing to deal with Gabriel Martinelli‚Äôs cross, resulting in a deflected shot finding the net.Despite dominating possession and creating multiple chances, Arsenal failed to capitalise. Their woes were compounded when Bayindir saved Martin Odegaard‚Äôs penalty following a controversial decision against Harry Maguire, who was furious at the call and clashed with Kai Havertz during the ensuing melee.Bayindir redeemed himself further with a stunning stop to deny Declan Rice and another to keep Havertz at bay as Arsenal squandered golden opportunities to secure the win in regulation.In the penalty shootout, United were flawless. Fernandes, Amad Diallo, Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez, and Josua Zirkzee all converted their spot-kicks, with Zirkzee calmly scoring the decisive penalty. Bayindir‚Äôs save against Havertz in the shootout proved pivotal, capping a remarkable performance for the Turkish goalkeeper.The defeat deepens Arsenal‚Äôs recent struggles, coming on the back of a League Cup semi-final first-leg loss to Newcastle. Manager Mikel Arteta expressed his frustration, stating, ""We deserved to win based on performance, but the reality is we‚Äôre out.""Arsenal‚Äôs misery was compounded by the sight of Gabriel Jesus being stretchered off in the first half with a suspected knee injury, adding to their growing list of absentees.For United, the win was a testament to their resilience under manager Ruben Amorim, who praised his side‚Äôs character in a hard-fought victory. The holders now face Leicester City in the fourth round, with the added storyline of Ruud van Nistelrooy , a United legend, returning to Old Trafford as Leicester‚Äôs manager.",Manchester United beat Arsenal 5-4 on penalties in the FA Cup third round.

Siegemund shock:

Mensik powers through:

Late in the 32-minute opening set, perhaps during the changeover when staring at an emphatic 0-5 scoreline, Naomi Osaka 's vivid sunflower hair clips came off.It might've helped untether the Japanese's fierce groundstrokes as she won 18 of the next 23 games against Czech Karolina Muchova , who she had lost successive meetings to, most recently in New York, to move into the third round of a major for the first time since January 2022.Osaka, the two-time Melbourne Park champion, rallied from a set down to defeat the 20th seed 1-6, 6-1, 6-3 on Wednesday.The 27-year-old, who recently announced on social media that she and rapper boyfriend Cordae had parted ways, sported the sunflower theme, in her hair, ears and shoes, underlining the look was fitting for the Happy Slam.""I don't know if anyone was able to take a very zoomed-in picture of my shoes, but on the side it says, 'The sun shines where you are',"" she said of her tangerine-hued lace-ups, with sunflower accents in the front. ""It was fitting to have a sunny theme (for here).""Osaka's gear contrasted the fickle Melbourne weather ‚Äì dank and dismal; the crowd responded to it, getting into the contest from the get-go. Every cheer for Osaka was met with 'Do toho!' for the Muchova, 'go for it' in Czech, particularly in the decider when she trailed 2-5.The Japanese bounced up and down as she watched the ball sail long on her third match point after 1-hour and 57-minutes of riveting action.After pulling off what she called a 'revenge win' Osaka proceeded to school the full-house, saying 'revenge was competitive and a good thing'.The Osaka-Muchova match played on KIA Arena with a seating of 5000 as against the courts the four-time major winner is generally scheduled on like the Rod Laver Arena with a 15000 capacity waltzed to the tune of the crowd, who were fully involved in the contest, with fair support for both players.""I don't really mind,"" Osaka said of the size of the court. ""I think I'm the type of person that tries to focus on themselves a lot when playing, but I really did enjoy the crowd today. So if that's because it was a smaller court, then maybe I do enjoy smaller courts.""Next up for Osaka is another 27-year-old mother Swiss Belinda Bencic, a former top-5, presently ranked 294. Bencic, whose daughter will turn one in April, leads their head-to-head 3-2.""I love playing the big opponents, that's where I play my best tennis ,"" said Osaka, who put out Frenchwoman Caroline Garcia in the first round. ""If I play better opponents as the rounds go on, it's more interesting because I feel like it's like the clash of Titans almost. I think the fans probably appreciate it.""Osaka, who has been outspoken on a number of issues, said she was an athlete first and mother next when on the court.""We are labelled 'moms,' of course. I think when you go on the tennis court, you just think of yourself as a tennis player,"" she said. ""I don't want to say I've grown up with her (Bencic), but we've definitely seen each other on Tour. I think it's really cool that she also had a baby, and she came back, as well.""It wasn't the best of days for China's fifth seed Zheng Qinwen who fell 6-7 (3), 3-6 to the spirited Laura Siegemund. The German authored the tournament's first major upset.Olympic gold medallist Zheng came into the event as a possible title contender at a career-high ranking of No.5, but the defence and defiance of the World No.97 Siegemund won out in 2 hours and 16 minutes of play.Some 24-hours after Brazil's 18-year-old Joao Fonseca knocked out the world No.9 Andrey Rublev, 19-year-old Czech Jakub Mensik put out the sixth seeded Casper Ruud 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 firing 62 winners to reach the third round.Mensik, who hit 22 aces, sparked the Margaret Court Arena where he clinched the win in 2-hours and 44-minutes.","Osaka, the two-time Melbourne Park champion, rallied from a set down to defeat the 20th seed.

Katie Boulter and Alex de Minaur spark couple vibes at Melbourne Park,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/australian-open/katie-boulter-and-alex-de-minaur-spark-couple-vibes-at-melbourne-park/articleshow/117270380.cms,"(Agency Photo)

Katie Boulter and Alex de Minaur have been dating for five years, as of December they were engaged, and at Melbourne Park they are sparking couple vibes.Shortly after clinching his first-round win over Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp, De Minaur, the world No. 8, raced to the KIA Arena to watch the deciding set of Boulter's first-round clash against Canada's Rebecca Marino.Boulter, the world No.25, was in a spot of bother after losing the second set but turned around the match with the Aussie No.1 cheering at courtside.""Having Alex there, he is my support system,"" Boulter said. ""He has helped me through the rough and good moments. He kind of leads me, I would say. He has shown what an incredible tennis player he is and he's ranked top 10 in the world and has been there for a whole year, which is not an easy thing to do.""""Having him come out and support me means pretty much everything to me. Having that extra positivity from my bench makes the difference,"" the 28-year-old Briton said.Boulter's scores kept flashing on Rod Laver Arena when the Sydney-born De Minaur was on court.""It is tough just because there is a scoreboard that keeps alternating with different results throughout the day, and then all of a sudden you get the score of Katie's match,"" he said. ""You try not to pay too much attention and focus on yourself, but the fact that it's always coming around makes it difficult.""Boulter, 28 from Leicester, wished she could see De Minaur's score when she was playing.""It's obviously difficult knowing he's playing a match and you're kind of hearing cheers here and there and you're hoping that's for him, but you never know,"" she said. ""Look I'm fully focused on what I'm doing, most of the time I'm not thinking about it at all, but of course I'm hoping he wins and that he's out there for the rest of my match!""In Thursday's second-round action, De Minaur takes on American qualifier Tristan Boyer, second match on Rod Laver Arena. On Court No.3, an adjacent show court, Boulter plays Veronica Kudermetova, in the fourth match. The Aussie can make it comfortably for Boulter's engagement.","Katie Boulter and Alex de Minaur have been dating for five years, as of December they were engaged, and at Melbourne Park they are sparking couple vibes.
