Chennai Super Kings:

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings snapped their five-match losing streak in the Indian Premier League 2025 with a much-needed five-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants at the Ekana Stadium on Monday. Despite the morale-boosting result, CSK remain at the bottom of the points table with just four points from seven matches.Opting to bowl first, CSK restricted LSG to 166 for 7, thanks to disciplined efforts from their bowlers. Rishabh Pant led the way for Lucknow with a fighting 63 off 49 balls, including four fours and four sixes, while Mitchell Marsh contributed 30 off 25 balls at the top.Ravindra Jadeja starred with the ball, picking up 2 for 24 in three overs, while seamers Khaleel Ahmed and Anshul Kamboj chipped in with early breakthroughs.In reply, CSK were wobbling at 111 for 5 after a solid start from Rachin Ravindra (37 off 22). But Shivam Dube held his nerve with a patient 43* off 37 balls. He found a perfect ally in MS Dhoni, who turned back the clock with a blistering 26* off 11 deliveries, sealing the win with three balls to spare. The two added a match-winning 57-run partnership in 4.3 overs.Youngster Shaik Rasheed also made an impression on debut with a handy 27 off 19 balls, providing CSK some middle-order stability.This win, while important for CSK’s confidence, does little to change their position at the foot of the table. Lucknow Super Giants, despite the loss, remain fourth with 8 points from seven matches and are still in the playoff mix.166/7 in 20 overs (Rishabh Pant 63; Ravindra Jadeja 2/24).168/5 in 19.3 overs (Rachin Ravindra 37, MS Dhoni 26 not out, Shivam Dube 43 not out; Ravi Bishnoi 2/18).","Chennai Super Kings snap five-match losing streak with five-wicket win.

Matthew Tkachuk Injury Update: A Boost for Panthers Before Playoffs

Florida Panthers aim to bring momentum into another deep run in the playoffs



Based on the latest report from ESPN commentator Kevin Weekes , Florida Panthers forward Matthew Tkachuk might return in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs . The 27-year-old winger has been out since February with a lower-body injury that he picked up during the 4 Nations Face-Off , depriving the Florida Panthers of one of their most important scoring weapons during the last stretch of the regular season.Matthew Tkachuk's absence has been felt keenly on and off the ice, but with playoffs just days away, fans had been holding their collective breath waiting for any word regarding his status. And now, as the Florida Panthers look to make another postseason push, that long-awaited word at last arrived—on good terms.Veteran NHL insider and ESPN analyst Kevin Weekes broke the news that Matthew Tkachuk is leaning towards a return for the Florida Panthers for Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. The news, first disseminated by Kevin Weekes and built upon by Florida-centric podcast ‘Panther Pourri’, has renewed hope among fans, especially after comments from head coach Paul Maurice, where he stated Matthew Tkachuk's return is ‘a ways away’.That pronouncement is a huge vote of confidence for Florida Panthers supporters who have watched Matthew Tkachuk skate on his own but still be nowhere to be found at the team's practices. The franchise's face man has been given medical guidance not only from team doctors but also doctors abroad, suggesting his determination to be in top form when the playoffs continue.During last month's 4 Nations Face-Off, the forward sustained an injury while representing the United States. He did not play against Sweden on February 17 after missing the last 12:36 of the third period against Canada on February 15.The Florida Panthers have already qualified for the playoffs and are riding high on confidence after dominating the previous two seasons.

World Reacts To Kyren Lacy's Death

The Fallout: LSU player dead amid public scrutiny



The painful reality of Kyren Lacy’s death



Kyren Lacy , a promising LSU wide receiver with dreams of an NFL career, is dead at 24. The news has rocked the sports world, leaving fans and players alike questioning: How did Kyren die? Lacy’s tragic passing follows a series of legal battles that tainted his once-spotless reputation, including charges of negligent homicide stemming from a fatal crash. As details emerge about the LSU football player’s struggles, his death serves as a painful reminder of the harsh realities facing young athletes under immense pressure.How did Kyren die? The answer traces back to a devastating chain of events that began months earlier. Kyren Lacy was no ordinary LSU football player—his explosive talent made him one of the most talked-about prospects ahead of the 2025 NFL Draft. But in December 2024, everything changed. Lacy was involved in a fatal car crash on LA Highway 20 while driving a 2023 Dodge Charger. Authorities say he was speeding and illegally passing vehicles when he collided with 78-year-old Army veteran Herman Hall, who tragically lost his life. Lacy faced multiple serious charges, including negligent homicide, felony hit-and-run, and reckless operation of a vehicle.The aftermath of the crash was nothing short of a nightmare for Lacy. As the LSU football player faced mounting legal troubles, he became the target of media scrutiny. His arrest and the circulation of his mugshot painted a grim picture, and the young athlete was quickly judged in the court of public opinion.Despite the chaos surrounding him, Lacy kept fighting to maintain his NFL dreams. He participated in LSU’s Pro Day in March 2025, showcasing his skills to NFL scouts. But with the weight of the charges looming over him, it seemed as if Lacy’s future in football was slipping away. Then came the devastating news: Kyren Lacy passed away in Houston, with sources suggesting suicide as the likely cause. The LSU football community was left in shock, with questions swirling about how the immense pressure of the legal battle, combined with public judgment, could have led to such a heartbreaking outcome.Lacy’s lawyer has publicly criticized the media and the NFL for their handling of his case, blaming the negative coverage and the lack of support for contributing to his tragic end. In a statement, the lawyer called attention to how the public narrative around Lacy had been shaped before he was even given a chance to defend himself. The statement suggested that the relentless media frenzy played a crucial role in the mental toll that may have led to the LSU player’s death.Also Read: Justin Fields and the Jets: Why the search for long-term quarterback isn’t over Kyren Lacy’s death is more than just the loss of an LSU football player, it’s a stark reminder of the immense pressure facing young athletes, especially when their every move is scrutinized by the media.

A goal for the ages: Alex Ovechkin breaks Wayne Gretzky's 26-year record



FULL Alex Ovechkin Celebration Ceremony After Record-Breaking Goal No. 895

A legacy passed down: Anastasia Shubskaya receives diamond tribute from Janet Gretzky



After Alex Ovechkin netted his 895th career goal and broke legendary Wayne Gretzky 's record, Janet Gretzky showed respect to a time-honored hockey tradition by gifting Anastasia Shubskaya , wife of Alex Ovechkin, an eight-carat diamond ring that had been estimated at $280,000. The Capitals may have lost to the New York Islanders by a score of 4-1, but the outcome was an afterthought to a night all about legacy, love, and a new chapter in hockey's history.The moment of history arrived at 7:26 of the second period. Alex Ovechkin let go of a blazing shot through fellow Russian Ilya Sorokin, making himself the NHL's all-time leading goal scorer. Fans inside UBS Arena lost their minds, and Alex Ovechkin commemorated the occasion by executing a belly flop onto the ice—celebrating his big achievement.Alex Ovechkin celebrated this achievement in a pregame ceremony against the Carolina Hurricanes on April 10, 2025. He was given a six-foot sculptural painting by TYP depicting his skates and game-used sticks, with his image on it, with “Most Goals All Time” written on the top and “895 Alex Ovechkin 895” on the bottom.While Alex Ovechkin was absorbing the enormity of his achievement, Anastasia Shubskaya was gifted a symbolic token of the historic night. Continuing a tradition started in 1994, when Colleen Howe (wife of Gordie Howe) gave Janet Gretzky a diamond ring after her husband, Wayne Gretzky, broke Colleen Howe’s husband’s record, Janet Gretzky ensured history repeated itself—this time from one hockey family to another.In an interview with the media, Wayne Gretzky said, “A month ago, my wife said, ‘You know, Colleen Howe started a tradition. I’m not sure if anyone is going to break Alex’s record, but I want to give her (Ovechkin’s wife, Anastasia Shubskaya) something really unique.’ So, we went out and she picked out an eight-diamond ring for Alex’s wife. Not only do hockey guys pass down traditions. So do the families and wives.”The act not only spanned generations of greatness but also underlined the strong relationship between hockey families across generations.Anastasia Shubskaya, who tied the knot with Alex Ovechkin in 2016, is a Russian model who has appeared in numerous Russian magazines during her career and has built a strong social media presence. They are proud parents of two sons- Sergei and Ilya.Shubskaya had posted a cute moment on her Instagram stories when her son intently watched the game while his father was playing, captioning it: ""Tuning in for the game"" with a smiley face.Also read: “Now the real stuff is coming”: Alex Ovechkin skips The Tonight Show appearance to stay playoff-ready Even though the Capitals fell on the evening, the larger context is one of hope. The team had already secured a playoff berth and now has the emotional tailwind of reaching a once-a-generation milestone. With the NHL playoffs coming, Alex Ovechkin and the Washington Capitals aim to ride the wave of history toward what would be a fairy tale conclusion to the 2025 campaign.","Alex Ovechkin scored his 895th goal, surpassing Wayne Gretzky's 26-year record.

Steve Kerr’s late-game play design shatters dreams for many

Social media erupts over Steve Kerr’s flawed choice

""I’d take a 40-foot heave from Steph Curry over a play designed for Buddy Hield with the game on the line. Steve Kerr is the GOAT clown charlatan I’ve ever seen in my life. This guy is literally willing to live and die with Buddy Hield minutes.""

What’s next for the Golden State Warriors?

Thefaced a season-defining moment in overtime against the Los Angeles Clippers, trailing by three with just six seconds left. Instead of putting the ball in the hands of the greatest shooter in NBA history,made a controversial call—using Stephen Curry as a decoy. The decision backfired, leading to a missed three-pointer by Buddy Hield and sealing a loss that pushed the Warriors into the play-in tournament.With the game on the line, Kerr opted for a play that had Curry set a screen at the top of the key. The idea was to draw defensive attention away from Hield, who caught the inbound pass and took the potential game-tying shot. The problem? Hield, who had only eight points on 2-of-5 shooting from deep that night, missed. Meanwhile, Curry—despite playing with a taped-up right thumb—had already dropped 36 points, including seven three-pointers.The Clippers secured the rebound, hit their free throws, and left the Golden State Warriors with no time to recover. The loss not only stung in the moment but also had major playoff implications, forcing Golden State into the play-in instead of securing a direct postseason berth.Fans and analysts didn’t hold back in criticizing Kerr’s decision. One viral post read:Others questioned why Jimmy Butler wasn’t the secondary option if Curry wasn’t taking the shot, though that argument held less weight given Butler’s well-known reluctance to take three-pointers in recent years.The loss leaves the Golden State Warriors with no choice but to regroup and prepare for the play-in tournament, where they’ll face the Memphis Grizzlies . While Curry’s health doesn’t appear to be a major concern—his 36-point performance proved he was still lethal from deep—Kerr’s late-game strategy will remain under scrutiny.Also read: Draymond Green crowns himself NBA Defensive Player of the Year ahead of crucial Golden State Warriors clash - ""I think DPOY should be yours truly!""

Golden State Warriors face Memphis Grizzlies with playoff hopes on the line

Can the Warriors turn play-in struggles into playoff success?

Theare heading into the NBA Play-In Tournament once again, andrecently shared a lighthearted exchange with teammateabout their contrasting fortunes in the tournament.After the Golden State Warriors’ 124-119 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers in their final regular-season game, Stephen Curry was asked how the team’s past Play-In experiences could help this time around. He revealed a recent conversation with Jimmy Butler, who has had far more success in the tournament.Stephen Curry told 95.7 The Game.Butler led the Miami Heat on an improbable run last season, advancing from the Play-In to the NBA Finals. Meanwhile, the Golden State Warriors are 0-3 in the tournament since its inception. Golden State Warriors will first take on the Memphis Grizzlies, with the winner advancing to face the Houston Rockets in the first round. A loss would send them to a do-or-die game against the winner of the Sacramento Kings-Dallas Mavericks matchup, with the Oklahoma City Thunder awaiting the victor.The Warriors had hoped to avoid the Play-In altogether, but the loss to the Clippers sealed their fate. Kawhi Leonard and James Harden delivered in the clutch to secure the win for Los Angeles, who now face the Denver Nuggets in the playoffs.Since acquiring Jimmy Butler at the trade deadline, the Warriors have played with renewed energy. Their experience, including Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, and Butler himself, could prove vital in high-pressure situations.While the Play-In has been unkind to Golden State in the past, Butler’s presence brings hope.

High hopes, poor results for Mike Budenholzer

Phoenix Suns face uncertain offseason

Thehave parted ways with head coachafter just one season, marking the team’s third coaching change in as many years. The decision comes after a disappointing 36-46 season that saw the Suns miss the playoffs entirely despite high expectations.Since Mat Ishbia took over ownership in 2023, the Suns have struggled to find stability in their coaching staff. Monty Williams was fired after a second-round playoff exit, and his replacement, Frank Vogel, lasted only one season before being let go following a first-round sweep. Mike Budenholzer, hired last offseason, now joins that list after failing to turn the team’s fortunes around.In a statement released by the team, the Phoenix Suns acknowledged their shortcomings:Mike Budenholzer, an Arizona native and former NBA champion with the Milwaukee Bucks, was seen as a strong fit for the Suns. Known for managing player minutes and building strong defensive systems, his hiring was expected to address Phoenix’s weaknesses. However, the partnership never clicked.Despite an 8-1 start, the season quickly unraveled. Reports of tension between Budenholzer and star guard Devin Booker surfaced, with Chris Haynes noting in February that the coach had asked Booker to be less vocal. The team’s struggles culminated in an early elimination from playoff contention, sealing Budenholzer’s fate.The coaching change comes at a critical time for Phoenix. Kevin Durant is widely expected to be traded, and Bradley Beal’s future remains uncertain due to his no-trade clause. The Phoenix Suns will likely focus on rebuilding around Booker, but limited draft assets and a high payroll complicate their options.Meanwhile, Mike Budenholzer is expected to be a sought-after candidate in this year’s coaching market.

WrestleMania 41 is already around the corner, but one major WWE Superstar is still left without an opponent that is Randy Orton . Fans were excited to see him face off against Kevin Owens, but he is out due to an unexpected injury.On a recent episode of WWE SmackDown , Kevin Owens revealed that he had suffered a neck injury and would require surgery. Orton, who was already preparing for the big event, is now left without a rival. He expressed his frustration by delivering a devastating RKO to SmackDown General Manager Nick Aldis, but as of now, no new match for The Viper has been confirmed.One theory circulating among fans is that Randy Orton might face The Rock in a surprise match at WrestleMania 41. The Rock is involved in a storyline with John Cena and Cody Rhodes, and since The Rock is also aligned with Cena, there is a chance he might interfere in the match between Cena and Rhodes. If that happens, Orton could appear to stop him, potentially leading to an impromptu showdown between the two legends.Another interesting possibility is Nick Aldis, the current General Manager of SmackDown. Aldis and Orton have had some tense moments, especially after Aldis broke the news about Owens’ injury. After taking an RKO from Orton, Aldis might be looking for some revenge. Although Aldis has never wrestled in WWE, WrestleMania could be the perfect time for him to make his debut and face Orton in a big match.Beyond The Rock and Nick Aldis, Aleister Black is one of the most exciting possibilities. WWE has been airing dark, mysterious promos on SmackDown, and many believe they are building up to a return from Black. A match between Orton and Black, two of WWE’s most intense and mysterious characters, would be a fascinating addition to WrestleMania 41.Another option could be Rusev (now known as Miro in AEW). There are rumors that he has re-signed with WWE, so a surprise return at WrestleMania to challenge Orton could make for an exciting game.Other stars would include Carmelo Hayes , Rey Fenix, or even a rising star. These up-and-coming talents could get their big break by facing someone like Randy Orton, and a match with The Viper would surely help elevate their careers.Randy Orton is one of the most iconic and well-established Superstars in WWE. With Kevin Owens sidelined due to injury, many possibilities are on the table for Orton’s opponent at WrestleMania.

Head coach Rick Tocchet opted for a talented forward group as the Vancouver Canucks were set to take on the San Jose Sharks.The Canucks are expected to ice a deep, well-rounded lineup, and their recent trend indicates they will dominate much of the play at home. Jake DeBrusk , Pius Suter , and Conor Garland make up the top lines, and Vancouver has depth in the way of young centres like Aatu Raty and Ty Mueller. Pius Suter plays down the middle on the top line with Nils Hoglander and Conor Garland, pairing speed, physicality, and goal-scoring ability.Jake DeBrusk completes the second line alongside rookie centre Ty Mueller and sniper Brock Boeser, offering offense with a mix of veteran savvy and young legs.

“I give him an…” — JJ Redick evaluates Bronny James’ rookie year in Los Angeles Lakers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/i-give-him-an-jj-redick-evaluates-bronny-james-rookie-year-in-los-angeles-lakers/articleshow/120297483.cms,"Bronny James and JJ Redick. Image via: AP

JJ Redick grades Bronny James’ Los Angeles Lakers rookie season



Bronny James wrapped up his rookie campaign with both encouraging strides and evident areas for improvement. The Los Angeles Lakers ' regular-season finale against the Portland Trail Blazers offered a starting role for Bronny with his significant milestone in his first year in the NBA. Though his performance on the stat sheet didn’t astonish the league, head coach JJ Redick had no doubts about the 20-year-old guard’s upward trajectory.Bronny James posted four points on 2-of-10 shooting with six assists and four steals in the 109-81 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. JJ Redick, however, wasn't interested in box scores. When asked to evaluate Bronny’s first NBA season, the head coach didn’t hesitate to shower praise for LeBron James’ son.“I give him an A+,” Redick said via SoCal News Group. “How he has personally handled a lot of attention, good and bad, he doesn’t even break character. He’s the same guy every day. He doesn’t allow the good attention to get to him, and he doesn’t allow the bad attention to get to him. He just continues to work.”Sunday’s game may have been Bronny’s first start. The rookie guard split time between the Lakers and their G League affiliate, the South Bay Lakers. That stint, according to Redick, was a turning point.“I thought [coach] Zach [Guthrie] and his staff did a phenomenal job with him when he was down with the South Bay Lakers,” Redick noted. “He’s improved, and we saw this particularly—you know, I went to some early games and seeing his confidence grow from October, November, to really that second part of the G League season, post Showcase, was phenomenal.”In 11 regular-season G League games, Bronny averaged 21.9 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 5.4 assists. Of course, it was a huge contrast to his 2.3 points per game in 27 NBA appearances. His career-high 39-point outing against the Santa Cruz Warriors in March was a major statement.The buzz around Bronny’s debut and development hasn’t been quiet. Social media critiques, lofty expectations, and constant media attention have had a huge impact on the young NBA star.“Thought I got better, I thought I grew as a player and a person,” Bronny told Spectrum SportsNet after the Portland game. “There’s just more work to be done. Feel like my progression has been slow, but getting better every day.”For what it's worth, Bronny has been determined to prove his case that he is all set to make his own legacy in the NBA beyond the shadow of his legendary father.“He’s a guy you can tell things to and they don’t let it affect their work or their attitude,” Redick added. “I told him I’m very high on him long-term being a part of our rotation.”Also Read: “There’s more work to be done” — Bronny James makes candid admission about his NBA debut season Bronny is getting started, and he and James are certainly one of the most talked-about father-son duos.

Madeline Gaudreau’s tattoos keep Matthew Gaudreau’s memory alive



Blue Jackets Pay Tribute To Johnny And Matthew Gaudreau

“My boys,”

“I wanted Matty’s initials to be right next to Tripp’s, as his dad will always be right next to him.”

“Mommy & Daddy’s world.”

In the quiet moments between grief and healing, some love stories find new ways to speak. For Madeline Gaudreau , the widow of former hockey player Matthew Gaudreau , her message came in ink, a tribute not only to the man she lost but also to the son they brought into the world. Nearly eight months after a devastating accident took Matthew’s life, Madeline is honoring his memory in a way that’s both deeply personal and powerfully symbolic.On April 12, Madeline shared two new tattoos on Instagram that instantly touched hearts across social media. One design features the initials “MR” and “TM” — Matthew Ryan and Tripp Matthew, their infant son. The second, placed on her forearm, is the number 21, a nod to Matthew’s college hockey jersey with the Boston College Eagles.she captioned the post, a simple phrase that says everything.In the comments, she offered more context:The ink speaks to a bond that even death can’t erase, a reminder that Matthew’s presence will forever surround their son.The Gaudreau family’s world was shattered in August 2024 when Matthew, 29, and his brother Johnny Gaudreau, 31, were struck and killed in a bike accident caused by an alleged drunk driver in Oldmans Township, New Jersey. The man behind the wheel, Sean M. Higgins, was indicted in December on charges including aggravated manslaughter. His trial remains ongoing.Before his passing, Matthew had transitioned from playing in the minor leagues, most recently with the Worcester Railers to coaching high school hockey at Gloucester Catholic High School. He wasn’t just an athlete; he was a mentor, a husband, and soon-to-be father, all roles he embraced with heart.Also Read: Watch: Alex Ovechkin’s better-half Nastasiya goes viral for her message to Wayne Gretzky after historic night Madeline gave birth to their son, Tripp, just months later in December.

When will CSK legend MS Dhoni retire from IPL? Astrologer Greenstone Lobo predicts

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings snapped their five-match losing streak, and true to form, it was captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni , ably supported by Shivam Dube ’s resilient knock, who delivered a Player of the Match performance to guide CSK to a five-wicket win.The victory marked only CSK’s second of the IPL 2025 season, as they continue to occupy the bottom spot on the points table. Reflecting on the hard-fought win, Dhoni admitted the team had endured a tough stretch and expressed hope that this result would serve as a morale booster.“It's good to win a game. When you play a tournament like this, you want to win games. Unfortunately the [earlier] matches didn't go our way for whatever reasons. There can be lots of reasons. It's good to have a win on our side. Gives confidence to the whole team and helps us improve in areas we want to improve.“We all knew that when it doesn't come your way in cricket, God makes it very tough, and it was a tough game. If you see the powerplay, whether it was the combination or the conditions, we were struggling with the ball. And then we weren't able to get the start we wanted as a batting unit. Also the fall of wickets,” Dhoni said during the post-match interview.While Dhoni earned the Player of the Match award for his quickfire 26 off 11 balls, it was Dube who anchored the chase under pressure. Though he was kept quiet early on, he turned the tide in the 19th over, punishing Shardul Thakur with a sequence that included a deft four, a six off a full toss, and capitalizing on a no-ball to help CSK score 19 runs in the over. With just four needed off the final over, Dube stayed unbeaten on 43 off 37, sealing the win with a boundary off Avesh Khan.The left-handed batter later shared insights into his approach, emphasising adaptability and composure.“This means a lot, losing 5 games in a row that is not CSK, our bowlers bowled really well and today I had wanted to stay till the end and I had this thought that I wanted to finish the game and I felt this is the time to take the game very deep after losing few wickets in the middle. It's not about the mindset and it is about playing according to the situation which is why instead of attacking, I felt taking the game deep was a better option.“My plan was very simple, which is not to try and hit the ball very hard because the bowlers were executing very well. Taking positives from this game to next game is very important,” said Dube.","Chennai Super Kings beat Delhi Daredevils by five wickets to end five-match losing streak.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Movsar Evloev lists the names of fighters he beat to justify his request for a title bout

With Alexander Volkanovski returning to the throne of the UFC featherweight championship , speculations have started spinning out within the MMA community as to who will be the next title challenger for the fighter. Amidst all these, Russian fighterhas put his name forward for a title run in the upcomingscheduled from June 25, 2025, through June 29, 2025. The recent post by the fighter has taken the internet by storm as fans reacted to the claim, urgingto make an announcement soon.Movsar Evloev is one of the top contenders in the featherweight division with an MMA record of 19-0-0. Prior to his undefeated run in the UFC, the fighter had been part of the M-1 Global promotion. Evloev, within the UFC, has defeated fighters like Aljamain Sterling, Diego Lopes, Dan Ige and Arnold Allen. In his recent post on X, the fighter sent out a message for the promotion highlighting his fighting resume that justifies him for a title run against Alexander Volkanovski in the International Fight Week.Evloev wrote, “I beat Diego Lopes, Aljamain Sterling, Arnold Allen, Dan Ige. No one has a better resume than me in 145lbs except for the Champion. I have the longest winning streak in the Featherweight Division. Me vs @alexvolkanovski end of June IFW”Fans of the combat sport, however, had a mixed reaction towards the post. While a section of the fans believes that the fighter deserves the title shot, another section dwells on the fact that the wins secured by him within the UFC were all decision-based, and not a single one of them was a finish.One of the users wrote, “9 fights 9 decisions. You lost to Diego and Aljo but got robbery wins”Contradicting the previous statement, another fan wrote, “It’s undeniable at this point, if movsar doesn’t get the next title fight this sport becomes illegitimate”“You should’ve already earned it two fights ago..@danawhite get my boy his titleshot.”“you gotta finish someone first. Take out Pico then call your shot”Also read: “Never out of the fight” - Michael Chandler perorates as UFC president Dana White praises him for being a tough fight A majority of the fans believe that the lack of finish in any of the previous bouts by Evloev will be a major reason for the fighter being denied a title shot.

Punjab Kings (PBKS) will be looking to bounce back from a morale-sapping defeat when they take on Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in Mullanpur on Tuesday. PBKS were left stunned in their previous outing as Abhishek Sharma's 141 off 55 balls overshadowed their massive 245-run total. The loss exposed Punjab's struggling bowling and sloppy fielding, with the team having already dropped 12 catches this season.The biggest concern lies in the bowling department, where even seasoned spinner Yuzvendra Chahal has leaked runs at 11.13 economy. With Lockie Ferguson ruled out indefinitely due to injury and Marco Jansen also struggling, Punjab’s attack looks vulnerable — especially against a KKR unit brimming with confidence after thrashing CSK in Chennai.The batting has shown promise, led by skipper Shreyas Iyer (250 runs), and emerging talents like Priyansh Arya and Shashank Singh. However, underperforming overseas stars Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis remain a concern.As PBKS contemplate pitch conditions — flat or spin-friendly — they’ll be wary of KKR's versatile spinners Sunil Narine and Varun Chakravarthy. With back-to-back matches lined up against KKR and RCB, Punjab's season could hinge on how they respond this week.The pitch offered balanced conditions with a few dry patches aiding both batters and bowlers. The larger square boundary (69m) and a 74m straight boundary made placement key for runs. Batting remained steady throughout, but bowlers found success with disciplined lengths. Overpitched deliveries came on nicely for batters to drive, while shorter balls sat up well. The key on this surface is hitting a good length consistently, which keeps the batters in check and prevents easy scoring. Overall, it’s a surface that rewards smart bowling and calculated strokeplay.Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh (w), Shreyas Iyer (c), Marcus Stoinis, Nehal Wadhera, Glenn Maxwell, Shashank Singh, Marco Jansen, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Xavier BartlettJosh Inglis/Yash ThakurQuinton de Kock (w), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Moeen Ali, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Vaibhav Arora, Varun ChakaravarthyAngkrish Raghuvanshi/Manish PandeyShreyas Iyer (c), Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Nehal Wadhera, Glenn Maxwell, Vyshak Vijaykumar, Yash Thakur, Harpreet Brar, Vishnu Vinod, Marco Jansen, Josh Inglis, Xavier Bartlett, Kuldeep Sen, Pyla Avinash, Suryansh Shedge, Musheer Khan, Harnoor Pannu, Aaron Hardie, Priyansh Arya, Azmatullah OmarzaiAjinkya Rahane (c), Rinku Singh, Quinton de Kock (wk), Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Rovman Powell, Manish Pandey, Luvnith Sisodia, Venkatesh Iyer, Anukul Roy, Moeen Ali, Ramandeep Singh, Andre Russell, Anrich Nortje, Vaibhav Arora, Mayank Markande, Spencer Johnson, Harshit Rana, Sunil Narine, Varun Chakravarthy and Chetan Sakariya.Defending champions KKR hold a dominant edge over PBKS, winning 21 of their 33 encounters.

The ball sat in the wicket but it was consistent throughout, it was one-paced.""I knew what my shots are, wanted to get off to a good start, and then assess it accordingly. It depends on the conditions and the ground and the dimensions.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals are set to host Mumbai Indians in their IPL 2025 clash at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday. The Hardik Pandya-led Mumbai Indians have already arrived in the capital and are currently training in the city.However, their preparations were affected as Delhi and surrounding NCR regions experienced a sudden dip in temperature on Friday, accompanied by dusty storms for the second consecutive day. The weather disrupted flight operations at the Delhi airport, leading to multiple delays and diversions — and even impacted Mumbai Indians’ practice session.In a video shared by the Mumbai Indians on their social media platforms, star batter Rohit Sharma is seen reacting humorously to the incoming storm. As strong winds hit the stadium, Rohit can be heard shouting “comeback” to his teammates. He then playfully tells the cameraman to focus on the storm instead of him.(Hey, why are you filming me? Shoot the storm instead),"" Rohit says in the clip.Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for Delhi on April 11, with temperatures expected to range between 23°C and 38°C.While the storms caused disruption, the overcast skies and cooler winds brought a brief respite from the heatwave that had gripped the region over the past week.Delhi Capitals remain the only unbeaten side in the tournament so far with four wins from four matches.Mumbai Indians, on the other hand, are struggling at the bottom half of the table — placed eighth with just one win and four defeats in five games.","Delhi Capitals host Mumbai Indians in their IPL 2025 clash on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings were dealt a major blow on Thursday as regular skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad was ruled out of the IPL due to an elbow injury. The setback has paved the way for Mahendra Singh Dhoni to return as captain for the remainder of the season, CSK head coach Stephen Fleming confirmed.Also See: IPL Live Score, CSK vs KKR ""We have an uncapped player, MS Dhoni , who will take over as captain for the remainder of the IPL,"" Fleming told mediapersons ahead of Friday’s clash against Kolkata Knight Riders .Dhoni, who captained CSK from 2008 to 2023 and led them to five IPL titles, had handed over the reins to Gaikwad ahead of the 2024 season.Ahead of the upcoming fixture, Dhoni was seen practicing at the Chepauk nets when his former CSK teammate Dwayne Bravo—now the mentor of Kolkata Knight Riders—came over to greet him.""The traitor is here,"" Dhoni remarked.""Life is so unfair,"" Bravo responded before sharing a hug with Ravindra Jadeja and then shaking hands with Dhoni.Bravo was part of Chennai Super Kings’ IPL title-winning squads in 2011, 2018, and 2021.
